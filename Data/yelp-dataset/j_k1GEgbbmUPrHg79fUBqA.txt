3	This is a great spot. Our only complaint was the waitresses and their lack of waitressing. They didn't come to out area once all afternoon and they only seemed capable of taking 1 drink order at a time and then standing at the bar while it was made. They need some tips off of the other pool bar/clubs like Aria
3	I want to like this pool, but the music NEEDS to change. They have a playlist of boring elevator music that almost put me to sleep. I understand it's the hotel pool, and you need to cater to all ages, however playing top 40s would really liven this place up a bit. Staff I was very friendly and nice, but the music makes me not want to come back.
4	Great pool atmosphere at this pool club in SLS Las Vegas. We visited here a couple times while staying at SLS over the weekend. They offered very comfy day beds, cabanas and pool pods. Also, the drinks were delicious, service was great, and music was ideal (combination of energizing and relaxing). The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is having too small of a food menu (approximately 10 items) and not having a DJ full time. I heard the Life pool will be opening in spring and I look forward to visiting there as well (as they stated it will be their venue for pool parties.
