1	Made appointment days in advance, arrived 10 minutes late and they asked to reschedule for another day due to dentist having to leave at the end of the hour.  Why would they schedule an appointment knowing the dentist will have to leave within the hour? How unprofessional and a waste of a drive and appointment. They weren't even apologetic and put the blame on me. This was an introduction appointment/1st apointment. This will not be my dentist.Hope this helps the next appointment maker.
5	Dr. Savitsky and her staff are simply amazing. Very stress free environment, made me feel like part of the family.I had 2 crowns and a filling in a single visit. My former Dentist had trouble numbing me up, Dr. Savitsky had no problem. I'm glad the office staff is considerate enough of the patients that manage ou to get to our appointments on time. I highly recommend this office to everyone I know.I wish I could give more then five stars!
5	We love this office and being new to Charlotte they have been so helpful in getting all of our records straight! Dr. Savitsky has a huge personality and is so nice! Highly recommend!
5	I am always afraid of the dentist. It's been 3 years because of really bad past experiences. Dr. Kathryn Savitsky and staff are wonderful. She was so friendly and patient with my concerns. I have trouble getting numb and in the past have been told to "suck it up and deal with the pain." She was able to numb me completely and I never felt a thing.....nothing. My relief in finding a great dentist is priceless!!! I actually can't wait to come back for my cleaning.
