5	This CVS just recently opened.  It is in a good location with plenty of parking and easy to get in and out of.  The staff are all very friendly.  I have a CVS rewards card and they emailed me a 30% off coupon and did it ever save the day for me!  With Mother's Day and Teacher Appreciation this coupon really came in handly.  It does not apply to any sales item however.
5	Awesome. Love CVS. Pharmacist there is always very helpful and answers all my questions :)
