5	Doc Popcorn has landed in Scottsdale, AZ.  Located in Scottsdale Fashion Center on the 3rd floor by Nordstroms, you will find the best popcorn in town.  If you can't see the bright yellow signs, you will be able to smell the buttery, perfectly popped corn wafting through the mall. They have all sorts of cool interesting flavors like cinnamon and jalepeno.  THey also have the classics like butter, cheddar, kettle corn and more!  It's all popped fresh right there and are naturally flavored. Pick up a bag and chomp away!
4	The friendly staff there were kind to let us sample. We ended up buying a bag of caramel popcorn. It was still warm. It was a perfect snack to walk around the mall with.
4	Their Jalapena & Carmel Kettle Corn is "off the charts". Catch Diana for the best service in Scottsdale. Make the effort to find them on the third floor, by Nordstrom's. More locations around the Valley will be opening in 2013. A FUN, TASTY afternoon treat !!
