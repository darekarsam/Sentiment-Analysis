5	I needed my car serviced and stopped at a different business first. They weren't open. I went home and read a rather scathing review of that business and decided to pass. That same review recommended Tom's, and as it was close I decided to give them a go. The office wasn't particularly nice as one would find in other shops, but this is a garage. What do you expect. The people were friendly, and the price was fair. They saw some fluid leaks on my car and cleaned them up so we could better see where the problems were. They suggested at this time to just keep an eye on them. They didn't pressure me to take care of them now. ! I was going to a shop in north Gilbert, but as these guys are a lot closer I think I'll continue with them.
5	Tj took the time to inspect the work done on my car from a different place. I couldn't believe it! He took the time to personally walk me through everything. Showing me the problems under my car and under the hood! Explained it all and answered my questions for me to best understand. I was soo pleased with them! The only other time I've had service like that is whenever my dad does the work on my vehicle! They fixed the horrible work done to my car from the previous shop and even did more! They didn't tell me what they will and won't do like the previous shop either. I felt comfortable and extremely happy to have found this repair shop.   This shop is no where near where I live but I would totally go out of my way to come back to this shop!
5	I'm not a car person and therefore am at the mercy of what an auto mechanic tells me I need when my car needs maintenance and repairs. I've been a customer of Tom's for three years and have always felt they have been fair and honest with me. Nice people, reasonable prices, good work done efficiently. It's not fancy, but who cares? I'm a fan.
