3	This location has been turned over so many times and vacant for so long, it's great to see something here that looks like it will stay a while. Though with TJ Maxx right next door, I wonder if it was the best choice. But hey, I'm no retail expert. What do I know.It's a very large shop and while the name is "Coat Factory" they sell all the usual department store stuff. Men's clothing, Women's clothing, kids, housewares. There is a very good selection of coats with a variety of styles and prices. I actually bought a nice coat for $40, but there were options as high as $200.Checkout was a little slow. Plenty of parking, but watch yourself here because the traffic moves fast.

I was looking for a suit for my friend, and the staff there walked me through sizing and styling for men's formal wear.  They even went as far as modeling the clothes for me up and down the aisles!  The most fun I've ever had shopping :)
3	This place is huge. As a male yelper, I wish that stores like this would focus more on equality in choices. You walk in and the men's section is in the left corner, while the women's section takes more than half of the building. It is just sometimes hard to find your sizes. This is place is more like a new clothes only thrift story and you have to get lucky to find something in your size that you like. The kitchen section is awesome. I am a huge fan of cheap kitchen gadgets and bakeware.
