4	Nice, clean laundromat. Plenty of new machines, and the dryers are great too. I wish they some of those baskets on wheels to carry the clothes from the washer to the dryer. I always end up dropping items. It's in a great location. Theres a Circle K, a bar, and a Mexican restaurant in the same shopping plaza. So,l you can grab a drink or a meal while you're washing your clothes!
5	Good facilities, easy access, relatively well maintained.  I always come here for my laundry.
5	Decent facilities. One reason I gave it five stars is because the owner was super nice and friendly to everyone. He was cleaning and sprucing up the place while I was doing my laundry. Also, I didn't have to wait for a machine and I did laundry in under an hour because of the super speedy dryers!
2	At 5 a.m. it was filthy. The washers were anyway and there is only one cart and there was what appeared to be a homeless person sleeping on the chairs. Two stars for being open 24 hours. Will not return. Sorry.
1	Got here and the place was empty and clean. Next a man on a bike comes in and sits down. No idea why. Then a lady who looked to be on drugs starts talking to a man in a BMW right in front of this place. She walks in here and talks to the man who came here with the bike and walks right back out and into the BMW. I'm thinking that woman's pimp or drug dealer. Another man sits here in the place not doing laundry either. He did leave but omg I had my 3 kids and it was pretty scary. No employee was here at the place to keep these people out.
