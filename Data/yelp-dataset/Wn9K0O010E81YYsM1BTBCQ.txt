4	I was not quite sure what to expect from the trolley car diner exterior of Pizzaiolle, but the service, the food, and the wine, were all quite good.  The decor is quite modest, so I would not have picked this out for a special occasion, but the food did not disappoint.  I order the farfalle with wine sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, and pancetta.  The pasta was al dente, which is perfect for me, and the sauce, although a bit salty, added just the right amount of flavor.  I would definitely stop back in for an Italian meal.
3	Situated in what used to be the Galaxy Diner, the Pizzaiolle on Saint-Denis still has that old diner feel. It's not trendy or chic, but it's cozy. This is my comfort food. It's perfect for one of those casual nights when you just want to relax away from the crowd. Slide into a booth, sit back, and catch up with an old friend or two. Order a glass of Italian red. Pizzaiolle is the only place where I always get the same thing: the Capretto (tomato sauce, fresh basil, and goat cheese) on whole wheat crust. Simple, yet so satisfying. Their pizzas are made on a wood oven, and are always solid. Prices are pretty reasonable.
3	Pros- Great ambience- Friendly staff- Great apps- Good tomato sauce- Fair pricingCons- Except for the duck sausage pizza, menu is uninspired- Pizza/cheese was a touch too oily/soggy in the middle
