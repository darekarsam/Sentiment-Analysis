1	DO NOT SHOP HERE! I purchased a vaporizer (electronic cigarette) and it worked for a couple days and I don't smoke very much and it stopped working. Assuming I could take it back, I walked back into the store with my cigarette and asked him what I could do about it (because they don't accept returns.) He got very aggressive and told me to get the f out. I asked him to see his business license (which is supposed to be posted in a conspicuous located) he refused and started to bang on the desk and told me to get the f out. I honestly don't think this is a legitimate business. They also knowingly sell detective merchandise and at a ridiculous price. Next time just go to High maintenance smoke shop, they offer the same things for a better price, without the aggressive attitude.
5	I got my first vape pen here. Mohammad has been extremely helpful with it. Mohammad goes above and beyond to help customers. The staff in general really care about their customers. Very reasonable prices and great selection!
5	This place is by far the best smoke shop around.  I live in Queen Creek and I prefer to make the 30+ minute drive just for my vaping needs.  The prices are the best your gonna get (even better than the internet site I have been using for years). The guy that works there is awesome!  I have been having issues with my battery and he fixed the problem no questions asked!  He is very nice and really goes the extra mile to help out his customers!!  Thank you Angel Eyes!!
5	I was expecting to pick up a lil pipe for some dank meddies but with prices like these I was able to get a nice water piece with double percolators. Between the prices selection and service i'm one happy midnight toker. Its good to know that there is a local business that treats everyone with respect.
