1	Was looking for a new place... Told the stylest what I want and she said okay no problem and spun me to the tv screen. She quickly hacked away at my hair giving me a 7.99 haircut treatment. I was spun back around , now facing the mirror with almost no hair left. I will never visit again.
1	When it comes to a haircut, you can either go to a cheap place like Great Clips, or you can spend more money to get a great haircut with a stylist that takes their time. I went to this place for a hair cut assuming that the bigger price tag would mean a great hair cut. Boy was I wrong. I was greeted kindly by the two ladies at night. Note I stopped short by calling them hair stylists, much the same way I stop short in calling Great Clips employees stylists. For the higher price, I got a quick buzz cut with someone who didn't check to make sure the cut was even. I was in and out of that chair in 5 minutes. For the price, that isn't something I expect.If you want to pay more for a similar hair cut to the cheap franchises, THIS is the place to go. You will love it here. For me ... someone who expects a GREAT haircut for a higher price, I'm going someplace else. If I want this type of hair cut, I'm saving money and going to Great Clips.For the owner, you need to get rid of the young brunette girl at night. She is terrible as a hair cutter (not stylist), and makes your business look bad.
1	I've gone back to this particular Sport Clips for the last time. I'm done trying to explain to these folks how to fix, crooked, choppy or what tapering means. Christ, last nights haircut is something I could have done in a mirror. Go to the one up the road in Mckellips  or on Sugnal Bute. I've never had a complaint about either.
