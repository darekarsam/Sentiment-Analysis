5	Dakota Chase is the cutest salon ever.  Everyone is always super friendly and Scotty is amazing.  Ask for him and tell them Amy sent you. :)
5	I've being going to Dakota Chase for approximate 12 yrs, Jamie my stylist is amazing I follow her wherever she goes. She takes good care of my hair ensuring it stays healthy - considering all the coloring I do. Jamie's hair cuts are always so sexy. I have never left her shop until we are both satisfied.  I could go to other stylists close to home but I choose Jamie, for her creativity, and care.Highly recommend Jamie - Dakota & Chase.
5	I absolutely LOVE this Salon!  It's quiet...very chic and I just adore my stylist, Emily Taylor-Gradoville!  I have had many stylists over the years....moving from one state to another, it's really difficult to find someone new...but Emily is AMAZING!!!  Tell her what you want or are looking for in a color or style and you walk out a HAPPY Client !!!  I have never had SO many compliments on my hair - EVER !I would recommend Emily to anyone I meet or know!
