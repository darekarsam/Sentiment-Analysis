4	Good and timely service.  No problems with anything.  I did order extra pizza sauce but didn't get it.  I had the wings and they were fine.
2	So I ordered a pizza from this place a few weeks ago. It was rather late and I wasn't sure if it would let me order since it was about 10 minutes before they closed but it let me place the order online. I was excited because I was starving! I ended up getting a phone call 5 minutes later from the manager saying that I had placed the order too late and that she had to cancel the order. Dominos would have delivered it to me had I placed the original order through them, but that's beside the point. Anyway, because of the inconvenience, she offered to give me 50% off my next order as long as I called to place the order. I just tried placing the exact order but was told they couldn't honor the 50% off because my order was a special and they couldn't combine the offers. Um? That's not what the manager told me when she offered it to me. I literally placed the EXACT same order but couldn't use it. I asked what I could use it for and was told anything that wasn't a special. I told the guy I wanted the same thing as the special and asked how much it would be... It was the same price as the special. Um? What's the point in offering me 50% off if you're just going to charge me the same price as the special that ANYONE else could order. That doesn't really seem to make much sense or seem fair. I was being given 50% off because of an inconvenience you caused me. That's not my fault. You should have honored what the manager originally told me. I haven't tasted the food yet as I just placed the order so my review is based on customer service alone.
