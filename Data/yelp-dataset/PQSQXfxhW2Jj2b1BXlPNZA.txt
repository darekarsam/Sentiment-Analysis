4	I hadn't been to this place in a really long time (3 yrs) since the last time I was there I was passed over and ignored.  I ended up walking out of the salon without a pedicure.  I decided to give them another shot! I went with a girlfriend to get a pedicure this time.  We were able to get right in to the chairs. Their massage chairs are kind of old, but they work really well. The prices were about average of other nail salons in the area.  We chose the deluxe spa pedicure.  This came with sugar scrub, callus removal, warm towel and a hot stone massage for only $28.  It was a great experience.  I think we will be back!
1	Went to get my broken gel nail fixed, and she used pink gel instead of white. When I pointed it out, she told me no.. they are the same. Those are just old. I got them done a week ago and there is an obvious difference between white and pink. She would not correct it. Now I have 9 white and one pink.
