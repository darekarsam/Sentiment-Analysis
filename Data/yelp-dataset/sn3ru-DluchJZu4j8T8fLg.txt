2	I travel for business and this is usually where I stay. But on this last trip it was freezing cold, think 28 degrees, and the water in the room did not get hot...it was lukewarm at best and for this Texas girls I was none too happy about it. I reported this to the front desk and was told that maintenance would check it out in the morning. They did and it was a major problem which would not be fixed until after I was already gone. Not nice! Anywho they did comp me one night's stay, good for my company since they were expensing the trip but didn't make much difference to me since I was still taking cold showers. The two stars is for the fresh fruit and hot coffee every morning.
3	Being a long term Marriott customer I always have high expectations of their properties. This one turned out nicely. While I had to stay out here it was a nice surprise to find it clots to good dining and shopping. The water was fine this time for me. Only downside is the property next door must rent long term because there where a lot of kids hanging out in the parking lot next door which makes me worry about vehicle theft issues.Also didn't get the best room I would have expected for being such a long time Marriott rewards member, the place was almost empty. Just shows you that they save the good rooms for last. Try harder to make your long term customers happy guys!
5	Just checked in and Morgan was a first class guy who works the desk!  Good place for the night!
