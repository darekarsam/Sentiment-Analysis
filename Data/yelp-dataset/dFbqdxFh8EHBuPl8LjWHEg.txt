5	Steven Martz and Charlotte Burr take the time to get the very best insurance products for their customers.  It was  nice to work with them in person, I didn't feel like just another number.  If you are sick of paying too much for insurance give Steven and Charlotte a call to see if they can help.  I'm glad I joined the AZ insurance team, its hard to find people you can trust now a days!
5	I've just received a quote for insurance from Charlotte and we are switching all of our  insurance to them.   We already have our business insurance through them and we   love the service so much that we asked them to provide a quote for our personal insurance.  They are going to save us a lot of money on our premiums!  Great service at a lower cost...what more could you ask for?
5	Great customer service & great rates! We switched our car & homeowners insurance to Az Insurance . They were quick to respond with quotes & information on all of their services & saved us a great deal of money on our policies!
5	Charlotte with AZ Insurance Team is extremely knowledgeable and she cares about educating her clients on being properly protected. I would strongly suggest encourage using AZ Insurance Team for any of your Insurance needs, WHY? Because Charlotte's #1 Goals is to help you find you the best solution for your business, bottom line. Kudos to Charlotte with AZ Insurance Team!!!!  - Anthony Johnson, Owner Mava Consulting
5	Charlotte and her team really helped us out. We recently purchased our first home, and they all helped us every step of the way when deciding which home insurance was the best. They also seriously helped when we bought our first car.  Charlotte answered our call in the middle of the night. We definitely recommend this company.
