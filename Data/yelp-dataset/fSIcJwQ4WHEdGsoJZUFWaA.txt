3	Great food and good drinksIs Very Unorganised!Staff is unhelpful!!!
2	We've been to Foodies Festivals before, but this was the first we'd been to at the EICC. Unfortunately, we went on Saturday, and it was beyond crowded and verging on dangerous. They should have allowed much more space between stands to reduce the crush, making grazing more pleasurable, and rendering it safe for pushchairs and wheelchairs. While there was little knew in terms of exhibitors, the quality was high and the samples good. The Extraordinary Sausage Company, in particular, was doing a roaring trade throughout the day, with some excellent produce; I recommend their sausages with Scotch Bonnet peppers. Unfortunately, the crowds they generated added to the crush. A good time, then, but disappointingly badly organised.
3	Living social customer care has come up trumps and credited my account.They have some great deals just take note of mismatch in booking and expiry dates so you don't get caught outEnjoy
