1	I had been taking my kids to this office for 14 years. I have seen all the doctors at this location.  After 14 years we had developed a relationship with everyone there.  Today, we were literally 7 minutes late to the appointment and we were refused service by Dr. Wallace.  This was probably our first time being late, and yes we should have not been late.  However, there was nobody else waiting to be seen, and we have had to wait for the doctor plenty of times ourselves.  This was just mean and thoughtless behavior.  We will take our 14 year relationship somewhere else!!!
1	I went there once and never returned again. The staff was rude and complained about me not having the paperwork ready for my kids first appointment. That was my fault. However, I could hear the front desk talking about me and I was the only one there with my 2 kids. My advice to them would be to close the door next time they want to speak rudely about someone. When we left, we were still the only ones there at the office as far as I could tell.
