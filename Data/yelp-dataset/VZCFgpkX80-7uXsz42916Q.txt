5	This Bottega Veneta boutique is very small. They seem to only carry the classic styles in the permanent collection. No shoes and very few accessories.The people who work here are absolutely fantastic. It's like they took a bunch of happy pills with their breakfast. Had I won in Vegas, I would have come straight to this boutique. BV is my kryptonite. I love you.
4	Drink , Drank, Drunk...I love this place I've never gone for dinner I always sit at the bar and have a couple cocktails their menus are on iPads which I think are totally unique and fun and I just love the location read between the Wynn and Encore and it's great...
