3	Still no flying piggy bank.Store was crowded, so was the parking lot.   The check out lines were not long, was the first person in line behind someone checking out.  Be sure to bring your own bags and you can load them at the counter in the front of the store.Brand new in an old store grocery that has been remodeled, so nice and clean and not to big (Yea!) but seemed to be a little to small.  There tends to be one well know brand and BD's My Essential cheaper brand.  Pricing is low on many items, competitive with Aldi or other discount groceries except there are a few really low prices on some items to get you into the store, so stock up on those.   Nice to add another competitor in the area.The produce department was nice, fresh and had its own little cold room, this is just like the other BD's in the area.   Lots of fresh produce.  You can get some great bargains if you want and are a careful shopper.
1	the manager is an arrogant female.  She is about as helpful and kind as a flying pig.  the store is a hoax.  make sure you know you prices...there are far more competitive prices in the area and add a coupon to the competitor and your really in business......stay away from this freak show....the meat is gross and the shelf product is second hand stale.
