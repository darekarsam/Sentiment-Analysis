4	I mean, it's Nordstrom Rack. I am ready to be the first one in line Friday Morning.I'll update my review after I check out the vibe, merchandise and layout. So excited that this is opening near me : )
5	This store has great staff and wonderful merchandise. Everything is well sorted and displayed ( not a mess ) . The female cashier with dark long hair  who returned my Hautelook orders were very patient and sweet. The male cashier with the tattoos was engaging and funny! They both liked talking about clothes , which was nice. The blond male dressing room attendant was also super friendly and not grumpy that I gave him back items I was not purchasing. ( normally I cringe when dealing with unhappy dressing room staff, so thank you!) But don't worry we purchased a bunch of great things!  The only thing that threw me off was were the store placed the check out line. Normally the check out lines are in the front of the store . Look to your far right against the wall ! This will be my go-to location for now on! Thank  you for a nice experience;)
3	A smaller nordstrom rack.. maybe the smallest ive been to. But as always has a lot of items to look for and since there is a lot of designer not the epic sales you hope.. but there are always some staple pieces you cant live without.
4	Compare to the rest of the nordy rack stores, this one by far has no good items. Couldn't find anything good here.
