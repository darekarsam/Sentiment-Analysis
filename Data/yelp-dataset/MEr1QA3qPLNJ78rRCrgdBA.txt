4	When I moved to Charlotte in 2008, I was not looking forward to finding a new barber.  It took me years to find one when I lived in my last city, and I moved almost immediately afterwards.It's not that I'm picky.  I just have several prominent cowlicks that many barbers have no idea what to do with - were they absent that day in barber school?  Also, I hate anything resembling a salon, and I don't like paying over $15 plus tip for a haircut.   All I want is a place where the magazine selection doesn't include Cosmo, and where I can leave without feeling like I just paid out the nose for something I could have done better myself.Colonial Barber Shop was the first barber I tried here in Charlotte, but unfortunately the $18 price tag prompted me to try pretty much every other barber shop in the city over the next 3 years.  They all sucked - expect a long string of negative barber shop reviews to follow.  The shop itself is great - the barbers are all very friendly and they even have a shoe shine station.  Most importantly, they consistently deliver great haircuts and I've never been disappointed.  The price is still higher than I like to pay, but it beats having a horrible haircut.  I guess two out of three ain't bad.  I just wish I'd stuck with this place from the beginning and saved myself a three year search.

1	Worst barbershop I've ever experience DON'T GET YOUR HAIR CUT HERE. I went there on a Friday and business was terrible the barbers are untrained and this is truly a mom and pops shop I don't see how they've accomplished getting a barber's license the lady didn't even know how to edge a hairline worst place inexperienced and untrained service is exactly what I received don't be the next.
5	Great, Todd is a great barber. Comfortable chairs and a razor neck shave. Very affordable.
