3	Good selection of used games and they always have the newest, latest, greatest games.  The employees are nice and love their games.
5	every time i go in here, there's this guy who seems like he's in his 20's [Richard or Robert *i'm really bad with names*] but he's the most helpful person there. he's got tattoos that show, but it just puts  you at ease  because that's what most gamers are like.
2	Game stop policy is being abused here. First, I tried to sell a game that was unopened and given to me as a gift. I didn't want it and the store I got from would only exchange for the same title. I was told that their policy prevents from buying sealed games. It would've been very easy for the manager to tell me I could just open it but I guess that would decrease the value? Well, OK. Policy is policy. So, another day I actually bought a brand new title at full price. The brand new titles are opened and resealed by the staff. This is also a policy but apparently they use this for the employees to test out the games because upon returning home, the brand new disk had a big scratch in it. I returned it immediately only to be questioned about how the scratch got there. It wasn't more then ten minutes after purchasing. Still, I understood but the attitude from that same manager was poor. He asked if I wanted it back on the card I purchased it with. I said yes but then started to hand me cash. Just unprofessional but what more can you expect from a store run by kids? Would rather buy from a major store. Don't need the hassle.
