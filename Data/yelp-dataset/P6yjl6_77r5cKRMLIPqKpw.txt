5	Their pistachio macarons make me wish time could stand still.
2	I had a lemon tart here that wasn't fantastic.  I've had fresher with more lemon flavour. A plus is that they serve Kusmi teas (with a huge selection), and also that the piece of chocolate that came with the tea was actually very tasty.The service was good, ambiance was ok as well. They also have a nice patio outside.Probably won't make a special trip to return back here but wouldn't rule it out if I happened to be in the neighbourhood and wanted a coffee.
3	We came here looking for a chocolate box gift, and we were pleasantly surprised to find a pretty good range of beautiful chocolate including a few truffles. They have some pretty unique flavours including almond sesame, chai tea caramel, red wine, and fleur de sel butter caramel. I decided to pick up an almond croissant along with our gift, and it was flaky and delicious. I've heard good things about the hot chocolate here, but didn't get to try it on this particular visit.
3	Was walking around the area and found this place. It's a little tight with a few tables, but there's a lot of selections. During this visit, I got a chocolate croissant and tried their cocoa. I didn't ask to heat the croissant up since it was just made, but they did it anyway. So customer service was good. I'd recommend it as a good spot to rest if you've been walking around too much during afternoons when the weather sucks and you're wondering why you're visiting a country up north when it's winter!
5	A great place for pastries, chocolates, sandwiches and salads. The 75% hot chocolate was the best I've ever had. I may drive home through Montreal just to go back to Marius et Fanny!
