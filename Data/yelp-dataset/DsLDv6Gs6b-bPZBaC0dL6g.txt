4	Cindy does an excellent job grooming and her daughter is very friendly and very mature. They all seem to be compassionate & caring for our furry kids.
1	DO NOT GO HERE! An hour after we returned home my dog started licking his stomach and crying. He had razor burn all over his stomach. When confronted Cindy started yelling and refused a refund even after the vet said it was because of her terrible grooming. I have posted pictures of the burns on my dogs stomach, however Yelp has removed them because they are horrific.
3	Cindy does an amazing job as does her daughter. However, her new staff is less than friendly/helpful. Unfortunately,  I will not be going back. I expect a certain level of service and customer service for the price we pay to groom our dogs. I have never left a groomer with my dogs still covered in hair...unless I'm something missing.
5	Tammy Harper is the BEST! She grooms our 3 Shelties to perfection and always remembers baseball accessories. ;) Her staff is so sweet too. Our pups love their spa day!
