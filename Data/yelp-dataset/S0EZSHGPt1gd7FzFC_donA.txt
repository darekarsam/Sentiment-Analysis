4	My wife and I have been eating at Bamboo 7 since it opened a couple years ago. It is a nice small restaurant with great food and reasonable prices. The food has always been consistent whether we go for lunch or dinner. We like the place so much that the staff knows what we like to drink & what appetizers & main courses we are most likely to have. We have eaten at a lot of Chinese restaurants in the Charlotte metro area but we prefer eating at Bamboo 7.
4	Great food at great prices and yes they do deliver.  I just wish they would bring down the minimum order for delivery from $15 to $10.  Sometimes I just don't want that much food for lunch.
4	I love this place!  I eat here often when I'm looking to get some Asian takeout.  The staff is always friendly and eager to help!The chicken fried rice and General Tso's chicken are favorites of mine.  Their lunch specials are cheap and tasty.  Two of my lunch favorites are the egg drop soup and the wonton soup.  Both are very cheap ($1.50 and $1.95, I think) and just down right good.I've had the Pad Thai here as well.  It's good but a little sweet for me sometimes.  I like my Pad Thai a little spicer, but it's still pretty good.  I give them a solid 4 stars for the entrees that I've had so far!
2	My wife and I recently ate at Bamboo 7 and were disappointed with our meal. We started off with the fried wontons that are given to every table. There was something off about the wontons both in flavor and texture. We mentioned our concerns to the waitress who laughed at us! Seriously wtf? We spoke to the owner a bit later and she gave us a fresh bowl but the problem remained. Strike #1. I ordered Szechuan Beef as my entree. I ordered it hot and spicy and it came out mild. Strike #2. Apparently the waitress didn't see any problem even when it was pointed out to her that no red peppers were present. My wife's meal and that of her friend's were also bland and tasteless. What a shame. We've been dining here since they opened.
4	So we went to Bamboo 7 last night for dinner. I had an eggroll & the house lo mein. Both were very good. We spent a long time talking with the owner catching up.
5	Great service. Great for families.  Wonderful food.
4	Best Chinese/Thai takeout in Ballantyne.  The owner, Anna, is always extremely friendly, will soon know you by name, and can tell you what your order is before you've even placed it!  We are lucky to have Bamboo 7 in walking distance because you can't beat the menu, the prices, and most importantly, the quality and flavor profiles.  Everything is super fresh!   It even offers a nice, intimate setting for dining-in and a more elegant menu of House Specialties that go well above and beyond typical Chinese takeout items.  We love this place.
5	Hands down this is the BEST food. Everything was cooked perfectly, and their sauces are to die for. Portions are big and they don't skimp on any meat in their dishes. Their appetizers are amazing. And when we ordered a big takeout order they offered a free two-liter of soda. Definitely going back on a regular basis.
5	Love this place.  Good food, service and atmosphere.  After a few visits, they know your order before you place it, which is cool.  The owner is really nice, and the staff is very attentive.  Highly recommned this place.  Nice little hidden gem in Ballantyne.
5	Here we are again... 2/3/13  My last review was 9 months ago! It was nice to see that there were a couple other diners that evening. I started off with a bowl of Hot & Sour soup followed by what I call an endless soup. The menu calls it Vietnamese rice noodle soup with beef. It comes in an oversize bowl & I'm lucky if I can make the level drop 2" before I'm full. I like the soup because its loaded with tender beef. The broth is excellent too. Its a combination of very subtle flavors much like a fine wine.My wife had Crispy Tofu & Beef with Broccoli. All in all it was a very pleasant evening.
5	Moo shi pork is what I'll be having tonight. Its not on the menu but Anna said it wouldn't be a problem to make. I was literally amazed by what happened next. As I know and others who have eaten here know the food is consistently excellent.What emerged from the kitchen was a huge plate of Moo Shi Pork & six pancakes. After some light banter between Anna & myself she demonstrated to me exactly how to fill the pancakes. My efforts looked like a toddler attempting to stuff a burrito shell with Legos. It was great too. I really can't wait to go back & try the chicken & shrimp versions.When it came time to get to go boxes Anna went the extra distance & wrapped up the leftovers into pancakes for me to take home. I've never had that level of dedication to detail at any restaurant I've ever eaten at. Bamboo 7 has the best service period.
5	Great food... Fast delivery'
5	(3/22/13) Let's see what tonight brings. Tonight it was hot & sour soup followed by fried pork dumplings & Moo Shu Pork. I couldn't resist ordering it again. It was excellent just like it was the last time. Anna once again went above & beyond my expectations to make a memorable meal for my wife & I.
5	(4/21/2013) My teeth absolutely ache tonight.  I need soft food and here we are at Bamboo 7. Poor Anna.  Her restaurant is empty. But it makes for a very private dining experience for my wife and I.  I'm going to order steamed pork dumplings, crabmeat and asparagus soup and moo shu beef. I know that everything will be delicious. And like always it is. Zit was a perfect meal.
5	This Chinese place is so so so clean I love it. The food has a very very fresh taste. The attention is beyond awesome must try it out.
4	I live directly across the street from B7.  I finally stopped in for takeout on my way home last night from work.  The Yelp reviewts are outstanding.   I was not disappointed.  Since it was already after 8 and I was starving, I chose the chicken lo mein.  I was immediately acknowledged when I came in and quickly handed a menu, and give time to choose my order.  While waiting for the lo mein I found the location quaint, smaller than expected yet cozy, too.  Small nice bar in the front and the main dining separated from it by a screen.  Low lighting and cushioned chairs for the tables.  Very relaxing atmosphere with, of course a fish tank.  Then menu includes classic chinese, some vietnamese and japanese selections.  My chicken lo mein was piping hot, very savory and loaded with plenty of meat.  Glad I finally made it there.  I do wish they had a sushi menu and maybe a bit more japanese selections.
5	this place is legit. I got the sesame chicken and it came with tons of chicken and fried rice. the place was clean and very quite. No doubt that i will be going back.
5	(7/5/13) Well well well Bamboo 7 is actually full of people. I guess that July 5th is a popular evening for Chinese food. Anyway I ordered fried tofu, pork fried dumplings,  an egg roll and white corn bisque. I'm having moo shu beef as my main course. Gingerale is the drink of choice since lemonade isn't offered anymore. I really appreciate Anna's flair for presentation both in having the Moo Shu Beef made for me & also rolling it up into egg roll skins. As always it was a very flavorful & enjoyable meal.
4	Small place. Very rarely is there anyone in the dining room. But quick takeout. Very hot and fresh.
5	This our favorite delivery place, but they have a nice restaurant too. Very small but nice ambience. They are courteous, even when calling in an order near closing. They always get the order right and are fast. Large portion sizes with plenty of meat and veggies. We ordered for 4 the other night and got a free 2-liter, which was unexpected but nice. They pay attention to detail and add little touches like cucumber with shrimp sauce on the side when you order crab rangoon. Pad Thai is excellent. Fried rice has flavor. Fried veggie spring rolls are small but are perfectly crispy. Order plenty-you will want more! Crab rangoon is the best I've ever had. Prices may be a little higher than other delivery places, but the food definitely tastes better than most Chinese/Thai takeout. So glad we found this place!
4	I stopped in for a quick lunch on Saturday between 12 - 1 and was the only person in the place.  Of course, since I was the only dine-in patron at the time, my service was super-quick.  I decided that I wanted something semi-healthy, so I ordered chicken with broccoli and steamed rice instead of fried rice.  The plate came with a small spring roll as well.  The food was pretty good but not the very best I have had. For a small Asian place in a strip shopping center though, I thought the quality of the food was pretty good.And,  I certainly have no complaints about the service -it was good. Pricing for lunch was cheap -  only $5.95 before tax! You can't beat that!
5	I love this place and I am addicted to the Hong Kong style wonton noodle soup. I get it take out and enjoy it at home with lots of Siracha. Delicious, hot and fresh. Very convenient online ordering.
4	We were a bit hesitant to stop in casually with the family because we were not sure of the pricing but were we ever surprised.  As long as you make conscious choices, the menu can fit any budget!  The food was absolutely great and the presentation was amazing.The only drawback I saw was the size. Small and intimate, any more than a handful of customers can make this restaurant fill up in a hurry.  If it is not busy, this little hide-a-way is a great night out to start a night on the town as well.
2	This place had good reviews so we tried it , it got busy but u could hear the phone ring every five seconds so I cod see this being a take out only place . I love Chinese and this place was not good it was edible and that's all .. We will not be back
5	My family owns the martial arts school in the shopping center so we are neighbors to Bamboo so we also come done often. And I have to say I have no problem with that. The food here is absolutely amazing I am still yet to find a Chinese restaurant that can beat the quality of these guys their food is very good and over the almost I believe 5~6 years that we've been eating here they have yet to fail on making us happy, and their food has yet to disappoint me as well. The owner, Anna, is very personal and very nice, she can look tired at times but she does not let that affect her. If you want good Chinese food for a fair price you've got to come to Bamboo. I've had numerous different dishes here and they are all very tasty and flavorful.
5	This is the best Chinese food around! Always great ! We've tried a lot different ones. By far #1 on  my list!!
5	Best Chinese restaurant in Charlotte!!  Sui Mui is great and the beef chow fun and chicken and beef brocolli all fantastic!!
1	I'm sure there are good entrees at this place, but when I look for Chinese food, I'm looking for a good deal on the lunch combos.  In this area, I feel like Bamboo 7 totally fails.  All you get is a small portion of whatever dish you have chosen and some rice with soy sauce.  To call it fried rice is an insult to fried rice.  Give me some veggies and egg in the rice at the very least!  No egg roll or spring roll included either, had to order these separate and pay extra.
5	Best Chinese food around. I love the cucumber in with the sesame chicken. Beef is tender.  I order the general Taos  it's the best around!!
5	I just discovered Bamboo 7 a couple weeks ago and I have literally been here like 5 times since. I'm an Asian food addict and this place is an amazing fix.From the outside, you might not be too sure. To be honest, I wasn't sure if it was even open when I saw it the first time. I gave it a whirl and the inside was very clean and nice looking I knew it had potential. We've all been to that hole in the wall Chinese place that ended up being terrible but this isn't that place. Bamboo 7 is a gem.My server is always so friendly and nice and at this point, she knows my order. I get the wonton soup and the pork potstickers. Sort of the same thing but they're my favorites. The wonton soup is so good. The broth has a great flavor and a lot of depth and the wontons are not falling apart in the soup either. The only thing I wish was different about the soup is that it had some veggies in there, but I know that' not the traditional way. The potstickers. DAMN, THEY ARE GOOD. These things are my favorite, I don't think I can come here without getting them. They even come in the authentic basket thing and even though they are steamed, hey are al dente and never slimy. Someone said this place is the best Chinese in Charlotte - I believe it.
4	The food is great ..we had curry chicken . sesame chicken and tempura shrimp .hot and sour soup .all of  the food was great ...
4	Loved it. Crunchy batter fried chkn with pineapple. delicious lettuce wraps. Quaint and casual but nice, very clean. Went late lunch on a Sunday, just our table. Nice and quiet.
5	This place is fantastic. We got takeout and the food was excellent. They did forget my spring rolls, but we're very apologetic and the food made up for it. I had to drive by multiple Chinese restaurants to get to this one. Absolutely worth the drive.
1	I'm sorry, but this is not a Pad Thai, the food was awful... the service.. nobody checked on us, I have to look for somebody to bring me the bill. Never ever back here!!!
3	This is a great lunch or take-out spot. speedy, tasty and well priced. I've been going to this place for years. The soups, chicken and broccoli and noodles are all good choices. You can't beat a lunch special for under $6 bucks. They even deliver locally.
2	First time I ate there I loved it.I ate in the restaurant.Next time I carried out the same order and was un- satisfied .
