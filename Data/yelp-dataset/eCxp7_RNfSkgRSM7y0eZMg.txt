3	Same as any Gap. But beer makes it better.
4	To my knowledge, this is the only Gap Body in Las Vegas, unless you count the one at the Forum Shops, which is just a section of the Gap store and pretty much just carries underwear. This one has more selection by far.The sales associate made the unfortunate mistake of being friendly and helpful. Sales associates be warned: I DO want your help! Unless you work at Victoria's Secret. Then, go away and let me shop for underwear in peace. Otherwise, I like salespeople. Can you help me find this in another size? What about this one? Can I have a dressing room? Does this come in other colors? What else do you have in this fabric? Yes, please check every other store in the vicinity. OOH! I love THAT shirt. Where is it? You only have the one on the mannequin? Yes, please get it down for me. When I was a sales associate, I loved customers like me, although I understand that not everyone feels this way. The staff at GAP was very accommodating and had no problem helping out in any way they could.
3	So what happens when you're going to a conference but you forget your pants and all you have to wear is the shorts you have on?Well, you go to the Gap and quickly purchase some trousers!I came here to get some emergency pants and they helped me out.  Not only did I get two pair of pants but they were both on sale for half price!I was very excited about the whole thing.  Clearly, it doesn't take much to get me excited.
