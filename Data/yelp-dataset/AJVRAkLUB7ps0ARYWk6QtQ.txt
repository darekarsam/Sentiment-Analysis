5	I ducked into Joseph-Beth while I was biding time before a movie (and also to escape the heat). At first glance, I thought it was a regular Borders/Barnes & Noble type emporium, but after a quick glance, Joseph-Beth is far superior. 1. Caribou Coffee attached!2. A random, yet awesome amount of Burt's Bees products available. 2. Impressive magazine selection.3. The discount book table actually has good books worth buying, and not just bad romance novels or "50 Ways To Cook Cauliflower" or whatever. I got Diablo Cody's stripper memoir for six bucks!
5	Joseph-Beth is a true rarity these days: an independent bookstore the size of a B&N, with great service and a wonderfully local focus on Pittsburgh writers. They have the best literary magazine selection in the area (that I've found so far) and a door to the neighboring Caribou Coffee. My favorite sections here: the magazines, the poetry, the cookbooks, and the local books. They also have a wide selection of graphic novels, and offer a membership program for frequent shoppers (though I have yet to try this out).
