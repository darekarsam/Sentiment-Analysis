4	Best thing about this place is that it's so close to my house! Other than that they are well priced ($18 pedicure) and more or less I am always satisfied with the work. It is clean and net, massage chairs, TV, magazines ... you won't be bored. They had few new employees that did not impress me, but I still keep coming back. If you're in the area, I would recommend going!
5	By Far the best place for a pedicure in the valley!Small mom and pop shop and feel, very welcoming and they always have time for a walk in. They are so talented at designs on the nails it is awesome! and 20 bucks for a pedicure sounds pretty darn good to me. I am not from the area but alway make sure I stop when I am visiting Arizona and send everyone I know here. I advise you to give it a try because you just might find yourself to be a new regular
2	Went to this place while shopping for a new salon...in less than 2 weeks my brand new full set started falling apart ..2 nails totally lifted right off...that was after I told the girl I wanted them shorter her reply was "you'll get use to them being that long" then she started polishing them I told her the color wasn't me and I didn't want her to finish. ..her reply..." you'll get use to it too"....so I paid for something I did not like...their customer service sucks! ! don't waste your time or money....
5	I have been going here for many years, and every time I go it's a great personable experience. When you go to most salons there is always one person (nail tech) you prefer, but at this salon they're all amazing.
5	Very friendly staff, clean and inexpensive.  Did a great job on my pedicure.  Definitely coming back here again, the leg massage was amazing!
