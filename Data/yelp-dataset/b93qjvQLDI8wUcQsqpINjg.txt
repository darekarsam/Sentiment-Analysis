5	the food was all really good .i love that they cooked thier carne asada fresh not like filibertos
5	Loved the food, the prices, and the people! I was so sad to see they closed. When, after a couple of weeks, a banner went up saying, "Coming Soon" I jumped for joy that they were going to re-open. Alas, after a month or so of coming soon, that banner was gone as was the Floriberto's sign.They were similar to Filiberto's, but of superior quality, and the lady who took the orders and the man who cooked (the owners, I assume) were super-nice.Now, I need to find a good place for a machaca w/egg burrito. :(
5	Jam H if you read this, this is the son of the owners. My family and I want you and everyone else to know that Floriberto's is just taking a short break, but we will be back and we will have original, newer and better food in our big come back. We want thank you for being a proud fan Floriberto's Mexican Food
