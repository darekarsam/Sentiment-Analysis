3	Always have good experiences when I go. Pitas are nice and cheap, and full meals are a bit more pricey, but definitely tasty.
4	I love Middle Eastern food, and Basha is my favourite. The workers here are great. This is the one I always go to, even though I find this to be the second best Basha there is (with the first being the one on St. Catherine and Mansfield - right next to Sports Expert).
3	Great location downtown that is close to shopping and offices. If you want a quick lunch Basha has great fresh food at responsible prices.
