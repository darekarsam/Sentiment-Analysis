5	Best japanese restaurant in South Shore!!Always packed on the week end this restaurant is the place to go if you are looking for a good time and you want to party on the week-endIf you like a more quiet ambiance i would strongly suggest you to book during the week days.Never in my life i have been to a restaurant with such a good vibe. Everyone just seemed to be so happy and it's guarantee to have a good time ! When i went there i took a chateaubriand and shrimp. The shrimp was so good it litteraly melt in my mouth.The chateau was very moist and juicy.The meal came with :SoupSalade with that amazing sesame sauce! (I order a whole bottle for take out!!)Free shrimp appetizerMix of grill vegetableMore shrimp ChateaubriandFried rice Tea Ice CreamAt first it looks expensive but for what you actually get its really worth it.I would dare anyone to order the same food at another restaurant and try to compare it! Plus you get to have a really funny show from the chef! I hope this helped!CheersEric Van Nguyen
