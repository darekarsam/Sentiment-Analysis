1	If you are looking for evidence that Las Vegas has a soul, this isn't it. The art is vacuous and unchallenging, not even kitschy enough to be ironically good. Mostly just little cubicles of uninspired junk-- poorly executed nudes, "gothic art" -- not to be confused with outsider art (or something actually worth seeing), walls lined with flaccid still lifes and hand blown glass figures that appear to be from the indoor swapmeet. Apparently, this place was voted the best art gallery in Vegas by locals, which I suppose says a lot about the locals.
5	I went to get a appraisal. They asked if I had a appt. but I didnt. I am from out of state. Brett came out from the back and offered to help. That was very nice of him. I would call ahead and make a appt. before you go in. Thanks Brett for your help. Will for sure be back.
5	Simply the best customer service I have had! I was at the gallery in Caesars palace on a birthday trip to Las Vegas. My girlfriend and I stopped in to see Brett as we are huge pawn stars fans. Brett was not there but we were greeted by his father Rod. Rod saw it was my birthday from the birthday button my girlfriend made me wear lol. He proceeded to give us a complete tour of the gallery for over an hour taking the time to explain each piece and even brought special pieces out of the back to show us even though we were not really looking to buy.The time given by rod and the information given was so great, I returned the next day and bought a rare piece that was pointed out to me.. What a fantastic experience!
