2	Ordered for delivery about 6 months ago.  Food came after close to 2 hours.  It was cold when it came, and the driver was barely apologetic.  They were very unhelpful over the phone.  Food was mediocre, definitely not the best I've ever had, but also not the worst.  I was apprehensive because there have been claims of cockroaches in the food, but I had none.  I would definitely go with Cravings if you're in the area over Bobo China.
5	I like Bobo. They have really authentic Chinese food. Best on campus. Off campus is Tang Denisty. If you are not from south/southeast part of China, you will definitely agree with me.
3	Went there several times for buffet. They only have maybe 10 selections of fried dishes and some desserts that look old. Haven't tried anythin else there.
