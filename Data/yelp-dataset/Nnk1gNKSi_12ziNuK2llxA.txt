4	I have furnished 90 percent of my home with Arhaus items including a sectional sofa, chair and ottoman, accent tables, lamps, dining table and chairs, etc. The upholstered items are very comfortable but the furniture finishes are somewhat problematic. I have tried a variety of different furniture cleaners and polishes and cannot restore the surface without smudging and streaking. The sales staff members are very friendly and knowledgeable, I have dealt with 3 staff members over the past 5 years and have been pleased with their expertise and service.All in all, I am a satisfied customer. I recommend this company if you are looking for contemporary furniture with a traditional flair.
4	Arhaus sells beautiful, beefy, traditional furniture for an equally large ticket. This store is surprisingly large, and I loved that it displays such an extensive selection. After I'd been in the store at least 5 minutes, an eccentric associate greeted me. I definitely plan to return to the store in the future when I'm looking to refresh my super-comfortable family room sofa.
