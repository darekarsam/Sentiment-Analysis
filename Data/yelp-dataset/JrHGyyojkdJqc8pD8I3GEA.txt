5	This is a great PNC branch! Everyone is friendly, courteous, and knowledgeable about the services that they can offer.Ask for Maryanne. She's been with PNC for 35 years and is a real delight to work with.Every time I walk in this branch, I feel proud to be a PNC client!
3	A completely serviceable branch in Bloomfield. This is the closest branch to my house, however I generally seem to prefer other branches in the East End. The staff is generally very nice- I met with one of the consultants recently to discuss obtaining a PNC credit card. Sometimes the wait here is pretty long, but all of my experiences have been relatively good.
4	This is my branch and they are very friendly. There can be long waits in line, mostly because of business owners of Bloomfield I suspect. But with this kind of service it's worth the wait.
