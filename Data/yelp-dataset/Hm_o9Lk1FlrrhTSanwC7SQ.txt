5	Modern Formations is an art gallery and performance space located in the heart of Garfield.  Although it doesn't host as many shows as it used to, I've found that its concerts are among the most interesting in the city, typically attracting bands that have a strong avant-garde or performative dimension.  The space itself is very intimate--it can maybe hold 100 people or so--and it provides a great home for the local arts scene. If I still lived in the city, I would make a special point of stopping here for any gallery crawl, reading, or special event.
5	This is probably my favorite gallery stop on the Garfield stretch of Penn Ave. I've enjoyed many a music performance there, and the art selections are generally well curated. There's a consistent level of quality that you just don't find at most of the other galleries in the neighborhood. Plus, on Unblurred gallery crawl nights, they generally have the heaviest pours on free wine. And it's not even from a box! Huzzah!
