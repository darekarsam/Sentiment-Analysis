2	Nope
4	We have tried ask the items on the menu and have enjoyed them all! Sunday special is a sampler of several meats and a side, generous portions and great food.
5	Great food, good portions, love this place pulled pork was great wife had ribs even better you have to try this place out
3	Wasn't given the advertised price on the daily special.  Staff was friendly, food was bland and less then average.  Was the only patron in the building and my one to go order was missing a side I specifically asked for.   Location was nice but very small.  Ate there once before and really enjoyed the smoked potato salad with bacon.
5	Wholly s! $& that is some good bbq. The St. Louie Ribs  were ridiculous.  Add a cold draft beer and you CAN'T beat it. I wish I lived closer.
