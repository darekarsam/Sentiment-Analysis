1	Horrible service.  I walked in to an empty place and still no one greeted me, not the little boy behind the counter or the mgr who was sitting at a table and never looked up! The little boy just stared at me silently till I told him what I wanted, he made my food in silence, never asking if I wanted anything else.  He then kind of gently tossed the food to the area where you pay, and walked away, without a word! Then a girl asked up and asked me what I ordered, took my card and asked if I wanted a recpt, not another word was uttered, she didnt even ask if I wanted a bag. Then I left and ate the food that the cheese wasn't even melted on.
1	ONE STAR SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE IS NO LESSER OPTION.The blonde woman working the counter, unsure if she is the manager or just an associate, is the reason this store/location lost 2 more of it's customers today.Management should seriously evaluate their employees. I work customer service and am more than forgiving if someone is busy or unavailable but this place is a ghost town in there. The younger guy that ended up helping us was friendly enough, but first impressions were set when we walked in and got the greeting, or lack thereof.Do yourselves a favor and don't waste your time or money here. As far as upper management goes, do something about this immediately before this woman takes your store down.Terrible service! We won't be back.
4	The sandwiches I get from this location are always very tasty. I haven't ever had to throw my leftovers away because of a bad sandwich. However, I do not always have a good time dealing with the employees. Whenever I come in after 8pm, they are rude to me and act like I'm walking in one minute before they're closing. It has made for some very awkward experiences. Overall, I enjoy going to this Subway for lunch and I will definitely be back.
