3	"I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day." ~Frank SinatraNothing like a Frank Sinatra quote to start off my Thursday, along with a review of the Wine & Spirits store on Shiloh Street up on Mt. Washington!Last night on my way to my friend's apartment, I stopped here for a bottle of wine. Red wine to be exact. The store's a little small, but serves its purpose. The only downside was a lot of the shelves were empty, or they were out of my favorites. NOT always a bad thing, it got me to try a bottle of the Chateau St. Jean Cabernet which was awesome! It's in a good central location on Mt. Washington and always an easy stop on the way to dinner!
4	Decent wine selection for a neighborhood desolate of a lot of essential commodities. I'm on top of a mountain! Literally, a mountain. But yes. We found an affordable Chardonnay to squelter back in our hotel room. They're open to a reasonable time and have a wide variety of liquors as well. Cheers.
3	Great selection of Malbec from Argentina. Nice selections of the spirits i consume. Great rum selection, vodkas and wines. Crane Lake vineyards is actually Trader Joe's brand. Crane Lake Malbec is a nice bottle of wine for 6.99. I love a good bottle of wine for under 10 bucks.
