4	Do you cook with spices?Do you want to try something new and discover new flavors?Do you like fresh mixed blends?The magic of cooking with spices, can be found at SavvySpices.Dave and his wife are the owners.  Dave spent time with us going over the spices and blends.  There are small canisters that you can open and smell the freshness.The pricing was very reasonable.It is on Banksville Road a few doors down from Banksville Plaza.  Check it out and get some fresh spices.
5	As DJ mentioned - Dave and his wife showed me around and introduced me to some spices for my grilling experience this evening.I am very familiar with Penzey's.    I really like this place.   What sets it apart are the blend types they have.   They will also make a mix if I request it.  One item of note that sets them apart - They will provide you fresh herbs for your special meals.   These are not pre-package but will be assembled for you.Kudos to Savvy Spices.   It appears I will be cooking more since they are very convenient.
