3	Ok, the staff and the doctor we saw were very nice. The waiting experience was not so nice. Why? Because on Mondays, apparently, pediatric offices can be filled to the brim with broken little weekend warriors. The waiting room was so full it smelled like a boys' gym locker and was stuffy and overly warm. We waited two hours beyond our appointment time to be seen. Thank goodness as the room cleared out the temperature went down and the wait was more pleasant. It's a comfortable room with decent chairs. Kudos to whomever decorated the space. (The artwork in the office we were in was nice, too!) did I mention the nice staff there?
1	Very rude and unprofessional scheduling department for both locations. They canceled 3 appointments due to their inability for not knowing which doctor was covered by my insurance. Finally, one months later made appointment with right one. Hopefully doctor is better then the scheduling people.Will update my review after I see the doctor
