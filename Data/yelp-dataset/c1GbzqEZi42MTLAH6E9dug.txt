4	Nice Italian restaurant, great staff and a real nice atmosphere. As Brian said, they have no official kids menu, but are willing to make all of the portions smaller for children and a reduced price as well. Their pizzas are wonderfully made with some extremely good ingredients. We tried three of their pizzas there and they didn't miss a beat on any of them. The flavors of all of the ingredients really popped and the crust was nice and thin, with a little crunch but a lot of flavor. IF, and I mean IF there was a downside it was this... we sat outside (our choice), but by sitting outside it seemed like we were forgotten when it was time for the check (nothing major, it just took a few minutes longer than we thought it would). Will I go back? YES! The food was great, the staff was wonderful, and the atmosphere was nice. It will be a place that I return in the future.
4	This place is owned by Luigi (see Luigi's Pizza  http://www.yelp.com/biz/luigis-pizza-charlotte-3 ) and its a pretty cool place. The food was great, the service was excellent and the prices were fair. If you go be sure to have the specials since they are really fantastic.If you don't already know about Luigi's other locations - be sure to grab a Pizza at any of them since you have been missing out.
2	Pizza was bad!  very soggy, not cooked enough or too much cheese, more cheese does not make a better pizza.   There was tiny tiny bits of sausage so small we thought they forget them and some horrible marinaded green peppers on it.  Service, at bar, really bad.    Had the New England calm chowder once, that was good.  Too many little kids and babies for higher end Italian food.  Kids in bar area :(
