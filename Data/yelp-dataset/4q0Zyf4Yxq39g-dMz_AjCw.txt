1	Went in for my first prenatal visit and was disappointed. The nurse whom called me back into the room was rude and got annoyed that my sister and niece wanted to come back into the room w/ me, she rolled her eyes. Once in the room she asked routine questions w/ no enthusiasm whatsoever. I'm excited and blessed w/ my first baby! When I asked questions, the nurse would answer short responses w/ an attitude & assumed I should already know. Her body language made me feel like I was asking stupid questions. I'm a first time mom and have many questions which I should be able to ask comfortably and get genuine feedback on. The OB who came in to do my ultra sound automatically assumed Dad isn't a part of baby's life because he was not there (he was at work)! She then went onto judge who should and shouldn't be in the room w/ me during the ultra sound, even said it was weird that I had certain ppl in there. She made some of my family members uncomfortable and feel unwelcome. During my ultra sound she let us hear the baby's heart beat for literally 1 second and said we would be able to hear more next time. There will be NO next time!
5	I really love this office!! Have been going here for about 6 years now. The Dr and Np I saw was amazing and answered every question I had. The facility was clean, bright and welcoming. All of the staff at Estella women's were sweet and knowledgeable. Defiantly recommend this office to everyone!
5	If you're a woman, you know just how important it is to have a good va jay jay doctor. When I walked in, it was a pleasant environment, warm and welcoming. The front receptionist was also vey nice! Great customer service. When I went back for my exam the person who asks you all the questions before the doctor comes in was great in personality and made me feel comfortable. Finally the actual exam. No pain, felt secured and comfortable and loved the education and knowledge  I was given. I would highly recommend coming here!
