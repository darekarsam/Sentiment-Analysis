1	Rude!!I walked in and was ready and willing to make this my new tanning salon because there was no wait and it wasn't crowded like my usual spot is right after work. The guy at the front desk looked extremely uninterested and acted as if I was bothering him with my questions. Because it was my first time there I explained to him that I was looking to try this place out and wanted to know what kind of packages they offered, he pointed to a piece of paper taped to the counter and that was it (no help, no salesmanship). I asked if they had a copy of the paper for me to take home and look over, again he was rude and acted like I was inconveniencing him. He said he could print one out if I wanted, I told him I would like that and would get it after my session so he would have plenty of time to do that. After I laid in the mediocre bed for 15 minutes I walked out expecting to have the print out of package options. No such luck, the guy was on what seemed to be a personal phone call so I waited around the counter for about 2 minutes while I was completely ignored and finally walked out. I see now why there was not wait right after work.
4	I've been going here since they were in the old location up on East Blvd.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and their hours are convenient for me.
5	always friendly,,,, wait is minimal is at all,, and stop in at ryans also
1	Staff really doesn't care if you live or die !! They seem to not understand the concept of customer service and that less customers equals less money for the business . What a waste of a good location.
