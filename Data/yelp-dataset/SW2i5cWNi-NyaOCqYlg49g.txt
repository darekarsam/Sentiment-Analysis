5	I just had breakfast at the Lowesville Cafe and it was amazing!!!  It is under a new owner and they have redone the entire place.  It looks amazing inside and out.  The food was absolutely fresh and delicious!!  They cook everything from scratch and it was delivered to my place at the counter piping hot!!  The sweet tea was fantastic.  It's such a cool place!  Please plan your route to check out this great place!  It's perfectly rustic with an incredibly friendly staff full of Southern charm!  Do yourself a favor and do what I did...plan your day around a visit to the Lowesville Cafe!!
4	My friends and I had breakfast at this restaurant Sunday.  The exterior of the establishment is by no means an indicator of the quality of food or experience.   The omelette and potatoes were generous in portion and delicious.  Service was superb.  A good old home country feel.  Inexpensive too!
