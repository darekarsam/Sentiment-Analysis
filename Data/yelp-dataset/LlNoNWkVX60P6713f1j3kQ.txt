4	Sweet! I can now get my Barro's fix closer to home. I'm sure most of you already recognize this as THE best local pizza chain we've got in Phoenix, and the thick, flavorful crust as well as awesome toppings are delicious for lunch or dinner. Came here for a nice lunch special...two people dining in with two slices and a small drink each came out to just a bit under $10. That's less than you'll probably spend at any of the other options in this plaza. I'd tried the special "hot wing" variety with chicken and buffalo sauce and it was tasty! Just make sure the pre-made pizzas aren't getting too cold. Pizza should always be a hot lunch!There are also tons of seats here, and the place is VERY clean. I look forward to coming back. =)
4	This Barro's  location is brand new and after talking to the manager for a little, I think it will be around for a long time. The staff is motivated, friendly, and wanting to succeed. I had one of there many lunch specials, 2 pieces of pizza and a drink for $4! Hard to beat that deal anywhere. The pizza was fresh out of the oven, and were a decent size. Like all other Barro's they do have a salad bar with is included with some of their specials if you would rather have a fresh salad. I enjoyed it and will be there for lunch again.
5	Great place that my boyfriend and I like to go to. We always get the ravioli. Love the passion fruit tea. Can't wait to try the pizza!
5	Just like all the other ones.  Fast service, good food and no complaints.  Very clean.
