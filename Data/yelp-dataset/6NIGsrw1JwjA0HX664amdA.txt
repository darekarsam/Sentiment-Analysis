2	The service was great and the espresso laced whip cream was yummy but they failed to stock more food for us hungry travelers. No flat bread and she was unable to make cheese omlets. Plus, the quiche had pork. Bummer!
3	Came here after my flight to get some ice tea. First off if you are gonna me open 24/7 as they say then you should also have things in stock. They didn't have the iced green or black tea available. They made the hot green tea to pour it over ice, but didn't wait for it to brew. Now pretty much all I have is warm water. The only reason I even gave it any higher than 1 star is because the guy behind me decided to buy my drink.
1	I ordered the italian flat bread. It was super moist. (when it comes to flat bread, "moist" is an automatic fail of course).I also had a latte with almond syrope. Before this I don't remember the last time I had to throw a coffee away. Yes, it was that bad.
5	For an airport eatery, the price is not bad for their omelettes! I paid $8.50 and this omelette is humongous! Very happy customer!
