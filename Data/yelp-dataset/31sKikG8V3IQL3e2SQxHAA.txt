2	So it was a lazy day in the household and we weren't feeling up for going anywhere or cooking anything. We grabbed the trusty "Top Menu" and voted on Dunns for delivery. NEVER AGAIN.We ordered the Dunn's Pizza (the one with smoked meat, green peppers, onions, etc). Well, what can I say? The dough was so thin you could see through it. The toppings wouldn't stay on the pizza an its not because there were SOOO many toppings but rather the dough was thin. How do I know? I took all the toppings off one slice of pizza and held it up, I could SEE THROUGH it!!!! Next time I'll stick with Dominos.
5	Great service , great food !I went with my family and found every one of our meals delicious .The best smoked meat I've ever had, ever!
5	Contrary to Jenny's review I think this place has the best pizza ever. I had it on 3 separate occasions. It is thin but oh so delicious. I can not speak for the smoked meat pizza as I have not tried it. Pepperoni, all dressed or vegetarian = awesome. I could eat the whole thing by myself it's so good :)
