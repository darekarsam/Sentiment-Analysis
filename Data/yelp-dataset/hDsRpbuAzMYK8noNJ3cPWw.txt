1	This the worse lab and office staff , you wait hrs for them to take you back . My tax money go for lab crop to bump firemen to be the front . The office staff are very rude . Don't go there
1	Worst place in the world, unless you want to wait an hour for a witch to draw your blood then go here.
5	I handed them my poop and they took it,  what else can I say.  Specimen drop off is very easy.  You sign in,  they ask for insurance card and then you hand them your labeled specimen.
5	Maryanne was amazing at labcorp !! I let her know that im deathly afraid of needles and that I pass out when my blood is getting drawn so she put me at ease quickly. She recommended to lay down and it will be quick and painless which was all true! ! Thank you maryanne
