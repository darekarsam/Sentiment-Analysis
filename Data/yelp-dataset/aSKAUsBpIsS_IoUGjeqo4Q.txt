5	Excellent service and pricing! I highly recommend Dembois!!
5	We've been using this company for the past couple years and they've always done a great job.  They're easy to communicate with and always fulfill our requests.
1	This company worked at my house for around one year, after which time, I was no longer satisfied with the deteriorating service and let them go.. 3 years later I discovered that they reported me to a collections agency over a $160 bill that they claim was never paid. They gave me no notification of a past due amount or that they were reporting it to collections even thought they had worked at my house for over a year and clearly knew my address. This is a poor way for any business to treat its customers and recommend anyone thinking of using them to proceed with caution. If I could leave a zero I absolutely would.
