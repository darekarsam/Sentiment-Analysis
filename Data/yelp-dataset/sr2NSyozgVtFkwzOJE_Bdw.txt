5	Amazing Levantine/Lebanese cuisine, a clear cut above the plethora of Shish Taouk places in Montreal. La Sirene specializes in fish, fresh catch is brought in everyday, but their sujok (sausage) is quality... probably the best I've had outside the Middle East. For the meat lover, I'd recommend the mixed grill. The restaurant is on the expensive side but portions are hearty and the mezza is to die for. For those who would like an authentic Levantine meal Arak is on hand, definitely a plus.
5	Incredible - it's a Lebonese restaurant so you can also get traditional Lebanese food there - which is also exceptional - but the place is known for the fish. They have a market attached with a huge selection of fresh fish. I had the swordfish and my wife had the machawa - both meals were out of this world! I would eat there every night if I could - the fatoush was amazing but again every dish was authentic and incredible - as for pricing, it was a real bargin considering the quality of food and service. My wife (who is Lebonese) said it was amazing and exactly as it should be - authentic and superior - a very special place!Worth the drive if you're in downtown - and don't let the neighborhood throw you -this place truly is five stars! We won't be able to stop raving about this place for a long time - incredilble!!!!
4	You would think you have died and gone to lebanese seafood heaven; excellent selection of some of the yummiest lebanese food, great service and environment for a gathering.
5	This is coming from someone with a Lebanese background, this is hands down one of my favourite Lebanese restaurants (outside of Lebanon lol)! A bit pricey but definitely worth it! Staff are super nice, food is super amazing!I HIGHLY recommend this place
