5	Lena has been my nail technician for over 5 years. I get compliments all the time on my nails. They never lift  and I  am rather tough on my nails being a bartender. Brian her husband does a great pedicure with a thorough foot massage that really takes the ache out of my bartender feet!  I can attest they are good at what they do. I'm not sure who the other reviewer went to in their shop as my experience with this shop couldn't be more different sp it must've been someone else. There are good and bad in every business the people I deal with are GOOD!
4	Looks can be deceiving! This was the best manicure and pedicure I have ever had. Walking in I was a little nervous by the look of the place.... But the professionalism and the quality of service was way above par.
5	The best manicure and pedicure by Lena. Brian does my husbands pedicure. When inLas Vegas we make it a priority to come here. Nice people and great quality!
5	This nail salon is the best. I live in Sydney Australia most of the year but when I come  in to town for business and to visit my aunt I always get my nails done and  have a pedicure at this salon. They do a great job! I've had my nails done at a lot  of places in the USA and in Sydney and I would have to say they have given me the best pedicures and acrylic nail fills I have ever  had! My acrylic nails always last for four weeks after being at their salon and the pedicure lasts forever. I am so glad I stumbled across this place a couple of years ago. Looks are definitely deceiving. Their prices are so reasonable and their work is fantastic!
