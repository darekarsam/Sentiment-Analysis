5	Great service, beautiful building! So grateful to have a subway in Vistancia!
1	Horrible!! Went there Sunday at noon and only 1 employee was working!  Also,  out of numerous things.  This place is managed very poorly!
1	Agree with Bryan A.  This place needs a manager.  Sad.  Two young teenagers left there working alone.  The guy seemed to know what he was doing, however the gal working with him was totally useless.  She didn't know the menu, didn't know how to make a sub (BLT) and clearly didn't know how to use the cash register.  And one large fly buzzing around the meat and cheese station.  Ugh.  I'm done.
