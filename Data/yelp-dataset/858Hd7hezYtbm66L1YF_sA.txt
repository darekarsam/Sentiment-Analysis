5	I was brought into this salon through their coupon, "$9.99 Haircut". Hard economic times, yep, I'm goin! Salon is plain ans straight to the point but cute and nicely decorated. They have 2 massage chairs up at the front that you can utilize while you wait to be taken care of or while you're waiting for your hair color to set in. My stylist was Malisa. She's a very sweet gal, chit-chat here and there and-- I have one requirement of any stylist that I go to, THAT THEY LISTEN TO WHAT I WANT and not do what they "think" I should do. YES, she did and she is awesome! I went in for a cut, color and blow-dry. I was very skeptical because, c'mon, coupon?? LOL But I was very satisfied with the end result.
4	I stopped by here because they were the closest to the house and all I need is a crappy military hair cut. It seems as if most people off base don't know how to do military  styled hair cuts but I told her just a fade and take some off the top and she did it quick and good. I can say my hair took maybe 5 mins. The cut was $11.99 so it's fairly cheap and I didn't wait to long to get on the chair. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that when I came in they asked me to sign in and then left me alone without saying anything else. Normally you would be informed about how long you might wait and how many people are ahead of you but they said nothing which if I were in any sort of hurry, that would be a deal breaker.I wish I could remember the lady's name who cut my hair but she was the only one in there at the moment so she's probably the main stylist. (she's a cute asain-ish looking girl) well she did a good job so if you just need a quick guys cut I'm sure she'll do a good enough job.
1	Open till 7pm but won't take walk in for basic men's cut at 525pm. Terrible business.
