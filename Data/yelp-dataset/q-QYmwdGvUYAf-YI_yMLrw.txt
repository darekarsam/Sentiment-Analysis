1	Mahendra Kumar Trivedi has been involved in no less than 11 lawsuits since 2011.All are in the public record in California. Arizona. Pennsylvania. Minnesota. He hasn't won a single case while attempting to use the U.S. Judicial system to smother outspoken critics of his practice, his claims, and his personal behavior, specifically his reported degradation of women.In an Order handed down today-- December 3 2014 by Judge Brann, US District Court of PA, Mahendra Trivedi's defamation lawsuit against the Penn State scientist, Tania Slawecki, whose research discredited his claims, was dismissed.A major defeat for Trivedi and his whole disingenuous organization.And a major victory for the TRUTH.
1	This guy is not a nice guy. He had a workshop at our church and 5 mins in, he yelled at his staff in front of everyone. Then I paid serious $ to get a private energy healing and the guy took calls and texts. I mean, who does that?  There is chatter about sexual abuse and some lawsuits. It's too bad, because I really want him to be who he says he is.  He wouldn't last 2 mins in India. Plus, they would never pay what he is serving up! I think he needs someone to send him some good energy.
