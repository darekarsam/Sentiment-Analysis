1	My fiance and I came in with 5 minutes to closing, there was an emloyee about 6' with blonde hair and tattoos, granted they were about to close , this dude was a dick. Pressuring us to buy this game or that game just so he could close on time. (Pressuring not suggesting) I had to leave before we checked out because I was so ticked off. He was pushy and inconsiderate. I've been going here for years, but because of this guy I wont be going back.
