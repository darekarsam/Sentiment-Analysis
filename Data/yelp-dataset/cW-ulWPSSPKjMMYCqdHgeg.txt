5	This chinese joint is excellent, I must say! They are quick, friendly, and the food is delicious! I recommend this to every person who loves chinese food! Take out only i believe... Try the broccoli&beef!
4	The service is fast and friendly. Good size portions. Each time i have had their food i have enjoyed everything. Its not the best Chinese food if all time, but its good food for a good price.
5	I have always enjoyed the Dragon restaurant. The lady up front is very friendly and attentive and the food is delicious. Shrimp with Garlic sauce is my favorite.
4	Very fast and friendly service.  This is definately a no-frills place and there is nowhere to sit down and eat in the restaurant, BUT it is a great place for take-out!  The woman/cashier I deal with every time I go up there always seem to know instinctively what my order is and she is always very nice and accommodating.  The food portions are LARGE and everything is always very GOOD.
4	I've been coming here for years. Nice place for take out they do not have no dine in restaurant area but good prices and decent quality food. The girl who runs the register is super nice and friendly she always knows what I want too :)
