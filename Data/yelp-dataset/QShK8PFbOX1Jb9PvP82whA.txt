4	Yum! I live in San Francisco so I know from good Japanese food, and I try to make Mikado a stop whenever I'm back home.Last time I was in town, I took my folks. Dad had a Chicken Katsu that would have had him licking the platter if it hadn't been so hot. Mom and I sampled some of the ngiri & sashimi, and didn't find one clunker in the bunch.  Their use of green apple in the maki was new to me (I generally eat only at traditional Japanese restaurants) but was lovely.  I always make a point of trying rolls I haven't had before when I can, and Mikado always has a selection of new ones, including ones that the kosher among us can eat. (Most places' rolls are all eel and crab, so MIkado's wide variety of rolls that are fish, fruit, vegetable and tasty sauces are a pleasure and delight.)I've heard mutterings elsewhere about Mikado being "expensive." Cheap, they aren't. But expensive is relative, and I've had Japanese food that cost a lot more and tasted a lot worse. But we're talking about RAW FISH. You get what you pay for - do you want a well-kept restaurant where the food is excellent and you know you'll walk out healthy, or not?My one complaint is that they have to be a tad more careful with the miso soup. They serve two varieties, one of which has shellfish in it. That's not the one we ordered - guess which we got?
5	Yummy!
4	Split the dumplings as a starter,  ok, but I have had better.   Had the Seafood, Udon Noodles, Teryaki dish which was good,  although teryaki is not my favorite type of preparation.  Partner had Steak Teriyaki which was excellent.   Next time I will try the Tempura dishes.Service was excellent,  very attentive.
