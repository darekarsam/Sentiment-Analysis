5	If you have a mustang (or other classic) this is the place to come. The guys in the back have been doing this for 20+ years and know what they're doing. For the people that said it takes a long time to get their car back, you should take your car to the regular corner shop down the street. If you want what's under your hood to actually look good, it's going to take longer than Joe Schmoe's auto repair.
1	John sold me a transmission with a year warranty and it broke and he told me I broke it so it wasn't under warranty..... What the hell is a warranty for exactly?? If it breaks it's fixed by the shop.. I had to haggle for a day just to get him to cover half the cost.. Beware a warranty at the mustang shop is not a warranty. Oh yea and he sold me a 5.0 engine that had the lowest compression that I've ever seen and almost didn't take it back. 40psi was the highest measurement I got on cylinder 2.if you want good mustang parts go else ware!
2	Not recommended. I had work done on my 69 fastback several times by The Mustang Shop. First of all, each time, the repairs took weeks longer than I was told they would take. I was talked into replacing the air conditioning with a modern system. John told me it would blow "ice cold". It did not blow ice cold and was ineffective on hot days. I asked if they had a bezel to accommodate a CD player. I let myself get talked into having them install my new stereo. Bad move. Poor, ugly work. Several other instances - work always took longer than promised.
