5	Awesome service and professional barbers that are service minded.  Haircut for the whole family.  Eli is the owner and he is a down to earth guy that is always in a good mood and offers great consistent service.    Call ahead if you like but not necessary.   All barbers are super awesome and professional.  Definitely recommend this place.  Check out the pictures
5	Very talented Barbers! While I was there all customers left very happy with their cuts. Defenitely recommending this place to friends and family!!
5	Good barber, friendly service, clean shop. Costs a couple of dollars more than the chains, but worth it for the quality and straight edge blade finish. I was also happy they take American Express and all cards through Square.
