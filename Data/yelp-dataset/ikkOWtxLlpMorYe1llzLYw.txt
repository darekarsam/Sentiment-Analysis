3	Dalkeith Road is so sad-looking. I don't know how a street can looks sad, but it does. It's sort of saying 'I'm out of the way, I'm long and there are other roads parallel to me that are much better and get there quicker. sigh.' Is it possible to feel sorry for a road? AnywayC's Tasty Bites thus lacks the va va voom I look for in a snack shop. It tries, nonetheless, and 10/10 for effort. The place itself is small, I think too small to breathe so only ever come here for take-away. The price is alright and the food isn't amazing, but maybe i;m lacking enthusiasm because when I leave i'm left with Dalkeith road. aw.
