5	Stopped here spur of the moment, glad I did.It was a Monday night around 7, the bar was pretty full and about half of the tables were, also. Nice, Clean place. It was Yuengs and Wings Night. Buy a Yuengling for $1.35 and get a pound of wings for free. Hard to beat. I had 2 Yuengs, one order of free wings and an order of Potato Skins. Total $5.69, hahaha. The wings were really good, one piece(fiddler and drum connected). Mild was hot and spicy. A guy at the bar recommended Hot Cajun, hmmm, maybe mild cajun, hehe. I'm definitely going back. A sign noted that after 5 on Thursdays it's AYCE Wings for $3.95.
5	Awesome Fish Sandwich Best in Pittsburgh go for the beer battered ENJOY!!!!
