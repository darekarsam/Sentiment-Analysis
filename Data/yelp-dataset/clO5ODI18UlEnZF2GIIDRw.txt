1	Whack. Go to Marquee instead at the Cosmo. Music sucks, people are super ghetto. Did not feel like I was in Vegas at all :( Waste of money.
1	Not worth the time - was offered VIP access by a promoter on a Saturday night that the wrist bands I got would get me in for free and open bar till midnight ...got to the door and the hostess tells me its 30 bucks to get in instead of 40 but it was still open bar ...took a chance and got inside - this place is small ...more like a bar trying to be a lounge ...and small...I couldn't believe i saw people actually falling for what was VIP type seating next to the dance floor ...probably paid waaaay too much for it as well Free drinks were well drinks - horrible cheap vodka - i stuck to the cheap rum, no beer offerings in the open bar - midnight hit and I see people turning in drink tickets but was told the ones I had were able to be redeemed after midnight ...really...so the people next to me got the hall pass but not me o_OPeople in there were very much out-of-towners, bit of an older crowd with no knowledge of where to go for a Vegas night out...DJ was average at best-really got the impression it was amateur hour when i was in there ...didnt stick around to waste money on drinks and left not much past midnight for something else
