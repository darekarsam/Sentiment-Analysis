5	We recently bought a foreclosure that had some serious issues with the paint, and stucco on the exterior of the home. Leo at A&T came out to give us a free estimate same day we called. He was about half the price of some of the other estimates we received, and had references with several photos of his past work so my wife, and I felt very comfortable.Leo gave us a price, and a time line of how long it would take. We have a large 2 story home, and he replaced the stucco with a sand finish, and repainted the entire house in 4 days. They were very professional, and the job looked better than we could have imagined. They came early, stayed late, and had the job done in the time frame that was quoted. He has 15 years experiance, and it shows!If you need any service done to the exterior of your home I would recommend talking to Leo at A&T Remodeling. Very reasonably priced, and the work is fantastic!!!
5	We can't say enough good things about Leo Valdez and A&T Remodeling. After a long run in of bad contractors we were timid to start another project. My husband called Leo and he came out right away, gave us a very reasonable estimate for stucco-ing our entire house, and a deadline of when he would be done. To our happy surprise he started when he said he would, and finished ON TIME; three days to do our home! He didn't ask us for more and more money as the job progressed like some contractors do, and when he was finished the stucco was beautiful! It was so crisp and clean and perfect. Leo is a perfectionist which is just what you want in a home remodel. When he and his crew were finished they even cleaned up! We are very very happy with Leo and A&T Remodeling. We've already referred him to our friend and will be using him again this weekend.
