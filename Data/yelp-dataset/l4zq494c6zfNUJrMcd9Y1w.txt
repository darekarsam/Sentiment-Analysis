5	I just moved in the neighborhood and don't have my laundry room set up yet. I went here to wash my bed sheets and it was a pretty typical laundromat. The woman working was very friendly and helpful (telling me the best machines to use for what I was doing)
4	Pretty good laundromat, though not without it's...quirks.Since my apartment doesn't have a laundry room, this is the closest laundromat for me to wash my clothes.  What I like about this place is that it's bright, pretty clean, and the attendant is very friendly.  If you go at a good time (weekday evening or early morning on weekends) it's also pretty empty -- which I like.  They also have a little sitting area to hang out in, rather than having to lean against your washing machine.The downside is that it's more expensive than other laundromats I've been to, and the dryers are pretty tricky (some take forever to dry your clothes, some run too hot, sometimes make your clothes smell like gas... not sure about that last one) so that part is a bit of a guessing game.Overall, the positives outweigh the negatives.  Any laundromat you go to is going to have some inconveniences, but this is by far one of the nicer ones I've used.
5	I use their wash and fold service. I drop my laundry off Monday morning before work, and pick it up after work in the evening. They only charge $1.20 per pound, and I get everything back washed, dryed and folded. I've been going for awhile and nothing has ever been damaged or lost. It's super convenient, affordable, and I imagine it's what having a housewife would be like. Love this place!
