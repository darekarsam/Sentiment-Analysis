4	The service dept is excellent... Too bad my car was not.
2	We did not have a good experience there.  Contrary to what the Saturn company is supposed to stand for, the salesman we worked with was extremely pushy (even for a used car salesman).  We won't go back.
3	I wasn't thrilled with the service I received when I took my Saturn L200 in. This was the second time I have taken it in and have been underwhelmed with their customer service skills. I was especially not thrilled when I was told it would cost over $700 to repair. I thanked them and said I didn't need to have it fixed afterall, and took it to another place in Urbana. It cost $209 to repair - and THAT guy got a NICE tip from me!
