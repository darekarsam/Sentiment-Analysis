4	Popped in here at the weekend for a tea ceremony and it was a very interesting and enjoyable experience. The range of teas on offer is formidable but there's definitely something for all tastes.Of the ones I sampled my personal favourite was the Red Robe Oolong. Nicely decorated and with the charming owner in attendance this is a specialist shop that deserves to prosper.I think the tea ceremonies are only being undertaken at weekends currently so probably best to call and book in advance. The shop also has a Facebook page.
