4	Newington is certainly not short of hairdressers.  There are a number of salons, particularly along the main thoroughfare of South Clerk Street / Clerk Street / Nicholson Street.  There are a few barbers dotted around, and Bailey's Barber Shop is, in my opinion, a cut above the rest.I first discovered Bailey's in the first year of my degree, while I was living in the Newington area of town.  They quickly established themselves as my barber of choice.  There was rarely a wait for a haircut, and I often went by on my way into lectures.  The barbers themselves were chatty, and always gave me the haircut that I wanted.  This, combined with the ideal location, meant that I continued to come back here for the first couple of years of my degree before I moved to the other side of town.Prices are reasonable, with a student discount available.  For someone like me, whose hair grows at a fair rate, using a salon would not be cost-effective.  Bailey's Barber Shop provided me with a great haircut each time, and I would highly recommend them.

The answer to permanent bed-head came after noticing one of my peers was rocking a great new cut. I followed him down the street to Bailey's and felt a bit more comfortable once I saw the great prices (ask for the student discount!) and the caged bird singing away. The barber was mostly quiet, a trait I look for, but did fast and excellent work. If you are unsure of where to get a haircut, look no further.
