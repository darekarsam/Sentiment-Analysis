3	Buy Cigars, Cigarettes, Tobacco, Pipes, Water Pipes, Hookahs, Accessories, and more at our Las Vegas location. Enjoy your first cup of coffee on us. YES free coffee on them yay!!!!!Little Havana Cafe
5	A real, cool smoke shop that offers cigars, cigarettes, bongs, peace pipes, hookahs, wraps, lighters, snacks, and more, all topped off with good service. They have a little hangout area towards the back of the shop where you can hang out to relax or smoke and watch tv. Shop is very clean. The cafe is no longer but there is something in the works that will replace it.
5	Tucked away in the Smiths shopping center is this wonderful cigar oasis. What may appear as a standard smoke shop, now offers a wonderful cigar lounge in the rear. Cigars are priced well below area averages and the management can't do enough to accommodate its customers. 3 high def tv's and a soon to open coffee bar really round this place out. Plenty of seating and a great group of guys make this a great destination to smoke!
5	This is a really good little shop for cigars at reasonable prices, the very best I have found in Las Vegas. I found cigars for $5 for 2 that were perfectly good, morning smokes. Mild and somewhat flavorful. They also have a good sized lounge and what appears to be a regular clientele.They also comped me a cutter and took good care of me in general. I like this place!
5	This place is as awesome as it gets, relax chairs, sports on and CIGARS.  Great cigars, great talking with MEN!  Real Men, that love cigars.   Booze coming soon, but bring your own....its fun!   Go!  Only if you love cigars!
5	One of the best cigar shops I've been to!  Great selection and great prices. They also have a lot of cigar accessories. This is not a head shop or vape shop with a few cigars.
