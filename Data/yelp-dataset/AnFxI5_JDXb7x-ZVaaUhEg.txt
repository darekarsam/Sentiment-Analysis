4	This is a good supermarket with almost anything, it opens at 8AM, closes at midnight...except for the mid-age woman  cashier who works in the morning at the fast checkout  this place is really good. She seems to have some level of mental retardation, she knows that customers with more than 6 items must go to the other checkouts, but she doesn't give a hoot and takes customers with full carts, while someone with one or two items must wait forever, it happens all the time...or she engages in long personal conversations with customers while the line builds up...not to mention her dismissive attitude towards us, the ones who shop at the store and somehow pay for her salary. If you can avoid this woman you'll be fine.
1	First impressions are everything, and the lady that checked me out today at about 1:30 PM was an absolute "b-word". I will be moving to Montreal in a month and considered going here to do my regular shopping, but I will not go here now. Would rather spend more money than listen to a sour attitude from a 50-something check-out woman with the attitude of a grumpy old lady! And while I am not a French speaker, she only spoke French to me, yet spoke English to the three customers in front of me. I don't mind trying to speak French, but when you speak English to the first three customers and basically say "piss off" to me, it makes me seem like she had an issue with me personally. Yep, only time going to this place. That is unfortunate, actually, as I did like the store.
