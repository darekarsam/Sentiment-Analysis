2	High hopes. Fading fast.Small, more community style bank.  I had a good experience mostly, but they have been inconsistent between me and another new customer.  Different answers, delivery dates, and I still have not received my referral credit.
5	I really like this bank, the staff is friendly and always take care of what I need.  I hate talking through the glass with bank tellers, and that is never a problem here. The design is nice and when I walk in its easy to relax, and then everyone is nice and they smile.  This is the best banking experience I have had.  We now have our personal and business accounts with Midfirst bank.
5	How can you not give this bank a 5-star?  It opens on Sunday, most banks don't.  It extend their business hours Mondays thru Fridays, most banks don't.  It gives you unlimited uses of other banks' ATM and reimburse you with the fees, again, most banks don't give you that options at all, unless you have a lot of money in their bank and they maybe will give you 1 to 2 times free monthly.  Seriously, do try them first before you give a bad review.
