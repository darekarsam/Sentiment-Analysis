1	On Monday June 9, 2014 I had a computer printed prescription filled at your pharmacy. (I had been getting all of my prescriptions filled there as I suffer from Fibromyalgia and I am also a chronic asthmatic haven been intubated 7 times.) Haven taken the prescriptions daily for 5 days I decided to Google the medications because I was having a hard time focusing and was feeling drugged, sleepy and very depressed I had never experienced that before while taking antibiotics.To my shock I found that instead of giving me Levoflazacin I was given levetiracetam an  anti-seizure, anti epileptic medication. Of course I phoned the pharmacy and they found they had made an error and then had me come in to get the correct medication. BUT, that was a very dangerous error. I also phoned my doctor and explained your error and was told that because of the high dosage 750mg I must be weaned off because to just stop could now cause me to seizure.Your pharmacist did give me a half hearted apology but because of his nonchalant attitude it leads me to think he found it no big thing and maybe they make these kind of errors frequently. As I said this script was computer printed so not being able to read it was impossible ... this was just incompetence.
5	I will go out of my way for this walgreens.  Besides friendly and clean this lication has a great set up.  The clinic is clean and staff is amazing.   I will switch from minute clinic to here.  They cover so much.
1	One of the WORST pharmacies ever!  I live near here (for many years) and have used them ONLY because of the location.  I am now moving ALL my prescriptions elsewhere.... EVERY SINGLE TIME I go to refill a med I have been on since 1999 IT IS NOTHING BUT A MAJOR HASSLE !   They can't seem to co-ordinate their phone system with their email system etc.  I only recently found out that THEY USE A CALL CENTER WHICH IS A HUGE PART OF THE PROBLEM !   Last time I went to refill they kept trying to blame my Dr.s office and when I called my Dr. they have this same issue with Walgreens ALL THE TIME !   I AM SO SICK OF DEALING WITH THEM THERE I AM MOVING EVERYTHING TO THE CLOSEST CVS to me.  I called CVS to see if they use a 'call center' for their scripts and they DO NOT.   I HATE THIS WALGREENS,   AND  there is a pharmacy tech there who has a REALLY BAD ATTITUDE all the time!   When you call this store you don't realize that you are actually NOT talking to the store... but to a call center nowhere near your store that you THOUGHT you were talking to !!!   INCOMPETENCE AT ITS FINEST IN MY OPINION which is based on 13 years of history with them !
