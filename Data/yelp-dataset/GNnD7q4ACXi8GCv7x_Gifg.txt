4	Nice and new! So far this McDonalds is off to a great start! No complaints! I will have to come back soon for another visit to see if they are keeping up the good work.
1	So I just felt like some fries nice golden crunchy fries and soft on the inside, I went through the drive thru ended up waiting for 5 minutes for my large fries. The worst part of it all, was that my fries were like bottom of the bag and lukewarm, it was terrible. I will next time I want fries I will grab potatoes and make them myself.
1	Has 2 drive thru but still slow on occasion.  I don't eat the food but when I go to one of these places for coffee I expect it quickly.  Last time I went they didn't even have large cups so the gave me a small and a medium.  I don't even drink a whole large coffee it just seems like they hold their heat a little longer.
1	Been there 3 times and service is horrible, there so slow..................................
4	Nothing to complain about here.  Quick service and the order was correct. A typical McDonalds and it was fairly clean.
4	This is probably the second best mcdonalds I've been in, first is the fancy one at the Biltmore.  It's new so you don't have the facilities issues others have, the staff is very friendly and I've never had to wait long for any order.  If you come during peak rush hours it may be different but that's on you.Only complaint is that it's still a mcdonalds, it's convenient not good and the sodium levels are nuts.
5	I usually skip the drive thru and go inside. Today a young lady named Aziona greeted me with one of the nicest smiles I've ever seen, she was awesome!
1	Slowest McDonalds I ever been to, to be honest. No matter what time of the day, busy or not. Takes 15 minutes for 2 mcdoubles and the workers always seem to he doing something else at the weirdest time no matter when I come. The late morning is fast but any other time, expect to wait.
