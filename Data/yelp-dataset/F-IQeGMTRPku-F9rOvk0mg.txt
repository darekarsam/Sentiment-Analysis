5	Great venue for dance, live music,theatre , storytelling,and shows especially for children. Art gallery focused on works by local artists and photographers,library half has larger selection of French books as opposed to English,but this is afterall,predominantly a Francophone neighbourhood. Glad I had the chance to catch this last performance before the holidays,glad to come back to one of my fave maisons de la culture.
4	I've experienced some great visual and performance art here! This past Sunday, I attended a show of traditional Ottoman empire music, performed live by some amazingly talented musicians, and it was FREE! Just phenomenal. I've also wandered in randomly and caught some excellent art exhibits in the main gallery (ground floor). Also, free entry to the gallery. I've not been into the library yet, but it seems cozy, well-stocked and spans a couple of floors. Maybe the next time I need a quiet, contemplative escape. Stop in and see what happens - dare you.
