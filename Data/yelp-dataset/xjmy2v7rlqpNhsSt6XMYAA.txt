3	I took both my boys to get their hair cut. The lady that cut his hair seemed to be having a bad day or just hated life. Either way, she did ok and this place is cheap. Works for me. I can't really expect too much.
5	Charity has been cutting my short classic pixie cut for over three years now.  I am happy with the affordable prices.
