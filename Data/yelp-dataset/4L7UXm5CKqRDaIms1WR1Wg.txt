5	Campbell"s Steam Pro is amazing! Their work is phenomenal. I was so surprised and impressed with how well they cleaned my carpets. I've had the carpets clean before by a "eco friendly company" and I wasn't impressed. Campbell's Steam Pro blows the green team out of the water. They have reasonable rates without the hassle.  They are professional, reasonable and accommodating. These guys know what they are taking about and know how to take care of it. Thanks Campbell Steam Pro!!!!!!!!!   : D
1	Called them up snd he was to busy to talk, said he would call back and never did.... I have alot of carpeting and need to stretch some area, they're loss.
1	Do NOT use this company! The owner is horribly rude, and hung up on me after I called to ask about the terrible job that was done to my house. Horrible customer service! I can't believe people like this are allowed to run a company.I uploaded a video on what our personal shampoo vacuum from costco pulled up from the carpet AFTER the poor job that Campbell's Steam Pro did to my carpets! http://youtu.be/8FkRqZcge7M
