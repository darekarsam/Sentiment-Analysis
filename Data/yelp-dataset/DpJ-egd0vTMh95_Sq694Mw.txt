3	Two kinds of vegan burgers ($7 each, though you can add cow's cheese) and a few salads and odds and ends.  The patties are good: the old school kind that does not pretend to be meat.  I didnt like the rye buns much, a little dry and bitter for my taste.  Staff is super friendly, and they can answer any questions.They take credit cards and can email you the receipt.  Livin in the future.
5	I really like veggie burgers that aren't supposed to taste like meat. While wandering around Madison looking about the touted food trucks for a good lunch spot, I never imagined I would stop at a veggie burger place, but stop I did.One think to mention is that the staff are extremely friendly and engaging. They discussed the different types of "burgers" with me after noticing it was my first time there.I can't remember the kind of burger I got anymore, but I had it topped with a local goat cheese slice that was really delicious. Another great thing about Igo Vego is that they have sugar-free drinks, which many "natural" food places do not!
4	I had a great experience today at the cart.  As mentioned before the staff were friendly, engaging and helpful.  I had one of the burgers on brown rice with a great avocado sauce.  It was a substantial portion for $7.  I added the optional vegan parmesan cheese and olive oil to the brown rice which dressed it up just enough for me.  I will definitely return to try the chili.
