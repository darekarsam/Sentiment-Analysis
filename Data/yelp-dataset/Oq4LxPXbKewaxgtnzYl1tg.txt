4	So, imagine Subway. Only the meat is so fresh they cut it for you right there with a grocery-store type slicing machine. There is a variety of sandwiches, you can get it grilled for free, and they have cut down toppings to the ones that make sense. Add a little of their special sauce and away you go.Make no mistake, there is nothing outlandish about these subs. But at $5-7, it's really good and has totally obliterated any reason for me to go to a Subway or Quizno's ever again.
4	I'm a big fan of Dagwoods. It's like the watered down and budget version of Subway. You get just as much as toppings as Subway and have your meat toppings sliced in front of you which is pretty cool. I like the prices at Dagwoods and everything on the menu seems under 5 bucks for a 6 inch sub. This place would be perfect for students or people with low income. Soups and Chilis are also offered at Dagwoods which I like. The trio combo at Dagwoods are cheap also. Overall, I like Dagwoods.
2	This is actually a review of Dagwoods' Laval location but I imagine they're quite similar. It was eerily like Subway but fewer choices of toppings. They did slice the cheese which is a plus but not enough to offset the mediocre taste. It was serviceable for getting a sandwich to go but definitely would not stop there again.
