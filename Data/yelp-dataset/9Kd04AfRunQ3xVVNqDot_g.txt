1	Tan Factory has terrible/no customer service.  When trying to get an issue resolved girls who work there say "I can't help you and my manager isn't here"  When you ask where the manager is they say "he's off, he'll be in Monday."  I played phone tag with a manager for over two weeks.  When I finally talked to him to resolve my issue he was not helpful and rude.  He told me he had to call corporate accounting to assist me.  He called back and informed me that he couldn't get ahold of accounting so he'd just go ahead and refund.  If he had the ability to refund me initially, WHY DIDN'T HE JUST SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  Beds are decent, but you could find somewhere with the same quality beds and better service easily.  Terrible. Awful. Don't go here.
4	yay! love this place. ive been coming here for years. its always very clean & pleasant employees. Great monthly deals if you sign a year contract.
2	Since tan factory combined with body heat the service has been so bad, I WILL never go back there. I only gave them 2 stars because the girls that work there r nice, their corporate office on the other hand I don't even know where to begin. They screwed over not just me, my younger brother and sister as well. Charged out account when they weren't supposed to, lied on the type of service we paid for, changed procedures n were so unsympathetic it's insane. DO NOT use their services, there are so many privately owned tanning salons that deserve out business! They may be cheaper but u will pay more in the long run.
4	I like this location. I have been 10+ times and I believe that the employees are generally upbeat and hard working. I have always gotten an even spray tan without complaints & the Versa has a heater in it to keep your warm despite the cold spray.
5	I love body heat. I have been going there for about 5 years now. Great service. If you have a problem, just call corporate and they will do their best to help you.
