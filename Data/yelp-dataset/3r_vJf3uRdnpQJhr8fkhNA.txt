5	This company has been out to my home twice. (. My upstairs and downstairs unit went out at different times). They are RELIABLE and fair in their pricing.  They call back and show up when they say they're going to.  A very friendly and pleasant staff I would recommend Cool Concepts to anyone in Las Vegas with air conditioning or heating issues.  This company goes above and beyond and is quick to respond. Let's face it, no one wants to go without air in the Vegas heat. Call Cool Concepts 702-395-0123
5	Recently had both my a/c units stop working 3 times in 3 months.  First time the main unit stopped I called someone out.  Ended up over charging and repair lasted 2 months.  Second time the secondary unit went.  Cool Concepts showed up on time, repaired the unit quickly, and the price was more the fair.  After the main unit went again, Cool Concepts came out the same day as calling them.  They once again for on time, repaired the other places poor work, and charged a fair price.  I will always use Cool Concepts and refer them to anyone in need.
5	Called on a Sunday Norm quickly responded that he can be onsite first thing Monday morning. Took care of the problem in 30 mins AC back up and running!! Great service  great price!!!
5	Extremely satisfied with this company. They came out earlier this year, after the company my home warranty sent out that said my unit could not be fixed and I needed a new one, Dave from cool concept came out, filled my Freon and got the unit working. On Saturday the unit stopped blowing cold air, I called them up the answering service picked up so i left a message not expecting a call until Monday but within 15 minutes Norm called and within an hour he was at my house and fixed my unit. He said that as long as we keep the unit serviced, should last a few more years. HONEST AND RELIABLE...
