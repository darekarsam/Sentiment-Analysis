3	Ichiban is a ramen restaurant.  Ramen is the famed Japanese egg noodle, which has its origin in China.  In Chinese it means litterally "pulled noodles".  I visited Japan last summer, where I had some excellent ramen.  The noodles are usually made fresh, boiled in hot water, served in an oily miso broth, with some condiments like sliced pork and hard boiled egg.  Ichiban does a fair job at representing this Japanese dish.  The noodles are fresh and firm, which is important, but it is not as firm as it should be.  They are also thin and straight here, instead of being slighly thicker and curly, which is also typical in Japan.  The portions and prices here are also comparable to Japan, which I find to be ironic, since Japan is supposed to be the most expensive country in the world, not Canada.  Also the restaurant is owned and operated by Chinese people, not Japanese, but not that I would hold it against them.It's OK, but not spetacular, but I suspect it will do fine by most Quebecois :)
3	went there a few weeks ago,had some ramen, and the fried chicken wings.the ramen was ok, nothing spectacular... the chicken wings were great though, very happy about that. price is quite decent, but ramen price has inflated quite a bit...only 700 yen in tokyo (about 7$), is it supposed to be so steep here? about 10$ if i remember correctly... it's a bowl of noodles, with minced meat, please can you say extortion? really...having tried Summo ramen and Kazu, i'd say this ranks third in mtl... ;)Check out Kazu for lunch for some real ramen, yeah pricey there too i think it's 10 or 12$, but at least it's good. And way better than Ippodu ny no ramen is worth 18$ i don't care if it's in nyc... Ippodu is way too overrated.
