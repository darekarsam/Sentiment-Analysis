3	Simple and convenient. The need to be a little better about having hot dogs ready cooked for lunch rush. It seems like every time I went in there in the past 2 weeks the hot dogs were never ready.
3	The annoying thing about a crowded convenience store is that it is no convenience at all.  This is how it happens for me at least once a month.... It's the end of the day.  I look down and see my gas indicator is creeping to the right and gravity wants to bring it down.   But I, foolishly, make the decision to  drive pass this station and skip the fill up because I'm tired.  I have to let the dog out.  I'm hungry.  I gotta pee!  I just want to get home!  So, I tell myself, "I'll leave 5 mins early in the morning to get gas."   Next morning rolls around...... oh shizzle, I'm late.   I scramble outta bed and get dressed because I have an 8am meeting and I barely have enough time to get  there!  Jump in the car,  open the garage and pull off to work from my house thinking,  "I can make it to the parking lot by 8, so I'll be 2 or 3 mins late.   Then something in my brain signals, "Look at your gas hand."  I look down and suddenly the memory of the rush to get home the night before roars back into my thoughts!  That DAMN gas light is on.   W.   T.   F. was I thinking last night.  I gotta get gas now.  I pull in to this convenience store in a rush and in comes the irony that smacks me in the face?  Convenience?  I think not. A crowded gas station where I have to wait for a pump almost every weekday is no convenience my friend. On a good day though,  clean and friendly people.  Gas is always there.   Cold water in the cooler.   Smell of coffee.  It's good enough for me on my commute.  Just stop calling it a convenience store!  ;-)
4	Close to work this is a very easy in and out for me to get gas. Clean and plenty of pumps so never crowded when I have pulled in.
