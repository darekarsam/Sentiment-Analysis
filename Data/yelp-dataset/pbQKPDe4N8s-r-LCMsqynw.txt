5	Excellent service, and reasonable prices.  They installed my brake parts at a very fair price, and did the job thoroughly.This is the place I'll be going back to whenever I buy my own parts, but want a pro to do the job.
5	GREAT FIRST IMPRESSION!   First time will NOT be last time here! Personable, knowledgeable, fast....Great repair.    Other mechanic had told me erroneous information on what was wrong with my vehicle.  Las Vegas Auto Air and Service Center quickly diagnosed the correct problem and fixed it.  It did not cost me hundreds of dollars, as the previous shop had told me.  Ladies, this shop is lady friendly:  they will not give you the same hype to cheat you out of money.  You get the repairs needed and the service is EXCELLENT!  I highly recommend this shop!
5	if you need an honest knowledgeable mechanic who isn't going to try to rip you off then Desmond is the man to see.  I have been going to him for several years and he is always more than fair.
