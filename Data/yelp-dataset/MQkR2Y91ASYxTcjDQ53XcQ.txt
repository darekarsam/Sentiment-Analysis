4	Great Taco Bell. They always ask a couple of times if you want sauce, and I've never NEVER had my order messed up here. That can't be said for a lot of other fast food places nowadays.:)
4	Quick service, excellent value for money.
4	Dining Room closed at 10PM on a Friday ?Are you kidding me ?  My four year old son and I ended up having to eat our meal in my truck because the dining room was closed.Anyways, the food is always fresh.  Reasonably priced.  Employees are competent and happy.  I have had no bad experience here.
3	They love to get my order wrong.
1	Tuesday at 5 pm .1) No a.c. in building 2 fans set up for ventilation2) Not good food and sorta luke warm 3) Bathrooms smell like raw sewage !!! It is very sad that a company makes 500 million a year and the CEO of the company makes 40 million a year but there resteraunts that have hard working employees at minimum wage must suffer ... so sad that this can be legal ( I work for Fire safety and am in fast food and resteraunts almost all day long and no this is not just one occurrence , stuff never gets fixed ) SO SAD
5	I have avoided Taco Bell for years but was stuck with no other options in this neighborhood. I was shocked!Great food!!! Great service!!! The Doritos Fiery Taco was FANTASTIC! This is the best Taco Bell I've been in literally in 20 years!!Teresa was super friendly and the service workers in the back were friendly too. When I'm back in this neighborhood I'll definitely be back :-)
3	food is fresh and warm!!
