4	We discovered Zagrum today while wandering down Fleury after finding our usual diner breakfast joint closed. Our "greasy spoon" breakfast of 2 eggs, sausages, brown toast, homefries, fruit and coffee cost $7. A bit pricey for a basic breakfast but at least the fruit was fancy (pineapple, strawberry, orange, melon, blackberry), the homefries were real potatoes (not frozen potato product), and the toast was made from good-quality bread. I also appreciated that they had soy milk available for my coffee.I couldn't help spying on the person at the table next to me, who had a "maki roll" breakfast -- little rolls of crepes with smoked salmon and asparagus drenched in hollandaise. She seemed to enjoy it. I managed not to ask her for a bite.
