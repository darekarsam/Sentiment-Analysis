3	I went to Cuthbert for lunch with a friend on a Saturday afternoon.  The place was very quiet and we got nice comfy sofas.  After much deliberation and getting up to see the board of specials, which you cannot read unless you are close, we opted for omelettes.  I ordered salmon and spinach, and my friend spinach, salmon and onion.  We also ordered some coffees.  The first coffees arrived reasonably quickly, then we waited for our omelettes, and waited, and waited, and waited.  After a very long wait, the waiter eventually brought them to us.  We agreed that they were very nice and well cooked.  But surely, in an almost empty cafe, one shouldn't have to wait about 40 mins for an omelette, which after all, doesn't take that long to make.Then we decided to have some cake, and another coffee.  We had spotted a gluten-free coffee cake, which looked very nice. Again, we waited, and waited.  The cakes eventually arrived, followed by the coffees.  How disappointing, we were expecting a nice moist guy cake, and it was dry, very dry!Overall an average experience, the coffee is OK, the omelettes are good, the cakes, well, maybe we were just unlucky...  But there is no excuse to make customers wait that long when there are hardly any other customers.However, as the place is quiet, I would go back for coffee with my laptop to do some work as it is not packed with kids which is totally an advantage compared to the place next door.
3	Its average...thats all I can say really! For me with Loudons as a neighbour they really need to up their game!Service is questionable, coffee is ok and the food is well average!Its ok.....if you cant get a table at Loudons....dont see why else you would bother coming here!
