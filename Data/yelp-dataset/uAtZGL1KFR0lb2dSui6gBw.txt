2	Bargain Land is a junk lover's paradise. Trying to emulate a Red, White, and Blue or Goodwill store, this family owned business falls just a bit short. There is used clothing, books, games, furniture, cd's and flea market style odds and ends. Lets say what Bargain Land sells, Goodwill would reject.
5	This is a great place of you are  strapped and know what you are looking for.  bought a new  coffee maker,  massive  wood table with chairs, new tea pot and some cheesy owl ornaments for $35. Half of what goodwill and salvation  army was selling. Even better is that if you wasn't something pretty specific they well take your name and number and call when/if  it comes in. Finally, Bargain land has the nicest people I have ever met. Extremely helpful and kind.
1	Don't give your money to these crackheads. There is no charity, they hit the pipe all day.
5	Everything in the store is $1-- how can you beat that?! I have found many cool things for $1 there-- even a stone pampered chef pan, wall clock and nice table lamp! It's overwhelmed with stuff (a lot is just junk) but I find it's fun to hunt for the $1 treasures that are there and enjoy stopping in every week or so! The staff is friendly and helpful and it's worth the stop if you like bargain shopping!
4	i collect vintage halloween and christmas stuff and found some good deals, got a huge 5 ft tall  plastic santa sign for $7(which the exact same one in an antique store was $35) and some good quality tablecloth/blankets for $3-5 dollars This store is cheaper than other thrift stores so i always come here first, then move on to another thrift store. I have found nortake japanese expensive china in the basement really cheap for 50 cents a piece and i didnt want to impulse buy so i said i think about it for 48 hrs and come back, it was gone. Some stuff in the basement is dusty broke/dented/bent should only be 25 cents not $3. HUGE SELECTION like an hour to really look thru everything.
