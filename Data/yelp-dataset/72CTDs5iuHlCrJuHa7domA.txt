4	Home away from home! Went on a road trip and found this gem in downtown Phoenix! It's nothing fancy but it has everything you need. Well-kept rooms and the staff is very welcoming and friendly. Pilo at the front desk is the perfect embodiment of what guest service should be.  Jerry and his dog Rambo makes you feel safe! Overall experience is very pleasant and room rate is reasonable.  I'm definitely going back!
1	Californian staying overnight for business in Arizona  for the first time, definitely didn't leave with a good impression. In all fairness, the attendant did warn us that the hotel was under renovation, but he said our room had already been completed. However, when we got to the room, it looks as though they had just done a shotty patchwork job. The cold, unpolished and exposed concrete floors were covered with a flimsy runner. The sheets, temp unit and furniture were dirty. The table, toilet, telephone and bathroom door were old and scratched. Although the matturesses appeared new, they definitely didn't feel like it.  The only redeeming quality of the hotel was the pool area, but even with that there were problems (the pool bottom needed regrouting). The minor upgrades (flat screen, keurig, granite bathroom counter) and friendly staff absolutely did not make up for the state of horror the hotel is in and I would never stay there again.
1	less than a week later I received an unknown charge for $70.00 from a company I didn't recognize (SMELL/SNELL?) so I followed up on it and it turned out to be the hotel trying to charge me for the room that I had already pre-paid for on travelocity. When I called for a refund, they didn't try to dispute/find the fault in their error, which makes me very suspicious. If you stay/have stayed in this hotel check your statements!
