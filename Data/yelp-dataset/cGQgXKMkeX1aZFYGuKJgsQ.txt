4	This place delivers, and in more ways than one.The food from here is amazing Thai cuisine - there is a huge selection to choose from in the extensive and traditional menu, and if I could eat takeaway food every day I would start at the top and work my way through as they all sound lovely. Delivery is fast as well, like really fast - but only if you catch it on a good day, on more than one occasion I have expected super fast and got average, but I cant complain - its still quicker than most places.
4	There are such a myriad of takeaways on Leith Walk that it can be hard to know where to go for your instant Asian food fix.  I can't claim to have sampled every single one, but I can tell you that Lan Thai stands out from the crowd.Not your run of the mill MSG-flavoured greasy slop with a tub of undercooked rice, Lan Thai instead provides mouth-watering Thai curry, and Pad Thai that does not disappoint.   I'm not going to rave about its "authenticity" or overall cultural experience - there's nothing exceptional about the ordinary, neon-signed shop or the slightly hassled staff who take your order, but I can promise you that the food tastes good, which is, after all, what you want from a takeaway.  My over-excited flatmate described her red curry as "a coconut orgasm in my mouth" - if that's not a recommendation, I don't know what is.
