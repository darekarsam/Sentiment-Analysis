1	I've bought 2 sets of clubs from James at Custom Golf Center in Tempe, AZ  and one for my wife.   With the second purchase we had several issues with customer service (James didn't return calls or emails) but after a long ordeal we loved the clubs.   These clubs were stolen out of the trunk of our car  and have tried to reorder the same clubs from Custom Golf Center but after over 3 weeks of calls and emails...... NOTHING.So James and Custom Golf Center is either out of business, dead, hiding, in jail...... who knows but certainly avoids someone wanting to spend money.   Avoid this company.Jim N heyyobuddy@cox.net Scottsdale, AZ
1	if i could give this "company" (and i use that term loosely) negative stars i would!!! where do i start? fist it's been almost a month since my order and gee...nothing yet! try calling the number on website...."voice mailbox is full".....try emailing james, no response!! try calling back 4 more times "voice mailbox is full.........so i wait a couple days hoping for a return email.....nothing!!! try calling back again......now it says " the number you are trying to reach has a voice mail that has not been set up yet"........wtf is wrong with this guy? he (james) claims to be in business for over 10 years now, well guess what, people that are in business for that length of time usually have a secretary that is capable of handling emails and telephone calls.......i only write a bad review on here, because it seems to be the only way to get a response from you james.....question is, is this even going to work? probably not!!!! and by the way.....keep the clubs i ordered, i do not want them!!!! they will be sent back before they even leave the truck!!!!!! not to mention, that now the website has an "invalid certifcate" at this point!!!
