2	We pasted through here on a Thursday lunch hour.  The restaurant was quite empty. We ordered the soup and famous smoked meat sandwich.  The smoke meat was fabulous.  The soup came in a huge 2-3 cup sized bowl.  The chicken noodle soup did not have much chicken flavor and seemed watered down.  My ginger ale was flat and the server replaced my drink with a can promptly.We have been to the Decarie location and the food seems to be better there.
2	Had the smoked meet with a side of poutine (had to go with the whole experience). Good smoked meat, although I've had better.  The service was good, but very slow.
2	Pros- Smoked meat was quite tastyCons- Decor was all shotti and clearly painted/furnished half ass- My chicken club was very dry- Service was super slow- I felt like I was paying for the brand and not the quality of the food.Conclusion:I'd go there for late night munchies over Chenoy's but I don't see another reason why I'd find myself there. This doesn't deter me at all from going to the downtown location.
