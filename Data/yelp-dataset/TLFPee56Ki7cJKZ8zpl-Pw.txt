1	I know it is  Denny's but still. Come on Denny you have competition for good cheap breakfasts nowadays. You used to have a reasonable priced, okay breakfast. What happened? I ate here on 6/4/13 and the coffee was cold, the eggs were ice cold and runny, the English Muffin was raw, not toasted at all and the fruit was actually spoiled. (brown bananas and sour, pruny, moldy grapes, WTH?) The bill was 10 dollars and change. OH MY! The server was nice but overworked. This is not the first time this location has had problems. We used to go here for our welcome back breakfast at school. It was bad. One time it took 1 hour to get my food and I got sick later on. YIKES.
4	I like the wait staff but the burger was too sawgy with so much grease other than that awesome
1	Horrible greasy food.Gm didn't care at all when we complained.Management reflects overall very poor experience. My tummy still hurts!
1	If I could give 0 stars I would. We didn't even get a chance to eat anything there.My husband, son, and I went on 12/11/14 for Dinner. When I get paid is the only time we get to go out to eat as a treat. There was only about 12 tables that had people at them, and most of them already had food. After 10 minutes of being seated, and my son completing almost all the activities on the kid menu, no one ever acknowledged us or took our drink orders. We got up and left and went to chinese buffet across the street which cost us about the same if not less than Denny's. My husband has worked as a server for over 16 years and he was so angry with the horrible service and advised me we will not go to this location again as this is not the 1st time we've had horrible service.
