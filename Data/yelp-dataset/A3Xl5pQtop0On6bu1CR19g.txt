4	I love grabbing a drink as I head into Target for a little extra juice while shopping for whatever I need.The girls who generally work at this location are funny and accommodating.  They will joke around with you while they are making your drink and are never skimpy on the whipped cream topping.  When it's warm, I get the delicious frappuccino, when it's cold, I opt for the salted caramel macchiato. Can't go wrong either way.It's Starbucks, so it isn't cheap, but the employees at this location have no issue making sure you get 12oz-30oz of delicious drink.
4	This location is consistently a hit for me... I love being able to pick up something to give me a little jolt to get my shopping done... The staff are super friendly and they remember you if you come more than a few times... I've never had a poorly made drink and sometimes they have samples! Free things make me happy... :)
3	It looks like a Starbucks. It tastes like a Starbucks. But don't let it fool you... It's not a real Starbucks. It's a license store operated by Target. There are subtle differences that most people won't notice or care about. Like they won't honor certain promos from Starbucks corporate and they use Target brand Market Pantry milk. But the location is super convenient if you need a little pick me up before hitting Target's aisles.The drinks are usually good but service can be hit it miss. Sometimes the employees are really friendly and other times they are pretty frazzled and short. Overall, it's a-ok in my book.
1	This Starbucks never has gotten anything correct, not to mention you usually have to hunt them down. There's never anyone over there and you always have to wait for them to come over.
