4	I was in search of specific paper for a project I am working on and this store is fairly close to me and came recommend by a few friends (one who used to be an employee)!They didn't have what I needed, but they did have plenty of other paper options and both of the ladies working the store that day were very helpful and personable.  I did find their pricing on some items to be out of line with other stores, but they did have a coupon by the register that I could use for a discount off a single item.  I would definitely return when I need further materials and I would like to take advantage of their class schedule to learn some new techniques!
5	Love this store.  The paper collection is a paper junky's dream.  Great classes and an awesome staff.  Always a load of fun.
5	This store has it all! Great supplies, wonderful variety, excellent staff, and interesting classes, plus a large work space for cropping on Friday nights. If they don't have what you need, Debbie can see if she can order it for you.I love this store!  Hope all paper crafters will visit and give Family Memories your business.
