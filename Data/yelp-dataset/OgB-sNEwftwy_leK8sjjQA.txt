1	Fabulously unethical company!  Congratulation Go Tow you had zero reviews and you just got your first and it's a 1-star.  I'd give negative stars if I could help it.  This company tows vehicles that are parked LEGALLY.  Then they refuse to release them if the owner doesn't pay.Out of principle, I will not conduct business with any company that uses Go Tow's services.  Go Tow uses legal loopholes to extort money out of unknowing bi-standards.  They are committing grand theft auto and getting away with it because the people they victimize are in positions of weakness.  If you want to be extorted then this is the go to company.  Otherwise avoid Go Tow like the plague.
1	These jerks towed my car when we were eating at the brass rail on 40th st and Thomas.....there were no signs that said "NO RESTURANT PARKING"   we have been eating at the brass rail for years and parked there numerous times.  the tow truck driver had to have been sitting in the parking lot, because they towed the car 3 minutes after we parked.  BULLSHIT!   These guys should be out of business!!!
