5	I like this location because you can do your shopping and grab a drink along the way. Easily accessible for taking a breather while on a shopping trip. It is popular though, so expect a line and a wait.
4	Quick service and reliable and fast. However, they used some marker on the cup to write the names that got stuck to my fingers, and in turn, transferring it to my phone. It doesn't come off with water, so I will try acetone or alcohol when I get home. I'm not worried about the phone, but I feel like the issue should be brought to someone's attention, especially if they are wearing white/light color clothing. This is the first Starbucks I've experienced this problem with.
2	Slow.......so slow.....and I'm so fed up with not being able to use my rewards. You are either a Starbucks or you are not!
