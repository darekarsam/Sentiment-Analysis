5	Organized, professional, and personable. Sheila always does a great job and has been my stylist for close to a year now. I won't go anywhere else. The location is convenient and quaint, and I never feel pressured to buy anything I don't want to like at other places. I highly recommend Sheila and Eclipz!
5	I went to this salon for the first time just this week. The salon is clean and each salon is easy to locate. I saw Andrea Croci(who has been coloring my hair for four years) and Casey Fox(who has been cutting my hair for almost a year now). The atmosphere of the salon was very calm and relaxed which is a major change from what I'm used to over the years. I love my color and my cut and I will be going back.
5	I just went to Eclipz for the first time yesterday. It was such a great experience and I love how my hair looks! Andrea and Casey are seriously awesome at what they do!
5	So I'm back on yelp just to write this review. I was referred over to Andrea by my brother in law who had worked with her at Toni & Guy in the past. She was super cool and listened to what I wanted. She did an excellent job, even meeting my high expectations. I'm in love with my color and I'm so hard to please! Found my new color girl. Thanks Andrea!
