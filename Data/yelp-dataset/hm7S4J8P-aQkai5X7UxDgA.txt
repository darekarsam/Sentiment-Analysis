4	This place is absolutely great if you want to eat really tasty Indian food, and have some intimate dining. We had a great experience here. I have eaten Indian food in over 50 places around the world, and this place is definitely top 10. Seriously.Very tasty food, and reasonable prices for that. Though it is a tad on the intimate/pricey side.If you just want to chow on tasty Indian, and not pay that extra, or really have wine etc, then go to Maison India next door. It's a more casual place.
4	So far I've been there 4 times and always enjoyed my experience. Service was friendly and helpful with great suggestions when you ask. I did like that I was able to swap any option in there combo dinners, man places don't. If you like spicy dishes try the Bangalore Phai chicken. Naan was incredible and so were the Samosa.There is one Down town as well..both i would recommend.
