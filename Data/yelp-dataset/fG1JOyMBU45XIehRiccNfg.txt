1	I had a very important, 36 page fax that needed to be sent.  I got up early at 5am and headed to this FedEx Kinkos.  Would you believe they wanted $55, YES, FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS to send a fax to a LOCAL PHONE NUMBER.  $1.99 for the first page and $1.50 for each addtl page.  Now, I'm all for a guy making an honest profit, but this should be illegal.  Their costs for said fax would have been about $0.18 and they were going to charge me $55.Fortunately (or not) the counter person was not well trained and was unable to get the fax to go through.  I took it to another location and they faxed it right away without any problems - and FOR FREE !!SHAME on you FedEx Kinkos, SHAME, SHAME, SHAME.   I will think twice before using you greedy robbers again.  HOW do you sleep at night?  SHAME ON YOU.
4	While away on vacation I had to mail a $1500 cashier's check to my Realtor in Florida and I sure wasn't going to use USPS for something important.  We ran down there and the staff was friendly and they were having a pretty fun conversation.  Everyone seemed upbeat and the place was clean. I would recommend FedEx over most shipping companies ESPECIALLY if you're shipping anything of value or if it needs a signature. USPS is a joke and UPS doesn't seem to be very strict on important things like signatures and where they deliver the item to. (i.e. neighbors, front door, office buildings)
