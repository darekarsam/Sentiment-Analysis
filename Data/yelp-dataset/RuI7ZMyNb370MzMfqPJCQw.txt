5	Phenomenal school.  Good luck getting your student in!
3	My children attended this school for 4 years. The teachers are for the most part amazing. The parents are amazing and so are the students. We decided to leave this year and return to our public home school. What finally did me in was the constant micro managing of the dress code at this school. I am all for school uniforms, but this school takes it to an extreme level. The kids backpacks, socks, shoes, nail color , hair bows just to name a few were just To much for me to keep up with.  Oh and even their lunch boxes have to be a certain color. Seriously, I just couldn't keep up. Also Dr. Musser is less than friendly to the parents. She does have her favorites ($$$), that she will actually make eye contact with and speak with. I believe she is just a very shy and anti- social person. Not a true leader that is required for a School such as this. My kids enjoyed their time there, but are over the moon to be back in their public school setting.
1	I stopped into this school to see about student enrollment and learn more about the school. The front office staff virtually ignored me for about ten minutes before I finally said something.  When I asked about the school, I was told everything I needed to know was online. The counter ladies were extremely rude, did not make eye contact, and dismissed me like I was bothering them. Since I have much higher expectations of my children's learning experiences and the people that work with them, I went elsewhere. I recommend you do the same.
