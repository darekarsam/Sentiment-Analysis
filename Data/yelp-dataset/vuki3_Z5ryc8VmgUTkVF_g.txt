5	Friendly, trendy, easy-to-find, good service, smart repairs.Bonus points for adorable yorkie puppy named Ginger who hangs out in back.
1	Absolutely do not use. Despite what I had heard from others, I went to these guys anyway and paid for it. I simply wanted more RAM put in my computer. When the job was done I picked up my computer and it wouldn't turn on. Once I called them and told them this, they said that it was my fault and my computer must've had problems beforehand. My computer was perfectly fine before it went to these guys. They were also very difficult in the process. DO NOT USE!
5	These people who work here are incredibly helpful and nice. I brought my laptop here for some upgrades and now it is as good as new and working better than ever. I wish I caught the name of the guy who helped me, but I got  WAY better than any service I've received from a MAC store. Also, good prices.
