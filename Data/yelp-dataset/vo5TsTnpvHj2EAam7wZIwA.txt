5	I love everything about Paragon.  The decor is adorable, the staff, friendly and helpful, and the cuts fabulous!  Ashley does a spectacular job on my rather unruly curly locks.  In a sea of hair salons, Paragon really stands out. Plus, there are some great restaurants nearby, and a cute little shop at 1111 Central. Love it!
5	I have been getting my hair cut here since I moved back from Colorado.  Never had a haircut I liked in my life before this place.  Mellisa Does an awesome job and I wont stop going back as long as I live in Charlotte.
5	I love Paragon Salon. Ashley and Melissa are terrific and I've seen some great "do's" from others as well. The receptionist is one of the most helpful of any salon I've visited. Go to the store next door and browse while your color is cooking.
