5	What an amazing church to hold a wedding.  I was the wedding photographer for a wedding that was held at this church on May 18, 2013.  When i arrived early the actual church looked dark, but as the guest started walking in, they lit it up perfectly and there was a ton of natural light too!  The wedding coordinator Susan Bennett was very nice and let me do my thing.  I can't say enough about this church, I have photographed at other churches in Las Vegas, but hands down this is my new favorite church in town for weddings. :)
5	Beautiful church, I wouldn't mind getting married here :)My family and I go here whenever we are in town for vacation...the ambience is simple, yet beautiful in my opinion...what I like most about this church is that it has a "crying" room...this is the only Catholic church I've been to thus far that has one...I find it convenient especially for parents when their children get fussy...they can stay in that room and still listen to the mass without having to actually walk out of the church and miss out on it entirelyParking can be a hassle sometimes, so allow yourself enough time to get here and find parkingDid I mention the church is located in a very nice neighborhood...dream homes galore...hello! :)
5	This church is very welcoming. I love how they have a lot of different times to attend mass on Sunday. Be sure to come early because it gets packed.
