5	Cannot recommend highly enough!Joe and I moved flat last weekend and although we moved most of our stuff ourselves, we hired the man with a van for an hour (one man and one van) on Saturday morning. We needed help moving our bed and other larger items of furniture. The man and his van arrived right on time and worked very fast and efficiently for the full hour resulting in a van load of stuff safely transported from our old flat to the new flat.I have nothing but positive feedback for this company and I will recommend to all of my friends to use them.Next time we move (in many years time) we'll definitely use them again and for longer!
5	5 stars service, very professional. Very easy communication, easy to contact, as I was given a direct contact of the person who was moving us. They spoke to me the night before and also sent me a text 10 minutes before their arrival as well.  All our boxes were taken into their brand new and very spacious car in no time. They were really quick to move the things to our new address. All things were handled with care and attention to what I was commenting. They were so kind and even helped me to move a very heavy old TV inside the old house to its original place.Also take into account that it was a very short notice! Good value for money.I am really happy with the service we received. It couldn't be better. I can definitely recommend this company! Thank you, guys!
