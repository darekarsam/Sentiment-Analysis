5	This place is really hit or miss depending on what you ordered. The fiance ordered some maple syrup crepe that tasted horrible. However, I ordered the raspberry crisp. It's this AMAZING crispy french toast with crumbs on the outside. OMG trust me.. it's just the best thing you'll ever taste. No joke. GO THERE AND ORDER IT!! I should have taken a picture but I seriously was too busy devouring this freaking amazing dish. It's super light and fluffy yet crispy on the outside. Ummmm Their coffee and bagels are meh.
5	Wow! I don't even know where to begin with how awesome this place is! From the outside it doesn't seem like much,but once inside the face that it's so large while still giving off a comfy feel is already impressive. As we stood and waited to be seated we noticed how amazing the food that was being served looked, so we were excited to sit down. Our waitress was the epitome of great. She made suggestions, checked on us often, and made small talk. The fact that there is an English version of the menu was such a relief! As we looked at the pictures in the menu we wanted to order everything! We settled on the bagel with cream cheese, lox, tomato, onion and capers served with fresh fruit. If you think they just made the food look fancy in the menu you've got another thing coming b/c it is just as impressive in person! The fruit was carved into cool patterns and there was an orchid on the plate! I had to take a picture. I was hoping that the taste would live up to the beauty and boy did it! Everything was deeelicious! We were told that even the type of orchid they use is edible! This place made me wish I lived in Montreal, so I could come more often!
2	less than average breakfast joint .If they don't have fresh orange juice , they shouldn't be calling it tutti frutti.never again
5	I come here just for the fruit plates. Absolutely delicious! Oh and the coffee is AWESOME too!
