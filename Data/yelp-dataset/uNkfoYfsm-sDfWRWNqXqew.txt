1	Awful Italian experience!Not only was the service slow, the food was dreadful. Came here in a family dinner, we were about 22people. Every single one of us got sick when we got back home. We all had different meals and yet we all got really sick!It was a horrible experience
1	Horrible food. Place was very noisy, couldn't hear each other talk. Ordered their fettuccine alfredo, looked like a cream of fettuccine soup. Very bland.
2	In terms of Italian cuisine, there are plenty of choices to turn to in the Montreal and Laval area. And with the surplus of Italian restaurants in both cities, if you're not the best, you're somewhere lost in the middle.Based on my meal, I'd say Lugano's falls in the middle. I ordered the rotollo pasta (which is, in essence, a roll of pasta with ricotta cheese between layers and then smothered with mozzarella). Firstly, we received our meal within 10 minutes of ordering it. Maybe even less. That kinda turned me off, as I would have preferred to wait longer to keep up with the illusion that our meal was made fresh and not just freshly served. I get that restaurants do a fair amount of prep before service, but the place was really full; even if it was prepared earlier, the pastas texture was off. The pasta was soft, the stuffing was bland, and the sauce had little flavour. To put concisely, it lacked depth. Not even the oozing mozzarella topping saved it. On the plus side, super warm baguette served before your meal is a win no matter how good or bad the food is, so that was appreciated. We were in an out of there in less than half an hour. Service was incredibly efficient! My meal could've used a little more TLC though.
