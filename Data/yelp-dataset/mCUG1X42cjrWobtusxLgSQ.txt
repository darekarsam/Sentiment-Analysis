1	We were staying at the Fraser Suites Hotel which is great so we thought this restaurant would be great too. We came about 30 minutes before their breakfast ends. We decided to do their breakfast buffet. When we got to the food table, there were hardly any food left. We started with what they have at the moment thinking they would replenish the almost empty containers on the table. We waited but they did not. We asked and the only answer we got is 'sorry, no". We ended up scavenging the food containers for whatever food we can get which is just horrible after we paid about 12 pounds each. And whatever food we got, they were not great. They should have not offered us the breakfast buffet if they knew they willnot replenish the food. We would have just ordered food from the menu. The interior is nice though... but you can't eat it. You'd rather go to places like World's End, Rabbie Burn's and many other places that serves breakfast than eat here. You'll get your money's worth elsewhere.
3	Four of us dined on a Sunday evening and left satisfied on the whole. We started with a fish sharing board, which included mackerel, salmon, and I believe trout, along with eggplant slices and other vegetables. Very good starter. My date has this thing about haggis - he has toured all around the UK and tries it wherever it's offered. The verdict was a decent haggis, which I tasted (off the bucket list). I had the chicken wrapped in Parma ham - "dry" was my overall impression. Salads were good.The alcohol solution was pretty positive. Innis and Gunn in the bottle, a nice brew indeed. Also very nice scotch. Glenkinchie was the special - loved it.The service was polite but a little disorganized.I was surprised that two reviews were one star. It was not a total disaster like the other reviewers wrote (perhaps they've upped their game in the meantime?) - there was something good for everyone.
