5	I had my birthday party here (JONMAGEDDON) and it was off the chain!  We did karaoke and got waisted!  The space is amazing. I defiantly recommend.
5	Beautiful space and so refreshing for this little zone of Parc Ave! Maybe 200 capacity? A balcony, a beautiful bar, beers from 4-6$, couches and room to dance, seems like a nice sound set up for the bands I've seen in there so far. The layout is perfect for good visibility and nice vibrations. Wishing Jackie & Judy nothing but the best!
4	Awesome little venue. Cute interior with a front sitting area, bar and stage in the back. Concerts, dj nights, karaoke and queer friendly events. Good bar selection. Great place to see a cheap show. Just a word of caution, and don't let it discourage you from checking this place out-be sure to take advantage of the coat check as there's a serial phone nabber who frequents this joint. Other than that, worth the trip up parc!
