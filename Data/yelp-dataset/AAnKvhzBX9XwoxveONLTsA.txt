1	A newer location amongst the Asian cuisine on St Catherine in the stretch between Guy and Atwater. It has most of what you'd expect for a noodle place on the menu, plus the secret "Chinese" menu written only in Traditional.  It should be noted it is cash only.Unfortunately Becca H has hit the nail on the head with the service issue. My entire meal took north of 90 minutes, frequently having to wave the server, or attempt to get their attention, often to my dismay to have them see it, then immediately look away and dart back to the kitchen.  If it were busy, this might have been more agreeable, but for less than half the tables sat, I felt intentionally ignored.  Foodwise, the place is just OK. There's nothing magical here, there's nothing great, it's cheap, and a you get what you pay for kind of experience. Placing it somewhere above say, fast food, and somewhere below everything else in that area. This one will be a pass for me in the future.
1	Can we give reviews negative stars? Had 2 soups and both tasted like dishwater. Even the Won-Ton soup after dumping half the soy sauce bottle in there tasted flat and bland. The beef Tom Yum has offal in it but wasn't explicit in the menu, thanks for the heads up. Offal ain't for everyone.  The beef in the soup was dry... like what the what what now?Also on this note. If your restaurant has the word NOODLE and CHEF in it, make the noodles, don't bring in manufactured crud. Wooden chop sticks wouldn't hurt either. Picking up dumplings with plastic chop sticks ain't much fun.The restaurant is a fucking mess. We could see a huge pile of garbage in the back. NEVER EVER GO THERE.
