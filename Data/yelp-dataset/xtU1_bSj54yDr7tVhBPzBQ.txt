1	My wife bought a $26 lip gloss here.  Turned out it was three months after its expiration date, so it was all gummy and unusable.  Should have checked before she left the store, but who expects that?  Anyways, can't go back to the store because I don't live in Canada.  Sent an email to customer service a week ago -- no response yet.Please take your expired items off the shelves!
5	The only Shoppers Drug Mart (aka Pharmaprix in Quebec) in Montreal's very bohemian Village area. Large selection of beverages, snacks, and other necessities for residents and travelers alike.  The store also includes the only Canada Post location in the area (that I've seen) and all cashiers sell stamps (domestic, USA, and foreign rate) for tourists looking to mail postcards.
5	Best cosmetic department in any store from the region! Very friendly, almost feel like home! If you need good advices about products you should definitely check this store.
2	I specifically went to this Pharmaprix to use the Canada Post outlet in the back. It was probably the most unpleasant postal experience to date. The staff were dour, barely making eye contact with the customers and rushing everyone through as if they couldn't wait for their shifts to be over. I will avoid this CP in the future. Only in desperation would I give them my business again.
