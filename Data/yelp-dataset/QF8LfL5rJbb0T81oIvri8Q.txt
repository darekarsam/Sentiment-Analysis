2	Named after the famous bar in the Florida Keys, where Papa got inspiration for his famous works of literature. Unfortunately, the name is where the similarities end. This is just another neighborhood bar, they do serve food, and have some mighty tasty sandwiches. Nice selection of brews and full bar. Also unfortunate is the rough crowd that hangs out here. During the day it's an old man bar. At night, let's just say its not the kind of place you want to bring your wife for a night out. Pretty popular with the college guys who live on the mount.
1	I wish I read the previous review before walking in here one night with my girlfriend. This place is a rough one to hang out in. Needless to say, our stay here was uncomfortable and short.
2	This place is your average hole in the wall dive bar.  Pros: good beer selection and pleasant, attentive bartenders.  Cons: small interior, bartenders use "cheat sheets" for common drinks (although maybe this is a pro since they care enough not to wing it), and the crowd varies from old timers to a more rough and tumble crowd.
