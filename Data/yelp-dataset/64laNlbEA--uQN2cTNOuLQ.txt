1	I just moved cross-country from Phoenix to North Carolina. After doing my research I decided to use U-pack for my move. Moving Staffers then sub-contracted and assigned Diamondback movers to pack my things into the relocube.  I felt good about this. All the reviews were great, the woman on the phone reassured me they were experts.  When the 2 men came to pack up my move, from my standpoint I thought they did a great job....but I am not an expert...hence the reason to hire movers.. Right??   I mean I am not going to a plumber to get my teeth cleaned.Yesterday, I got my relocubes out storage in North Carolina and hired new movers to help me.  The damage to my furniture was absolutely shocking.  Every piece of furniture was scratched,my bike, 2 rips in my sofa and my favorite popcorn bowl busted.  The movers said it was the worst they had ever seen.  The sad part is nothing can be done.  Moving staffers who contracted with them .. Stated..Liability ends when they leave your residence.  So basically .. It was the way the packed the cube .. They put heavy boxes on top of light ones, didn't cover items properly to prevent scratching during shift.  Do your research folks.. I thought I had done mine after hearing horror stories about moving.. Never did I think I would be a victim too.
1	Hired Diamondback Movers at the end of June to load my 1 bedroom apartment into 2 relo-cubes. They didn't show up the morning of the move. I called and left a message. Susan called me back within 20 minutes to let me know the movers arrived at their afternoon job first. She said they would be at my place within an hour, and would call me right back with a more specific time. When I never heard from her my husband and I did the move ourselves, in 115 degrees. Four hours later the foreman called, ready to start our job. My husband told him not to come.
