1	I purchased a ticket to Minneapolis from Madison, got to the stop 20 minutes early to wait for the bus. Then the bus drove by me AND DIDN'T STOP! He left me on the side of the rode. I called MegaBus 4 times -- and was hung up on twice because there was nothing more they could do and they needed to talk to other customers. I received NO REFUND. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.
