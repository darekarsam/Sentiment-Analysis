4	Helpful and knowledgable staff including foot measuring technology. Expensive but worth it.
5	The service is fantastic and the staff is really helpful. Nicolas was awesome. I love my new sneakers.
1	I was here last month to purchase a pair of Shoes and waited to be served, When the server came to me he asked if I spoke French and I said no, he then was serving me and another customer walked in and he just left me and went to serve the man in French, after 20 min he came back and when I requested 5 different pairs to see the size he told me they all were not in stock and kept wanting me to buy the most expensive one, which he would need to order.  I told 3 times I did not want the more expensive ones and he laughed and said in French Les juifs and laughed, (Jews) which I was visibly wearing a kippah Jewish scull cap.  I could not believe the service here!  Salesman name was Pierre, and there were 3 employees working that day, 1 was helping another customer another was free in the back.. If they really were busy they could have called the free one from the back... I was told by others that Les Ailes de la Mode has many workers who refuse to speak English and treat those who do speak English very poorly, just like the way I was!
