5	Every time I stop by the Cozy Home, I find a new gem. The owners are incredible -- and if you're looking for something particular, they'll create a wish list for you and email you when new items come in. I'm thrilled they've moved into our neighborhood.
5	With the number of times I've been to The Cozy Home in the last 30 days, I'm fairly certain I'm a settee away from BECOMING The Cozy Home. Not A cozy home (although my place is pretty cozy), but THE Cozy Home, because I wipe them clean of cool stuff! Ok, that might be a stretch, but I've been often, and enjoy the fact merchandise moves around and rotates frequently. This is important to note because if you love something, you should probably snatch it up right then and there. Though if you're a gambling man (or woman) you're rewarded for trying your luck. Every couple of weeks pieces are discounted more, prices which are reflected on tags.
5	This store is dangerous! I cannot walk out of there without buying something every single time. They do an amazing job with selecting very cool and funky items. Many of the pieces are solid wood, teak or other high-quality mid-century Eames-esque pieces. I find their prices to be excellent and I love their displays. Leah and her mom are customer service superstars and I'm so excited to have found the best consignment store in the Madison area!
