4	The staff at Urbana Tire Company have always been very friendly, knowledgeable, and incredibly helpful.They always provide real timely service at an affordable price and they don't give you the run-around with repair costs or deadlines.They are located close enough to downtown Urbana that if you drop off your car you can take a peaceful stroll down Main street, maybe stop by the book store, or drop into any one of the dining/drinking establishments to have a cool beverage and a tasty bite to eat while your car gets fixed.
5	The best in town for tire services!  They have repaired tires for me twice and also put on new tires.  They are always very friendly, honest and low-key, not pushy salespeople at all.  The work was great and done very quickly.  I feel like I can trust their input.They most recently repaired a tire for me that a larger chain store in town insisted was beyond repair.  I had gone to the larger store because it was Sunday and Urbana Tire was closed.  Through a series of events, it became clear that they were dishonest and only interested in selling tires at all costs, so I opted to wait to visit Urbana Tire on Monday when they opened.  They were perplexed by the diagnosis by the other shop of needing a new tire when the only issue was a screw about a half an inch inch long.  They fixed it quickly and put on 2 new tires, taking the time to explain my options and not at all pushing for the top of the line.As good as it gets!! :-)
5	Way more than tires!  All repairs, including warranty repairs can be done by ably by these folks.  Prompt, friendly, competent and convenient to get to, just across the street from Lincoln Square.
5	They got me in right away, had two new tires on in 45 minutes. Very easy, very informative. Great warranty and support. I'll definitely be back. Thanks, Ryan and crew!
