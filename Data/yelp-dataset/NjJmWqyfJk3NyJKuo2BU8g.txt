The place itself is located right on taschereau, perfect for families to meet up because it isnt too far from the highway, and of course for the locals. They have a nice terrace, but its right directly under the sun, so a nice shade would work perhaps. Anyways inside the place like always they have their seafoody, lime greeny on blue walls decor. Same booths and chairs to keep the chain thing going. Not much difference from the cote des neiges location, however this place is big on take out. Also I dont know if its because I went on a Thursday day shift, but theyre fish selection seemed smaller then the other places. And as always service was polite and courteus. I was very happy with my experience. Verdict: A must go for them fam jamz :)
4	Good quality price seafood restaurant. You pick the seafood in the counter like at a fish market and they prepare it for. The decor is a bit bare and the service is acceptable. Our waitress was very friendly, but the clerk at the fish counter was impatient and not friendly. The grilled octopus is amazing, my group liked all the seafood we ordered, but the brown rice was over spiced with cumin and too salty.
