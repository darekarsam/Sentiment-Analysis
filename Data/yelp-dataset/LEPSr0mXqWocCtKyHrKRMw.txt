1	The first time we used Davis they were fine.  I think they may have been sold after that because the last time we used them they were pretty bad.  They broke several items and made the process to get repairs done impossible.  The lady there was very curt and obnoxious.  We had items in storage that were delivered uncovered and filthy.  I would not recommend them at all.
4	Marlin is about as courteous as they come. He displayed great integrity and I would not hesitate to call him for anything.Thanks Marlin!
5	Davis Moving did such a great job for me--hard to believe there still are people in this world that actually care about the job they do for you, but the people from Davis Movers really do.  The two young men that did the job were fantastic--personable and friendly, really strong, and everything arrived safe and sound.  What more can you ask for?  Oh, and the bill was so reasonable I was happily surprised.  I just can't say enough good things about them.  You won't go wrong if you get them for your move.
