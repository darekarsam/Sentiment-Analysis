5	UBER was the best thing that happened to me here in Vegas! I take taxis all the time and they are horrible! Half of the time they don't even show up. I'm so upset that uber is no longer here. They always came in less then ten mins, your able to call or text your driver, watch and see where he is! Brilliant service!
2	this review is not good because I can't even get into their website or get there a app to download on my phone...they say they're in Las Vegas but I keep getting a problem when I try and get a quote for a trip...help!
2	They have suspended service in Nevada!  Only two stars cause they still list Las Vegas as served on their website and it took me 20 minutes to find out that is BA.
