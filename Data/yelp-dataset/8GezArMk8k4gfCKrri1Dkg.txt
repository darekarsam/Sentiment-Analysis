3	I wish I didn't have to come down here. Kind of depressing and always smells funky of a mixture between movie popcorn and cleaning chemicals (see my review of Spicy Noodle)..I have to come down here because it's so painfully close to where I live and it has the only Canada Post office (within the Uniprix) within a distance I'd like to walk to. There are some nice little shops down here and of course the Metro grocery store. I just wish they'd Martha Stuart the place and get rid of that smell!
