2	In the end, the sub was relatively tasty, but the customer service (AND SANITATION RATING!) leaves a lot to be desired.Ordered a veggie sub.  The manager asked me what vegetables I wanted.  I'd rad the list, which was posted in front of me, and asked for all of them, minus olives and bell peppers.  He rolled his eyes and said "there are a lot of vegetables, are you sure?"  Why yes, I am... he then asked me individually each vegetable to confirm I did in fact want them on my sandwich.I paid for my meal with a $20. I asked if I could receive two $5s instead of a $10.  The cashier had two $5's in her hand, but Mr. Manager came over, told her that wasn't allowed, and made her give me a $10.  Nobody spoke to me, nobody apologized or said why that was the case, it was just done for me despite my polite request.They have a 92.5 rating, by the way... I wish I'd noticed before I ordered!  I won't be back.
4	Quiznos is amazing- so many levels above subway. This one is pretty good but the lunch kinda is long at 12 and they move slowww. Not much to say about sandwiches, but it's always clean and the food is great.
4	Not a traditional Quiznos regular; but, the facility across street from courthouse is always clean, staff is super nice and the food at a good price point. . .especially considering options nearby.Most other vendors in adjacent areas can't seem to keep the doors open.  One Way next door shut its doors recently, as did the sandwich / breakfast place next to that.Food at Court Cafe is at best mediocre and at worst stomach turning.  Buffett at hotel across street at times good, but you're going to lay out some coin.
