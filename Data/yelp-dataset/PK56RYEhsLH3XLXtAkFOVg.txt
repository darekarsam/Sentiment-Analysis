1	Why only one star? The traffic patterns are horrendous. Accidents happen on a more than normal basis. Cars fly by to get an empty parking space, not stopping if you're backing out of your space. And God forbid if you're trying to get to a store and someone is trying to get to an open space, they'll run you down! Why? Kuhn's, old people love to shop at Kuhn's. You know the type, if it's an old man driving, all you see is the hat, and if it's an old lady all you see is her hands at the ten and two position on the steering wheel. And God love them, they only know one speed, EMPTY SPOT NEAR KUHN'S!!! GUN IT MARTHA!Seriously, the parking lot is bad, but not a bad strip mall. Starbucks, Namaste, PNC Bank, Subway, Whiskey Hollow Grill, Kohli's Indian Market, Super Cuts, Radio Shack and H&R Block are also located here.
1	I am nearly 50 years old and have had 2 fender benders in my life.  One of them was here.  A guy in a van backed into me trying to get away from someone pulling out of a space.  It's not just that the lot is terrible but the drivers around here are awful.  I come here all the time to eat at Namaste or I wouldn't come anywhere near this nightmare of a strip mall.  What a shame.  More poor Pittsburgh area zoning and design.  Too few parking spaces allotted for the business plan and a poorly designed and graded lot.
5	People , Lets not talk about the freekin parking lot ?I Checked out Starbucks Coffee in the Banksville Plaza, And I gotta say , I was impressed.The crew was in perfect sync. very friendly and accommodating. I have to give kuttos to the gal who fetched my coffee and spice cake .....Tall very pretty , Happy , smiling , Sincerely cares about her customers and her job.It would be hard to walk in here with a grumpy attitude.Ohh ,And The Coffee & Cake were good too !
