4	What a great little gem, hidden up in Spring Hill.  Make a terrarium, rainbow bracelet, throw some pottery -- this place has it all for arts and crafts.  Wonderful for kiddos and parents alike.  Would give it 5 stars, but for the somewhat remote location.  :)
4	Great little place with no time limits and lots of fun. Friendly instructors that allow you  to work at your own pace. Great byob for a relaxing night! Loved every minute!
1	DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. We had purchased a groupon for an appointment. It was a very special day--Our one year anniversary. We were already there waiting for her. She called 10 minutes before our appointment and said she had to cancel. It ruined our anniversary. She then told us that we can reschedule for any day after that day. We tried calling again and leaving messages that were not returned asking for the next Saturday. She didn't get back to us until THAT day and told us she can't schedule us until 2 weeks later. So we schedule for two weeks later. THEN on the same day as our appointment, she canceled 1 and a half hours before our appointment!!! Terrible way to run a business!!
