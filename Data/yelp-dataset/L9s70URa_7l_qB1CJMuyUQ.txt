1	I paid 50% down for blinds for my living room on July 5. Two weeks later they came and installed it. It was wrong in many ways. They have come back to "fix" it 5 times since and it is still not right. Now I am requesting them to remove the materials and refund my money and there is no response. I am  now resorting to Amex and my attorney fighting with them. I should have known when Patricia didn't know how to use Excel, didn't know how to process a credit card, and was basically absent for the entire install procedure. I can't ANTI recommend this business enough. Negative 5 stars.
5	Home Impressions is a fabulous company, Patricia is very friendly and strives for perfection in her designing. I love the drapes i got, they are beautiful!! I'm hoping to get a patio cover next!
5	After quotes from 20 different companies I happened to come across this one, I couldn't believe the difference, I was able to upgrade what I wanted to a much better product and still had a budget left over for window tint too. Install was very fast and very professional, give them a call before you waste your time and money elsewhere, you'll thank me when you do
5	I just purchased roman shades for my new home, and I couldn't be happier.  The owner Patricia was knowledgeable, friendly, and patient.   I am very selective and didn't want just anything.  The installer was very knowledgeable, and friendly.
