4	I had a delious chicken filly deluxe sub. Everything is freshly made. The chicken is grilled and very tender and not dried out.
3	Next to villa pizza in the food court. Its always clean and they wear gloves. But quality of meat is average.
4	We had a coupon for this place and decided to give it a try during our shopping trip.  I've never had a Charley's Sub before, so I was excited.  We decided to order:Regular Italian, $5.29http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/charleys-grilled-subs-anthem?select=fZxmXauV9ciNPj8SPisQIQ#fZxmXauV9ciNPj8SPisQIQLarge Italian, $7.39http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/charleys-grilled-subs-anthem?select=I0pt09WSTu4HUys2n5feVw#I0pt09WSTu4HUys2n5feVwFries & Soda, $2.79http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/charleys-grilled-subs-anthem?select=iQxsYTvbpHwvf1wCG8MVbg#iQxsYTvbpHwvf1wCG8MVbgThe Italian Sandwich was very tasty and full of flavor.  The Fries were excellent too...reminds me of the Fries at 5 Guys.  I'll have to look around the Scottsdale area to see if there's a location closer to home.  The meal exceeded my expectations.BTW - There's FREE WiFi available in the food court area where Charley's is located.Return Factor - 80%
5	Spicy Hawaiian Chicken is good. coming back from Grand Canyon, just happen to stop by here for food. and i happened to order this, not knowing the taste, sub, but boy it hit the spot. I was completely satisfied and it was so good~ just the way i like it with a little spiciness and a little sweetness. If i ever pass by this place again, i'll probably stop by again. *My rating is based on Spicy Hawaiian Chicken only.
