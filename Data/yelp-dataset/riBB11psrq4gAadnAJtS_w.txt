5	Shanna was recommended to us by our accountant, and we weren't disappointed. From the very first moment we met with Shanna, we were impressed by her humility, ease to work with, and her attentiveness to our needs. She definitely grasped our wants and desires, and had a firm understanding of our life goals, which is primarily to travel the world. We're looking forward to working with her more, and fostering a professional relationship with her. Just like your doctor or lawyer or accountant, a financial advisor is not one you can just pick overnight, so we're excited to have found someone who gets us. I'll update this review as things move along.
5	Shanna Tingom is an amazing person AND financial advisor! She's positive, responsive, thorough, and ethical. I've referred quite a few clients to her and they've all been very pleased. She's humble and attentive in her approach to her clients' needs. She puts their needs in front of her own. If you live in the East Valley area, Shanna should be your go-to advisor. She also went out of her way to meet w/ one of my clients who lived over an hour away in the west valley! Call her and I know you'll be impressed!
5	Shanna is the best, what can I say!!  She goes above and beyond what your traditional financial advisor would do.  She's personable AND extremely knowledgeable.  I have sent several clients, and my Mom to her and they just love her. She explains things in easy to understand language without making you feel stupid ;-) and she's interested in what YOU need vs trying to sell you something.  You can't go wrong with Shanna!
5	I cannot say enough about how much I love Shanna's financial planning services.  I have had several different advisers throughout the years and Shanna will be the last.  She always makes me feel like I am her only client, and I know that she really cares about the service and advice that she gives me.   I would recommend her to anyone that does not LOVE their current adviser!!
