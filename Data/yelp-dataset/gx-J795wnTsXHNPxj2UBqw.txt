3	I'd rather frequent a small business than a chain so I make it a point to shop here. Tony the owner is a sweetheart and will order anything you ask him for. They have a little bit of everything and are pleasant despite how busy they are from dusk til dawn.
5	No complaints here - the owner gives great suggestions for hookah. They are also well stocked, and I like that they're open long enough for me to grab stuff after work. I also got my hookah here, and we got a great deal for it.
5	Awesome shop. Awesome service! Always has great hookah selection and if he doesn't have something in Stock he will order it for you! Go check it out. You won't be disappointed!
