5	My Grandson attends Journey Education, we love the school. The best part about Journey is that they care for each and every child. The classes are small and the teachers are wonderful. The tuition cost is lower then most private schools in Las Vegas.
5	My daughter attends Journey and we couldn't be happier. After having a not so great experience at another private school and paying more than triple the price, we were referred to Journey and are so thankful. The class sizes are small, the children get one on one attention, and it truly feels like a family. Thank you Journey for taking such great care of my daughter.
5	My son has loved Journey and we love it too!! Small classroom size with great individual care. Here you are one if the family!! Highly recommend it!!! Come check it out!!
5	I am a Las Vegas native and a product of the Clark County School District. I wish I could have had the opportunities like these students have. Each student is placed according to skill and ability in each subject instead of just focusing on grade level. Children who need extra help in math or reading can have the individualized attention while still being challenged in their other subjects. Throughout the year these students get involved in community and charitable events. Last year the Leadership class ran a coat and food drive for the homeless, and they are already planning involvement in other service projects for this school year. These children have amazing opportunities to learn courage, compassion, and commitment. They are leaders.
