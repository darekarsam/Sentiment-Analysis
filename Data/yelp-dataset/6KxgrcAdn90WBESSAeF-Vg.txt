4	I'm not a radical enough dude to catch big air and get totally stoked busting out a few moves, but despite my geneal lack of awesomeness, I rather like quite a lot of the t-shirts and trainers on sale in here.I am perhaps a bit of a fish out of water given that I find extreme sports fairly pointless, but the staff never make me feel that way. A good little store and worth a look if you'repassing.
4	If I had to sum up Focus in one word, I'd say it was pretty gnarly. If you're a skater dude then this place is right up your street.They stock skateboards, skater related merchndise including clothes, trainers, hoodies, belts, bags, skateboard stickers and various other accessories.It's a reasonable sized shop and everything is very well stocked and laid out making it easy and pleasant to browse.If you have any friends that are into skating then you can get quirky gifts and accessories in here for reasonable prices. Cool man.
