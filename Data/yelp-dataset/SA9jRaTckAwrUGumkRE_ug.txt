5	my wife and I had our first experience with this dentist yesterday. Everyone was extremely friendly and efficient. The place was very modern , clean, and both of our appointments were kept on time if not a bit early. When I was there I observed an elderly man being treated with extreme patience and care. These people are great and we will be going back.
5	The best dentist office all around that I have ever experienced! All the staff is amazing. I love they're honesty, they give you all your options. Alley, the office manager, knows her job so well, has never misquoted me, so sweet and always remembers me and my family. Both dentist's are so nice and have caused me no pain ever. Even after the meds wear off...No pain ever. Can't say enough good things about this office! :-)
