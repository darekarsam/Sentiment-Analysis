4	From the moment we pulled up the line guys were exceptionally friendly and were very attentive to our needs. The facilities were being cleaned during our stop over but they were more than accommodating. The pilot lounge was very comfortable with a sleep room and several recliners and full Dish Network.They had a couple of crew cars, dodge stratus i think, the one we got smelled a little bit like smoke but who the hell cares?Reasonable fuel prices and cute desk girls make this a complete FBO experience.
5	I've flown in here 4 times on some dinner trips from Chicago.  Some of the best service I have ever gotten from an FBO and the facility is quite nice.  This is one of my favorite places to go for a 100 dollar hamburger run.
