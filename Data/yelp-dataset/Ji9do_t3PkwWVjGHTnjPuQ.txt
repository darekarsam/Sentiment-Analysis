1	I had one of the single worst customer service experiences with the branch manager (Joel Simmons) of this location today which led me to close my checking account with them. The final straw being him defending a policy that they have in place that holds cash deposits made at their ATMs for an outrageous length of time before making the funds available. I had made a cash deposit at one of their ATMs at 1:16AM on October 10th only to find that they chose not to make my funds available until October 14th (as if they need to wait that long to see if cash will clear). To exacerbate the issue, National City's online banking portal stated that the funds were deposited and credited to my account on the morning of October 13th. Later that day, 12 charges were applied to my account which where each then charged $36 each for a total of $412 in overdraft fees. I called to ask them to reverse the fees since I have printed documentation that I clearly was trying to make sure that sufficient funds were in the account by depositing cash. It was clear that Mr. Simmons had no interest in assisting me. All that he wanted to know is when I would be paying the remainder of the negative balance that they had created with their outrageous fees. They have awful policies that screw over their customers, provide misleading information through their online banking portal, and offer terrible customer service. It's best to take your business elsewhere before they screw you too.
5	This bank is now pnc.   The staff and management are great and are very helpful with my complicated business accounts and my personal checking.
5	The tellers are very helpful and patient.  My BF made a major math goof in our joint account.  I had 2 different girls helping me and they were both wonderful and fixed everything....even the stuff that was his fault!  Thanks ladies!
