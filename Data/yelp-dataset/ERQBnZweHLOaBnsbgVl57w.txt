5	One of Charlotte's finest consignment stores, along with a friendly staff to go with it!  Wonderful things to be found inside this quaint space in the heart of "South End".  Art, furniture, accessories, lighting, and special finds are throughout.  And....if YOU have  personal items to sell, it is the perfect place to consign.
5	Wonderful store - friendly and knowledgeable staff and a wide selection of merchandise for your home! I found a ton of unique items that I bought and will be back for more!
5	This store is very nice and has some great furniture and housing decorations. Unlike other consignment shops, everything here seemed to be reasonably priced.  I would highly recommend anyone in the market for unique furniture/decorations to check out New to You.
5	I couldn't believe this place was a consignment store when I walked in. Unique pieces- most things look like new!
5	I buy a lot of high end furniture at Consignment Stores. I was referred by a friend to New To You Consignment. Absolutely love the place. Th owners and staff are top quality  professionals. Great pieces in the store. I did spend a small fortune for some very expensive pieces. Meaning I got a wonderful price on it all. This is my favorite place for high end high quality merchandise great deals with professional service and knowledge. Highly recommend. Better than 5 stars.
