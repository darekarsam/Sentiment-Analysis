3	Specials 9-11. Otherwise, expensive. Good atmosphere tho.

3	If you don't know what you're getting into when you go to Station Square - well, I can't help you. Ha!  Barroom is exactly what it should be IMO.  Sticky, loud and lots of fun if you've had enough to drink. Otherwise, I suggest an evening of fine wines at the Grand Concourse across the street :-)I visited Barroom for a friend's 30th birthday this past Saturday.  I was the DD, so needless to say, it was not as fun as it might've been. But again, I realize that my sobriety was likely the cause.  I still had a blast dancing amongst the ten bachelorette parties and Pittsburgh's finest s*uts in attendance (but WHERE was the Silver Fox or Pittsburgh Pete?!).  Plus, the ability to go in between Barroom, Saddleridge and that new Beach place - I forget the name - is a welcome bonus.  It's certainly no Matrix or Tequila Willies, but WHAT IS?!
1	YUCK. This place is the worst! Horrendous staff, not even a clean atmosphere. Only way anyone could enjoy this would be if they were 19 years old & just ecstatic to be allowed in an alcohol serving establishment.
4	Out of all the dance clubs in the little three-way connection, I would probably have to call this one my favorite.  It might be just the kind of music they play and the fact they have a dance floor where the people are actually doing some normal dancing that turns me on for it.  Once again, you have the same perks of going in between all three bars once you enter.
