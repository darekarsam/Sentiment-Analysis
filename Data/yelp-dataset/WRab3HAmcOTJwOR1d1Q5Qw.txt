3	Nice lunch. Came for a business meeting and had some enjoyable calamari and Penne all'Arrabbiata washed down with some nice wine and a shortcake desert. Nothing out of the ordinary though.
5	I had veal tortellini. My friend had fish. Appetizers inclu
4	Let me first say we were walking from our hotel by the restaurant and had intentions of having a nice family dinner at Rueben's on St Catherine.  My wife and I are huge supporters of small Italian restaurants that serve fresh flavorful Italian food and have a nice warm "chaleuruse" feeling.  Let me declare that CBLM has done a wonderful job in this regard.I ordered the Seafood Fettuccine. It was offered in a red sauce or light (natural sauce). I chose the natural sauce. It had a wonderful medley of shrimp, clams, mussels, calimari. It was prepared in a light amount of garlic and was really tasty!  My wife ordered the small plate version of Penne Arribiatta and daughters shared a regular regular spaghetti meat sauce.  Wife mentioned the Arribiatta was very good, not wonderful, not bad and daughters were very happy with the spaghetti! When I was finishing my dish one of the chefs asked if I would like some more. I clearly thanked him but said it was fine. Rarely am I offered this! Wow! The restaurant is a bit on the smaller side but this made it more cosy. We had a wonderful experience and would definitely return!
3	When ordering, I couldn't decide between penne vodka or Fettuccini Alfredo. The waiter said, "No problem! I can put in a half order of each!". Sounded great. Then I got the bill and realized he failed to mention it would be $7 extra for this.... Also I never once received a refill on my water which was my only beverage. Once we received our food, the waiter never came back until he brought the bill. The food was very good but service was not.
