4	I've attended one event at Thomson House and helped to organize another. Both times the staff have been friendly, helpful and very professional, the facilities are attractive and clean and the food is very tasty. The Ball Room is excellent for speaker events and receptions - it's where I've attended both events. I've also eaten in the restaurant on the first floor, they do a pretty decent burger. Definitely my favourite venue for events at McGill.
3	We typically take Friday speakers in our department out to lunch here. The restaurant food is very good with a diverse, ever changing menu. In terms of the bar I would give this 1 star. I've been to many grad student run bars and all except Thomson house serve beer AT or near cost. I really don't understand how beer is so expensive here. Don't the grad students working know how much grad students make? Been to a few events here and staff is always mean and short. Try to keep us from bringing in booze. How do you expect us not to do that when you charge so much for beer?
4	I've been to several events here over the years and I always love the warm atmosphere. The large banquet hall is a great event space, with the doorways opening into the central bar area. Windows look out over downtown giving it a certain feeling of looking down over Montreal and having a great time.What I'm not so crazy about are drink prices. They are on par with fancy downtown bars, which doesn't seem quite right for a grad student bar located near the top of a hill. I'm not expecting rock bottom prices either, just middle of the road with perhaps a few specials.  $7 for a pint of nothing fancy is not a good deal.
1	Pretty weird vibes, honestly wish the beer was more expensive :( will be back soon for the great service thanks "rosa" (if that is you're real name)
