5	I don't think there is enough I can say about DSFP.  They made my experience the most comfortable it could possibly be.  Everyone I talked to was supportive, kind and genuinely seemed to care about my health.  Dr. Taylor is so sweet and is always smiling.  Even down to the nurses, especially the one that held my hand, the care I received was outstanding.  Even if they didn't take my insurance, I'd still continue to come here.  Please, anyone who isn't sure about what can be such a dark time, I promise you will find a light in this place.
5	I absolutely adore the staff at this office. They are warm, friendly, and caring. Getting a well woman exam is far less painful when you have a fantastic support system and staff.  I highly recommend this office.
5	No one talks about their OBGYN- well they should, especially when they are this good!  Hands down the best experience I have ever had for a well woman's exam.  Without giving details, a normally cold and invasive procedure, literally became warm and friendly.  I felt like I was with a close friend that cared, not a stranger just doing their job.  All the staff was kind and friendly.  I would highly suggest this place for ANY and EVERY woman!
5	I saw Dr Livingston today to get on birth control. She is amazing! I loved her and her staff. From the moment you walked in everyone was so warm and friendly. I would definately recommend comming to this office .
