3	There's not too much you can say about a pharmacy so I'll keep it brief.  The pharmacists are nice but I wouldn't go so far as saying friendly, they hardly crack a smile.  What makes me happy is that they're really good at getting my prescriptions done within about 10-15 minutes of when I drop it off so I don't have to wait too long.

1	This is the worst pharmacy. They constantly lie to the customers. They lose Rx.... They alter the time they receive Rx. When my doctor faxed refill, they lied and said that they are waiting for the doctor to approve. They fill wrong Rx. These people have no business working in a pharmacy. They are playing with people's lives.
