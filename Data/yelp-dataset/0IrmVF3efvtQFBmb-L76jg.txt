5	Great Service. Friendly staff. I loved the prices and treatments. They will do good. Highly recommended
5	Right when I walked in, I felt comfortable. Camille sat me down, took some Visia photos of my face and talked to me about my problem areas.  She recommended I just have 2 IPLs based on my concerns. She made me feel very comfortable while I was getting an IPL on my face. I felt somewhat relaxed, I know that's hard to do when you're having a laser zapping your face. I will definately go back for more! Thanks Camille!
5	Love Love Love. Lynn is always great and very professional. Love the prices. I will return for sure!!!!
