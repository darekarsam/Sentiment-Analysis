2	We went here to have a Christmas night with a group.Bar prices were ok but the barmaid was a bit ditsy with the order and kept asking what we ordered!Food, "Meh I've experienced FAR better".  Don't come here if you like your food.  I won't be coming back.  it was edible but i could go the extra mile and it would be sensational!  I bit into a "sausage" and it wasn't appealing - the quality was water.  The mossaka was eh not a tad on my sister in laws which is proper greek and now I want some of her to make me feel better.The Dj was shouty, very shouty with the microphone.  thank goodness for my hearing aids as i could turn down the shouty ness!!Toilets were a sorry state.  With 2, yes 2 functions on the same floor you would think the priority was to have all toilets on working order.  with one out of order and toilet rolls at the sink getting wet.  it's a small space for ladies to washhands and dry them and try and get out.I been here once before for a wedding reception and can't remember it being that bad.  I won't be recommending the food from now on, it would be shameful if i did.The seating arrangements were comfortable and the dance floor was big enough, hence 2 stars.  Meh, I've defo experienced better - hence the early departure!
