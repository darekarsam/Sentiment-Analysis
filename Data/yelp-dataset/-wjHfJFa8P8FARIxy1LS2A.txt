5	These ladies are very nice and helpful.
5	I just went here recently and had a great experience. The ladies were very nice and helpful and made you feel taken care of. I needed new glasses and they had so many to choose from. They both helped pick out glasses for me after hearing my taste. As someone who hates how she looks in glasses they were able to help me find glasses I actually like. It was a very easy and painless visit. I will definitely continue to use them. They also offered many discounts on glasses and contacts.
