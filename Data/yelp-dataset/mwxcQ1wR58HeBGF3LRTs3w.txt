3	I had the veggie pita. It was ok. The small amount of vegetables in it were a little undercooked, but I still finished it. Definitely "A-OK," but I'm not sure if I'm a fan quite yet.
5	Living in Waxhaw, we would eat at Greco Fresh Grille in Blakeney when it was convenientl  Since they have just recently opened up in Wesley Chapel ..right next to Hickory Tavern, it's very convenient.The place has a very fresh decor, simply done.. and not overdone.  Still have 'semi-service' as I call it.  Order at the register and they bring the food to you.  Being a huge fan of Lamb.. I got a burger with Lemon and Oregano fries.. All fantastic.  Especially the fries..!!. worth going just for the fries IMHO of course.  Got side of Tzatski sauce with the fries.. and it is equaly as good.  The owner said they just opened the doors quietly a week ago, but everything went smooth, and it was also quite busy.  We'll be back often for sure.  Great addition to the food choices for residents in Wesley Chapel; WXW; Weddington NC.
5	Went today for lunch. Great meal that left us asking ourselves "Why did we wait so long to try it"? Clean location and friendly staff. I got the chicken gyro and the wife got the falafel. Both were excellent. We also got the side of tzatziki that was perfectly made. Will most definitely be back for more.
5	Ate at their Blakeney location so glad they open this location closer to home. Greek gyros are amazing. Prices very fair staff friendly and clean. Love this place. Highly recommend this to everyone.
5	Very happy to have this gem open a new location in Wesley Chapel. Lamb and chicken Gyros are to die for!
