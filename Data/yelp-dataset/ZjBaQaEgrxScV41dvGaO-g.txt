1	After seeing Winchells voted as top Donut shop in Las Vegas I was excited to try them. First of all this is not a Winchells it's a Subway, so that should have been my first warning,Then they had an extremely limited selection at 8am on a Saturday. Got Jelly filled and chocolate nut glazed. These are baked donuts a major fail and they may want to add sugar to the donut part of the donut. Jelly was half filled, which was more than expected. Maybe the Winchells where they make the donuts is good. But this place was a major fail for Saturday morning Donuts, Should have gone to Krispy Kreme.
5	Winchell's does not appeal to Starbucks snobs who choose to dissect any little thing that gets between them and their $8.00 latte enemas.  Just good doughnuts, plain and simple. Yes it is connected with a Subway.... well.... WHO CARES! Two great spots together, not that's American! So, if you need some good doughnuts in a convenient location then this place fits the bill. If you are a robotic Starbucks snob who needs an outlet to plug in your life blood and rub shoulders with other liberals reading the "I'm so esoteric" section of the NY Times then this place will not be up your alley. Just goosestep over to your soul's purpose: $8.00 tar sold as coffee and an outlet and internet access so you can get back to your online "real life."
