5	I have been in construction for many years and my body has suffered. I have received deep tissue and therapeutic massage, I instantly felt comfort and since have much better feeling in my legs and lower back. I highly recommend this company.
5	For months I had been suffering pain in my neck, shoulder and chest which my doctor said (after many tests) was caused by stress and anxiety. One of the treatments my doctor suggested had been massage but I didn't like the idea of going to a strange place for a massage. One day a friend heard my troubles and recommended Serenity Touch. He told me about the mobile service which sounded like a good idea so I called and made an appointment. My therapist showed up on time, the table was clean and comfortable and the massage I received was absolutely fantastic. My therapist worked areas that I didn't even realize where causing me pain but as the massage continued I could feel the tension connecting the places where I was hurting.  The next morning all of my pain was virtually gone and stayed away for almost a week and even then it only returned gradually. Since then I've been calling for appointments when ever I start feeling pain again and I've noticed that it's taking longer for my pain to return after each session. Thank you Serenity Touch!
5	Chey is one of the best CMT's I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. When I first met her I thought, "There's no way this tiny woman will do anything worthy of praising." I WAS WRONG! She's amazing! She knows exactly what to do to relax your muscles and make you feel absolutely amazing! Her coordinator, Chris, is very professional too. Their prices are great for the massage as well. All around, I give Serenity Touch a 5/5!
