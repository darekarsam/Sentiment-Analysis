5	It seems crazy to give a fast food restaurant a five yeah I know... But when everything always comes out fresh and just how you ordered it what else do they deserve?!? This can only be guaranteed when Thomas is working "the night shift" lol he's the best manager ever!! He actually gives a .... : )
5	Great service and the food is prepared for every order instead of sitting out like most fast food places. The manager is friendly and the place is clean.
5	First time ever eating At A Jack In the Box, I really like their burgers.Only problem really in this location was that my drink was not cold unless I put Ice in it, Now everywhere else I got my drink without ice and it was cold. I like how they have A value menu due to I never order A combo meal anymore, I would say this Location Is A go, just one downside but overall it was great!
