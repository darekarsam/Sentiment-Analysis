5	Casey and his team were efficient, smooth, friendly and professional during each stage of our interior painting job.  We are so happy with how our home has become more warm, comfortable, and inviting (not to mention the more peaceful atmosphere that seems to pervade our house) with our now, more colorful home.  All this, and the job was completed right on time.  Can't thank you enough Casey, Don and Jose and team!  Way to go.
5	Casey and his team were great to work with from start to finish!  Loved seeing the computerized color choices.  The crew was professional, polite, timely and best of all spoke fluent English!  I would highly recommend them!
5	I called five contractors to paint our house.  Two didn't respond.  Of the three that did, Casey was easily the most professional and provided the most detailed information.  The price was also very competitive.  Great job, great clean-up.  Our house looks so much better as we had the outside walls painted as well. Everything was as promised.
