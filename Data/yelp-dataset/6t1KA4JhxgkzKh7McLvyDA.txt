4	A good addition to Surprise shopping.
5	Way back in October I commented about the snow bird factor and now that it's July, that's no longer an issue. Stein Mart is one of my favorite stores and isn't as pricey as I thought. The "deals" are toward the back of the store while the "boutique" part of the store is right up front. The staff are very nice and much more relaxed now that they've had a chance to settle in and aren't overwhelmed by snowbirds. As the 2013 snow bird season approaches, I hope that the staff will be better prepared and newbies to Stein Mart will have a better experience than I initially did. :)
5	I love this store!! it's a really great alternative to the other big names.I find that the service is more personal that the aforementioned stores because it is smaller.
