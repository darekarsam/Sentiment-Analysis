5	I work across the street at Xtreme Manufacturing and my shipping department uses this port for all last minute shipments. The staff is awesome!
1	I would give UPS zero stars if that were an option. Three packages were supposed to be delivered to my apartment TWO WEEKS AGO.One of the packages was delivered to the correct address. For some reason, the UPS driver decided to drop my other two packages off at another location.I have called UPS FOUR TIMES and have received minimal assistance. In fact, one employee requested that I go to pick up the package myself! (I happily would if it meant that I never had to deal with UPS Customer Service ever again.)TWICE I have been told that the packages would be retrieved and delivered to the proper location. This has yet to happen. Further, I was told that the local office would contact me. Still no word.I am more than disappointed with the quality of service and will never trust UPS with any package again.
1	the guy sending me a package forgot to put the apartment number.  however, the address given only has 4 residences all in one building.  driver decides that is too much work and leaves.  i call in to ups 5 minutes after he leaves only to be told they cant communicate with the driver.  so later tonight i can go across town and pick my package up.  i sure will and never, never, never again will UPS receive a dime from me.  Wow, talk about lazy, uncaring customer service.
