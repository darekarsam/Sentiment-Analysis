3	This isnt a hugely remarkable coffee shop - it has a few great points, such as it is well located near the university and it has very nice staff, but generally other than that, its just a bit standard. The coffee isnt bad, even if sometimes its a bit too strong - and Saboristo serves a few snacky foods, but nothing to write home about really.Generally, this place is good, if a bit unmemorable for me.
3	I had lunch in Saborsito only a few days ago, and whilst it was tasty and well-priced, the menu wasn't the most extensive and the whole place just seems to be lacking in atmosphere.  It's popuar with the students from the nearby George Square and so it must be doing something right.  The staff are friendly and unusually quick to process tour order.  I had a cheese and ham toastie with a cup of coffee which was pretty nice, but not the most filling lunch I've ever had.  They do, however, have have a good range of delicious coffees which are all ethically sourced and expertly ground.  I just had their standard latte and it was great.  Saborsito, with a bit of livening up, could be turned into first rate cafe.

This is not a taco, it's a burrito. Well, after a failed outing to Illegal Jack's (grossly overseasoned meat, bad ingredients bleh) I decided to try Saborsito.The ingredients are delicious, the food is affordable and it's filling. Grant it, they use white rice and they don't have fajita beef, but it works. If you're looking for a replacement to Chipotle or Freebirds, this may be your best bet in Edinburgh.Inexpensive, quick and tasty. Can't beat it! Their hours are a bit limited.
