5	I recently had to have an emergency root canal done at 6 1/2 months pregnant and everything went flawless!  I was in a lot of pain and while being pregnant did not want to take any medication.  Dr. Walker got me in right away and did an excellent job!  He was able to reassure me of the safety of the procedure and went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable. I was very pleased with the quality of work and would recommend Dr. Walker to anyone.  If he can calm a frantic pregnant lady in pain I am certain he is one of the best professionals out there.
5	On a motorcycle trip and far from home I suddenly had a severe toothache. I went to a Dentist and because the tooth had a crown and a previous root canal he referred me to Endodontic Specialist Dr Stephen Walker. He brought me right in listening attentively as I described the pain. He then examined my mouth and took Xrays. After showing me the Xray and explaining what had to be done Dr Walker performed apico surgery. This involved cutting my gum and sealing the tooth from the inside. 4 days later he took the stitches out. The whole proceedure was quick and painless. It saved my vacation, thank you Dr Walker.
5	Hello - Ok look - no BS - I dreaded having a root canal and the angst my night before was very high!  However other than some minor feeling of pain with the anesthetic shot at first, the rest of the procedure was easy and I continued to work for the rest of the day. That evening and the next day I had no pain or problems.  Dr. Walker and his Staff made me feel relaxed and kept me informed as to the steps of the procedure.  I won't state I look forward to my next root canal, but if I do need one in the future I will have no fear or trepidation about it now.  Sincerely - they really do care.  Jeff H, Mesa
