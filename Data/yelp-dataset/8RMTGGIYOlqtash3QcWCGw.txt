4	A reasonably priced pumpkin patch with a good selection of pumpkins and rides.  Free mini pumpkin with a wristband(20.00)
2	They only have a small selection of pumpkins, they mostly have rides and carnival games. The employees or volunteers are very rude, to actually pay I stood there for about 10 minutes while the ladies behind the counter just talked about how they had a long day or so. As for the carnival games, we asked how many tickets it is, the girl replies "it doesn't take tickets, it takes money" (direct quote) so how much is it? "Depends which one you want"After dealing with such terrible service, I just picked out my pumpkins and left. Their prices are affordable, got two medium-large pumpkins for $23 not bad, compared to other pumpkin patches
5	Super cute rides for the little ones, and the best part is mom or dad are free! It was 3 tickets for the first ride my daughter went on, so I handed the ride operator 6, enough for both of us. He gave me back 3, said parents were free. What a nice surprise! The entire place was clean, and there were just enough rides and games to keep us busy for about 2 hours. The concessions were great, too. We went on a Tuesday night, so there were no lines, and it was nice and cool out. Affordable and fun! (Tickets were $1 each, and rides were 3 tickets on average. Family packs also available at a discount)
