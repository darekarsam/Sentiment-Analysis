4	The atmosphere leaves much to be desired. Its kinda dark and it was really cold inside when I went. I hope they will spruce the place up since it seems to be doing well - every time I drive by the tiny parking lot is packed. I went straight for the gyro and got a basic gyro sandwich since I wasn't super hungry, but I could have split this with my dining companions. We all ended up ordering the same thing and taking half of it home. Portion sizes are very generous. And the chips that came with the sandwich - I am not a big chip person, but I loved these chips and took the extras home with me.Looking forward to going back and trying some of the other things on the menu!
4	Good variance of Grecian fare. I love avgolemono (a creamy, chicken-lemon soup) and theirs is the best I've had. I had a platter with gyro meat, grape leaves, mousakka and pasticia. All of them were delightful and served with warm pita and a generous dollop of tsatziki sauce. This was out first time at this place, and we'll be back.
