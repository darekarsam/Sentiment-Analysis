5	There are so many GREAT things about Lesley and her company!  I've had the chance to try a dozen of the different bakery items she has created, including cakes and cake balls, and everything she offers is simply scrumptious! I've never seen her flower creations in person, only in pictures, but they are quite lovely.Last but most certainly not least, the breakfast she serves is spectacular! I've had the chance to hold a couple of business group meetings there, and both times, everything on the menu was delicious!  If you love bruschetta, you absolutely have to try hers!
5	I ordered a birthday cake for my boyfriend at the last minute. I found an image online that I wanted (guinness cake...yes, the beer) and asked if they could make that on such short notice. Not only did they make it, it was early and it was DELICIOUS. Seriously good. I've also had a few different flavors of the cake balls...omg. They are melt in your mouth fab. Do yourself a favor and check out Lesley's.
5	Love this place.  A great place for breakfast but the cakes are amazing, and real buttercream if you choose buttercream.  Growing up in the Midwest and having a grandfather as a dairyman my grandmother threw a stick of butter in everything.  She lived until she was 83.  So much for they theory it's bad for you.  I can taste the real deal on first bite.  Not margarine, not shortening but butta real butta.....the melt in your moth savor every bite kind.  Great for birthday cakes, wedding cakes, corporate events,  any given Tuesday...let me see yes any reason to have cake.  Like I say in my description more of a sweetie than a foodie.  I just found out that they rent the restaurant for private events.  She has the entire restaurant for YOUR private event.I would say 30 - 50 people?
2	Her cakes are ok, but her lack of customer service is not. She's very snappy and can be rude. I would not recommend her to anyone. We had her do our wedding cake and an anniversary cake 1 year later.
