1	It's 11:30 at night went to check into the hotel after a long 6 hour drive an was denied a hotel room because I dot have a credit card. I explained to to him I had more than enough cash an he questioned me as to why I had so much an told me he couldn't do anything WILL NEVER be staying at a comfort inn ever again
4	Arizona mills is only 5 miles away.  free breakfast. swimming pool.  everything is in short distance.  rooms are cozy and comfy.  but one problem. they close the pool and the mini gym too early.  there free water tastes nasty. and the gym is too small.  only 3 machines. come on guys we need atleast 10.  people like working out now in days.   but other than that. the price is good for the stay.
2	Overall nice facility/lobby/breakfast area; ample parking.  When I checked in, my room had no TV remote. Minor oversight.  I got one at the front desk.  The batteries were nearly drained, though, and died quietly during my second night.  Then I went to iron my clothes, and the iron was missing!  Minor oversight?  I got a new one out of the box at the front desk, but upon use, it would not even heat hot enough to burn my hand.  I tried three outlets in the room, but it made no difference.  Not wanting to make a third trip to the front desk, I made do as best I could.The second night, my WiFi died.  I tried to reconnect, reboot, but only got the warning "Limited Access" when I tried to connect. Either the bandwidth was used up, the router failed, or some other issue arose.  The staff was courteous, but that doesn't make up for the inconveniences.  Three strikes and you're out, UnComfortable Inn.
