4	Come on the right day and you can get a seriously smoking deal.
1	If there was a way to give negative stars, I would. I have had Identity theft happen through this store. The store claims I bought a washer and dryer and everything, def have not purchased anything. I have copies of the papers they accepted with a supposed family members signature then forged my own signature. WHen I call to get this fixed, there is no urgency or call backs. They don't even trust their employees with sensitive info from people's sale forms. NOT A GOOD BUSINESS!
5	Fantastic customer service, friendly staff, and an overall excellent shopping experience. Great price on a Maytag Freezer/Fridge. Even though I didn't mention a Craigslist advertisement, I was still told about the special online pricing and given that price. $35 delivery is a steal and the service was professional and on-time. Highly recommend.
5	Highly recommend scratch and dent.  Bought a washer dryer and a stainless steel frig three years ago and still working great.  I received an awesome deal and experience  some of the best customer service.   They had to replace my washer  because of simple fix came back next day no problem.   I really wanted the one matching my dryer so they came back again after fixing first washer and replaced it.  The delivery guys were very professional and hooked everything up for me.    Melissa made sure I was extremely happy and would definitely buy again from again.  Before you go spend too much money you should check them out.   I searched alot before going here andI would off ended up buying my refrigerator elsewhere for double what I spentt
