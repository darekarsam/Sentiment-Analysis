3	I needed just a quick eye exam for my contact prescription and this place satisfied that need.  The least expensive of what I could find in a 10 mile radius as I wasn't willing to spend a ton.  The staff was disorganized but friendly.  Overall, for my basic needs they were great.  They seemed to have a huge selection of glasses but I didn't browse.
1	Wondering if the two pair deal is too good to be true?  It is.  I went in on a Thursday afternoon.  Two people were working and there was only one other customer in the store.  One employee greeted me and then returned to he desk to play on his cell phone.  I shopped for about a half hour trying on frames and finally left because no one would help me.  The moral of the story: no one will help you if you are standing by the $79 frames.
