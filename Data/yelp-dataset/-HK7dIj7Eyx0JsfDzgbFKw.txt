4	Yes it's fast food, but that doesn't mean you won't be able to taste something exquisite. For a dollar, you get two tacos that are like nothing else you will find (now I see what all the fuss is about). But if you really want to try something that you weren't expecting to be unbelievable, you'll want to try their Spring Rolls. I recommend getting the three pack because these are the best spring rolls money can buy. They're perfectly crunchy on the outside, and the most moist feeling I've ever had in a spring roll.
4	I am a really big fan of Jack in the Box. We didn't have any when I lived in Hampton Roads and I am currently in Springfield and don't know of any around me. So, I was happy to see they were everywhere in Charlotte. This location had a great burger as always, awesome pizza bites that my wife enjoyed, a great chicken sandwhich and the churros.... love the churros. I am kind of glad I don't live right by on or I would be huge but when I happen to be around one, I stop in. I am happy that this location delivered on the goods. Next time I will try the tacos!
4	As far as fast food is concerned...I'm a fan of Jack in the Box.  The burgers are always great.  Sure they're like 10 zillion calories...but that's the byproduct of tasting great. I also love that you can get to tacos for a buck. You heard that right...a buck...and no they're not authentic...but they're a buck...and not bad at all.I'm not generally a fast food lover...but I have yet to have something I didn't like from Jack in the box.  Just ask my belly...or look at it.

1	My husband ate a burger here on Saturday evening, November 16, 2013 and subsequently became sick with gastroenteritis a few hours later. We are wondering if anyone else has had this experience around this date and time. Please be careful what you eat and please if you work somewhere handling food, wash your hands regularly.
