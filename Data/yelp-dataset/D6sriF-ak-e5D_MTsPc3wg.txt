3	Usually a bit pricey for me but ordered the Farmhouse salad with roasted turkey and lt. Italian dressing at $4.99. Let me tell you that is a delicious salad and under 300 cal. with light dressing; can't go wrong. A bit slow getting it but that's due to them making it fresh.
1	There's a reason no one goes here. Service is horrible. Even with only 1 other person in the store the staff acts like their overwhelmed. How this location is still in business is some type of weird paradox. Don't bother to stop. You have been warned.
4	Visit this location several times before.Food was fresh, prepared quickly. Service was friendly and helpful.Dinning room...all the tables were dirty.Food better than the normal burger chain so understand the slightly higher price.Will come back
