5	This is the most amazing shop! It's like stepping into a treasure trove. Jewellery from places all over the world with so many different colours of stones you're spoilt for choice. The most unique jewellery I have seen in Scotland with artifacts and gifts from all over the world.The staff give you personal service, and helped me choose the perfect necklace for my wedding outfit.A must to see !!!
4	'Oooh. Aaah. Shiny things.'Galerie Mirages provoked this reaction in me with it's huge display of beautiful jewellery, trinkets and ornaments. I'm a sucker for cute little ornaments and spent a good while ogling their elephants, birds, everything...It's all wonderful, trust me! If you're on a budget for a gift, they've got a wide variety of prices from cheaper little trinkets to more expensive jewellery pieces. I had to show some serious restraint, leaving with only a regal blue clip-on peacock! (Which looks marvelous clipped to the ornate gold mirror in my room!) Now go see shiny things!
