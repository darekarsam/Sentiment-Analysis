4	Pizza Hut's lunchtime buffet might have been a rare treat at high school, but nowadays it's just too much hassle. Fighting with proles and lardarses over the last bit of pepperoni is a hassle I can do without when I've got a deskload of soul destroying monotony to get through as soon as I leave. Inevitably I'd end up stuck with a few slices of margahrita / veggie "surprise", and a bitter taste in my mouth not entirely down to the e-coli ridden cheese.It's popularity amongst screaming kids and Lidl shoppers means a sit down experience isn't great here at the best of times to be honest, but despite it's obvious, and numerous flaws, there's no denying the pizzas are fantastic in their own way. A greasy, saturated fat-laden Meat Feast won't do you any harm once in a while. Probably.
4	This pizza hut restaurant has had a make over and is shiney shiney new.  I like the booths and free salad bar as well as the self service drinks.  They now have syrups that you can add to your drinks like cherry syrup to add to your lemonade, it is nice.These guys know their stuff and do a mean pizza. I even got a little doggy bag to take my extra slices that I couldn't eat home with me.  Is it wrong to admit that I had them as a packed lunch the following day?  Really helpful waiting staff.
