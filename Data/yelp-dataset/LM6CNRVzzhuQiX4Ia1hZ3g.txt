2	even though this place is conveniently close for me, it waws a huge disspointment.. I was getting a full set put on for the my girlfriends bar hopping birthday extravaganza and i never really have had somebody make my fingers bleed until I went there... the lady was so rough on the edges of my nails the skin was bleeding! omg.. the lady was nice, the full set was a little pricey compared to other places.. definately not worth $35 to have bloody fingers. take your money elsewhere.

2	I've been to many nail salons and this one was definitely on the not-so-good list.  To start the atmosphere was a little sparse and somewhat dirty looking.  I got a mani pedi both done by the same woman (I believe her name was Tina.)  She started my pedicure and asked if I would like the pumice which I thought was included as it is in many pedicures at other salons.  After she put the gel all over my foot she then proceded to tell me it was five dollars extra.  The pumice rock was one that was sitting at the bottom a shower caddy that looked like it had not been disinfected in quite a few uses.  She was going through the motions so half hartedly that she was scrubbing my foot so hard and ended up leaving little paper cut like scratches on the arches of both my feet.  She didn't say anything else to me the entire time.  She also answered her cell phone seven times throught my visit and proceeded to hold the phone on her shoulder and talk while doing both my pedicure and manicure.  When she was finished she just got up and walked over and started with a new costumer without saying anything.  The paint job was actually pretty decent but if your looking to for a salon with good costumer service this is not the place for you!
