5	This is by far the BEST Drum shop i've ever been too! Great selection of everything, especially Cymbals! Also the owner & staff were extremely helpful. Skins & Tin Drum Shop is probably the best Drum shop from St. Louis and Chicago! I'll definately be back!
5	Best drum shop between Chicago and Memphis! I stop by anytime I'm in town. Excellent selection and service.
5	Amazing drum shop! I lucked out and found this while working in Champaign. Stacked from floor to ceiling and wall to wall with new and unique cymbals and a myriad of drum gear. If they don't have it (unlikely) they will get it.
5	Skins N Tins is everything a good drum shop should be. It's small, but packed with gear and cymbals. They always have something interesting in there--you get the impression that the owners are gear heads like the rest of us (I KNOW Terry is--love talkin shop with that dude!). Pounce on their awesome cymbal sale in November! EDIT: Sale now is just all the time! So pounce on their awesome cymbal deals at all times!!
