1	Poor customer service. Told me to go to another dunkins for what I wanted. I drove here from Laveen!
3	This place was neither bad nor great.  It was just ok.  Staffed with one person in the middle of the day.  The guy behind the counter was a little bit slow.  But, for a location in a gas station, I didn't expect much.  I'd hope they have someone better working the morning rush.  The donuts are still the best.  I can't stand Krispy Kream.
5	Every time I go they are  friendly and get my order correct. When it does get crowded they work hard to get everyone order in a timely manner.
