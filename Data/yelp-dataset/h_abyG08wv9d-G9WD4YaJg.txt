5	I bought Altrient C after hearing huge hype about the product from one of my best friends from college.  She told me she had not been sick in a while and that I should try it  When I later researched the product, I also found articles online that talked about how a woman who won the title of the 7th Fittest Women in the World used the product to train.  Since I am not a fan of orange juice and do not eat as many fruits as I should this product works well for me.  I've never felt better and have been recommending the supplement to my friends ever since.
5	I just started taking Altrient C and already, I feel and look healthier. One noticeable change I have seen is in my skin tone and texture. It feels healthier and looks younger. After reading some of the studies on Vitamin C I found that Vitamin C helps to synthesize collagen. I love the product so far and will be using it frequently.
