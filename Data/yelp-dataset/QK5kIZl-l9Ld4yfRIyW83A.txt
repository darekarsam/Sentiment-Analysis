5	My daughter and I had mani/pedis here today. I got gel polish and she had a design done her nails. They did a fantastic job!  Everyone was super nice. Would definitely go again.
5	I went here with my mom for two deluxe spa pedicures and it was really nice. The staff was friendly and the environment was welcoming. It's kind of hard to notice at first within Westgate, but it was a great experience and I definitely recommend it!
5	There was no wait for 3 of us to get manis and pedis. Their names escape me, but the technicians were so friendly and willing to do whatever needed to make sure we were comfortable and satisfied. The options for their services are excellent, and the places was clean! I will definitely be returning.
5	This place is awesome! The chairs are totally unique and have this great air pressure feature that is so cool! My friend and I went in for two pedicures and I got a manicure as well. The pedicures were so relaxing and the tubs (along with everything else) were super clean. We were there close to closing, but Henry and his team did not rush! He took his time with my nails and they turned out amazing!!!!! I will definitely be coming back to this place!
5	Had a really great experience here. Came in on a Monday morning and they were able to see me right away. The guy who did my nails was very nice and spoke good English- it was nice to not have a huge language barrier. He did a great job on my gel manicure. Would come back.
