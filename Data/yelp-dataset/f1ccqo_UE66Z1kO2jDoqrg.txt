1	We had a great initial meeting, but things started to turn for the worst at install. The net is incredibly cumbersome, and the installers did not even want to demo the complete remove/put on process at my house because of this. I told the installer that I was really concerned about how long it took and how much work it was... and that I was starting to have doubts. He told me to just leave the net half-off of the pool so that it would be easier to secure. I tried this and with the net half-way in the pool underwater it felt less safe than no net at all. Upon removal I noticed that the roller had a safety sticker recommending that the net was always completely off or on, to avoid entanglement issues. My husband and I gave the net a week... we really wanted it to work out, but found it was so much work that the net did not make it back on the pool after a swim (at least 20 mins in the 100+ heat while my child(ren) waits... no thanks. We called the company exactly 8 days later for a return. They scoffed and said that they have never had a situation where someone wants to return. That there was nothing they could do for me. Now I am stuck with an $1800 net I will not use. So disappointed in the customer service.
5	We were very happy with installation process, training from the installers, the look of the net and video.  We will be teaching our adult children to install the net so we all know how to keep our grandchildren and pets safe.
5	I've come to rely on the reviews of other users... So I want to come back and put in a review for the katchakid net that I bought six years ago when my first child was born. My two kids, ages four and six and I take our net off/put it on in @ 3 minutes... We set the timer to see how fast we can do it! Kind of a fun, family game as part of our swimming routine! It is not a hamper to our weekend swimming! And just as I wanted. It provides a high level safety barrier without hampering the views from Our patio. I'm a big fan!
