4	Great place for lunch.  I've only had the General Tso's chicken and it is consistently good.  Minor complaint....the music.
4	This place is really small (5 tables total) and it's your typical little chinese restaurant with your typical food choices. I stopped in for lunch and got the orange chicken combo for around $5. I was actually impressed. It was good flavor and I'm completely full. The chicken was descent quality and cooked well. (Some little chinese place over cook the day lights out their food) You won't find many drink choices either. (6 total pepsi products)
1	tiny little place, lunch took 25 minutes to come out, the rice was yellow, not brown, not fried rice, the chicken was awful, i would say DO NOT go here. We were very unhappy.
3	Pretty A=ok takeout Chinese.Its better than some in the area, they do their basic dishes well, my wife liked their egg drop soup. Egg rolls are good. Overall, good, but again, nothing but generic Chinese, don't expect anything else. Fried rice was better than some, with actual veggies in it (peas & carrots).You can tell they don't put a lot of love in their food, with basic care of ingredients, chicken being way over cooked, and some mushy vegetables. Not disappointing one bit though, did not expect much out of s strip mall Chinese with neon signs, and did not get much. Other than a hot, filling meal, while being convenient to Harris Teeter. Otherwise I would have gone to the opposite side of the plaza to PoppySeeds, but I needed to get away from their bacon, egg & cheese, I am addicted.
3	Ehhhhhh. So-So. Very nice and accurate meals. But food tasted a bit artificial and thrown together mechanically.
