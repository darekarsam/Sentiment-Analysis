4	If you're looking for a sub sandwich & you're thinking Subway, then try this place instead. It may be in an odd location & tough to find, but it's worth it.You get some good options for sub choices here & can customize much like at your local Subway. But these subs are filled with so much more meat, cheese, toppings, etc. You get so much more food for your money, not your measly sub that Subway serves up. They also slice the meat right in front of you, meaning a fresher sub.It may be tough to get to, but this location of Sub Station II (& where is Sub Station I?) is worth it for lunch. You'll get a big sub for a good price.
4	Sub Station II is a great place to grab a quick bite if you're handling your business in the Dilworth area. It's a huge upgrade from chain sandwich shops like Quizno's and is far healthier "fast" option than the Bojangles and Chick-Fil-A you'll find everywhere else around town. As Nick points out, you get a considerably larger portion of meat, cheese, and toppings on your sandwiches here, which means a lot. And indeed, the meat is sliced right in front of you, which makes for a fresher and tastier sandwich. They have lots of their selections, but you're welcome to design your own perfect sandwich, which of course is what I did. Try yours with Turkey and Swiss on a roll; add lettuce, tomato, onion, oil and vinegar for the perfect, light lunch or snack. So much better than the crap you'll find elsewhere, trust me.
4	Sub Station II is an a odd location, located among businesses and in the middle of nowhere.  They have some great sandwich options and daily specials.The meat is sliced fresh for each sandwich.  I'd recommend getting a whole sandwich, half for there and half to go.
