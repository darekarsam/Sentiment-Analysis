1	Just because I have tattoos does not mean I don't deserve customer service. I'm not a monster, no need to sneer. Shame too because I was prepared to spend money here. Looks like they had a nice variety of fabrics. No problem, I'll find another shop.
1	If I could give this place zero stars I would. They may have a nice selection of fabric, but their customer service is absolutely horrible! I keep coming back to the place due to their selection, but after today's experience I refuse to ever step foot back into this store again. I was walking up to the store, one of the ladies working was outside setting up a display, she walked back into the store and closed the door in my face. I ignored it. I walk in and none of the the ladies greeted me with a "hello" or "welcome," which I find rude. I immediately go to the selection of the banners, and the same lady that closed the door in my face, came back to the area that I and another lady were at. She asks the other lady if she needed any help. She didn't even acknowledge me, ask me if I needed anything and wouldn't make eye contact with me.I notice that they definitely treat the older generation a lot differently than they do the younger generation. Oh well! I guess they lost another customer!
