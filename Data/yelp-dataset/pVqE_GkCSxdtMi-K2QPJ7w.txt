5	Great bar for happy hours. $1.00 drafts and $2.00 wells from 3-6. Also half priced appetizers. Thursdays are $20.00 matchplay!
4	I would have to say this is one of the best bars by the Air Force Base.  Good food drinks are well priced and it's a mellow environment.  I would really recommend this place.
3	Chips and salsa are amazing. Food is good. Fresh. Was disappointed to recieve fish tacos with fried fish in a restaurant of this caliber.
5	Another great night with Mitch and Ciara. Pulled pork sliders and tall bue moons.  Price is right and the food is  good and people are great.
1	Never been so disrespected in my life, I'm a repeat customer but I guess that doesn't mean anything because we don't tip? but last time I was there I didn't even receive my side of fries such a simple order but yet nothing, so why would I  tip? hell even confronted the bartender about it but she was very rude about it , I even had the receipt ! but I guess receipts dont count?  I've spent hundreds of dollars on their slots before , been going there for 3 years now, you guys say its dirt cheap but i guess my money was not good enough for the bartender, i wish i knew her name but i know its not Ciara she's awesome, i  dont have a problem with stone house i just have a problem with that new bartender .  GET IT TOGETHER
