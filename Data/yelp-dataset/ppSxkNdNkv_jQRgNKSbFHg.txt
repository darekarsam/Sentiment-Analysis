3	This place gets a 3 star because they've never blown my socks off with anything, but I've never had experience with them that made me want to quit pizza. It's pretty close to my house and my nephew loves pizza so I'm here a decent amount. They're very consistent, very friendly and my food is always ready on time. On the single time my order was messed up, they were very quick about fixing it,  which was majorly appreciated. To be honest I have nothing bad to say about them at all. They get the job done
2	I always come here for the wings(carry out) and they always tell me 15 minutes.  You'd think that after the 5th time they made me wait, I'd have this figured out by now.  Wings are great but that is because I always get them fresh because I have to wait additional 10-15 minutes after the allotted wait time.  Just thought I'd let you guys know that if you are ordering carry out, leave your house at 15 minutes and it might be ready when you show up.
5	Always fresh and hot. Service is good . This is our favorite pizza location. What's not to love???
3	They are always busy but know how to handle it! They are pretty efficient getting food out!
