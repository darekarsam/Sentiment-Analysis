4	OMG!!! How has no one ever reviewed this place! This has been a landmark for decades!!!  Open 24/7, the place eastern Montrealers go after a night of debauchery!Though this place is dated, & the waitresses are as old as the hills, I still had to give it a 4 star rating. I guess cause of nostalgia. Oh, and their smoked meat poutine freakin rocks!!The sauce on this poutine is dark, thick and salty! It's old school sauce you can hardly find anymore. I love it, and though they use grated mozzarella instead of curd cheese, it just really works.Then add on the moist, juicy smoked meat on top and HEAVEN ON EARTH. The other things to try are the smoked meat pizza and the midnight specials, huge burgers on kaiser buns, and wraps with a side of poutine. This place is a dive but one of those good old fashion dives we can't help but love.Try it out, let me know what you think.

5	Awesome!!! Best smoke meat in Montreal!!! Try the Poutine Jarry Poutine!!! It's to die For !!! Service is great!!!! $$$$ is good & open 24/24
3	The food is okay but nothing to write home about.  The main appeal of this place is that it's open 24 hours so it's a good place to go after you've been drinking all night for a dose of greasy food.  There is also a special on the smoked meat the first Tuesday of every month.
4	Went to this spot on a recommendation from my boss.  Even though it's far from downtown, it's open 24 hours and getting their smoked meat platter and special Jarry poutine, it's to die for.  My only gripe is that it looks dated and the coleslaw I had wasn't too great but that a pretty minor, will hit this place up more often when I visit Montreal.
