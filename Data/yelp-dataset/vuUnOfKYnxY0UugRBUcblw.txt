5	I worked with Rick Schweikert to sell my row house. The house itself was not worth much and was located in a less desirable area. Coldwell required a minimum commission before taking on this house. Even so, Rick worked diligently to market and sell the house. I felt he really went above and beyond the call of duty in marketing the house. For example, when showings slowed down, he picked up the phone and called every rehab specialist in his rolodex to see if there would be interest. I was really happy to that he found a buyer and closed the sale in just over 30 days. He even got the Coldwell broker to reduce the minimum commission in order to get our deal done.I would absolutely recommend Rick.
5	We recently worked with Linda Corcoran with the Squirrel Hill branch of Coldwell Banker.  Linda was wonderful to work with - she was very responsive; understood the market; helped us price our house for quick sale; and found a buyer in a week and a half.  She was also very helpful and reassuring during the inspections by the buyer and she even was kind enough to come over and unlock the door for me when I was accidently locked out - and she got there in 10 minutes!  I think Linda is a great realtor and you will get a knowledgeable, reasonable, understanding, and pleasant human being to work with if you hire her.
