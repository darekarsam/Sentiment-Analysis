4	A very nice traditional French bakerie & deli. They have fresh baguette, rolls, desserts, cold case with cheeses, pates, and duck confit. We got a very nice cheese and spinach quiche. They boxed it up with string. Great customer service and wonderful quality.
5	The raspberry pastry is so good I let the lady behind the counter slap me to wake me up.  The chocolate croissant and regular croissants are great too.
2	This place has been around forever. I have tried it again recently and it was underwhelming to say the least. Some easy to do pastries were fine, but their "Mille-feuille" was really not that great.
5	Wow! Everything looks amazing here. After a heart wrenching 10 minutes, I settled on some kind of almond Danish. It didn't disappoint. Fell apart in my mouth. Flakey and gooy at the same time, and surely fantastically fattening. But totally worth it. I want to eat many, many more, but I'm in Montreal and that means I gotta leave room for poutine too.
4	I visited this bakery during a recent (and first ever!) trip to Montreal.  It was located down the street from our hotel, so I walked over pretty much as soon as we checked in.  I brought back a chocolate croissant, a chocolate 'opera' pastry as well as a bag of hard candies.  The pastries were delicate and and tasted as delicious as they looked.  When I return to Montreal, I will definitely stop by before leaving!
