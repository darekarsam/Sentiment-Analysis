4	This seemingly small cafe has a great selection for wraps and has a cute room in the back to chill out in and forget the possibly greyness of the city.The people who run it are always super friendly to me as well and I love their choices of food for a quick lunch. There is usually new art decorating the brightly painted walls as well. Space is very limited, and you will be lucky to get an armchair at lunch times, but take away is still a great option with the Meadows being close. Sadly they aren't open on Sundays.
4	Coffee Etc is one of those places that whenever I walk past it it is always full, with a queue that is almost out of the door. While I have always taken this to be a good sign, up unti now I have never been in as I am pretty impatient and can never be bothered to wait. I did however, wait recently and to be honest, I'm really glad I did. The food was excellent - its mainly wraps, but they have some amazing fillings on offer - so that wait in the queue isnt wasted, in fact it might even be a good thing while you choose from the huge selection of fillings. Once you have gotten your wrap, there are a few little chairs and tables to eat at, but being so busy all the time its unlikely you will get one.
4	Coffee Etc. is a great little cafe and although I haven't tried the fabulous sounding wraps that the other reviewers have mentioned I have popped in for a cup of tea and a wee sit down although after reading the other reviews the first thing on my list next time is to get one of those wraps.I guess I must come at the right times as whenever I've been I haven't had to wait in a queue and have always managed to get a seat too. The staff are always really friendly too and who can complain when you're receiving service with a smile?
