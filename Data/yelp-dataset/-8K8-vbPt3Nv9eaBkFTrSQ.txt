1	Ghetto unfabulous.I may be somewhat of a princess, but the dirty, itchy bedsheet/grungy furniture/sticky bathroom floor/insufficient water pressure/paper thin walls as in you can hear every source of sound coming from the hallway 1-2-3-4-5 punch combo would drive all of you away from ever staying here again too!Let's just say that more than just the fitness center needs remodeling.  Atleast the staff tries hard to be friendly and accomodating.
1	Quite possibly the worst hotel I've ever had the misfortune to stay in. One wonders if anyone has ever cleaned anything in this hotel. Sticky carpets, stained everything, water damage, half painted walls, cobwebs everywhere, you get the point. Staff is quite friendly but generally unhelpful. Almost any hotel in the area would be better than this.
1	So dirty I was afraid to take my shoes off. Is there a way to give a quarter star?
