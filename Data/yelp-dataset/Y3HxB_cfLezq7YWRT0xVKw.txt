5	These folks try harder, and they are professional and fair and their products have helped my husband with his pain and cancer symptoms.
5	This is my favorite of only two dispensaries I go to in the Valley (and I frequent this one much more). The quality of their meds tops anyone else's - believe me, I've shopped around when I first got my card. Prices are about the same, sometimes lower than a few of the dispensaries and the quality is so much better. Other places have the same prices on their meds, but have lots of trim or are in those horrible pre-packaged zip lock bags. They're awesome at trimming and only carrying quality medicine! I love their deals - sampler specials, check-in for a free pre-roll, 20% off edibles, etc. I suggest following them on leafly!The budtenders are awesome and friendly, actually pay attention to you and try to help pick out what's best for you. Love you guys!
5	Quick and easy! I researched beforehand what strains were available here. I walked in, signed in, smelled the jar of white rhino, and purchased that along with kandy kush, as I had a buy one 1/8, get one free coupon from Arizona Green Life. The office is tidy and professional. Behind a locked door lies the dispensary's contents, with a long, clean display case. All the jars are clearly labeled, and the cannabaristas are congenial. There is a security guard who hovers quietly in the background. This dispensary offers a point accumulation program, so the more you buy, the more you get free.The white rhino worked well for my pain (spine and nerve related), but the kandy kush took the cake. Very calming, pain relieving, and helped me sleep like a babe.
