3	The service has improved over time.   Post Office boxes are still the rule in Carefree, so we do the walk of shame every 2 weeks when we pick up the mail.   Take the yellow card out of the box and walk to the line to join all the others that are picking up the mail.
4	Friendly, hometown feel and greetings from employees.  Efficient and always able to help.  I like that we can now pick up shipments there and track shipments.
