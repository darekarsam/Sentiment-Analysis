5	I have been a very happy home owner of using Aqua Health Pool Service for the last 2 years. Oscar as the owner is straightforward and very professional in all pool related services he and his crew members have provided - simply a peace of mind when it comes to quality of work in maintaining the pool for many years the family can enjoy without worry. Oscar often keeps his client informed about the pool conditions and whether a must-have preventative care is required - he never sells anything that's just nice-to-have. Do yourself a favor to retain Oscar Health Pool Service to maintain your lovely pool - you will appreciate the choice you make just like what I did two years ago:-)

I was so happy with the service & advice Oscar the owner of the company gave me. Oscar is a very courteous & knows his stuff. He went above and beyond to help me out & explain the pool system to me.I highly recommend this pool company & with be referring Oscar to all my friendsOne very happy customerJeremy Cullan
1	I have found this service to be reliable but their fees for everything are high and they take liberal "vacations" for which you are still charged.  They even charged me a cleaning fee for the day they had the pool drained to acid wash it.  Several times they showed up in the dark to clean the pool????  I would not recommend this company.
