5	Bagels! I prefer Einstein over the other guys (you know who I'm talking about!). Their fare is the same as all the other locations, what sets this one apart is the staff. They are all extremely nice and accommodating and always up for a little chit chat while our food is being prepared. If you are in the mood for some bagels head on over!
5	This is a LOVELY little breakfast/lunch shop!! Small, but a cozy atmosphere and friendly service! The smell is beyond enticing as you walk by.After much debating (which the employees patiently waited on), I chose the new Tuscan bagel littered with delicious herbs/seasoning and topped with the sun-dried tomato cream cheese - highly recommend!!! 'twas a savory and delicious experience.They have a great hot coffee selection (4 delicious flavors, 1 being decaf). I mixed the vanilla hazelnut with the dark roast and added all of their spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla & cocoa) and a splash of milk (they have skim, 2% & half-and-half). For a small bottomless cup, it was only $1.79 plus tax!  I got the bagel free because I joined their rewards club.  Perfect way to start my day!! You shall not be disappointed by their broad selection of wonderful treats & such.  I would love to try their lunch bagel sandwiches!
5	Soft, made to order bagels. Great low-fat smoothies. Staff is always nice and patient with my gazillion order changes. There's so many great choices! They also have texting sign-ups and I get free coffee and bagels with my orders all the time.
1	There's nothing about this specific location that is bad.  It's the Einstein Bagels food itself.  I got a Santa Fe Egg wrap, and I don't understand how they can use the term "egg" in the name.  There's no way in hell that slimy yellow gelatin came from a chicken!   Absolutely horrible.
