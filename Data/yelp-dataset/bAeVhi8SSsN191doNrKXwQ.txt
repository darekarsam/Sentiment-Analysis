2	So this is your basic CVS - but 2 things I noticed here today.  1. prices seem to be way more expensive than your average drug store2. maybe it was just because it was friday morning - but they seems to be out of lots of things today - I would say 1/2 of the coolers were empty too.
4	This pertains to the actual pharmacy, not the store as a whole. The pharmacy staff are always kind, cordial professionals. I've been using this pharmacy for about 10 years and the pharmacists have stayed the same. While the staff of techs may change - possibly due to their being pharmacy school students - the turnover rate is low. My experience has always been that the staff are respectful and friendly, and I have observed them treat other people that way as well. The lead pharmacist seems to be a good role model for the people who work for him.
2	just your ordinary CVS with everything bumped up in price due to Convenience . i live about 2 blocks away... so i head here for a Brisk Tea or some t.p , nothing more.I am, however, excited about the new SUPER CVS that they are building 2 blocks up on Centre Ave & Craig Street. It's going to be 24hours and hopefully a little bigger. This CVS holds all of the things, but there is no proper area for a line. You're just stuck standing there, moving every time someone walks in.  I'm going to assume that's one thing they will change at the new one because it does get hectic and a weird snake line drags through the store. Anyways I'm pretty sure that the employee said the new one should be open around November and this CVS will transfer to there and no longer be open (obviously) .. maybe the new one will knock my socks off and get more stars :)
4	This is not Closed.  They moved across the street on the corner of Centre and Craig. The new building is opened 24/7
