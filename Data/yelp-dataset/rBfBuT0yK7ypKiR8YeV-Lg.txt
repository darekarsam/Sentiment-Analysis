5	Best place in da 'burgh for the frequent traveler!
1	I have purchased many high end pieces of luggage (Tumi, Briggs & Riley) from this location with the understanding that they are adding value to my purchase over that of online or airport retailers should I need a repair as they are certainly not less expensive.  Well One of my B&R bags is in need of repair.  The bag was purchased Dec-2012 so it is not that old and it is indeed covered under the lifetime repair of B&R.   I stopped in today to see what could be done.  They could not repair the bag and did offer to send the bag back to B&R for me for the small fee of $35+tax. Really, I could walk down the road a bit and have the UPS store ship it for half that price.  What value are they providing me?   It is a shame that the brick and mortar stores are unable to provide value over online and this is one easy way to do it.  A Shame since I used to be a really good customer.
