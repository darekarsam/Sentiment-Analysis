2	This place does so-so to the max. CSC boasts convenience over value. Over-priced, small portions, mediocre service. Don't go here to get just a side of bacon in the morning--it's too expensive for the few slices you receive. The breakfast croissant is good, but standard. Lunch is equally unmemorable. It's frustrating, because I work in the building and some times I'm too lazy to walk the 2 blocks to Burger King in the morning for a "proper" breakfast. I guess I get what I deserve for lack of motivation.
3	This place is the only place downtown that I know of that serves several drinks with boba, which I am a huge fan off.When you need a break from more commercial coffee shops and don't want the conventional break room coffee, I splurge here...hahaFor $2.50 you get medium size Thai iced coffee with boba, I think this is a good deal.As far as the food goes, I've only had their breakfast sandwich and for $2.50 you get what you pay for. Nothing memorable but not completely atrocious.The customer service is minimal but then again it's not speed dating...though they recognize your face! HaOverall, I would recommend this place for the convenience and their Boba beverages!Cheers!
4	Had a delicious turkey sandwich on rye and a fruit salad that was very fresh and good.  Very friendly, quidk service as I head back to work from my gym.  Also the prices were a bit lower than some of the other sandwich shops nearby.
