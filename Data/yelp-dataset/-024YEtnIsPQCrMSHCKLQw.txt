2	Immediate knockdown of a star for being a chain coffee shop that doesn't offer free wifi.  So there.I stopped here to avoid a rainstorm that caught me without an umbrella and I thought it would be nice to grab a yoghurt, cappuccino, and get a bit of work done whilst I waited.  Mango yoghurt parfait was too sugary, cappuccino was more like a latte, and work was limited to offline stuff since I'm too cheap to pay the $4 for 30 minutes.  Especially since the rain stopped and I was out of there in 10 anyway.

5	I think this was the best breakfast that I have ever had on vacation. My friend and I wandered downtown and well, nothing was open. It seems like everything starts up around 11am. This place though boasted that it was open 24 hours. I was somewhat reluctant because, let's face it, 24 hour places usually stink. I was so wrong though. The breakfast was cooked fresh and enormous. Eggs over easy, salad with dressing, toast with peanut butter, bacon, potatoes and several different fruits plus a freshly brewed cup of coffee. Wow! I looked in their display cases and they had huge sandwiches and yummy looking desserts. Wifi was free and they had computers you could use. They are cash only but have an ATM right by the entrance. The employees were nice and the place was packed- it must be the go to place for people who are hungry and up before 11. I definitely recommend it!
