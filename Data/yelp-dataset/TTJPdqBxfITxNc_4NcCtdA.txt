4	This is a great little neighborhood place. The coffee is great and is made the way it is made in Italy. They have a variety of pastries and a huge assortment of imported Italian goodies. I haven't tried the hot chocolate yet but it looks absolutely decadent. It's become my go to place in the neighborhood.

5	Great Italian cafe. The friendly couple who own it are more than helpful. Great quality coffee and pastries! A very nice addition to Monkland!
5	Great coffee shop in Monkland village. Always make a point to stop by whenever I walk by :)
5	I fell in love with this cafe as soon as I entered the place. I like the TV playing, the cozy atmosphere, it is really like being in your living room except you're drinking a fabulous latte and you have a whole range of typical Italian pastries to choose from. I recommend the sfogliatella : it's heaven in your mouth. The staff is cool and despite the fact that the room is small, it's still very comfortable. A jewel on Monkland!! Will return for sure!!!
