4	Seems like it's a new location. Everything is always clean and presentable. The new kitchen area is dope for on the go food from a gas station. Plenty to choose from wether snacks or drinks. This is close to my house so I get to always fill up here.
5	This is my favorite Q.T ! Not o ly is it right by my house and has the new style kitchen inside . But also has a appropriate size parking lot and space to move around . Also theres only 2 ways in the backside which used to be a strip mall that has recently 99% closed down so there's no traffic and the Cactus light, which compared to other Q.Ts that are around the I 17 is amazing .
