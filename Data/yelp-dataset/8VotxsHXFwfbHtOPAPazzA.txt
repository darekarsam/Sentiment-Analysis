3	Friendly and efficient
4	I had to use the services of the occupational health center as part of new hire exam for a newly acquired job. The staff was nice and friendly and the wait time was relatively short. I did have to come back a second time due to a test being inconclusive which is no fault of the clinics at all. I would say the service was consistent. I would recommend this place to others if they needed occupational health services.
1	Horrible experience, I literally got kicked out by the Dr. I had to wait an hour and the dr wouldn't see me cause my kids were there and being kids. I had no problems in California they got me in and out for my workers comp. I get penalized cause I have kids, office staff is rude and a new girl up front didn't even schedule my appt that I had she just looked like a deer in headlights the whole time. Very un organized. Smelled like an ash tray in there.
1	Worst clinic I have ever been to we arrived at 930 appt was at 10 its now after 12 and were still waiting staff doesnt seem to care we were 2nd in the room 5 people showed up after and are called before us this place is ran horribly
5	Just left this health center great experience. Everyone is so nice and they try there best to get you in and out quickly!!! Make it easy for first time clients. I will definitely be coming back if I need anything else done or checked
