5	Holly and Richard did my Grooms cake for my December 8, 2013 wedding and perfection doesn't even come close to what we were given!! They are truly artists at what they do!! They are worth every penny and even delivered our cake to the venue! They will definitely be our go-to cake artists for as long as we live!
5	Bakery was recommended by a friend. Wow did they deliver! We had our daughters 1st communion and they made her cake. The cake design was awesome and the cake was delicious?
5	I looked high and low for a company that would not only make my husband and me a beautiful wedding cake with the specifics we wanted, but would also cater to our dietary restrictions. When I called and spoke with Richard from Cake Azure, he told me that not only would they accommodate me being vegan and gluten-free, but that I should look online to see what they've created. I did and was extremely impressed. I told Richard exactly what we wanted and he said that Holly, the cake artist, could accommodate me without any problems. We went to their cake tasting and I really liked the gluten-free vegan white cake with fruit filling. We opted to have the wedding cake "regular" but would do the top tier gluten-free vegan for our anniversary and a sheet cake in the kitchen for the wedding. I then asked my groom to leave the meeting so that I could talk to Richard and Holly about a surprise grooms cake.When we saw the cakes on our wedding day, we were extremely impressed. The wedding cake was exactly as I had envisioned and the guitar grooms cake was exact! The cakes tasted great also.Cake Azure is reasonable priced, very accommodating, delicious, and extremely creative. I highly recommend them and look forward to using them in the future.
