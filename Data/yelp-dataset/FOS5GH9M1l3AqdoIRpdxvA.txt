1	Thai Express is one of my favourite cheap 'n cheerfuls and after finishing a job in the west island I spotted one as I was heading down St-Jean Boulevard. Upon entering its a really nice looking place, lots of seating, yet for a lunch time it appeared to be rather sparsely populated. I am quite use to Thai Express' level of service, which is "express" level, at most locations you're chowing down before McDonalds has even finished microwaving your burger.I am also use to the Caribbean temporal anomaly called "Island Time" where everything happens in slow motion due to the lack of motivation of the island's inhabitants. Little did I know that Island time also referred to the West Island of Montreal, but it appears to have found its home in this particular stretch of DDO.The first bad omen -- no one is working at the cash. I stood there a good 3 minutes before someone finally meandered over, after placing my order I stood and waited, there was no one cooking anything, and now a few others placed orders after me, still no one manning the wok.Finally after about 10 minutes and being quite hungry and frustrated I asked why there was no one cooking and swear to God, this is what I was told. "The cooks are off having lunch" to which I replied "That's ironic, I'm here for the same reason!"It took me another 5 minutes to get my money back as no one knew how to use the cash register, I then went somewhere else.Funnily enough when I told this to a friend he told me this place is known as a disorganized disaster, and the google review of it pointed out the same.
2	Mediocre Thai food. Go here if you want a cheap meal, but not for much else. I will allow that I didn't try the O'Burger side of the restaurant, but if the burgers look anything like the posters they had up, it was a good call on my part.
1	Too much oil, chicken is covered in batter, you couldn't even taste the chicken.. It's like a regular Chinese food.
