5	The name caught my eye and when I went inside I was not disappointed! Lots of essential oils, candles and beautiful jewelry ! I met the owners and they were so sweet! I think they are very reasonably priced. I will doing my holiday shopping there for sure!
5	I adore Karma Connection! The owners are so nice and informative! Their merchandise  and selection is really growing! They have new jewelry every time I go in!
5	Go to this store first before any others.  I have been to all if not most of the crystal/ metaphysical shops in town and this one stands out.  It just recently opened and I LOVE it.  I do not say love lightly because I am really picky and can be a bit critical, but the flow of the store is great, the woman who was there is great, and the selection is excellent.  This holiday season, I can buy gifts for everyone on my list, even people who are not spiritual! I love this and the prices are the best in town.  The SW needed this business I look forward to watching them grow!
5	I went to this shop and the experience was incredible I loved the jewelry. It was inexpensive and a variety of beautiful pieces. I bought five jewelry candles and they are to die for. The jewelry that came out was incredible. I decided to get a reading from the psychic and she was dead on. I will be visiting very soon.
5	I stopped by to find a special gift for my girl. To my surprise I found the best ring for my baby. She loved it!! I scored and I will be back for my Christmas shopping. I loved the amazing service!!
