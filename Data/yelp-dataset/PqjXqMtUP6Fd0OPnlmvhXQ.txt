1	Horrible service...food being thrown in the kitchen. Order was wrong. No pepper. Bad attitudes from employees. Fails on all counts. Avoid if you can.
1	First time coming here & NEVER coming back. Came here in the afternoon, maybe that's why it wasn't busy. We were helped by Danielle, who didn't look happy that they actually had customers. Anyway, we ordered half a dozen donuts and a coffee. It was obvious our donuts weren't fresh because they were hard and dry. The coffee was just alright, we could've gone to Starbucks or the Human Bean just down the street. Crappy donuts & bad service is probably why they were so dead & explains the other bad review on here.
1	My husband and I stopped in about an hour ago. We ordered some some donuts and and an iced coffee with caramel flavor. I tried the iced coffee and it had no syrup. No big deal I thought I would just ask them for some caramel flavor. I then asked Karesa to fix my drink and she then snatched my drink and rolled her eyes. When she handed my drink back to me she pushed into my hand almost to say "here is this better" in very sarcastic way, to the point the lid almost popped off my cup! I will not be returning to this location, and because of this horrible experience I am just fine paying a little bit more up the street at Starbucks
