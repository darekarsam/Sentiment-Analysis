4	I've only been here once, unfortunately, as I discovered it right before leaving Madison, but hopefully I'll go back someday!The bookstore is large - there seemed to be another room off each room I entered! In the back they had a ton of mysteries, including pre-owned books. I could have spent hours there. The staff was really friendly, too. You can also order things online, which is great when what you're looking for isn't in stock.
5	I had a great time browsing this store.  They had so many books to go through.  This store is really big and around every corner seemed to be another room filled with books.  The store is laid out in an easy to explore manner with all the books clearly organized by subject and author.  If you like browsing through bookstores like I do I would tell you this is a must visit store.
4	Amazing selection, you could spent all day in here, well organized labyrinth and very easy to special order if they don't have what you need in stock! They have a bag check for large bags, which at first seemed annoying but actually is really nice so you don't have to lug around your backpack or large purse while you shop. This place rivals my favorite bookstore in San Francisco,City Lights. I'd go so far as to say it is a local gem!
5	as we enter the museum not imagine how great it is. For those who like abstract art and last names the A Room of One's Own is limited to 3 floors. In the other is only modern art that did not interest me.
