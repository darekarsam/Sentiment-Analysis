5	Jimmy is amazing! amazing artwork with very reasonable prices. He's very patient and never rushes you out. Appointments are necessary but it's never difficult to get a hold of him.
5	First time here today. I love getting my nails done and I'm always on the lookout for new nail designs. Jimmy did a great job and his prices were reasonable. I definitely agree with the other reviews. Call him for an appointment!!
