5	Happy Tails is the best dog boarding that we have ever had. They truly care about the dogs and give the dogs a home environment and treat them like one of the family.
4	Trisha is great! We feel very comfortable leaving our pets with her and we know they are going to be ok.
5	Trish and Sandro are absolutely amazing with my dogs. I heard about them from a family member. I have an older dog, and a dog with behavioral and health issues. They have watched my dogs during out of town trips and have worked with socializing my troubled pet. She has made so much progress since I got her! Thanks to Trish and Sandro and their expert handling (and advice) of my monster! I live about 60 miles from them, but I won't go anywhere else for doggy care.
