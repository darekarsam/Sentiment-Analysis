5	Went here for coffee a few months ago and had a wonderful Chai Latte. I hate when Starbucks makes them too sweet. This one was dead on. Yesterday, I went here for dinner with 3 other people. Warm welcome when we walked in. Front windows were nice and big for sitting in the sun. It is separated into two rooms-The coffee bar and the restaurant. Free Wi-Fi too. Menu is super reasonable. Everything is under $10. I had a Chicken sandwich with thinly sliced green apple and Gouda cheese. It was awesome. The chicken was seasoned just right. Two of my friends got pizza, which I tried a piece of. It was also good. The crust looked like it was cooked in a pizza oven. Fresh dough. My Mom got Pear and Potato soup. Yes....you read that correctly. Odd, but good. Slightly sweet. Would be good cold too. This is a BYO. They charge $2 per stem for wine. You can also bring your own beer, but I'm not sure if they charge for that unless you ask for a glass. It was a slower night. John, one of the owners, came over to our table. He offered me a beer out of his personal stash. Super friendly. I hope to have one of my wine dinners here. Although the hours say they close at 7:00, if you have a large party there for dinner, they will stay open to accommodate you. Also nice to note....they have an outdoor patio area to sit when its nice.  They also have their own BBQ Smoker and make their own pulled pork!
5	Great place for coffee and hanging out with friends. The staff is wonderful and John and Aurelia (the owners) are outgoing and fun. The food is tasty and changes with the season. You have to try the pulled pork. John smokes it himself on Saturday mornings.
3	After taking a 1/2 mile touristy walk to get here, it led me to a residential address. Triple checked. I called their number from two different sources and got 'Paul's' voice mail. Nope, doesn't exist (in the location given at least). Three stars because I've never been.
