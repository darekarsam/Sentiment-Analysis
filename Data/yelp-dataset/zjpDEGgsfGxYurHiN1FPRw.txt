4	Walking down ASU's farmers market I spotted this stand selling Hummus!Looking for a change from Stacy's Pita chips I bought a tub of garlic hummus and garlic pita chips (twice the garlic power)PRETTY DAYUM GOODAnd for about a dollar more per item compared to supermarket generics this is one area I'm willing to splurge on.
5	Every time I visit AJ's, I beeline straight to the dip section and pick up some pita chips and one of the delicious dips (hummus, Vegan jalapeno spinach dip, guac, etc) and I was very excited when I recently went to the Old Town Farmer's Market and got to meet Doctor Hummus in the flesh! Doc Hummus knows how to dip. His pita chips taste like buttery heavenly goodness and I could consume a box in minutes. His dips are fresh full of flavorful. My favorites include the vegan jalapeno spinach dip (it's made with tofu and doesn't taste dairy-free), his guacamole because it's very fresh and has a nice kick to it and of course any one of his hummus dips! I find that his products are less expensive at the Farmer's Market so I encourage anyone who's in the Old Town area to pay the Doc a visit!
