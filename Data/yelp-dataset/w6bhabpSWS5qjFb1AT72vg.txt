2	This place is a poor representation of the Giant Eagle brand.  Small selection, small selection of frozen seafood, very odd layout, very small ethnic goods area.  Good place to people watch, though.
1	Quite possibly the worst Giant Eagle in existence. Super small, carries no vegetarian items, except sad fruits and vegetables that have collected dust for weeks. People seem to come here for lottery tickets and Diet Coke. Those they have.
1	The worst Giant Eagle in all the land.  Poor selection of produce, and anything other than processed, packaged foods.
