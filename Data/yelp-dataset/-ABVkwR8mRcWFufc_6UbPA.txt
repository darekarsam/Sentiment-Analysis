3	What can you say. Who doesn't like B&J?  Only problem here is how much it costs compared to te competition on Monkland.   Because of that it's not my first choice. Service is mediocre, what you'd expect.
5	Can't really complain about great ice cream. Nice kids working behind the counter, with good service in English and French. My double scoop (regular size) ice cream on a cone was $4 and change, which is less than Marble Slab and also less than a Blizzard at Dairy Queen these days.This location is now half the size of what it used to be - it's been carved up and a sushi place (which I haven't tried and therefore can't comment on) has moved in next door. That's fine with me, especially if lower rent means they can stay open and keep serving delicious ice cream.
5	Sometimes, I think this location only hires weirdos. Don't get wrong, they are nice and friendly, but on occasion, it feels like some of the count girls don't hear what I'm saying. Maybe it's noisier on the other side of the counter? Whatever.It doesn't matter really, as long as I get my Liz Lemon or that freakin awesome Coconut 7 Layer Bar (whatever it's called) I'm 100% thrilled. :)
