4	I probably should have read the sign a little better before I went wandering in here, this is a store that sells post mastectomy beauty supplies.  But still with October quickly approaching I'll take it upon myself as a woman and a daughter affected by breast cancer to tell everyone about this place.  They have all kinds of great stuff to help a woman feel good during her recovery.  They have wigs and other hair accessories, even down to swimsuits and everything in between.  The staff is really compassionate as well and can answer any questions.  It was a real learning experience for me, I'm glad I stumbled in.
1	Extremely poor customer service and do not offer the latest innovations in wigs. Maybe they were once the only game in town and are resting on their laurels...if you have breast cancer, the last thing you need is poor service and pushy sales clerks. I would give no stars if that were an option. Stay away.
1	Very pushy! I went with my mother who is fighting cancer , I was shocked at how pushy they were with her. They are taking advantage of cancer patients.
