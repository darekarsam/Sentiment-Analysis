1	Appointments are usually 1-1.5hrs late. There is no direct calling, only voicemails or representatives that say "oh, thats not my department, but you can leave a message for the nurse" or "you need to call back and select option ______" which takes you to a voicemail.... The dozen I have left have never been returned. The documentation I need is never faxed and thus the prescription I got in June remains unfilled. Stay away, I will be.
1	I went to this OBGYN because of the great reviews I found online (or so they were great before I went in.)  I was extremely disappointed.  Dr. Greg Marchand was very awkward and completely unhelpful and the office staff presented terrible communication and were very rude.  Trying to get ahold of billing or the office is a complete nightmare - no one is helpful and no one ever answers or returns phone calls.   I am not one to really review on these websites, but I thought that because I used this method to find a new doctor and was misled, I would try and help future patients.Good luck but totally not recommended.
1	in 2011 this place rocked, in 2013 with my second kid, this place is HORRIBLE! EVERY TIME i made a appt, they said i had the wrong time, thats odd its written on a card you gave me.. this happened at least 4 times! I switched offices because my midwife left, since then they have sent me to collections for a bill i paid, i have called the billing office multiple times, left messages with no return call to resolve the issue. They also are withholding MY RECORDS, my new drs office has requested my records 4 times now again with no response.. This place is a joke!
1	The younger doc was helpful and thorough but that is the only positive thing I can say.
