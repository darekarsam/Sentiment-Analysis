5	Walked in today, sniffed the pizza breeze, saw all them students making my pizza then got to the counter lady to get my pizza. I was expecting to wait a few minutes cause i came in like 5 minutes early, but she said it was ready. Gave my money and got my pizza, easy peezy. Thanks guys! And then I got home... opened the box and my 2 artisan pizzas were gorgeous!
4	After craving cinnamon sticks for about an hour, I decided to cave in and place a delivery order *bye bye diet*. They unfortunately have a minimum order price if like $8.10 or something weird like that for deliveries. Not sure if that's implemented due to a slow season (summer) or what. But I added on Parmesan Bites and a marinara sauce to bring up the price... And saw that ordering a sauce was extra. I'm not sure why they can't just give customers 1 sauce- do they think a seasoned bread ball will not need sauce? Overall amazing quality- yum! Like the good was amazing. Order took only 25minutes to arrive which is really good. I just hate when businesses do things to be cheap, especially in one of the busiest, most profitable areas-UNCC.
