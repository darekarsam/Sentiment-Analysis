5	Went for dinner with friends last month.. Food and service was impeccable... Great value for your money!
3	I wouldn't call the food impeccable, but the service was definitely good. Most of the meat dishes that had been ordered at my table (filet mignon brochette and medaillon filet mignon) were decent, at best. My mom wasn't too pleased with the fact that her filet mignon was wrapped in bacon, which she had only realized after eating 1/2 of her plate. My mom doesn't eat pork. It was hard to tell what it was at first due to the sauce covering most of it, and the menu doesn't mention that anywhere (I believe it should). Others felt as though the filet mignon was rather tasteless and drenched in sauce to compensate for that. I had ordered the chicken brochette with butterfly shrimp. I thought it was pretty good, the chicken was great actually, but the butterfly shrimp was a tad greasy and mushy. The rice needed salt in order to have any taste at all, and the potatoes... same problem.It was a nice sit-down dinner, however not very enjoyable.
