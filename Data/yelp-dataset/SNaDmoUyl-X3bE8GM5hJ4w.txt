4	At my first visit this month, Dr. Radke and her assistants were wonderful. I never had to wait long and most importantly, Radke really addressed my eye allergies (a new phenomenon for me as a recent Wisco resident) and pointed me toward some new contacts that are AMAZINGLY COMFORTABLE!I really like that they offer Optomap as an alternative to dilating your eyes. It isn't covered under insurance but the cost is well worth avoiding dilation eye drops in my book.
4	Honestly, Dr. Radke's recommendation on changing contacts has changed my life! I can make it through the whole day without feeling my contacts, having dry eyes or red eyes - a huge improvement.
4	I've always dreaded going to the optometrist because I have really awful vision, and I usually feel horrible admitting what I can't see. That and I dislike the usual hard sales on glasses and contacts when I know that I can order them online. I saw Dr. Kari Jones, and I thought that she was excellent. She was professional, didn't push me into buying contacts and glasses (unlike the last optometrist I saw at this same location), and she listened to some of my concerns. My family has a history of cataracts, glaucoma, and macular degenaration, and I felt that she did take the time to make sure that my eyes were "healthy." I was considering switching optometrists, but after walking out with a $75 bill, I'm a loyal customer once again. (I've never gotten out of there with less than $275 before, but that was with a 1/2 year's supply of contacts). I deducted one star because I asked her to write out my glass and contact prescription (which optometrists are required to do by law), and she must have forgotten to write out the glass prescription. I'll have to swing by the office one more time if I decide that I need to get updated eyeglasses.
