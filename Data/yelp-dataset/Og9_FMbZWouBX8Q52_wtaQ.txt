5	Great place to go if you love the Irish! The owner was very personable and gave great recommendations for my trip to Ireland. She will also give 20% off if you check in with social media. I bought a beautiful Celtic Irish plate for my mantel for a great price. Love it!
5	Great liitle shop for everything Irish.  The owner, Nancy, was real helpful and nice.   She helped me pick out an awesome pair of trinity knot earings that I needed for a last minute gift.
5	This is the most darling little Irish store! Such a variety of cute things for gifts. Great service and a neat location.
