5	Initially I was worried when I saw the number of menu items offered. Then I understood that this restaurant chose quality over quantity. The food is great, the service perfect and the price seems impossible (appetizer and main dish for 14$ at lunch time). I am curious to find out if the menu is renewed on a regular basis. I will soon find out since this will be my new spot in the neighbourhood.
