3	Service was pretty good but the price changes day by day for the same order
2	What can you say, its a McDonalds. The cliental at this location is sketchy at best. Can't drown out the pure awesomeness by watching the tele because some guy has his home computer set up in the corner & needs both outlets even though he brought his own extension cord with multiple plug-ins. Lots of not so clean people with some health or drug issues rolling around looking ever so pleasant while asking to bum this or that. Not really sure if I'll get or want back what they are asking for (besides the $$$) so I think its best to not entertain their needs.....Surprisingly, my order came out right but my employees didn't. Its like playing taste bud Russian roulette. Your sure happy when you didn't get the bullet! I did however, see a shirt on a guy inline that made my day so I posted it on FB so everyone else can enjoy. Good Times!!
2	Although my order is usually correct and tastes fine, I almost never leave without having had at least one problem. They are always out of what I am trying to order, such as apple pies, iced coffee, and ice cream. It is a huge inconvenience to drive here for something specific to be told no. Also, I haven't had many great experiences with the staff here. Often I will be yelled at through the intercom for not understanding something, or I'll get the silent treatment and death stare at the window. I like to stop by this location for a quick, cheap meal, but I'm not usually impressed when I leave.
