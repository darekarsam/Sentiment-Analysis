5	My dogs are my children. I have switched vets several times because they have not been treated properly in my eyes. Dr. Stickland and Dr. Duregger are absolutely wonderful. Saint is the only word I can think of to describe them. We mostly work with Dr. Stickland and she knows exactly how my two American Bulldogs need to be handled/treated when they are seen here and my dogs even respect her for the way she approaches them. If you aren't already going to this vet you need to switch.
5	Dr. Stickland and all the staff were so helpful and took excellent care of my little Nina. Very happy to have found a new home for my animals. Thank you thank you!
5	Incredibly compassionate and professional staff and doctors. If you are tired of being treated like they don't need your business and don't care about your pets then you need to change to this hospital !
5	Always the best care for the three dogs in our household.  From puppy to end of life experiences would not go any where else. Dr Stickland has been there for us since 2008.
5	Dr. Stickland is the best vet anyone could ask for. She has done two surgeries on my dog and both times everything turned out perfect. She is so caring and very friendly. I highly recommend her to everyone. Keep up the good work.
