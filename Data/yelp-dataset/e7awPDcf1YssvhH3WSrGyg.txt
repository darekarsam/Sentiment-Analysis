5	I have always been responsible when it came to having a child, but sometimes life happens. I was so depressed and ashamed I told no one about this. I went to this clinic alone having no idea about this place or how I would be treated. The day of the operation was scary for me because I was alone and had no one to comfort me or drive me home. Because of this I could not have any sedation during the procedure.  Right before it began I started to cry and the nurse walks over to me and holds my hand. She assures me everything will be okay and she made me feel very comfortable and loved! The doctor was kind gentle and quick. The only pain I felt was slight cramping. I highly recommend this place if any women out there have questions on what to do.
5	The Doctors at Family Planning Associates are very Knowledgeable and compassionate. Dr Stanley made me feel very comfortable, and explained everything to me in detail. The staff was also very nice and understanding. I would 100%recommend them to anyone that was facing an unplanned pregnancy and needed to explore they're options.
5	My OB doctor recommended me to this clinic to have my pregnancy terminated. I did my procedure couple weeks ago and I just did my follow up recently. It was a very hard choice and decision for me and my husband. The doctor and the staff talked me through it. They said that" NO single person wants to be in their clinic and doesn't want to be in that situation. Everybody goes through different life circumstances and we all have different reasons why.. Just by talking to them before the procedure helped me a lot. They were really friendly and makes sure I'm comfortable in their office. Procedure was fast and good. Dr. Was very helpful. And the nurses were there to comfort me. They held my hand and explained everything. Same thing with my follow up appt. I'm really glad I went to this clinic.
