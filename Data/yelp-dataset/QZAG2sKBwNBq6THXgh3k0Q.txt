5	My mother and I had stopped into this store to see of we can get quick centerpieces for my sister's wedding reception. We were on a strict budget as well so we came in to see what we can spring up last minute. To our amazement, Mike, accommodated us and our budget. His arrangements were elegant and breathtaking. I myself underestimated the life that a beautiful floral arrangement can bring to a party.  I am so impressed by not only Mike's talent but his dedication to his customers. I am not going to anyone else but here for my future floral requirements. Thank you Mike for making my sister's wedding even more memorable!
1	Extremely overpriced. I also wouldn't  describe the owner as nice or helpful. Find somewhere else.
5	My boyfriend had bought me a beautiful set of flowers from here, however the next day some of them were already dying :( I called the store to let them know and with no hesitation the owner had me bring them in to get refreshed :)
1	I recently bought my wife an arrangement of Roses from the Flower Garden.  The person who worked at the counter is very Un- friendly,  bordering on rude. I paid over $90 for 13 roses in a vase. After 3 days,  the roses never opened and we're wilting and dead. I took the roses back to the store and the same person was there. She was extremely rude and told my wife and I we didn't know how to take care of roses. She told us we needed to change the water every other day. I have bought my wife roses many times before and I have never been told by anybody to change the water. I was not instructed to do so by this person either. After she told us we didn't know how to take care of the roses,  she took the 13 roses out and replaced them with 6 new roses. She was rude through the whole process. We left, and will never go back to that florist again.
