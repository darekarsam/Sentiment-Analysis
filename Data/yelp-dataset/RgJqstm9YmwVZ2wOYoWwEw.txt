5	I used to live close to this place  This is a really fun local bar with a casual ambience and a small selection of good beers on tap at fair prices which is getting harder and harder to find these days. The decor has a warm feel with wood tables and chairs and the light level usually stays low. A few Tv's are playing sports mosts of the time.It's a fab place just to hang for an afternoon beer in the summer. It's rarely crowded.  On weeknights it's fairly quiet with decent music playing at a decent volume which allows for conversation. At night it gets seriously busy when there's hockey going on as they always play the hockey game (In French- most patrons are Francophone). It's busier on weekends in general but rarely insanely busy in my experience.Fun place - down to earth people and atmosphere.
5	Our favorite dive bar in the Plateau. Good beer on tap for a good price, with super friendly bartenders. Not super busy most nights, but a fun place to go watch hockey or the World Cup. Reasonable volume level and a great place to hangout alone or with friends.
