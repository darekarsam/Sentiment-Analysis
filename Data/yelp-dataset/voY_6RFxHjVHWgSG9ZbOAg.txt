4	Was looking for a quick sushi place that makes the food in front of me, with good combos and takeout options and I found one right next to where I work in Montreal. Excellent. I went for a combo and will do that again in the future. Also the place looks great!
4	This is a review of Sushi Inbox for dine-in lunch (haven't tried takeout). I've been twice and have gotten their lunch specials. They are around $8 for 10 or so pieces of rolls and include miso soup.I think it's a pretty good lunch option near McGill. It was not crowded and was quick. That said, my 4-star rating is grading on this curve. It is not great sushi, but it's a decent value for the area.
5	I'm a regular at this restaurant. I always order Delico and Kamikaze, they are simply the best! Especially Delico, you HAVE to give it a try! I also recommend Novo (cake that's made of eel on rice), also delicious! The price was reasonable, especially if you ordered their lunch special (combo C has kamikaze).
5	One of our favourite sushi spot. The price is very low compare to the quality of food that we were getting. Great service and even greater food! Love their sushi, especially the eel one. Small hidden gem.
