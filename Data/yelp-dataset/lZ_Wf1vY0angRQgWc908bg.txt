4	Not sure why this is listed as closed.  It is very much open!Three floors, interior entrances, elevator, outdoor (seasonal) pool.This is an older Sleep Inn property.  Everything was fine for my one night stay.  Bed was comfortable, wifi signal was strong, room in good order and clean.Breakfast bar had waffles, boiled eggs, cereals, fruits, and pastries.Pleasant staff both at check-in and departure.
2	Thin walls. Rooms with no tubs - just showers. ...Small TV - with no pay -per-view options. ...My room was clean and staff was efficient.
5	We stayed here the weekend of my husband's birthday, when we took a trip with friends for his birthday to hang out for the weekend. In our room, we had 2 double beds and it was plenty enough for what we needed for my hubby and myself, and our daughter! The beds were comfortable. I would have loved a larger bed, however, we were on a budget and time constraint, so we took what we could get, and I was very pleased! The beds were super comfortable, and the staff was very friendly! The breakfast was pretty standard, nothing to rave about, but better than some I have had at hotels before!
