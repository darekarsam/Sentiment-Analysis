5	YUM!My first time visiting Taco Bros last night, and I was not disappointed. Homemade and delicious Mexican food, serving late late late for an amazing price....PERFECTION!My hubby and I shared one order of chimis and a couple of tacos, and it was more than enough food; very generous portions. We had the braised beef chimis and it was so savory, as if the meat had been slow cooked all day. If you ever thought the chicken taco was bland, try Taco Bros jerk chicken taco- we loved it! Nothing bland about it. We also tried the veggie taco and there was nothing boring/bland about that either- I am not a vegetarian myself, but it looks like there is some delicious variety for the vegetarian here :-)   I haven't even mentioned how much we loved the homemade spicy salsas, and the savory rice and beans...I could literally go on and on!To top it all off, we had to have a bit of dessert...the Mexican Crueller- MMMMMM!...hot, fresh and the perfect amount of sweet.Thanks Taco Bros for being committed to QUALITY and TASTE. I will definitely be back!
