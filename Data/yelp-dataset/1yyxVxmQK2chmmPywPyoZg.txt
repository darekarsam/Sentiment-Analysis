4	My Girl loves taking her little puppy to this place for a bath and a nice grooming. The women here do a great job. Her puppy comes out really cleans and all cute with a nice trim. They even gave her a little bandanna wrap around to keep her warm.I recommend you try them out if you live in the area.
4	I have been taking Mojave (8 year old Aussi/Cattle mix) here for at least 5-6 years. The staff is kind, & prices are on target.Mojave always comes out smelling great, her nails trimmed and she always looks stylish in her bandana or bow!There are a ton of groomers much closer to me, however it's worth the extra drive for Mojave to feel comfortable with the ladies she knows. Thanks!
5	Not only do they take good care of my dogs, but, today, I found out that they close in remembrance of the lives lost on September 11, 2001. If ever I questioned whether or not this is the right place with whom to do business, that has stopped.
5	We have been taking our dogs to the Barking Lot for years now. The grooming services are excellent, and the groomers are very friendly and kind to our dogs.
5	I'm so happy and so is my pooch! Denise did a fantastic job! my pup was a bit shaken from his last grooming experience, but Denise took him in his arms right when she saw him and promised he'd be in good hands. She worked wonders and he looked so excited when I picked him up. I love that you can watch the grooming process so you know they aren't hurting or abusing your pet like some places. Very reasonably priced as well. Will be back!
1	They cut my dog's ear badly and charged me full price before they showed me how bad it was. I was told it was a nip at first. After they took my credit card ran it, them they brought her out and told that she was taken to the vet and had to have it super glued. Her cut is a mess, on top of the gash on the top of my babies ear! I posted a photo of her ear to show that this is no "nip".
