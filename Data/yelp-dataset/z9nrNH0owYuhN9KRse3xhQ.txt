4	I went in during their $7.99 haircut special. Due to the haircut being a cheap one, I didn't have very high expectations, but Great Clips proved me wrong! The staff was very friendly and professional, plus they had me in and out within 20 minutes despite the fact that I didn't book an appointment. I'm glad that I took the chance on this place. I mean, who would've believed that you can get a nice haircut for under $10?
1	HORRIBLE !!!!! don't waste your money here ! i went in for a haircut and got out with my hair looking horrible, it's cheap but you pay for what you get. Horrible place. at least this salon.
4	The place I normally get my haircut was closed, so needed to find a place I could get a quick trim in the area I was in. Found this place and before I even sat down in the waiting area, they called my name. Great service and happy with the trim!
5	The lady who did my little boys hair did great! He was a little wiggle worm and a bit of a screamer (his first time) and she handled it wonderfully! Will be back for sure!
1	The first time I came here they did a wonderful job, but this last time? Never again. The lady did the worst job on my sons hair ever, He had huge chunks taken out and his bangs were horribly uneven, still in his eyes! She was acting scared to do his hair because he's young (17 months at the time) which I understand (I'm a dog groomer and groom puppies a lot, which is hard) but I would never send a client home with the chop job this lady gave my kid. And after it was done she popped a lollipop in his mouth, which I had never given my child before and really didn't want to give him candy at this age. Never again.
