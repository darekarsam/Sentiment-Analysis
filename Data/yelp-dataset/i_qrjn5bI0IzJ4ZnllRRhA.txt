1	I would avoid this company at all costs! I had my car towed from one of the rudest tow truck drivers I have ever seen. He charged me over $200 to get my car back on the spot and didn't have extra change -- not even a $10 or $20. Guess what happened? I had to overpay him.After close inspection of my car, I had also noticed very noticeable scratch marks on my shotgun's seat. It looked as if someone had used a crowbar to unlock the car. Of course, this was another $150 fix at the Subaru dealer.There was also a high school girl that had her car towed in front of me. She was in tears because she couldn't afford the expensive fees on the spot. I have no idea why these tow truck drivers did not give her a break. Any sensible human being would have acted differently.Please avoid this company at all costs. I have had experience with much more helpful companies in the Urbana-Champaign area.
1	I called these amateurs to tow someone's car out of my spot, and after waiting 45 minutes for them to show up, they told me that the lot I was in was not in their towing zone. I wish they would have told me that beforehand.
