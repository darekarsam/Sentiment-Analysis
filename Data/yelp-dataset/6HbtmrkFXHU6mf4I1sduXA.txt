4	I've never had a bad experience at this Puma store. The staff has always been friendly and helpful - without being pushy - when I'm there...plus they've always had my shoe size in stock!
4	I am such a Pumaholic. I have been for years now. I love the look and the feel of their shoes. This particular Puma location has a fairly decent selection and the associates are very helpful. I will return.
1	Needed to make a simple purchase. It was 12:08, they were supposed to open at noon, but the doors were still locked & the gentleman behind the counter signaled 5 more minutes. Really? Not greeted when they finally opened & truly the most miserable staff I have experienced in this area. Unfortunately, I will not shop here again.
