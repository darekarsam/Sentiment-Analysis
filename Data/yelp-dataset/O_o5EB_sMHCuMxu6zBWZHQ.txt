5	Great service, great pizza, great specials, great coffee, and great dessert.  Piazetta delivered at this location, as it delivers consistently in each of their locations around Montreal, perfectly cooked pizza and fantastic service along side all the other amenities.  The only criticism I have is the beer selection is seriously lacking.
5	My friends and I were visiting from Boston and chanced upon this place while walking around in the neighborhood. This place is soo good that it really doesn't need any reviews to make it popular. Freshly baked bread, delicious pizzas, and great service. The creole pizza was the highlight of our dinner. Don't miss it. I would totally come back here during my next visit to this beautiful city.
