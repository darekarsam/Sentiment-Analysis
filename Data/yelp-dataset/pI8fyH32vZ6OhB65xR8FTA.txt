5	I had a wonderful, wonderful experience at this office. I had the privilege of Dr. Clark D. Larson helping me with a very unique problem. My crown to my front tooth came off and I lost it. I work in customer service and my hillbilly status was not working for me at all. So this is my unique situation: I was in a car accident years ago where I broke my jaw and the joint on my right side keeps fusing together. It is very rare and very odd. This makes it impossible for me to open my mouth very far at all. Since they are unable to take an impression Dr. Larson had to think outside of the box. He actually made me a tooth from scratch! It took him some time but he made sure he did it right and that it looked good. He did an amazing job and it looks great! They closed at 4 the day I was there and he stayed 30 minutes later to make sure it was perfect. His assistant was wonderful too. We had a great conversation while I was waiting for him to help other patients. I forget her first name but her last name is Pachecho I believe. I strongly recommend taking the drive out to their office, it will be worth your while. Everyone was great!
5	I have driven from Scottsdale to Apache Junction on many occasions to be treated by Dr. Bigler. I have introduced my wife, 2 adult children and my grandson to this practice.. My grandson (8) has this thing against dentists. 3 X he has refused to let other Dentists work on him. (I loved paying those bills!) Dr. Bigler comforted him, got him to open up and even use a needle.  I can not say enough about what a fantastic dental practice this is. It is worth the 40 minute drive!
5	I have always hated going to the dentist, but coming here has changed that! You will not find a kinder, more gentle hygienist in all of Phoenix. Tom is wonderful and all of the doctors are great. They helped me feel safe and comfortable and fully explained all of my questions. When you come to this office, you're family.
