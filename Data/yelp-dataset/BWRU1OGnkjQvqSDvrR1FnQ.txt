4	Great food and good service. It's a new place so nice and clean. It was really busy but our food came out fast and great as always! Close to Ikea and 85!
1	Worst customer service I pick up my food in drive thru the girl at the window had attitude first she gave me the wrong food order & I told her thank you 2 times n she just ignore me what a customer service never going back again
5	Fast and friendly service. Zaxbys has great food and I love it as a concurrent alternative to traditional fast food. I highly recommend Zaxbys as a whole but especially this location
1	Repeat slow service and overly salty food. Each time I have been here the drive thru line is across the parking lot and takes nearly 15 minutes. Do yourself a favor and go to the zaxbys near concord mills mall.
