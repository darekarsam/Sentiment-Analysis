1	Worst. Rude. Horrible quality. All they do is talk crap when u ask them to fix THEIR mistakes. Never go here.
1	Horrible. I wasn't thrilled the first time I went. My gel manicure came out bubbly and started cracking. When I went back a couple weeks later for a polish change, Cindy the Mutilator had me "soak" my fingers in acetone for all of 1 second before she took a dremel to my nails (mind you, my REAL nails, NOT acrylic!) and proceeded to cut the cuticle and skin of six of my fingers. How the other four escaped her wrath, I don't know. Then she had me soak again in acetone and then alcohol - ow, ow, ow! I was in tears. Now here I am with six bleeding phallanges and was still expected to pay full price. Never again! There are hundreds of nail salons out there, DO NOT GO HERE!
1	I actually give it NO stars! But I had to choose at least one. Have been there once. Never going back. Rude and dirty. My friend went there a month ago and got an infection that hasn't gone away yet. Don't go there!
