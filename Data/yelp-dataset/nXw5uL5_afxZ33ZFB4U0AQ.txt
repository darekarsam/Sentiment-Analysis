4	Nice little SAQ. except for this one miserable cashier guy who should probably quit and get on welfare because a cushy government job is apparently too much work to crack a smile or be polite. Decent selection of wine and quite useful since there are a few BYOW in the area.
3	Small SAQ open a bit later than the one in Jean Talon Market around the corner, but with far fewer options. I've found the staff friendly and helpful and if you dig you can find some nice wines and pockets here or there of interesting whiskeys, but this is a small space and inevitably limited.
5	:)the. end.
