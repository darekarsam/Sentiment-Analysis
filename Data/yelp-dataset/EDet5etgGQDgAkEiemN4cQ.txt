2	I've had two experiences with this store - the first was bad, the second was adequate.  I went in to the ATT store about 2 weeks ago to upgrade to the Iphone 4 and join a family plan with a friend.  The sales associate at the time seemed to know what he was doing and set it all up - told us it would take up to 3 days to get the plan together and that he would call us both when it was done.  A week later and no phone call, I went back to the store and talked with another associate who informed me that nothing was done since my first visit and in fact nothing needed to be done, that I could have an Iphone in 20 minutes and sure enough 20 minutes later the plans were set and the numbers were together on a family plan.  Overall the experience wasn't a good one, in that I had to wait an extra week for nothing, and was told misinformation from the start (plus the wait times were an hour one time I stopped in).  I'd suggest another store to upgrade or change plans.
4	I had a good experience at this AT&T store the people were friendly and helped me right away.  I wasn't able to retreive my emails or get on the internet with my new iphone they found out somehow my data plan was gone after updating my phone.  The salesman was able to fix the problem right away and I haven't had a problem since.  Remembering the days where I use to wait hours at the cellular store to fix a problem this was a huge difference I was in and out in just a few minutes.
1	I do not like going into this location. The wait time is always toooooo long. I usually windup calling customer service to have my questions answered and then use the kiosk. Employees seem to be just chatting it up too much while people's precious time is being wasted.
