5	I've used upkeep on my rental and on my own homeAnd they were very accommodating. They worked with my budget and was able to get everything I wanted done.I highly recommend this cleaning company and would use them again.
5	The ladies were prompt and on time. They did everything I asked them to do and so much more...they worked well as a team. My home is simply spotless. They took the time to clean and let chemicals sit on a few stains I had in the tub from hair dye, that I could never seem to get out myself, and now my tub is spotless and back to white. I will definitely be hiring Upkeep again, especially if these two ladies are a representation of the company. In addition to the wonderful job they did, the website to schedule a cleaning made my life so much easier. I was able to list all of the things I wanted them to focus on as well as pick a date and time that was convenient for me and my husband. We highly recommend this cleaning company to you for business or residential.
5	I use the same ladies twice a week. With a new baby and a full time job they have helped me keep my home clean with extra time for my little one. I definitely would recommend Upkeep.
