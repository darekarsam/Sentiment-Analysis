3	This is one of those places that you wouldn't think might be kind of questionable, but is actually pretty nice.  It's right next to a gas station which doesn't help with that image, nor does the parking situation. but once you get inside it has the atmosphere of a neighborhood diner.  The food was very well done, very fresh and tasty.  The chicken club was very good, with the cheese melted all over it.  The only thing that could have really been improved upon was the service.  The girls looked bored and like they didn't really want to be there.  But then again they also looked like they were in high school, and trying to make teenagers happy is a pointless effort.
3	Dont' get me wrong, the chicken is good, but when I go to a straight up fried chicken place right near the hood, I want EPIC.  5 stars compared to KFC.Its on the edge of a strip mall next to a gas station right on sugar creek.  Great location for a drive through window type place, but thats not the case.I went in to buy a BUNCH of chicken for all the wonderful people that had just helped me move.  It took a lot longer than I expected but that was some good fried chicken.  Lots of batter, really crunchy, and juicy chicken inside.Had some cole slaw as a side and yet again, good, but nothing truly special.
4	The fried chicken livers are so tender and good. The chicken is pretty good.This place I need to visit more to try other things on the menu. The lemon cake was moist and tasty. I had inquired about it and when I got home there was a piece of lemon cake in my bag free of charge. The nice lady at the register was nice and friendly.
