4	I really am not a clothes shopper.  But when I have to go and refresh my wardrobe, this is a good place.  Great variety for all ages, well 30 and over.  Very sophisticated styles.  A bit on the pricey side.  The sales accosiates are always very helpful.  I'm not sure the reason why their sizes are set up differently but it works.  I likey.
5	LOVE this store!!!  ESPECIALLY  the staff!!!  GREAT ladies working here and I just had a BALL!!! They seem very focused in assisting you and making sure you are HAPPY with what you buy.  Yes it is a tad pricey but the clearance is fantastic!! I have to say the sweater set (one piece  was on sale the other regular price) I STILL wear!!  GREAT quality and the service is wonderful and the quality of the clothing is really good.  Why run around when you can get something really cool HERE without the madness of the strip??  I'll be back!!
4	What caught my attention in Water Tower Place was the fact that he was the only building to survive the fire that destroyed Las Vegas,in the nineteenth century. Today is a 7-storey office building, which has many shopping options.
