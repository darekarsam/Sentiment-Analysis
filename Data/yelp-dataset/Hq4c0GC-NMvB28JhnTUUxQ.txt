5	Staff always friendly and helpful. You can buy one nut or bolt rather than massive package.

5	Union Hills Ace Hardware is really great.. the staff is knowledgeable and if by chance they dont have an item they will help you by calling another Ace and checking for you.
4	For a local, smaller hardware store they really pack the merchandise in!  Always someone to wait on you and really helpful too.  There is a pretty large assortment of stuff you never knew you needed!  While smaller than a huge mega warehouse I always enjoy going here because of the excellent service and really competitive pricing.  AND it's a quick drive down the street!
4	Normally I would give 3 stars for these typical chain conglomerates. The negative side of Ace Hardware is they are a little pricey, the upside is that they are super friendly and eager to help you find what you need quickly. Since I'm from Wisconsin and I know the value of a good root beer I was pleasantly surprised to find my favorite brand here. Sprecher root beer & other flavors all the way from Wisconsin! Of course I'm going to have to bump the star rating up a notch on this one folks!
