5	Great hotel, nice rooms, very friendly ang helpful staff good breakfast. They really want to make sure your stay is a pleasant one
5	I was impressed as soon as I arrived.  The young man greeted me with a smile and had everything ready for me after they got my last name.  The room is a nice studio with a kitchenette.  It even has a dishwasher if you are eating in. It's in a new part of town with the largest LA Fitness I've ever seen. There's a Thai food place,  burger joint,  and a Peruvian restaurant in the same center. I would definitely recommend staying here if you're in town for business or with the family.
