4	The world-famous Spiegel Tent only exists in Edinburgh during the Fringe, and it's hard to describe exactly what it is. It occupies the George Square Gardens in the centre of the uni campus, so it immediately has lovely surrounding with all the greenery. The first and most obvious of its functions is as a beer garden. Although with it being the festival you do pay stupid amounts for a pint out of a plastic cup, it's worth it here as the atmosphere is always so good. Thats because there's always something going on in the various sideshows and mini theatres dotted around the edge of the square - think Moulin Rouge-esque circus type stalls and shows with all sorts of weird and wonderful things, a little auditorium with twice-daily shows, more portaloos than is really necessary and a huge outdoor pub in the middle of it.Surprisingly, this is a bit of a celebrity magnet. For some reason, I've seen Kevin Spacey here every single time I've come here for a pint and friends have said they've seen various other famous people.It's definitely both weird and wonderful in equal measure, but you can't come to the Fringe and not go to the Spiegeltent.

I'm a creature of habit, of familiar faces (as long as I'm in the same square mile that I've been living in for 4 years) and the Spiegel Tent is just another one of those spaces that gets filled by annoying tourists, which is in turn the reason why people start bumping up prices on anything and everything in the city.But, the Spiegel Tent puts on pretty good shows, so, though the bar isn't a great place to grab a drink, there're always good things to see in the performance space. This year, however, things are going to be shaken up a bit with McSweeney's and the Golden Hour appearing for free shows at the Spiegel. I'm definitely going. You should too.
