4	I went there on the first of Sep. for a dinner with my sister. To be honest, the food was great. Hands down. Exactly as I expected if not better!  However, I didn't give it 5 stars due to the BAD SERVICE I've got! The moment I entered the buffet until I left,  no one came to ask what to drink or if we needed something!! So I had to call the waitress ( who was responsible for our section) to order drinks!! So she just brought them with no excuse! Our Glasses of water were almost empty and she didn't even care! Anyway she wasn't looking at my table at all... she was taking good care of other costumers she might known before.  Then suddenly she brought the check! ( we didn't ask for it yet!! ) . At that moment, we decided to add 1 cent as a tip, in order to let the staff to understand what kind of service we had!  Of course she thought that there was an error since there is no way that we ill leave only ONE CENT!! So when we told her it's the reflection of the level of the service e got....she said ok next time don't leave anything..!!! Can you believe how rude she is? she didn't say SORRY!!!
1	Probably the worst buffet I've been too. The french fries were about the only decent thing about this place. 16-18 $ for crappy food, the meat had too much Grissel, the food wasn't hot. Don't even get me started on the dessert table! It was a mess. There were no signs telling what was what and there were just bowls of white creamy stuff that frankly did not look appetizing. The ice cream bowls had some sort of yellow stuff in it...and they were supposed to be CLEAN. The plates also had bits of food stuck to it. As we left we told the waitress it wasn't good and she said there were new owners and she wouldn't even eat there. Overall Crappy foodDirty placeNot returning.
1	This place's cleanliness is not very good, the food is fat, greassy and  barely eatable. We were VERY disappointed. Worst buffet in Montreal.  Do not go there.
