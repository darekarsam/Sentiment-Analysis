4	This is the closest Subway to home, and is conveniently located in an easily accessible strip mall. The store is always very clean and organized, and the people working are friendly and helpful. My only issue with this location is that it is very slow sometimes and gets crowded if there is a rush. Otherwise, it's a solid location
2	We went on at 830PM and they wouldn't prepare flatitzzas for us because they'd have to heat some up in the oven and one of the kids quote, "had already turned the oven off because we're closing at 9PM." On another occasion near the same time, one of the boys told incoming customers that, "we're out of a lot of things," as if to scare them off. If you're open until 9PM, don't make customers feel like they're intruding between 8 and 9.
2	At the moment this one of worst subways that I regularly go to. The service is terrible here. The kids behind the counter are usually rude and dismissive. There is one tall kid that is good and one girl that is also good. Other than that, they rush you through sandwhich making process asking "is that it?" with a snarl. They actually complain about their hours and their management to the customers. They clearly need guidance on good customer service. It's too bad this subway is closest to my home.
