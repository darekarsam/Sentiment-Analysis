4	Wanted an authentic Italian restaurant for supper and I was not disappointed.Had the grilled octopus as an appetizer, cooked very well, not over cooked and te sauce was good. Only one issue, forgot to season the octopus. No salt, no pepper on the octopus.As a main course I had the seafood pasta, super good. Pasta cooked to perfection, al dente!  Two giant shrimps, good sized mussels, and good sauce.Would eat here here again for sure.
5	Best restaurant ever! Food incredible, best wines and service that makes you feel welcome. For special attention ask for Sandro.
