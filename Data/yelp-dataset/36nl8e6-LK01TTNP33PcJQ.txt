3	I'm writing this with giving this new eatery the benefit of the doubt because they just opened, and I hope are ironing out the kinks.   Our waiter was slow and not very energetic.  Only checked on us once the whole meal.  I ordered the grilled cheese with apples and bacon.   It was good, and their tomato soup even better.  My son ordered their Mac and cheese.  He wasn't happy with it, I tasted it too and had no seasoning and was super bland.  The sweet potato fries where the high light of the meal.  Super yummy!  I will come back, but I hope they can step it up.  Another plus is that it's attached to the ice rink in Sub Prairie.  Good entertainment there!!!
5	Very impressed with the food, prices, service and look.  Great family atmosphere with really good stuffed burgers. I recommend the Firehouse Burger with sweet potato fries.  I also had the Dry Rub wings and will say they are hard to beat.  I'm very impressed and will definitely recommend this to my friends!
5	Had a great meal tonight with my husband! Service was excellent as well as the atmosphere and food. I had the pesto avocado griddled cheese with sweet potato fries and a siracha aioli. The griddled cheese was crisp on the outside and melt in your mouth on the inside; the aioli gave the fries just the right amount of kick. My husband had the gooey Louie and thorough enjoyed it. Highly recommend Willie Ty's!
5	Great small pub and grill attached to the Sun Prairie Ice Arena.  Wings are delicious and the beer is very cold. I recommend this place to anyone wanting a beer before a game or after.  Lots of TVs to watch the game and the woodwork is astounding and all made by the owners father.
