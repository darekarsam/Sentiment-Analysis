4	Need a place to stay for a week with out the crazy prices this is your place. Rooms are bigger then most extended stay hotels with a ton of tv channels. Staff is cool but like everywhere you always have that one who just rubs you the wrong way. Would stay here again if needed to, but have to be early they fill up quick.
1	It sucks!!! My room didnt have a trash can! The couch bed was full of springs and cover! But it was roomy and had alot of channels no elevator or handicapped equivalent.
1	The manager, Michael is not a people person. No personality what so ever. The rooms suck.
