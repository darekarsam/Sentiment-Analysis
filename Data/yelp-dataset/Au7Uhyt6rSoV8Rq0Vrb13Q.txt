5	This place is amazing!  I went in not really knowing what to expect, and if anything I was expecting a snotty boutique attitude from the curator of the shop.  I was quite mistaken.  Danny was so nice and friendly... so knowledgeable and helpful.  I bought a pair of vintage frames and they were able to size them, have new prescription lenses put in, and back to me in one day.  The warranty is amazing.  Lifetime maintenance, parts, lenses, and full replacement if needed.I was so impressed with the customer service and knowledge!  I recommend this shop to ANYBODY who is looking for some "retro specs" and wants to be treated right!  TOP NOTCH INDEED!
5	RETROSPECS ROCKS!Absolutely the best level of service, not to mention flawless results.  If you have some eyewear that needs to be refreshed, this is the place to go.  Blake happened to help me with a pair of  my favorite sunglasses that were scratched; they had extremely unique lenses that were a yellow with a slight mirror finish.  I never thought that they would come out Looking BRAND NEW!  Plus, Blake kept me up to date throughout the process and shipped them right to my doorstep.  Thanks to Blake and team for an amazing job!  You guys have absolutely earned my business.
