5	I have been to this location on multiple occasions and the staff has been consistently terrific. They changed out my battery for me when it died on a hot 110 degree day. Also found a part I needed at a different location and offered to have it shipped to my local store later that day. Very helpful.
5	I needed new wiper blades for my car and the guy at the counter, Jerry, was nice enough to install them for me as well.
5	My battery in my Toyota last evening died at an event. I got it jumped & it died again. Then I got it jumped a third time and drove DIRECTLY to O' Reilly's near my home. Ray was outside running a test on someone else's vehicle, so then he came over and tested my battery. It failed. He uninstalled it & took it inside to check it on the bigger machine. It failed. Ray said I needed a new one and showed me all of the options. I was surprised by how reasonable they were priced & they had a $25 rebate, too. I had a new car battery, installed, and out the door in 15 minutes. Ray was really cool, talked to me like a real person, made easy small talk, and installed my new battery quickly. I was really impressed with this place and it's my go to basic auto place now.
5	I ordered brake pads from the online store to be picked up at this location by my partner. Because *I* wasn't going to be picking them up, I had to call the online customer service to arrange it. Easiest call ever. (Except for the questions they ask to verify who you are... I can barely remember yesterday, much less an address I used 15 years ago. But luckily you only have to do that once.)When my partner walked into this location to pick up the pads, she told them why she was there, and they greeted her by name, had everything ready, and she was in and out of there in 5 minutes. It's great when good customer service makes things go smoothly.
