3	This Kmart is huge "old school" huge.  I normally shop at the Kmart on Greenway in Phoenix but due to circumstances we stopped at this one.  This location was clean enough for a Kmart and the employees were nice but they were very low on stock.  It was fairly busy which is nice to see as I remember my mom taking us kids to Kmart back in the day for clothing needs etc.
1	By far one of the worst shopping experiences I've ever had. It's ghetto and the service is incredibly horrible. I'm never going there again. I was there for 45 minutes just to walk out with nothing due to lack of lines being open and the horrible staff. I highly recommend that you never go here unless you want to get frustrated.
5	This store was great. Very clean, well stocked and helpful friendly employees. I would recommend going to this store for nice merchandise at good prices.
1	Half the lights don't work.  Registers freeze up constantly.  Floor and ceiling look like they have been rode hard and hung up wet.  I only shop here when I'm extremely desperate or I'm feeling really really nostalgic.   If you have other options in time, go somewhere else.
4	I received a gift card for Christmas and ended up here. After reading the reviews I told my husband to expect the worst. Upon entering a woman was screaming death threats to a manager that was kicking her out the store. Clearly it looked to me that the woman was on drugs. My husband held my hand, we took a deep breathe and continued to make our way in trying to figure out how to spend $100 there. We walked around a store full of empty shelves.We decided to just use the gift card on line.
