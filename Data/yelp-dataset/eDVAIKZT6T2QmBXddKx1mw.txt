1	Seriously terrible haircut and service.  The lady took about 15 minutes to cut my hair total, with no care or attention to detail.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  Go to SuperCuts or somewhere for $10 haircut of much better quality.
2	I used to go to the Philip Pelusi salon in Bloomfield what seems like ages ago. I got the sexiest best styled cuts of my life there. I then decided to go to the South Side location about 2 months ago. They took me at a moments notice which was great as I usually decide I want a haircut when I wake up in the morning. I told the stylist I was looking for something drastic, very hip, and completely different. I ended up with maybe a few inches trimmed off the back of my almost shoulder length hair.A SLIGHT a-line is not drastic and over the top. I even took many many images of ideas for the cut. While having my hair washed was lovely, the cut really left a lot to be desired.The service itself was good, the people were friendly, but I felt somewhat disappointed in the bland unimaginative cut.
5	I cannot speak of other stylists, but Kristin is very good at cutting my hair!  I have fairly thin and extremely straight hair and she does an exceptional job on my hair!!  She never cuts it too short either, which I appreciate.  I would highly recommend Kristin.  I have recommended others to her and they are very pleased also.
