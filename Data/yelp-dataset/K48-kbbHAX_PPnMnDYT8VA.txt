3	I toured this location for my son. We decided not to attend because we found better care/education and a bit cheaper not much further from this location.It was clean,busy,organized and most of the staff was very friendly.
1	Director is rude. Setup is weird. Teachers don't care.
1	Had a couple problems with this place due to the rude directors but tolerated it because my son loved his teacher. I let them know when we first enrolled that my brother was going to be visiting for a while during the summer so obviously he would watch my sons when I was at work. They said that they were fine with that and we continued the paperwork. I called today to let them know my son will be coming back and the director rudely let me know that they dropped us and there was no more space. What?! No call or anything?! At my sons previous daycare we were gone for a week due to vacation and they called us to check up! (I miss that daycare :-() This place definitely only cares about money and getting in as many students as possible. Beware!
