4	This Java U is located right on the outskirts of Old Montreal close to downtown, probably an ideal location for street traffic from locals to/from work, and to tourists walking to/from the old part of the city. I, of course, was one of the latter. I really enjoyed the vibe walking into the building- the decor was very hip, trendy, but upscale with beautiful chandeliers overhead.  Leather chairs adorned the front for the coffee drinkers/hang-outers, while the back opened up nicely to a bunch of tables for people who stopped in for a meal. The staff were very nice and friendly to the English-speaking tourist, and the coffee and the pastry that I purchased tasted great.
5	Good food and excellent service!!!!The staff and owner are very courteous and very flexible.
3	The breakfast options were all pre-made but perfectly fine for the price (which is very reasonable, considering the proximity to nearby tourist sites). The lone staffer remained amiable even when things got busy, and he turned out a variety of nicely made espresso drinks.You might wind up here when you can't get a table at Le Cartet, but decor-wise it's just as nice, if that's any consolation.
4	Very nice venue in the old port with big windows in the front and numerous tables in the back to accommodate large groups. The quality of the food is standard Java-U : good sandwiches but expect to pay around 10 to 15$ for a combo with your favorite coffee. Most of the staff is super friendly and you can see that the owner cares for good service. For the bad, the WiFi connection is not reliable when you sit in front, which is unfortunate considering its the area with the most sunlight. There is very few power outlets which limit where you can sit and work with your laptop.
