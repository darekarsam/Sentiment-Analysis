4	Big City Bagels has excellent service and bagels to match. Each week I order 3 dozen bagels and the staff is attentive to any special requests. Thanks for the butter!
5	Awesome bagel place. Fresh bagels with super friendly staff and a great bonus program: buy 9 breakfast omelette sandwiches get the 10th free!
4	Ever since visiting New York City and eating at Ess-a-Bagel I've been in search for an amazing everything bagel with lox here in Phoenix.  We stopped to grab a bagel here and the location is perfect, but parking is a bit of a pain in the rear.  It get's a little congested during peak hours.  We placed our order which was made fresh as we waited and we received it within 10 minutes.  The bagel was nicely toasted and it came in two halves instead of pressed together like a sandwich.  I didn't mind, but there could have been a little more cream cheese on it.  the bagel tasted great, but I do miss those NYC bagels.  I would come to Big City Bagels again to get my fix.
