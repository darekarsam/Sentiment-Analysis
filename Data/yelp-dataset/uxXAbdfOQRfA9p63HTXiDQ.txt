2	Not much to say here except upsells and slooooow... always slow here - at least they're consistent though lol.That's about all I got... *shrug*
4	The few times I've been inside this bank there's been  no one else there. So naturally they were pretty quick with service.
1	I am about to be a "former" Premier customer with this bank.  I have had two bad experiences with them, the most recent on 11/18/2014.   A merchant made an error and charged my debit card (used as a credit card) for $4123 instead of 123.00.  They voided the sale, however Wells Fargo will not release the money for up to 15 days!  I have the voided slip... still nothing!  If this is how you want to be treated... bank with them.  If not, find somewhere else to go to.  The fact is, they just have people read off of the computer screens and tell you "they are sorry, but they can't help you".
5	Nothing but a good experience here. Jamieson was extremely helpful in setting up my account and my kids' accounts. I am excited to be a new Wells Fargo customer.
