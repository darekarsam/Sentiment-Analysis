5	Very generous on toppings always very friendly the thin crust is amazing and easy to follow instructions to make a great pizza
3	The staff was super friendly,  and had good service. This was our first time getting pizza from here. Good prices. Unfortunately the pizzas were not that great. Not enough sauce and the sauce that was there was bland. Crust was pretty tasteless. Just average at best, was hoping for better
1	Just bought a medium pizza what a waste of money should have gone to the Thai place next door the medium is so small. 7 eleven pizza is better then this $10.50 for a "medium" the guy working there looks like he hates his job he kept telling us that the pizza was only to take home and bake yourself. We just had a craving for pizza should have gone to little caesars. the pizza  was not good at all I was very disappointed  who would open a restaurant that only does half the work and you have to take it home and finish it. Overall if I could rate with 0 stars I would have DON'T GO HERE spend your hard earned money somewhere else.
5	Just went here for the first time! There pizzas are beautiful! The food is delicious. the staff was wonderful! All around great place!
