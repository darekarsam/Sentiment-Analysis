3	Good old Greggs, the food here can taste like the best lunchtime meal ever if you're in the mood for it, or it can just taste like cardboard. I think everyone has a love/hate relationships with Greggs. This is one of two in Rose Street and when I did the search on Yelp it came up with 1 or 31 Greggs in the area so they really are everywhere.I guess for convenience Greggs is always going to be a winner, their sausage rolls and oval bites are my favourites and I'm rather partial to a chicken bake now and again even though it's innards look like regurgitated cat food. Yum.
3	I've never been a great fan of Gregg's they seem to be taking over the high street where ever you go. I don't think a lot of baking goes on in these stored these days just defrost and serve unless you count the pie section, defrost, bake, serve.When I've come to this store on a Sunday there only seems to be two staff members working, one making the sandwiches and the other serving and taking payment.I find the juices expensive here but what l do like is consistency, no matter where you go you will get the same standard no matter what store you go to.
