5	I purchased a mattress this past week and Josh made it a flawless process. No pressure what so ever and a plethora of knowledge. I didn't immediately buy from R and S and I painstakingly shopped 5 other top ranked and recognized mattress stores to no avail. I am extremely happy. The mattress was received the day after while I wasn't home. My wife was home to receive it and had no issues at all with the delivery. I am so happy that a process typically so irritating was made into such a pleasure. Thank you!!!
1	If given the opportunity, these guys will take advantage of you so watch out. We came to this store with a $40 credit and wanted to buy a mattress protector. The salesman tells us that the mattress covers cost $90 and that we then owe $50. When we checked online the same mattress covers cost $35 from the manufacturer's website, and when we called another R&S mattress store, we were told that mattress covers cost $40--not $90 as we were told in this store.  It looks like they have nice mattresses, but they do not value their customers or honesty.
5	I went to R&S just to see what they had, didn't expect to buy anything.I talked to Marcel Ramos and he walked me through the 'everywhere name brand' mattresses and I am impressed with his knowledge and honesty, with no sales pressure.A delivery of new mattresses just arrived and he had me try Brooklyn gel memory foam and I liked it.He was in a good mood and he made me a great deal for the mattress, wood foundation, 2 latex pillow, best bed protector and delivery today by 5pm, WOW!I couldn't pass up this deal, I paid less than the other stores and bed felt comfortable and in budget.Just great people and great deals with R&S!!!
5	We went to R&S mattress on the day before Thanksgiving to look around and walked out 30 min later with a new mattress.  Marcel was extremely helpful. He explained the various mattress choices.  They delivered the mattress that same day.  I would highly recommend them.
