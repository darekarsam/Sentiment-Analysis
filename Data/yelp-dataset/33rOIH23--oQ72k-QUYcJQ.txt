5	It's hard to find a DJ that is talented, punctual and quick to reply to calls and emails. I found that in DJ Hart Break. I've used DJ Hart Break a couple of times now for events and every time, he's been on time, responsive and friendly. Oh and he spins some great music too. That's probably pretty important when looking for a DJ! DJ Hart Break spins pretty much anything you ask him to, but he does a great job spinning for a lively setting, such as a large scale party or a bar scene. He does a good job at keeping the music at a level where the party goers can still hear themselves speak but while music plays in the background. Like I said, DJ Hart Break does a great job of communicating and that's important to me when planning an event. It's also important for a DJ to show up to the event when the event organizer asks him to show up (and not five minutes before the event begins) and so DJ Hart Break gets five points in my Yelp book for this too because no only is he on time, he's actually been early. So if you need a DJ for an event, I definitely suggest DJ Hart Break!
5	DJ Hartbreaks rocks!  Professional and responsive to the events needs as well as having a fine tuned ear for up to the minute tunes that you haven't always heard before.
5	I was given DJ HartBreaks name from a friend a called him with a random request. Can you spin tracks for us at an outdoor yoga event called Yoga Rocks the Park? Oh, and no pressure, but I have you paired up to DJ with a nationally recognized yoga teacher that is known for his hip-hop playlist.DJ HartBreaks was easy to work with and kept the class moving and people feeling good! It was a new experience for him and he handled it like a true professional! I hope to work with him again--It is not easy to find a DJ that can keep up with us yogis!Thanks for everything!!Yoga Rocks the Park-Phoenix
