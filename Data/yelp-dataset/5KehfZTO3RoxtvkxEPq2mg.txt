4	I am really surprised this place has not had a review yet since it is located in the same building as the Slidin Thru HQ. But, I checked out this place waiting for the Food Truck Triangle challenge to start and I grabbed a beer. Inside is just a normal Vegas dive bar with Video poker and such surrounding the bar. The crazy thing is that the bar had 2 really hot bartenders working wearing only corsets and bras. I was not expecting that in a random dive bar at all. Also they had a pretty large selection of bottled beer and it was all $2?! Crazy! The hot bartender who was really nice with the red bra said it was happy hour and told me the times but I was too busy trying to look at ceiling so, I would not stare at her chest. So I wish I could remember when this magical cheap beer time happened again or maybe there extremely simple website could get updated soon.Anyways all and all great cheap beer to go with the great bites next door. Also, I am still wondering if there is some type of underground brothel going on here because the girls here did not belong but, oh well it is still good.

3	First visit to this hidden gem near the airport.  I believe the name is now Poker Paradise Pub due to new ownership.Overall decent place. Has a super nice shuffleboard!   It is located in a business park next to the airport and does have some outdoor picnic table-style seating.  Tonya was our bartender and she immediately introduced herself and made us feel welcome.  We asked her to pour a drink of her choosing for us and she made a nice "adios amigos" blue drink that was tasty.Food is served from the business next door and it was very good.  We had the potato skins; they were huge and well priced at $4.95.Crowd was mix of younger and older folks, all very low key and having a good time.  It is a small place and no one was overly loud.Looking forward to a return visit.Pros:  Cheap happy hour from 3p-7p and 12a-8a - $2.00 beer and $2.50 well drinks             Friendly service (Tonya on Friday swing shift)             Purse hooks under the bar             Food service             Gaming             Shuffleboard             Plenty of TVs             Jukebox/music was at a nice but not too loud volumeCons:  Limited non-gaming seating
