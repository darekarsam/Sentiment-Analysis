5	Working with Eric and his crew was such a pleasure.  We love, love, love our yard now. Eric came up with a great design and the follow thru was perfect.  The one small problem of  one of the lights not working was addressed right away.  Couldn't be more pleased and would highly recommend this company.
5	Erik is amazing! He is very helpful, friendly and worked on our project like he was working on his own - precise, thoughtful, creative. His diligent team were so friendly and took great care with everything they did. Erik truly went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. We highly, highly recommend him! Thanks to Erik we now have beautiful grass and curbing.
