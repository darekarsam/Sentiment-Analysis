3	I don't drink coffee.  Ever.  I do like donuts, however I prefer Krispy Kreme.  But this Dunkin Donuts location happens to be attached to Baskin Robbins - as do most of the DD locations in the Charlotte area, for that matter, and I'll eat the heck out of some ice cream.It's hard to place when Baskin Robbins did away with their 31 flavors tagline, but I don't think that this location has 31 flavors - at least of ice cream (you could add toppings to get there, I'm sure).  They do have some interesting flavors, and they are good enough.  The place is clean, and the service is usually good.Even on an otherwise nondescript evening the place can get crowded too.  While I probably wouldn't choose them over the creamery across the street for their taste, they do have air conditioning, which can be nice during the recent string of nasty humid days...
1	Horrible I went in there and I didn't like the ice cream and they wouldn't even let me trade out. Then they take about 10 minutes to come to customer service. Then they never ever have the kind of donut you want! (I don't recommend this place!!)
1	I stopped by on Sunday afternoon and purchased a medium coffee. The coffee was fine. However, this Dunkin Donut was not very clean. The floor was not cleaned behind the counter and in the lobby area. No one seemed to care about making sure this establishment was clean. In fact, the official sanitation rating was "90" and that was probably on a good day. In my opinion, the owners need to do some additional employee training to establish higher standards for quality. If the floors are not clean, I wonder about the prep work for making donuts.
