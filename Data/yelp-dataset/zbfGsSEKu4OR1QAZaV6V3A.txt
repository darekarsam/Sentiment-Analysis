5	I got my first tattoo here a while back when I was a U of I student.  Nick, the owner, was very friendly and considerate of my feelings, as I was a bit scared at first to go under the needle.  He worked freehand from a photo that I brought in, and while he insisted on making some artistic changes to my design, they turned out to be for the better.  I have more tattoos now, but my first is still my favorite.  The color has held up nicely over almost 10 years.  I'm hoping to travel back down to Champaign for a new tattoo from Mark of Cain!
5	Great pricing and place for piercing, in the case of my tragus and 2nd lobe piercings. I recommend this place if you want a sanitary, quick piercer who is no-nonsense and gets the job done immediately. The second place I've tried on campus, this location was way faster and hygienic than the other one. Also, better priced at app. $20 for a lobe and $30 for a cartilage. Basically efficient, well-priced, and quick piercings for students.
