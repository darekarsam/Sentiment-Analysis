2	We took our Chihuahua for Anal gland Abscess. Veterinarian suggested for a surgery worth $400. Our visit with a shot cost us $55. Not sure what the shot is for, if the only option is surgery.Next I come home to find online that surgery is the most barbaric thing to do with the dogs and is not suggested. I'm going to take that $55 loss and go see some other doctor.Not to mention, this place is in ghetto, looks and smells like it. Veterinarian couldn't speak good English. I didn't feel like I could get answers from him, so no point in discussing further. I'm not coming back and will stay miles away from this area!
