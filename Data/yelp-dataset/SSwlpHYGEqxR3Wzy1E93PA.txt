2	Food is OK.  Female server is great, tries hard.  The male server is disinterested.
4	The boy and I eat here around once or twice a month. I'm not a huge Mexican fan, but this is by far the best Mexican restaurant downtown. It's not Mexico, but it's tasty nevertheless I would recommend it if you are downtown and hankering for some Mexican!
1	I ate here once about 6 years ago and got food poisoning. The thought of Mexican food still turns my stomach. Thanks, Cuzamil.
