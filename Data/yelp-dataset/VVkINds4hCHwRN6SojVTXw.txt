2	This place is cheap for sure especially if you have no insurance. However for about every $100 you save over going to the doctor's you will spend about 1 hour here. For my initial exam it took over 3 hours!!! And this was WITH an appointment. The second and third time just picking up birth control pills (which I called ahead and ordered) it still took over an hour just to get them. Now that I've transfered to a different location it's been over a week to get my files transferred. Now, I don't know whose fault this is but still... The only pro is the price. If you have time to kill you can get $25 birth control pills here.
2	The prices are great but the wait is CRAZY just for picking up birth control that I called in on Monday it has taken me more than an hour. I finally got called but they can't find my pills I ordered four days ago.. Now I'm still waiting and I'll be surprised if they actually do anything for me. I should have known.. The first time I came here for my initial visit it took two hours with an appointment.. That's only 30 minutes of actually being in the back getting checked up and an hour and a half of wIt time! :( the only person that could finally help me was Adrianna! Thank you!
2	Well the front desk lady was nice at first. Then when I decided to leave (because the wait is ridiculous) she laughed and made a smart remark. I was still polite as she handed me back my ID. I noticed the prices have changed. It's more expensive and id be better off going somewhere else.
