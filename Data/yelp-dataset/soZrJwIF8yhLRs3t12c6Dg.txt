4	It's funny, just when I was thinking "this area needs one more bar" Huis Clos pops up. Sitting on the sunny side of St Denis, corner Villeray, and opened by the same crew that brought you Monsieur Smith out in HOMA, Huis Clos is most definitely welcome. It's a little on the edge of fancy for my taste, but with a nice selection of cocktails around the $10 range I am not mad at them. The Mojito and Ceasar were classic and strong, and the $22 charcuterie sharing plate was actually big and hearty and plenty for two people, with neat tastes like the pickled egg and vegetables, and the beet mustard. The big backlit lettered sign with drink specials looks great and helps prevent the feeling of squinting at a chalkboard in a dim bar so popular around town. There's a sizeable booth in the back nearby windows into the kitchen, but the prime seat for me is right in the front in the setting sun, I'll be back earlier next time to try and slip into it. Service was slow but super friendly, I think they'll ramp right up into excellent.
3	Maybe a 3.5 ?It was nothing fancy, not a large choice of beers, a share plate of cheese with two good ones and a tasteless one, a really nice service.I guess it's worth seeing another time, it was on a Friday night and it was not too noisy, so it's kind of a good thing to just hang out and have a chat.
4	Just what the neighborhood needed! A Habs game, three bloody caesars and a charcuterie plate later... I'm hooked! So happy this place is walking distance.
