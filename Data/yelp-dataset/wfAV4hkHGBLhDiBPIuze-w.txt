5	Grayson SkatePark is the real deal where you can witness some pretty amazing shredding.  I'm not a skater but it's still fun to hear the kids shouting about 'dropping their first bowl' and watching the veterans shake their heads in disgust.  It's a super friendly environment and when I stopped by there was even a radio station dj-ing some good vibes for the skaters to grind to.  Both boards and roller blades at this park.  There's some amazing craft work that goes into making a seamless giant slab of concrete and steel that the kids won't kill themselves on no matter how hard they try.  Sure they might break some bones and teeth, but some might say "if you haven't broken anything your entire life, you haven't lived."  I broke a toe once.  It hurt like hell!!
4	Anyone who sees me can tell that I am not a skater, nor have I ever been one.  But I am a pretty good spectator.While I really have no idea what happens on a regular basis at the skate park - not being particularly hip either - we dropped into see the Battle Slam Jam (number six, if anyone is keeping track).The paths around the park were filled with booths, not unlike the other festivals around town, except the artwork is perhaps a different style.  During the day there were several age groups performing in the park itself, X Games style.  Perhaps a bit more organized than a typical day at the park.Even us old folk felt generally welcomed.
1	Skaters beware,  this is a communist park ran by racist people who don't like skaters.  This place had ridiculous rules that constantly change.  Be very careful, if someone there doesn't like you ,  they will kick you out.   Don't waste your time or money here...   sucks sucks sucks sucks.  Including the staff!
