3	Good shoe selection within the brand, including the normal and wide sizes - but most importantly, they have larger sizes in stock for those of us who are tall.  There's a few good sales recently and I've picked up one of the top of the line shoes at a hefty discount.  Socks, insoles and other attire are decent here, but it's primarly the shoes that draw people in here.
5	Love this store.  There is always something in stock in my size in whatever color or style I am looking for.  They even had my husbands 14 EEEEEE (yes, 6 E's) in stock.  Outfitted the whole family in less than 15 minutes and we were outta there.  HAPPY feet all around.
5	Awesome store, NB Scottsdale, you are the bomb!
5	What a great staff, excellent service and a place that remembers that "Customers" are the way the bills get paid. Although I didn't have time to get into the store before my coupon expired, I called ahead and they not only had my shoes waiting for me (because they know my size and preference), but honored the coupon which had been expired for almost a week. WOW me! Thanks so much.
1	Do not go here. They actually put my inserts in the wrong shoes which were way too big and caused a fall and a torn calf muscle. They will not even repair my phone which broke when I fell and I have doctor bills due to these injuries that I did that not ask a cent for.  They did replace the shoes which were obviously too big.  Terrible customer service.
5	Great store and location.. New Balance shoes are just about the best around and the service I got from these guys was phenomenal!!! If I could give them 20 stars I would.
5	Friendly gentleman that greeted me when I came in....when he noticed that i was talking longer than, what I'm sure is, normal to pick out a pair of laces, he offered his help
