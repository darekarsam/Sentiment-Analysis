1	We went in and saw a lamp we liked. But the price was ridiculous. They told us it was a 600 to 700 dollar lamp and therefore a steal at 275. Well, I call shenanigans. The lamp was new and still had a tag on it (it was also seriously damaged in one part) on amazon this same lamp brand new and undamaged, delivered free was 266.48. We offered 200 on it and were told that they'd think about it and call us back. No one called us back.According to the blog someone bought the lamp. So they got totally hosed. They could have saved 9 dollars AND gotten an undamaged lamp brand new in the box.I would bet that the owners of Redesignation knew they were overcharging but relied on the stupidity of customers. Honestly, I don't blame them in a way. If customers are too stupid to even google a product before buying it used (especially if they have a smart phone) then I guess they deserve to be taken advantage of. I just don't think its good for long term business. Afterall, they have lost us as customers and we'll tell others that they have terrible prices.

I really loved the shop--it has a great variety of styles, and many of the things are affordable for people on modest budgets. It is definitely WAY cheaper than any new furniture store, and (unlike  Goodwil or Salvo) everything there is clean and in really good condition. Inventory wise, it had everything from funky, vintagey stuff to traditional stuff that you'd find at your parents' house. I ended up buying some funky drapes, a fun throw pillow, and a few kitchen things. The selection there changes a lot, so I plan to go back again soon. The owner was super nice and helpfu tool--not pushy at all, and she knew when to let me browse freely. We need more unique stores like this in Pittsburgh!
