5	One of the best gyms I've ever been to! Kane kicks your butt in the gym and really makes you sweat the second you walk in the door. This place doesn't waste any time while you're there and the prices are affordable. I'll even come in on my lunch break at times and get a work out in. Super convenient!This gym is very personable and truly cares about each client. If you're wanting to get in shape and have a trainer who holds you accountable for your health, this is the place to be.
5	This place is absolutely great! I could spend all day working out here! Kane is the boss when it comes to personal training, and you'll notice results within the first week! Not only am I hooked, but I got my friends hooked! I would definitely recommend coming! So much fun and super affordable!
