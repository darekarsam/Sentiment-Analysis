Jen & Caleb, the owners, have a real passion for furniture and are a real pleasure to deal with. If you're looking for something particular, they will try to keep an eye out for pieces for you. They also offer custom (re)upholstery and delivery of your furniture.I absolutely love this store and I've bought many great items from OMT over the last few years. Because of their fabulous customer service (and their amazing, ever-changing inventory), they have a earned a customer for life. They aren't open every day, but will be glad to schedule an appointment with you for a viewing if there's something you're interested in. You can check out what they have on Facebook or on Instagram (@onemanstrashlasvegas).
