5	As an energy healer and massage therapist, I had wanted to visit this place for awhile. I finally did, and it is easily the best store in Vegas for crystals, gemstones,minerals, and just plain interesting stuff. The store is much bigger than it looks from the outside--I was happily surprised with the entire back area offering so much more than I had imagined! The prices are reasonable as well. If you are a local, this is a place you must visit, and if you are a tourist, I encourage you to check it out as well.
5	Must see stop if you are into Rocks, Stones, Crystals and Minerals.  The number and size of their crystals are amazing.  You probably will not even see examples like these in a museum. This place must be a major supplier to most of the Western US and even possible Museums around the world.    Last time I was there, one of the store's many friendly and quirky employees showed me the back of the store which had at least 20 1000 lb Shiva Linghams.  At that time, the also has probably the worlds biggest Crystal ball in an enormous truck.  The diameter of this HUGE crystal ball was at least 20 ft.   I think it was going to some museum.  Selection, quality and prices can not be beat. Even on Ebay. CHECK out the store when in town. Promise you it will be worth the visit. even if you do not buy anything, go there and absorb the amazing vibes from the crystals from around the world.
3	I am a rock nerd. So, obviously, I was psyched to find this store and to find out...it's huge.  They seriously cram a lot of stuff in this store that it's slightly overwhelming.  If you want fossils, they have them.  If you're looking for geode towers, they have it.  If you're looking for crystals, your energy healing awaits.  I ended up purchasing a chysoprase display that was really interesting and unique.  However, in the interim, I had to deal with hovering sales associates and the owner fighting with another employee over some non-issue. Super awkward shopping atmosphere.  I also was unable to find any decent moldavite jewelry or meteorites (something every true rock nerd store should have).Overall, I'll likely be back (who knows, maybe I'll be in a jam and need some rocks). Recommended to those that are bored and in need of nifty decorating accessories.
5	While visiting Vegas my sister and I were told about this store. My sister owns a metaphysical store in Chicago, so we thought we would check it out. Both of us are avid crystal collectors and this place will blow you away. The store is huge, room after room, hidden rooms for wholesale buyers that we were taken into. This store has the best collection I have ever seen, mainly due to the mass and size of some pieces. Some cathedrals were 10 feet tall, beautiful especially all of the amethyst. Two very nice gentleman were showing us around and we were taken outside to see the largest sphere in the country. Tumbled stones, Buddha's, quan yin, salt lamps, Tibetan singing bowls, Cd's, Mala's oh my I was in over load. Then my sister spotted this twenty foot table with singing bowls on them, different colors, sizes, they were gorgeous crystal bowls. A very nice guy came over to work them all for us. I could not believe the sound and vibration coming off of them. Crystal singing bowls affect your energy centers (chakras) for healing, balancing, and meditation. The guy who was helping us had a haircut like Elvis Presley, ha ha he was soft spoken, cool, and had a great peaceful aura about him. He worked the bowls for me, healing me balancing and it was awesome, loved it. We hung around looking at everything enjoying every beautiful piece. My sister will be placing an order for her store, their prices are reasonable and excellent quality. These pieces are museum quality, unbelievable. What a fabulous store that I will visit again or order on line, they do ship. yay! Service is fabulous, so friendly and helpful.
5	The owner helped me personally (after closing hours)...and took time to explain the origin of the iron meteriote i had purchased. He was a very kind man. With lovely stories of other people who had purchased varies meteorites over the years from him.... Its a HUGE store, with everything you could possible be looking for :0) ....Oh, i also purchased some beautiful Moldivite as well, simply gorgeous. Needless to say I WILL be purchasing again from this "Gem of a store".
5	I'm a nerd for rocks and this place is like my second home. Best selection. Best staff. Period dot the end. I swear most rock places are either really fancy and strange (who dusts that shit?!) or super dirty and disorganized. This place is gigantic and clean but not like something at the Fashion Show mall, and homey. Miguel is my favorite, The man that looks like Swayze too. I'd go there just to visit them but it's always expensive when I go into that store.  The owner is really passionate about what he brings into his store and the prices are very fair. Everybody knows what they're talking about, and if they don't, they don't make shit up either. I swear in fifty years all I'll probably remember about living in Las Vegas will be the rock shop.
5	Had the most Mind blowing Experinece here!This place rocks!  Seriously they have hundreds of gems, fossils, rocks etc etc. I wish they were closer to get to.So my friend Dawn R. who flew in from Portland for the Yelp Spring Break had been looking for 6 gems for a Feng Shui thing in the living room.  Everything on the internet was just a online store and not a business that you could walk into.  When it comes to gems and minerals you want to hold and see.  Think about a diamond for example.  Wouldn't you rather see it and touch in person before buying!   Well the Yelp Ap came to the rescue again.  This place is on the outskirts of downtown and easy to get to.  I wasn't sure want to expect since there was less than 10 reviews but WHOA when we walked in it was like DAYUM.  They have A LOT of stuff.  They have the place organized by the minerals, gems and fossils in the front.  When you go to the back you can find even more minerals, gems in all type of sizes and shapes and even a sections of beads.  Another smaller room where they have Buddhist statues.  I was totally impressed with the amount of items this place carries.I personally was not looking for anything in particular.  I was looking at some pendulum and I tried out a few.  There was one answering me even when I was not holding it so I getting it.   I also purchased a Moldavite http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavite.  Something I had never heard of until that day.  I was curious to know more about it and Miguel was the one who took the time to explain what it was and how people use it.  Being that I had by Reiki 1 & 2 done and he was a Reiki Master and had also done theta healing I knew exactly what he was talking about in terms of energy work.  I could totally feel the warmth from this one gem from holding it in my hand.  I felt like what one may feel when having a hot flash.  It was pretty odd how this little gem was giving off that much energy.  There are only 3-4 mines and it is estimated that it will all be gone in the less than 10 years so I thought I should get one.   So I picked a pendant http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jMrpr92nMEhe4cC4FF00VQ?userid=3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg#hddvoHue4g2iC-Tv6KuvRA and a chain I like and put it on.  The pendant sat right between my heart and throat chakra and I could immediately feel the warmth in my chest area.   Now this is when things got interesting.  As we were checking out, Miguel had left to the back room to grab a bag for my pendulum.  When he returned he told me to put out both hand and close my eye.  Hmmm that is a strange request but I obliged.  He then put a good size spirit quartz in both hands and told me to hold on an feel.  I seriously never ever ever felt so much energy and vibration coming from gem before.  It was so intense my hands were shaking.  It shot up through my arms and straight to my chest and was pounding right were the Moldavite pendulum lay.  I was totally speechless and all that came out of my mouth was Oh Shit, Oh my goodness, Oh Damn Oh my god etc etc.   A minute or so into it Miguel proceeds to share with me a message from my spirit guide to not be so hard on myself and to take things slowly and to take my time.  With the massive energy and vibration going through me and what I was hearing I teared up big time.  This was so unexpected and a great surprise.  It was one of the most amazing experience I had in a store!!!  Now this is not to be expected with every person that comes in but I was totally opened to it and was ready for it and so I welcomed it.  Freaking amazing.   I was feeling that energy pretty much all day, it was freaking great!!!! Anywho, if your' looking to buy a few pieces for feng shuei or maybe even by a Moldavite and you happen to be visiting sin city you have got to stop by this place.  It's a gem of a place!Locale ~ Downtown Offerings ~ Gems, Minerals, Jewelry, StatuesExtras ~ Ask for Miguel,  He is very knowledgeable and helpful!
5	This place is amazing, I try to stop by everytime im in town and it is worth the trip. They have new items every time I stop by. The pieces in the back are amazing! They have something for every budget, I do hope I can get one of the bigger ones someday!P.S. ask someone to see the worlds largest crystal sphere!
5	I always have a good time here. They have so many things,  it blew my mind the first time. Mike is the best, he showed us the best stuff and I was surprised to see everything was affordable. He helped me change my life, and he is so knowledgeable. I come back every couple weeks and they always have something new. I will definitely keep coming back.
5	This is an amazing place the staff are talented. Very knowledgeable about everything in the store. I went to "look" and I ended up spending $250- but I'm very happy with my purchases and I was even able to learn about Moldavite. Is now become my obsession.
4	easily spent over $100 while we visited this store, and we just wanted to 'run' in and check it out. but they have a great selection.  I would just suggest that when selling the stones you know what they are for and how they can help you out. but everyone is friendly and so attentive.
4	Great Store.  The amount and the variety of stock is awesome.  Easily one of the best crystal/rock shops I have seen in my travels.
3	When I need my crystal/rock/mineral fix, of course, I come here!!  It's ginormous, Mike is always there, VERY knowledgeable and really knows his stuff.I would like to see more organization & labeled merchandise to make it easier for the crystal-enthusiast to do their shopping - even descriptions of what the crystals mean would be amazing so we don't have to keep pestering Mike.The store is huge with a huge selection!!
5	Mama pajama!!!Energy central!  This. Place. Is. Amazing!  We spent approximately 3 hours in this store and could've spent longer, it's like Disneyland for healers.The amount of crystals, stones, and minerals is abundant here.  I mean PLETHORA! The variety is simply marvelous.  The staff is FANTASTIC and always willing to help answer questions.Tumbled stones, raw stones, jewelry whatever form you want your rocks in, they've got it!  Their prices are so reasonable too!  Just be prepared to come with the amount of money you're willing to spend...you could easily walk out of there spending more than you intended.  A large amount of their stones are charged by weight, so at the end when you leave it will be weighed.  This shouldn't be a deterrent because so many sizes are offered and you have choices.  This shouldn't be intimidating at all.Miguel, is so knowledgable and is a FANTASTIC healer.  He did an impromptu healing on my friend and you could feel the heat radiating off of him.  Truly authentic and a very helpful individual.I have officially put this store on my 'What I need to do in Vegas every time I go' list.  I *highly* recommend this place if you are a healer, you will not regret this experience!
2	Hey I went into this place after reading all the raving reviews.... gotta say was disappointed with the people in it. I walked in and their doors have a chime to let them know ... someone came up to see and did not even say hello nothing. Then 3 to 4 minutes later another patron walks in young blond etc and I suddenly hear him greet her and ask if she would like any help. He also asked another lady who was in the same room if she needed help..These 2 men walked around and not once was i asked for assistance. I am in the healing industry and was very keen to purchase some items....The store was not as impressive as it was made out. And if you are in the business of selling these items keep an open heart and a welcoming presence.
4	Hippie zealots, earth energy mongers, mineral collectors or (like myself) fossil freaks will be in heaven here.  You know you have passed by this place before and seen the tall giant geodes with amethysts before.  If you ever stop inside you just may find a little geologist in you.  The decorative stones and gems can be found in all shapes and sizes.  Perfect for bead work or hemp jewelry makers.  I love the fossil shapes and furnishings.  Things such as a black granite sink carved out of fossil rich stone.  paper weights and desk objects abound.  There are worldly crafts and also the largest crystal sphere in the world is here too.  You just have to ask and the staff will take you to it in the back.  I mean we're talking Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom large!  Kids will have a blast and adults alike.
2	Coming up to this location is a little weird. The parking lot is very close to the street and a little tight. Walking up to the door, you do see the large amethyst out front. The surrounding glass/container needs to be cleaned out. It is filled with trash, and I think I even saw a bracelet in there. The gemstone is so gorgeous, and it doesn't give a very good impression.... Kind of makes me feel like they don't care enough to clean up.Walking in, we were greeted. There were two employees. One seemed more knowledgeable than the other. I asked the shorter gentleman if he had anything for fertility, and he told me no. I whipped out my phone and looked up stones for fertility, and began asking the other gentleman if they had any bracelets/necklaces made out of these stones. He pointed me in the direction of a large amount of bracelets that were $6 each. There were no labels above any of these bracelets. They just hang there.For a newbie, if I'm not 100% sure what I'm looking at, the labeling would greatly be appreciated.Also, the general organization of this store.... Throws me off. There's really no..."flow'. You will go on a HUNT around and around looking. Maybe going alphabetically throughout the store is possible.? But like I said... There's labels..But they aren't very descriptive. The employees do tend to "hover" and follow you around... I don't really mind, But, it would have been helpful if they once asked if I was finding everything okay.... Or if they could help.... They didn't initiate conversation with me... I always had to ask. I'm not sure if the store has any A/C .... Because I felt myself getting very hot. They did have one fan going in the beading/make your own jewelry room.  But that's it. There are some things that are priced reasonable, and there are some things that are VERY expensive. Therefore, keep an eye on your children! Some of those stones can be a mortgage payment. Overall. I like it. The employees were nice enough.... And we did end up making a few purchases. If you spend over $100, don't forget to use your YELP check in offer.11/16/14Two of the bracelets I bought is already falling apart. A week old. Not cool.**Owner:1/1/2015**"I believe you must have parked on the sahara parking lot. We also have 15 other parking spaces in our other parking lot, some of which our tractor trailer can fit in when we have a delivery... I am really confused by this review. In 26 years of being in business I have never heard comments like these. We have employees nearby to help if it is requested. There is no other place on the West coast of America like our store, let alone in all of America. I don't understand how yelp can allow such slander, if these are true comments, please contact us and I am sure we can show you how untrue all of these things are. Thank you."**1/5/2015- Response to owner.**Good to know that you have more than one parking lot, I'll keep that in mind.I'm not sure how my review is confusing to you....If your employees are going to follow me around the store, maybe they should check in on me, Not just lean up against a wall and stare. I don't understand how my review is "slander". It's an honest experience...so I'm not sure how they can be untrue. I don't recall seeing you that day, so, please enlighten me on how you can show me how "untrue" my review is. I have a check in, I have pictures of your products, and your store.......If the "slander" is myself reviewing the quality of the bracelets you sell, I'll post pictures of how they are falling apart. I bought three on my visit to your store, and now only ONE is wearable.
