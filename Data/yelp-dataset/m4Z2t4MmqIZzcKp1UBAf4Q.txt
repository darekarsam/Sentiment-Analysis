3	I remember back in the day when Hot Topic and Spencers seemed like different stores. Today, I can't really tell a difference as they kind of sell the same weird kind of crap. I went with a friend and they didn't have what they were looking for. At least the staff was knowledgeable of their store and let us know so we didn't have to walk around like 12yr old zombies trying to find something that wasn't there.
3	My kids love this place.  Cool shirts and gear based upon cable shows and rock groups.  Obviously for a youthful demographic.  Sales people certainly represent that.  Prices seem reasonable for licensed items.  Quality seems good too.
4	Pop culture heaven in useful items like clothes, wallets, phone cases, jewelry, music, fragrances and more for both males & females. Always love the variety. Pricey, but they usually run sales so you rarely have to pay full prices.
5	I used to go here all the time when I lived in Glendale to buy cool stuff.  But the best thing about the store was the rocker chic assistant manager who used to work there.  She was piping hot crazy gorgeous.  We were good friends.  I don't know what ever became of her, but anyone who shopped there and knew her knows what I'm talking about.  She was incredibly breathtaking to look at, yet so friendly, approachable, and down to earth.  She usually had her long black hair in French braid pigtails, and had the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen in my life.  Plus she had the most amazing gigantic rack in all of the Phoenix area.  They were massive, enormous, and 100% firm and natural.  Wow, I miss her, and the store too.
