5	I found Excel Chiro Care from driving pass by every night after work. My mom had a bad ankle pain from her accident 2 years ago.We did not want to go back to Dr. that previously treated her, that's why we tried Excel Chiro Care.The staff was friendly, fast and helpful. Waiting area are clean and inviting. We get there around 4PM, seen Dr.Bobby Forsyth, He did spent a good amount of time with my mother & seem to me that he enjoys working with people.I highly reccommend him to all my friends or anyone looking for an excellent chiropractor who knows his profession and provides excellent services.
5	I went to Excel Chiro after a friend recommended the place.  I don't live in LV so I was skeptical but my experience was great.  I would recommend it to anyone.
5	Dr James Lo is mad cool. He tells you straight up about your problems and tells you how to fix it or make it better. His fast and there is almost no wait after the first time you go.Also there are 2 massage chairs so you can use while your waiting. Sweet.
5	I like this place .The staff was friendly atmosphere was relaxing (my sister fell asleep while I was being treated)  lol.The Dr. Asked me what my problems were and he went straight to work.I felt better ,he relieved all the tension on my upper back.The massage chair and acupuncture were a help also.I recommend this place.
5	Dr James Lo is excellent.He cares about everyone he treats.  Excel Chiro Care would be the place to go if you want to be well!  From back/muscle/sprained ankle/headache/allegeries - this office should definitely be on your place to go!
