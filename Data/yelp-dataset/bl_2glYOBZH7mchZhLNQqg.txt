5	Beautiful cacti and beflowered lawn landscapes, two gold clubs, and a safe peaceful oasis from Phoenix. If you're looking for a new place to reside, this is one of the most easy on your mind and nerves.  Ride your bikes down the wide bike lanes up and down, through the parks, and the multitude of running paths that run up and down all of the neighborhoods.  It feels like High School Musical in your head.
5	The community of Vistancia is a beautiful and very well planned and managed development.  The amenities are first rate.  The community center, aquatic center are fantastic. The public Trilogy Golf Course at Vistancia was rated five stars by Golf Digest... A very exclusive honor for a public course.  It is a place that just feels good to be alive in.  Can't wait to live there.
2	I love the home we built here in Vistancia but I would advise others to think before you upgrade to a view fence in your back yard.  If your neighbors don't like you having patio lights the HOA will force you to take them down by calling them "Holiday Lights".  Any time you write anything to your HOA that you pay dues to about something you disagree with that goes against what they "feel" they will say you're the only one with this view/complaint and will dismiss it.  Like I said, I do love our home but not a fan of this HOA.  I never imagine someone would dictate what you do in your own backyard.  I can see if we were doing something out of the normal but patio lights, really?!  Our lights have been up for a year.  The HOA isn't fair with following their rules.  Some things they follow and others they over look.  The community areas are okay but their community pool could use an update, specially the pool by the HOA.  My children loved the idea of having slides at the pool, but we found out later it can be painful as it scrapes as you when you slide down.  Sad, we cannot enjoy the lot we paid the upgrade for when building our dream home!
