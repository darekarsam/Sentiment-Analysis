3	This place is also known as Pho Net-  which satisfied two cravings.  My friend wanted vegetarian sushi and I wanted some Goi Cuon and Bahn Mi.  From my tourist experience in Montreal, where we were staying, it is very difficult to find a vegetable to eat.  Basically, all that we were finding were French fries in various forms, mostly meat covered.  Potato being the only vegetable found near St Denis.  Therefore, I found myself searching out Vietnamese restaurants to gorge out on fresh vegetables.My friend had Sundried Tomato and Cream Cheese rolls and I had vegetarian Bahn Mi and Goi Cuon, and a iced Vietnamese Coffee.  Both were decent, but not that memorable.

3	Late night eats, and family service?  Limited English, but between my rusty French, and Spanish we got along just fine.  Everything was delicious, fast, and the service was fantastic. The prices are EXTREMELY reasonable.  Considering this place was empty and the place next door was packed it was a gamble, but we lived to enjoy our meal, and I can rightfully say, it's A-OK with me.
