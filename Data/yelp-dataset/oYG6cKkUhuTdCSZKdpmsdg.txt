5	Went in to get a box that I was not able to sign for for the 3 times it came to my house. It's a large facility but they have signs for customer parking, so was easy to find where to go. Went in at around 5ish and he said that they might have already shipped it back to the shipper, it was the last day that I could pick up box. He went to the back and found it! Overall good experience, better than I have EVER had with FedEx!
1	Ship your stuff any other way you can, you will be frustrated with the service from the drivers and the non existent customer service. what a joke
1	I have had nothing but frustration for 3 days trying to re-direct my upcoming delivery.  Yesterday I had planned to be out in the afternoon, and sure enough, that's when the delivery came.  Door tag said it would be delivered between 2PM and 5PM the next day.  I adjusted my day's plans accordingly, and have been waiting not-so-patiently since Noon today.  It is now 5:45 and no UPS van in sight.  So much for my evening dinner engagement.  Calls to Customer Service cannot tell me any more than "the package is on the truck and is in route" but I was also advised that  drivers deliver up to 8PM.  Humph.
