5	I've been doing business with these guys for years!  They have a great shop full of power equipment, and it's the good stuff!  No cheapy Home Depot power tools here.  The best part is that their sales and service can't be beat and they have great prices!  Looking to purchase some equipment?  Come talk to these guys!-TREEWISE, LLC
5	Great place! Guys know there stuff if they don't know they will do everything to get the answer. We were running late on a Friday afternoon and needed to pick up some items they are closed on the weekend the waited for us to get there so we could get what we needed. Not only did the wait for us when we were there no hurry and go they got everything we needed to do our job for the weekend. Very reasonably priced and great service!
1	They don't order parts when you order them I waited four weeks to find out they didn't place the order. Wasted gas to drive there to find out the price quotes had tripled. Poor service. Acted as if they don't care if you give them business one way or another.
