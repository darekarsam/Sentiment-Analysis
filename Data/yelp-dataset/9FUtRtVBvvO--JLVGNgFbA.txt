3	Long wait each of the four times I have been here. We had to wait 45 minutes for a 15 minute visit with the doctor. The waiting room is clean and the staff is friendly. The doctor tries to take there time with you but is rushed. It like any other urgent care in the area, but its the closes for us.
1	was waiting here for a good hour.. could tell that the nurses could hear me wheezing and having trouble breathing they didn't seem to mind let alone acknowledge me. When I finally saw the doctor the service was much better.
5	Went to Surprise Family Urgent Care for an issue with my leg. The time I was there I waited about 15 minutes. Great staff and very pleased with the Drs. Recommend highly.
2	3 hours on a Sunday and I'm still in the waiting room. Was told it would be 1 hour to 1.5 hours due to only 1 doctor being in today. I'm not even in a room. Staff is friendly but the wait is horrific!
