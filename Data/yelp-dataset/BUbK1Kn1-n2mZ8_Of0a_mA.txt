5	Corey most certainly went the extra mile to make a sale for us on this house. He worked open houses, cooperated with other realtors, kept things moving and advised us with the offers that came in. He gets an A+ from us and we would most certainly employ him again.Richard and Nancy DeBusman
5	Corey helped me find a rental when I first moved to Phoenix, AZ. He is an amazing, big-hearted person who goes out of his way to help, make you feel comfortable and get things done quick. He is also very knowledgeable and extremely hard working.Its been 2 years since I moved to CA but I'll always remember Corey and wish him and his business all the very best!
5	Corey was great! He was very patient and worked hard for us as we went through the process of buying our first home with him. We used the Home in 5 grant, he knew the program and was able to help us find and purchase our home without much headache or expense. I appreciated that he was knowledgeable about the process and as we looked at homes together, he pointed out features and flaws in the homes and properties we were looking at that we might not otherwise have thought to look for. Thanks Corey!
