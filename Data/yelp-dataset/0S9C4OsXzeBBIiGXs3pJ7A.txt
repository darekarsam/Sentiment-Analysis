1	Went in with a voucher. Super friendly staff however The dentist was extremely condescending and criticized me throughout the visit. I thought he would be happy for a potential new patient. I have never been more uncomfortable in a medical office. Would steer clear of this place.
5	I am shocked at the previous review. We LOVE Dr. Valladares.  He is really friendly and thorough.  He will fully EXPLAIN what is going on in your mouth in a way no other dentist has ever done in my experience.  All 5 members of my family go to him and we couldn't be happier.
1	Dr. Valledares had done work on both me and my partner. We stopped going to him when he did a "tiny filling" (his words) on her and that evening she was in excruciating pain. When I finally reached him, he said he had to to a partial root canal but did not tell her because she was "upset."  She Had to go to an endodontist and ended up losing that tooth.  I just lost a crown he had put on. Went to my current dentist and he sent me to am endodontist to have the root canal checked before he put another crown on.  On Wednesday, I have to go back to have that root canal re-done because he did not do a complete job.  Nice guy, but not a great dentist.
