3	In my quest to exercise during the freezing weather, i'll go on long walks in the underground city.This part of the walk is always interesting.I start off at the basement at the bay's and can make it an almost loop to Metro Place des arts. It can be done in roughly an hour.I'm more into the food than the boutiques, we have one of our last Dunkin Donuts, a Mcdonalds, smoked meat shop, a couple of sushi joints and some middle eastern grub.There's a few coffee shops in the food court as well and the seats are pretty comfortable.I normally have a very good sense of direction, but not here for some reason, can never get where I want to go because all the exits and stores look alike to me. It can get very rushed at around 5pm, but it's nice and quiet afterwards.
