5	I was in a pinch and had a broken garage door and needed to get my car out.  I called Damon and he asked me a few questions to identify the problem, and was at my house in 30 minutes.  He replaced the broken spring, went the extra mile to lube and service the rest of the door, and another 30 minutes later I was on my way.  He knows his stuff and is local to Maricopa, so he keeps the trip cost down. I welcome anyone to contact me for a reference because I was impressed with his work.  Thank you Damon!
5	Great job! My door stopped working yesterday and it took one contact for him to come out today at 6:30 and get it fixed! I recommend him to anyone needed help.
5	I was very impressed with the service, price professionalism, and results of using this company. In fact I can't believe I put off getting my garage door fixed for so long, haha! Thanks so much for doing a great job, and giving me an honest price!!
