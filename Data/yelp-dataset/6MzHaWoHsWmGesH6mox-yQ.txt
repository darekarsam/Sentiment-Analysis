5	We confidently chose Yamira Rivera of YR Photography (www.yrphotography.com) for our photos, and she did not disappoint.  We had incredible photos from the entire wedding day--including bride & groom preparation, bridesmaids & groomsmen photos, wedding ceremony, family & bridal party photos, and reception-- within 10 days of the wedding date!  Yamira was hard-working, responsive to our requests, reasonably-priced/good value, and had an extremely quick turn-around time with quality editing of our photos.  You will not go wrong with this choice!
