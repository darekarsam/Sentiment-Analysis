1	It got delivered nearly 30 minutes late. The pizza was substandard.
1	Almost 2 hours for delivery...live less than 2 miles away.  Placed on hold when calling to confirm and stayed there for over 10 minutes only to have to call back. Calling this time to cancel order.
1	If I could give zero stars, I would. A delivery time of 4 hours? I don't understand what the issue is with this location. Also, I shouldn't have to call back 3 times after being put on hold and hung up on to cancel an order. Do not ever order from here.
1	This pizza hut is the worst I decided to give this location a try since the other pizza hut down the street always has issues. I picked up my pizza checked them it had so many toppings on there it was a mess. All I ordered was a pepperoni pizza. The cashier told me the website messed up my order. Smh. Then I guess what appeared to be a manager came over and said that I would have to wait on some more pizza. no type of apology or anything I just waited. Finally got my pizza the toppings were so skimpy I only had about 10 pepperonis on the whole pizza. Never again.
