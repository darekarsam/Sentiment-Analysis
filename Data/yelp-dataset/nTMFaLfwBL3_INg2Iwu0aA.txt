5	We came in last week for sick visits for my 2 year old son and 1 year old daughter. I was so impressed with the new staff and new business!! Sonia at the front desk kindly got me in within an hour of calling and made the process so simple for us (insurance info and new patient paperwork) We didn't have to wait long for Cassie to take us back and she helped my kids feel comfortable and at ease with being at the doctors! Dr. Weber is of course our all time favorite!! She is soooo good with the kids and treats us like family and not to mention I love how thorough  she is. She's been both my kids pediatrician since they were born and has loved and cared for them through it all! I am so happy about the new staff and the overall feel there. We left the office with everyone giving my kids well wishes to get feeling better and making us feel like we were so important to them :)
1	Im not sure if we just had a bad first impression or not but it seems as though we were wasting Dr. Webers time??  We went in for prescription  refills went to the pharmacy to pick them up and they were never faxed so now it seems as though we wasted or time. ..
5	We've been taking our kids to Dr. Weber for more than 3 years and love her!  I feel like she not only takes care of the kids, but really cares about them too.  She's knowledgeable and usually suggest the more simple solution first, which we really appreciate.  It's easy to make an appointment and they usually run on time.  Dr. Weber joined Bright Futures earlier this year and while the transition was a little bumpy with two new computer systems, the office is beginning to run more smoothly.  We're able to access all medical appointment notes from home which is awesome!  We definitely recommend her!!
