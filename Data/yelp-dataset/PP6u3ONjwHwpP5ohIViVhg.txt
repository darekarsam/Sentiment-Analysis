3	My mom found this place in 1998. She purchased a sapphire ring. It was a very nice ring and unique and she is very happy with it. The only issues I have is with the service and prices. I think the employees should be a little more attentive to customers and the prices could be a little more competitive.
4	The name says it all.  It literally is a small neighborhood jewellery store. The staff is always nice and friendly and the service is super quick. I take a few of my watches there to have batteries replaced about every 6 months. They do it right then and never takes more than 5 to 10 minutes.Their jewelry selection is limited, but the service is great. If you are looking for repair or quick battery replacement, they have always done a great job for me.
5	I used to manage a store next to Frank and Roberto's place before it was the Neighborhood Jewelers. They have been my go to jewelers for 8 years. From our wedding rings to birthday, valentines day, mothers, and fathers day, etc. they are always fair, will customize and repair, and will work hard to get you what you want in the budget you have. I really don't see my family or I ever going to another Jeweler. These guys are really amazing.
