2	Went around 5pm and didn't encounter a line which is quite astonishing.  For that I should be much more grateful than just 2 stars, but the service was quite odd there.  The woman at the counter just kept jumping to conclusions and trying to rush us out without any apparent reason.  We were trying to decide whether to refuse the package and have it returned to sender for free, or pay the fee to return it so that we could have a tracking number.  The result would be the same, but we would trade some security for essentially free shipping.  Well the lady just kept trying to do one thing without answering all of our questions.  Anyways, when I left I couldn't help but think I did the wrong thing -- never a good feeling when you leave any business.  They also don't have an automated postage machine that you could use to mail packages without going to the counter or perhaps use after hours.  Perhaps they close the lobby afterwards, therefore one of those machines is not necessary, who knows, hope others have better service.
3	This Post Office is okay.  No automated machines.  Huge parking lot.  Located near a Food Lion,Goodwill,and a Hess gas station.  The employees are decent and somewhat polite.  If you don't feel like waiting in a huge line then this would be the Post Office to drive too.
1	The people who work here are very rude and mean. Once you paid your money, they treat you like trash. They don't even want to talk to you! This happened twice to me when I try to get my refund for my delayed PM international mail. I also called USPS customer service and was hold on the line for almost one hour before I had to hang up. Who knows how long it will take. I feel frustrated and don't know what I can do now. I may never use USPS again.
