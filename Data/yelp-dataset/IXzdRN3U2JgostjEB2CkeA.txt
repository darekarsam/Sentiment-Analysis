3	I was told this place had amazing sandwiches, decided to stop in today. I got a sandwich combo with coleslaw and fries. Others got a chicken breast with fries and coleslaw.It's a small fast foody type joint. Very nice server and reasonable price. But honestly I found the chicken/sandwich very underwhelming. It just tasted like a plain chicken sandwich. No real unique or amazing flavor. Felt alright and healthy, but definitely not "delicious" etc. Its an alright place to try, doubtful I'd return though.
4	When you are in the mood for a Portuguese chicken sandwich it's good to be on Boulevard St. Laurent, especially in the vicinity of Avenue du Mont-Royal. Rotisserie Kiri Piri is located is on the corner. The warm simple space is well organized and neatly presented. I initially ordered the classic roasted chicken sandwich with signature taste of its own drippings, with mayo and a touch of their house hot sauce on a simple soft bun (I only added black pepper from a packet). The combination (though not complex) is very tasty and fills you up just enough to be able to fit semi-sweet rich and creamy egg tart called 'Natas'. Both items totaled about $8.00, which is a little expensive for just two simple items, but these two are excellent ones.The street view from the corner window table is somewhat entertaining and isn't the worst place to read or write while eating. There are several Portuguese rotisserie joints in the area, and though it's not a write home place, this basic one holds it's own; chicken sandwich for chicken sandwich.PS They sell their hot sauce by the jar at the counter.
