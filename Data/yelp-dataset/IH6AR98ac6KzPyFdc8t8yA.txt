3	All of UPMC was elated when we got a Starbucks in the hospital. Walk down and back up cardiac hill just for non-cafeteria coffee?? No thank you! The line can get long, but it moves pretty fast. They've got breakfast pastries and sandwiches, little salads and snacks, and a wall of retail. Be warned, though, that this location commonly does not participate in regular Starbucks promotions.
5	Great addition to UMPC!  Let's face it, when you are at UPMC, it's usually not for something good.  I was here because a family member was at the ER.  Having access to a full service Starbucks, complete with seating is an Oasis!   It allows people to come get some comfort food or just a quick caffeine fix and relax for a few minutes.  The seating area is nice and off set from the hospital (helps you forget that you are in a hospital).  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  This Starbucks provided me a nice break. .or distraction . .from a very bad day.  Great idea Starbucks and UMPC!
5	Such a great place to have a Starbucks and even better service! The workers at this location are awesome! They are funny, give great service, and are very sweet. Over the past few days while I've been at Presby with my dad for his surgery, they were great! I'm so glad they are so cheerful and positive. They truly made this visit better with their smiling faces! Thank you!!
