5	This is a wonderfully well operated restaurant - run by an amazingly hospitable family.  The food, drink, and atmosphere were everything I hoped for - a fantastic place to celebrate a special occasion.
5	Incredible restaurant. A little out of the way and the neighborhood looks sketchy but the most welcoming couple own the restaurant and they'll spend half an hour explaining the menue to you in detail.  We LOOOVED this place
3	Food was good but not great.  Over salted and portions out of balance for a tasting menu.  I wanted to really like this place but I won't be back, with all the phenomenal options in Montreal.  The service was really spotty, and our server basically told us what we wanted instead of having a conversation, which ended up with my friend ending up with a bottle of wine she didn't choose, and a charge for her to have the last glass paired with our meal (we both paid for the pairing), all because we told him she didn't like red wines.
