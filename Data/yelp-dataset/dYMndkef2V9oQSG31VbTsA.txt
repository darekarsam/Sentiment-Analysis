5	Brooke is the best.  I started going to her about 6 months before my wedding just so I could get to know her.  (I'm fussy with my hair.)  She is honestly one of the nicest people I know.  She is an excellent hair dresser.  My hair looked perfect on my wedding day and it stayed in most of the night.  Some of the pins started popping out towards 8 pm because I was bouncing all around.  Brooke and her sister, Arbor, came to my house and did everyone's hair.  Arbor was also awesome.  She put extensions on one of my maids her and it looked perfect.  Even my mother-in-law was satisfied with her up-do!!!  (she has short hair)  The prices are great, too!
5	Brooke is amazing. Normally when you get a haircut from a salon owner it costs a lot of money but I've never paid more than $30 for a haircut from Brooke. It looks perfect every time! I've also had my nails done with Amber and they came out great the two times I got them done. This is an excellent, small place. It's also convenient to downtown so I usually go over after getting off work!
4	Brooke did both my hair (and my mom and maid of honor) for my wedding!We were a pretty simple group (I was the easiest of all of them- all I really wanted was a professional blowout) but she listened to what all of us had to say.  She was professional and punctual but still kind and worked well with my makeup artist.  The pair of them tag-teamed us and all 3 of us were done within an hour or so.I was very happy with how all 3 styles turned out.Strongly recommend her for any brides looking for a stylist.  I can't comment on her cuts or color though!
