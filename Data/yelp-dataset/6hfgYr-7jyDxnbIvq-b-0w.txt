3	Fairly big GetGo, but such an odd location.  Opening up it did close down a gas station down the street.  Plenty of pumps so even during a rush you should be able to get in and get your gas in a hurry.  The inside, even though it is a larger location, doesn't feel too big.  It actually feels like everything is jammed in there.  It's not hard to actually bump into somebody and not even mean to do it.3 stars, yeah, 3 stars it is.
3	This is my preferred GetGo in the area. I work in West Mifflin and live in Brentwood. I would go out of my way to go to this location sooner than the Brentwood location. What I like about his GetGo is the lot. It's big, and you don't feel like at any second someone is going to hit you, like a lot of gas station parking lots. I've never had to wait for a pump, even at a busy time. The cat wash is quick, though not always the best. Even with an expensive wash, sometimes I'm left feeling like a wasted my money. It's good if you want your car washed quick in a pinch. I'm not a fan of the way the inside is set up compared to other GetGos, but that's my only real complaint.
