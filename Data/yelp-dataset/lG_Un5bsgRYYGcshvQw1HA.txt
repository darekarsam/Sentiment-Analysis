5	East West MMA has a Quality Program for people of all ages and genders. They teach true Mixed Martial Arts which includes various types of kick-boxing and strikes, the Self Defense (which is efficient and effective), JuJitsu and conditioning. It is a Family atmosphere and fun! Our whole family has earned our Black Belts there in MMA and My son and I are earning our Blue Belts in JJ! The Owner, Master Fiori (He has multiple Black Belts in various arts) is awesome and can help you decide which program is best for you or your family. The JJ is taught by World Champion Blackbelt Carlos Farias and they offer Gi and No Gi. They have over 4000 square feet of matt space and the place is kept very clean. I like how it is conveniently located right off the 202 at Power and McDowell, NW corner by the Bashas.
1	Complete lack of integrity and honesty! Buyer Beware. The owner Derek Frader will lie, cheat and steal to make anything to his advantage.
