1	This place is part of what is wrong with the system!!
1	The only factor that made this place ever worth mentioning in a posiitive manner it's the Mgr. Alex. He treats people with nothing but respect. He does what he has to yet leaves me with more dignity than any type of subcontracted company that is yet anotehr tool of the system. I was there when he prevented a guy from physically attacking one of the other employees without any force. He knows how to handle himself professionally while respecting the community.
3	I've never had an issue with the staff being rude to me. However my first few times were violating. There's a two way mirror and they can see you but you can't see them. They make you pull your pants all the way down to the ground!!All the girls are nice though, but at first glance it's sketchy and really makes you want to straighten up. I honestly feel like I could get mugged walking from my car to the testing center. They should make another location in Scottsdale that is safer.
