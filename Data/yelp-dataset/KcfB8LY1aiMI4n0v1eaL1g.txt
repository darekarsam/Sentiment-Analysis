4	It's a nice, clean store.  It has bright, wide aisles.  They have lots of holiday items and Illini gear.  It's 24 hours so pretty convenient.  I vary between here and the CVS down the street...  haven't paid too much attention to who has the better deals.  They seem pretty equivalent.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Okay, I have decided that Walgreens is cheaper than CVS.
4	As the previous reviewer Bailey stated - nice clean store, brightly lit.I wanted one of those soft cloths for cleaning eyeglass - they had none. I had to buy a package (30 count) of these wet eyeglass wipes in the foil packs. Also picked up some Rolaids as I ran out, and a comb to replace my missing comb.
4	It's Walgreens.  It's a clean Walgreen's.  The Pharmacy people are always very helpful and that I appreciate.
1	I love your shop, but that new guy behind the pharmacy counter needs to go. He has made so many mistakes and wasted so much time, because he doesn't know what he's doing. What happened to training and quality? The guy is messing with people's prescriptions and it's not the time to discover that. I'm sorry, but if he doesn't go, I cannot trust my medication with someone who is going to mess it up. I told him that my insurance changed, and 20 minutes later, guess what, your insurance changed. Seriously! And then they say do this, and it doesn't work. I don't know what to do.
1	Very bad workers need to get there story straight before they take action accusing people wrongly. Going to tell everyone I know about that incident that happened.  That will ruin your business. I always shopped there very clean store but never again. You don't go around accusing people stealing. That poor person that got searched and came out clean by cops use your damn cameras before you do shit like that
