4	Dead battery in Las Vegas... My first call was to AAA, they processed my call, 24 minutes later the yellow truck pulled up, Alan was at the wheel. The service was excellent! The driver, Alan, was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. He made our situation less stressful, effortless as he replaced my battery. I highly recommend AAA's Auto Guardian in Las Vegas. Thank you Alan!
5	Very pleased with an otherwise unpleasant experience. Las Vegas heat plus my procrastination equals dead battery. Called AAA and they sent out Auto Guardian. 35 minutes after call the truck was there. The guy Moises was very personable and friendly. He checked the battery and it was dead. Offered to put in a new one. Standing in a parking lot in 110 degree heat that was a no brainier. He had my battery changed quickly and I was on my way. Overall very pleased, Moises was great.
5	My review is for the driver JASON DILLARD.   my car would not start at the MGM Grand. Luckily I had AAA roadside assistance. I had to wait about an hour because it was late on a Saturday night. But when Jason arrived he helped me try to start my car. Unfortunately it was not something as simple as the battery, there was something else wrong.  But Jason Towed me and my car home safely. He was friendly and knowledgeable. Jason made my situation less stressful and he was fun to talk to.  I highly recommend AAA's Auto Guardian in Las Vegas. Thank you Jason!
