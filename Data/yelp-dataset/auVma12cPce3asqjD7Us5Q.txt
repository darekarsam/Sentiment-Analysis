4	Nice inland course , not hilly but a definate test for all levels. Clubhouse is modern and large with good food and choice of drinks , pro shop very well stocked. Not expensive to play either with very good deals on society gold days.
5	We had a wonderful day today at the course in Duddingston. My Dad and I decided to play at the last minute and didn't have clubs! No worries they provided a nice set of Taylor Made clubs. Beautiful views from many of the holes. Course is challenging on a few holes (several long Par 4's), but very forgiving and nice fairways to target. Also very reasonably priced. Would play here again without a doubt. My Dad was very pleased with the course, one of the best in Edinburgh he said.Highly recommend for those who want a nice course, great hospitality and a lot of beautiful holes.
