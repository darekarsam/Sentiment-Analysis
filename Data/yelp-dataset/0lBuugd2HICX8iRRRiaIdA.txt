5	I have moved many times in the last several years and this was the first time the process of finding a new place felt easy and effortless. Marissa leased me a place in the Veer building and I love it! I've never felt like a real estate agent has worked so hard to help me find the right place. The process was so quick and painless! I actually had fun looking for my new home - it was stress free! I love Veer and its amazing amenities/location. Thank you thank you Marissa for all your help!
5	Marissa was the best. We were working on a quick timeline to relocate to Las Vegas from Florida. She met us on short notice and arranged several showings. She shepherded us through the process and made sure everything went smoothly. I highly recommend Marissa for a worry-free transaction.
5	I was looking to purchase a vacation condo in Las Vegas and did not have much time to do so. Marissa worked extremely hard to find me exactly what I wanted and in a time frame that worked perfectly for me. She is very professional and definitely one of the best agents I've worked with. I would highly recommend her and plan on utilizing her services again in the future. Definitely a pleasure to do business with.
