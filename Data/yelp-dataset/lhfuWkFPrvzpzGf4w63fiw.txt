We didn't get attacked, which is important to say, because the negatives should be balanced by at least one positive. Owner was nice enough, and at $45, it was the cheapest last minute option. The lesson: make prior arrangements elsewhere for the love of god.
1	Wow, this place is awful. I unfortunately saw this as two stars on kayak. It's a lot more like 0.0. If you have a choice. DONT DO IT.
5	this was a last minute trip to Arizona and we quickly for this room for a good reasonable price.
