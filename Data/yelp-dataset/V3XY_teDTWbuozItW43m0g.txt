5	Talk about professionals!  This is a one stop shop for anyone that needs medical supplies and equipment.  I used them when I broke my ankle and the VP of Sales, Keith Quarles was the best! He got me on a scooter instead of using those horrible crutches!  I didn't even know that was an option!  I could get around with ease!He is an expert in negative pressure wound therapy and understands the needs that bedridden and diabetics have like no other.  He can also recommend doctors in the area to meet your special needs.  I learned more than I ever knew existed. I brought my mom there for her spinal cord injury and her needs, and they set her uplFrom compression therapy,  blood pressure monitors, braces and diagnostic equipment, if they don't have it, they can get it for you!Easy location on 90th st. across from the Fry's Marketplace.  Easy parking!Call and ask for Keith or Marc (the owner) and they will take care of you!

5	Great prices and excellent customer service.  What a nice combination!  I was dealing with another supplier for a CPAP machine and discovered a wonderful difference in attitude.  I needed to make the switch quickly and they went way out of their way to meet me 45 minutes away and get a machine to me the same day.  They obviously go the extra mile.
