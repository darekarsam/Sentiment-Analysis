5	modern vintage that only hipsters can curate.want is filled with beautifully designed goods from high quality swedish items from labels such as nudie or acne.  this shop has the word gorgeous-ness defined.  from body care items to old fashioned grooming kits, want is a well lit treasure trove.  it's what ralph lauren aspires to be.you'd think the neighborhood would have a snobbish feel but the people who work there are warm and passionate about the products.  sure to hit the wallet, want has items you will "want" to have or to treat someone else to a fabulous gift.  i love, i love.
4	Pricey, chi chi imported clothing/accessory/cosmetics store. Here is where one would go if one has the cash & yen for very expensive imported jeans, shirts, sweaters, bags and costume jewelry, etc. This is also the only place in town that stocks the full Australian skin/haircare line "Aesop". Stock very neatly and  accesibly laid out, whole store well lit, staff not snotty or pushy, even the skin/hair care products are easily accessibe for you to test. Have cash will buy.
