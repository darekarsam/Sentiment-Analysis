4	Delicious delicious chicken! Mary Brown's offers something different from the mainstream KFC or Popeye's chicken.  Their Big Mary sandwich is delicious, although recently it seems they stopped putting the pickle slice (the "crown") on top of their burgers. It's a shame, it gave it just a little bit of kick.Their seasoned wedges are also delicious.
2	A disappointing experience. There appeared to be only one employee working during the lunch rush, since there was one employee running orders and making food at the same time.  Service was thus very slow. Near the end of my order I could see another employee on the phone in the back.The Big Mary sandwich had a delicious chicken breast but the bun was overly steamed and not crispy or toasted.  I asked for their awesome potato wedges but instead received regular, undercooked, bland fries.I expected better.
4	The food was rather delicious, kinda like a balance between kfc and popeyes. We ordered 9 pieces of chicken only and they were really crispy and flavourful. The pieces of the chicken bodies were massive, kinda like twice as big as the wings. The service speed was ok, but the service kinda had a hard time hearing things, either because he didn't speak a lot of english or he had hearing problems. Overall the trip was satisfying
