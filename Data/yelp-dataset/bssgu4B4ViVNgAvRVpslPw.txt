3	I'm not sure what Dunkin Donuts specialty is but since I had a coupon for a meal, that's what I ordered. I got myself a Big N Toasted meal. The Big 'N Toasted is a breakfast sammich that has a fried egg, cheese, and bacon surrounded by buttered toast. The sammich was alright, but the bread was pretty good. The hash browns are more like watered down tater tots. Without the coupon, I felt like these meals are pretty overpriced (this meal would have cost $7 without the coupon).
1	I'm not happy about the blatant false advertisement that is displayed about this Dunkin Donuts. I saw several "Open 24 hour" signs so I proceeded to use the drive thru. While I was making my decision, the attendant was irritated and told me that they close in 2 minutes. I asked for some chocolate donuts. Then he proceeded to rush me by listing a whole bunch of donuts as fast as he could. I couldn't even understand what he said so I told him that I just wanted a normal chocolate donut. In the end, I didn't get a normal chocolate donut. And the princess was not saved. Bad end.

1	Love DD. Hate this location. They always seem annoyed with you for being there. They don't make the chocolate eclaires here and there is no way the donuts I got on Sunday morning were fresh. I gave it a few tries and I am done with this location. To bad the other one is across town. Looks like no more donuts for me.
