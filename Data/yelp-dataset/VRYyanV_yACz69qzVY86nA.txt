5	I've been coming to David and Holly's gym since September, when they moved to their new location on Acoma Drive. I love the privacy of the gym, along with the excellent training (hard, but worth it) and their encouraging words. They have pushed me and I love how much stronger I have gotten in the last few months. They are always changing up the routine so that I don't get bored and they always know when I can do more and push myself harder.  A first class facility with excellent trainers.
