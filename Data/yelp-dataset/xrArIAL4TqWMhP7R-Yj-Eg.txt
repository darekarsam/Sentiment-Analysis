4	This is a nice laid back place to get a nice haircut for under $20.    I think its around $16.. I'm not sure because I always just give Claude a twenty. Now I dont have much hair and aint too fussy,but my friend Mike gets his cut here and he has a good head and is very fussy.So methinks if Mike is happy then the haircuts are done well.
5	My husband needed a clean up and came across this True barber style cuts!! Definitely a place to get a cut... See Daniel he will hook it up!!!
3	I walked half an hour to get to this place and it was closed.  Early December during normal business hours.  No explanation or note on door.  I didn't want to skew the ratings so I gave it 3 stars based on other reviews.Mske sure you call ahead before you go.
