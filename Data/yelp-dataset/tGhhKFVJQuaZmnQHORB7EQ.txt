4	Wanna feel and smell like a million bucks? This is not your place, Bella Pella products will make you smell like a delicious sorbet, fresh and fragrant, and feel like you just got pampered. I imagine the smell and feel of a million dollars can be rough, and dirty, and a bit smelly in a not good way.  (chirp...chirp...chirp...) we can't always be funny.It's a local company, and this particular storefront, I find absolutely pretty! I like it a lot better than the one in Eaton's Centre because is bigger, and naturally lit from outdoors. (I avoid malls often) My favourites are the lemonade body scrub and the earl grey, the shower gels, and the hand cream. The body scrub is a great thing to have for the winter time as it helps exfoliate! I have also tried the scented oils, which I use in a diffuser for making the apt smell happy. I think it's a great gift for moms, ladies and girls, and the scents aren't the same as what you'd find in Body Shop, or Lush etc. It's particularly great for out of towners gifts because it is uniquely from here.
