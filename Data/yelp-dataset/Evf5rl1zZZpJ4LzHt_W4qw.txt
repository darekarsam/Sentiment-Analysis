5	I'm updating my review of Appetite to five stars because, frankly, having tried other places in the area, it really is exceptional. Due to an office move, I'm not there as often as I'd like. I miss the amazing soups and sandwiches, and I'm trying to come up with inventive reasons for taking a two-hour lunch break in order to satisfy my addict-like needs. So while I can't go, you should. You won't be disappointed.
