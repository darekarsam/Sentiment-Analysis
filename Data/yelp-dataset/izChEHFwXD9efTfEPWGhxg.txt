5	The service I received here was excellent.  Had my bike refurbished - tires etc...  The staff was patient with my questions.     Thanks to Mike and his wonderful staff!
5	Mike's is a great place to go for any of your bicycle needs. The owners are super nice and incredibly knowledgable (so is the staff). They don't try and rip you off like other places. They always go above and beyond to with any bike repairs, and the prices are fair. I would highly recommend going to Mike's over other bike shops.
5	I have been a customer of bike chalet and subsequently mike's bike chalet for 20 or so years. I'm a baby boomer and remember America before the "big box" culture of today. most American retail was independent businesses like mike's bike chalet. the point, at mike's you get staff that really knows bikes. you get respect and courtesy. (watch how mike works with his staff, he treats them like he treats his customers, with respect and patience). another factor that keeps me a steady customer is mike makes attempts to offer you choices on how to proceed with the repair. choices of different costs for parts, how about a used tire, whatever......the only drawback of bike stores is the choices are usually limited on brands they carry. so if you buy a bike elsewhere at least consider mike's for your ongoing repairs, maintenance.  mike really knows bikes, and seems to have a pulse on what your wallet can handle!
