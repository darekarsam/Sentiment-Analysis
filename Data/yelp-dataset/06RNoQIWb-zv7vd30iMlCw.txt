5	This place is great. Just like when would juice at home. It makes you feel good and gets you going for the day. I hope you love it like I do.
1	I may be the only one to have bad experiences with this place, but I'm never happy with them. I've been twice. Once, I never got my drink. I ordered at the front of a long line. Everyone in line after me got their drinks and left and I was still waiting. In an empty store. You'd think someone would've noticed me. Nope. Had to talk to the unfriendly girls at the counter and they didn't even apologize, they were too busy worrying about whether or not I paid for my drink. On my second trip there, I was left drinkless again because apparently someone else grabbed my drink, they said. So they remade it. Maybe they should try calling order names aloud ALL the time instead of only sometimes to avoid this situation? Anyways, nektar is always a disappointing hassle. Their juice is good but I'm never prepared to go through that kind of trauma and frustration for something I can make at home.
1	Update: went to nektar again the other day (hoping they'd prove me wrong about their customer service skills) and I probably stood in front of the register for about 10 minutes while 2 girls behind the counter talked and completely ignored me. Not even so much as a "we'll be with you in a moment." Just pretended I wasn't there.
1	I really love their juices here but their customer service makes you not want to ever come back.  All 3 times I've been here the teenage girls act like they are doing you a favor by taking your order.  Usually takes 10+ minutes to get anything even if there is nobody else here.  They are just busy in the back gossiping.
