4	Being that this is the only fast food that is easily accessible between Uptown and Sardis Road, I have to stop here frequently to get my daughter something to eat before dance practice.  We always go through the drive-through.  Service is always excellent and the wait time is minimal.  I can't complain when her stomach is growling (which it does frequently) as Arby's fits the bill.
1	I have been here a few times but this time will be my last. I order the same thing as usual a market fresh sandwich and I was shocked when I got home and saw the little amount of meat I received for just over $8. Normally this sandwich is piled high with ham... so disappointed and still hungry. I had to combine both halves to make a normal half sandwich. I wont be back too inconsistent.
4	Quick dinner after climbing with my girlfriend at the nearby Inner Peaks climbing gym.  I got a market fresh sandwich and she got french dip.  No one else was in there on a Monday night, and service was decent (not fast or slow).  The food was good, though they put an excessive amount of ranch on the chicken bacon ranch sandwich I had.  Food is better than most fast food and reasonably quick and clean.  Would visit again when needing a quick dinner.
