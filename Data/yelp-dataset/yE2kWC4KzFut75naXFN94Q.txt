5	My battery died this morning so I got it jumped and headed over to the closest place that sold batteries--it happened to be AutoZone.  I had a great experience with the friendly staff--Hunter was very helpful with his recommendations on which battery to purchase.  Then I found out that they install the battery for free and recycle the dead one.  I was in and out of there in about 15 minutes.  And with the 5 year warranty on the battery, I won't be paying for another battery for long time.  Couldn't recommend coming here more if you're having battery issues.
5	I decided to check what Auto Zone had in stock for floormats, steering wheel cover & shade screen for my new car before heading over to Walmart, and I'm sooooo glad I did! Their pricing was the SAME and they carry a much larger selection of quality brands. You'd think there wouldn't be much attention to decorative items for a car in an auto parts store, but there was a genuine effort to make sure I would be happy with the colors I was considering, & even encouraged to take them out to the car and look at them with the interior. Because of this, I actually selected items that look like they're made for this car,  giving it a very comfortable and elegant effect. The young man helping me said he'd been in auto detailing before becoming a mechanic, and because of his help and the wide selection to choose from, I'm enjoyng my new car even MORE! Good luck finding that kind of service or selection at Walmart!
5	So thankful for Bob and Danny installing my new car battery tonight!! So appreciated!
