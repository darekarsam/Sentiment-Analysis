4	I like Great Clips. Their prices are reasonable, they have coupons often, I never have to wait long, I can (now) check on online, and their computer system remembers what the stylist did last time so i don't have to explain it to whoever is working that day.It's just a no-hassle place to get a decent haircut. Nothing fancy. Every one in a while I get a stylist that doesn't listen well, or doesn't do exactly what I want...but I've never left there feeling like they completely botched the job.If you're sick of paying for expensive haircuts, give these guys a shot.
1	If I could give no stars, I would!I've been using this type of "fast food" haircut places all my life (ie Supercuts, Great Clips, etc) and have never really had an issue. I get haircuts about once every three or four weeks. So the other day I was stopping by Fry's to get some groceries and saw this Great Clips, so I went in for a trim. Krystal took me to her chair. I explained what I wanted; clean up the sides and back. She worked on it for about 5 minutes  and said she was done. Uh... no, she barely cut anything. I pointed out a few areas I wanted trimmed up. She seemed annoyed like I was insulting her work. She grabbed her clippers and then hacked away. Looks like I got a buzz cut for a 5 year old. I was upset, but just paid and left. I'll never go there again!
