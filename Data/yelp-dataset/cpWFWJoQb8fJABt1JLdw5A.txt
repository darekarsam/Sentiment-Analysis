1	Wow. The short version is that the gelato is terrible, the softserve not great and the service atrocious. Below is the review of TWO occasions. Truly this is the only "mistake" in Bloomfield.I stopped in Sugar Cane late last fall for some ice cream. A friend and I tried a few flavors of the gelato but it wasn't very good, especially compared to Mercurio's. We got some softserve, which wasn't bad. The staff was rushed and impatient; I didn't mind since they it wasn't terrible or rude service, just unprofessional.I returned a few weeks later at the encouraging "$1 ice cream!" sign outside. I should have known better - if the place is empty and NOT brand new and the weather is fine, something is wrong!This time the staff was different and all-out hostile. This time I was there with a different friend, who asked to sample the gelato. Not thrilled with it, she went with the soft serve "special", as I did. I asked for it in a cup. The staffer was incredibly huffy, rolling her eyes and telling me it "would be a bit" to turn the machine on. Slightly miffed, we decided to wait. Finally served, it's watery and separating the milk from the cream. She rings us up and it's $4. I said "I think it should be 2 something, we got the special". She screamed "ONy IN A CONE!". I asked why we weren't told that, then were told "That special is over". At that exact moment, another staffer was erasing the inside chalk board where it was written -- keep in mind that the outside chalkboard was still advertising it!I was stunned. To top it off, I asked to speak with the manager, hoping they could be made aware of their employees' terrible attitudes. "I'm the owner, okay" whined the woman behind the counter.Eeesh. Tasteless gelato, crappy softserve, horrible service on two occasions.As Monty Python would say, "Run away! Run away!"
