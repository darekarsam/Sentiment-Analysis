4	I have lived in a few of the units here over the last 8 years. This place is always quiet and the grounds are always kept clean. The prices here are hard to beat for what you get. Each place I have been in has had 2 1/2 bathrooms (both 2 and 3 bedroom units) and attached two car garages. The living rooms and kitchens all have the vaulted ceilings, giving them a nice spacious feel. The units are all well kept and maintained, I have never been disappointed.I have had very few maintenance needs over the years due to the higher quality appliances used in the units. The few times I have required maintenance help, they have responded quickly to fix, repair, or replace what ever I need without any fuss.The manager Kyle has been here for as long as I have been in this area. She is very friendly and always willing to chit chat when she is available. She always seams to be willing to bend over backwards to help others out. She is very flexible when it comes to scheduling meetings and appointments and goes out of her way to meet your needs. My only complaint about this area is it is not a gated community. Other then that, I have enjoyed my time here and plan to stay here until I decide to buy my own property, and I do recommend this area to others.
1	Loved living here....for the past 6 years...always quiet and safe. Until there was a shooting last night that they arent doing anything about...I wouldnt move here because the safety of the tenants is not a priority
