2	This place is way to expensive for the product and service they deliver. I dropped of two simple women's blouses and the bill was over $13! The gal behind the counter when I dropped off and pick up seems miserable! She refuses to make eye contact and is impossible to chat with. I will be looking for friendlier service with a much more reasonable price tag.
2	For the price, I expect very good service.  However, consistently they do not pick up my clothes when I schedule them to.  When this happens, I am forced to wait another 4 days or bring the clothes in myself.  Not sure where the disconnect is but they need to get this piece figured out!
5	Dropped off about 10 shirts to get cleaned and they came out perfect.   Counter lady isn't that friendly but the service is awesome.   I will use them for now on.
5	Got blood out of my Burberry polo! This place is amazing! Got everything out! Saved me $140! Best $6 I ever spent! If I lived in AZ this would be my go to place! Thanks Brad!
