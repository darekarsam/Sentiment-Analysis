1	Stay away from this business. They will not respond to your calls or emails nor will they respond to TeamBuy when they try to contact them on your behalf. After waiting 32 weeks, they could not even deliver the 1st of 5 shirts paid for. Their storefront no longer exists.
1	This company is a scam.  I purchased 5 shirts...went for the fitting, paid the taxes, and 5 months later, still nothing after dozens of calls and emails.  The store front is gone.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!
5	It's weird, I've had a great experience! ....I wonder if we can find he's phone number, I wanted to order more shirts. At that price, it's worth it!I discover the custom and it is really impressive. Shirts fit me perfectly! I would buy only that now!
