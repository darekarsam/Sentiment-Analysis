3	Decent food court option: it's pricey like airport food, though. $8+ for a large sandwich, $4 to add a small drink/fry, $6 for a regular drink/fry add-on. It gets pricey fast.But on the bright side, the cheesesteaks are actually pretty tasty. Your choice of cheese, several combinations of mushrooms, peppers, onions, etc. You can also customize fries and add cheese, gravy, chili, and other toppings. Not a place to hit on a diet.
1	Food is okay. Was sandbagged with a $27 bill for a steak and fries bowl, and sandwich. Careful when ordering!!!!
2	Went to the outlet mall in search of a cafe that was nowhere to be found. One of the mall's finest recommended Steak and Fries and raved about it. I guess you can't blame a guy for talking up the very place he is paid to protect, but this place was not good. At best it was fast food quality at restaurant prices in a food court. They were not busy by any stretch, but had six cackling employees behind the counter carrying on like geese in heat. Their mating calls could be heard echoing throughout the food court. The food took too long and my bacon cheeseburger was just "middle of the road." The fries were decent, but only warm. I was expecting hot, fresh fries. No such luck. Lunch for two was thirty bucks! There were a few other options inside the food court but you might be better off leaving the property for lunch if this place is any indication of how the other eateries are.Only two stars this go round. The service, food quality and price all combined to make this a disappointing experience.
