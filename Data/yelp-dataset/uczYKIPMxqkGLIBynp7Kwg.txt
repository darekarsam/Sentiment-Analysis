2	Ran over here for a quick lunch. I had the gyro which another worker said he picked up as well. I have had quite a few gyro's (pronounce gy-ro here for some reason; east coast thing?) so I do have some experience eating these things.It wasnt exactly what I expected. I agree with the previous review that the meat did taste a little funny. But the white sauce... I hope you sure like garlic, because it was a heavy garlic sour cream thing that was pretty runny. It was very large (more than I could handle) so I ate about half. The pita was pretty tasty though...
2	I bought a Reuben and fries to go around 8 pm on a Sunday night; both were super greasy, even for Pittsburgh. (I lived here for 6 years and know Pittsburgh greasy). Yeah, I know, I ordered a Ruben, but sandwiches shouldn't make spongey noises when you pick it up!
5	Excellent service personable and decent food
4	This joint is the saving grace of Station Square. It is dirt cheap and doesn't hide behind a fake wall of pretension. The guys behind the counter are really great and pleasant to talk to. The food is cafeteria style decent and priced really well. I was staying at the Sheraton and there is no way in hell I would purchase any of their overpriced food nor was I going to gouge myself in the surrounding crap-hole chains surrounding it. I don't even care what they're called Steeler's cafe or Island Cafe whatever as long as they make a straight no frills breakfast with two eggs, toast and bacon for a couple of bucks whatever!
