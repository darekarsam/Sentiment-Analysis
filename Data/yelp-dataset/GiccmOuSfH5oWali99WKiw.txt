4	Hear ye hear ye, a new outpost of the mini Montreal chain of organic, gluten free, health food stores called Mondiana's just popped up in Jean Talon Market. Dietarily needy? Rejoice! The market has finally getting a great diversity of options for you. I am still a fan of Merci Mere Nature over in the opposite corner of the market, but walking around Mondiana's I was thrilled to see all kinds of local Quebec organic products that were new to me. And even more glee: there is a pizza counter inside, and a soon to be salad bar, and a BBQ and tables outside for local, gluten free saucisses in the sun when the time comes... and it is coming!
4	I'm a big fan of this place - the selection is great and since I've quit glutens (and legumes and corn and rice -oh my!) it's been very helpful. Their hours are great (8-8) considering most of the stores in the Jean Talon market close early. The staff is very friendly. They also have a very large selection of natural beauty/hair products which I've yet to try.  A note : don't get your essentials there unless you really mean to (you'll find them cheaper somewhere else) and unless the fresh produce they sell outside says "organic", don't assume it is.
3	Ok I have to say it: sometimes the service here is just the worst. Not malicious, just incomprehensibly detached from reality. Aggressively helpful or just nowhere to be found. Generally nice but oddballs. When I put my finger on it I'll let you know.
