4	Like Stephanie, I initially felt this shop was a little outmoded - it reminds me a little of what Laura Ashley and Monsoon were selling in the mid 90s.Inside, it's a different story. It's a delightful boutique geared towards an older style of fashion and a slightly older audience. The dresses and coat sets are timelessly fashionable, lending their inspiration from the elegance of the 50s. Some of the hats and skirts reminded me of how Audrey Hepburn looked in My Fair Lady when she was parading around at Ascot.The cocktail dresses look like they'd fit like a glove, and are all very high quality. They are priced accordingly, but it would definitely be worth it if you were going to a wedding.Places like Chique are few and far between these days, but it's great that this little boutqiue still exists as it has the older fashioned manner of customer service (i.e it's friendly and personal!), and the dresses are gorgeous. If I was getting married I'd usher my mum in here.
