3	This little mall quick restaurant was right by our hotel- and was a nice inexpensive break from most Vegas food. The two people working were very kind despite having no air in 100+ heat which is more than I would be able to give in that heat. The bourbon chicken and orange chicken were good. Fried rice was very bland.Pluses: quick, good tasting, friendly serviceNegatives: seating area was very dirty
3	I'm staying on the Strip, I need someplace reasonably priced to eat lunch, I don't want to go far, and I want it to be easy to take it back to the room.   Thank you China Max for fulfilling my needs!
4	Looking for something to eat real quick and not too pricy before we head to events and we came across this hidden gem. Hearty portions. We had the #2. Two choices is noodles. Bourbon chicken and orange chicken. If you check in you get 10% off. So win win. My bf and I shared the plate and we got full. Good place to stop for a quick and affordable lunch. The food itself was good too! I'm giving it four stars just because no free refills.
