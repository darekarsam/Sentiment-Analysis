5	Hi! Just wanted to give serious props to the ladies at Blue Raven Boutique! I took my HPB to the Container Park to meet up with some friends/shop/eat and had a totally excellent time in their store :) Everything was priced right, they had a great selection of cute stuff (including a wall of sunglasses under 8 bucks SQUEE), their staff is friendly and the store is adorable with a great view! We will definitely be going back!! Thanks for having us ladies!!
5	I went to Container Park for the first time to see what all the buzz was about. My gal pals and I checked out all the shops, but Blue Raven was one in particular that stood out as super cute and hip. Very reasonably priced, and in addition to women's apparel they have some cool gift ideas for everyone! This is one store that, as a local, I would drive downtown to visit as my destination.
5	I absolutely LOVE this place!  So many fun and unique items.  Great place to buy some pretty awesome gifts or treat yourself to something nice!
