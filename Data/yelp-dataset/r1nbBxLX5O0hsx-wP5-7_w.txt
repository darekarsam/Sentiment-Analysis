5	Ogborne Law, PLC provides excellent legal services at a reasonable price and with service that is simply not found at most law firms. If you have a legal issue I would highly recommend that you give Michelle a call!
5	I have had the pleasure of knowing Michelle for a few months and I love that I've found someone with integrity and purpose to their practice.  It really shows through her community outreach and clear communication.  She has a vision to make a difference and that becomes clearer to me every time I meet her.  I can't recommend her enough!
5	Michelle is the most caring, intelligent, awesome lawyer along with Marjorie. They are super caring and super intuitive and will address all aspects of your needs with compassion, intellect and even humor(unusual for lawyers!) They can help you in all aspects of family law!!!
