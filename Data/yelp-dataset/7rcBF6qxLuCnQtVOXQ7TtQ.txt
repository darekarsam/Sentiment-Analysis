5	These guys are the best. Very knowledgable about wheels and tires. Great selection and inventory. Always friendly and professional. Highly recommend to anyone that needs a small fix or a complete set of wheels.
5	I've been coming to the same tire shop ever since I was a kid riding in the backseat with Mom.  Same owners too...crazy!We used to go there years ago because my mom was on a budget and needed fair prices on used tires.  Fit the bill!Now that I am grown, I have special needs for my custom wheels and tires, including stretching tires on 20s and not wanting scratches or damage to the wheel lips! Happy to say, Crown delivers on fair prices, brand new top of the line tire and wheel equipment, knowledge of mounting custom wheels and tires, stretching tires, and knowing English!!   HahahaaaNeighborhood sucks, and the place is a little intimidating to someone not from "the hood", but give them a try, especially if you are rolling on $3000+ wheels!  They are the only ones I trust with my wheels!
5	I won't go ANYWHERE else for my tires!! I trust these professional with my life and 7 kids lives. They keep my wheels rolling safe. It has been in business since I was little even with the same owners. They know cars and tires like no other place in town. Crown is super fast, efficient, hardworking and honest. I highly recommend them. If I could give 10 stars I would.
5	Wow! This place was great! They fixed a puncture in my tire in less than a half hour for only $10! I'll never go anywhere else! Thanks!
