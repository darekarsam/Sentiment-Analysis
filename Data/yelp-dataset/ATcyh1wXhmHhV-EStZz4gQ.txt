5	I found Lauren from groupon, I opt for the highlights, gloss (which she suggested), and haircut. As a mother of two and full time working I needed a haircut that's wash and wear but still pretty! And she did exactly what I had pictured in mind! Layered and highlighted - very nicely done! She is very detail oriented and professional! I am so pleased with her work that I bought my mom a package as a gift. I highly recommend her and will definitely be back (maybe I'll dare to do lighter highlights next time). Thanks Lauren!
1	If I could give zero stars, I would!  Went to Lauren Coulter for a color package purchased thru Groupon and, oh no, never again.  She  FRIED my hair!  Tried to get back in to see if there was something that could be done and she was "unavailable".  Waited two weeks for an appointment and waited nearly 30 minutes before I gave up and left.  Horrible experience!
4	Lauren's office is neat and quaint, it's so great to get my hair done where there is privacy from loud blow driers and chatter without the chemical smell that a large one room salon has. I am glad I found her. She was attentive and demonstrated professionalism and skill in her trade. I found her on my own while searching for more close to home service providers. Being closer to me and the great service will keep me building a relationship with Lauren.
