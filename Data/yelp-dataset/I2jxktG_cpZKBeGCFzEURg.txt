5	I absolutely enjoy going to Dr. Rudavsky.  He's such a wonderful mix of old school, no nonsense optometrist, with lots of interesting high tech gadgets.  He writes down his notes with a fountain pen.  His office reminds me of a pediatrician's office for kids.  All of this, I really love.  Add to the mix his warm and genial manner, and his vast knowledge... he's the real deal.  I hope he never retires.
5	Dr. Rudavsky is great - very intelligent, practical, thorough, and efficient.  He will not rush you and seems like a nice guy.  His staff is nice and professional as well.  He will take his time to get your prescription right (he does it himself, not his staff), and if you want contacts he will give you samples to try until you really find something you like.  Unlike most other optometrist's offices, I don't feel like Dr. Rudavsky is in some money-making scheme or is just trying to see as many patients as possible without any regard to the quality of care he is providing.  The 20/20 optics center is next door so I got my glasses there right after my appointment - super convenient.  Barry is nice to work with, probably a bit more helpful than Charles.  The inventory (frames) seem to be updated with some frequency so if you don't fall in love with anything right away, come back in a week.
5	Dr. Rudavsky is my fourth eye doctor since moving to Pittsburgh. My appointment started exactly on time and my exam was very thorough. Dr. Rudavsky is very friendly and the office has a very comfortable feel. Dr. Rudavsky does not push any particular glasses because he is financially independent of the opticians next door. I cannot recommend Dr. Rudavsky highly enough.
