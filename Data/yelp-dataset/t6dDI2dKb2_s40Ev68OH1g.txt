4	If Mexico were to pick up and move to West Phoenix, it would reside in Ranch Market.  The closest thing I can compare it to is the Mexico exhibition at Epcot Center.  It is large, colorful, has occasional mariachis and folklorico dancers...babies, Mexicanas shopping in full makeup and high heels and men with big mustachios...oh, and food, glorious food.This place is phenom.  It has a beautiful panaderia, (albeit the pan dulces are a bit on the hard side-I don't eat them from here...go to La Purisima in Glendale), a carniceria, cremeria, fruteria...you get it.  Ranch Market is like a proper mercado in Mexico.  They also have a "cafeteria" where you can get menudo on Sundays (don't miss it), and all kinds of tacos, tamales, enchiladas, burritos, carne asada, etc. any other time of day.  Their $2 breakfast burrito is enough to make anyone stop buying breakfast groceries.I live in Florida and absolutely LOVE going home to Phoenix and coming here everyday.  The produce is always really nice and fresh, and CHEAP!!  I've heard they only buy from farms in Mexico. So, although you might need a passport and a translator to shop here, I swear to GOD it is worth it.
4	I have shopped here many times to get a few things. I really like the juice bar everything is fresh and so delicious. I sampled every single fruit water and the horchata. Each and every one was refreshing and tasty. I get the fresh tortillas still nice and warm. I still need to try the eateries inside. Maybe when I have time. This place is not as packed as it was when it first opened. I still remember when it was abco many years ago. My husband said it used to be an alpha beta before that. Wow.
5	I love there teleras and pan dulce. Always a huge selection for everything you need. I always go here when I'm on vacation in AZ, to pick up handmade tortillas and bread for my menudo. Friendly staff, but super busy!! This place is always packed!!!
