5	I've been using R and C Pest Control for over 2 years now and their service is top notch!  KC has been spraying outside my house once a month and it is rare to see any bugs on my property.  I had ants that were getting into my upstairs bathroom by climbing up a neighbors tree that hung over my roof.  When I told KC, he was able to spray the base of my neighbors tree and the ants haven't been seen since.  If you have any insect issues do not hesitate to call R and C.  They are professional, friendly, inexpensive, and most importantly effective!
5	We have been using R & C since moving back to the LV area in March 2014. Our service person is K.C. Wade. We could not ask for a more reliable or courteous gentleman.  He is the best.
5	We have been using R & C Pest Control for a long time and I would not consider using any other pest control company.  They are efficient, reliable and very considerate of our needs. If you want the best in town, call R & C! They're always on time and I have never had any issues with them. I recommend them every chance I get.
5	I have been using R and C pest control for many years now and the service that they give  is  like none other.  My technician is KC Wade and he always calls the night before to let me know he is coming.  He always has a smile on his face and does an outstanding job.  I have recommended this company to many of my neighbors and friends.  You will not be disappointed by using R and C Pest Control!!!
5	We have nothing but good things about R & C pest, KC is the best ! He always asks if we have any problems ( bugs ) when he sprays, would highly recommend !
