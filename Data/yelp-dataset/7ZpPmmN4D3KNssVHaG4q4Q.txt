4	It's been many years since I've been to a circus.  Last night I had the opportunity to check out Circus Vargas - Magikaria.  The tent for this show was relatively small, so I knew there wouldn't be any animals featured in the show.The show had a combination of Magic and Acrobats along with some traditional Circus acts (Ball of Death, Trapeze).  I don't want to give away the details of the show, so I won't write about it.  All I can say was that it exceeded my expectations.  The family and I had a good time.  If you have kids that are under 13 yrs old, they'll love it.  Heck, even my 17 yr old Son enjoyed it, so I guess it appeals to all ages.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/magikaria-circus-vargas-scottsdale?select=aq3YZVPHp_0151zFrfURTg#aq3YZVPHp_0151zFrfURTghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/magikaria-circus-vargas-scottsdale?select=X1dAwPRsGDTMCNW659Nv0A#X1dAwPRsGDTMCNW659Nv0Ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/magikaria-circus-vargas-scottsdale?select=slG174i7LQNWKeXFjeNmfg#slG174i7LQNWKeXFjeNmfgThe show is 2 hrs long which includes a 20-25 min intermission.

1	Circus Vargas$$$$ Please be aware and let family and friends be aware for wherever this circus travels.... I was just notified from my bank of fraudulent activity. It was traced back from the circus from when they were here in Scottsdale. When my husband purchased popcorn and drinks, the 'kid' who took the debit/credit card  also took the card info. I would not post this if I did not know for sure. There procedure for credit/debit cards is shady. They tried to use card at many gas stations , etc. If you saw the show in AZ go check your bank statements. If you know of anyone going to the show in any city that circus will be traveling to....make sure they pay in cash for everything they purchase!
5	We attended the circus performance at Superstition Springs Mall in Mesa 2014. The only other circus we have attended in the Ringling Brothers & Barnum & Bailey Circus. Circus Vargas is not on the same level of RBBBC but it is just as professional. This is a family run business. We attended on a day when there was only about 50 persons in attendance. Mostly families. More seats than people but the performance was just as good for one and a half hours. The acts were from Latin and Central America and performed very well. They try very hard getting the audience involved. The whole show is fun. The place, tent,  and restroom facilities  are set up well for those who may have disabilities and/or handicapped.The blue tent is clearly seen from afar. The only distraction was that from the outside the tent was a bit dusty but that is understandable since we are in the desert. Also, the bleachers look very uncomfortable and are placed at the rear of the circular tent arena. The most expensive seats around the circle are the most comfortable. No animals. Just excellent human talent and skill. Get a ticket and go! If you have doubts leave them and go with your best intentions - they will be met.
