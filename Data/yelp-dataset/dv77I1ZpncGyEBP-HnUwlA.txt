3	This is just your average CVS.  If you are looking for a spectacularly above-average customer service experience you are not going to find it as the only associates are manning the registers.  I came in looking for some Mucinex thanks to the onset of allergy season.  Thankfully, since this is a chain store, the layout is almost exactly they same as every other CVS and I knew where to go.
3	I guess it would be unfair to say that EVERYONE who works here is just not nice... But I think its pretty accurate.  I have encountered the occasional friendly face ( usually at check out.. But not always) but for the most part, its just a bland, semi-unpleasant experience. Sure they have everything you would expect of a drugstore but if you're looking for a place that actually does customer service, keep driving. There's a Walgreen's right next store.
5	I'm always in here grabbing a snack on my way to work on a weekly basis and everyone who works here is very friendly - always asking if they can help with anything and just making polite conversation at the checkout. Very helpful associates.
