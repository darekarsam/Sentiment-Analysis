5	These guys have been around forever, they care about the long-term relationship.  My first experience with Qualtire was almost 30 years ago (They have been at the same location since the 1960's)  when my father needed some sewer line work.  It was going to be expensive, but they worked with him to make it affordable by showing him exactly where to dig so he could to the digging himself.  Once the digging was done they came back and did the plumbing part. That saved my Dad a lot of money. Whenever I need plumbing thy are the only people I call.
