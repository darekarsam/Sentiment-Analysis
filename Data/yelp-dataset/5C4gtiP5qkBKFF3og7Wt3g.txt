3	I've never eaten anything but ice cream at Dairy Queen, but recently I was encouraged by a coworker to give it a try.  This Dairy Queen gets pretty busy, but I was served within five minutes.  The shrimp is actually really good; not too fried-tasting.  The fries are as good as any competitor's, and the sauces here are not bad!  However, what really blew me away was the blizzard.  Mm!  How can you go wrong with an Oreo Blizzard from Dairy Queen?  I got the biggest one, and it was definitely too much for me to finish.  Service here was courteous though not exactly friendly.  Their selection of ice cream cakes was ample and tasty looking!
5	Always been good!  Had a choc ice cream double dipped in cherry!
4	The chocolate covered strawberry bowl was very good. However when you ask what is in the different blizzards, no one seems to know and they have to go get a list. They did find out for me however and were pleasant about it. Always very good, prices similar to other places.
3	friendly and fast! but they are in need of a remodel.
3	I love Dairy Queen and especially their chicken strips and fries. I get this almost every time I come, and am never disappointed. My one complaint is that every time I do, regardless of I just waited behind other customers in the drive thru, I am asked to drive to the front and wait for my food. Tonight I sat for a good 10 minutes and when I pulled up, I paid and immediately asked to pull to the front. The good thing is I know my food is fresh, but what bothers me is in that 10 minutes I waited behind two customers, my order hadn't even been started? I waited in the parking lot an additional 11 minutes before someone brought me my one order of chicken strips. Hopefully they improve this.
