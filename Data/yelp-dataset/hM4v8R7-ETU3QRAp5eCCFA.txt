3	So it's OK and they deliver which is the best reason to order. But I find it expensive for what you get.
4	In terms of authentic thai food in Montreal coming from someone who has spent a significant amount of time in Thailand, I would have to say this tops the list.Tom Kha - delicious, might need to mention youd like it spicy if thats what you look forGreen Curry - not the most authentic one ive seen to date, but for Montreal, its as good as youll get
3	I really like this Thai restaurant.....it is close to my house and we have been loyal customers since their opening.  The owner knows us by name all of us, including the four kids! These little details make a difference! They have now moved to a larger location....hoping it will be good for them and that the quality of their food will remain the same excellent thai food that we love....all the best for the future Basilic Vert.
