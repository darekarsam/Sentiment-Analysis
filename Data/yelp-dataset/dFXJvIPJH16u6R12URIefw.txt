1	Never coming back here. Service was terrible - took 45 minutes to get our first drinks. No one offered us menus. Food took forever. We ordered a round of premium vodka shots and it was clear to us they gave us a cheaper brand but charged us for the top shelf stuff. Had to point it out to get the bill adjusted. Spent $130/ couple and left hungry. This place is new so perhaps they will iron out some of these issues but we left feeling taken and will never return.
1	Just placed our order - I won't even wait for the food to say how terrible the service is.If you are a douche (tasteless or not), you will be right at home!
5	loved it, the experience was amazing, the food was top, simply the chef is amazing cook and the service was really good. Would go back for sure!
