4	Conveniently located near the Strip, the Drive-Thru window with saturday hours, and located near my job, easily makes this one my go-to credit union (out of the four locations around the valley). The wait for the drive-thru window is not very long (maybe two or three cars at most), as some members prefer to walk in- but then again, I usually go on a weekday during my lunch break. The tellers are very nice.
5	Just opened account, received wonderful service and so far so good.  The checking account had no fees and includes rewards as well.  Impressive that checks and debit cards can all be made on-site.
2	The locations are limited. So far so good and unable to create an online profile. I do NOT like having to call to set anything up. It's frustrating for those who work.
1	You have to go to shady areas of town to make deposits, unless you want to drive clear across town, and god forbid if the "Third party leased ATM" machine breaks down... while making a $1000+ deposit.The answer to the problem?"You have to wait till the company who owns the ATM makes their weekly rounds and then we will deposit the funds into your account."Going on day four now. Must be nice to live in a world where rent and bills dont have to be paid on time and where late fees dont exist. A phone call to the company that actually owns the machine couldnt be made. Too much trouble.Dont waste your time with this bank. Youre better off with Bank of America if that gives you somewhat of an idea of what youre dealing with at WestStar Credit Union.
