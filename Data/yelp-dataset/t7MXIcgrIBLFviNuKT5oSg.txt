5	Very fresh pastries , their food is amazing, friendly stuff, fast service , I highly recommend it
4	This was my first time at this place but I was looking for a good pastry shop in the area and this hits the mark. Yes they do the traditional cheesecakes but do so much more with the ethnic desserts. The puddings and cheese filled pastries were out of this world. The owner was very friendly and explained the ingredients. I will be back to try more.
5	Lot to choose from and for this person likeable flavors new to the pallet. Zatar/cheese on flatbread.cheese/fresh spinach on flatbread Soujok which is beef, garlic, chili peper and spices on flatbread with a true gift for your sensory perseption. I enjoyed Kenafa Nubalsi desert at two other restaurants. This place to me was SUPERIOR Kenafa  Also had nice tea with mint and pleasant bottle nixed fruit drink. Would kile to try everything but blindfold suggested in area of pastry case. Fortunately I put all my weight on in my ears!
4	This is flatbread (Afghan style) central my friends. If its not here, it does not exist. Real good flatbread styles from the other side of the world. Oh and the deserts are real good too, take them to go. In goodness they have tea and such on the house, as is custom. Moustafa runs a good operation here, along with the ladies kept in back. As custom too, lots of smoking and chatting outside, no need to rush off.
