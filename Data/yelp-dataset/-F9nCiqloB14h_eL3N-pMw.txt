5	I love my office space. The staff is Awesome and always ready to help. I also like the fact the office is located right next to the 95 on ramp, so I can get in and out quickly.
5	The two receptionists Kirsa and Joyce are very professional and willing to help when asked. They answer the phones professionally and always upbeat. These spaces are a good option for business incubation or other businesses types. Eric the manager is proactive and answers any questions that come up with precise efficiency.  All in all a good place to run business. Try and get all incedentials included if possible prior to lease execution.
5	I've used these services for the past few years. The team at Intelligent Office has been excellent to work with.  A few times a critical situation has arisen with a customer of mine while I was unreachable.  Each time the IO Staff has gone above and beyond to ensure my customer's satisfaction. That's a spirit of service that I rarely see and always appreciate.
