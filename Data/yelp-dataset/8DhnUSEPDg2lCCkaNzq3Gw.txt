4	A few workers there are pretty freakin cool. They help ya with the menu and suggest items without hesitation. Food is pretty good, its just small portions (for America). Im sure ill come back and get some yummy sandwiches.
4	My first time having lunch at an Einstein Bagel. The food (sandwich and soup) was very tasty. The service was quick and the price was right.
1	Horrible service.  And when the only requirement for most orders is applying cream cheese to bagel, not excusable.  Don't go here on a weekday if you don't want to be late for work.  Frozen, then baked bagels ok except for cornmeal on the bottom of everything.
2	I've tried the breakfast sandwiches a couple of times and wasn't too impressed either time.  Seems like glorified fast food and I would much rather have McDonalds since I get what I expect for a more reasonable price.
1	Got an hour? That's about how long it will take you to get a bagel from here on the weekend. At 9 am on Sunday the line wrapped all the way across the front of the store, all the away along the next wall and out the front door and into the parking lot. You could bake your own bagels in the time it takes to get them from here. After watching the line not move for ten minutes I just left. According to my calculation I would have had to wait an hour to get served
