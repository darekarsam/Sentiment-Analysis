5	After going to AKA several more times, I have to say that this place is worth 5 stars. They serve consistently good and fresh-tasting sushi.  Its closed on Sundays.
2	Been here twice and 1st time I order a la carte and it was ok tasting and quality. Second time I went, we ordered the all you can eat menu and literally, we pretty much ate rice. Really tiny pieces of fish you could barely find with all the cucumber and other fillers and the RICE, OMG, so MUCH RICE. anyways, not worth $20 a person.
