4	The Boat House has 3 sections: upstairs is a cocktail bar, and downstairs is The Restaurant and The Bistro (emphasis on the capital letters). I ate at The Bistro which has a more changing menu (so it seems - it was new and apparently quite different from the recent visit of my dining companions) and is more casual than The Restaurant.  It also isn't quite so strictly seafood.That being said, everyone in our small party (4) had seafood.  I enjoyed some delicious and well-prepared scallops after having a really tasty starter of fried brie and jam.  My mind is drawing a complete blank as to what I had for dessert, but I do recall that I liked it! The hot chocolate was smooth and delicious as well.The Boat House is on my list for repeat visits. I enjoyed my dinner there and the waitstaff were quite welcoming! I'm marking the price range as "spendy" as I had both a starter and a dessert, but you can certainly eat there for less!
4	I came here on one of my first trips to Edinburgh. Apart from being set in the very pretty South Queensferry, the Boat house has the advantage of a great view of the Bridges.  I ate at the bistro section and I really enjoyed my food (scallops) and the waitress was lovely and even though we hadn't booked a table (we were 4 people) managed to squeeze us close to the window. Prices are a little above average, although this always depends on your budget.
4	Very nice, seafood bistro overlooking the firth with great views of both bridges.You also have non fish options on the menu, but it is predominantly seafood.Good menu choices & staff friendly. Would come back again.
