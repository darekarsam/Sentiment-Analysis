4	I never went inside the restaurant, so I cannot comment on how their service is. The restaurant itself seems nice and quiet, with very few customers.I usually order a portion of Beef Tacos for takeout, and oh my goodness they're amazing. The ground beef were well seasoned, the handmade tacos were soft and tasty, fragrantly dressed with onions and cilantro, and the chilli sauce that comes with it gives a kick to the pallet that just unifies everything together.Love it, will try other dishes next time.
3	from the kids to the parents to the grandparents to the aunts and uncles, this is a small family run restaurant that offers latin american fare. you'll find the classics you'd expect from latin america from tacos to empanadas to churros.this is not your spanish churros which are thinner, crispier, tossed in sugar and dipped in chocolate. these churros are the mexican variety: bigger, not as crispy, tossed in cinnamon sugar and filled with either chocolate or dulce de leche. they are made to order which guarantees you a fresh batchas i have only tried the churros, i can't really judge the quality of the rest of their menu (which is extremely hard to find except the empanadas counter) so this is all about that one item.these inexpensive treats are good hot. turn to crap when cold or the next day though. reheating don't do them justicein the end, good little place for the neighborhoodps. i have no idea about their opening hours except that they are definitely closed on sunday and tend to close early the rest of the week
