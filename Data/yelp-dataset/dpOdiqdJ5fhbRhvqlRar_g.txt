5	Great local business.  The space is warm, open and inviting and the owner has a real dedication to health and wellbeing.  The juice bar was fresh and really great combinations of fruit and veg.  I'd love to come back for a yoga class someday.
5	By far on of the most addicting place in the city to stop for a pick me up.  Love their assortment of different organic juices, and also the extra add ons.  They will even make you juices in bottles, so you can wake up the next day and have your fix.  I truly love that they opened this place around town.  It even got my husband into wheatgrass!
4	I've been to the Embody in the North Hills and enjoyed the yoga session there, so I was excited to come here for a workshop on body language put together by Propelle.  I didn't try the juice at the NH shop, but I did try it here.  It was delicious!  I got the ABCD (Apples, Bananas, Carrots, Dates) and enjoyed the fresh veggies and fruits blended together along with a few pieces of dates that didn't fully blend in, which gave you something to chew - very nice.My only complaint is that the smoothies were more on the side of juice (I'm used to a lot of body with my smoothies) and slightly pricey, but the owner is friendly and pleasant, even though she had a long line of ladies wanting smoothies and juices.  I love the natural feel of the space and would enjoy coming back for a class very soon.
4	Very friendly staff, beautiful space and a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  Wish they offered more early morning and evening yoga classes.  A little expensive but like everything you get what you pay for.  Love this little spot in Lville.
5	By far the best juice bar in Pittsburgh.
