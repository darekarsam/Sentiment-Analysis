1	If there was a negative star I would give it. Stay away from this place! They are only trying to make the most money possible from you. Save your money and go to a locally owned shop that won't try to rip you off!
4	Friendly service. Dave was very knowledgeable and not only offered advise but actually showed me what was wrong with the car. Definitely recommend
