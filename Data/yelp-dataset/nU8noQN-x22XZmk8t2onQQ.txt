5	Michael Barnes and his associates are an amazing company to do business with.  I was buying a house off of a short sale and they did prompt and quick work with my mortgage.  I received the best interest rate by far and he made my first house buying an experience stress free and enjoyable! I never felt along and he was always here explaining the next step. I would highly recommend, and have referred friends, to use Michael for future home buying experiences.  Thank you again!
5	I am thankful every day for you and your team Michael Barnes!  You guys are awesome and I will recommend you to anyone that will listen!  :)
5	I would not be in the house I am in today if it wasn't for Michael and the rest of Velocity Financial. It was my first home buying experience and Velocity Financial made it a comfortable experience for me and gave me the reassurance that they would get the job done. Michael kept me updated along the whole process, telling me every option we had and direction we could take. They treated me like one of their family members with how hard they were working to make sure I got the best interest rate and keeping my monthly payment where I felt comfortable. I would recommend Michael and his amazing staff at Velocity Financial to anyone looking for a loan. I will be back here again for my next home purchase.
5	Great job getting our second home financing in place...Spencer and team are diligent, honest and very easy to work with...
