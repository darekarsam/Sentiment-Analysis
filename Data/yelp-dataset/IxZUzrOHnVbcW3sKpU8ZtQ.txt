3	A fair option for ordinary, North American-style Chinese in the shadow of Concordia University's downtown sprawl. "Spicy" dishes really aren't (and I had asked for mine extra-spicy), and the seasonings don't really have any level of particular complexity. Disappointing because I was expecting more based on the raves of a colleague; ultimately this is really on a par with food court Chinese, albeit served in a nicer setting and with very amiable, pleasant staff.
3	I went to Kam Ho with a fairly large group of people (20+) and the service was fast, the waiters friendly. The food was alright; I ordered a General Tao Tofu. It wasn't the best I've had in Montreal but it wasn't the worst either. I would not mind goind back but it wouldn't be my first choice.
3	I really just go here for their awesome egg tofu and eggplant hotpot. It's huge (I always order with a takeaway container for the inevitable 50% leftovers). When it's one of those blustery, vile, -20 Montreal winter days, it is the thing to order. Saucy, melt-in-your-mouth eggplant and tons of sliced onions come with lightly fried soft egg tofu (and what appears to be some small bits of chicken). Watch it! It's scalding hot when it hits the table, so don't just dive in like a crazy person. It's the kind of meal that will stick to your ribs and make you ready to face the elements with new resolve.
2	The food is mediocre at best. I went there for dinner and ordered some rice with chicken and a bowl of soup. The soup tasted like plain water with some stuff in it. Although the portion was quite large, it was not tasty at all. When I arrived at the restaurant, two servers were talking with each other and completely ignored me. They eventually came up to me to ask for my order once they finished talking. What kind of restaurant ignored their customers when they first enter the restaurant?
