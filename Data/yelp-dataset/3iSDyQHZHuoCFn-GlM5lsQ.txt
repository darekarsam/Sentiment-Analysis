Drive, bus, bike, walk, run, hop, jump, skip, I don't care, this is THE place to have your standard Quebec quality poutine (and I emphasize STANDARD, as in without all the additional stuff you usually add at La Banquise).I visited here a few days ago after a tip from my friend, who is 99% never wrong when it comes to good food, especially in Montreal. Sure enough, this time was part of the 99%. I ordered a standard small poutine with a drink, and the poutine, despite the small size, is gigantic. I finished maybe about 60-70% of it, and even my friend who has a huge appetite, only barely finished the whole thing. I can't imagine anyone finishing a large unless they're sharing.As for the poutine, it's everything that it should be. LOTS of cheese curds (as in you can't see the fries), gravy that's actually tasty, and fries that are picked perfectly and fried fresh. The best part about all this is that the waiting time for a poutine to finish is only about 2 minutes, yet you can really feel like all the ingredients are fresh. I honestly don't know how they do it.Now, despite all the gloating, you wonder why I didn't give it 5 stars? The pricing mechanism. The poutine is priced fairly at around $6, with hot dogs being a cheap 79 cents, however they earn back your money by inflating the cost of drinks. A can of pop cost $2.19 not including tax, which is more than the $1-1.50 price I'm used to. If anything don't bother purchasing drinks until after you finish your poutine, where there's a McDonald's a stones throw away.With that aside, what are you waiting for? Go! I know I will in my next visit to Montreal!
