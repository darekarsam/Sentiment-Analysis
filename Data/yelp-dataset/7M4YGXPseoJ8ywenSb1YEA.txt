4	As far as urgent care goes, this one was pretty good.  All three people I encountered were very friendly, which tends to be an issue in urgent care centers (rushed triage nurses mean brisk attitudes).  I was seen very quickly, which could be due either to the time of day (about 3pm... there weren't a lot of people waiting) or the nature of my complaint.  Either way, I was out the door with advice in hand after about a half hour.  Obviously I hope I don't ever visit them again, but if I had to, I'll choose this center.
1	A business built on lies. I showed up at 7:10p on a Friday. The sign outside of the building said they were open until 8p. Their website said they were open until 7:30p. However, the door was locked. All lights and TV were on. So I knocked on the door. As I was knocking, a woman peaked out of one of the windows.  When I saw her, she quickly ducked down. I proceeded to knock. Some guy eventually came to the door. He didn't even unlock it and yelled at me through the glass they were closed. I questioned him on it.  He replied "read the hours on the door." The door only had the time they opened. I referenced the sign outside and the website. According to both, they should have still been open. He stamped and lied saying the hours had changed. Probably a blessing in disguise, since they went to such great lengths to avoid my business (hiding & lying), I can only imagine the low quality of care.
