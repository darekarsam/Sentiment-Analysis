2	I was hungry and I needed to pee.  What can I say?  The bathroom doors are locked and the associates have to buzz you in.  You would think they would be clean -- not so much.  I was able to get myself a two-cheeseburger meal to sate my hunger.  Oof...it was another bathroom run soon after.
3	The environment is a lot nicer than it was previously...no complaints other than the fruit flies around the open ketchup dispenser...tht was kinda nasty...This McDonald's has a very nice updated decor. I like how the furniture and the tables appear to come from IKEA.  They now have Bar style seating with large red cushions that are smooth and made of some kind of leather like material. The wall tiles are very large giving the dining area a feeling of openness. My favorite thing about this McDonald's is that the menu is on large LCD TV screens as opposed to a chart. The picture quality is really clear and bright and the options are easy to read as opposed to before when they were dimly lit. The parking lot is a lot more open too giving you a chance to maneuver around cars that are backing out or waiting in the drive through line. This McDonald's is definitely an upgrade from the one that was there before. it's no longer on a sharp hill but everything around the restaurant is generally flat so that makes for a nice smooth trip going through the drive-through.
