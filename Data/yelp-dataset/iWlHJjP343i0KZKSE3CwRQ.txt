5	Definitely the best recording studio in Phoenix area, you will enjoy your time there and Mikey B is THE MAN, and brings out the best in everyone playing.
1	It's been years since my band and I recorded here, but I couldn't forget the experience if I tried. Aside from the crude child rape joke that made me want to knock the hell out of our producer, the work in general was very lazy. I wouldn't record at Full Well if the time was free.
5	Best recording experience ever.   The engineer was fantastic.   The sound was world class.   Great vibes.   Highly recommend
5	Full Well is the BEST recording studio in Phoenix, bar none.  Mike has a terrific attitude and is incredibly skilled at what he does.  Full Well has an amazing array of AWESOME gear (vintage and new) and Mike uses it to squeeze every last drop of delicious sonic goodness from everyone he works with.Mike recording space is clean, comfortable, and inviting.  Whenever I'm there, I find it difficult NOT to feel inspired!Mike is dedicated, passionate, and just a fun guy to work with.  Use Full Well Recording Studio for your next project and let Mike infect you with his love of music and passion for recording excellence.
5	I have happily known Mike for 20 years...there is a reason for the wait and his customer list is a credit to that fact. I always have several customers who are always in line to go to Full Well...Keep up the good work Mike!
