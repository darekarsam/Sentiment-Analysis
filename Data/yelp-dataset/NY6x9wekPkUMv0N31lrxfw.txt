5	Chelsea is a stylist who understands haircuts for men, and is regularly flown throughout the US to lecture on men's hair to other stylists. At a price of $25, you are getting a steal to have Chelsea.
4	Chelci has been doing my hair for 3 years. She is very talented and creates great color and cuts! She listens to what you want and will offer feedback. She's done beautiful updo's for my daughter's school dances.
5	Chelci has been cutting my hair for ages, she is professional and gets the job done! I would recommend her to anyone!
5	Chelci does the BEST hair and color!  She's an artist, not just trained to cut hair but has an artistic eye for knowing how to shape hair.  I'm a female with short hair and it can get screwed up 9 out of 10 times by other hair stylists, but never with Chelci.
