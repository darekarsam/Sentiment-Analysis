3	The view and the service was very good, this restaurant is located at the top of the Delta hotel and seems to be quite popular. The food was decent but some of the cold cuts could have been fresher and for the price of the brunch (about $35 per person..ouch!) I felt that it left a lot to be desired.  I've been fortunate enough to pay for brunch at the Hotel Del Coronado and I know I'm not getting a bad deal but here aside from the view and the rotating restaurant I didn't feel justified the price, oh well.
3	Very good French onion soup. Good service. A little high priced for quality though
