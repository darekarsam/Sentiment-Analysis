1	Gas prices generally a lot higher then other nearby stations and an someone always parks in front of the air filling station. Likely this is on purpose.
1	This place frequently gets robbed and you order from a window at night.There's a CoGo's 2 minutes away on Beechwood/Greenfield Ave. I'll go the extra distance.
3	Typically a nickel to seven cents cheaper than the national average and a better than average store. Always congested and on a very busy corner, but worth the stop just in gas savings.
