5	I have never spray tanned before & I was referred to Vanity Glo by a friend. I was hosting a party & needed some coloring so I thought Id give it a try & they were sweet enough to squeeze me on short notice; gotta love that! 1st let me say I loved the spa; its cute & got a shabby chic feel to it. I was greeted by 2 smiling girls named Tatum & Catherine. Tatum went over the procedure & what to do & what to NOT do (I was fearful of looking like Chester the cheetah;) She was super nice & I she made me feel completly comfortable & by the time I knew it ... I was glo'N! #smiles =)  & i could tell right away; I love that part; its INSTANT! it was even & no streaks & no signs of Chester LOL I have since been back & gotten to meet sweet sweet Zoe; super friendly & professional & I always leave feeling AMAZING with this awesome tan. I like it so much that I have referred my mother & aunt who are going this week. So excited to have this in Charlotte & in my neighborhood at that! Def will tell my friends about it. I also want to try out some of the spa accomidations. I cant wait to go back - i should probably call & make an apt with Zoe now! she ROX! go get ya glo ON!
5	Great place! Excellent friendly staff....my tan lasted for days! I Highly recommend this place
5	These girls are complete miracle workers. I can't get over how good I looked at my girlfriends wedding a few weeks ago... The pictures just got in and they are absolutely *FLAWLESS* it's amazing what a lil color can do for your confidence.  I would highly recommend Zoe & Tatum to any and all, who love lookin good! Can't wait to get my Glo on again, real soon. Thanks again Ladies!
5	Beautiful colour. Incredibly accommodating.  I'd never spray tanned in CLT before, a friend recommended VanityGlo.  My first tan was lovely, natural & perfectly priced.  Lasted about 6 days. Next time I needed some spray-on colour was right before an unexpected trip to Miami (literally 2 days notice). I work the late night news, so my schedule isn't exactly spray-tan friendly...but after a full month of rain in CLT, I was definitely NOT tan enough for MIA.  I called Zoe...& she ha no issue coming in to spray me after midnight the day I was leaving!! I made it MIA bronzed & beautiful.... Zoe & company are the only people in CLT I will put my trust in for my spray tan. It's good enough to show off on the beach & on the news. Don't bother going anywhere else.  #enoughsaid.
4	Got a great tan before heading to Texas, when I got there everyone was talking about tanning beds and wondering how I got such a great Tan.  I highly recommend!!!!!
5	Was in Charlotte from Phoenix and found Vanity Glo.  Zoe was fantastic.  She accommodated my schedule and gave me a beautiful tan.  Great color and even.  The spa was conveniently located.  I will definitely go back to see her when I'm in Charlotte again!  Thanks Zoe!
