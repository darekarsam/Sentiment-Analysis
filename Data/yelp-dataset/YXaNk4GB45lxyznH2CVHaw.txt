3	I've been a member of Edinburgh Leisure for over a year now and this is still the only facilities I've chosen to avail myself of. As one of the larger leisure centres in Edinburgh it has everything I'm looking for from a gym. A pool, a gym with ample equipment and a schedule of exercise classes I can fit around my routines. The centre is just the right distance from my work that I can pop in for a quick 5k on my lunch break and as the gym is never busy at lunch time I always know I'll get a machine without having to wait. The classes can sometimes be a bit hard to get a place on, especially the more popular ones such as body pump and body attack. The best way to guarantee a place is to book a full 8 days in advance otherwise you'll have to go on a waiting list for a spot. Edinburgh Leisure have just started to crack down on people not showing up for class bookings. This is both good and bad. It's good because it means it should (in theory) be easier to book a space for classes. However its bad because at Drumbrae they hardly ever answer the phone, so good luck actually getting through to someone to cancel your booking! Its a real bug bear of mine to see staff having conversations when there are customers waiting to be served or the phone is ringing. I'm not saying it happens all the time, but this does happen at Drumbrae and it gets right on my wick. The good thing is that, like me, you can always channel your anger in to running harder and faster during your work out.
