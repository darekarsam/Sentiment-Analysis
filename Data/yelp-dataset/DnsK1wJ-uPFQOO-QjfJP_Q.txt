1	What an excellent example of bottom-tier medicine. It sounds like a bargain until you're in the door. Then they've got you. I truly feel for the folks who feel they must utilize these so-called clinics.I went to the take care clinic because I was feeling really lousy. My doctor (now ex-doc) didn't have any appointments for a week and since I'd already felt awful for a couple of days I decided, on the suggestion of someone I knew, to try this clinic.The wait was 45 minutes, even though I was the only one waiting. Once I got in the door I got a cursory examination from a nurse (might have been a nurse practitioner, I don't know). She gave me four prescriptions - antibiotics, nasal spray, two other pills - which she sent to the pharmacy conveniently located just outside her door. Out-of-pocket to the clinic, $25. Out-of-pocket at the pharmacy, $100. Ouch! I felt sicker than when I went in.A week later, still sick as a dog, I got in to see a new doctor (I'd given up on my old one for a number of reasons). It turns out that what I had was viral so the antibiotics were unnecessary. Of the three other meds she prescribed, all were unnecessary but one probably made me more comfortable.So, all told, I was out of pocket $150 (when you include my doctor visit) and $125 was a waste of money. In my opinion it's quite a racket Walgreens has going - practitioners on-site to over-prescribe medications that they will happily fill. Avoid them if you can.
