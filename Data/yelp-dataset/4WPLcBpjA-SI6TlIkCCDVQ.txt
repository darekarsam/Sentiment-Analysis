5	Great church with loving people!  If you're in the area and you want to grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ you definitely need to stop in!
5	Truly a spirit led church.  This church teaches verse by verse from the bible without wavering.  The Pastor teaches with conviction and encourages the congregation to get into the word themselves, not to just take his word for it.  The congregation itself is loving and welcoming and goes out of their way to say hello and share the love of Christ.  Highly recommend stoping in if you are looking for a bible believe, bible teaching, home church!
