5	You can now get your sushi fix at Carolina Place Mall's food court!I am so glad that Wasabi Sushi took over the former Time Warner Cable and customer service Center behind the elevator.  If I can't exchange out my DVR box, at least I can get some fresh tasting sushi!  WS offers a full menu in a quick stop space.  Grab your sushi and head to the tables in the main food court or take it home like I did during my first visit.  My tempura shrimp roll was fresh from the wok and still warm when I bit into it.  I found my new go at the mall when hunger strikes.
5	Actually, it was my third time. This place IS too good for mall. Good, FRESH, hot or cool sushi!! A MUST for a quick take-out sushi!
5	I was craving sushi and decided to give this place a try. I was very impressed by the quality and taste. The ingredients seemed fresh and everything tasted amazing... I would definitely come back the next time I'm at the mall. The staff was also very courteous and I got my food right away.
5	Okay this is first rate sushi! I love it! Sad but sometimes I find an excuse to go to the mall just so I can get the crunchy shrimp roll! Made to order! Quality is excellent and staff could not be any nicer!!
5	Okay I cannot Believe this place is located in the middle of the mall!!!!! OMG this sushi is Amazing!!!
5	Once you get past the fact that you're eating sushi in a mall, oh my gosh!! Amazingly fresh sushi! I was very pleasantly surprised and have been here several times. I've had the spicy tuna, crunchy shrimp rolls and a couple others that I can't remember their names (all good and so fresh)...Anyway, give it a try, it's DELISH!
