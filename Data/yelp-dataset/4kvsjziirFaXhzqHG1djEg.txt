5	Tracy is amazing! She took me from almost black, to almost platinum blonde in 2 visits without damaging my hair! I've been to her multiple times now and she always listens to what I want and actually does it, unlike some stylists who just do what they want. Best bob cut I've ever had
5	I've had the privilege of working with Meghan for several years. I've trusted her with doing my  hair and make-up for a weddings and for my hair cuts and color. Specifically Bleaching/lightening.  Meghan is very easy to work with, has incredible attention to detail and is very thorough.  I can't say how thrilled I am every single time I take a look in the mirror.  If you bleach or lighten your hair you have to try the Olaplex treatment that Meghan uses.  I will never go back to traditional lightening ever again.  My hair feels amazing with zero breakage.  Meghan is fashion forward and very creative with out making you look like someone you are not.. This lady has Taste!   This is a special skill that I totally appreciate.  I would recommend her services to anyone who needs to be beautified.   as a bonus the products she uses are the best of the best.
5	Tracy has got me for life. I love my hair so much now. I got an inch and a half off my hair just to trim out my ends, and somehow l left the chair with my hair looking longer than before I got the cut! I love that ! She made my hair look so silky and so smooth. She definitely knows what she's doing and Tracy makes sure to explain things to you along the way in case you have questions.
5	Tracy Basner is the real deal!!  Her knowledge is vast and her color techniques are amazing!!  I am SO HAPPY with my cut and color!!  I have A LOT of hair and she took the time to give me an amazing cut AND to teach me how to reproduce it at home, which is the true test of a great stylist.  PLUS, she's just a blast to hang with- what a great experience!!
