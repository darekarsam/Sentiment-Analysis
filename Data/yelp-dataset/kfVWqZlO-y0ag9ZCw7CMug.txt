5	I have had nothing but amazing experiences here at Graceland! I have taken my car here many times and honestly it is the only shop I will trust in the Pittsburgh area. The guys that work there are honest and direct, there is not beating around the bush to find the problem. Also they are quick, I have my car back ASAP and looking like new!
5	I came in to Pittsburgh from Wisconsin for the weekend and got into an accident on a Friday evening.  My car was not drivable. I needed it to be fixed so I could  get back to Wisconsin on Sunday.  I called Paul D'Amico at Graceland Automotive on Friday at 6:30pm and he said he would do whatever he could to help me.  Paul had my car fixed and ready to go by Saturday afternoon.  He was so kind and willing to help someone in need.  I'm so thankful to him and he did great work as well.  My car has run great since the accident.  Paul runs a fantastic business and really cares about his customers.  Anyone who needs work done on their car in the Pittsburgh area should go straight to Graceland Automotive.
1	I went to Graceland Automotive, but never got around to writing the review. To all of the people who suffered as I suffered, forgive me for not warning you sooner. I got caught in a snow storm on Christmas and had an accident. My insurance company, Geico, towed my car to Graceland for the body work. Unfortunately for me, I have a very nice sound system in my car. The person who worked on my car thought it was nice too, because the IDIOT turned the volume up high enough to blow out my speakers. When I dropped off the car, it was tuned to the CD player. I even went back to the car to get CDs out. So, I'm positive that the CD player was the last thing I accessed on my radio. When I picked up my car, it was tuned to an unknown radio station, and no sound came out of my speakers. Graceland Automotive swore that they never touched my radio and and that it magically changed to a local PA radio station on its own. Since I was not from PA, I had to drive home to VA with no sound and attempt to resolve the issue from there. Of course, Graceland Automotive refused to pay for the damage to my speakers, costing me over $400 in electrical repairs. They also managed to severely damage my steering column when they repaired the damage to the front of the vehicle. I had to send my car back to Geico to get additional repairs at a local shop in VA. These guys are shady, they do shotty work, cause additional damage, and then stick the customers with the bill. Moral of the story: DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR TO GRACELAND AUTOMOTIVE!!!!
