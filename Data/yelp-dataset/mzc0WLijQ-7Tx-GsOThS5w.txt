1	I like to think of myself as an appreciater of art.  I've loved the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Art Institute of Chicago, The National Gallery in London, and, of course, the Smithsonian in DC.  Upon moving to Charlotte, we decided to visit the Museum of Crap + Design (er, Craft + Design) one afternoon (it's free between certain hours on Tuesdays) to check it out.   We quickly breezed our way through it, as what we saw were mostly sticks and twigs stuck into things.  It was not impressive by any means and not "art" in my book.  I'll stick to Charlotte's Mint Museum of Art if I want to see something artsy.
4	I'm a big fan of the Mint Museum of Craft + Design. Their exhibits always feature beautiful works. I really liked "Possibilities: Rising Stars of Contemporary Craft in North Carolina" in the summer. Like Mindy W., I particularly liked the work of Anne Lemanski. Her art involves three-D constructions of animals using politically charged images. Right now, there is also an avant-garde jewelry exhibition at the museum.If you're new in town, appreciate art and are looking to meet people, I'd recommend checking out the Young Affiliates of the Mint. It's a social group for young Mint supporters. They have fun parties and monthly happy hours on the roof of the Mint. It's a great venue because you're in the middle of Uptown's skylines and have a really unique view of the city.
