4	There's nothing that distinguishes the place from any other Advance Auto; and honestly, I'm fine with that. I never have trouble finding the parts I need, and the people are always helpful. The location's pretty easy to get to, and the staff were super fast when replacing my car battery, too.
5	Second to a good mechanic is a good auto parts store. The guys at this Advanced auto consistently give me good advice and provide better solutions without coming off condescending. If you're in the area and want to make sure that you are not getting up sold needlessly, stop by and talk to the guys at advanced auto parts.
4	I've stopped here on multiple occasions and have not been disappointed.  I know this is a chain store, but I can't complain about it.Each time I have stopped in here to get an item I have actually been over helped, if that's a thing.  I know what I need when I walk into a store like this, but that doesn't stop the employees from jumping at the chance to help you out.  The last time I was here I already knew what I needed and where it was, but the guy behind the register yelled back to me that it would be quicker if I went to him and he'd get it for me.*Battery dead?  They will assist you in putting a new one in.
