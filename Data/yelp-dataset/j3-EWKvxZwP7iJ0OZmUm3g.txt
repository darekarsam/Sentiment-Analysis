5	During my recent vacation in Scottsdale I dropped into this PostNet store to mail a package.  While in the store, I noticed the beautiful prints displayed and decided to have some enlargements made of some of my pix.  They made enlargements of one picture of my cats and another I had taken on vacation- an Arizona sunset.  All I had to do was transferring my digital files over to their computer and they took care of the rest, including stretching the canvas on frames. To top it off they packed up my prints and shipped them to my home in California for me so I wouldn't have to haul them home.  Couldn't be easier!The prints turned out gorgeous- the colors match my photos exactly.Highly recommended!

1	I went to this PostNet location to mail two letters, certified mail.  There was no line, but it took over 10 minutes for the gentlemen to complete my very simple transaction.  I was charged over $11.00 per letter - one of which needed to be mailed to a Phoenix address.  The post office charges approximately $6.00 for each of the letters I mailed.  The mark-up at this place is outrageous.  When I asked why the mark-up was so excessive, I was told that it was worth paying for the short wait.  10 minutes for two letters - Give me a break.  I will not be returning.
