1	Just 15 minutes into our initial consultation, Cristi hustled us to sign a $1,500 retainer. She then skipped the next meeting and when we finally met after an addition reschedule, she showed up meeting without her case notes so we had to start over. She literately acted like she wasn't aware of anything about case. To make matters worse,  she spent much of the session talking about her own divorce and making suggestions based on her own experience rather than what was best for us. At one point, she turned to me and snapped "so what are you demanding know?" Given the unprofessional nature of her relationship with us, my wife and I decided to cut our loses and leave her practice. She still had the audacity to bill us an addition $260 for her email communication with us. Please AVOID using her at all cost!
5	Excellent attorney.
