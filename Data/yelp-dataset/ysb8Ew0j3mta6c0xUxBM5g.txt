5	My girlfriends and I (the Girl Posse) were looking for something to do on a Saturday Night.  Being that we're all married 30-something(some with kids) music fans, we don't always get a chance to get together and head out to a show.  But somehow the planets were aligned and the whole bunch went out to Moondog's for some great live music.This is another one of those places in which I can't believe I'm the first to review.  Moondog's is a local institution, people!  It's been around here ever since I can remember.  Rusted Root played here in their pre-"Send Me On My Way" days.It's everything you want in a small music venue.  Although does mean a slightly cramped seating area and the requisite long lines for the restrooms, it's a great intimate venue to see live music.  And Moondog's brings in the music!  It has everything from rock to blues to folk music.  The Starlite Lounge Restaurant is next door and you can order food from there and bring it into the club.  It's local music folks.  Come out and support it!

Moondogs is a great blues club with ample room, great sound and a hard working bartender. The drinks are cheap, and not great, but if you keep it simple, they do the trick. It's an older crowed, which is fine for me. The covers are cheap and they get some great acts. I went to see State College's Miss Melanie and the Valley Rats, and I'm so grateful I did. I plan to go back this weekend, and probably many more times.
