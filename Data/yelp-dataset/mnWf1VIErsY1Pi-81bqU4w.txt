5	Rick was pleasant, knowledgeable, timely, and his prices were very reasonable.  In fact, when the repairs were finished, Rick was able to cut the cost down from the initial estimate he quoted us for the repair of three blinds/shades.  We were very pleased with Jeannie's Blind Repair, our shades work better than new, and we highly recommend this company for any shade/blind repair needs you might have.
5	friendly, professional, quick, easy to work with, great repairs on site or drop off to save a few $, great value and service versus buying new at %-10X the cost. Will use again.
1	Went on their website and requested a callback 3 days ago. Still waiting for them to call.
5	Great experience.  Rick is a really friendly guy, very knowledgeable on blinds.  I was able to text photos to his son (office manager) which made the repairs easier.  Very reasonably priced.  Replaced all four brackets since three were broken and an older style.  Only charged me for one bracket.  I highly recommend.  But I would call as it's a family run business.
1	Requested an in-home repair for a vertical blind. They advised that a technician would come on Friday Oct 17 between 8AM and 10 AM. He never showed up nor called to advise.I called again and the technician accused me that my phone does not work???????When I protested that he was wrong he got irate and told me that he would not come at all.Great negative service!
5	I don't normally leave reviews but Heath was so amazing and helpful I wanted to share my great experience. A rescue dog ate 6 (yes 6!) sets of my plantation shutters :( Heath was so awesome he took such great care of me!! He was so honest and genuine and even followed up with me to make sure I was happy afterwards. Such a rare thing these days to know you are being taken care of by a good person. I would recommend him to anyone looking for quality blind repair.
