5	Always friendly. This cleaner has a drive-thru and gives you a bag w/ label tag to take with you for your clothes on return visit. They remember you by name and always get the clothes pristinely clean. I have not used their tailoring services, so I cannot review.
5	Pick ups and drop offs 2 days later! This place is great. I have been using their service for 4 years. Always on time and do a great job with the clothes!
1	Dont use ECOCLEANERS unless you want to pay $4.50 per pants to be dry cleaned and ironed with double leg creases, pay $2.25 per shirt to be laundered only to have your buttoned shirts ripped with their machine press and then when confronted, deny fault and accuse the Customer of ripping it. And to pay no attention to any of the service notes on the Laundry Bag tags that they provide and write up.All I can say after using ECOCLEANERS is "Wow. They suck."And I have never ever been accused of sabotaging my own clothes when I point out a ripped button, snag-line in the fabric, etc especially with a Dry Cleaners who uses machine presses instead of pressing by hand. Most Cleaners will admit thats a known issue when using machine presses, and replace your item without much hassle. But no... Not ECOCLEANERS. Had to be the Customer's fault.I sorely miss the quality and customer service of Boston Cleaners.EcoCleaners can close up shop and do this neighborhood a favor.
1	This location is open across from WalMart. I gave them 2 chances to do a good job and both times, they screwed up my cleaning/alteration order. The first time, their "1 day service" alterations took 5 days and a simple pants hemming costs $36. The second time, they lost a pair of dress trousers for two weeks, but still charged me for the service when they did find them. There are too many other options for cleaning in Vegas to put up with their crap. I'll not be back.
