5	Simply. I love these guys. They go above and beyond to help me. My accountant is Andrew McClintic. He's one of those guys who looks for ways to help me take advantage of tax laws, but keeps things honest and clear so if I ever was audited, everything would be on the up and up. Perfect. Highly suggested.
5	Andrew has done my taxes for the last 3 years based on a friends recommendation.   The first couple of time he helped me navigate through some serious financial issues I had made in my early years.  The outcome was very favorable thanks to his excellent advice.  This year he really came through for me and my family, and it took less time the the previous years and emailing back and forth made things very convenient.   Thank you andrew for the excellent work!
5	For the past five years Larry and Katie have helped me with everything from basic tax services to purchasing and running my business. Every step along the way they have been a great help. They are always quick to respond to my endless questions and have even met with me after hours when necessary. Overall a friendly group that goes above and beyond to help you!
