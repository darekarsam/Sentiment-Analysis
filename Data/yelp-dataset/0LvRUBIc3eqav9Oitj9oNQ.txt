4	I came here 7 am sharp as an early bird. Came back from vacation in Bangladesh so  didnt have grocery done and thanks to jet lagging woke up early at 5, anyways left as fast as I could and came straight here. It wasn't too busy when I went there and there was only one waitress serving. I was happy with the fast and polite service. The restaurant was very colorfully designed with typical tutti fuiti decor. Lots of hens and farm animals will keep you company in case you come in for a coffee alone in the morning. I had a smoked salmon bagel cream cheese that came with a loooot of fruits which i didnt mind because I was craving a whole of canadian goodies, Their hot chocolate is a bit watery but I did enjoy the bagel. Overall, it was a good experience.
1	My waffles were sour inside, my wife had to return her Benedictines with mushrooms, because they had disgusting smell. Service was mediocre due to the fact that only one waitress was serving the whole place during Saturday morning. The only thing they are able to make decent is flipped eggs and bacon. Don't risk ordering anything else here. My wife's verdict: "never again".
