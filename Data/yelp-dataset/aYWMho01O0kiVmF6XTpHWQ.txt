5	SANTA CLARA, CALIF. ----- VISITOR LUVS THIS PLACE. LARGE SELECTION. PRICES WERE HIGH LIKE SAN FRANCISCO PRICES. I WAS EXPECTING CHEAPER PRICES IN PA BECAUSE EVERYTHING ELSE IS ABOUT 20-25% CHEAPER HERE.  They did negotiate down 20% so that was good. I would recommend offering less.  Items that were priced at say E.G..... $45 dollars i thought should have been about $25, etc...... My parents were in an antique coop in Sunnyvale Caifornia and i know high prices when i see it. SO MAYBE THEY PRICE HIGH TO FACTOR IN NEGOTIATION???
5	Lots of stuff, could take hours to explore, and very friendly people ...
5	Best Antique Mall in Pittsburgh. Best Selection on furniture, glassware, antique toys etc. Tons of inventory. There is something here for every collector!
