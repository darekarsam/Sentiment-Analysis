5	My daughters have been dancing at Miller Street Dance Academy for over 5 years now and I have nothing but positive things to say about our experience there. The instructors are not only skilled dancers but excellent teachers. There is very, very low staff turnover which leads to lots of stability and consistency in the classrooms. They teach strong fundamentals of dance but also make it fun and engaging. The owner has a degree in education and a child-friendly approach that clearly resonates throughout her studio.As a parent I appreciate the conservative approach Miller Street takes to costumes as well as their reinforcement of good values in their students. Respect, teamwork, patience, accountability and community are all emphasized. They even have a homework room at the studio that emphasizes the importance of schoolwork to dancers. These lessons will extend far beyond my girls dancing years. Miller Street Dance Academy is top notch. I'm so glad to have found this positive environment.
