3	I stayed here because it is a Marriott property, and it is obvious that some upgrading has been applied at this hotel.  The rooms are ok, but still lack the feel of a real suite.  Rooms are clean and the staff is friendly.
2	I should have known better than to stay here when there was a sign at the front desk offering earplugs for light sleepers, but it was midnight so I gave it a shit.  Lots of road noise, I didn't get any sleep.Room was cramped - the crammed a "suite" in the size of a standard hotel room.  Breakfast was an upgrade from the standard continental.  Eggs and sausage as well as the normal waffles and pastry.I would recommend the nearby Courtyard instead if you are a light sleeper.
3	If there is one thing I like about Marriott hotels, it's that you know what you're going to get: clean rooms and a nice place to stay. The front desk ladies were very nice and helpful with places to eat in the area. In the mornings they do serve coffee and a complimentary breakfast. If you're looking for a full breakfast with eggs, I would recommend just going down the road to the cracker barrel. Being here for business, Spring Hill Suites sets the rooms up nicely to have your office area and plenty of room to spread out. Best part is that WiFi is free! The room was clean and had everything I needed for the two days I stayed.
2	The good:  inexpensive; free airport shuttle, wifi and breakfast.The bad: it's loud (they actually offer free earplugs... not joking); shuttle is often really late; no decent dining options nearbyThe ugly: hotel is deep in the ghetto (nearby supermarket has security guard to walk customers to their car); hotel is right next to a strip clubConsider avoiding this place and stay at a hotel off Billy Graham Pkwy instead
