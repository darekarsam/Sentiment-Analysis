1	Most incompetent doctors office I have ever been to. Stay away at all costs. I am still getting bills in the mail from three years ago because they couldn't figure out how to bill my insurance correctly.
5	To say that Dr. Nnadi cares more about money than her patients is a clear indication that "Kominike A." doesn't know Dr. Nnadi. There is a reason why it is called "Family FIRST Medical." There is also a reason why her patients have been loyal to her ever since her practice began. She is simply the best!
