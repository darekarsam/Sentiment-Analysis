5	Good selection and friendly people.
4	I was impressed the first time I popped in this location. I didn't have high hopes since I was used to the Northport location. I found most of everything I was looking for and even one type of Japanese Maple I thought I'd never see here in a store in WI. If the drive weren't so far for me, I would shop here more frequently.
5	cute, adorable, charming!!!!!!!!!! the associates are very savvy with gardening tips and knowledgeable. Please ask them for any concerns or questions on plants. They will give you the best tips. My yard looks beautiful thanks to proper advice and help from Jungs. Not as cheap as wal mart nursery but you get what you pay for
