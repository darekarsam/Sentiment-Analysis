4	Best bar in Laval, period. Unbelievable selection of beer. Prices are good and ambiance is ok. Only problem is food selection suck. Expensive food.
1	If I wanted to hang out in St Jerome... I would go to St Jerome. The dbag levels were off the charts, even by Laval standards. I found nothing endearing about this place to report on. Large Quebec beer selection, but pathetic hard liquor selection. If you're not into mediocre beer then you're going to be disappointed with what's on the shelf. Live music... I guess that's what it was. I'd rather pierce my own nipples then go through that again. And some obnoxious guy with bad tattoos would pretend it was his own personal karaoke machine and sing along on stage, into the musicians mic. I think he was the owner or manager. Service was ok. I don't like chasing the waiter for 20 minutes just to pay. This is your place if you remember Fuzzy as a great place. And if you're from Brossard, and are looking for a place to hang out in, look no further.
