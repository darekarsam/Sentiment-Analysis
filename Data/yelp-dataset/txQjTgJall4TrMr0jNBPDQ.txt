5	I really do wish I could remember the names of the people that have helped us when going into Kirkland. They were amazing some of the best customer service I have ever experienced. You can tell that the employees are very happy here or it seems like. The lady that helped us explained how beneficial it was to get on their rewards program. Which in my Mom's case it is absolutely true she's in here at least three times a month if not more!They always have really nice things for your home. At first I thought this store was not for me and I didn't know what I was missing.  They have something for everyone.  I had bought an accent table for my living room at Marshalls, and I found something better here for about the same price.  I really do wish I would of at least stopped here before purchasing it. Kirkland has a variety of items such as: Candles, tables, clocks, things for your man cave, table center pieces, a lot of things for your kitchen. I mean everything.  And believe me they are ways willing to answer any of the questions that you may have about how something works or an item.
5	Great clearance sale..extra 25% off clearance prices. I ended up getting 2 Mystque flameless timed candles for $30, casual style chandelier for $27 & a colored ceramic bottle for decor got $4.  Very excited about the deals & the these few items will make a difference in my living room. Go now before the sale ends.
