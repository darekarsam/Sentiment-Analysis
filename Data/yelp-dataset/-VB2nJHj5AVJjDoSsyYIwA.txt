3	For a change of pace, we stopped at a Sonic rather than, well, any other fast food place.  I don't usually think of Sonic when I think fast food, so it wasn't an entirely bad choice, because I like variety - even if it is of the fast food kind.  What's more is that Sonic has breakfast, and I'm a big fan of breakfast.Unfortunately, they don't do it well.While the staff is very friendly in the drive-in format (missing only the roller skates), they are probably one of the worst for putting up a picture of something on the menu board and then delivering something that looks about as far from that item as possible.I ordered a breakfast burrito of some kind and what I got looked nothing at all like what was on the board.  It had all the ingredients, but there is no way what I received could ever have been made to look like what was on the menu board.It might have tasted the same, but it looked like slop.  Very disappointing indeed.

It was cheap, fast, and they had some tasty burgers and hot dogs.Sonic, famous for their shakes and all their commercials with two guys sitting in the car talking about food doesn't really do it quite justice compared to the commercial. Personally, I enjoyed it, except it's not to the point where I will be going to whenever I finish a movie.Overall, if you're hungry for some quick food (at least when it's not busy) and semi-cheap.. This is the place to go! Plus, it's nice to travel back in time and see how they got down with the roller skater waitresses and the drive in/eating in your car.
