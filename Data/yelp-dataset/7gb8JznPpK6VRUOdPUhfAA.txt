5	Andrew is very professional and communicates well. He is also flexible, which is greatly appreciated. And most importantly - the windows look fantastic!
5	New to the area, and my neighbor recommended Andrew s Window Cleaning.When a huge rain storm brought an overload of leaves to the gutters, we called AWC.  Andrew was able to rework his schedule to remedy our problem.  A few weeks later, he was able to clean the windows inside and outside.He did an amazing job!  The windows are spotless!  He is a person who is accommodating and polite.  You won t be disappointed in the work!
5	I join the other five-star satisfied customers with praise for Andrew and his sincere, thorough, straight-up business.Andrew does the work himself.  He does not sub-contract to others, so he keeps the level of quality high to his standards.  And he is a very affable guy with an interesting background.He spent ten years flying regional airplanes all over the country.  Missing his family, he left the airlines to be an entrepreneur, starting this window washing and power washing business.  And he is doing so well.His prices are based on number of windows and is so reasonable and realistic.  He can charge less than others because he does the work himself, is very efficient and does not doodle around.  He chats with you but his arms are moving and he is like a human machine.  Love to see how easy it makes it look.If you bundle by also having your house power washed, both services are less.He did our 28 windows, inside and out and did all the screens.  Very fine.In the spring we will have him back out to spray wash the house and deck and then do the outside windows.  In the fall, inside and outside windows.Great guy worthy of your business.  You will be pleased as punch that you read this and called him.
