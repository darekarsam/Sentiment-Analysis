5	5 star rating.   I called Liberty Home Repair to fix my sliding patio door that was stuck  Dror showed up to give a quote and instead went ahead and fixed it right on the spot.  He was polite and efficient.   I recommend him to others who need home repair services   The pricing was reasonable as well.
5	Prompt, clean, polite! Dror did a very professional job of drywall and texture for me. He seems to know how to do any home project. He is my first choice for handyman work now!
5	Great service. Liberty home repair has been doing odd jobs for me for a few years now as well as my front and back lawn. Always on time always pleasant and always clean!Thank you!
5	We had a huge Christmas celebration at our home resulting in a person knocking a 4x8 arcadia door out of action and leaving us with what appeared to be broken rollers. Nobody could open or close the door so I was on the phone first thing Friday morning. Couldn't get any answers or call backs until I called Liberty where Dror returned my call within minutes. I asked him to come out and take a look. Long story short, he fixed it in a matter of minutes and then took time to clean the tracks and lube everything leaving us with smooth rolling arcadia and screen doors. Problem resolved and he is now our go to guy for our upcoming home repair projects. Thanks Dror for a job well done
