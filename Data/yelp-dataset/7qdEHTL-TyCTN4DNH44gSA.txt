2	Slowest.Subway.Ever.
2	It's Subway so there aren't a lot of gold stars to be handed out for microwaving pre-cooked meat that's been sitting around all day.  Subway is usually consistent, but this one doesn't have the currently advertised oven crisp chicken nor do they have the veggie burger type patties.  They seem to be a little skimpy with the food too.  I only stop here because it's on the way home.  Much prefer Jersey Mike's though.
