3	It has all the stores I need. It's not far from where I used to live. I have no complaints. A small face lift (which is what's happening now) is what's needed to spruce things up but besides that, can't complain.
4	This place had kind of become so so in recent years but the renovations have really turned it around and it's starting to pick up again.  They've brought in a bunch of new stores and really spruced the place up.  The new food court is also pretty good by mall standards.
3	indoor downtown #2!basically what you find downtown can be most definitely be found there too and its indoor so no need to freeze yourself during winter.thing is there's literally nothing around with it being next to the highway. it totally feels like laval in a way.. you don't go there for a quick shopping trip!the shopping center is fine in itself despite being packed full during the holidays and extremely hot and there isn't much place to sit.as for the food court, its shopping mall food aka don't be picky fast food.
