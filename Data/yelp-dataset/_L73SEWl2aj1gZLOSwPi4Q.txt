5	I love Kathy's new location! The space has great energy flow & Kathy is as amazing as ever! The reiki session I had here was awesome and really relaxed me. It was really great & so are her massages. Afterwards, she gave me some milk bath mix and some chakra 7 smelling salts also for a bath & I was very impressed by them! I was super soft and relaxed after both. She also sells beautiful jewelry! I would recommend anyone come to visit her healing center for quality work. She has way higher quality work than massage envy at a very serene location.
5	I hit the Jackpot with OM Body.. I found Kathy through Yelp. Her massage was gentle but deep working on every part of my body except for the obvious private areas.I love shopping with small local businesses... Kathy gave me the best massage ever. Her office is calm and comfortable.. She took her time with answering questions and offer her professional advise. Kathy does volunteer work at the hospital which I thought was a very nice thing to do.  NUTSHELL Nice office.. small business and excellent work. Thanks OMBodyworks I think it should be call OMGbodyworks..lol
4	I took my fiancee' in there last Sunday for a 1 1/2 hour massage. This included a facial massage plus a foot massage. The price was reasonable. My fiancee' said Kathy was just fabulous. Kathy did not massage any area my fiancee' did not want massaged. Next I am going to treat myself. If you are looking for a really great massage, please book some time with Kathy. It is private so you don't hear any other conversations.
