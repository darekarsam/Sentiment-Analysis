2	There was literally no crust to this pizza. And by no crust, I don't mean "thin crust." Essentially, it was a mass of cheese piled on a cluster of flaccid, greasy cardboard. On the plus side, the cheese and sauce were tasty enough. For $3, it's cheap enough to try, but the service is poor and highly variable. Come on Union South, step it up. Train your employees how to properly cook.
2	The only thing good about their pizza slices is the price. The pizza includes way too much cheese for my tastes and is consequently far too greasy. Half the cheese would be a good starting point for me. The underlying crust supporting the toppings is usually anything but crusty. Next time I'll see if they can put the slice back in the pizza oven like some places do...
3	All I can say is that urban slice is pretty inconsistent. With students making the pizza you don't know what you're going to get half the time. Sometimes it's perfect, nice and crispy with the right amount of toppings. But other times it's either burnt black or undercooked and just a floppy greasy mess. For under 3 bucks for a huge slice I can't complain, but I'd take a look at the pizza on display before ordering
