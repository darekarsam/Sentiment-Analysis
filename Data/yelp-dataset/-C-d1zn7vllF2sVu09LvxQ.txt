3	La P'tite Folie in Frederick Street in Edinburgh is a nice rustic French restaurant. We had a fairly big party of 16, and the staff were very good. The quality of the food is superb - their steak in particular is excellent. There was a problem with the bill - the menu that had been provided in advance said that there would be no service charge, but the waitress added a 10% charge to both the food and drinks bill. This was sorted out by the owner the following day. Hopefully this was a one-off.
3	Food was great especially the roast lamb. Was a bit disappointed they served boring fries with the steak though and the service was frosty.
3	Food was pretty standard French fare. Service was a bit on the slow side with just one person manning the entire restaurant, so be aware of how long you'll be sitting there before you order, get your food, etc. I did like how they gave a small salad to share among the table.
5	What a wonderful find!  We had 4 people for lunch -- great risotto with butternut squash & mushrooms, mussels were insanely good, fresh fish cooked perfectly, sticky toffee pudding for dessert was the best.  A very nice wine list -- we had a terrific rose.  A must if you are in Edinburgh and want a nice relaxing lunch with wonderful service.
