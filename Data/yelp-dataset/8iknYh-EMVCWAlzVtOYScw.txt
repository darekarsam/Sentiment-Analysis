4	Hope they keep this store if BN has any plans of closing more stores.  We used to come here to study; then it was to peruse after we started our professional careers.  Now, we come here as a family to pick out books for our toddler.  Good times!
5	Always has what I need, friendly staff.. Clean restrooms.. & a cool place to hang while deciding if the read or mag is worth it over a nice cup of coffee..
3	The customer service was lacking.  Other than that I love that it has a Starbucks and you can sip on some coffee while you read a good book
4	Barnes and Nobel is a Great Family Place to read and grab a cold drink.Barnes and Nobel is a good place for current titles. The staff is always helpful, friendly and courteous. As a member, I enjoy the special discounts and the great variety of "bargain books."  My visit's to Barnes and Nobel are always an adventure! I bring my nephew to Barnes and Nobel for family time.  We enjoy looking for books and reading.Barnes and Nobel is also a nice place to grab a quick bite and some coffee. Maybe get some work done or just some quite time to sit and read.
5	I absolutely love coming here. My daughter and i can spend hours sitting in the children's section playing with the trains or reading books and no one disturbs us. I was having problems with my nook a few months ago and after getting no where with the online customer service i decided to come to the store to see if they could help me. The 2 employees that helped me out were so friendly and helpful. After figuring out that my nook had a faulty charging portal they swapped it out for a new one and i was one my way.
