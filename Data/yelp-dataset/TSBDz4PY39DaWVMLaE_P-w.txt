5	Upscale paradise bakery that has gluten-free options and a killer black currant ice tea. They also provide free wifi and a great area to plugin and work on my computer for a couple hours.
5	Drove past last night and noticed a new Bakery. Came to eat first thing in the morning to find out it was opening morning for the Bakery. I had the Apple Cranberry Oatmeal, and a  frappe Mocha. Both were very good. Oatmeal was a nice sized portion and very good.
5	This place is awesome, the service is great and the food is tasty. I had the Mac and cheese, the pasta was well cooked and the breadcrumbs were toasted nicely. The sauce could have been a little thicker though. The bread served on the side is phenomenal. There is also free and fast WiFi, which is great for staying productive while grabbing something to eat.
4	I work very close and often come for breakfast and lunch, The food has always been good and I love that they have gluten free options. It can be pricey if you do choose the gluten free bread though ($2).  I'd rather not spend $10 a day for lunch.  The wait service is pretty attentive and I can tell they are trying to make a good impression.
