5	I have been all over and had plenty of Italian food. I looked around my hotel for something good to eat I saw a picture of a little fat man that is pretty much the symbol of Italian food. I was expecting a pizzaria or some kind of mom and pop shop. Giorgio is defiantly not either of those. I suddenly realized that I was under dressed in my t-shirt and jeans. Still the server showed me to my seat and was very quick to realize french was not my first language and offered me an English menu. I always feel bad coming to another country and not being able to speak the language. Still the waiter made me feel at home, trying his best to explain the things I didn't understand.I was expecting the Olive Garden style of food and service. It was slightly busy so I expected my order to take a little while. But then something strange happened. I got my food before my drink, and not in a bad way. About 5 minutes after ordering my drink and food I had my food (and a minute later my drink). Not only was the pasta fast it was fantastic. The portions were very nice sized and I left happy. While a little on the pricy side for my usual taste this place is worth every penny.

The food was delicious, the dessert was fantastic and the servers were very polite. Ah, you can also bring your own wine. I really enjoyed the evening and I would certainly come back. Highly recommended.
