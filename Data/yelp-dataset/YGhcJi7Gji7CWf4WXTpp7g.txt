5	First review?  Ok.  Dr Luberto is great.  Going to him for physicals, sports related injuries, and other needs since i was a teenager.  Great accreditation since he is still the team physician for the Phoenix Coyotes.  I would recommend him to anybody.
3	Dr loberto is and always has been great! The only reason i am giving them 3 stars is due to the front staff. Every time I go in I always feel uncomfortable due to the rude staff. Not only when I go in but also when I call they are rude and quick to get off the phone. I understand they are busy but treating your customers that way in unacceptable. When looking at reviews else where this seems to be a common complaint. I'm hoping this is something they will tAke serious and make a change. Other then that I enjoy loberto.
3	Luberto is a wonderful dr for everyone in my family, April too. We've been going here for a few years (since Morton was here). The biggest problem is the front desk staff. Finding another Dr is a pain but we're getting fed up with three rudeness and gossip. And i know this isn't directly thieir fault but the student nurses they get are cold and don't care...Luberto and April ate great though!!
