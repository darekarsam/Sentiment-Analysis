4	Wow, feels like China again.The food tastes just like any cantine in a Chinese university. The price is fair, and the portions are huge. The only downside is that their dishes usually taste a bit too salty.
3	Taking a star off here, because I was yelled at by the cleaning lady there.Apparently it was an unforgivable sin to stack my used plate on top of another used plate, because it will make the upper plate "dirty at the bottom".How the if-you-see-kay does that even make sense? Don't you wash the bottom of your plates?Well, it made me feel homesick again, because in China, waiters yell at you! ;)P.S.: Food was still so darn good.
3	Food was great, feels like home cooking.Jian Bing was a bit bland and oily.
4	Best value you'll find for a great plate of food. The pork spine is so good and worth a try if they have it.You can't beat the price and the selections are interesting. There is no English or French menu. You just punt at the prepared buffet style food and she loads up the plate. Best meal in the area for under $10.
4	Honestly one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in Montreal. I love the gritty and bare-boned, no-effs-given nature of this restaurant cafeteria. How did this place get by the language laws, anyway? Assuming you speak their language, the servers are typically polite and courteous. As you gorge yourself upon 3 authentic home-style Mainland Chinese dishes with a side of rice, all for $8, you can watch the latest CCTV-produced Chinese documentary about some completely random aspect of the glorious country from their television. Seriously, if you want something fast and cheap, hit this place up. Bonus points for their $2 Beijing-style baozis. Tastes like my grandmother's cooking.
