5	Great pizza. The best on the south shore
2	Trop graisseux...
4	Great pizza! Very consistent. If you like greasy mom & pop sloppy pizza overloaded with cheese and toppings this is your place on the south shore. The decor isn't exactly fresh and modern, but neither is the pizza;))
5	Simply the best pizza you will ever have in GMA or maybe in your life as long as you don't mind the grease
3	Can it be possible to have too much cheese?  Good pizza but way too greasy and salty for me.
5	Best pizza ever!! Seriously i don't know what they put in that pizza but it's GOOD!! I have tried the following: Pizza , spaghetti , lasagna.  All of them were good nothing to complaint about. It was so good that i decided to order some frozen  pasta sauce and bring it home and make my mama try it! She obviously loved it ! I had a all dress pizza with bacon. Very good and the waitress was very friendly. I love the fact that they have that retractable table for the pizza very clever idea and every pizza place should have it! The pizza was very good and the bacon crispy. I had a desert which seemed to be fried dough with some sugar and sirop dont remember the name but that was good too. The only downside is that they dont have coke they have pepsi :( Cheers,Eric Van Nguyen
3	Good breakfast, inexpensive and fast
2	Fast delivery, decent prices, you get a lot for you dollar, but i cant recommend this pizza, way way too greasy. I don't even understand how you can like this...
