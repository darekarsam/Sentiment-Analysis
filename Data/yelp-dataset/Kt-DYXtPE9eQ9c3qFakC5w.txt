2	Check your order! I've been too many Firehouse's in the valley and this one is by far the worst at following directions. I've been to this location 5 times and all 5 times they screw up my order. What part of No Onions and No Tomatoes is hard?? I will drive out of my way to avoid this location in the future.
5	I thought the service was great! The manager was awesome and complimented my style. It made me feel special. Looking forward to going again!
3	Never been here before. They greeted me right away and offered to go thru the menu and gave recommendations. nice service. tried the steak and cheese sub, it was ok. next time I will try something else. overall I would go back. parking was hard to find during lunch time, nice day didn't mind walking.
3	I love FireHouse Subs. I've been to locations in about 7 different states as I travel ALOT for work.This particular location fell short compared to others for a few reasons.Lets start by saying that is was not the food. The sandwiches were good. The quality of the food was on par with any other location I've been to. The problems with this location for me was the cleanliness of the dining area. It was hectic and unkept. The only table and chairs available were soaking wet with cleaning spray. More than likely not cleaned correctly because they had 10 year olds walking around cleaning tables and greeting guests.The entire operation seemed unorganized and hectic. The employees didn't seem friendly or particularly thrilled to be there.It wasn't a horrible experience by any means but if I were to compare it to any of the many other Fire House subs experiences I've had in the past. It wasn't good.
