1	I called AAA Arizona  when my ignition switch would not turn. I was referred to Advanced Lock Service by AAA as they are an approved service provider by AAA. I was told that it would be about 2 hours before a tech could come to look at my car. Not a big deal because I was home for the evening. I got a call back a few minutes later and was advised that a tech would be to my house in about 45 minutes. I thought "wow, that's great". I was then told that I had $50.00 coverage with my AAA membership and it would be an additional $535.00 to repair my ignition switch. I asked the gentleman how he could know what was wrong with my car without even looking at it. He responded that this was a common problem with this type of car and was a very labor intensive repair. I respectfully declined their service.The next day, I called another locksmith and paid 60.00 for the repair which consisted of replacing some worn tumblers in the ignition switch. The repair took about 30 minutes. I think I'm gonna call AAA and tell them about my experience.
