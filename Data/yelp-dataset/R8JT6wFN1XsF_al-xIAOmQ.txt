4	Stumbled into this place over Labor Day 2013. Went in around 10:30 PM, it was dead dead dead. Like 15 people & mostly women there.  Having been hand stamped, we left to SKY for about an hour and cheap ($2) cocktails. Then returned to Apollon around 11:30. It was crowded and the DJ was live. Great music (Club / House) - great lighting, thanks to the DJ's "laser props". Cocktails are more typically priced @ $7.  Cute Go-Go boys also. Women were very outnumbered also - mostly all men at that hour. PS - not against women at the Gay clubs, just tire of the "bachelorette parties"  showing up at the Gay clubs to make a fool of themselves & fawn over the gay boys. (Yes, they were here - complete with the wedding veil !)Fun place, but don't get there much before 11:30 ...
1	This place is pretty bad if you are 18-24. I am 20 and my friends are the same age. We had a horrible time here. All of the guys are old and the young ones weren't attractive. The dance floor was too small and the music wasn't even loud. Lighting was awful and the smoke machines couldn't even hide the old people. Drinks were ok and were cheap. I will give them that. Overall unity is definitely better. No doubt in my mind if you are 18-24. I am sure not going back to Apollon. This place had 28-50 year olds everywhere.
1	I went here on a Saturday night around 1:30 a.m., and paid an $8 CAD cover -- It was hopping still and I stayed for 30 minutes, and left, and am now writing this Yelp review. Definitely NOT worth the cover. If you are into screaming Quebecois scene queens, bartenders that are inattentive and outdated electronica music, by all means, go here! Otherwise, I would really look for another venue, especially if you are younger than 25. Lastly, someone warned me that lots of people who go here tend to do hard drugs. I don't want to judge anyone, but I do want to flag it for other people.
