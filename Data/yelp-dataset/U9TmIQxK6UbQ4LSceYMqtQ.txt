5	A fantastic shop! Besides the vintage guitars and amps for sale, the staff are friendly and skilled luthiers. I've been there numerous times and they've assisted me with everything from a quick string purchase to setting up new guitars. Fine, fine independent shop in a world dominated by chains.
5	Amazing work, time after time, I have taken my instruments to Advanced Guitar and the staff and owner have always been great. I have over 32 guitars and after going thru most everyone in las vegas reputable, I landed on jims door step pleading for help with a few real problem child guitars, Impossible fixes made possible by Jim and Billy (RIP he now works for Circe Du Soile...lol) 90% of the time jim nails it on the first fun sometimes things still need a little more tweaking but He always supports his work and always comes thru with flying colors. Thanks Jim and Advanced Guitar for Keeping my instruments on Stage and performing like a pro. Bruce Sneath
5	I brought them a nice Tacoma flat-top with a broken headstock just above the nut.  I wasn't expecting much due to the extent of the damage.  The finished repair far exceeded my expectations.  I don't think anyone would even know it had been repaired by looking at the guitar.  They also worked on the action and leveled the frets.  The guitar now plays like a $10,000 McPherson.    They even repaired a small crack in the top, and a few other things for free.  I couldn't be more pleased with the service and quality of their work.  And  all for a reasonable price.
