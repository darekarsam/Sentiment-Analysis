4	Monday to Friday, 4 p.m. to 3 a.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 9 p.m. to 3 a.m.I have been here twice on two occasions on trips from the US. Its pretty decent and eclectic scene.Booze is normal price at $6 for mixed drinks.  Everyone is easy going and the music is pretty good and loud (rock, punk, psychobilly,etc). The selection depends on whose the bartender that night since there is no juke box.The only thing significant I noticed is it doesnt pickup till about 10PM till 1030 PM. If you show up before that dont be surprise if it seems dead.  But come the "magic" hour the place will fill up in like 10-15 minutes. Pretty impressive.Its off the Mont Royal Metro stop if your riding the subway.
4	Totally not pretentious, which is a nice change. The music is pretty solid, and super loud. It's a pretty small place, but everyone is super chill. No need to dress up because people are there to have a good time, and not to try and score phone numbers!
3	Decent priced drinks, unpretentious atmosphere, and a dance-pub vibe. A good place to go out with a group of friends, but I wouldn't suggest it as a place to wander into and join in on a dance party.
4	I hadn't been to the Rockette in a few years and a recent visit I'm happy to report it hasn't changed much.  They still have good music, 2 for $X beer specials, and lots of young people dancing up a storm.  I did feel a bit old as the night wore on, but I think that has more to do with me than with the bar itself, heh.   Beware though, on Saturdays it only opens at 10pm unlike the timing the RJ has posted in his review, so perhaps a quick check of their facebook page is in order(or whatever social media has replaced facebook by the time you read this).  When we first arrived just after 10pm the place was dead, but it quickly filled up and all of a sudden somewhere around 11:30 the place was wall to wall people, with barely any room on the dancefloor.
