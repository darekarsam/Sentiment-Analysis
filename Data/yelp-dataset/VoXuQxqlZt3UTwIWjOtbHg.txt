5	Excellent workshop. Okello taught the basics of Aperture, ISO, and shutter speed and how together you can use these to get the best shots in any situation. Great class!
1	DO NOT BUY CLASSES FROM THIS BUSINESS: After attending a class in Pittsburgh, I purchased Okello's online courses. I did not receive a code for the classes in a timely manner and we agreed to a refund. It has now been months and he has not responded to any of my repeated attempts to contact him through Facebook, his website or the phone number listed. Especially after seeing that he is responding to questions about photos, I feel like this is extremely unprofessional and caution everyone from making purchases from him. Update: 3 1/2 months later, I have had to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau because I still can not get a response from this business. I see he has upcoming workshops and hope that others can see this before making a purchase. I wish I had been warned!
5	Great session. I learned more in 3 hours than I did in years of tinkering with my camera.  Okello answered a lot of questions and knew specifics to my camera! Great for beginners
4	Excellent class, excellent teacher. I left with way more knowledge then I came with. Great presentation...easy to follow. ..3 hours flew by! Highly recommended!
