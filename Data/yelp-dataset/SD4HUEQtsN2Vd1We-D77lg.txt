5	I love this studio.  My daughter has learned so much since she started.  The teachers really know their stuff and how to teach the kids in a way that is positive and encouraging and nurturing.  My wife and I as well as my daughter have always felt welcome there since the beginning. I also like how it's a family runned studio.
5	A GREAT PLACE!Fun and Family Friendly, that gives quality lessons and has many performance opportunites.
1	I originally signed up my 2 year old daughter for one of their beginner classes. When I arrived, there was an older woman in the waiting area. She didn't introduce herself or offer any help. Apparently, she works at the dance studio. We awkwardly waited in the dirty, run down waiting area for our class to begin. There were no other parents or children present. When the class was supposed to begin the doors of the dance studio opened and 2 young girls, I assume the instructors came out. They just looked at us and said, "Uh, want to come in?" My daughter was terrified and there was an all around creepy feeling about this place. It's dirty and the staff seem spaced out and unable to communicate helpful information about their studio. I asked if there would be other kids joining the class and they said they didn't know. This was one of the most bizarre and unnerving experiences I've ever had. Fortunately, they issued me a refund and we left immediately. I would never return to this studio.
