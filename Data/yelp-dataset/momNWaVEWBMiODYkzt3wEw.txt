1	Never go there! HORRIBLE customer service. A security tag randomly fell from a top I tried on in the dressing room but all the items I tried on had tags on them. I didn't think anything of the security tag that fell so I went to check out and 2 employees, including an Asian lady who was extremely rude, scolded at me about the tag. I said I don't know, didn't do anything and she continued to question me in a loud voice. She gave me a bad look when I left. Flat out horrible service, you never should talk to a customer like that! Over prices scrappy clothes as well.
4	Like a forever 21 but better! They have just about everything in this sure! You name it, they got it. Clothes,  shoes, jewelry, bags, and accessories! & might I also mention that everything is such a good deal?! I came up on a pair of summer sandals for only $13.99! Now,  thats a deal!
2	Worst customer service, bitchy chics who didn't even glance at my daughter and I when we went in, and we were the only customers. No hello, let me know if you need help, not even a freaking smile. The clothes are ok, definitely not the kind you wash then dry, hang them if you want to wear more then once. Honestly just tired of the stuck up entitled chics that work in clothing stores and act like they are annoyed your even there. When I was a teen I worked at Charlotte Russe and treated customers like I was actually there to help. Get over yourselves ladies, it's a retail job.
