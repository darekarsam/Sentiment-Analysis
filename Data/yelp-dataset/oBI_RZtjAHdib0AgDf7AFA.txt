5	Simon (owner) is a fair and honest business person.  SMK is my first call if I have an electrical issue.
5	I have known Simon for a few years and have always referred him to anyone that I know that needed electrical work.  This time we needed him on our personal home.  I wanted the old can lights replaced with recessed lights in the kitchen and then added additional recessed lighting in the family room and formal living room..His attention to detail is awesome.  There was very little drywall damage, and what little there was he repaired and painted (we had the paint match from when we had painted the interior a few years ago).  Everything was cleaned up when he left and you really couldn't tell that he was ever there.  He has an assistant "Alex" who was very trustworthy and also very capable.  I would not hesitate to refer them in the future, it's hard to find good contractors in the Valley but they are one of the best.!
