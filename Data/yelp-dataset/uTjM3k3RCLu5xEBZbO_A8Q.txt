5	Great customer service. Elliot & (I believe it was) Jared or Jeremy helped us with a quote on a wrapped wing. They said $70 bucks.When it was ready to pick up, Elliot showed us around the shop. They squeezed us in today (10/28/14) when they were busy on projects for SEMA. We can't thank them both enough.They have a ton of sample cards to look at for colors.  The pearl white & black rose were probably my two favorites. There's a variety to choose from. I couldn't believe how many color samples there were.They take credit cards.  Check out their website. :)WWW.5150WRAPSLV.COM

5	5150 Wraps is a 5-star business. Some of Elliot's work, in particular a blue Mustang, was featured at SEMA 2014.I visited to get my roof wrapped in gloss black, in addition to a portion of my bumper in matte black. Elliot did a great job on both. I can appreciate his attention to detail, such as making sure to tuck/roll the vinyl underneath the windshield seals and weather strips.My car has a sunroof and a shark fin antenna, and he charges a little extra for both. But the price for the entire job was very reasonable. I highly recommend checking him out for your wrapping needs.
