5	Tiffany is fantastic!  I have been going to her for several years and I wouldn't even consider anyone else.  Her treatment room is comfortable and inviting - I never want to leave after getting a service.  The facials are awesome and the cupping helps with my fibromyalgia problems.
5	I cannot say enough wonderful things about this spa and Tiffany!  She has a warm and welcoming attitude and the spa atmosphere is airy and inviting, relaxing and very clean and fresh.  Her services are to die for and she makes sure you leave satisfied with her work.  She is very knowledgeable about skin products and recommends according to your needs.   I have been going to her for over 6 years and I would not go to anyone else.
5	I have see Tiffany several times for a shoulder and back waxing and was very impressed all across the board. She has a nice private salon with a great location and had a personality that was extremely comfortable and welcoming. I've returned and will continue to return because it is a much better value and convenience than other places I've experienced.  I would highly recommended Tiffany to anyone in the east valley looking for an aesthetician or waxing of any kind.
5	Tiffany is an artist, your face will love it
