2	This location is about a year old and last year they had amazing employees...just last Friday I came in and two guys just talked to each other the whole time.  No hello or anything.  He just went through the motions...it was quite bad.  Love my new boots!!
4	Im giving them one more shot. The employees are nice and helpful. They offer you popcorn. And it doesn't get any better with the prices especially when one pair is half off. They have lots of wide width sizes in men and women's.
4	My feet Love Sketchers!! However to get the shoes that love my feet I have to pay more. Yes they have sales, which are great for the most part if there is only you. But buying for a family does get pricey. I have always been able to get assistance, the employees are great and know their shoes. If you walk run or exercise these are the shoes for your feet.
3	Located on the East Side in a shopping center off of Nellis Blvd this Skechers store is a no-frills establishment.The floors are concrete and the walls are lined with shoes. Every square inch of this place is shoes - at least you have a large selection.I am not sure if the prices are on-par with what an "outlet" should be. I have a suspicion they just put the "outlet" in the name to lure in customers.My mother and I specifically came here because she wanted to buy a pair of their memory-foam shoes so she could have something sporty-looking to slip on and off with no laces.We found the shoes no problem and I got a pair too (they were having a buy one get one 50% off sale). I haven't worn Skechers since I was in 7th grade, but honestly these shoes are nice for slipping on and running out the door for groceries or taking the dog for a walk.I would have never come here had it not been for my mother. Service is lackluster, they only have a few employees working at a time and they all have to man the cash registers. Overall - A-OK.
