5	We needed to have our 75 gallon water heater replaced in a hurry.  The water heater was leaking, and the shut off valve was defective so I couldn't stop the leaking water. I called a lot of companies late on a Saturday afternoon, and most either couldn't make it until Sunday or Monday or refused to give a price quote over the phone.  Alex answered the phone, asked me all the relevant questions about accessibility of the water heater, quoted me a price and said he could be over in an hour.He showed up on time and did a thorough and professional job.  He had a great sense of humor throughout dealing with this heavy project, and cleaned up thoroughly when he was done.  I'll use him for all future plumbing needs.
5	I found Alexander's Plumbing through Yelp reviews and couldn't be happier. He originally came out for a few small items but ended helping us install plumbing for our bathroom remodel. He is thorough and makes sure the job gets done right. I would definetly recommend his services.
