5	I had a Great experience with this U-haul.  Picked up a 26' truck at 9:15 am Sunday and was out the door within 15 minutes.  Both Representatives were smiling and incredibly friendly.  They were busy but both helped customers very quickly.  My truck was clean and ran great.
5	I just rented a trailer from this location, and my experience was absolutely great! Sebastian helped me get an adapter for the wiring harness of my vehicle, rented a receiver hitch and trailer to me, got it hooked up, all in twenty minutes. Upon my return, the gentleman who was there had me unhooked in 5 minutes, receipt on its way to my email inbox. Trailer was clean and worked great! Highly recommend!
2	Dropped my truck off to have a 7 pin wire harrness and a brake assist control. Put in. I was called a couple hours later saying my truck was finished. I went to pick my truck up. As I was leaving I found that my power windows did not work. So I stopped and let mike the person who had taken care of me. know my windows was not working. He looked it over and found that I had a electronic ignition fuse blown. So he replaced it. That fixed the.problem. for a little bit as I drove about 1/4th a mile the fuse blew again. So I went back to uhaul and asked him to figure it out. In left my truck with mike. So he could fix the problem. A couple hours later mike called me and said he could not figure out what was wrong. And stated he was not a auto electrician.  And that I would have to file a claim with uhaul. And find someone who knew auto electrical.  To get it fixed. So I took my truck home with no power windows and my truck alarm would not shut off. The next morning I took my truck to a different uhaul. And suprising the uhaul tech fixed my truck. And showed me the big mistake mike did to my truck.now my truck is temporally fixed thank to george at uhaul in mesa. I can go get a estimate on what the cost or repairs is going to be. So I can file a claim with uhaul for the expense.
