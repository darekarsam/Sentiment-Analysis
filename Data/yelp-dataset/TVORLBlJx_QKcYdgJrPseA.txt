5	This Cafe is in the Department of Environment Building in the Capital area of down town.  They have a hot entree, sandwich board, soups, salads (& a salad bar), snacks, & breakfast foods.  They are open Monday -Friday 6:30 am til 2:00pm.  They also have an outdoor patio when the weather gets nicer. Food is good and the staff friendly and efficient.  One of those secret inexpensive places to eat.
5	Cafe 1010 is one of the best breakfast spots in Phoenix.  I highly recommend getting the pancakes- they are delicious!  Also, if you are on the go this is a great place to grab breakfast as take-out.  They have great service here!
5	Juan and Emilio are the best! Fantastic breakfast, made to order and very affordable. Been coming here for almost 4 years!!!
5	Cafe 1010 is one of the best kept secrets in the area --- I'll tell you about if you promise not to go blabbing to everyone. Deal?Tucked away in the government building district, there's easy garage parking (free! shhh!) --- inside the Cafe is a grill that does everything from burgers to turkey reubens (Juan is a grill ninja master. Ask for crispy fries.) --- daily specials like fish & chips or baked ziti or taco salad or filet mignon (I may have made the last one up) --- I have not been here for breakfast but the regulars swear by the breakfast burrito.Another pro tip: don't tell Emilio, the affable owner (and frequent cashier) --- but his prices are trapped in 1999. Very, very affordable. Convenience store prices. I also like, as a diet soda person, that the fountain drinks include Diet Coke (bah humbug!) but also Coke Zero (getting better) and Diet Dr. Pepper (is this aspartame heaven?) Plus there's coffee and iced tea and juice and --- OK, enough reading. Go to Cafe 1010. Don't tell your friends. Our little secret. Deal?
