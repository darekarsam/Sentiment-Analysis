4	Not too bad of an experience, but you will be treated like your getting on a plane before entering.I understand that security in government offices is a good idea and that some peoples entire incomes and citizenship may ride on these employees decisions, but a full on TSA vibe walking in seems like a little much.That said, the whole place is ran rather smoothly.  Nothing like the DMV, most of the people are smiling and are actually helpful.  Not a place you need to go very often, but unless your getting deported or something, it shouldn't be treated with the same dreaded "Do I really have to go deal with these people", like most intercity DMV offices.
1	2 hours here and still waiting. Whats worse- now everyone has to stand in line for past hour. The only location in Charlotte and so understaffed. I am honestly wondering where our taxes go. No way to speed process online, since I refuse to mail my passport! Three windows serving hundreds of people. And one of them closed! The other window has a guy with giant long dread locks. I cant have a job with hair like that, so why USA office allows Bob Marley as they best face forward? No priority for mothers, handicap. I can honestly say I am disappointed and this office sucks.
3	Don't let their opening time of 9am fool you! I got here at 9am, and the place was already filled up! Get here before 9 to get a better spot in line.Security people are nice... Hopefully the desk agents are too. We will see... 55 mins waiting, but I'm nearing the front of the line :-)
1	The website says they are open until 3:30 but they close at 3:00!
