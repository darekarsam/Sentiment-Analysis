1	Gross absolutely  gross.  We ordered oysters , fish burrito , Carne asada burrito , and popcorn shrimp. I will say this the oysters were huge but after eating the other items I refrained from eating all the oysters but managed to try 2 not that bad.  I was more scared to eat the rest of the oysters  after tasting the hard Carne and dry rice in my burritos.  Will not be going back.
3	Ok so I grew up on the east coast where whole in the wall, mom and pop restaurants are a staple and always the best kind of find. But I'm not going to lie, out here on the west coast bad experiences have made me skeptical. However I give credit where credit is due and I feel like it is appropriate to give to this place. Now let's be realistic first... the under water decor is atrocious, the music is "authentic" which usually isn't my cup of tea, and the waitress didn't speak much english but hey, how much is needed when you can point to a menu? However, if you are looking for a huge burrito for under 6 bucks that is packed with flavor this is your place! I come here when I want to get stuffed! I have many a time made the mistake of coming here on my lunch break and then wanting to nap in my car. The salsa that is served with complimentary chips is also homemade, fresh, and delicious! There is also a plethora of sauces available to adorn your dish, and to a girl who likes her condiment choices that is right up my alley! Couldnt give more stars just because I haven't tried more menu items but I would recommend.
