3	Clean, comfortable and everything you'd expect of a Best Western even here in Germany.  From the outside the building doesn't exactly ooze curb appeal, but it does boast a decently appointed lobby and a spacious outdoor patio lounge connected to their rather quaint-looking bar.The hotel sits near the city center and is surrounded by commercial and industrial properties.  This place is an oasis in the heart of a somewhat dicey area, especially at night.The furnishings in the rooms are current and amenities ample.  The staff is friendly and is able to communicate in English.
1	Not a 4 star hotel as described on Hotwire.  Smelled terrible. The staff was lost when it came to reservations.  The cleanliness was not to speak of.  I will not ever step foot in this hotel again.  Save yourself the struggle and book somewhere else.
