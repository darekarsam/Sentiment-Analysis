3	I go here because its near where I live and I am Catholic.It's not a church I can see myself being very involved in and the place has an "old school" feel to it along with the congregation, which seems to be shrinking with every passing year.The pastor is a good man. I like his sermons which are sometimes a tad dull and can seem "canned".Good variety of mass times on Sunday, good sized parking lot and casual dress is the norm being some of the better points of this church.
3	If you are looking for a charismatic Catholic church in Greenfield, this is not the one.  Of course I was going to mass to praise God, but I couldn't help thinking that in my old church, people weren't normally scared of each other.The woman I sat beside acted as if I had leprosy.  May have been a personal problem - I don't know, but I didn't feel much at home.However, it is conveniently located.
4	Awesome fish fry and street fair.
