4	Really like this car wash. Always clean facilities. Good water pressure. Vacuum went for a long time (able to vacuum my SUV thoroughly, including the back). Even an automatic car wash on location.
1	No card option, just coins.  Two of the stalls were inoperable (coins jammed and stuck into slots).
5	The best do it yourself car wash in the northwest part of the valley with ease.  For ever .25 cents you get 40 seconds, most other places I've been to you only get 30 seconds for every .25 cents.  Plus their pressure washer is super powerful and not to mention the soap brush gives out plenty of suds where others do not put out nearly as much.  If you live in the area and are looking for a good place to wash your vehicle I would recommend this place.
2	Searched up places to get a fun car wash. This was the closest one on the map. This was my first time going to a more classic car wash.Didn't know where to go, or how to place my car. No sign of what each hub or room or place or whatever were so I just placed my car in one of the stalls in the front. There were signs on the wall on how to use the car wash but they were all faded out and hard to see. The equipment and soap were bad. After the car wash I still have dirt and grit. The foam brush didn't take out what my fingers can pick up on my car.You can pay by quarters or card. Bear in my mind your money goes by quickly. It goes by the time even though sometimes the equipment is just idle.Tried the vacuum in the back area. What a disappointment. The suction was terrible.Will not go to this car wash again. I was thinking about Fabulous Freddy's while I was using this one.
5	Love this place. The wash never disappoints. The vacuums always work perfectly. I keep returning.
