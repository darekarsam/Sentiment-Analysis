4	The Gyro is very good. The owner says that she uses 100% lamb and the Tzatziki sauce she makes using both Greek Yogurt and a small amount of sour cream, to thicken it up as the cucumber is moist, is really good. I have to say that it is very good and the whole experience was one of my favorites. It would be well worth the visit for either the sandwich, which I had today, or the platter which I have had at a previous visit. The lamb is so tender and flavorfull. Must try. There is a large selection of other items to choose from that I have yet to try ranging from Cajun Classics to the more regular American fare. If the other items are consistent with the Gyro then I am sure they will also be very pleasurable to the palate.
5	Very nice atmosphere, cute and friendly waitress, good prices and good food that's different from the usual fare that Indian trail offers. Enjoyed the chicken creole on a bed of rice. My son said his steak sub was very tasty as well. Overall I recommend Sam's Grill if you're looking for something other than pizza or burgers.
