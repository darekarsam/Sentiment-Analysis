3	I would give this place 5 stars if they had a dryer. They have a no-touch drive-through car wash that costs $5-8 and it's great and makes the inside of your car smell like shampoo. But, it leaves you soaking wet.So bring your towels! Or if you're feeling extra productive and energetic, you can hand wash your car here too
3	When the owner is not around, a good place. But when he's in, the worst place to wash your car. It's as if, he don't want customers to be on his property. Constantly asking annoying questions, and thinking that you'll break his stuff. So avoid before 5pm on weekdays.
