5	My favorite panini place in Montreal. Located where I grew up in St-Leonard in the East end you can find a small panini place where you can make custom choices to some amazing sandwiches. To your heart's content. Try Marco's Special or Frankie's Favorites and you'll come back here for sure. Its a nice cozy place, big enough to allow small groups to come and share their thoughts on these unique sandwiches.The owner is friendly and attentive and loves to talk with his clients. (He loves the Blackhawks!)The coffee, particularly the cappuccino is fantastic. Many choices of drink can be bought as well.Protip : Ask for a side order of their "famous" spicy mayo.
5	This is hands down the best place in Montreal to get a gourmet panini. As if the sandwiches themselves weren't good enough, you also have the wonderful company of Marco himself most of the time.The only downside of this place is that I can't be there more often.Get yourself a "Charlie's Chicken". Fresh chicken (not that grill-mark-painted garbage that passes for food in other joints), bacon, Dijon, and that special mayo. The most important ingredient though is LOVE! That's what makes the difference.Damn it I'm hungry now.
5	Milano's...MOVE OVER! Da Marco is THE go-to place if you want a real delicious Italian panini. I ordered the Marco's special and my sister ordered Pino's Prosciutto and both were amazing! The staff was friendly and courteous. They made me feel welcome the moment I walked through the door. The service was quick and efficient. If you're looking for a fast grab n' go option this place will meet your needs. Hit this place up if you're in the east end. I certainly can't wait to return.
