4	I signed up at this gym about five weeks ago, and honestly, I've gone almost every day of the week to work out or do hot yoga. That's a miracle, for me! I really enjoy this gym, probably for a few reasons:1. The people who work there are SUPER friendly, open and welcoming, especially the director - she's so nice, always smiling and laughing. 2. Extremely affordable! I got the couples membership, which is only $44 a month, plus hot yoga for a limited time special of only $10 a month, meaning I only pay $54/month for full gym access every day of the week, as many hot yoga classes as I want (and they have relaxation and athletic hot yoga classes), plus access to any of the other classes they offer. Seriously good deal. 3. Lots of options for weight training, resistance training and cardio - they are a brand new facility, so everything is clean, bright and the machines are top knotch. Going to the gym is a really rewarding experience here. I'd recommend you go sign up ASAP, but then again, I don't want my favourite gym getting too crowded, so... it's terrible! Run the other way! Hahah. I'd give five stars, but I'm spoiled when it comes to hot yoga - Energie Cardio's hot yoga studio is definitely nice, but not as posh as Enso, and not as hot. I could stand to sweat a little harder! Still, the instructors are all *very* nice and I love the classes.
