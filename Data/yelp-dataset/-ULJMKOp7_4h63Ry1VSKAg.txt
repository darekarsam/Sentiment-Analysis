2	Ended up here after being unable to find the place we were looking for, so already disappointed. I got a veggie wrap for $4.99--average, and a order of fries for $2.99. Fries were good, but a smaller serving that you would expect for $3. Nice flat screens along the walls. Basic bar food at slightly above average prices. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.
4	Decent enough pizza.  Prompt service.  Good pizza lunch deal.  It looks like some tough reviews for this place, but honestly they didn't seem bad at all when i stopped in.  Way more seating than some of the other pizza places on Mill.  Way less grimy/grungy than the other pizza joints too.  The guy working behind the counter even offered to swap out my soda for a to-go cup when I paid my bill.  I'll certainly give them another shot.
4	Good pizza and prompt friendly service.  Staff was attentive and my waiter made sure we were happy. They even changed the channel so we could watch a game.
1	DISGUSTING!, RAW PIZZA!, NO HEALTH FOOD STANDARDS!, ABSOLUTELY FILTHY!     I live near Mill Ave and this place is the only place open after 2am.  Every time I've been there the food and service has gotten worse and worse. I thought the first time maybe they just didn't cook the pizza long enough but it's been soggy and so floppy every time I've tried it that you couldn't even pick up a slice without all the toppings falling off! The pizza dough was RAW! The meat they used tasted like it had been left out overnight and over cooked in a microwave. Last time i went in late at night and got FOOD POISONING from some mediocre chicken wings. The same night i noticed all the pizza they leave sitting out, under NO protection and NO heat lamps is the same gross pizza they use to REHEAT for customers. I went by for drinks one Friday night and saw them reheat the same pizza for customers that had already been sitting out for 4 WHOLE HOURS!!!DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND NEVER GO INSIDE THIS ESTABLISHMENT!!!
