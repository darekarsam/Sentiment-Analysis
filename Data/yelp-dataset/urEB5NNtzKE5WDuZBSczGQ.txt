5	I absolutely love this barn! The facilities are nice and well taken care of, and the horses are well cared for. I have been boarding my horse here for a while and could not be happier! The people are nice and the trainers are great. I'm so glad I found this place:)
5	Hunter's Edge is top notch.  Great people and a family-friendly, no drama environment!  The well-being of the horses always comes first in all of my observations and the horses here receive top notch care.  It is a safe and non-judgemental place to learn, equally conducive to both children, junior, and adult riders.  It is also a competitive show barn with a team of dedicated riders who compete regularly.  Judge for yourself!  Take a tour, meet the riders, and get to know the staff.
5	Great facility that treats riders and horses with the utmost care and respect. Emphasis on jumping, but still an excellent center for riders of all levels. Attention to safety is paramount. Very competitive pricing with great discounts for packages or homeschooling! Highly recommend this facility and its' professional staff.
