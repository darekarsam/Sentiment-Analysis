4	This is a pretty typical CVS location. Conveniently located for me to pick up the random prescription or health & beauty item. Those are typically the only things I come here for. The staff is usually pretty friendly and their pharmacy is efficient. They have a drive thru drop off and pick up for prescriptions, but I have never utilized that service. I've never had to wait long for help and the lines at the register are never too long. It's a nice place to shop for after holiday discounted candy and treats as well. Overall, a good CVS location.
3	This CVS has improved quite a bit over the last year.I get my prescriptions filled here every month, and for a while, they misplaced prescriptions, filled them incorrectly, or wouldn't text me when my prescription was ready.Over the last 3 months, there have been great improvements made in their customer service.  The pharmacists are polite, apologetic when there is an issue, even if it isn't their fault (my doctor sent the wrong prescription, and the pharmacist was amazing.)The store is always clean, and the employees are helpful.  I'm much more comfortable shopping and filling my prescriptions here than I was a while ago.
