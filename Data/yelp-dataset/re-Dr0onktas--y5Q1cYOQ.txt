5	AMAZING. I think that's the only word I can think of. This is so cool that FINALLY we have some kind of "oddities" type shop in Phoenix. I've been searching for one for a long time, and yes I was guilty of being into it after watching the show "Oddities". Mason, the shop owner (if not one of them, I'm unsure of that), is SO nice and friendly and I just want to keep throwing money at him. His stocks are pretty good for a new shop and they just keep updating. There's always something new to look at. If you haven't already, please check this place out! It's on 6th ST and Roosevelt, a few doors down from the Jimmy Johns. They are good people and it's always great to support local shops.
5	This is a gem of a shop in Phoenix... I recommend stoping by and seeing this awesome shop that offers cool items with great customer service.  This is a must see for a locals or a tourist of Phoenix.  This is only 15 minutes from the airport and centrally located no matter what direction you are heading.
