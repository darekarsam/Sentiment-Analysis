3	Typical Starbucks located in ASU Tempe campus's Memorial Union. They do not serve the toasted breakfast sandwiches and don't accept certain Starbucks incentives/coupons. Hours may vary with semester breaks and MU building closures.
1	A typical Starbucks but STAY AWAY from all Starbucks on campus. For some reason they have the WORST service..
5	The blonde guy who works there is SO cute. Happy baristas and quick service (which is surprising considering it is one of the busiest in the nation)!
1	They've been out of vanilla roobois tea for three weeks now. Who does inventory? Stevie Wonder? Also there's also 6+ employees, 4 who just stand and talk and it takes an average of 5+ minutes for a drink. Most inefficient Starbucks I've been to.
