5	Choosing a physician can be a very daunting task. Even more daunting when the patient is leaving town in 4 days to return to college. I cannot say enough about the courtesy, professionalism, and attention to detail that the staff at Dr. Yu's office demonstrated in regards to my daughter's injury. They are a reflection of Dr. Yu himself. He was caring and considerate in dealing with her concern. In addition, he understood the demands of distance running and the injuries that may result due to high mileage. The office itself is gorgeous and very easy to locate. We chose well.
5	Dr. McGee is an amazing doctor. His office staff made me feel welcome the moment I arrived. His assistant was kind and provided significant support during my x-rays. Dr. McGee not only had a warm personality, but he got me evaluated immediately. When I returned to his office he was extremely comprehensive with the explanation of my torn ACL while showing me the MRI images. His surgery scheduler Siana was sweet and very helpful. On the day of surgery I was extremely nervous, however he was reassuring and made me feel comfortable. He called to check on me after my surgery and my follow up visits were always informative keeping me abreast of my path to recovery. Dr. McGee always listened to me, made me feel like my concerns were valid, and answered any questions that I had. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND Dr. McGee!
5	I saw a total of four orthopedic surgeons and chose Dr. Joseph Yu. He saw things on my MRI that none of the other physicians or even the radiologist noticed. This was vital in determining what surgery would be best for me. He takes his time when he is with you and answers all your questions. He is a true physician that is not trying to up sell what is needed, unlike many surgeons I have encountered. Las Vegas is truly blessed to have this man offering orthopedic care to the community.
