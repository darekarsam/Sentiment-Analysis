5	Dr. Fihn is one of the few doctors left that spend time with patients, listens, examines thoroughly, and is interested in fixing the issues, not just prescribing medicine. The staff is super friendly too. On my first visit, he spent a good 30-45 minutes with me ensuring that he understood what was ailing me. I asked him how he was able to spend so much time with me when previous doctors spent at the most 5 minutes. His answer: "If I can't spend the time necessary to treat you, then I won't treat you. Maybe those doctors can sleep well at night practicing like that, but I know I can't." I have found a lifetime doctor.
3	Dr. fihn is a good doctor but I can no longer take the manner in switch his staff "Megan"  treats and talks to me. On several occasions I have called to refill a precipitations only to find that the staff haven't got around to asking the doctor and it always seems that it takes me calling back several times. And then to add insult to injury to be treated and talked to like I have been impatient. Even if I was impatient I am a paying customer! I am 50 and a very patient man and don't appreciate being talked to and treated in this manner. For this reason I am seeking a new primary physician. Hopefully Dr. Lieber staff will treat me better.
