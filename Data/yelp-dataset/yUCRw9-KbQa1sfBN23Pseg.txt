1	Is supposed to little bit harder to find specially at night it's on the east side of grand just east of that bridge.
2	This post office a little hard to find. It's just under the bridge.Not too many changes here the heavier set blonde seems to be really grouchy and aggravated all the time because they're really slow at this location I think they need a lot more help.
3	This is the post office that serves my business address.  When I need to go inside, even when the line is to the door, things normally go pretty fast.  I've never had a problem with grumpy employees.  I have seen some customers who have no clue what they want when it is their turn slow things down but that is not the fault of the Post Office.
5	Really nice people! Around the holidays there can be quite a long line, but that's to be expected. I've gone a few times this week and I've been in and out in less than 5 minutes!
5	Great service easy in and out. The postal services gem of a location just north of Maryland on 55th avenue. Had Robert help me who is deaf but an amazing lip reader. Will definitely use them again!
