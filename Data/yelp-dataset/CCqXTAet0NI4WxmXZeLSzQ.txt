3	Fun, relaxed place to see some comedy.  I came the other night to watch a comedy competition.  My pint was $7 so not a steal but it tasted good.  The room is small and they pack 'em in.  This is ok though as comedy is better when you've got a full house.  As soon as the show was over it seemed to clear out and people headed downstairs to Grumpy's for trivia night and cheaper beers.  Tomorrow night I'm going to check out an improv show.  Maybe I'll have an update for you
4	Ok so my update is actually based on about 10 minutes downstairs from Comedyworks at Jimbo's Pub.  Why?  Because they have $4 Jagermeister shooters!  I am always a fan of that.  Oh - plus I went to check out Improv A Go-Go upstairs.  $5 cover and tons of frickin' giggles. Improv rocks 'cause if they have a lame moment at least you know they weren't rehearsing it in their bathroom mirror for weeks prior so it's not awkward.  Here's their facebook link if you want updates.  http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5571646917
4	I saw SUCH a funny show! The staff was great, and the man seating us was incredibly kind. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because once you were upstairs, you were required to buy a (weak) drink, which i was disappointed in because you already had to pay 15 to get in. I went on a Saturday and I don't know if it's different on other nights, but I was slightly annoyed.
