5	Maggie's thrift supports Maggie's place. Maggie's place supports expectant single mothers and single mothers w newborns which need assistance and they are located in the Garfield neighborhood.   My family has been supporting Maggie's place w donations for about 7 or 8 years now.   Maggie's thrift is an excellent place to find a bargain and support a great cause. Got stuff you dont want to yard sale or are looking to donate?  Also a great spot - Inhabiting an old bungalow on McDowell, the thrift store is small and charming.   Go shopping and then hit a restaurant on 7th or 16 th street.  Sounds like the makings of a great weekend in and around the Coronado Historic District to me.
5	I stopped into Maggie's a few months ago on a whim. They had so much stuff in that small house - games, clothes, furniture, kitchen stuff, decor... I loved it! I found some great fabric for $.50 to $2.00 for a lot of yardage. There were tons of clothes and even some vintage favorites too for really cheap! I got this great peacock feather maxi shirt for $4 and they had a dollar rack on their patio where I found a few things too! I also found some cute tops, my now favorite pajama pants, and some craft supplies. Definitely stopping in there again soon!
5	Great place for a great cause! Always have new and interesting items for super cheap! They even have deal days that certain items are discounted. I would say we go once a week just to check it out. I never find to many clothes options but for the rest of the house it's totally a great place!
