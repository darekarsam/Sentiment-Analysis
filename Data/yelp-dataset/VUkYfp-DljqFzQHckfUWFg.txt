5	Hands down this place has the BEST customer service. All the massage therapists are so professional and skilled. Front desk receptionist are ALL so sweet and considerate. You never feel forced buying anything or signing up. Instead the staff make syou feel wanted and special even if you are not a member. I highly recommend visiting this place and experience the amazing service and massages.
5	I went to redeem a gift card I was give for Christmas and got one of the best massages ever. The appearance if the spa over all was clean and organized. I felt warmly greeted by the front desk. My therapist, Jacob was informative and very friendly. I felt very satisfied and eager to come back again.
5	Been coming here for over a year. Place is wonderful, staff is polite and courteous every time I come in. Massages are well worth the price and I have a membership that I love even more than the gym. Definitely check it out
5	Best facial at a great price and my skin wasn't damaged afterward as it was at salon 51
