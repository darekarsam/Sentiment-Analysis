5	Great guys and great cars!  Nick has some of the best prices on hybrids around and he paid the taxes even! Who does that?  We looked at several of his prius' and had a hard time choosing as he had almost every color.  All services where up to date and our car is still going strong and sipping gas! Thanks Nick and Greg!  I won't hesitate to refer you to my family and friends.
5	Great place. Selection, customer service, ease of buying and especially price. There's no better place to buy a used Prius --private dealer or otherwise--in the Valley. Nick and Greg have it down and I mean that in a good way. Very pleased with the Prius I bought there and the price was more than fair. All prices are out-the-door too. No hidden fees.
