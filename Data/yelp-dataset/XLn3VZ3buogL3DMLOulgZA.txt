3	The space is gorgeous and the aerial silks class I was able to attend was awesomely fun... but the management is less than tactful or helpful about scheduling and it has really soured me on the whole experience.
5	This place has been around the corner from me for well over a year - in fact, I've bought many a soy latte at the starbucks right next door - but I've never set foot inside.  It took a Living Social deal and my lingering, unfulfilled desire to try wrapping myself up in silks to bring me there (of course, I knew I would look less like this: http://youtu.be/By-A7AN4jEA and more like this: http://youtu.be/b1Xpe-xSeyM but it was worth a try).This is a great class for a beginner - it's small, the silks are relatively low to the ground, and the teachers were top notch - Sarah and Jen were kind, supportive, clear, and always happy to help with personal corrections and suggestions.  Besides which it's a beautiful space - and there was at one point a ballet class, and then a salsa class, going on right alongside us, so it felt like a fun, community atmosphere.  Maybe I'll come back for the ballroom dancing!And that silk work is a full body workout, let me tell you - my arms are stiff and sore today, but so is my core.  Good stuff, and highly recommended.
