3	4 stars for the food, 2 stars for service. Really nicely done falafels - spiced just right and kept hot (not microwaved), for less than $3.However, the guy who made the wrap was grumpy and the guy who rang it up was a total jerk - he insisted I'd ordered a chicken shawarma and tried twice to charge me for one.
3	I ate here three times while I was in Montreal, and most of the days I didn't eat there, I was wishing I had! Truly, for the price, the food is hard to beat. The platters are around $10 and the sandwiches even less. Among other things, their red-cabbage and green salads stand out -- crispy and healthy with flavorful Middle Eastern seasonings. The "tout garni" falafel wrap comes with creamy garlic sauce, briny pickled turnips, grilled vegetables and tahini. The shwarma platter might be my favorite -- fresh salads alongside buttery rice pilaf and tender-crispy shards of beef from the giant rotating shawarma behind the counter. Great, now I'm getting hungry just remembering it.The staff there is wonderful: friendly, helpful and willing to speak French to a novice. Major points in my book. I wish the atmosphere inside was a little nicer, but on a beautiful summer day I would rather head for the park anyhow!
3	tiny place located next to a stripclub and next to the university obviously that serves middle eastern fast food.price is cheap, portions are decent to huge. it'll fill you up nicely. service is fast enough despite the lineup (which tends to go outside) during lunch hour because students are hungry.love their potatoes with garlic mayo and the shawarma and i always try to get a side of pickled turnips. its like pickles, can't get enough of them!don't expect the world. enjoy it for what it is, middle eastern north american fast food
