5	The honey cake is soo good. It's moist, sweet and buttery, and you get a bright hit from the apricot glaze on top. A lot of their other pastries looked just as good.I also tried the peach hand pie, as recommended by a woman working there, but I wasn't so crazy about it. The dough didn't have much flavor and the peaches tasted pretty predictable.  Despite the peach pie, I'm giving it 5 stars because the honey cake was so good and I can't wait to try more of their creations.
5	My honey was turning 60 yesterday so I decided to track down his favorite slice of cake... Tres Leches cake, which we have eaten a few times at Alchemy. The cake is unique, fairly light and not overly sweet. It is a Mexican favorite. I called and left a message for Mary. She returned my call promptly and was very helpful. On birthday afternoon, Mary delivered the cake right to my door. The attendees of the birthday soiree and of course, the birthday boy,  loved the cake. I ended up with more cake than I needed but I was able to drum up volunteers who were happy to take a few slices off my hands.  Unfortunately two of my friends have lactose related issues and were unable to enjoy this milky delight.This is one special cake baked by one special lady. Why bake when Mary can do it for you.  Enjoy!
