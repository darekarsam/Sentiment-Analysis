5	Love this place! Whether just updating the same style or going for something new, Tammy always knows what to do...even when I don't. She's fabulous with color, too! Changes me up without putting me over the edge. Everyone in the salon is great; they make it a great place to go and relax and git yer purty on :)
1	I called to setup an appt today and was put on hold, okay I can hold but 9 min later come on! I hang up call right back and they help right away to setup my appt she was very efficient making me an appt with her bad attitude I say thank you and goodbye and all I hear is a phone hanging up SMH I'm only going because I have a gift card I hope when I go in I don't get more of this poor service
5	Love this place. Its nothing fancy but they do a great job for a decent price. I used to go to a very high end Salon in Portland before i moved here and this place is better and half the cost.I was seeing a new stylist for the first time- Stephanie. She was absolutely fantastic! I was looking for a specific hair color/look and she nailed it! My expectations were exceeded! Thank you! I will be back
