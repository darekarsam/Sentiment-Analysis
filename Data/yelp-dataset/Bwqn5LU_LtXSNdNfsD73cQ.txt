1	Action Painters may be good painters, but they are also telemarketers who call people that do not want to be called.  I'm on the Do Not Call list yet these folks call.  I would not call a telemarketer for painting - ever.
1	Received a call from this company while on the National Do Not Call registry. Makes me think they don't know much about business practices if they are doing this regularly. After getting a call today and seeing the complaint from January, I guess they either don't know or don't care about rules.
1	I agree completely with the other reviews. Not sure how good they are at painting, but they excel at constantly bombarding me with telemarketing calls. And the calls come from what looks like a private line with a person's name on it, to trick you into answering. Forget this place!
