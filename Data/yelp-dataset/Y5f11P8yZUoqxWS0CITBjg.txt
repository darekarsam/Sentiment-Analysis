4	This repair shop is great.  They take the time to thoroughly explain everything in terms that you can understand.  They don't do unnecessary work.  I thought I needed brakes and they checked them out and said they were in good shape.  Their prices are reasonable and they have the work done when promised.
5	Very friendly and knowledgable!  These guy are very good at what they do. Car trouble is never fun and seldom inexpensive.  I found that they look for ways to save me money and explain in detail what the various charges are for; bringing meaning and value to an unexpected expense.  Obviously anyone would appreaciate this level of service, and this is why i award them 5 Stars!!I will definitely return.
