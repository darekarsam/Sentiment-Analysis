4	This is our new favorite local bar. They have completely remodeled the inside and it has a really nice, fun atmosphere. They serve a great and reasonable breakfast and make really good burgers. They have some decent specials and game time fun as well. I've never done it but they have "naughty bingo" every few months. The owner is a nice lady named Debbie and she often tends bar. We watched a the badger game last weekend and they served Jell-O shots with every touchdown. They seem to have regulars who are friendly as well. If you are driving down hwy 51, I'd recommend stopping in.
4	This is a great little bar in McFarland. Wonderful atmosphere and amazing "Hot Bottom" Bloody Mary.
