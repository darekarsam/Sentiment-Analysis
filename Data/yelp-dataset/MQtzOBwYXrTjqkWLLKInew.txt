3	The "Ideal" dive bar... although the front room, with its grizzled clientele, was a bit sketchy, we found the back porch to be the perfect size for our large-ish group to lay claim to.
5	If you are into being hip, head to Mickey's. This is a bar for men and women who work for a living (not that type of work social workers and academics do, but they are just as welcome). The bartenders are great (and often includes an owner). The beer taps have a nice selection, the price is lower than the more trendy bars of the area. It is an old school Wisconsin bar with a lot of charm, but little pretension.
3	The drink glasses are huge and they actually make a good drink.  The juke box is awesome.  One pool table with some video poker.  Some of the best sweet and salty bar snacks in the neighborhood.  They also have a free Thanksgiving and Christmas feast.  It is the only bar in the neighborhood that will stay open until two as long as there is one person there...
4	Another strictly pinball review. Around thanksgiving the Ideal was had Simpsons Pinball Party. SPP is a lot of fun but never lasts long at any one stop in Madison (first played it at the Plaza this past summer) because it always has mechanical issues going on. Stopped in the other night to find Walking Dead (which you can also find at the Up North currently). I haven't seen a lick of the TV series, Walking Dead so I admit I'm missing something but this game was just plain boring in my book. 4 stars for having a functioning (and new!) pinball machine - I bet Walking Dead fans will feel differently than I do about this one.
