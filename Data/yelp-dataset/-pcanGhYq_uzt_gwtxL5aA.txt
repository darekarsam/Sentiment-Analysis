5	Best chiropractor! I have been coming here for years and have always had great service. Appointments are recommended but he'll squeeze you in if he can. The receptionist is always pretty polite and helpful. I always walk away from his office feeling great and refreshed!
5	I am lucky that I have been a patient of Doctor Penna's since 1994.  He not only treated myself, he treated my mother with COPD(may she rest in peace), my sister, her kids, and hundreds of friends.  I have been recommending him for years.  He treats you better than family,  He has opened up his office on an emergency basis when I was involved in a car accident.  To say he is a friend or family is an understatement.  I drive from Anthem Highlands to his office in Summerlin.  I won't trust anyone else.  He takes damn near every type of insurance, and took cash payments when I had no insurance and was in a pickle so to speak.  You can walk in and wait or make an appointment.  I am more than satisfied with Roger as my chiropractor after 18 years and get the best treatment available!
5	Dr.  Penna by far is the best chiropractor I have ever seen here in Vegas. I've been seeing him over a year now and I can guarantee that you'll be just as much as a satisfied patient as I am
5	A few years ago I went to Vegas for a week long vacation while receiving Chiropractic treatment for an injury sustained in a car accident. My Chiropractor back home sent me to Dr. Penna (They went to school together). He is very personable and he made my appointment a fun experience. I asked him if he ever gets patients who fart when he pushes on their backs. He said "ALL THE TIME!". The receptionist and the people in the lobby heard us and cracked up. If I ever move to Vegas I'm going to this guy. He is awesome.
