5	This is for the McDs inside the Palms Food Lobby. 50 Chicken Nuggets for 10 dollars. That's all you need to know. Six Stars.
3	I had only eaten at 1 McD previously in my life but Zak R got me to try the hash browns here and I have to admit they are delicious. Cinnamon buns were no Cinnabuns but surprisingly fluffy and yummy.
1	bleh-bad mcdonalds food.slow service.and never get orders right. ever.
1	Just left here. Screwed up my order 3 times. When I was the only customer there and then giving me attitude because I kept returning with wrong items. You work at McDonald's. You punch a button and you read the screen . Yet you still manage to screw up a b-fast sand which lol.. 3 times. The art of fast food baffles me. Totally makes me lose hope in humanity. We actually left threw the McDonald out and  went to Burger King and they screwed up there too but just once... Still hungry.
1	Nasty ass restaurant. Burnt ass chicken nuggets and the dumbasses working didn't want to give me new ones.
4	Yes, this is a McDonald's...Yes, McDonald's hasn't been all that ever since they got rid of their Angus Deluxe and Premium Chicken sandwiches... I've tried the Quarter Pounder...no mayo, no cheese... and it's just not the same. Although, the food here is better than at any other McDonald's location that I've tried.But it's not the food that gives this location four stars. During the summer months, it turns into a sobering up/hook up spot for drunk, half naked, female, Ditch Fridays patrons... It's the best eye candy you'll find at a Micky D's.
