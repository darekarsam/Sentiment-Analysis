4	Surprised to read the negative reviews. I've been here twice and, while it is very "old school" (which I actually like), the service was fine, the work was excellent, and the price was completely fair.
1	Very unprofessional and rude !!!The quality of their tailoring service is poor to say the least, they will quote you a price and when you pick up your merchandise they demand a higher price than what was originally agreed to...
