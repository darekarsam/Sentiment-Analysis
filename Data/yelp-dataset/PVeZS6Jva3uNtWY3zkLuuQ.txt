5	My friend likes to say that a store like this is what women experience in a Prada store. Clean well laid out, high end woodworking tools and woods. They also have a shop to help process your projects with the tools you lack. I find myself going here more now that I found it.
5	This is like a candy store for carpenters......wow, so much wood! And TONS of exotic woods! I'm not a wood worker, but my husband dabbles in projects....he was practically salivating! Even for me, it was fun! They had some really beautiful woods like purple heart and zebra wood, mahogany, mesquite (and other domestics) lots of woods from Africa....If this was a hobby for me, I think this would be the jackpot!They do have a shop in the back where you can recieve some assistance on your projects, and they do sell a few tools, though I would think the main purpose in coming here would be for their variety of wood.
5	I am extremely impressed with this place.  Greg and Larry greeted me as I walked in and asked if they could help me find anything.  I let them know I was just stopping by from out of town and new to woodworking.  They showed me around the shop and I could tell it wasn't just a job to them.  They were passionate about woodworking and of sharing their knowledge with me.  Like others have said, the shop has a huge selection of wood and the prices seemed really good.  I'll definitely stop in again next time I'm in the area.
