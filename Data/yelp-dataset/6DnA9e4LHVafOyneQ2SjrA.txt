4	My husband and I stumbled into this hidden gem recently and were amazed at the quality of the food... This is a place located inside the Christown Mall... There is a big selection on "botanas" snacks such as corn, spiced fruit, rasados, tacos and seafood and Agua frescas. Typically  a bit hesitant to try seafood at mom and pop shops, but this place has nice cleanliness feel to it and you can taste it in the quality of their food. They also have Mexican candy galore!
5	Had the carne and shrimp tacos, absolutely fantastic!! Get them with the red salsa to add a little kick! Stop by if you are in the area you won't be disappointed!
5	Great quality food!  The shrimp tacos are amazing!  Delicious salsa & the best ceviche in town.  Kind of hidden in Cristown mall but if you're in the area I highly recommend stopping by for a quick delicious bite!
