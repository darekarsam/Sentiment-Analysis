5	Great bakery, wonderful atmosphere!  Try the Croque Monsieur for lunch, the poached eggs for breakfast, or the $3 special of the day ( coffee and pastry) anytime. Outdoor tables in the summer are lovely. Service is good but can be slow - take your time here!
5	I went to Montreal to visit my sister who lives 2 blocks from this place, which is the only reason we ended up going there. I may be wrong but it doesn't seem like a neighborhood you would normally visit as a tourist, so you may not have a reason to really try this place. But if you are around, I highly recommend stopping by!They have a pretty good selection of cheese, meat and sandwiches to go but their pastries and bread are excellent (just like in France!)Their sit-down lunch menu is also great and very reasonable priced (5 or 6 bucks for a delicious sandwich + salad!). Table service is nice and friendly but you service at the counter for to-go orders is a bit chaotic.All in all a great stop if you're in the neighborhood.
