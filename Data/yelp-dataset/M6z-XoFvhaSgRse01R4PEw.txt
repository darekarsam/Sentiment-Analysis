4	"Yay! I'm a fan," says the woman in her 30s...buying a skateboard and all the fixin's for my nephew. This place has a great location and has a skate park next door. They do everything from selling you everything you need to start skateboarding to fixing your board to keep you going. Once you purchase your products, they will customize and do all the mechanical tool stuff to make it work. Even though I look far from the skateboarding world, the employees were friendly and helpful as my nephew and I were figuring out what would be best. Very good experience.
