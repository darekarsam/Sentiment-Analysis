1	Renters, stay away from this company. We are responsible homeowners for years but relocated to Vegas so we first rented for a year before buying. We kept the rental place spotless, move out earlier than lease (while paying full rent + deposit). We were billed over $800 for cleaning/painting. We took excellent care of the house and provided them with professional carpet cleaning receipt at checkout. They even sent us to collection for not paying their ridiculous painting and cleaning bill. Also, no matter what, they had a $75 "co-pay" on their lease so renter has to pay regardless when you want them send a handyman to the house. (We found out later that other management companies in vegas won't do that to renters as we later own Vegas rental properties)Make sure you got all pictures taken and video taped at checkout. They always refused to have their agent to walk through the property at the end of your lease. Again, don't walk, RUN AWAY from dishonest Judy team at Asset Realty and management.
1	I contacted this company about a property I was interested in renting and no one contacted me back. I was told by the receptionist, who was very polite, that she would transfer me to an agent. I got a recording every time I called and left voice mails every time. I must have called 6 times and had my husband call. No one returned my calls. I emailed them through the "contact us" form on their website and still no response. Their voice mail and website say they will contact you within 24 hours. Clearly, that is a lie. If I can't get a call back about becoming a renter, how can I be sure they'd return maintenance calls...?
