5	Eat at mariscos and be merryachiThere's nothing that goes together better for me like peanut butter and jelly than seafood and mariachi, so I had to really try this place.We started with a dozen of raw oysters, fresh, juicy and intensively delicious, we also ordered the mariscada, a platter with a generous amount of seafood items to share and also the botana mixta equally served generously and they where both out of this land! Buckets of beer are half price from Monday through Thursday  and shrimp cocktails 2 for one during those same days. All I had to say was " thank God Is Monday!" Mariachi was a no show but that didn't stop us from listening to some corridos from the never tiring juke box, I believe mariachi is only on weekends as most places are but 12.00 corona buckets and a music machine was enough merryachi for me.Service Is great  place is clean and prices are awesome.Ok there's something else that goes better together......gin and tonic, but for the morning after hangover I got you on my list Mariscos el mariachi.
1	horrible service if your not drinking beer we were regulars because of the 2for 1 shrimp cocktail they were ok defenetly  not made to order my husband tried the 7 mares and got a horrible diareah and stomach ache everything was ok then they finally got they're license to sell beer  and they were the main priority! we were waiting for our order for over an hour we would see everyone get served but us even ppl for takeout my husband asked the rude owner and she said they had a lot of orders for take out i guess they come first than customers sitting and waiting for over an hour of course they're was a table of a family drinking and of course everything was rushed to them we finally got tired and told my husband lets go he paid for the waters we had and the horrible rude ass OWNER dint even apologize or acknowledge we were leaving never again the food is not made to order everything is fake not fresh not worth the wait and the bad service ur cocktails can be 3 for 1 u still cudnt pay me to come back
