2	I feel bad even writing this review given how nice the host was, but alas, I have had a lot better. After living in Vancouver for years and having easy access to awesome, authentic and cheap Indian food, I think that I know the difference between great vs. mediocre Indian food. I had quite possibly THE world's biggest craving for some saag paneer and my 45 minute walk from the office was made happier with thoughts of tucking into my take out bag of goodness.The host here is amazing: sweet, nice and ever so helpful. The restaurant itself is your typical Indian restaurant and it smelled good and is literally across the street from the Laurier Metro; super convenient. Perhaps it is because I ordered my food to go, I don't know, but it was watery, lacking spice and was just plain 'meh. Maybe they gave me 'white girl spice' or sped up the cooking time as I looked ravenous/about to chew my own arm off...I dunno. I will go back and actually eat in the restaurant to give them another chance, but my first impression is that of: this place is nothing special.
1	Same comment as Janine. Very nice host but that's all. Pretty disappointing food, bland taste. 2 dishes, 1 rice, 1 nan, 45$ (incl. Tax and tips). Not worth it at all!
4	I had this place for delivery and we ordered the butter chicken, naan, palao rice, onion badgi, samosa and lamb bhuna. Everything was very good. I've ordered from 6 or 7 indian restaurants in Montreal, and this is the best I've tried so far. Will order from here again. The butter chicken was velvety and the lamb bhuna was flavorful. Also the dessert was fresh and not made a week ago.
