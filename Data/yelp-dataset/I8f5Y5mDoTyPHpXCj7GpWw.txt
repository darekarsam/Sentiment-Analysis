5	We went here today for our first studio family portrait. Priscilla, the photographer, was great and she made sure the kids looked great in the pictures. The kids had fun with her. Bridgett, the salesperson, was really nice and helpful as well. She explained things clearly for us when we were picking out our pictures and package. Overall it was a pleasant experience today!
4	Not to expensive awesome deals and great pictures.  Bridgette rocks.  She did our engagement pictures and they came out so good.  She convinced us to bring out 7 month old. We came back a week later and she was so patient with him. Especially since these were his first professional pictures since he was first born.  We received a great deal and we got our pictures archive for 2 years with the Target portrait card and free sitting fees. We will be back next month for family pictures. Check out Groupon before you purchase pictures.
5	Not sure of her name, but on 7/24, I took my newborn in & this very young woman, did an incredible job. She took amazing photos. I came before with my son, the photos were good, but not want I wanted even tho I said multiple times what I wanted, but that was another woman. But this young lady from Thursday... Thank you. You have a gift. To be a teen, her patience was great & very professional. Keep up the good work!
1	Wow...what a ridiculous experience. This studio called me twice to confirm and to make sure I get there early. My appointment was for 10. And I didn't get out of there till 11:30. The shoot itself took like 15 minutes. I wouldn't even mind the wait but no apology or discount was offered. Not very great customer service.
