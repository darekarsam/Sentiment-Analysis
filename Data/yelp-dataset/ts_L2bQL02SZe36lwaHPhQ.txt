1	This is one of the bigger and less crowded stores that I've been to, but the customer service is by far the worst. Nobody greets you when you walk in; they just stare at you wondering who the hell you are. Employees don't even do anything. They're either busy talking to each other or on their phones. Also, in Canada, the markup on clothing is  ridiculous. A dress that I could have bought in the US for $35 (without tax) turns out to be $44 in Canada in addition to the 15% tax. Overpriced much?
