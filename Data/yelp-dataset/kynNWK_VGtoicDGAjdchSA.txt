5	Get a great cut and VIP service here from 2 of the best barbers in town.  You gotta check them out!!!
5	The professionalism is bar none! Always a positive vibe and great atmosphere. I have had my hair cut by both barbers and they have done excellent work to my hair. They accept credit and debit cards and you can either make an appointment or walk in. I refuse to go anywhere else for a cut, they have inherited a lifelong customer
