4	My wife like this place, the prices are reasonable, her favorite nails tech is Henry, he always do a good job, it really hard to find a good nails tech +1 for Henry.
5	Bessie is the BEST! I love this place. I'm always happy with my results!!!!!!!! My hair always turns out exactly how I want it, cut and color. The people are friendly, I am always able to get an appointment even at the last minute. I can't rave enough about this place. But instead of reading my review any longer, pick up the phone and make an appointment with Bessie! She's one of the best in the business:)
5	Hair by Deana French will be an experience I know you will not forget. Her hair is short, she is sassy and she does know what she's doing. She does that very well on your hair. Give it a try, she's an expert at hair. It's the best thing she knows how to do.
4	Mimi gives wonderful facials. Even though I had a Groupon, she gave me a wonderful treatment starting with the microderm abrasion, which isn't the most comfortable experience but it does remove the dead cells. That was followed by a more relaxing facial. I paid extra for extractions but it was worth it. It's not a fancy spa but it is a good value.
5	Teri Hastings has been doing my hair for ten years, ever since I moved to Vegas.  She's the only hairdresser who knows how to tame this mess on my head.  She's fast, efficient and talented! And a wonderful person to boot!
