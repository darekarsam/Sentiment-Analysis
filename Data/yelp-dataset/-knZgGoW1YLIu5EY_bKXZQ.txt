5	My son has been taking guitar lessons at Rokk Skoool for about a year and a half now and he just loves it. He shown great improvement and now that he's taking the Rokk Band class, he really enjoys learning new songs and performing them. Eric does a great job with the students. You can tell he love's teaching. I definitely recommend Rokk Skoool!
5	Wow - a rare (for me) 5 star review on Yelp.  My son has been taking guitar lessons at Rokk Skoool for over a year now and I have to say I am thoroughly pleased with his progress and with Rokk Skoool in general.  The Guitar 101 classes were 12 weeks and got him off to a good start and I could see steady progress from week to week.  Now he is in a Rokk Band and performs live every few weeks or so.  I don't know of any other music instruction system that will give a beginning musician that kind of experience at any price.Rokk Skoool is a group instruction system that, to be honest, I was a bit skeptical about initially.  But as time progressed I began to see the value in this method. Now that he is in a Rokk Band he practices weekly with his band learning new songs.  I never imagined that my son, now 11 YO, would be performing live in such a short time.  Eric (the owner/instructor) is a talented musician and capable instructor and it shows just how much he cares about his students.  I can think of no better start for your budding Rock Star to get started.
5	One of the great concert halls. Rokk Skoool is humblingly beautiful. The audience sits one three to four sides of the hall, and can not only hear every section of the orchestra, it can hear everyone in the audience. This makes for a shared experience at a concert that's thrilling.
