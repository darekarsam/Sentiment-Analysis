4	As usual, I left it far too late to book my appointment and so I couldn't get in at the Charlie Miller in Harvey Nicks where I've been going for years. I'd never been to the Frederick Street branch, and I have to admit I was a bit nervous about letting a total stranger loose on my hair.I shouldn't have worried. From the moment I walked in everyone was really friendly and welcoming, and even though I'd arrived early the stylist saw me almost straight away.All the usual trimmings were there - the complimentary refreshments, the AMAZING head massage when my conditioner was being applied and the top-quality products that they use. But why not 5 stars? The stylist caught my ear with her comb a few too many times for my liking. But that was honestly the only thing I can find to gripe about; everything else was perfect.
