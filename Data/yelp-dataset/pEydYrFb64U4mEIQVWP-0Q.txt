5	I have been bringing my 1 year old wild and crazy dog here since they opened...I have ALWAYS been THRILLED at how ALL the staff handles her, making her behave and have manners while pairing her with others that can play and have fun together...I have boarded her 2 times and she comes to play 1 time a week every week...I LOVE THIS PLACE and truly feel that THEY LOVE  my crazy baby girl...
5	The pups at CBW love their friends, the indoor outdoor space, the Best balls to play with, and the pup pools for warm days!! Then when they can get a bath they dont come home smelling funky.
5	Camp Bow Wow is by far the best place to board your fur babies. We discovered them through the rescue organization we got our Dane from and immediately loved their facility. The dogs are not kept in a kennel or run all day, they are in a play area with other campers where they have inside and outside access. There are also pools for the warmer days. They also have someone in each area with the dogs for supervision. The best part is they have Camper Cams, so I can log in and see my puppies throughout the day....awesome and addictive :). They will also give your dog a kong treat at bed time...what great caring. They also offer grooming and if you dog needs alone time, there is a luxury suite that is very quiets and you can use the camper cam 24 hours to watch your fur baby sleep. The staff is extremely friendly and I just keep going on. Defiantely 5 stars!!!!!
5	My dog loves camp bow wow. When I pick him up he's happy and worn out. The staff is super friendly and seem to care about their dogs.
