4	Kind a pricey compared to the near by food lion but way better produce, beer, meat selection, and quality.
3	Very clean, large selection of foods, mini-carts available, abundant amount of express check-out registers and virtually empty in the mornings. They also have a huge organic produce selection. Note* - if you are driving east bound on East Blvd (making a left into HT Parking Lot), be prepared to wait a little while during rush hour. It can be a nightmare trying to turn in. You might be better taking a different way so that you can make a right into the parking lot.
