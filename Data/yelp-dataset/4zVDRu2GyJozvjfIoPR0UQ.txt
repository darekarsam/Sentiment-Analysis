1	PLEASE beware of this business.   My first visit I was offered a month to month plan that I could cancel at anytime.  When I called to cancel the manager was argumentative and refused to cancel and would not give me the number of Corp. Most professional companies value their customers and would encourage contacting Corp. I give this place an F.
2	How hard is it to pick up a phone? I called to speak with the manager 2 weeks ago about canceling my membership. I was told that she was busy but would return my call. I called again the following day with the same excuse and no call. Following my third failed attempt I sent an email and again no response. The massage service has been fair but the management is very poor. Don't allow yourself to be placed in their monthly debit program. Shame on you Massage Heights for treating your clients with so little respect or responsiveness.
