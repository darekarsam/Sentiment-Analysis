1	Worst case of food poising EVER.  Probably the cheese on my pizza.  The only good thing is I lost 7 pounds in 3 days.
2	Even through the dining decor is a relic from the 80s the food is ehhh eatable and if your this part of the woods its good to know that this is the ONLY place open late . Ready your french that's all they speak here.
