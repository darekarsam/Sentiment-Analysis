5	Mike, you ROCK!Our backyard looks like a million bucks! We are extremely happy that we went with Southwest Greens for our backyard project. We got a play are for kids and my putting / chipping area for me. Mike went above and beyond. The project kicked off a little late, but that was a mistake on our part. I mean I'm still speechless at our backyard. We even had one of our neighbors come by and say, "yup Southwest Greens it is for me". I mean their customer service, warranty, and products are hands down the best in all of Phoenix area. Yes, it is a bit pricey, but like I always say, "you get what you pay for". Don't cut corner on hiring someone who just does 'fake' grass because of the price. It was jaw dropping when we walked outside and saw our backyard. My wife asked where our next vacation was going to be and I told her our backyard! She didn't like that too much, but it is true. Our backyard is amazing! Thanks Southwest Greens and Mike for doing a phenomenal job. If I could give 6 stars I would!!!

5	Just moved into a new home this summer.  Old home had a SW Greens putting green complete with T Box and sand trap we hated to leave behind.  Well, we called SW Greens and Scott came out and designed a better putting green than in the old home.  We love it.  Great knowledgeable design followed up by an excellent installation team.  These guys do a first rate job and they are competitively priced.Thanks SW Greens for our great new putting green!
