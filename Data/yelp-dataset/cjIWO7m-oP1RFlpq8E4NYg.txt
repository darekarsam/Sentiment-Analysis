3	PROS:1. The food is delicious, authentic Korean. All the stews come with a bibimbap. So you will not leave hungry!2. It's a small place which looks family owned. Staff are friendly and quick.CONS:1. The decor is pretty confusing. It looks like you're inside an Irish pub hosting a birthday party.  2. Ban-chan (small side dishes) are NOT provided as they customarily are with Korean food. Which I found surprising and disappointing since that never happens in Korea.OVERALL:-I'd say Chez Bong and 5000 ans are tied as my best Korean places downtown. If you don't care for little side dishes, go to 5000 ans. But if you want a true Korean dining experience go to Chez Bong. -I'd recommend the Pork Bone Soup (spicy!) miam!!
3	It was ok, at Seoul Chako the meat is fresher. The pancake and bibimbap is better at Lee Bong Nim.
3	The menu touts meat, however, both the meat dishes I ordered were....a bit lacking on the protein front. It smells great though. The place is small, but the ordering process is fast. The wait staff can be a tad slow (five minutes to get a coke), but they are relatively nice.
