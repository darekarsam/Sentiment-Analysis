5	A competitor of mine, but also a great business. Lessors offers great Printer support and affordable rates. They must be alright if their competitor gives em a 4 star rating!
5	Lessor's has been a Casa Grande fixture since 1988  and still provide great service.I fix computers but Lessor's is were I take my own computer when i can't do it myself.
1	Overpriced and 2 weeks later i call to find out where my computer is and they say "It's on the bench , just finishing up" twice this happened. $149 quote at lessors and $75 at another place and they called in one day.
