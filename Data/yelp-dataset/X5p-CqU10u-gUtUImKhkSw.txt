5	I'm not a guy who normally gets his meat from a butcher, to be quite honest.  I have in the past, but not anymore than going to your local grocery store.  This shop has changed my opinion on that, and I plan on coming for more!  Possibly the best meat I've taken home to cook myself that I've found in the Pittsburgh area to date.Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.
5	There are not enough good things for me to say about the quality of the meat and the staff at this establishment. We have been coming here for around a month now and I can't imagine buying my meat from anywhere else. We were looking for a special cut that is native to South America and when they got a half a steer in they cut it special for us and called to let us know when it was ready. They also cut meat to order if they have it available and you are looking for something specific. Every item that I have made from there has been phenomenal.  The people who work there are amazing as well. Very accomodating and helpful and really love what they do.
5	They sure know their meats. It's refreshing to ask for advice when buying a steak and the people are inquisitive and knowledgeable while being friendly.  I took the advice given and made a steak dinner that both my girlfriend and I thought was better than any we've ever had at Ruth Chris, Hyde Park, or Capital Grill. Oh yeah, the smoked turkey is out of this world.
5	Service was top notch, the staff was friendly, respectful and knowledgeable. I just moved to the area and will def be using these guys as my butcher, from now on. You want meats this is your place. Picked up some chicken livers which were priced very reasonable, and some bison. Why you ask? Three words; lean and exotic. O, they also got great jerky.
