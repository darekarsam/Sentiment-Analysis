5	It was very intimidating to start exercising at an age where  most people are giving up (late 60's).  Angela is fabulous, patient, knowledgeable and so encouraging.I have been going for nearly 2 months and can see and feel positive changes.  Don't  judge them for being bodybuilders, Roger and Angela understand regular people fitness and will shape you up!
5	Roger and Angela are great personal trainers.  Despite having only worked with Roger for a few months, I can definitely see the results.
5	I first signed up with Angela in January 2011, and to my surprise I still work out with her today. Angela is able to balance being able to motivate and push me without becoming irritating. I love that my workouts always have variety, so I never get bored with it. After all this time I call her my trainer and my friend.
