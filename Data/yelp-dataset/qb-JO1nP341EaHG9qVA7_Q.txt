1	contacting the health inspector about this place!!!! I went in an hour before they closed hoping to just get a box of California rolls (sushi) to go... I seen what was already made and the avocado was brown. This didn't look too healthy so I figured it had been sitting out for a while. I kindly asked the man behind the counter to please make me a new roll as the ones that were there didn't look very good. He agreed but when I watched him open the container the avocado was in, the whole container was bad. That is a food safety violation. You cannot serve someone completely brown avocado, It means its been sitting out for too long and the air exposure has caused it to soil making it have a sour taste and smell. I told him that avocado didn't look too well either, he continued to put it in the sushi roll cutting eyes at me. I then asked if there anyway that he could cut a new one, He rudely said no this all we have. So i told him no thank you! I asked the lady at the front desk to speak to a manager, she pointed over to the rude guy attempting to serve me soiled food and said he is the manager. Well thank you but you will no longer receive any business from me or my associates. It makes me sick that he is so cheap he will be willing to serve people bad food just to get his moneys worth. Compromising peoples health is no way of conducting business. And I will make sure that he feels the wrath of this angry customer.
2	This use to be my favorite buffet but they dropped the price and dropped the quality of the food apparently. Rice was way undercooked. Sesame chicken was kind of sloppy looking and sushi had a sour taste. Not to even mention that the place is super unsanitary. Bathrooms are beyond gross.
