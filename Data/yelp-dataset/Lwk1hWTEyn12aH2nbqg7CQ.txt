3	The owner of Lambi is one of the people behind the inspiring Nuits D'Afriques festival. Like a lot of spaces Lambi seems perpetually low on capital and unable to be all it dreams of being, but it doesn't stop them from throwing killer shows with great sound. Honestly parts of the system look held together by duct tape, but it's a second floor room in a heritage building with soul at a bouncing corner of St Laurent. The house technician works at his own speed but if you go with it you'll generally get some warm glorious sound. It's about 250 capacity, only open for shows or parties, semi-chaotic but always always with huge heart and high hopes.

It's a little hard to find as the "Club" is upstairs, with no easily visible signage at the street. It honestly looked closed.I would definitely go back to check out another act. As someone else mentioned in one of their reviews, there's not a lot in terms of liquor selection at the bar. But if you just want a beer while you listen to some music, there's no problems.

But one thing that was shockingly terrible was the sound!? There are no noise gates or compressors or anything through the monitors so it just becomes one big fuzz. I left 3/4 of the way through because it wasn't very enjoyable, though others didn't seem to mind.Not sure if it was just that one show, or everytime in the place. And usually I don't care, il motore is my favorite venue in Montreal, and sound is not good at all. But this was really bad and so muddy that it was making everything in the room reverberate and buzz.
