5	Tom and Tammy did a very great job cleaning my nails. This place is clean and there's a personalized feeling in this salon,  it's like going to a friend to have your nails done!
4	Ok. Let's see. I got the white tip with gel & I'm pretty happy! If you want something simple with no designs or have time for the frills then I def recommend this place. However I was a little put off from the cleanliness & dated decor, but the work done by Tom is Great. My nails weren't too thick and they look natural for sure. From my time here, looked like they service the older crowd mostly which is why I'm assuming they don't have design options or many colors. Pretty basic colors so again if you need a simple nail look and prefer quality over being rushed & pushed to add on services then I recommend this spot. I'm pretty sure I'll be back, thank you to my MIL!
5	We walked in 20 min before closing on Sunday and asked for an appointment for Monday. They asked if we had time today. They did a full mani/pedi and stayed an extra hour to finish my wife's nails. My wife has found a new regular place close to home!
