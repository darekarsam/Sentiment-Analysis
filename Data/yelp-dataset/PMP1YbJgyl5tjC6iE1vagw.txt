5	Candy, candy, everywhere! What more can you ask for? This is more than a candy store that has almost every candy you could dream of, they supply sweet confections for events and more. The staff is helpful and happy (wouldn't you be happy if your job was to work in a CANDY STORE??) Recent renovations made a great place even better. My teeth hurt just thinking about it.When you feel your sweet tooth yelling, just go. Just don't bring your dentist.
4	dream come true in candy land! I could not believe that I havent eaten all these new goodies! you acutally fo feel like a kid in a candy store!
