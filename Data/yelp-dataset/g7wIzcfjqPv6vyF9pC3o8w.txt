4	The food was great, the service was great... Everything was excellent. The whole family recommends it!
5	Okay, a nice restaurant in Stallings?  With a bar?  And a patio with a tv? And cornhole? And great food at a decent price?  I didn't think it was possible but Gearhart's Casual Eats proved me wrong.  Way to go!  You will be seeing more of me.
4	Excellent food. We both got the potatoe chip encrusted pork chop, with homemade applesauce, and bacon macaroni and cheese. The food is the most important aspect of a restaurant's offerings and they did a great job. The building is not the most beautiful, but is perfect for the price. Exactly as advertised, great service and great food.
