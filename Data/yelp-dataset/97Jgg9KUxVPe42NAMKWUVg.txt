3	This is definitely not one of the nicer 7-11 stores I've been to or the most organized or the cleanest or the fastest.  As a matter of fact its probably the slowest place around and the lines are usually really long. But the people who work there are super friendly. Their attitude and welcoming demeanor make up for the other not so great features.
