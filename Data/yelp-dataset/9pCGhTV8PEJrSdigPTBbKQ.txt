5	Great place to get your phone repaired or buy accessories for your phone! Everyone is friendly and knows what they are talking about.
3	I drive past this place all the time and in my head, I constantly make fun of the name. It makes zero sense whatsoever. And yet, it's catchy, and as soon as my iPad charger stopped working, I'll admit- it's the first place that came to mind.I called to verify they had chargers before I left. Got a bit frustrated when trying to pull into their lot from the Jones side during rush hour, since their lot does not seem to connect with others in the plaza, but eventually I made it in.Was helped by a young-ish pregnant lady who was super friendly and polite. She immediately took a look at the inside of my charger connector and assured me that I didn't need to buy the whole set, but instead just replace the cable- and they have an off-brand product that's $13 instead of Apple's outrageous $25.Was quickly in and out with less of a hit to my pocketbook than expected. Silly name, serious staff. The wacky name makes them memorable, I guess.
5	I was finally ready to switch my $100 V plan to a $30 plan.  Marco fixed my Iphone and 5 minutes later I was on my way.  Two days later I got a SW problem and again he directed me to the solution.These guys are sharp, helpful and just all around good guys.
1	If you need to get an iPhone or even an android phone repair, or sell don't go to these guys they'll rip you off!! I had an iPhone 5s that I had no use for so I tried to sell it to them, they where offering me $100 dollars for my phone that was in perfect condition. I went over to the Iphone doctor and got $300 for it.
5	This store rocks the one stop cell phone shop for all your needs.  They helped me unlock my phone and I didn't have to pay all this crazy money to attend no more! Good job wireless toyz
