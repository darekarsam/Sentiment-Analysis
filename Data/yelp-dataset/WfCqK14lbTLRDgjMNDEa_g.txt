3	Nice place to take kids if you can handle the crowd of other kids. Good family place.
4	Peter Piper Pizza is a kid's dream lunch or dinner destination and easy on a parent's wallet.  It's got a mediocre but good enough pizza buffet that's really reasonably priced and a big kid play area with video games and misc activities.  The staff there is mostly teenage kids but they're patient enough with the little ones.  I enjoyed my time here.  I wouldn't say it's the cleanest place but then, it's hard to be constantly cleaning up after billions of kids. hahaMight see you here!
4	Pretty good pizza actually--I'm shocked.  I used to take my daughter over to Chuck E. Cheese when we lived in the Bay Area and the pizza there was a friggin' joke.  This place has all the games and stuff that you would find at Chuck E. Cheese, but the pizza here is like ambrosia in comparison.Tasty sauce, substantial and good-tasting crust, fresh toppings--yes, here the pizza isn't an afterthought to the games, the tokens, and the ticket redemption area.  If it wasn't for all the kids running around and the noise, I'd probably come here more often and just order pizza.My daughter informed me after taking her to a classmate's birthday party here that she still prefers the pizza over at CEC's  Well, at least my wife and I can tuck into a nice pie while she plays games.  That and bottomless drinks--works for me.
4	Pizza is great here.  This location is typically clean and not too crazy.
4	I enjoy coming to this Peter Piper because it is never really crazy busyEven on the weekends, they do have a good amount of birthday parties but nothing too crazy The service is generally good here as the employees are nice and friendly The pizza is pretty good as well, I have always been a fan of Peter Piper Pizza Their games are a little dated but they seem to do the jobI have no complaints about this locationThe tables are clean, the floor is clean, and parking is easy
