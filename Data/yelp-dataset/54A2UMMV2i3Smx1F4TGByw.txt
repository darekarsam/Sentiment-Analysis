5	I wish I could give SIX STARS! I am relatively new to this remodeling thing, but long enough to know amazing service and quality. Here's the deal: Last Thursday, I read about Eco Friendly's glass pebbles (wow, made from recycled bottles, SO much better than plundering the world's resources for the sake of a shower floor!!). I called Friday morning and had the materials by Monday!! The best thing is that CEO Melissa answered the phone herself, answered all my questions, guided my decision, and shipped out the items that day. I purchased Surf Seaside, a gorgeous blend of pale sky blue and turquoise. The color is much richer than I saw online, and the style is charming. I am so happy to boast about this company! They have many many eco-friendly options. Best of all were the personal attention and expediency, so hard to find now-a-days. Can't wait to see the final product! Travertine-look shower walls, with glass / stone mosaic trim (a touch of that heavenly blue!), gorgeous 'sea glass' floor. AND the glass is absolutely hermetic. So no nasty mold. Definitely recommend!!!
5	I hired Melissa and company to install bamboo hardwood floors in my new home in Madison.  They did a really good job, were prompt and professional, and I think their price was fair.  They also have been available for floor care consultations.  This is a woman-owned, local, independent business that focuses on the use of sustainable materials.  I highly recommend them.
5	We used eco-friendly flooring to install cork flooring in our basement. The quality of the cork was excellent, they are easy to work with and schedule with. The price was fair and lower than other large flooring companies, and quality of work was excellent.
