4	Really fun candy store with all of the options, fudge, and ice cream.
3	I love a great candy store and I needed to find a giant lollipop for my Katy Perry halloween costume, so after doing a quick Yelp search, discovered that Sucre Bleu was the closest to my neighborhood.  Upon entering, it seemed promising! they had the lollipops in various ridiculously large sizes and all the regular gummy and chocolatey treats you'd find in any respectable candy store.  my only 2 complaints are that the lollipop was $9 (for the medium one, the large one that I really wanted was $13) and they charge a .25 cent fee to use the debit machine.  I am slightly beyond irritated when I am charged to use a debit machine (it's 2012, right??)
2	This is not an exciting candy store and the stock looks old. The self serve candy bins offer a decent variety and you'll find plenty of Jelly Belly beans if that's your thing, but I've seen way cooler and more fun candy shops.I was specifically looking for some giant gummy bears and they had only 1 left, which wasn't that giant at all and it looked like it had been sitting there forever.There's also a Bilboquet ice cream shop inside, with hard ice cream and sorbet to choose from but it looked messy and unappealing. Flavors are hard to read, scribbled on a chalk board. If you're looking for ice cream, there's a shop right across the street that will prove to be much more satisfying.
