5	I cooked the best pork roast ever tonight. Fantastic cut of meat. Thanks Adonis.
5	After a 5 hour Sunday drive from Toronto, we almost didn't make it before closing which I thought would be 6pm. Well it turns out they are open until 7 on Sundays.I wanted to barbecue some of their delicious Shish Taouk chicken breasts when we got to my dad's place. We also bought pita, tzatziki and fresh tabbouleh which is all prepared in-house. Anytime I visit back home, this is my go-to grocery store and well worth the trip.They've got an amazing selection of meats (including BBQ chicken), fresh fish and seafood, a wide assortment of international cheeses and awesome pastries.Service is probably not the friendliest, especially when they are super busy which they are often. Good luck finding parking on the weekends but we got here late so it wasn't too bad. Come here for the food!
4	In the simplest terms Adonis is a high end grocery store... But for foodies it's really SOOO much more. It's an emporium of awesome, a utopia of excellence, the pinnacle of perfection... It's food heaven.The experience starts when you walk in the door. Great lighting and a smart layout make shopping comfortable and inviting. Everything is fresh and well presented. There's truly something for everyone at Adonis.To I'm picking up the ingredients for an epic breakfast (ok it's just bacon and eggs but you shop at Adonis you feel like a hero...).
4	You'd never know this was an awesome grocery store, but it is. Besides the staples, they have middle eastern (and other) specialities done better than right. Baklava, shwarma/shish taouk counter, pies and bakery, and much much more. As others have said, their marinated meats are awesome and their dips and spreads are almost as good. Only con: need longer opening hours. Happy to have an Adonis near my house though. Got me to like olives that I avoided for over 20 years.
