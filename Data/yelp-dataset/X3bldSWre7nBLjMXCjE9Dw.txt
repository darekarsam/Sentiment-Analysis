4	If you are rushing from point A to point B, and find yourself at the intersection of 27th Ave and Camelback, this Jack In The Box will get your order right.  I've picked up many a Diet Coke here, plus the occasional lunch.Sometimes it's busy, but you can count on friendly service and accurate order fulfillment.
4	Stopped into this Jack in the Box for lunch today.

4	Felt like eating out, favorite burrito place was packed, mcdonalds breakfast was over at 11, so the closest place with fast breakfast I could think of was Jack.  I always regret eating fast food, but I have to say, the instant gratification lasted a little longer than usual, it was alright.  But as soon as it was over, I got that sick nausea fast food feeling, that's the norm with all fast food though, so not saying it was bad. Almost threw up, but it was worth it.
