4	Great service!!
4	took my nephew to get some Nike's that he wanted...I wish I could remember the name of the guy that helped us...he was super duper nice...anywho, they didn't have the shoe in store...so he tracked it down and ordered it for us with free shipping to my nephew's house. :)high five for great customer service guys! :)
1	How hard is it to be polite? If you don't like your job, why work here? Dude took his time ringing up the customer in front of us while there were 3 other customers in the back of us. We asked a question and got a loud  "what!!??!?!" in return. His arrogant face was threw me over the edge!
4	Although the store is a little cluttered always when you walk in, the last time I went I bought a snowboard for my boyfriend and the service was awesome! The guys were so nice and even with it being so busy during Christmas season, they ordered my board and it was the easiest process ever. I highly recommend this store for snowboarding gear!
1	Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service. Was yelled at, laughed at, an my questions were brushed away. Plus I bought a sweatshirt and it smelled bad out of the store so I went to return it the next day. They then told me they wouldn't swap it out because it smelled weird.. I was outraged and the "manager", a girl named Taylor, was extremely rude and did not handle the situation like a professional would. I don't know why they allow 16 year olds with no customer service skills whatsoever to become manager. I will NEVER shop at Zumiez again because of this experience.
