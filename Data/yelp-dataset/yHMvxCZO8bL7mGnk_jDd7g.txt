4	I was born in Buckie. For those of you not in the loop, that's 16 miles from Elgin. Thus, I feel a bit of a loyalty to the area, nothing much else happens up there!!Elgin cashmere is great, it's mainly supplied from Johnstons of Elgin, so you just know you're getting quality.The shop itself is located right in the middle of the Royal Mile, so hits all the tourists and has that appeal. The price is hefty, but the quality is good!!
3	You can tell from the fronting that Elgin Cashmere is the genuine article. It stocks high quality cashmere that sets it apart from its competitors (made in Elgin, as the name suggests). It's a great place to stop by if you're planning on getting something special to take home for a loved one.I did a double take when I saw Lady Di's face hanging above the door, however. I actually peered in disbelief for a bit. But my appalling eyesight does not deceive me - you can get her memorial tartan here. I don't know what I think of that venture and want to be tactful. I can, however, tell you a funny joke that I thought up whilst taking a Yelp picture for this establishment. If you want to hear it, drop me a line.Now that I've suggested it's funny, it's probably not even!
