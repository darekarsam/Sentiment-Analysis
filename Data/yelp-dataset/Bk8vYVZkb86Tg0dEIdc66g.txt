5	I buy my stuff  there all the time and everybody are super gentle! Maria and john in special!
1	this store used to be the bomb. it has a recent death blow though. it went from being corporate with very friendly staff and fair prices to a franchise store. prices hiked up. less friendly servive. the kid tonight was too busy looking at facetime on his phone to ask how i was doing or treat me like a human. alot of new rules. no more bathroom for the public. no more hot food on grill food after 10 pm. if i didn't live right next store i would not go back. ovoid this store at all costs!
2	Franchised location. Several times I've been turned down on normal seven eleven promotions or discounts. I don't even think it's that they don't give them, I really feel that it's a choice that the cashier makes. Kind of dumb. Instead of making a sale that has a discount (big deal) they get nothing from me.
1	This place is the worst of all the 7-Eleven. They don't help you at all. All the workers here use to be intergraded. Now they have only people that came from the middle eastern workers.They will take you last penny if you don't count your change and make sure you ask for a receipt to make sure you have the exact change. This place also put these ads on their window but most of the stuff that they have on ad doesn't exist in their store. They will try to see you what they have before they start to order their shipment.  It's really not cool to go to a store and they stare at you like your going to steal or something.   I feel that this store is to take all your money and some and cheat you out of your change. They will sometimes be closed for about 2 hours in the middle of the night and they don't have the courtesy to have a sign out to let you know that they are closed. You also can't refill other then 7-Eleven product cups or they will over charge you for the refill. If you want to be ripped off then this is the place for you.
