4	This Starbucks is located inside a grocery store (Smiths).  I'm giving them 4 stars just due to the convince and service.  Other than that, this is really one of those makeshift type Starbucks that you find at airports, books stores, and Idaho.  Don't expect everything that your regular Starbucks has like food, cake pops, hipsters on their laptops, etc.  Right at the entrance of this Smiths, you can't miss it.  My main reason for coming here is because the other Starbucks in the AM have lines longer than "It's a Small World".  Also always pleasant to see the same people at the same time almost everyday.  Really hated to write this review because I wanted to keep this one a secret.
3	Great service.
3	Not the best location, but its the closest. The staff seem very busy at all times. As long as they fail to follow the guidelines and recipes Starbucks provides, they can't get any worse than textbook service. I love my Americano in the morning,
