5	I have been using them for years! Wonderful work and great attention to detail.
5	I love Barbara Ann, she is a very funny and a nice honest person. She is the only one I trust to work on my alterations or dry cleaning. She does all the work along side her husband! They are both very honest nice people. I highly recommend Barbara Ann's to everyone that asks me if I know anyone who does dry cleaning and or alterations! I've never had to take back any of my clothes for her to fix up! She does such a great job! I will never use anyone else but these people!
1	I've been here a few times and each time, my alterations have taken longer than quoted and without notice, and the service I have gotten is more-or-less rude. I have also had things measured on me there ahead of time which still did not fit properly after being altered.
5	I'm really curious about these 1 star reviews.For example, why would one reviewer go "a few times" to a business where she was (a) treated rudely (b) made to wait longer than quoted and (c) the work isn't good?   And this other reviewer has a very vague critique...  If you're going to write a bad review,  being more specific would help other people.Barbara Ann's has been in business for decades.  DECADES.  Please take the bad reviews with a grain of salt.  Even if they're 100% true, you've got to know a business cannot stay open for that long if they really stink.  _____________________________________________________My reviewSince moving to Mesa about a year and a half ago I've gone to Barbara Ann's Alterations on 4 different occasions.  Never used the laundry services, just the repairs and such.  I've had a couple of long pants hemmed and then 2 pairs of blue jeans repaired (one of which was over 13 months ago and they're holding up perfectly) and most recently she is sewing some patches on something for us (dropped off 2 days ago and got a call that they're ready this afternoon - so I can only attest to the price and speed, though I have no doubt it's a fine job.)The repairs were all done even more quickly than I needed them.  For example, the patches (there are 15) were done in 2 days and she said "a few days."   The repairs have all been good, great even.  My favorite jeans ripped on the seam in the thigh area like a month after getting them.  I guess not well made... but they've hung in there just fine since August of 2013 when Barbara Ann repaired them.  Neither of the hems have ever come undone.  But I'll tell you what.  This is a nice lady.  I'm genuinely shocked that both of these reviewers say she was rude.  I don't know that she has anyone else that works there as the owner is the only one I've ever dealt with.  She's welcoming.  And chatty.  Every single time I've been there I always end up talking with her for a minimum of 5 minutes past when our business is done. Prices are markedly cheaper than any other tailor I've used.She speaks fluent English.  (I just thought I'd mention it,  For some it matters.)The alterations shop is very clean.Easy location and enough parking, though there's still road construction on     Southern that's eventually got to end, despite the fact that it seems like that    will never ever ever happen.
5	I needed a clean and pressed shirt for a presentation and brought it over to this dry cleaner. I brought it in in the early afternoon and needed it by 6 PM. Although I don't believe they offer same-day service, let alone few hours service,  they were completely accommodating and courteous.
