5	Johnny Burrito is the best burrito in Charlotte, BAR NONE.  This guy used to work at one of the Charlotte banking giants, and left to start his own restaurant because no one uptown made a burrito like he wanted. This is one of the most popular lunch places with the uptown bankers -- by noon the line stretches out the door, down the hall, past the florist to a soda shop that must be jealous of Johnny's business.  You can get regular or large burritos or salads, and your choice of meat (or not) and your choice of fresh toppings.  Do not be alarmed about the line: even from past the florist, you'll be in and out of Johnny Burrito in 15 minutes.  This guy knows how to make your burrito, and he knows how to move people.
5	Tasty, tasty burritos with super friendly service and a great soda selection. The grilled veggies are spot-on. Johnny is always around to make sure you are having a great experience.
5	I felt compelled to give this place 5 stars because there are a bunch of "reviewers" giving it lesser stars for the dumbest reason.  Sorry, they don't have shrimp burritos.  Sorry, this isn't a sit down resturant.  Its a take out place.  This doesn't take away from the fact that this place makes the best burritos I've ever had.  It is all fresh ingrediants.  It is a fantastic place for lunch.  BTW have a brain when you write a review on here.
5	I stopped in randomly for lunch the other day and it was great. there was a longer line but thought it must be worth it.  the line moved pretty fast due to the guy behind the register.  he moved the line along with speed and not at the expense of the customer.  funny guy.  the burrito was perfect and delicious.  I will visit Johnny Burrito often when i buy lunch in town.
3	I think of this place as more like Meh, OK instead of A-OKNeeded a quick lunch-grab to get back to a meeting so coworker suggested Johnny Burrito.  Initially thinking we'll never make it as I see the line out the door but boy, does it move fastCoworker had his usual chicken burrito & said it was the usual yumminess he expectsI had the veggie burrito & it was super bland.  It was absolutely ginormous & filling as all get out, but no real flavor.There's a huge assembly line of various beans, cheeses, veggies & other fillings you can include so at the end of the day, you've no one to blame for your combo-satisfaction but yourselfNo chips includedDon't forget to ask for LOTS of hot sauce
4	Fantastic Burrito! So much better than any of the other burrito places in Downtown (Uptown?) Charlotte. The line moves surprisingly fast and the service is great. Owner of the place was working the cash register and thanks you for coming in. Oh...Guacamole is included for free.
4	Wade through the Atrium at the Wachovia building and head down the escalator.  Hang a right and you will see the line for Johnny's Burritos.  Even after 1:00 on a Friday the line was still out the door.  However, the line moves quickly and at the end of the burrito building process you walk away with your own custom burrito (or salad).On my first visit Johnny started my veggie burrito order followed by 'regular size'?  After sizing up his customer.  He then went on to give me a cinnamon jaw breaker for Fireball Friday and explained that my take away bag would contain napkins and gum and that I should peel the foil and eat as I go.  After some encouragement that the first time was the hardest, I was on my way down the line.You can finish your meal in the heat/air conditioning of the atrium for some extra people watching or on a nice day sit outside in the court yard in the sun or shade.  You can't beat that with a yummy burrito stuffed just the way you like it.  At the very least, you have to envy this guy for his enthusiasm and creativity.
3	My boyfriend works uptown so I occasionally meet him for lunch, this time he chose Johnny Burritos.  They instantly could tell I was a newbie (I must have had a took of confusion)  They were super friendly and helpful.  I had the Chicken Verde burrito which was tasty but missing the kick you'd expect with a salsa verde. It's insanely fast and the regular isn't so huge that you can't reasonably finish it, it's not a behemoth like Chipotle's.  You can mix and match all kinds of ingredients to get the burrito you so crave. I think they also change up the base meats and they have a tamale friday special.  and as a plus, guac isn't extra!  It's a tad gimicky, they hand out fireball candies on fridays and you get chicket gum with every order and newbies get a bottle opener.  They also have a great selection of old school sodas and a sun drop slushie.
3	4 stars for the service, 2 stars for the taste.The big wasn't that big, it was normal size to me.  Lots of choices for one price, which was awesome.  6 different meats, lots of topping choices.  And yea, the service was really good.The taste?  Just not there.  The rice wasn't flavorful, the steak had a hint of flavor even though they were generous with it...I didn't put sour cream/cheese on there, but they are generally masking agents - what doesn't taste good with those 2 ingredients????
4	Felt compelled to write a quick review after having a phenomenal burrito here today. I've been going here for about three years and had some fine meals, but today was over the top. I usually get the regular size, but this time went for the big, along with the spicy chicken in green chile sauce. Since I was in a hurry, I just told them to load it with "everything". That included, rice, black beans, three kinds of salsa, cilantro, onions, sour cream, guac, chopped jalapenos, lettuce, and tomato - it was monstrously large! Still not sure how they wrapped it but they did. The taste was perfect - spicy, smooth, crunchy, warm. A lot of different flavors that together were a symphony in my mouth! Utterly and totally hit the spot. Added bonus - local place with local owners just putting out great product. Thumbs up Johnny B's!
5	You cannot do better than Johnny Burrito for good food, fast! Owner, Johnny Bitten, is a WONDERFUL man and his employees have been there for as long as I can recall and they always seem happy. He has a lot of choices and they are not skimpy with toppings. I only have one check in here--I need to get better about that--but I eat here several times a month and am quick to recommend it to anyone new in my office. The line might look long, but they are SUPER QUICK! You can take it upstairs to the seating either in the Atrium or outside by the fountains as there is no seating at the actual shop, which I consider a plus!
3	Johnny Burrito is A-Okay. Not great, not bad, just Okay. Logistics works like other burrito places. An assembly line of toppings.Order your meat or veggie, fillers, and sauces. Wrap it up, pack it, rub it down and grub.
4	I always forget about Johnny Burrito, its tucked away in the wachovia atrium building where its not front of mind. But when I do remember I am very excited to go there! The food here is pretty good. I usu sally get the salad (with chips and lettuce). They have very fresh ingredients to top your burritos and salads. It is a little more expensive than salsariats and qdoba but you get more food for your money and you are helping a small business by going here! The line looks so long but as others have said it's fast moving! It's another great place when you want to change it up with your lunch options!
3	Good burritos and fast service. Recent visits have brought forth burritos lacking the oomph of burritos past. The firecracker chicken poppin but not crackin, the hot salsa milder than it used to be. Still though, nothing so egregious as to take JB off my Uptown lunch list when I've got burreeter fever...
4	With being in the basement of the Watch-Ova-Ya/Hells-Fargone atrium, I feel like JB is the best unkept secret in Uptown Charlotte.  They have been around forever and a day as the yellowed newspaper articles smattered across the walls will tell you.  As will the "best burrito in Charlotte - 1999" award.  Nothing recently?The wait can be hit or miss to get grub from JB's, and if it is hit, you have a little of a wait.  I have seen it stretch almost back to the escalators before.The easiest thing is to get a regular (pronounced reg-OO-lar with a tinge of spanish accent).  The steak is nicely cooked and the chicken is good as well.  Their guac is muy chunky and not too shabby.  The rest of the ingredients run along burrito standards.You can either do one of the tasty cream sodas or birch/root beers or hit the fountain for washing down your meal.Its just a quick take out, allowing you to find seating upstairs, outside, or back at the office.  In and out in only a few minutes with a $7 regular that has knockoff chicklets in the bag to take care of post lunch breath.  Oh, and they offer beano at the register to take care of any other olfactory offense you might commit later on...
4	Not only do I love the food here, I'm impressed at Johnny's ability to compete with the big chains.  It's not uncommon for there to be a line out the door at this place during lunch time.  Varied meat choices, great toppings, local produce, and a great bang for the buck are just a few reasons to come here.  The grande burrito is massive, and a good deal for the price.  The regular sized is nothing to take lightly though.  Although Johnny doesn't provide as many toppings as Moe's, the quality and taste of the meat is comparable, if not better.  It's definitely better than Salsarita's and Qdoba in every way.  I do wish there was more of an effort to offer some more natural, organic, and whole grain options in the meat, toppings, and tortillas.  Chipotle and Moe's offer this, so if Johnny wants to make sure the new Moe's in the epicentre doesn't steal his business, he may need to adjust his ingredient options a little.But overall, I love this place and have it on a 1-2 times a month rotation.  I like supporting the small business owner, especially one that can offer a legitimate product that can compete.
4	I SO miss working downtown & enjoying the ever so delightful Johnny Burrito!Their burritos are so delicious...but it is filling. (c) Ron Burgandy.The regular size burrito is the way to go! Picadillo (spicy beef), lettuce, tomato, pico de gallo & cilantro is my weapon of choice.The chips are always fresh & have just the right amount of crunch, but again...you have to be pretty hungry to eat the burrito & chips!Mind you the space is small & there will be a line at lunchtime.  However, the line moves quickly as long as you know what you want prior to placing your order.  Think of it as a "Subway" or "Quiznos" type of order.I defintely put Johnny's up against Moe's, Qdoba, or Salsarita's. Not to mention, you're supporting a small business owner!
2	The owner is there everyday, which is cool.The prices are decent if u don't mind basically paying for a Rice/Bean Burrito with a dash of meat!!!!! (I don't want a bunch of filler, i want meat w/ filler..not Filler w/ meat)They have a special on Friday's but.. its no good for me because I doubt I'll try it again. (I've been here 3x)
4	This is the best burrito in Charlotte in my opinion.  I have been to Phat Burrito too and was unimpressed.  They have more meat selections than your typical Moe's, Chipotle, Qdoba, etc.  They load the burrito up with toppings and they don't charge extra for guac (YES!!).  The hot sauces they have are HOT and I love it!  It sucks this place is uptown or else I would be a regular.
3	I'm updating my review b/c I recieved a message from the owner. (Good Customer Serv.)its good to know owners care enough to reach out to patrons that use Yelp.I have not been back however, the message that I got from the owner is well worth the additional star. Plus, I've been told what/how to make my next visit more "BANG" for my buck. thanks again
4	There's some caveats to this 4 star review so let's air them out. I'm a californian and burritos are an incredibly vital part of my diet. Johnny burrito does not make burritos that would compare to any actual taquerias at home, or in charlotte for that matter.Still as a workday lunch that doesn't allow for a drive up N Tryon to to Plaza Midwood, Johnny Burrito can still hit the spot. The staff is also super nice and it's great they don't nickel and dime you for guac and the like. Authentic, no. Good workday lunch? Sure.
4	Friendly staff. The owner is always there, with a smile. My food is always good, and not overly priced. Note to manager, great job on trying to speak spanish, maybe work on your accent?!
5	My favorite lunch spot. Always some great meat selections, friendly staff... and of course, Johnny himself. It's not mexican cuisine, it's just a damn good burrito.
5	This is my go-to place for lunch when I work downtown.  I like to eat healthily for lunch so I don't feel like I'm in a food coma after, and they have many healthy options.  Also, you feel like you're walking into a friend's kitchen to grab lunch with the chatter going on. You get to pick all of your (probably 20 different ingredients) for your salad or burrito and... Bonus:  they have Twizzler Tuesday's, free chicklets (old school - love it!) etc. - that stuff cracks me up.  The ingredients you can build for your burrito, salad, etc. are fresh and delicious.  Love this place and everyone who works here!
4	Burritos are very good and they don't nickel & dime you on guacamole / queso or any other toppings. Great cherry lime sundrop slushies. Lines are long at lunch but move very fast. Owner takes care of the staff, they have been there forever and do an outstanding job.
4	"Regular por favor" has become a phrase we here often after moving into the Wells Fargo 2 building.  Johnny Burrito definitely does it right in terms of customer service, burritos, and style.  How many restaurants can move a line of 30 in 10 minutes?  I also like the fact that "You're the boss for the next 8 feet".  This place is amazing.  More or less, you determine the amount of toppings on your burrito.  Even the salads are filling if you prefer a healthier meal.  Free refills until close.
4	Good food, pretty hard to find.  We were visiting from out of state and felt like Mexican.  So I found this restaurant with an app and it took a while walking up and down the block before we realized it was inside another building.  Even then, you have to search for it as it is tucked away.Anyway, once we found it we were pleased with the choice.  The burritos get to be pretty big and filling and the salads (my wife had the salad) is also large.  The chicken had good flavor and just a hint of spice.  The overall price was very good for the amount of food you get.  There was a long line and I now understand why, good food for a good price.  Also, the sweet tea is delicious if you like it pretty sweet.
3	First of all, I love burritos. And anything that tastes authentic it's even better. Johnny's Burrito is always crowded. Line out the door, but there isn't really a large inside area anyways. Atmosphere is very eclectic and original. Option for your burrito are endless, all meats and add ons you could think of. the meat isn't anything to rave about, kind of bland. But their guacamole is pretty tasty. You can get everything on your burrito wrapped or in a box. However, with all the options available and on your burrito, the tortilla doesn't stay together. I would likely visit again as it's convenient downtown, but it wouldn't be my #1 on the list.
4	4 food. 5 service. Pork & Chicken: regular on wheatBlack olives, cilantro, sc, guac, cheese, hot salsa. Good, but sloppy to eat. It was a while back & it didn't stick out to me enough to remember more than that...
5	Friendly service, fresh and delicious food -- A truly local and consistently excellent establishment!
5	Great service, a nice alternative for lunches in uptown. The owner is so helpful and friendly, gives great suggestions for mixing and matching proteins or sauces. Place can get packed for lunch.
4	A little expensive but first class customer service and fresh veggies and food all the way around.  Very personalized and very fast.  This is hands down the best burrito place in Charlotte and I am a burrito aficionado.  Sorry, but Phat Burrito has nothing on this unique dining experience.
5	Best burrito in Charlotte.  Easily outclasses qdoba or chiptole.  Haberno salsa is perfect blend of heat & flavor.  Chic-let gum with every order.  Favorite lunch spot uptown Charlotte.
5	Amazing customer service !! the staffs are super friendly !They have 2 sizes of burritos,regular or large and you can choose white,whole wheat or spinach tortillas.I had the regular burrito with spinach tortillas and fire cracker chicken. They also have a diablo sauce for spicy lovers! It is savory and spot on ! The burrito is delicioso! The ingredients are very fresh unlike the franchise places. Awesome experience can't wait to go back !!!
4	I always just do a veggie burrito and it's great. They have a large selection of meats as well but their black beans are really good. All of their veggies and add ins are fresh and plentiful. You can also get a "burrito" salad if you don't want the tortilla. Also don't be scared if you see a long line. They move everybody along pretty quickly and you'll be out of there fast. Finally be sure to check out their selection of bottled colas and drinks. Try the Uncle Scott's root beer if they have it. When they have tamales they are worth a try as well. Not the best I've ever had but there aren't many places to get tamales in Charlotte much less uptown Charlotte.
4	Some things in life are all about timing... same goes for Johnny Burrito in uptown.  If you hit it at the right time, you are in and out in no time, otherwise there is a rather long time for the eats here.Located in the College Street Shops, you can either enter from the College Street or most likely take the escalators downstairs from the Wells Fargo Atrium.  The shop is rather small, but every inch of space is used... You can tell they have been serving lunch uptown forever since they have it to where the line wraps outside of the shop and you make your way to the register, pay for your burrito, chips, what-have-you and then move on down the line to have whatever your heart desires or as the clerk at the register says, "You are the boss for the next min or so"  toppings glaore:  beans, meats, salsas, hot sauces.If you get a drink they encourage you to come back and get yourself a refill, but since there isn't really a "close" place to eat your burrito or nachos, I am unsure on how many people actually take them up on their offer.  They also close at 3pm.Time it just right at 11... and you are good to go... other wise you might as well wait until 1 or 2 to get your Johnny Burrito fix.
4	Great lunch spot!  The burritos melt in your mouth, so delicious.  Same price regardless of what toppings you get.  It is ver filling as well.  Get there early or you will most likely stand in a line that is out the door.  Also, make sure you get that spicy Diablo sauce!!!
5	Johnny's is still great after all of these years. The line can be long, but it moves very quickly. My favorite are the tamales on Tuesdays and Fridays. Johnny and his staff are super-friendly. You can tell he treats them right because many of them have been there for years, I work at the other end of Tryon St. from his building, and I walk by at least two of the chain burrito places to go to Johnny's.
2	This place is overrated. The food is no better then the other burrito places in uptown. I guess the private ownership and legacy reputation leads people to give it more credit than it deserves. You also get lip from the owner if you want to pay credit.
