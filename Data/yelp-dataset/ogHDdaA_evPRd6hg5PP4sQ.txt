5	Not all dentists are created equal.  Dr. Linker has to be the most gentle dentist I've ever experienced. Had a filling re-done recently and hardly felt the anesthetic even go in!  The office is very clean, modern and professional.  The staff is great too. They're all very friendly and really make you feel comfortable.
5	I have been going to Dr Linker for over 20 years and she is fantastic.  I have a very sensitive gag reflex and she and her staff are very sympathetic about it and very gentle.   All great dental hygienists and front desk staff-I love them and can't say enough about them.  Her staff also takes care of my children and they are super-patient with squirmers.  In fact, my kids are excited about going to the dentist because these folks make ti fun.
5	Great doctor, great staff.  I stumbled upon Dr Linker after my previous shifty dentist used up all of my insurance benefits.  Stay tuned for that review!  Anywho, prior dentist told me, the girl with dental floss in her purse and a toothbrush at her desk at work, that I had 'multiple' cavities.  Like a fool I went back to this shifty Dr until finally I wised up.Anyways, Dr. Linker accepted me as a new patient.  She was very diplomatic in her assessment of my xrays from said shifty dentist.  I felt as if she was really listening to my complaints and provided an unbiased 2nd opinion.  Her office is modern, and all the hygienists and front desk staff are awesome too.Give Dr. Linker a try - If I had one negative, she doesn't work Fridays and she doesn't take apts later than 3ish.  She's certainly got enough patients to work all 5 days, but appears to be slowing down and enjoying life.  Good for her, I'll just keep coming on my lunch hour.
