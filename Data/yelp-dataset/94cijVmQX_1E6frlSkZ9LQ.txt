5	Hatch Pest Control has offered us consistent and affordable pest control for the past several years.  Roq must use a great product because we have seen almost ZERO pests since he started service for us.  The few times that we have noticed spiders or scorpions we call Roq and he sprays again.  I will also point out that the few spiders and scorpions that we have seen are moving slow, obviously from crossing the spray line!  Great, reliable and honest service!
5	I was at work and my wife called me at mid morning to say that she saw bees coming from our fireplace into the house. I called a local company reccommened by a friend. They said in order to come today it would considered an emergency and they could not come out until 6:00pm and the price quoted was outragious.I looked on Yelp and found a company that was rated 5 stars by other customers. The company was Hatch Pest Control. I called the number and a gentleman by the name of Roq answered. I explained my problem and he said that he had a couple of jobs to complete but could be at my house within a couple of hours. Within a couple of hours he called to say that he was 10 minutes away. Roq checked the foof, the chimney and the fireplace and said that he could find no bees or hives.  He said what we might have had were some scout bees looking for a place to build.Roq did a thorough job, was very prompt and did a great job for us.  On top of it all he said because he found no bees there would be no charge for his visit.  This truely is great customer service. I would reccommend Roq and Hatch Pest Control to anyone based upon my experience today.Thank you Roq,Bill Patterson
