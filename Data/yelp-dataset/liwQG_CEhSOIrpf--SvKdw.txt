1	This place is quite sub par, even for a McDonald's.  This place is really ghetto, and there's always a bunch of annoying kids loitering and taking up the available tables.  I guess it's OK if you want to grab a soda on a hot day or a snack to munch on while walking around, but again, it's not very good... for your health or for taste.  I say, exert some self-discipline, buy something worthwhile in Walmart's grocery section, then go home and prepare something worth eating.
2	I absolutely hate this McDonalds.But I frequent it because we frequent this Walmart, so I have to give it two and not one stars because of how often we are here.This place is always too busy and too crowded. Always seems a little dirty (because it is so busy) and for the first time ever, I went to a McDonald's and they were out of water in the soda machine. I was just dumbfounded.The workers here are either great or need a lot of improvement. Most of them lean towards the latter.
3	This update has been way over due.But they have made several changes to their staff and thank God. It makes a world of a difference when you have customer service oriented employees. Some days it is still crowded and the service should be a little faster. It is FAST food. However, there have been several improvements and we have little to no problems now.
4	This is the McDonald's inside the Walmart....honestly I do t have any complaints about this location.  It's fast and efficient and I can get some quick fries for my daughter which keeps her occupied while we go shopping.  At times it can seem a little ghetto but you have to take the location in consideration.  Staff is always friendly and it appears to be clean all the time I go in there.  No complaints from me.  I just get my meal and keep it moving
