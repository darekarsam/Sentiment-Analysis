5	This barber shop opened about two months ago (today is 5/6/2014).  I came in due to a Groupon deal, however, I will be back.  The second I walk in, I was greeted by Shannon, one of the owners.  She offered me a beer and a slice of a Mancini's pepperoni roll.  They only had one barber working at the time, but as a new business this is understandable.  The Groupon offered a cut, straight razor shave, and scalp massage.  My barber, Jamie, did a fantastic job with the cut and shave.  Shannon performed the scalp massage following the cut and shave.  The place is very clean and within walking distance of Point Park University and most businesses downtown.  They offer an array of spa services catering to men.  I am heading back in two days for a $10 quick manicure.  Downtown has needed an nicer barber shop for a while, and Take 5 fulfills this need.
5	Decided to post my review after my second successful visit to Take 5. I love it! They offer great, friendly, and professional service at a great price. I've had haircuts by both Jaimie and Samantha now. Both were skilled and did wonderful cuts on my hair. Don't miss out on the hot towel treatment and scalp massage. To die for! It's now my regular shop.
5	I've been here twice now and the service has been great. Both time the hair cuts have been amazing, see my man Roberto for the best cut you'll ever get. Cold beer, great staff and ultra convenient when you work downtown.
5	Barber and front desk are great. Didn't have time to get a cut before business trip to Pittsburgh from Chicago. Got a perfect cut at Take 5, came out feeling like a million bucks. Now I've got a barber in Pittsburgh.
