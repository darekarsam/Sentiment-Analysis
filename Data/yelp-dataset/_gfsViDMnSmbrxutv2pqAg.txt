3	This is a convenient spot for me to stop and grab some crickets for my Geckos. Always very friendly service, can't say much about their quality of pets they sell, as I use it for feed and supplies only. Way better than hitting up Petsmart though, and cheaper too!
2	I do not recommend going here. I was searching for an independent little place to pick up dog food. The name almost turned me off, but I decided not to be so judgmental. It was really dirty inside and the animals in cages looked upset/not taken care of. This place is the sort of place that might haunt you at night. If you are overly sensitive about animals (like me) then this is probably not the best place for you to check out.
