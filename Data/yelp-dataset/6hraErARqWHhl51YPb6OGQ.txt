5	I've lived near by for over 3 years and never knew they were open here until very recently. Small place but the same great food and very friendly staff!Just like any Frites Alors, I recommend it!
5	Best poutine, amazing burgers
4	The poutine was pretty good, what made it outstanding was the fries. I ordered a small portion of fries (there was a LOT by the way) and two different dipping sauces. The sauces tasted amazing and refreshing, good accompaniment with the greasy fries.
5	So far my favorite place to eat in Montreal. I love a good burger and fries. The sauces are a great complement to the fries which are good on their own. The staff was very friendly and did not seem to mind our young kids. Lots of students she we visited. Clean bathrooms.
4	Great combinations of flavours and nice quality in burgers portions aren't crazy big so you'll be full but not stuffed. Really cool relaxed joint don't go in expecting crazy amazing service because it's not about that it's in a highly population student area so it's more the food then service and food but they still do a good job. Overall experience was awesome wether alone or with friends it's awesome to relax and just chow down on cool burgers. They have English and French menus and the staff is bi-lingual.
