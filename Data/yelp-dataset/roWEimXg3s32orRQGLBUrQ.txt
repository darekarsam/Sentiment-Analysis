5	I have had to have papers notarized quite a bit lately.Each time I come to this store I am greeted right away. The people who work here or the owners not sure who are the friendliest I have had the pleasure of dealing with. Very personable, it makes you want to come here and tell others. The prices for the notary services are affordable. This is my got to place for UPS and postal services.
5	For years, I had been a regular at another local UPS Store but since my last experience with them, I decided to try out this location and I am so glad that I made the change!Mark and Heather, have been AMAZING since the get-go! I was in the beginning process of starting an online business (if anyone has ever been through this process, they know how big of a pain in the arse it can be!) and Mark & Heather have gone above and beyond to help me out! A huge "Thanks!" to the other location for the push in this direction! :)
5	We've visited this store many times since moving to Las Vegas 6 months ago for both notarizing papers and shipping multiple items. These people represent the epitome in customer service...always with a cheery attitude. I recently used them to pack and ship a large, bulky item, which they packed professionally and thoughtfully. They even saved me money over their original estimate, which I had already accepted.
5	I have to give this store the full 5 stars.  Parking is great in this small plaza.  I stopped in to drop off a package with pre-paid shipping.  I waited for a receipt but the gentleman at the counter explained why it wasn't necessary for me to wait if yhey had a number of customers.  He was a very genial fellow.  This will be my go to spot when I'm shipping with UPS.
5	I usually just frequent here around the holidays but I have always had a good experience here. The guy behind the counter is always helpful. I enjoy coming to this location. The parking lot is not crazy and I'm usually in and out quickly.
