5	Without warning my car died in the middle of Phillips Place on a Sunday.  I contacted Ben at Independence who sent Kim right over.  Kim was very knowledgeable and actually got my car on the road in no time without needing a tow.  It was great to have prompt friendly service and will call Independence Towing if I am ever in a difficult situation.Terry
5	The driver/owner was very nice and helpful.  Showed up in 10 minutes!  Towed our car across town in the evening to a dealership for service the next morning.  Very knowledgeable about service and drop off at dealerships. I would definitely use him again.
1	I had contact with this company, specifically BEN, via one of the 'we buy your used car companies'. He was 3 hrs late to pick the car up, after calling me to tell me when he would be here. When he showed up he was nice enough but did not have the correct change to give me. he told me he would go drop the car and return with the $$. It's 24 hr later...NO Ben! I called him 0800 this morning...he said he 'forgot me', but would bring me the money today. it sounded like he'd be here within the hour. Now, it is 6pm. I tried to call several Independence Towing #s listed...all go to voice mail AND, of course the mailbox is FULL. BEWARE Independence Towing!
