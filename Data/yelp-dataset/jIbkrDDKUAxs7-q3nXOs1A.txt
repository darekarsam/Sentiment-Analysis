5	I have been going here for about 2 years now. The staff is friendly & Dr. Yohannes is a really great guy. The office is very clean & nicely decorated, with flat screens in every room. I believe they are even open on weekends & will open their doors after hours if you have an emergency. I really like it here & will continue to go here as long as I can. It also helps that they are a block away from my house, so I leave literally a minute before my appointment time.
2	My wife and i went to this place for a routine cleaning about three years ago. The staff was alright, but the experience was strange. When the dentist came in he didn't introduce himself, he just started prodding around in my mouth. He kept his mask on the entire time. I never even saw his face. He said i needed some deep type of cleaning before they could do a regular cleaning (?) and he left. I went to the front desk to schedule the deep cleaning and they tried to get me to buy some $100 toothbrush. They wouldn't take "no" for an answer. I went back for the deep cleaning and the dentist behaved exactly the same way.  I haven't been back since.
5	We have been coming here for 4 years now. Dr. Yohannes is great with kids and all the staff there are really nice. I would definitely recommend this dentist office. They are open on Saturdays.
5	I love this place. My daughters and I have been coming here for 9 years.  He is trustworthy and reasonable and great w kids. Another dental place told me I had 7 cavities that needed filling. When I came to him because I suspected that was wrong he confirmed I had none!!!My daughters were going to a pediatric dentist and a similar thing happened.  At their next cleaning I brought them to him and he said they clean their teeth well and nothing was wrong.
