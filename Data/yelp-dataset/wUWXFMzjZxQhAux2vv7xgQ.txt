5	I've used Caudle Pest control twice for Bee hive removal. Brian was our tech and was very quick and professional.  We would definitely call them again!
5	I have had this service for years!! Have no complaints, very nice and efficient.  Always get sprayed on my set day and around the same time. If I have to reschedule they are accommodating.  They also take credit cards which is nice and give discounts when I pay a year in advance.
5	The company that I work for use to be with orkin. But orkin was overpriced and the traps that they used wasn't good at all.. so we went ahead and called Caudle's pest control. And let me just say that they're wonderful. Very reasonable price, excellent customer service and we started seeing great results just after two visits. I'm so glad my company chose them...
5	We have 5 retail stores, 2 chain store tenants and a corporate office in the Las Vegas area and we switched over from Orkin to Caudles Pest Control and Im so glad we did. We've seen results we just weren't seeing with the big name pest control company. Brian is efficient and gets the job done, the process is painless. We look forward to working with them for years to come.
