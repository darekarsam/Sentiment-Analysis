1	Terrible service from this cab company.  I know I was not downtown and cabs aren't as easy to come by.  I was, however, in their neighbourhood, requesting a cab to go downtown, a $60 or so fare.It was approximately 11:30 pm on a Friday night.  I had someone call for me, waited 30 minutes, then called a second time myself, waited another 20 minutes.  Still no cab.  I even called a 3rd time and they told me they were busy and will get to me within 10 minutes at the most.  After waiting another 10 minutes I went back inside and called a different cab company, they arrived in much better time and Coop was still nowhere to be seen. All in all I waited over an hour for a cab which was ridiculous.  I could have had another couple drinks rather than stand at the front door all that time.I will not use this company again.
1	Incredibly rude--not to mention utterly useless--dispatch operators. First one yelled at me because I called the wrong region (sorry, I'm a tourist, didn't know you have a different phone number for the west end of the city!). The second one yelled at me because SHE didn't know the address where I wanted to go. Literally, I gave her the street address and she kept asking me where it was, this neighbourhood or that neighbourhood. Again, sorry, I'm a tourist and I don't know. She was so exasperated with me and rude, even though I have the exact street address and postal code! She kept yelling at me and cutting me off. Unbelievable.
