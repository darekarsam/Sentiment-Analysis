4	Overall I loved this spa. The massage itself was great - I had Alysa. Loved: - The robes - ahhhhhh- The massage- The grounds and area - gorgeous- The service - very nice people Just ok: - No private spa pool- No major separate spa area
4	Above average services are given here.Roxanne gives an amazing facial.The lockers/amenities are clean and refreshing. Service rooms are quiet and serene. Love the added touch of a chocolate strawberry at the end of each service. Friendly staff. Recommend. Stay for a bite at Proof!
5	Definitely on the pricey side, but that's the same with all hotel spas. I used one of the summer specials that was on offer, and felt like I got a quality service for the price. The massage was significantly better than what I experience at home, and the amenities are nice: robes, private showers, steam room, sauna, etc.  I had Colleen, who also specializes in prenatal massage, and felt like she did a terrific job.
