3	Love love love the dr my daughter see's. Bes Paragas! She is the best!!! If you make an appointment you need to double check because they do not always call to remind you. Not to mention Deborah isn't the best at confirming. Watch your appointments or before you know it you won't have one. Tyler is amazing, he is a great kid and always greets my daughter as she enters the building. This makes her days I love the compassion in this office! I am so thankful that I sent my daughter here to be put in the best hands.
4	I have been seeing Dr. Johnnie Woodson for years.  He is always very nice and willing to talk to me about my condition at length.  The office has gotten so much better since new management has taken over.Sometimes the wait is a bit longer than I would like but the Doctor is wortht the wait!
5	I recently had an appointment at J. Woodson Dermatology and am so glad to have found someone to help me with my skin issues.  I have been looking for so long to find someone who listens and will help treat my condition.  I will be sure to refer my family and friends!
