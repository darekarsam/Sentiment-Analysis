5	Not much else I can add except you must make the effort to go!I would recommend the south over the west rim(skywalk) as it's the proper grand canyon and in my opinion more spectacular.
5	WOW! Beeindruckend und irgendwie furchterregend zu was die Natur in der Lage ist! Ein unbeschreiblich wundervoller und so menschenfeindlicher Ort. Man kann das nicht in Bilder einfangen. Man muss es erlebt haben! :-)
5	Breathtaking. After reading some rather average reviews I nearly didn't go. Stopped at Hoover Dam on the way and stayed at the Grand Canyon West Rim til sunset. We saved our dollars and paid only the minimum fee for the access and bus trip to the three locations (no Skywalk). Don't feel like we missed out at all and happy to have only forked out $43 to access this amazing wonder. Don't get sucked in to spend more. Absolutely recommend.
