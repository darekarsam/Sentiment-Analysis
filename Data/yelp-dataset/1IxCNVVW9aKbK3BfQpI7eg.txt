1	Don't expect great results no matter how much money you spend.  Kim will only try to talk you in to more treatments and when you get little results there is always an excuse.  There are several places in the Madison area that offer similar services and actually spend time with you versus allocating the smallest amount of time possible in order to make the most money.  It's similar to an assembly line.  I recommend that you shop around.
1	I had a fraxel treatment done here to remove some hyperpigmentation.  Along with the $1000 treatment (and this was 5 years ago), I also had to purchase the Obagi Nu Derm system.  I was told that the treatment felt "tingly" and that I would experience some "bronzing" afterwards- like a mild sunburn, but that I would be just fine by Monday (treatment was on a Friday).  First of all, the treatment felt like they were rolling a rolling pin covered in hot needles all over my face.  Anyways, I went home, washed my face with the appropriate product, put on some ice, and slept with my head elevated per their instructions.  The next morning my face felt like orange peel and was so swollen I couldn't even open one eye.  I was completely unrecognizable.  Over the next few days my skin started massively peeling and crusting.  It was excrutiating to smile, chew, talk, etc.  I wiped away built up scabbing with sterile water and used antiobiotic ointment on the open wounds, but other than that I could not/would not touch my face- the exfoliating and bleaching obagi system was out of the question.  Eventually my face healed, but I couldn't go out in public for almost a week.The kicker? After all that, the treatment didnt work at all.  The hyperpigmentation came back worse than ever.  Of course, when I complained I was informed that this was actually my fault for not following their recommended skin care regimen.  6 months later I went to a dermatologist who prescribed triluma.  1/10th the cost, very little irritation, and it actually worked.
