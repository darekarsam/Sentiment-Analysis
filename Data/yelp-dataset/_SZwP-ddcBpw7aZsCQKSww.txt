4	Office is pleasant and organized. Great experience with new doc - Dr. Joshua Millstein. He took the time to listen and explain things.
5	I love Dr. Millstein! He is the best! He is very kind and compassionate. When I'm sick and feel vulnerable and upset it helps to know that I'm in good hands with my doctor. The ladies at the front are very sweet as well.
1	Over the previous 2 years my wife has gone to see Dr. Shucker three times for abdominal discomfort. His first test was to have her hop up and down to rule out the appendix.... REALLY!? As she is over 50 she felt it was prudent to request a colonoscopy. He agreed and said they would contact her...nothing was done. Instead he scheduled her for what turned out to be an unnecessary mammogram at, you guessed it, a JCL facility. Finally they scheduled her after 2 more visits. The gastroenterologist found stage II colon cancer. She went back to him and reported the finding. What does his staff do? Schedule her for ANOTHER mammogram. The man is a bumbling idiot...do not place your life in his hands, you may lose it.
5	Dr. Joshua Millstein is AMAZING! He is a wonderful doctor and a kind man. He is the kind of doctor that legitimately cares. If you want a great doctor he is the one!
