4	This was my first time in a Scottish Chippy, and this was great.  Taking a glance at their menu - they had a huge menu with a variety of cuisines - haggis, fish, pizza, spring rolls, kebabs... and if you are looking for something deep fried it is likely that they have it.  Service was friendly and fast, prices were very reasonable.
