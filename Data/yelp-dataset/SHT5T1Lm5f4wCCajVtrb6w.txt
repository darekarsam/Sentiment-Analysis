4	This is a great place to enjoy comfort food any time of the day. They make a really delicious waffle with whipped butter.  The service is always friendly and fast, and the atmosphere is peaceful and relaxing. You can gaze upon the golf course while dining outside or in.
4	Friendly, efficient service. Very good chef's salad, delicious club sandwich. Quite atmosphere. Fair prices with generous portions. Senior crowd but doesn't have to be, we were the only family here at the time but felt very welcome. We'll be back!
