5	Clean interior, great selection of food and alcohol. Open 24/7 so we'll definitely be coming here again.
4	I have been waiting for a while for The Bar to open up and was happy with the final product. I sat at the bar and they had fast service great atmosphere (Thursday Night football was on). There is an abundance of HD TVs to watch sports on when I want to get out of the house. Very clean, approachable gaming bar, that makes you feel comfortable and welcome when you come in. The reason for the 4 stars and not full 5 was a mix up with my food order. The manager of the establishment came over and made sure that the problem was taken care of and made me want to return even though my first experience was not perfect.
5	Place is great. Food is amazing and the whole experience fantastic. Why go to a big casino when you can go to "THE BAR" where everyone knows your name. The best experience in town.
5	Love this place!!!! It just opened and it's awesome. The owners are super friendly, food is great, service is impeccable... Definitely me and my friend's go to bar in Vegas from now on. Even though that the bar is busy everyone takes time to talk to you. The atmosphere is pretty great too... Super chill and comfortable. Can't wait to come back!
5	Great food AND service !! Food really tasty too must try tater tots with crumbled bleu cheese omg good
4	This is cool place to eat. Great atmosphere and good food. Good people. Food has been great every time I go.
1	This bar sucks. Wow I was so excited anout this place. Adam and most of the bartenders are literally a 4 out of 10. Even tipping ten bucks a drink there slow. I was so excited about this place and needless to say this place is a joke. PTs much better service. What a joke  to Las Vegas.
5	Love this place!!! Whole staff is super sweet! Great place to watch a game or even get some work done while eating some amazing food. Good job with the location right by my house  I'll always be a regular here
