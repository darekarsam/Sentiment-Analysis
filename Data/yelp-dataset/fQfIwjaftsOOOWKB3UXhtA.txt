2	This review was for delivery service.Not impressed for the following reasons:-There was a language barrier when placing my order.  Several words and items had to be repeated multiple times for verification. Please have a native English speaker man your phone.-Delivery time was about 20 minutes longer than told.  When called to check on my order, the employee was harsh and abrupt. Have someone friendly man your phones.-Food was very mediocre.  Really lacking. My items were more dough than substance / flavor.The only reason I gave 2 vs 1 star is because the prices were lower than any other delivery place to my Neville Island hotel.
3	On the way back from checking out a house for sale, the smells wafting in from the pizzerias were overwhelming. We made a U-turn and parked on the street across from this spot. The Mediterranean pasta was good, just like the service. Not life changing, but still good. My friend really fancied the mild wings. We enjoyed some Doctor Oz ironically playing on their flat screen. My dish was big (it turned into 2-3 meals for me) and I was served a nice piece of garlic bread, sliced. They have a good selection of drinks, among the normal ever so mundane pop, Arizona tea, and gatorade.  The reason for 3 stars is because the meal was just okay, but what you would expect from a pizzeria. There weren't any napkins around and my friend (who was munching on saucy wings) had to ask for some mid-meal.
5	Everything we ordered was very good. Pizza was very good. I got an Italian stromboli and it was amazing.  Would order there again.
