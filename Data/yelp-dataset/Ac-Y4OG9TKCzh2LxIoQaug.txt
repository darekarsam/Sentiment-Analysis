2	Typical Chinese restaurant.  Stuff in brown sauce, light brown sauce, orange sauce, red sauce... ugh
4	This has been our take out joint of choice for 6 years. Is it the best? No. But it's close to home, inexpensive, and tastes good.
4	Is this the best Chinese restaurant in the area? No.. but is it the best Chinese restaurant that delivers in the area? Definitely. If you want a Chinese take out in the University area that has better than average food and speedy service this is definitely the one to choose. Now with online ordering as well? Even better. I've only ever ordered food delivered from them but the majority of times the food was good. I've tried others that deliver in the area (with decent Yelp ratings) and was always disappointed by things like mushy overcooked rice and lukewarm food at best.For this area of the city? This is the Chinese delivery that seems to have the most consistently decent food and service.
