3	Took my son here for croupe, they were very fast,efficent and professional.
4	Dr Surpure is a very nice lady. She knows what she is doing and did great at finding the problem. Her office staff is nice but does not work efficiently. Made an appt and had to wait 27 min to get vitals. Dr had to come back because vitals were not done which extended out stay by 17 min. Had a good experience and feel confident in Dr Surpures diagnosis. I will go back.
5	Very happy with this clinic. On Friday night, my 10 m/o daughter had a minor cut on her fingertip that wouldn't stop bleeding. None of the gauze or bandaids were working, so we decided to take her to the ER at Summerlin. However, Summerlin is a 20-30 minute drive for us and I'd hate for our baby to be exposed to really sick kids with viruses, plus the inevitable long long wait. So we looked up any urgent care clinics nearby and saw that Childrens urgent care and pediatric clinic is open monday-saturday till 6pm. We got there at 5pm. There were no other patients there, just the medical assistant and doctor who were very friendly. The clinic is clean and has a the waiting room divided into sick and well-baby areas. The paperwork was quick and they called us into an exam room 5 minutes after our arrival. They stopped the bleeding and put skin glue on the cut, which is a million times better than bandaids and, as far as I know, isn't available over the counter. My baby was happy as a clam and loved the staff there. We were out the door in 30 minutes. Very happy with our experience. Hopefully, we won't need to take our baby to urgent care again. But if we do, we will definitely go to this clinic.
