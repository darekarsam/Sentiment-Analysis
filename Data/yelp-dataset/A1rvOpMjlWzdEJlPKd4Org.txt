3	So, I'd like to preface this review by saying that this is a Karaoke bar and I ABSOLUTELY HATE doing Karaoke...I do, however, enjoy watching my friends sing their little hearts out in front of a bar full of complete strangers. This bar has been around forever, and has been attracting all kinds for just as long. It's in the village, which means the clientele is predominantly of the LGBT persuasion. But, as most bars in the village are, this one is welcoming to everyone, including the occasional bachelorette party. Everyone in this bar (at least on weekends) is there to drink, laugh, have fun, and maybe sing a little, so in general the vibe is really happy. My partner convinced me to take a star away for the drinks...while they are reasonably  priced, I was reminded that they were a bit small...our waitress, however, kept them coming with a smile and sometimes a little singalong Where it loses the two stars is for decor...it's very dated, some might say a little grungy. It makes it dark and, if not filled with drunken, screaming bachelorettes, can feel a little seedy. I would recommend this place on a Friday or Saturday, if you want a full audience for your Karaoke-ing.
3	The place is seedilicious, two big comfy booth couches facing the karaoke stage, friendly guy running the songs, and friendly joyful cute gay franco staff. The tracks for some songs seemed off key, but it's highly possible that's just me. I kind of love the decor, especially the rainbow bubble ceiling. The song books were fat and full of fun stuff, not hyper hipster modern, but plenty of numbers to wail your worries away to.
5	Love love love this place. Awesome friendly bartenders. and great karaoke as a traveller. It's so nice to go somewhere where you feel welcome
