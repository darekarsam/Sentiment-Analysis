4	So I was trying to furnish my new pad and I snagged a beautiful desk here. I think this place is usually hit or miss, but like the Resale Habitat for Humanity store, they sometimes have really nice pieces for cheap! :P Yay for affordable furniture!
5	I LOVE this location! It's much better than the other one. Every time I go I find something. I mean it is a thrift store so you have to be flexible with what you find. You're not going to be able to walk in and find exactly what you would at the mall. But I kinda like that. It's good to have things that I won't see someone else wearing the next day. Today was one of my worst days there and I still found FIVE things and everything was only 12 bucks! Plus they're name brand! SWEET! I also have much more luck here than at goodwill. Every since they moved to Prospect I feel like it's over picked.
5	If you're a college student and need cheap furniture, this is your spot. Craigslist prices were out of my budget so I went here. I furnished my kitchen and living room with this store alone. Whole kitchen table set (table with two chairs) $20. TV stand $5. Book shelf $7. Leather love seat $100.
