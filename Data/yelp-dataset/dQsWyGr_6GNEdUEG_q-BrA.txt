3	Very popular convenient store located at the same shopping center where Trader Joe's is.  It's a Circle K... so your typical convenient store flare.  There is a Redbox location here also, there used to be a Blimpie, but now it seems like it's all just a convenient store.There have been multiple times where I tried to use the carwash and it was either out of service or slammed.  I think I just have bad luck.I would be careful here since this gas station is busy and people are running in to pay or get their red box movies.  Some people peel out of here like there's no tomorrow so I try to spend as little time as possible in the parking lot for fear of getting hit.
1	I agree that the store is convenient to the highway and neighborhoods but if you actually need a receipt for gas purchase and don't want to wait in a long line inside - avoid this station.  Management seems to be incapable of maintaining receipt tape at the pumps.  I have stopped using this station since I end up going inside more than 50% of the time.  Lines inside, like most service/convenience stores are long and slow.  Other stations in the area are better maintained!
4	Exit Trader Joe's, enter Circle K - very convenient.Pay at the pump worked flawlessly.Receipt printed out with no problems.I noticed a Red Box for movies.I am a big fan of Circle K stores in general.PS: There is a five minute, stay in your vehicle, oil change place across the street. The concept fascinates me, given the half hour wait at most "speedy" oil change places....
