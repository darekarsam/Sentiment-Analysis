5	I went into Autozone yesterday after being told by BrakesPlus that there was about $1,000 worth of repairs to be made on my car. When I asked James (store manager) if they sold Serpentine belts he happily helped me with finding one. I didn't remember which one I was told to replace so he came out to my car to take a look at it for me. After looking he let me know that all of the belts were in great shape and that I wasn't in need of a new one. I then handed him a list of everything they told me was wrong with the car and he looked at it all!!  All I really needed was a new hose! I'm so thankful for James being willing to take the time out to look at my car for me. He saved me so much money! I definately recommend coming here!!
