5	When in Montreal, do as the Montrealers.Except this inconspicuous joint on Prince Arthur isn't patronized as much as it should be. Their pizzas are very fresh and tasty, and the poutine is cooked to order. The fries are sizzling as you wait, and are then garnished with a very generous portion of delicious cheese curds and a massive dab of steamy gravy.I find their poutine to be the one of the best in Montreal and certainly the best value for money. The large ones are HUGE, all for 5 bucks and something.The owner is always cheerful and up for some banter. Exquise is fantastic, and they apparently do some local delivery too!
2	You get what you pay for. Although the location and price is amazing, I cannot nearly say the same thing about the quality of the pizza. If you've got a few extra bucks, 1+1 or euro deli both on st laurent are the way to go
2	Located on the corner of Prince-Arthur and Rue de Buillon Pizza Exquise is absolutely fantastic for people watching!, sadly the pizza fails to generate the same enthusiasm.  Think old school Loblaws "no name" brand pizza, but with an increased chalkier cardboard texture.  The cheese was also atrociously greasy, yet not in the "good grease" hangover combatant type way.Also they advertise that pizza is 99 cents per slice, yet when you order the price mysteriously doubles.  Now pizza for $2 normally doesn't qualify as a bad deal, but one has to consider the price as advertised and the quality of the fare.  And when these are factored in you cannot help but be mildly disappointed.  However on a beautiful spring night and a limited travelers budget, Pizza Exquise will do.
2	2 slices and a soda for over 6$ I've had better crust on a heel of stale bread. Is it even fresh dough? Does one guy just make it looks like he's putting sauce on fresh doe all night? I swear they robbed a dellissio factory. Was quite intoxicated when eating. Tasted pretty good, might return tomorrow
