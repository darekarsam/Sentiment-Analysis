3	Property Letting Centre, based on Newington Road, seems like one of the city's smaller letting agents compared to Grant Management, for example.  They have managed my current flat on behalf of our landlords for the past couple of years.On the whole, their service has been good.  In the period leading up to taking the flat, signing the lease and moving in, they were very helpful, always keeping us up to date with how things were progressing.  They also helped out in the period immediately after we moved in, helping us to set up our gas and electricity accounts.This good service continued once we were established.  They responded to any queries we had quickly and efficiently, apart from maybe a couple of times when it took a few days.  Apart from the occasional thing that they promised, and didn't deliver on, they were thorough and professional.When considered against the many other letting agents, and some of the horror stories that I have heard of them, they were very good.  I would happily rent a property managed by them again.
