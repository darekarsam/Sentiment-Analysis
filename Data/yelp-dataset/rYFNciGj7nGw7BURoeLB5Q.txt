5	since you must go to the dentist, you might as well go to one that is very smart, funny, and good.
5	Despite only being a college student, I have had the misfortune of seeing many dentists in my lifetime.  That being said, Dr. Dankle is by far the best.  He is very personable and takes his time to carefully examine the problem and explain what is going on.  In my experience, most dentists just rush through things.I will definitely go back to him if anything else arises in the future (though I hope not).  Strongly recommended!
5	Great guy!  My father was a dentist for forty two years and my father gave him a five star rating as a Doctor as well!
4	This is my regular dentist.  They moved from 2nd St to Springfield St about 4 yrs ago.  The new office is very swanky....modern art/bamboo growing/fancy pants furniture, etc.   I don't see the actual dentist much (I have good teeth), mostly the hygienist.  She's really nice and makes the whole thing more pleasant.  They are generous with the freebies....toothbrushes, toothpaste, mouth wash, floss.
