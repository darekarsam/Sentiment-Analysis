4	I have been working with Property Group for a couple of months now on a rental house that I leased site unseen with the help of my realtor.  So far they have been pretty accommodating with ironing out the "kinks" of this property.  There were quite a few things that needed to be done right off the bat having to do with cleanliness, safety, etc. and, having dealt with property managers once in the past, I was sure I was screwed.  But Jenae has worked with me patiently to get all of my concerns addressed.  This property is meant to be a rental for one year while I learn the neighborhoods of the valley and decide where to buy, but I would consider working with them in the future if I were going to continue renting.
5	my family and i rented a property in Henderson from the property group for the last year and a half. there service was top notch, they were a pleasure to deal with.  Janae the office manager was very easy to get a hold of and very professional. They were very responsive with every dealing we had with them.  i never had any issues with being over charged for anything or had any instance in where the record keeping was bad ( like Fami R stated )  my family owns a large property management company in Texas and my wife and i own a few rental properties ourselves.they were fantastic in every aspect.  we always had great communication with them.  if we ever acquire any properties out here in las vegas we would definately hire them to manage it because i was very impressed with the service that they provided
1	Terrible very rude staff.They never came out to fix any of the things that were already broken when moved in. Then tried to charge us for everything that was already broken. I would not rent from this management team ever again. I advise anyone who does to be very careful, because they don't even do a walk through with you. Then they charge you to fix up whatever was ALREADY broken Bunch of snakes.
