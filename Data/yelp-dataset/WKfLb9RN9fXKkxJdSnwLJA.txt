5	These guys are friendly and helpful.  The staff is so kind.  When you need towing service you can count on these guys.
1	Definitely an inconvenience and bunch of liars. They say that there's a reason for the tow and that there's a note. Bullsh*t. Twice in less than 3 months I'm dealing with this.... I'm over it. I can't deal with petty people and this company is exactly that. Terrible.
1	This is the worst establishment ever. Good luck getting your car out here. They are rude, incompetent, and lack knowledge. They make women sit out on a curb in a terrible neighborhood. They have no sense of customer service what so ever and don't know how they're still in business.
1	R & m towing is just not acceptable. They have done the worst job at hiring staff members and running a business. They have no customer service skills at all and are down right disrespectful. Very rude and incompetent. Good luck dealing with these folks. I'm sorry for anybody whom may come into crossroads with these people.
1	$171 CASH ONLY for a five mile tow. Need i say more? Reason for the CASH only, nobody would allow this purchase to go through.
