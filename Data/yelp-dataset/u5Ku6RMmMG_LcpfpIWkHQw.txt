3	They are very slow and made 2 mistakes on my burger twice! When I ask for no cheese and really emphasize that you can't eat the "processed cheese" they use, it turns out they still make mistakes. I live about a 5 minute drive from the McDonalds, and when you use the drive thru and don't want to drive back to the restaurant to correct the mistake, I end up scrapping the cheese off my meat.The Fries are always cold, drive thru or not. It seems impossible to get steaming hot fries like the old days. McDonalds will remain McDonalds, but the do need improvement.
3	It is what it is its crap cheap food but they have free wifi which I love
3	It's McDonald's, in French. Absolutely average, typical, no surprises McD's. One note worth mentioning, it's damn busy. I mean really busy. During rush hour you'll wait, inside or at the drive-through. So try another location if you're in a hurry during the morning and evening rush.
