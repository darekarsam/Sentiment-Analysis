5	For Pittsburgh, this is arguably the best clothing store for men between the ages of 21 and 60. Their selection of designers is diverse and spans a number of price points (e.g., Paul Smith, Zegna, Theory, Bespoken, Hugo Boss, Band of Outsiders, Diesel, Woolrich). You'll find things that you can wear to work or out on the first floor and then a jeans/graphic t-shirt section on the second floor. There is a lot to look at and chose from, regardless of how you dress yourself (from GQ to Jersey Shore). Within each designer, the pieces are quite variable. You'll usually find a few really nice items, and the sales can be incredibly good. For example, I got an amazing Paul Smith tuxedo for $400 during their spring sale last year. Their regular prices are on par with Boston or New York. Keep in mind that they usually buy one size of each piece, so if you do like something it's probably not going to be there if you don't get it the first time you try it on.Service-wise, the owner is very nice and the staff is attentive. Their tailor is very good, and they do a good job in the store with alterations.

5	This place is another great place to buy clothing.  The staff  is very friendly and helpful.  I've gotten a lot of great items there.  This is another place to find unique items whether it is jackets, pants, jeans, shirts, etc.  They have a great selection of designers and some very interesting and unique items.  Again, this place comes comes with my highest recommendation.
