4	This is the sister restaurant of L'Alba Dora next door. I would highly recommend the ciabattas, especially the chicken pesto and mozzarella and tomato ones as they really are delicious! My friend has tried the pizzas and pastas which also look good and are a nice size for lunchtime eating (not too big!)I often go there on a lunchtime at work as a treat. It can be a bit of a wait for your lunch but they do have an advance online ordering system, so if you were in a rush you can place your order online and come in and pick it up when ready, so I must do that next time.I like the decor, and it's a nice place to sit in the window and people watch at thew busy street outside.They have a take away menu now in conjuction with l'Alba dora so i'm going to try that next!Lovely stuff!
5	My family's happy place for takeaway pasta when the fridge is bare. The service has always been great - quick, friendly and welcoming. It's an Edinburgh institution.
3	Should be better than it is - like L'Alba D'Oro next door, it's hit & miss so pretty frustrating.Great selection of pizzas and pastas and other Italian classics and the shop itself is bright, clean and pleasant.   Unfortunately as good as the food can be, I had too many experience of undercooked pizza and bland pasta sauce to return.I'll probably try it again in the future to see if it has improved, but definitely one to be wary of.
