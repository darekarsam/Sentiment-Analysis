1	I just tried ordering from the catalog that featured products for dogs and dog lovers- over $100 worth of stuff- and they wanted $13.95 for shipping! I can't believe that they don't offer free shipping on orders of above $100. Their stuff is overpriced and pricey to begin with, so it's just kind of adding insult to injury when you drill people on the shipping. Needless to say, they didn't get the sale. I don't understand companies that screw themselves this way.
5	Great place. The staff is very friendly. The price is a little hight but it is worth it. Most stuff is 100% guaranteed for life. Fly fishing area ( I am a fly fisherman ) is AMAZING. this is the only place i buy fly fishing stuff. Totally worth coming.
