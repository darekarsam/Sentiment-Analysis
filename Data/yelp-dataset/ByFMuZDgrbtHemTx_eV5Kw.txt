5	Gordon Flanary at BYTS is an honest, hard working and fair business man.  I continue to be impressed with the service I have received at BYTS.  Gordon assisted me in cleaning up my laptop, and then later recommending a new computer, followed by transferring all data and setting it up.  This week he spent a day remotely cleaning up a virus on my computer working around my schedule.  His prices are reasonable and the work outstanding!  I highly recommend Gordon at BYTS!
5	Needed a new computer as my XP was dead and no longer supported.  Didn't want to spend a fortune to replace it so after driving by this shop several times a day for the past three years, I finally went in.  I was greeted by Gordon who had some really nice clean refurbished desktops (nope haven't gone the laptop route yet) that were very reasonably priced.  I am on a somewhat fixed income so any help I can get is appreciated.  That was a Saturday and on Monday I was in the shop getting my new computer.  They also transferred my treasured photos from my old computer to my new one.  I love it....Best choice I could have made.
5	I cannot express my gratitude to Gordon and his team at BYTS.  Our laptop was thrown on the ground by a toddler and the hard drive crashed.  The data was not backed up even though the laptop contained irreplaceable files.  Gordon retrieved 99.9% of the data and repaired the laptop for a pittance (in my opinion).  He did this with grace and kindness and professionalism.  You are going to the right place when you go to this company.
5	BYTS  & Gordon are top notch. They are professional and always get the job done correctly and efficently. If you have any computer issues give BYTS a call. You wont regret it...
