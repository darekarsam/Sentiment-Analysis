5	Jamie has been doing my hair for years and NEVER disappoints! I switch my style up a bit frequently and she's always up for the challenge, keeping my hair HEALTHY and beautiful! I followed her over from platinum entourage and detox salon.  I went in today ready to shave my head although it looked great even with crazy roots  I just needed a change and wasn't sure what I even wanted other than that I wanted to keep my length growing... That leaves only room to change the color. I told Jamie she could do whatever she wanted. Gave her complete artistic freedom without any direction other than keeping it fun without making me dark all over.  She used the Olaplex treatment which if you haven't heard of you better ask somebody! It's incredible it makes my hair feel like it's never even had color on it! Soft silky and most of all HEALTHY! Before Olaplex and Jamie is brush my hair after a color service and a bunch of hair would be in the brush.... Now I comb it and no strands come out! I couldn't be happier with my new look thank you soo much Jamie I'll be a customer for life
5	Great service quality work and private studio, amazing!!!! Jamie Lee Diamond has an a great eye for style and color. I went short and I love it, pixie cut for easy care. Jamie cut it just right going back for color after seeing her amazing work first hand. Excited :)By the way she make appointments early or late to fit YOUR schedule. !!
5	Another amazing hair color by this amazingly talented hair colorist. Jamie Diamond hit it out of the park once again. I waited too long to retouch my hair color and I walk in with very sad hair. Walk out looking amazing and bright Yayyy
5	Jaime Diamond is amazing! A true artist when it comes to hair color. Her passion for hair and design is incredible. Pricing is extremely affordable. The space for her salon is cozy and comfortable and she has every product imaginable! I don't trust many people with my hair, however, I would be crazy not to recommend her!
