5	This place is awesome you can find pretty much any kind of battery that's great.They have battery's for cars, motorcycle to the smallest
1	I was not impressed with the employees lack of knowledge on their batter repair services, and simple desire to sell me overpriced batteries that I can purchase on Amazon for 30% less or more.
1	After my second visit I've vowed never to shop here in the future.  Items are overpriced and the salespeople were unhelpful.  They would not allow me to use a small tool to open the remote I needed a battery for...said they can't loan out their tools.  What????  They can't let you open your own remote standing at their counter??  INSTEAD They offered to sell AND install a $3.00 item for $9.99 or $14.99 depending on the guarantee.  How do you guarantee a tiny Lithium battery? Totally bogus and rude.
5	I went to 3 stores looking for the battery I needed. I didn't find the battery or a sales person who cared to help. Then I stopped here. The man working was very attentive and helpful. I had a sensor with a low battery on my house alarm and it was causing the alarm to make noise day and night. The employee immediately handed me what I needed. He took several other customer service steps like greeting everyone who walked in professionally and he know the product. I won't go anywhere else for battery needs now.
