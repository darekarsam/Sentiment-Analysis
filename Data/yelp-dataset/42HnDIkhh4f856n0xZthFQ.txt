5	What a great experience! Before I brought my Siberian Husky there I stopped in, since it's right by my house and inquired about pricing, details, etc. They are very reasonably priced and all three staff members were extremely helpful.I scheduled an appointment for a few days later and dropped off my very dirty, shedding, and frankly mangy Husky. A few hours later I picked up a brand new dog. I have had previous groomers quit mid-groom and call me to pick him up. I have had others finish washing him and call me to pick him up wet. Not at Aunt Donna's. I know he's a pain in the butt at groomers and they didn't complain at all. They were happy to have him. They had a great attitude and most importantly he looked great. Highly recommended
5	On a recommendation from a friend,  I took my pomeranian here today.   Everyone is so friendly and they did a fantastic job on my dog.  Their prices are great,  too.  I'm very happy and Aunt Donna's  is now my new groomer.
5	Best groomers EVER! I have followed Donna from the time she opened her doors, she is AMAZING with my bully pups! They are always so excited to go there- this is also a great place to take cats and pets in general who may have had a negative experience elsewhere they are patient, and really make it a point to get to know YOU AND YOUR PET!
