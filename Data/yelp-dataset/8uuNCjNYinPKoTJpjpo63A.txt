5	Last week my husband was laid out!  Could barely move and having constant back spasms.  He was out of work and in a lot of pain.  In one short week he is now standing up straighter, having no spasms and very little pain!  Dr. Nance Took his time to evaluate the problem and put him on a great plan for care.  Thank you!
