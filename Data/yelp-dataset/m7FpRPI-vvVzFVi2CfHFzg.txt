4	Best PTs in my opinion. They have beer pong tables and pool tables. It's close to UNLV so there usually a big crowd after games or on the weekends. I usually go with a big group and drink through happy hour. My favorite thing is there selections. They have the pear cider and it's the BOMB. Usually the bartenders and really cool, they get a little busy so you gotta be patient.
5	Visited the PT's on Tropicana two nights in a row during my recent Vegas misadventures.  Really enjoyed the huge mugs of Stone IPA, the tasty food from chef Sonia Lima -- and most of all the outstanding service from bartender Liz Brainard.  I'll be back!
1	Sad to report, but I've changed my mind about this PT's.  The bartender (didn't get her name and was a little afraid to ask) is a Comp Nazi, insisting that you play video poker non-stop and at lightning speed in order to get a lousy shaker pint glass of Stone IPA. Boo! Heaven forbid you take a few seconds to look up at the TVs to watch a little basketball.  God help you if you take time out to enjoy your dinner.  No, no, no! Keep hitting those video poker buttons! Or NO BEER FOR YOU!!!! P.S. Generous tips (I put a fiver in the glass before I even sat down) make no difference.
