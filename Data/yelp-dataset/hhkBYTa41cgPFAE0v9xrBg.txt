4	Great decor and atmosphere compliment this popular local hangout's good food and plentiful drink options. Typical German service (ie, the waitstaff are nice, but too few and rather harassed) and a slight lack of flexibility when it comes to special orders or substitutions are the only things that prevent a 5-star review. Otherwise, I've had an excellent cup of coffee or six at Extrablatt (roughly translated to "Extra edition", as in Wuxtry! Wuxtry! Read alla bout it!).
