5	What a deal for boxes! BoxesNearMe has boxes for $0.80 that the other "famous" places are selling for 3X and 4X the amount. They also buy them back after you are finished using them. Good idea to call them first before going out there because they can tell you what type of boxes they have for your needs.If you are either moving, or have a lot of shipping to do, or just want to store your stuff in really good and inexpensive boxes, than this place is definitely going to save you a ton of money.The owner is also sometimes willing to do barter deals for boxes! Try that at one of the big name stores..
5	This is an amazing concept and it came extremely helpful when moving. The staff is very helpful and the prices can't be beaten, they'll even buy the boxes back from you if they're in good condition once you're done! This is a great way to save money on boxes when moving and other things. They have boxes of all sizes.
5	Great service
