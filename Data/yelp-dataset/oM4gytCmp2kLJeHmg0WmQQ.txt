5	I cannot say enough wonderful things about Kinesphere, and owner Dominika. She recently lead a private class for my monthly women's group, kindly opening the studio late to us and allowing our group to bring in refreshments.Upon walking in the door to see a welcome note to my group on their lobby chalkboard, we immediately left the outside world behind us. The studio is gorgeous, clean, comfortable and peaceful. Dominika instructed us on "relax and release" techniques, expertly demonstrating the use of foam rollers and other equipment for stress relieving stretches.Dominika welcomed our questions during the demonstration and easily managed to correct and assist the entire group that evening so that we each had a great (and valuable) experience. I have gotten great feedback from all of our attendees on our visit. The staff at Kinesphere have their priorities straight, they made each of us (with varying degrees of experience and different fitness levels) comfortable. I will definitely be returning to Kinesphere and highly recommend it.
