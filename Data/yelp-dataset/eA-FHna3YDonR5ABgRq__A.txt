5	This place has the best artists in oakland. They're also really reasonably priced and their "get to know you" deals are awesome- $50 off a tattoo?!?! I'm not one for pricing but their jewelry selection has me rethinking it..
5	Got a tattoo done tonight by Brian! He did an awesome amazing fantastic job!! Really great quality and clean shop. Prices are awesome and the workers are very friendly and provide great service! Definitely going back again! Thanks!!
5	These guys are great. Super professional, clean, and prompt. Did I mention they have a good sense of humor? Would come back again for another piercing / tattoo!
5	The guys at Empire are really awesome people. They were so friendly and really fun to be around in general. Paul, the guy who did my piercings, knew bis stuff. He told me exactly what I needed to know and made the whole process really comfortable. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who asks! They have great prices as well which is always a plus! I will absolutely be going back.
4	Brian is a great tattoo artist. He has done two pieces on me now. The second one we worked together to design and I wasn't entirely thrilled with the outcome so I went back to talk to him and he fixed it for free. Overall I've had a good experience and worked recommend them to anyone
