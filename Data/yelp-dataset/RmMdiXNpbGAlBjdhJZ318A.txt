3	This review stems from sampling their food from Bite of Las Vegas so take it for what it's worth.Got there funnel cake w/ whip cream & strawberries. The charge for it was $7, $5 for the funnel cake & $1 per topping. The funnel cake was okay, nothing special, but it was made fresh. The strawberries were frozen unless they were chilled in ice for quite some time, which might be the case to keep them fresh & chilled. The prices for Bite were $5 & under for all vendors, so I'm curious to know what they charge normally for a funnel cake.
5	I have made funnel cakes for over 30 years and have yet to find ones that compare with mine until I tried The Funnel Cake Cafe. They are AMAZING!! I have been to their cute tent at numerous events here in Vegas but was so happy when they decided to plant themselves at Decatur & Okay at the Swap Meet every weekend! Now I can just drop by and grab a cake while I am out shopping. Gotta try them!!
5	OMG!  A must try as you will definitely be a returning customer.  I doubt there is nothing you will not like.
