3	I like my bike.  I like to ride my bike.  I like to freewheel down hills and show off by cruising along with no hands.  I like nipping past cars to get to the front of traffic jams, or discovering interesting shortcuts through the city down hidden alleyways.   I don't, however, like it when my bike is broken, nor do I have any idea about how to fix it.  I can only stare at my malfunctioning machine with a sense of sadness and dismay.In such instances, I am forced to throw myself on the mercy of professionals such as Bicycle Repair Man.  And, although I know I am ignorant, I also don't like it when arrogant men in bike shops condescend to me, or appear scornful about my inability to deal with problems myself.  Fortunately, Bicycle Repair Man does not do either of these things, he simply finds out what is wrong and mends it.I've never been here with anything very complex  - a broken chain, a misaligned brake - so have not truly tested Bicycle Repair Man's capabilities.  But both times, he did the work quickly and well, although not especially cheaply.  And he is also named after a Monty Python sketch, which I approve of.
1	The shop closed down in February 2014.I used it once last summer because I live nearby and needed a link extractor. Even then the stock in the shop seemed very low with a lot of empty shelves and racks.
