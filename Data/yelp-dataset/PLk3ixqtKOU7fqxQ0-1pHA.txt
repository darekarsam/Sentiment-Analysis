4	Everybody writes a song about killing themselves while waiting forever at the DMV. I think I wrote 6........ Besides the fact that it takes all day to get seen I actually enjoyed the company of my government representative. I enlightened her day with a little sarcastic comedy & from that point forward she was a pleasure to have to work with. I always choose a 3rd party DMV for the convenience of getting in & out in10 but when u have no choice it's nice to have an optimistic employee to deal with.
3	As far as DMV's go, this one isn't bad. The wait wasn't too long and the couple of employees I talked with seemed very friendly. Generally speaking the bar isn't set to high when you're talking about the DMV, but this experience was decent.
1	Amazingly unorganized.  I waited three hours to be told the documentation I had to register ab off road vehicle was not acceptable.  They said to come back to station 6 and I wouldn't have to wait.  Returned. .. was required to get a number and wait another hour. Use third party if at all possible!
5	I went to this location because the auto drive location repeatedly gave me incorrect information causing me to have to return multiple times. The last time I decided to come to this location. What this location lacks in aesthetics the people make up for with their humanity. They actually try to help you and do so with a pleasant attitude.
1	Not sure how i expected this to go fast. I definitely suggest using the online resources if you can. I got here an  hour after they opened and as I was filling out my paperwork I heard someone get sent to break! There is no way you have been working long enough for someone to go on break already! It's 9am!! Then I'm watching them just get up and take breaks as they please! Our tax dollars hard at work!
