5	We have been patients of Sundance Medical and Dr Heather Harris since we moved here two years ago. I go once a month for an injection. I can walk in without appt  and have never waited more than 1/2hr.My wife is very pleased with the level of care  she's received  with Dr. Harris. The staff  is busy but  professional.  They call back promptly when busy.Our prescriptions and refills are always authorized quickly.
1	I was on time and been waiting for 40 minutes now! Direct care patients are supposed to be seen within 15 minutes! And yes I'm sure the consultation will only be 5 minutes!! They need to get it together!
1	Rude staff , our appointment was at 1:45 it is 3:21 and we are still here this is ridiculous never coming back
4	Jessica Lucero is who I normally see and am very pleased with the care and professionalism I receive each time I am there.  The wait time is long but she is never in a rush like most doctors I have seen.  The staff is great also
