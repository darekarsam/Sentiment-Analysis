4	This small unassuming takeaway (there is a dining space however there are no facilities) produces some tasty Indian food and the portions are generous. I particularly like the tandoori chicken biryani (the chicken in this is cooked fresh when you order), though the curries are also flavorful, if fairly standard Indian fair.In the area you can't go far wrong with Taj Express, the food is tasty and there is plenty of it.
