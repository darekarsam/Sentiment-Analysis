4	Forget about overpriced vintage shops or Urban Outfitters, a new kid is in town and I must say I am impressed. Located so close to the Edinburgh College of Art, this small boutique boasts a small but great selection of funky dresses and vintage jewelry, all jazzed up in a modern way. The retro style certainly seems to have an appeal in this city and it's nice to see an affordable place for once. The assistants were super friendly (and didn't have that look other similar places have if you don't fit into the "style" of the shop). I am very much looking forward to see what else this shop will bring into stock.
