1	Would not attempt shopping in this store again. I walked in, and was promptly ignored. Sales associates looked my way, but couldn't even be bothered to say hello. I walked around and browsed some of the items, I saw a sales associate and after he failed to acknowledge me, I said hello to him, with no response. He warmly greeted another customer who came in behind me, however. After walking off to yet another section and being completely snubbed yet again, I just left. If I'm to be expected to spend the amount of money some of those items in that store cost, I'd expect the sales associates to be a little more inviting and welcoming.
1	Wow. "Here try this on. I'll be back never."  Zero customer service. Might as well just have cashiers. Be prepared to be promptly ignored.
