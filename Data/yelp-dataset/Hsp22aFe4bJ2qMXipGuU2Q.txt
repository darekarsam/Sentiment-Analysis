5	9th world is THE premiere vape shop in the west valley. (Far west valley)In a world filled with cookie cutter shops and cookie cutter juice, 9th world stands alone. With some of our nations finest juices sold exclusively in their shop, 9th world has something for even the most discerning palate.They also have a build class every Wednesday to help anyone with SAFELY rebuilding coils.If you already know how to SAFELY build your own coils come down for the always wacky and fun game nights.With some of the best customer service I have experienced in a retail setting, 9th world is a must see.Do yourself a favor and check them out.
5	So glad I found this place. Very nice?  Knowledgeable about products.  Prices are awesome.  I will for sure frequently be there....
5	Very laid back atmosphere. Sharon  is very knowledgable as well as extremely friendly.  We went in knowing nothing and she explained everything to us. I would highly recommend them if you want or need info about starting. Also great prices and a lot of flavors. We will defiantly be back!!
5	Here is a great place to go hangout and find like minded vaporheads. Nice cozy front end with displays of hardware with a casual but smart decor. Just to left and on back is a spacious hangout. There are TVs displaying sports, baseball at the time, comfy chairs,couches a pool table, work table and a juice bar where you can talk with the very knowledgeable and SUPER friendly Sharon. I am pleased that someone decided to open a friendly and comfortable vape place on the west side.  Apparently Saturday night is coil building and they have a large table with chairs to accommodate quite a crowd. Great mix of juices I recommend the house juice Lokis Elixers especially the drip specific Enigma.
