4	This is actually a Shell gas station with a CircleK convenience store. I like this Gas station because it's never crowded, has a lot of pumps, and it's convenient to get to. The Market is always clean and has a fairly good beverage/coffee station.
5	Cheapest Shell gas in the valley!  Usually .10 cheaper than other stations.Clean!  Never a wait for a pump!  Bonus - There's a Wells Fargo ATM outside the Circle K.
5	One of the least expensive gas stations in the area. It's both a Shell Gas Station and Circle K. A big benefit is getting inexpensive gas with the appropriate additives in the gas. Honda recommended this station because you should see a improvement in miles per gallon versus poorer gas mileage from other Circle K gas stations that uses a poorer quality gas with not the appropriate additives.
2	I really like going to this location and the people inside are all nice no problems but the management needs to take a look at customers purchases.  Management needs to take a look at when guys like me top off my tank and the pump stops at 99.00.  It cost 120.00 to fill my truck up your loosing money???  Then I put my american express card in and then the sign says please come in to see the cashier,  I got in my car and drove off!  I don't have time to waste like that.  Something to think about on a business aspect.
