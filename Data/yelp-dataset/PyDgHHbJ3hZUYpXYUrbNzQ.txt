4	I can't comment on the whole array of doughnuts, since I had a quick visit more for a look around near the end of the day and only bought doughnut holes ($1.59/doz.). But as far as holes go, they were top-notch and those I shared them with thought they were great and tasted fresh even though it was nearly 8 pm.Overall, Golden Donuts looks promising. Regular & specialty doughnuts are $0.89 and $1.29 respectively. An assorted dozen is $9. I didn't notice anything particularly unique about the selection though, so I'll have to go back and look harder (they'll need something to differentiate themselves from cheaper doughnuts at Albertson's across the street).There seemed to be plenty of seating, but I had zero desire to spend time there since the place feels a little too sanitized and clinical right now. I know it's new, but they really need to dress the place up.So a good start overall. I'll be back to try some different varieties and make a better assessment.
5	Bosa donuts watch out. :)   Great place.  Family owned mom and pop place.  The donuts are definitely better than dunkin.   The whole family liked it.  We will be back
