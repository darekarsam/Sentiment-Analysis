4	If I lived in Montreal, I would be outfitting my house with items from this store!  It had a little bit of everything in a kitschy sort of style that I actually would consider setting up in my place.  It was very modern and sleek and were the sort of accent pieces that you could add to a basic decor to add a bit of colour and interest.  They covered pretty much all areas of the home including bath, bedroom, kitchen, and patio.  But it wasn't like a Bed, Bath, and Beyond that is so big that you can't even find anything you like.  Instead, the small store had only quality pieces that didn't clutter up the place and let you get some creative decorating ideas!  Too bad I didn't have a bigger suitcase...
4	At home we refer to this store by two different names: "curio", and occasionally "the umbra store", because they carry A LOT of umbra goods.  Not that that is a bad thing. They don't only have umbra goods though, they have all kinds of neat nick nacks and housewares.  This is where I go when I need something house related, say a random kitchen gadget, a rug, a lamp, a garbage bin or even a curtain rod. If I don't find what I want, I will at least have a better idea of what I want and what's out there. Its also a great place to buy gifts, because everyone needs a set of wine glass charms, or a funky coffee mug.  The style of goods range from classic to funky.  Overall, a great place to have nearby.
