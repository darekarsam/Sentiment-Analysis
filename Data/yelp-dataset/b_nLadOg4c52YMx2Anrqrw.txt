4	I bought a Groupon for window tinting at Quality Bumper. Glad I did. I called to make an appointment and was able to get in the next day. When I arrived, the employees at the desk were eager to please, very professional and courteous. I was told exactly what kind of tinting was going to be installed and how long it would take. There was a small waiting area in the showroom.  There was a good stream of people coming in and out, and the employees really knew what they were talking about. No pressure sales. My car was ready when they told me it would be.  They did a great job with the tinting, gave me care instructions for the next week and thanked me very much for coming in. Great service and quality work.  Would recommend Quality Bumper and would definitely go back!
1	I bought window tinting for my husband several years ago and it was fine so we bought a bed cover from them last year they installed it and it started falling apart we asked them before the year warranty was up and they told us it was our issue to go to the company who sold it to them. We called the company they said no quality bumper is responsible for the install we called QB again they still won't help us so now we have a truck bed cover that is falling apart cant protect our tools etc...this was almost 2000k this company does not back their work
5	We have had them tint several of our vehicles' windows, as well as purchased trailer hitches and bumpers from them. They have replaced my tint twice for no charge due to a chemical getting on it and a scratch caused by me. The management has great integrity and their products and service of very high quality!
