4	I can say this is the best place to get a cheesesteak in town.  Great atmosphere too.  Owner will come make sure everything is good if he is there.  It is not cheap but it's worth it.  Their fried pickles are good too.  Great fries! They have vinegar in spray bottle for the fries.
2	After a few write ups, I went and checked them out. Small sandwhichs for the price and not that great of one either.
1	This place is CLOSED!!!
