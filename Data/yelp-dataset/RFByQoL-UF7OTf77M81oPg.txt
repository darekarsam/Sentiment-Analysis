5	If you don't know where Heads & Tales is you are going to have massive difficulty finding it without asking one of the bouncers from the nearby Ghillie Dubh or Rat Pack bars. Not only is this an amazing cocktail bar it is also going to be the sole production distillery for Edinburgh Gin and you can see the stills behind the glass from the bar.The decor of the venue has been designed especially for the bar with chairs made from casks being a particularly eye catching feature. The real pleasure comes from tasting one of the cocktails. There is a fantastic list available to choose from but if, like me and my fellow visitor this evening, you are a little cheeky the guys behind the bar will go 'off piste' and tailor something to your own tastes - I would never have imagined a tequila and gin cocktail would have worked but my god, it was amazing!Hunt out Heads & Tales, you will not regret visiting and once you have been there, I can guarantee you will be going back!
5	Heads & Tales is pretty bloody good.The entrance isn't obvious, but that helps to give it more of a secretive speakeasy vibe. Upon descending the stairs you are met with a corridor, off of which lie several small cubby holes. We set ourselves up in the one with the piano (terribly out of tune) and knocked out a few tunes whilst enjoying the cocktails.It's a gin bar, and the distillery for Edinburgh Gin, so naturally they have a fantastic selection of gins behind the bar and they make up the majority of the cocktail menu. There are a few made with other spirits, but not many. I tried the Delirium something, I've forgotten the full name, but it's bourbon based and is served in part of an old water gun, cute! Oh, and it was delicious. Now I'm not the world's biggest gin fan, but the Bathtub was a delight. The violet wasn't overpowering, but could definitely be tasted, it was like drinking a parma violet (in a good way).We did head into the main bar for a while (bigger than I'd expected), and I loved that they were playing proper swing music (again adding to the speakeasy feel). The staff were very friendly, and clearly very talented.I think it's maybe my new favourite cocktail bar in Edinburgh!
5	How have I not written a review about this place??!!One of Edinburgh's brilliant hidden gems! Also now home to Edinburgh Gin and you're able to peek through the big windows into their distillery while sitting in the bar.I love the private booths which are reminiscent of the old Edinburgh Caves.Having worked my way through the majority of their cocktail menu, I can honestly say, there is a great range and there is something to please everyone. For those who aren't cocktail fans (do such people even exist??!!??) They also do beers and wines and there's always just a classic G&T with a long list of gins to choose from.With it being underground and no natural light fading to mark the passing of time.. beware of entering in the daylight but emerging in the dark!!
5	Not had a chance to write anything for a while but a visit to Heads and Tales on Friday after being too late for a gig was absolutely excellent. They don't have a huge selection of drinks on offer, but that's what I like. They are pretty certain about what they want to give you! They're clearly proud of their drinks and that shines through. Alsop the cocktails are simple enough that they don't take 30 mins to make. Turn around time was more like 5 minutes which was amazing! Our waiter and waitress were excellent and the ambience was great.I'd like to see a greater selection of British beer in there, maybe some interesting beers from scottish brewers, and possibly even something special on keg, but the beers they did have complimented the cocktails really well so can't complain.A very enjoyable (if expensive) evening, but worth every penny. **Recommend** - the Gin and Tonic Martini - YUM. **Do not recommend** - Going out in the sun without protection. **H0ave no particular strong feelings about ** - nativity plays being replaced by more secular shows in primary schools. I sort of think that that's fine.
5	After a walk about trying to find the bar (the sign outside is tiny and very hard to spot!) I was immediately impressed walking into Heads and Tales.  On the left as you enter they have 3 little tucked away private "booths" of varying sizes -one even with its own piano - which look fantastic for group bookings.Through in the main bar it was very quiet (I was there on a Thursday night) but that didn't distract from the cosy feel - I could happily spend hours here chatting with friends and drinking the delicious (if slightly pricey!) cocktails. The menu isn't huge but I'm quite sure that if there was something you really wanted they'd whip it up for you no bother. I couldn't see past the Bathtub Gin, it was amazing, but I also had a Smoke on the water which was equally as excellent.  I can't really comment on the beer choice as I was firmly fixated on the cocktails.I am so looking forward to my next trip here in order to have another Bathtub gin - seriously, it's SO good - and I'm also very intrigued by the PB&J cocktail!
