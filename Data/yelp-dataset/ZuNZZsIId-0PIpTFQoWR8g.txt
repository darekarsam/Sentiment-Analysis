5	Ich hole hier nur take-away. Das Essen ist super und bei den Bestellungen ging noch nie etwas schief. Der Service am Telefon und an der Theke ist freundlich. Meiner Meinung nach der beste Thai in Karlsruhe
2	I cannot say good things about this Thai restaurant, except for the fact that the food was edible. There were just so many wrong things during our visit, so I am giving it just 2 stars: I've definitely experienced better. And here's why.My companion and I made a reservation for 6:30 PM. We showed up about 6:35 PM, five minutes late, but apparently, our table was mistakenly given to someone else. So we had to wait 10 minutes to get a table. We were sat at 6:45 and given the menu. The staff didn't approach our table until 7:00 to take our order. I felt that was too much of a wait.We ordered Thai iced tea. What they gave us looked like Thai bathwater. What happened to the red tea with milk swirling in it? It looked more like Indian chai latte. And it wasn't ice cold. I ordered some sweet and sour duck, that was edible. My companion ordered the ground chicken salad, and that was edible too. Nothing to write home about, and definitely not enough to offset the undesirable qualities of the other aspects of the dinner.We wanted to pay when we're done, and again, the staff were making themselves invisible. We asked a staff to come so we can pay, she said her college will come in a moment, but that moment turned out to be 15 minutes again.There are plenty of good Thai places in Germany, but this one definitely is not one of them.
