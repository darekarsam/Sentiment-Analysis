4	Also located in the Scottsdale rare book district, next to the Antiquarian Shop and about a block from Charles Parkhurst Rare Books. Compared to the other two shops, this one seems more focused on the west, exploration, science, religion and philosophy. The stock also seems more obviously the sum of individuals' previous collections, so if you and one of those former collectors have common interests, you're in luck.Most of the books are also for sale online, but lower priced items are often not. It might be possible to find a good deal if you look reasonably hard.
4	The place looks and smells exactly how you would imagine a rare books store would.  Every one of my interests has been satisfied by the bounteous selection and the owner is very adept at finding the rare book that you are searching for.  Screw the Kindle, I'm old school like that.
5	Awesome store, Idk about the other reviews, but I was able to sit and browse for over an hour! The selection of books I was looking for were limited, but for classic psychology books, That is usually the case.  The owner and employees were extremely knowledgable and friendly, I was even asked if I wanted some gelato when one of the employees went to go get some. Little things like that make me love smaller book stores.  Definitely worth checking out their awesome selection of books!!
