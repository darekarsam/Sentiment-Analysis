1	First of all, I don't know why I keep coming back to this location.  I've had so many horrible experiences here and I guess I keep hoping they've had some staff changes and for once I'd get something that feigns customer service.Secondly, the girls almost never acknowledge you when you walk in. They seem too preoccupied with fluffing and folding underwear to stop and help you buy some.Thirdly, if you do get approached by an associate, she's almost guaranteed to have a snobby air about her...SUPER ANNOYING!! Can I just have someone measure me so I don't buy the wrong bra AGAIN?! Ugh!!!I'm sorry, but my money is green regardless if I'm shopping at South Park or not!! However, would it kill them to actually do their damn jobs?!  I work retail too, and if I gave anyone service like these girls here, I'd be SO FIRED!!  Save yourself the trouble...DON'T SHOP HERE!! :(
4	I like the overpriced underwear and clothes, mostly because if you buy enough of it, the other half becomes free. The treasures of a broken economy. It fits and I have gotten pretty good service. The good service is probably in part to my age, I am their future customer and I'm gullible enough to buy 5 dollar undies. The bra fittings were right on, much better than Belks and Dillards. I know that most people don't seem to have good experiences here, but I always have.
2	I was here yesterday and they were having their big holiday sale. They threw a whole bunch of products into a bin and I picked a few out and went to the counter to check out, where they told me they weren't on clearance. Then she tried to get me to buy it at full price. It was disappointing and I still don't get why things that aren't on clearance are in clearance bins...
1	Came here today to buy a new bra. Did not end up getting one thanks to the despicable condescending wretch who was working the fitting room. This woman should not have a job working with people.
