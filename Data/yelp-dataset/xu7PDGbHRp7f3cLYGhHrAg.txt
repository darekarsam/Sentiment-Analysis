3	I went here to watch the Pitt Panthers bowl game this past weekend. It looks very fancy, typical of a restaurant in a casino. The ambiance was modern and cool. It's very big and there's plenty of tables there. There's even a VIP section. The food left something to be desired though. It's typical bar food. Absolutely nothing special about their food at all. I did enjoy their drink specials though. I've heard they always have nice drink specials so that's a definitely a plus. All in all, it's somewhere that I'd go to again, depending on the drink specials but I will not eat there expecting a meal to match the ambiance.
2	The food here is not very interesting.  There's no way to keep out the cigarette smoke from the casino, so that's a distraction.  I don't think I will be going back.
5	Awesome cheese steak!  Great apps!  I would say you should go during happy hour for drink specials. The menu is pretty basic, but all the food is well made and affordable.
4	Best place to eat in the Rivers. Great food and service for a reasonable price. We ate at every Restruant there. This one is defiantly the best. Friendly atmosphere. They are very accommodating.
1	I was here for the Thursday night football game with the steelers and ravens.  First I waited about 15 minutes to get someone to even come and greet me at my table.  After that I ordered and had onion rings.  Let's just say burger king puts more effort into their onion rings.Then came the burger with with which I was impressed with till I took a bite and burnt.  It was medium well in the middle as I reauested and burnt on top mot acceptable.  I saw my server a total of 3 times never asked how the food was and didn't see any managers.  Save your money and eat somewhere else or I guess come on a better night.  I'll never be back again and it was my first time here.  Finally I'm here to watch the steelers game why would you give me the check as I planned to stay here the whole game and drink.  Poor service!!!
