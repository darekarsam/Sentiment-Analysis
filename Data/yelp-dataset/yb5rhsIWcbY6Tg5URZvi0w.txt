1	$79 for 10 shirts and a suit! WOW that's what I get for trying to support my local business!  RIP OFF ALERT!
1	I dropped off a brand new pair of slacks to be cleaned and pressed.  When I picked them up, one of the hooks on the front flap had been torn off and the flap was ripped beyond repair.  I brought the pants back the next day they apologized and then denied responsibility.  They said, "how do we know you didn't bring them to us that way or that it happened after you picked the pants up".  Never, ever go there.
1	After 14 years of taking my clothing here I am starting to notice a trend that's brought much unhappiness.  For the past few months, Pat's on greenway and Tatum have ruined a few articles of clothing. The first was a new white shirt that had come back with black grease all over the bottom of the shirt. Its the kind of grease that looks like the stuff you would use on a machine to lube the working parts. The second garment was a Tommy Bahama silk shirt. Again with the grease, but this time large bleach spots all over  the back. Lastly, a few if my wife's dresses... bleach spots all over. I really wish this cleaner would figure out their issues or else I need to go somewhere else.
1	Over Priced! I brought in 3 items, one long sleeve blouse charged 7.50 which I could understand then 2 small tank top/cropped shirt/blouses which they also charged me 7.50 each. Less material by far and when I questioned the lady she apologized and said that the guy who rang me up shouldn't have charged that much for the shirts, but at that time wasn't able to adjust the amount because she wasn't authorized in the computer to do so. I won't make this mistake again!
