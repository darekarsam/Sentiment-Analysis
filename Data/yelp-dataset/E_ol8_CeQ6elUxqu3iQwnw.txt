1	Horrible service! The lady on the phone was very rude to me.
4	retro 80 dive that serves huge plates great food and friendly service.. the menu is big and they have alot the chicken is done to perfection and they are the king of the fries on the block .. if you got to decide between the 4 other places in the area New system wins hands down
1	Overpriced, unsavoury, feeling terrible right now...
3	good food but overpriced. And the lady on the phone is extremely rude and not accommodating at all
4	I usually take poutine and chicken from this restaurant. It is a great place to have late night food, and it indeed is the liveliest institution at Saint-Henri neighbourhood, I would say.
4	The new systems pizza is excellent!! Very filling but sooooo goooood!!!Fries and or poutine are delicious!!The food  is pretty good I'm always satisfied! Delivery is fast, always open late!Very retro diner looking place..The only thing about this place is when you call to order, the women who take the orders  just seem annoyed of their job that they appear rude on the phone lolBut in all I give this place 4 stars .. The food is pretty good, pricy but worth it!
4	Pour du poulet toujours juteux et genereux et une livraison fiable. Oui, certains mentionnent la dame particuliere au telephone, mais elle fait partie du charme ! Oubliez le St-Hubert!!!!!'
