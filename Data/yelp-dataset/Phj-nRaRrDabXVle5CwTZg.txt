3	My partner pointed out to me one day that all the employees here looked absolutely miserable. That was about 6 months ago and it's proven true everytime I've come here. Today I actually asked my cashier why that was and she simply said "eh, tell me about it". All in all, the grocery store is simple. A small to medium selection of everything. Their premade food ( standard chicken & fries ) is absolutely disgusting but it also looks awful so don't worry about being fooled and accidentally trying it... It won't happen.
