4	I've only had the Mexican style hotdogs here, but they were delicious! They come bacon-wrapped with grilled onions, tomatoes, sour cream, and some other tasty stuff I can't remember. Haven't tried the other offerings, but I'm sure they're good as well.
3	I ordered the shrimp cocktail. It was $14. I felt it was small, there were hardly any vegetables or shrimp. There was more tomato juice than anything else. I also ordered a steak burrito. It had a nice flavor, good. Last item was horchata. Bill total... $26. I'm only this disappointed because of the picture they have posted of their cocktail. It looks fantastic! It's just not :(   the staff was friendly and the restaurant looked clean. I might go back to try some other items one day
