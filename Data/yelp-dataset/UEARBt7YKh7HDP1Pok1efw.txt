5	The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and are pretty fluent in English as well as French. The food is superb. They have the best quiche I've ever had! It's light and fluffy and flavorful and FRESH. The croissant was also amazing and the coffee was good. Free wifi is also available - just ask for the password.
