4	Seven Stars members can use this Diamond Lounge for the complimentary drinks and food. The service in this lounge is great and the staff is very friendly. It is not crowded as its sister location at Caesars.  There are lots of tables and seats in the lounge.
4	The staff is super friendly, and laid back.  If you are looking for a place to eat some snacks, watch a game, or just hang out without the smell of smoke, this is the place.  One lost star for having to overhear multiple conversations about individuals having won or lost more than the average yearly income in the US.  Seriously, no one cares if you lost $75k, don't bet that much.  And to the guy who won like $27k, you can afford more than a couple bucks in a tip for your bartender.
1	This place is a joke. No knives on the buffet. Limited number of utensils leaving some people to grab food off the buffet with their hands. The mini burgers were cooked rare. The pretzel sticks were hard as a brick. Place was dead and chose to not let in a party of 4 in spite of only one Diamond Club card holder.  I understand the one and one policy but c'mon, there were a dozen or more tables open the whole time I was in there.  Customer service was atrocious. I will never go back.
