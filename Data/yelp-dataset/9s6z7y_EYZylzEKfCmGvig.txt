5	Quick and friendly. Really huge space with lots of room to park and the drive thru is convenient and fast.
5	Usually every starbucks I have been to has pretty great costumer service, I was so excited about this starbucks opening up since is right in between my work and home. Well I have got to say that this is by far the best Starbucks I have been to, costumer service completely blows my mind here and I love how helpful they are. There is one guy who explained to me the iced coffees and a lot about one of the machines and I was in heaven learning about all of this! For sure one of my favorite spots!
5	I am a big fan of this drive thru. It is the fastest in town!!  The service is top notch and the people are always happy and fun. Obviously management is very good. Not saying other Starbucks aren't good too, I just am in favor of this location.
