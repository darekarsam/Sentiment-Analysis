4	New restaurant in Pointe Claire Village opened fall of 2012. Heard that the sushi was very good and in fact it was! Made on the spot at time of ordering. Many varieties which are more than enough to satisfy anyone's pallet Have two Japanese beers available which is fine. Maybe a bit more selection in wines. All rather fruity or sweet but one may like this with sushi ?  Service excellent and you can tell they are trying really hard to deliver a good product and service. We will frequent Avocado again and hope others will as well. Need to have some choices in the Village. 4 out of 5 !
5	This is the best new addition to the West Island restaurant scene. The sushi is a blend of the familiar sushi nigiri or sashimi with wonderfully innovative tartars and rolls. In either case it's delicious, attractive - and very importantly for sushi - served at the perfect temperature!  Make sure you try the butterfish - I have never come across it before but it's my new favourite. Salads are also attractive and delicious. Everything is made as you order and there is a very nice counter where you can eat comfortably while watching it all come together. Tuna carpaccio is brilliant. Our last time we asked the chef to make her own selections for us - result was a truly splendid dinner with just the right quantities and lots of new things to try. The restaurant itself is warm and cozy and the service is well timed, friendly and attentive. Hurray for excellent sushi in the West Island - finally!!
