3	This has a large and spectacular garden out back, it dates from the 1700's and was the residence of the governer of quebec. benjamin franklin stayed here in 1775. all in all it was a nice stop, one of the more touristy things to do. staff was multi-lingual, so that helped. admission to the museum was 12 dollars canadian.
3	The house and grounds of this historic home are in great shape. we stayed for the tour in English and our guide was very informative about the history of the family and the area of Montreal through the years.  The rooms are not restored to show furnishings from the original Ramezay family, its more set up to show artifacts from Montreal in general.If you have couple of hours to kill and you like historic homes, give this place a shot.
4	This was a cool museum in Montreal. It reminded me of Greenfield Village in Michigan. There were people in old timey costumes (cheesy but cute) and a nice garden, complete with bagpipes. I liked the 'ghosts' throughout the museum - just handheld phones with screens to listen to different stories - interactive, educational and fun! I was excited to go here and I was not disappointed.
