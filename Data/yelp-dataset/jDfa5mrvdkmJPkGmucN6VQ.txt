5	The staff in Montreal are SO NICE! Very helpful and polite. Most of them also speak perfect French and English.This store is pretty big. Two floors of affordable, trendy clothing.Only complaint is that the clothing is a bit unorganized/all over the place.Definitely worth the two hour drive from Ottawa, though. We need to get an H&M already!
2	This H&M is small compared to the H&M down the street.  It has a smaller selection of the same items down the street in a large space.  The staff is nice but there's just not much here compared what you find a few blocks down.  It's not worth the walk down to this end of St Catherine st if you want to check out the H&M.  I'd just stick to the more central one.  I guess the only plus side is that there's less shoppers as the other one can be full but the selection is a lot smaller so you're not guaranteed to find the same things.
5	Great staff, I dont care that its smaller then the other store or the fact that it has less selectton. The workers here are extremely helpful and polite plus perfecly bilingual. I will just give this store based on their great customer service skills.  My experience last time was that I already had a hat on, and I asked them if they had any other selctions on the store. John Francois, i believe the name of the guy serving me went at the back and found the exact same one that I was wearing. I was very pleased, So kudos! And keep up the great work.
