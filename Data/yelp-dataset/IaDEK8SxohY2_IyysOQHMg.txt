5	I've been a fan of Fitness with a Twist since Verona days. I was very scared to go at first my niece forced me to go after seeing them on ABC news. We went and I was hooked. As a child I broke my arm and I explained this to each instructor and each instructor taught me how to build my strength up in that arm. For that I will always be grateful.
5	We worked with Fitness with a Twist for part of our best friend's bachelorette party and it was the most fun we could have had! We waited too long to call (only 12 days before we wanted our party) so I was nervous it wouldn't work, but the owner made special arrangements to accommodate us. Ebony led our class and she spent time helping everyone get the moves down so we could enjoy it. So much fun!! Thanks for making the day special for our bride!!
4	I went to the chair dance class twice while I was briefly in Pittsburgh. Probably one of my favorite parts of my trip, especially classes like this aren't offered in my home town. Decent workout and judgement-free. The instructors just want you to have a good time and get a little out of your comfort zone. One star off for classes starting up to 15 min late some days and not going the full hour.
5	I absolutely love FWAT. I have been taking classes from them for a while and my pole skills have improved immensely. It's not only a good workout, but also lots of fun being there. All of the instructors are very knowledgeable, patient, and willing to help you improve. I like Ebony's classes the best. When classes are full, instructors do a good job of working with students in groups, so everyone spends equal amount of time on the pole. It's also nice to have short breaks in between workouts because some of those classes can be very intense. I am really excited about the additional floors the studio has opened and the spinning poles!
