5	Lovely wee and quiet place tucked away from main stream.Food was very yummy.Note: they do not have a licence but BYO
1	Extremely poor. Tiny (& I mean minuscule) portions and served up cold and poorly presented...and clearly aged & frozen produce used to add insult to injury.This is the third time I've eaten at Bluerapa over the past year and each time it's been worse than the previous. After this episode I spoke to the manageress and was offered a 50% off next time, but to be honest I was so appalled by this experience that that's us done with this place. Overpriced and under delivered.
5	Brilliant food and a very reasonable price. This place is family owned and puts an effort into making sure we're satisfied. My wife loves the pad thai and their curries are incredible.
5	Excellent authentic pad thai. Great price. Lovely staff. Cute resturant. Fast takeaway. They are welcome to cater to your needs.Veg spring rolls v tasty :)
