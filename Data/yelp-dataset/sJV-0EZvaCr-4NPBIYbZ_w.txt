3	It's a dollar store.  This location is generally clean and easy to shop.  I get what I need and get out.  They are always short on help so you might stand in line forever which negates a few stars.....but for cards and cleaners?  Yup.  If I need something there AND buns or bread..........score!  Convenient location, decent products and for the price who can really complain?
4	Everything's $1. Everything's made in China. If you're trying to find the highest quality stuff, look elsewhere. If however, you're decorating for a party, looking for reasonably priced greeting cards or letting your kids go nuts buying $1 toys, then this is a great place. They have tons of kitchen tools and accessories, which is a great thing if you're setting up a new place or just trying to find an alternative to the $15 OXO stuff that they sell everywhere else. They have tons of candy and cookies, which is a good thing for theater-munching. They have lots of chips and soda for that big barbecue. They have bath stuff (shampoo, soap, shaving stuff, etc), medicines and makeup. They have craft supplies, school supplies, teaching supplies, picture frames, electronics accessories and tools. And everything is $1! We love this store!
3	A clean, well-organized location for the chain. Everything is a dollar and there are some fun things to be found here. I headed here to get some decor for an office work anniversary - crepe paper, balloons, etc. They had plenty of variety in stock and it was easy to find things that met what I was looking for and...it's a dollar!The staff was hit or miss. The cashier was friendly and helpful, but the manager that came out to help myself and some other customers with balloons was not interested in being at work - but you never know what happened earlier in the day, right?The parking lot is a touch chaotic with several stores packed into this particular strip. Careful coming in and out.Overall: B+Easy to shop, everything is a dollar, and well-organized!
