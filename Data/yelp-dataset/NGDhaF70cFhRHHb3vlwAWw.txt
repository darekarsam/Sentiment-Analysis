5	Looked at multiple choices of high quality flooring, ended up choosing a new Shaw product that Toliver's was carrying.  Sales person was highly knowledgable with the product.  My floor was measured correctly, and product was ordered promptly.  Toliver's called me with a installment date and time.  The installers that Toliver's employed were on time and very professional, they even helped me move a VERY heavy armoire out of the way, and then back in place after the job was complete.  After the job was complete, my husband and I sat back in our  "New" living room and were beyond pleased!  I cant wait to redo our 2nd level! We will definitely be using this local family operated company again!
5	We recently had our living room floors replaced by Toliver's and were beyond pleased, so when I needed my upstairs carpets cleaned, I called Toliver's for Carpet One Cleaning.  Again, without fail, not only were the stains lifted, but my carpets were left so soft! Thank you again for an AWESOME job!
