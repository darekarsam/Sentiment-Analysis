4	Nice job on my car tint.
5	I had them install window tinting in my home almost three years ago, and the install was very professionally done, looks great and saves on the electric bills. I had a warranty issue and they took care of it without a problem. These guys know their business, very knowledgeable and professional. If you need tinting give them a call, make sure to ask them about energy tax credits. I definitely recommend this business.
1	ok so as far as window tinting goes they do a good job. you really need to keep an eye on the rest of your car though. they had a huge guy tinting my 2003 Honda and he broke the clips that hold my back seat cushion down. when I brought it to there attention they completely refused to take any responsibility for it. I have referred 3 people here but after this experience never again. $5 in parts and a were sorry and this could have been resolved. Instead they have lost my and any future referral business.
5	They did a really nice job tinting my car, and it's a difficult car to tint. The price was good and the people I talked to were really nice. I did have one issue with the tint not settling in the rear window, but since it has a warranty they replaced it for free with no hassle about it. Overall a good experience and I would highly recommend them.
