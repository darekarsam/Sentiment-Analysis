3	This is a real nice neighborhood on the west side of Surprise.  Quality homes, nice parks, first class school and generally clean all over.  However there are some drawbacks.  The HOA fee is one of the highest in the Valley at over $200/month.  You will not find much in terms of shopping within walking distance outside of a grocery store and a few fast food restaurants.  Lastly some areas although clean are starting to show their age.  Since most of the last big build in Surprise was around 2002-03 I peg this area to be about 10 years old.If you want to live on the west side of the metro Phoenix area, this is one of the best.  However overall I wouldn't say that compared to the east side.  You can even find better in cities like Peoria or Palm Valley.
4	We attended a friend wedding yesterday . . There was plenty of parking with wide spaces. The facility was small but quite  Cosy . It had a beautiful back yard that was able to accommodate 150 people easily.  It rained briefly but the trees  caught most  of the drops. Nice background
