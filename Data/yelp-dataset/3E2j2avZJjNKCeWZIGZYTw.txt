5	This place rocks. CONSISTENTLY good pizza and a great staff of delivery drivers. They always make it right if they make a mistake.
1	I have been ordering pizza from this location for almost 3 years now, usually it is mediocre but always an easy solution for dinner. Tonight we ordered pasta, pizza, and cheesy bread. When I received my order tonight it was raw and inedible. I am not one to complain or cause unnecessary conflict however my order was simply unacceptable. I called to express my distaste and the manager Adam was very rude and condescending, I simply asked for a refund or make the order right. He continued to argue that I was incorrect and they have strict standards. I've been eating pizza my entire life and this pie was not up to par it was raw. Dominoes claims to have reinvented themselves however this manager simply does not seem to care about their new image. I will not be ordering from this location again. Goodbye dominoes I'd rather support local pizzerias anyhow.
