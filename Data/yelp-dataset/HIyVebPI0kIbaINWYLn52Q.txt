5	Brooke is a waxing and facial master! Check out this wonderfully talented lady and your skin will thank you!
5	Brooke and Jayna are awesome!  They offer so many great, relaxing services.  I'm able to get facials,  and permanent hair removal all at once. I absolutely love it every time I'm in :)
5	I am in the process of getting tattoo removal by Jayna. She is very quick and steady with the laser. I have had good results so far. She is also very fair with her prices,  because I have checked out other places and they are pretty pricey. Jayna is very nice and professional. The room is also very welcoming and smells yummy. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.
