1	Well I tried these guys and got hosed. They answered the phone right away and came over to check out my a/c. The part needed to repair my unit wasn't available on a Saturday, so they needed to return Monday to complete the job. Initial impression was positive. After "completing" the repair it was obvious the a/c would need to run for a while to cool the house because my house was without a/c for 3 days. So they left and assured me it was repaired and if I had any problems to call. Well the a/c ran for two days and the house never cooled below 88 degrees. I called them 10+ times over the course of 4 days (the very next 4 days after the repair) and they won't answer my calls and are not willing to correct the repair. It doesn't matter if you get a receipt that says 1 year warranty because they won't come out to make good.This is more than bad service, it's flat out fraud.
5	Rey, the owner, just finished repairing the AC unit at our home. He offered great service at an affordable price. He was very thorough investigating the problem and didn't try to sell unnecessary, expensive repairs. I would highly recommend this company for all your heating and cooling needs. You get one on one service with the owner and not lining the pockets of a big corporation with overly inflated prices. If you looking for good, very competitive service, and are concerned about the negative review, just give him a call and ask him about. I did
5	Rey has been servicing my heater and cooling unit for the past three years and I have nothing but good things to say. He is very honest, knowledgeable and professional. When others are trying to squeeze every dollar out of you he only recommends what you need. I would recommend him to anyone.
