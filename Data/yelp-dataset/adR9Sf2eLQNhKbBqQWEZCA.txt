3	I had a few friends who were fans of Boccacino's, but I never really saw what the big deal was. It's a chain (with annoying TV commercials, no less), and suffers from the usual chain problems: unimaginative food, predictable surroundings. The atmosphere isn't too bad at this location, but it's still pretty "safe." The service, I've found, can be erratic. One time, I came here in the afternoon and had a coffee while waiting to meet someone; once I got it, the waiter never came back, even though I was the only person in the place (or maybe because I was the only person). Anyway, I got so fed up when I wanted to leave that I threw some coins on the table and took off.
4	Awesome FRENCH ONION SOUP! The soup is the real deal. None of that fake Parmesan cheese stuff. Came for a quick and fast lunch and received just that. A fulfilling and tasty meal. The service was great, and so was the food - we had no complaints. The garlic bread was so.... Good. As a couple we shared three appetizers and two out of the three were fantastic. The third one was just ok, but still worthy of being enhanced just because the two were so fabulous. Go here, eat here, it's the right thing to do! And your tummy will thank you.
