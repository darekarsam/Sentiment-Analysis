1	Tests were done without our knowledge or authorization, billed to us without our knowledge, and when we tried to dispute it, the office manager said to pay it or they would send us to collections.HORRIBLE HANDLING OF OUR ISSUE!
5	Sikand is an incredibly competent Doctor, with excellent bedside manner.  I little wait to get in to see him, but well worth it for my time and money.  He specializes in Ear, Nose and Throat.  See if he is on your provider list.
1	Dr Sikand sent me to have a lump diagnosed for cancer but they ordered the wrong test. They told me I had to have another test but they weren't sure if my insurance will pay for it. 2 weeks later they still don't know. Their lack of communication and failure to order testing correctly is unacceptable. I cannot recommend this doctor to anyone.
1	This place deserves a 0 star rating. I was here at 10:15 am for a appt. and STILL waiting in the F@@@ing waiting room at 11:50am. Complete BS and they couldn't give any reason other than it's slow today. BS! Don't book 5 people for a appointment slot. It is way obvious that your time as the paying patient means NOTHING!!
