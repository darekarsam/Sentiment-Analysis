4	On your way to Atwater market? In need of delicious pate? Ready for your mind to be blown? Good. Then come here! They have so many kinds of pate to choose from made from all kinds of....animals.  They will let you sample some before you buy them which is nice too. All of the prices are in kg which make it look ridiculously expensive, but if you get a nice slice of pate or terrine it shouldn't cost more than $5-8 each.
