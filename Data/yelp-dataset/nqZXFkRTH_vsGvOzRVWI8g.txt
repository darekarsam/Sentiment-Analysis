5	Had a friend recommend this restaurant when she found out I'd been eating vegetarian lately. Am I ever glad she did! The food was cheap, absolutely delicious and completely veggie. It's a cafeteria-style serving situation, and there were lots of seats, mostly full.The spanakopita was great, the cannelloni was also very good and they have ginger beer. The second night I went in, there was a live band playing enjoyable music at a good volume.I really can't recommend this place highly enough!
5	Susie's is vegetarian comfort food at it's finest. Generous portions and a laid back, funky environment. I felt right at home here. The veggie burrito was outstanding and the staff was super friendly. Convenient location close to the University and many Fringe Festival Venues. A great place to relax and refuel or just hang out.
5	delicious and such a find while my time in edinburgh.  it was exactly the right distance from the university for the moments when i had serious food craves. this place gradually became a home. the food is affordable (expect to spend 4-6#), come in large portions, and there is an array of veggie/vegan-minded fare for every heart's desire. expect soups, salad options, stews, and stir-fries all cooked with integrity and charm. the climate is down-to-earth and relaxed, with a lot of wooden furniture and art only appropriate for all that good food you are having. for those who like to drink, you can byob. a solid 4-4.5 stars.
