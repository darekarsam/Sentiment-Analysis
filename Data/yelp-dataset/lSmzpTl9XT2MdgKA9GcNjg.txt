4	*****THIS RESTAURANT IS NOW CLOSED***** (We were there on closing night, by chance, and heard it from the owners' daughter's mouth- it was time for them to retire). It's hard to choose between Silver Dragon and Gourmet House of Hong Kong. Hubby and I live mere blocks from GHoHK, and have had many excellent meals there. We'd read some reviews of SD in New Times, and decided to give it a try. Unlike the previous reviewer's experience, the place was full of Asians at dinner time. The "regular" menu had all the Americanized standards, but GHoHK had already trained us to be more adventurous with the second menu, written mostly in Chinese. Hubby and I agreed that the soups and the mixed appetizer plates are better at GHoHK, but that our entrees had better flavor at SD (although GHoHK's are prettier). Hubby had a mixed meat Singapore flat noodle with a curry sauce that, when we heated up the left-overs for dinner tonight, said was even better the second time. I had the beef chow fun, dry sauteed. Delicious. Both places are decor-dives, but clean, with fast and friendly service.
