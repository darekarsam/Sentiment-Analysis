5	Frank helped design and build an amazing industrial-style walk-in closet for me. All I did was show him the original blog post that inspired me, and then we talked through what kinds of hanging bars/shelves/etc I wanted. I drew a quick sketch, but then he went in and figured out all the complicated math/engineering that comes with building a walk-in closet out of industrial piping. The best part was that he let me do some of the work on my own to keep costs low. I bought the materials based on a list he prepared, then cleaned and spray painted the pipes myself, and he did the rest! Great handyman, a problem-solver, and a creative eye to boot!
5	Frank has done electrical & carpentry repairs in my kitchen & replaced parts not readily available efficiently & neatly also in a timely manner at reasonable price.Frank is also conscientious!
5	Frank does good work at a reasonable hourly rate. He shows up on time when he's supposed to and is upfront about the cost of the job. That's all you can ask for. I've tried other handymen, such as Senior Craftsmen, and they were all losers. I am just concerned that once other people find out about him, I'll have to book him months in advance.
5	Frank did some electrical work in my house. I highly recommend him and i will call him to again. Thanks frank outstanding work
