4	Not bad quick and easy!! I had a sub and was pretty good and tasty
1	I am dating a girl just up the road and we have walked in an ordered pizza to be delivered in the past the pizza is amazing and being a couple beers in I am really not sure how fast it was delivered. But I called again tonight to order in for one of those chill nights and it took 1:42 minutes to get our cold pizza. The poor delivery guy took my hurtful blows, instead of  the stoner on the phone who repeated back our information and wrote it down wrong. If you call and get the burnout just call the next company.

3	I recently picked up a pizza here on my way to a friend's place one night. The guy on the phone was nice and helpful when I called to order. I asked if the pizza could be ready at a certain time because I was stopping in to pick up on my way somewhere- it was ready on time and paying for it was quick and easy. I did see a coupon online that they wouldn't accept, so I did have to pay a bit more than I had originally planned. The quality of the pizza was good- I went off the beaten track with some toppings (peppers, banana peppers- yum!), and they tasted good. I would order from them again, but I'd probably make sure I could use a coupon that they would accept.
