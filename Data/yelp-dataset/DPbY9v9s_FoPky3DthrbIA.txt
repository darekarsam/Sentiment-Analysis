5	I went to Sahara Coins & was promptly buzzed in and greeted by someone at the counter. I explained what I wanted and was immediatly shown the inventory and made arrangements to purchase. I had a pleasant conversation with the salesperson while filling out the paperwork. I would highly reccomend them from the experience I had and I will continue to give them my business. They are located in a decent part of town, have a nice showroom & thier website is a good source to monitor preciuos metal prices & is updated daily.
3	The staff seemed very friendly and knew what they were talking about. It was a long wait before I was able to speak with anyone regarding selling coins I found when cleaning out my grandmother's house. The gentleman was able to tell me the history about some of the coins and I was able to sell most of them. The others he suggested I sell on eBay as they were worth very little and not enough for them to make a profit. Understandable. As my first time doing anything of this sort and I was made to feel very comfortable.
1	These guys are the only ones making any money on "Gold Investing". I bought some gold coins from them as an "investment". The price went up over $100 an ounce , I went to cash it in when I needed the money and ended up losing over $150.00 !! Go to th casino to gamble - they have better odds.
5	I was recommended to take some coins I had to Sahara Coins by a friend. They were so helpful and knowledgeable. Even though  I found out what I had wasn't worth much they still talked me through the process and gave me some ideas on what to do with my items.  Very nice people. I have recommended them already to a few people I don't even know!
