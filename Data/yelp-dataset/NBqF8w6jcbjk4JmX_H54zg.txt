3	This location has a strange two-register system... depending on when you come in the staff are either awesome or really slow.
3	It's another Tim's, with a sign prominently displayed on the entry door that reads " free WI FI", which is great. Having said that, however; there is a somewhat disconcerting procedure to access it. One has to "register" with Tim Horton's, probably so they can innundate your inbox with their spam or YIKES, they're in cahoots with CSIS!! ;)
3	They have a counter where you place your order and another where you take your order slip to for payment. Remember your order number!During peak times - weekday mornings and occasionally in the afternoon - the queue will reach the door and there will frequently be a huge pile-up as people mill around, waiting to either pay or receive their coffee. It can be a bit hectic, but at worst I've been out within minutes.The coffee is hot and even though I have a short walk, I still wish cup sleeves were more readily available!I've never sat in; but for coffee to go, it's decent for cheap coffee and does the job. Also great for boxes of doughnuts to share at the office.
4	Wow what a great Place! Tim Hortons has more locations in Canada then McDonalds. this place is great. A little more "upscale" then other fast food places. I wish there was one near us in Pennsylvania... I could have eaten every meal at one of these places..
