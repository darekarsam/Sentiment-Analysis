3	Does this come in children's sizes?  This joke never seems to get a laugh when I'm there, so I suppose I should give up on that one.  Anyway, once you know your spouse's measurements this place can be an easy route to finding  a gift that will come with a return gift later on.  What's not to love?
4	Katie is THE best! I love this VS the best of all of them. I appreciate the help of a stylist...there is nothing like trying on lingerie and needing a different size. They are so helpful and anticipate your needs.
5	I knew what I wanted, pick them up, paid and left. Quick and Easy....
5	I love the ladies here! They're always so attentive and helpful in getting the right bra fit for you.
1	Another horrible service by Victoria secrets I would think that going out-of-state would make the service better but no everything is officially the same, plain horrible. All I wanted to do was come in and buy a strapless bra maybe even two or three spend I don't know a hundred $200. They brought me into the dressing room and I got measured and I was told that I was a 34 double D. I have always been a B or C cup my entire life. This is the one store where they will tell you that you have bigger boobs than you really do to make yourself feel better. I was told that I was double D but if I go to another store and I look at their double D's they will fit my head! I told the lady just please bring me every type of strapless bra that you have in my cup size and it took her 10 minutes to bring each individual bra. I was shocked! I would've been able to pick out all the strapless bras they had in the entire store in the color that I wanted in that 10 minutes. She brought me all the ugly bras that were not even push up that I asked her for....  I just left the bras on the chair and left. Never coming back here again. You just lost a customer that would be spending several hundreds of dollars a month.
