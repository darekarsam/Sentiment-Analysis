5	I went to see Joel with a torn rotator cuff or shoulder impingement.  It was at the point of serious pain, well past discomfort.  Joel took the time to explain the workings of the shoulder and all of the muscles associated with it.  He then provide excessent trigger point and deep tissue massage which provided me with much needed pain relief.  He also suggested methods of after care to avoid further inflaming of the injury.  I would highly recommend Joel.  Knowledgeable, approachable, and professional
