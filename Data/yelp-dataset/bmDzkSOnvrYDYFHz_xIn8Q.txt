1	Today my little sister was to take her driving test after school, which is a very small time frame between then and when the DMV closes. Her instructor was half an hour late, causing her to miss the time frame to take the driving test. He then LEFT HER THERE while she was getting her picture taken and make the necessary payments. He didn't say a word, didn't tell her he was leaving or that he'd be back in a minute. He waited until she was preoccupied and left to get "medicine for his throat". During that time my sister finished everything she had to do and turned to find herself stranded. He is her ride. She called our mother, who then in turn called the ABC driving school office and was greeted by unprofessional and impervious employees. She is paying for 6 hours of driving practice, and because of the instructor's complete incompetence, my sister was only given about 3 hours. For the amount they are paying, that is ridiculous.Manage your people, ABC Driving School.Completely unacceptable.
1	Do not use this company !!!!! Completely incompetent . The instructor was smoking and cursing and not even paying attention while he took my daughter to a shady part of town to take her test . When I called the company to complain they acted stupid refused to acknowledge any wrong doing and hung up on me ! Very unprofessional !! Oh and when I first called they thought I was someone else calling to complain about  another incident ..... Wow!! do not let your child get in the car with these people
4	This is a great driving school to practice all the rules needed for your Road Test! I would highly recommend ABC Driving School l. Great customer service when scheduling Lessons and Road Tests! My instructor was Brandon & he is one of the best instructors I've had & really helped me pass my Road Test today!!!! Thanks again Brandon!!
