5	Small store but the customer service is fantastic . I deal with the manager and the ladies in customer service area on a weekly basis and all have gone out of there way to help me out .
5	This is gonna be OUR Giant Eagle. The people are nice. Enough said. Great market. LOL at the people hunting down a garlic press for us, the power going out, and the lady who liked Darren's Dethlehem shirt which is actually mine. :)
5	You don't appreciate Giant Eagle until you shop at a store like Bottom Dollar. They don't give rain checks on advertised items that are out of stock. And they don't give you the item free when the cashier rings up the wrong price. They won't match sale prices at Giant Eagle even though their ads says that they'll beat other stores' prices by a penny. They don't even give you bags. The quality of the food at Giant Eagle is far better than other stores. Also, Bottom Dollar only has a parttime manager, who isn't even there if you shop in the morning. Most importantly, you are treated as a respected customer at Giant Eagle and are treated like trash by Bottom Dollar. By the way, I have no connection to Giant Eagle except as a customer.
2	A very oddly laid out supermarket. the Deli isle is not very wide, the the walls are closing in on you, and they put the DIY olive cart in front to make it more cluttered. Just a poorly laid out store which is showing it's age.
1	Dirty and small.  Not laid out well.  Expired items on the shelves.  Rude cashiers.  Self check out usually broken.  Horrible experience more than once.  I don't shop here unless I have to.
