1	Only gave these guys one star cause I had to choose something. That one star is me being very generous. Some jerk answered the phone and I explained I was looking for parts. Fuel filter to be exact on a seadoo older 93 model, jack ass replied " call ride on" and hung up on me. Called back four times then someone else answers and says oh yea we have those parts, but what's the engine? (Which this shouldn't matter because they only use one on the older models) I just hung up at that point because these people obviously have no brains. I called AZ JET SKI in Cave Creek and spoke with Jim- super helpful and knew EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. He definitely won my business. Now I have a new filter and get to enjoy the water not thanks to Valley Marine!
1	Check around and google this place.  You will see it is normal for him to quote one price then ask a lot more when it's time to pay.  Then will hold your boat hostage.  Don't walk.  Run to a different place unless you have good lube.  You will get screwed.  His employee even apologies to me and said he does it to everyone.  Wish I had done more research first.
1	Quoted me one price for diagnostics then tried to double it before he fixed anything .quoted me 4k because carbs and whole fuel system needed replaced.. Got a second opinion which proved none of the fuel system was the issue... Not a trustworthy business in my opinion .
