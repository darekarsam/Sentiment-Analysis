2	I went there one hour after they opened for a sandwich. The food was OK but they did not have any change. The person who was suppose to open the safe did not show up yet. Person at the counter had to use his own money to give me change.
4	2 Medium Pizzas for 5.99 each. That was the special. I've always liked Domino's even when food critics were not on their side. I was not happy with my last order but I blame me. I am not the biggest fan of thin crust pizza unless it is wood oven baked. I wanted to try something different so I did but I just did not seem to like their version. I will tell you my Pizza's were hot and ready when promised. My food was fresh served with a friendly smile. I will return only to have hand toss crust.
4	So I've been a pretty regular orderer from this Domino's. Over the years, I have had good and okay service with this Domino's. But, I have finally found the pizza that I love in everyway and I want to shout it from the mountain tops....It's a pizza that everyone should try. I started ordering their homemade pan pizza with spinach and ham and white sauce (indigestion kicks in with too much red sauce) and it is fabulous. Can't say it enough. You can choose any two toppings, but this pizza is perfect and their service has way improved lately.
5	Great pizza when I'm in a hurry or have friends over. A special shout out to my usual delivery guy Nick. He delivers to my house super fast and is always friendly. That really makes a difference.
5	Placed order online. Loved watching the status!! It arrived as promised...it was correct and arrived HOT!!  Love this option when I just do not feel like cooking (or going out)! Thanks Domino's!
