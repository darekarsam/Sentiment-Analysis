5	My wife & I recently purchased a home in North Scottsdale and were in the market for a home entertainment and digital specialist. Like other major purchases we conducted a through RFP process and interviewed several home entertainment firms. Our decision in picking Desert Valley was based on their depth of knowledge, experience, references , competitive pricing and overall customer service; both during the installation and post installation.It's not often when you can say that a resource exceeded your expectations on all accounts, but Desert Valley was one of those resources.  Not only was the installation state of the art and works terrific, but most important Desert Valley did many follow up with us in getting our installation to work just right and making sure we were 100% satisfied. We highly recommend them and believe it would be impossible to go wrong with Desert Valley for your home entertainment and audio & video needs.
5	We purchased a winter home in Phoenix. We contacted Desert Valley Audio for our audio needs. Right from start to finish of our project of TVs, security cameras, complete Control4 system, audio system throughout the house. Desert Valley Audio did a fantastic job. Quote was close to bang on by the end of the project, install time was exactly as they said. We would highly recommend Desert Audio.
