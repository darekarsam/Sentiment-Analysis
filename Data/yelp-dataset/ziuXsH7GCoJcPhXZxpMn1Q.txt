4	This new location is perfect for those working near Nellis AFB! As I was driving somewhere else to eat, I saw that the new location was open. My friend and I immediately decided to change dinner plans! Capriotti's is a sandwich shop doing things right! Best sandwich on the menu is the Bobbie! It is thanksgiving in a sandwich...including turkey, cranberries, and stuffing. How awesome is it to be able to get the day-after-thanksgiving sandwich 24/7?! Yes, 24/7... The sandwich shop is you average sandwich place, but the Bobbie 24/7 makes this place a 4! Highly recommend trying this place....the chocolate chip cookie dough brownies are pretty perfect, too!
5	This was my first visit to this establishment (or the chain itself) but I have to say that I was HIGHLY IMPRESSED. I do a lot of contract work at various sites in the valley and just happened across this place. My personal opinion of this place is an A+ 5-star rating (I wish they had 10)The staff were friendly, they had a place to sit and eat. Unlimited free refills on soda for the duration of your visit. I will definitely be a repeat customer.
2	I'm writing this review while I'm trying to enjoying my meal at this Capriotti's  location. The food is good. But the staff.... oh man.There must be a shift change happening. (3:10pm). A few guys walked out of from behind the counter. Just clocked out I assume. The all sat down at a table right next to mine and started talking. Loud F bombs, yelling at the workers who were still on the clock from behind the counter and a general uncomfortable feeling about the topic of their conversation is how I enjoyed my meal. Oh... and Dr. PEPPER  comes out of the Coke dispenser. I love this sub chain, but I won't be back to this one. Staff reflects management.... and with that being said, I'm sure my Capastrami sandwich addiction will have me looking elsewhere. 2 stars.
