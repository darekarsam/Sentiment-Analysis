4	I stopped in here to V I O C the day before heading on the road to Chicago for the Salsa Congress. This is my oil change place.  Ricky and the crew are always nice, not pushy, greet me with a smile when I'm in and never frown when I present them with a coupon.It's close to my plush palace in Mc Farland and I like it.You may too...
1	I DO NOT recommend getting an oil change here.  My wife has taken our car here two times. Each time she has been tricked into buying services that are unneeded. Just last week, she took our car there for an oil change. While there, our car would not start so the employees gave her a jump start. When she brought the car home I noticed that there was acid seeping out of the top of the battery. The employees did not mention this and we could see where they had attached the cables to the acid burned part of the battery. I also noticed that the coolant tank was completely empty. WTF?Woodman's East is a much better place to get an honest oil change.
3	I felt very strange here.  There are no lights indicating it is open, so when I pulled in, I actually began to pull back.  Then the door opened.  I had several questions right away and they seemed unable to answer them because they have a "routine."  Like you must sit before we talk.  When I went to go pay, it was awkward.  I asked where my key was and they just pointed.  It was odd the way the employees are so fast and knowledgeable but they can not seem to communicate where I should go to pay or where I would find my key.  The place is PRICEY!  I paid $10 more than I usually get charged at Jiffy Lube.  This was for a standard conventional oil change.  I needed an oil change and this was semi-convenient.  I guess this is what I get.
