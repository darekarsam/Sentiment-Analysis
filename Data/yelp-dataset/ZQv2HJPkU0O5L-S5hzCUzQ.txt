5	Last night about 5pm our hotel lost water to the whole building.  We contacted four different plumbing companies to come out right away and help us, but found that no one would come out for several hours or until the next day.  Fast Plumbing arrived within an hour and fixed the problem right away.  They were friendly and professional, and we genuinely appreciate their service in our time of need. Great job!
5	I've been using Fast Plumbing for years now and couldn't be happier.  They are so good at what they do! They are fast and curteous, helpful and friendly.
