1	Sweeeeeeeeeeet Jesus.  This place is S-C-A-R-Y.  Once all the trash has passed over your feet and the 4th adult person with 4 teeth (total) has stopped bothering you, you are then propositioned by a sweet pretty little cracked out hooker to come meet some of her friends. You enter the store.  Grab whatever you need (for me, it was diet coke), pay and RUN LIKE HELL to your car if it is still there.I work by this particular Cirlce K, we call it the Cracked Out  K.  ** This review was based on a good day.  **
2	We stopped in here for a gallon of water and some vitamin waters- pretty dirty place. I watched some chick go to the donut area and naked fist a donut and start eating it, in front of the clerk. Which is ok to them, I guess, but it is so not alright when you hand them an apparently incorrect amount thinking it is. In that case, they yell it even louder. For all we know my boyfriend did give her five dollars, and she took one, and then yelled it was 4.some odd cents making him give her another. Probably did go down that way.
