5	Excellent service for a good price. We had our locks changed after moving into a house in Squirrel Hill. The locksmith was able to schedule an appointment a few days from when we called. He arrived on time for our appointment and had all the necessary equipment for changing over three door locks, including re-drilling one door and changing the key on an odd patio door lock. The gentleman was friendly, quick, and competent. The process took less than an hour and cost about $150.
5	good quality and low price, two keys cost me only 3.85. I tried to find the "city locksmith" near centre ave but couldn't find it anywhere lol. This one on Murray is just ur 5 star choice
5	I've had keys made, knives sharpened and misc hardware items picked up here.  The couple who owns it is so nice!  Prices are good, service is great and it's right down the street from me.If you are in the area this should be your hardware store of choice!
5	Friendly and fast. Will go back to buy deadbolts as soon as I can .
5	Super fast and affordable.  I have had many keys made here.
5	I've been locked out of my house on campus a few times and this guy came to my rescue in a snap! He's fast, reliable, and extremely experienced. I've also had a few keys made at his store which is filled with reasonably priced hardware. It pretty much has most of the basic things you may need without taking the trip to Home Depot. I'll definitely be back again
5	Very friendly staff and great service!
5	Timely, helpful, honest!
5	Nam is great to work with.  He knows his locks!  Able to fix one that was constantly causing us trouble.  Also brought a vacuum in to fix and he let me know that it wasnt worth it for the price of the part.
