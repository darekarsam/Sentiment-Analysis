5	Wonderful studio, fantastic teachers!
5	Great, passionate instructors! There is an intimate element about this family.  Students are valued and the instructors truly care about their success.
5	Awesome instructors and classes. I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for dance classes for their students. They offer high quality classes and never discriminate between competition and recreational students (this is not true of all dance schools). Every student receives the same high quality education.
