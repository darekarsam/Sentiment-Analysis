5	I have been coming to Destiny fitness since they opened. All I can say is I absolutely love this place! The instructors are so wonderful and they always make sure that everyone is safe and tells us to "stay hydrated". If your looking for a great place to get your Zumba on and shake that booty into shape, this is your place! Celeste, Gloria, Harmony, Leilani, and now Stephen will help you do just that! Their are also Pilates and Yoga classes with Shawnah and a new Boot Camp starting with Jacquese. I love going here and am there 2-5 times a week! They are no pressure and not judgmental. Everyone is free to do the workouts at their own pace! I love that!No coordination you say?? Don't worry about it!!! Just come and have fun!There is always an updated schedule posted on their website, NO EXCUSES, JUST DANCE!
