1	I was in town from Phoenix on business.  I sat on the sports bar side and enjoyed all the tv's.  I had their ribs.  They were ok. Certainly nothing to jump up and down about.  Had nice selection on beers on tap!   Decided to go back on a Saturday and tried the wings. They were NOT good. They were very dry. They cooked them frozen!!  Yuck.  I was also passed because they wanted to charge me $5 to watch the fight.  I didn't know about a fight and only wanted to eat and gave a few beers.  I finished my bad wings and was enjoying my second beer when the waiter said if your not going to eat I'll have to charge you $5. All I wanted to do was enjoy my beer.  So I paid my bill and left. I had planned to go there and watch the CFL playoffs on Sunday. That's not going to happen!  Won't ever go back.
3	Service was really good. No complaints. I had a bacon cheeseburger with soup as side. Soup was just warm although good. Burger was ok. Nothing special. Prices are reasonable. Bar on one side dinning room on other.
4	Great job ! We went to a show afterwards so we were in a bit of a hurry. The food was awesome, and speedy and we even had time after to talk.  The waitress was really nice, funny and wasAs helpful as can be.I've had a few different menu options but the burger and fries is one of the best in town.  Keep up the great work and thanks for making sure that cx service is just as great as the food.
