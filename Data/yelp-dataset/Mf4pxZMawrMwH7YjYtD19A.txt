1	As far as wells fargo goes I've never had an issue with them.  However this particular branch is completely incompetent when it comes to customer service.  They are rude, snide and could frankly give two shits about their customers. Ive been banking wroth wells for so long and this branch had me thinking about switching all together.  I wouldn't recommend banking at this location unless you want to take the most difficult road to achieving your goals. No one is willing to help in any way. All they do is quote the guidelines and try to talk over you.  They need training for sure.
1	I have been banking with Wells Fargo for 14 years. I used to recommend Wells Fargo to lots of my friends and family, but over the years their customer service and policies have become the worst I have ever experienced. I got, $70 in overdraft fees for over drafting a little over $1. When I tried to dispute the check that made me overdraft since I didn't write that check they told me they couldn't do anything for me but would return $35 of the $70 they charged. No thank you. I also don't appreciate the rude demeanor the employees take with me anytime I go in to any Wells Fargo bank the bankers and teller are only pleasant when you are willing to buy one of the services that they sell otherwise you can just expect a difficult unfriendly transaction! I wish I could give this bank no stars.  I am going to now pay their stupid fee and close my account. On the fees note it looks like wellsfargo has been charging overdrafts fees Illegally here's the link to the story washingtonpost.com/blogs... DONT BANK HERE!
