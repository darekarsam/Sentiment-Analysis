5	City BEACH in Montreal !!! And it is free by the way.  They have an area for getting your drink on.  They have chairs and umbrellas, throw in a free bathroom you can BYOB.  The sand is high grain, fine white sand that they truck in so it will get in everything so dress accordingly, ie, sandals.  I was there Friday afternoon in August when the weather was perfect and it was not crowded at all, people stopping by to sit and chat for a bit after work.They just need water access and it will be complete
3	It's a beach.  In a city.  Picture a small strip of sand, surrounded by parking lots.  If you find yourself there, then you might as well stop by - but otherwise, it's not the end of the world if you miss it.  Montreal has much better attractions.  Even within a five minute walk of here.On that note, it makes a fine place to stop by while walking between attractions.
