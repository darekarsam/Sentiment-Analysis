5	Pistachio donut was a-mazing... I tried it at the food truck festival (bouffons montreal - drop what you're doing and GO THERE INSTEAD!) and everyone was drooling over their donuts and they couldn't make 'em fast enough. I shared with two friends and we all agreed that this donut was out of this world. I will be back!
1	I don't know why the comments about the donuts here are good.  For me, it is gross.  I bought an chocolate donut when I pass by, $4.  It is super oily and greasy.  Very dense, too.  The chocolate topping is made with chocolate , butter and walnuts, I think, very greasy,too. And the donut itself doesn't taste much,  Neither salty nor sweet, quite plain. I shared with my husband to see what's his opinion, turns out he just took a bit and the rest went to the garbage. Won't go back again.
1	Overpriced, grossly oversized, greasy donuts that are tasteless a day on.Don't believe the hype. The brownies I got for having spent over $15 were good, however.
