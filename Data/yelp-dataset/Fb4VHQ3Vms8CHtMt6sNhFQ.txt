5	Healthy alternative to the regular fast food offered at your normal food court. Located within the Luxor Hotel and Casino...right by Starbucks and across from McDonald's. Friendly and quick staff. Lovely service! The menu selections include freshly made sub sandwiches, wraps, grilled paninis, and fresh fresh tasty salads. With each order, you can decide if you want a side of fries or small salad for an additional cost. Also offered is the premium deli meats and cheeses sliced right in-front of you!Wish this establishment exists in Hawaii as their food tastes amazing.
3	I feel disheartened to give " LA Subs " a mediocre review due to the 5 Stars they have gotten below. Myself and my friend decided to try their food out last night. I ordered the chicken mozzarella with pesto sauce no tomatoes panini. My friend ordered a bacon Sandwich with no cheese. Both meals made both of our stomachs feel not the best afterwards and now this morning I'm still feeling ill. I didn't eat the other half of my sandwich either. The taste was meh. Nothing I couldn't do better and if I can top it then that's scary. Hoping we just had a bad experience and if we try it again it'll be more satisfying with zero tummy ache.
1	This place is horrible! The bread was old and they didnt even have pickles!  The sandwich was put together very poorly and was not cut properly. They still messed up our order even after we corrected them. We will never be coming back again.
