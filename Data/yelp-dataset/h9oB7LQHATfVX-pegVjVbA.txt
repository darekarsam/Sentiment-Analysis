1	Go anyplace but here! We have had a couple of times that it is after hours, needed medical attention but didn't want to do the ER. The first time, after paying, all they in the office was a Nurse Practitioner that couldn't do what I needed done. The next time they had a Nurse Practitioner, which I figured, but get back there and they don't have the damn supplies! I will never darken their door again!
2	I hate giving bad reviews to a place I have only been to one but The doctor (tran) is a total ass. He was rushing and even charged my dad just to tell him, "there is nothing I can do." After that it was my turn, oh boy was he just down right rude! He is one of those people who is just quick with their mouth, makes smart ass comments, and probably doesn't think before he speaks. If it wasn't for the rest of the staff, quick service (now I see why it was quick, the doctor probably rushed everyone else out like us), and amazing pharmacist I would have given it 0 stars if possible. I've heard great things about this clinic itself but hopefully I will get a different doctor next time. Overall the rest of the staff and pharmacist were amazing.
3	Ive been there twice and the wait was horrible first time took them 2 hrs and I was early to my appointment.  The second time I also had an appointment and took them an hour and i didn't even need to see the doctor.
