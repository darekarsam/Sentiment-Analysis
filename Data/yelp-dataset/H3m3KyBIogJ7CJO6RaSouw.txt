5	This is my favorite grocery store for my Korean and Japanese cuisine needs. They have a range of products such as dry seaweed, japanese curry boxes, instant ramen, japanese sushi rice, tofu, kimchi, seaweed salad, mochi, mochi ice cream, frozen dumplings and seafood, condiments such as rice vinegar and mirin, sesame oil, wasabi etc. They have  LOTS of products. The grocery store is very clean and you can spend about $20-30 for a decent amount of groceries....for one person though. It;s located near Atwater metro and you have to walk a few blocks. I like the cleanliness and the variety which makes it a grocery store that I like to visit every month at least once.
4	Going to high school in Flushing Queens in NY I've seen my share of Korean grocery. On a trip with a friend to Montreal I wanted to see the Canadian/Montreal interpretation of Korean. Would they have all my favorite things from back home? Plus, we walked past this place on the way to the AMC and my curiosity won out. Interesting selection of tofu, kimchi, dumplings, condiments and desserts. Having a bit of a sweet tooth, I focused on the desserts and bought a selection of ice creams green tea, melon, red bean to bring back to my friend. The whole bag came to about 10 dollars! What excellent prices! If I move to Montreal I will definitely come back here.
5	Enormous selection of asian goods. Great place to gether the necessary stuff for japanese classics such as shabu-shabu, hot pots and other similar meals. Not too costy and the staff is very friendly. Store is very clean and ingredients fresh. Lots of good quality frozen goods; fish, noodles and seafoods.
4	Awesome dumplings and kimchi.
