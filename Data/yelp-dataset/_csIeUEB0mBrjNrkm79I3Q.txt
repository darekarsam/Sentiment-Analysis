1	overpriced and arrogant. they claim they specialize in repairing designer shoes giving them carte blanche to charge outrageous prices and return your shoes back with mediocre repair quality. despicable.
5	Shoe Lab on Polairis in Las Vegas is the best.  I have been sending my designer shoes, handbags, and belt there for years.  The owner Jerry is very helpful an the staff too.  They are really great at tailoring boots to fit the leg.
5	In the past, I've had bad experiences with shoe repair services. I recently went to Shoe Lab with a pair of boots that had worn out soles and a couple of studs missing. At that point, I had given up all hope on any other repairs other than the left cracked sole. When I got my shoes back, I was more than surprised that Shoe Lab not only replaced the cracked sole but had replaced the other sole to match and the missing studs had been replaced with something almost identical to it. I was pleased with the service.
