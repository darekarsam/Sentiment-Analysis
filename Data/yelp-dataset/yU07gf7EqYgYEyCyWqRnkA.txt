4	Dj is cool. The place needs a theme ASAP
4	Great spot to drink and lounge and play games.  I saw some Hookahs also, but I didn't partake.  The view in this place is amazing (obviously) and the decor is great.  I was here during half-off drinks so that was a plus.  It wasn't crowded during that time but the later we were there, the more people showed up.  I would assume this is a good place to pre-game before actually hitting a dance club.
3	Simply love The View for what it is, literally. And even better, Saturday nights are Latin Night now, with variety of beats- happens to be my newest digg. Drinks are super pricey, it's a little dark inside/poor lighting. But I suppose if things become a bore you could always take the elevator back down (because they make you go all the way down and then back up) and then take it back up to Moon which is always crackin ;b
2	It was a Wednesday night, the few was great but the bar itself was empty, only a few older ladies shaking on the dance floor, drinks were about 15 bucks each, bartenders not very friendly, not rude, just short with you. I guess i would be too if I worked at a has-been bar.
4	Awesome view, happy hour till 11pm. Pool tables, hookah service. The place is new, so not the usual vegas busy crowds. And did I mention the view from the 52nd floor of the Palm Hotel. The hookah was ok, but overall experience is pretty pleasant.
