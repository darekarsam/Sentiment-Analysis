5	Such a pleasure to have delicious vegetarian options in Urbana! I had the black bean and tempeh tacos with a quinoa corn side dish. Delish!
5	I visited The Dancing Dog this evening, had an excellent meal, and the service was wonderful as well. The staff are very friendly, and everything on the menu (including the wine) is 100% vegan. I had the vegan fish and chips. I think the vegan fish pieces (there were three) are Sophie's Choice brand, and they are deep fried, so if you are looking for vegan health food, this might not be the dish for you. However, if you want the closest thing I've ever tasted to British-style fish and chips, this would be it. The tartar sauce was tasty and the coleslaw was some of the best I've had anywhere. For dessert, I ordered the chocolate chocolate chip, cookie, which was also excellent. Dense and chocolatey, slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.I will definitely visit here again the next time I'm in Urbana. Any vegans and vegetarians in town should feel lucky to have this wonderful restaurant.
5	Sooo good!!! The  desserts are unreal and they're healthy!!! It's a must to stop by this local gem. Don't leave Urbana without doing so!
5	Wonderful vegan food! The tacos, quinoa salad, bruschetta and hummus are all delicious! The desserts; specifically the mousse was great. The wait staff was very friendly. Whether vegan or carnivore this place is a great spot.
5	Excellent....long overdue...Not over the top VEGAN, but this place is great for those that are a little "itchy" about vegan food. Changed my mind..while I still enjoy beef,chicken,etc. This place makes a really healthy plate. I was really surprised how tasty it was. Friends are vegan, I was skeptical..but the taco was outstanding...and I didn't miss a thing ordering it.  Great little hidden gem.....
4	Fresh squeezed juices! Thank you for delivering healthy options. Nice cozy spot to get some lunch and work done.
