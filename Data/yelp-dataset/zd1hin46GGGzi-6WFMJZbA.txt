5	I needed tires and rims swapped. Called around and their price was competitive. They did the job fairly quick. Next time I went the price was even cheaper. Will continue to go here cuz I trust them.
5	I got a flat on the side of the freeway.  This place had me up and running within 35 minutes.   They were honest and fair and very helpful I will definitely use these guys again.
1	Was very disappointed with their online inventory not being current. I called about replacing a specific tire and was told they had it. The tire that was mounted on my rim was not the one I requested and was a no name tire with dry rot around the rim. Will never return.
