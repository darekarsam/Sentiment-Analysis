4	Newly opened on Waterloo Place, Pep and Fodder, from the team that brought you the Bon Vivant, is a smart and stylish city centre cafe. The cous cous salad I sampled was beautifully seasoned, packed with flavour and a complete riot of palette pleasing joy.Overall, we said: "So I was very pleased with Pep and Fodder. It certainly merits a return visit, once they've had a chance to bed-in a little more, and once they have their soup on the go. It has a nice array of cakes and pastries, too, so it may well be worthy of a visit from our Cake Questing friends soon, too. I'd heartily recommend you pop in, next time you find yourself at the east end of Princes Street."
5	Very, very friendly, good lattes, nice croissants and pastries.  We stopped back im after a few days and the staff remembered us and asked how our trip has been. Very charming atmosphere, kind folks, good teas and great vibe.
4	great addition to the central cafe scene.  I work nearby and despair of Starbucks etc.  P&F provides a nice relaxed space with great food and coffee, and friendly service.  I feel strongly about the need to support such places but this is a place that I would come to anyway because its great.  I thought the pastries were fresh.  The paninis were interesting and packed with flavour.  Above all for me, the benchmark, great flat white.
