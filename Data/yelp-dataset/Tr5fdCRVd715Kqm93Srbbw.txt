3	This Jiffy Lube is tucked back on Matthews-Mint Hill Rd (across the street from Carolina Lanes).  I went here on a Friday afternoon (mostly as a last resort- but that's a different story in-itself)... but they weren't busy at all.The attendants were all nice.  The part I hated was them trying to sell me all these different services when all I needed was an oil change.  I was already in a crabby mood since the place I normally go to turned me away (in a sketchy fashion), but I was in and out of this Jiffy Lube in about 20min.The prices for there services are on the "high roller" side, but they did give my car a vacuum and wiped down the windows while the oil was draining out of it.Would I come back?  Probably... but they have to do something about their prices to make their services more appealing to the wallet.
1	These guys did an oil change and managed to spill antifreeze all over the belts. They also insisted that my battery was bad. After a quick trip to my Honda dealer, it was confirmed that my battery was fine and Juffy Lube used the wrong setting to gage the battery. I tried to tell the Jiffy staff, but they were not interested. Jiffy Lube insisted they were right. Beware of these guys. You may not need what they offer. They cost me a lot of lost time. The car had a bad odor for a long time from the spilled antifreeze.
1	Expensive (more than dealership), not fast, and they REALLY do some up-selling.
2	Although the service was quick and courteous, I was stunned that an oil change was $75. I was given a "ladies day" discount of $10, so it was $65 but that still seems very high. They wiped down my windows and vacuumed the mats, totally unnecessary, and left lots of streaks on the windows. I would have preferred to have lower cost and just had an oil change. I won't be back.
