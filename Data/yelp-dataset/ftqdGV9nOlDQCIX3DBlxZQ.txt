3	While Fairtrade is in theory a good idea, I can't seem to shake the feeling that the main purpose of shops like this is not in fact to improve economic practices in developing countries, but to give Guardian readers something to brag about at dinner parties. Whereas a charity shop can seem sweet, genuine and homely, One World Shop is very much a lifestyle accessory store for those who hide their ravenous obsession with wealth and status behind a veil of Indian pan-pipe music and hummus.In all fairness the toys do look really cute and well-made, though everything else seems to me a bit soulless. It's not really my kind of place at all but if you're into the whole right-on thing you'll probably lap it up, and be able to find a nice wooden ornament to beat your Indonesian housekeeper with later on.
