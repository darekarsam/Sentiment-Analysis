5	More like a super bed and breakfast than 5 star hotel, but regardless, it did not disappoint. Staff was amazing. They gave us free laundry and breakfast! Great location too. The room was full of amenities. Love this place.
5	so beautiful and suitable place. Really worth it! It's the best one among hotels which have the comparative price!! Love it!!!!
5	Located between the parallels of St Catherine  and Rene Levesque the chateau St Marc worked out perfectly for my 4 day stay in Montreal. I entered the building and I was greeted by the hotel manager who led me up a flight of stairs through a kitchen and up to a spiral stair case that led to my room. It was definitely an unorthodox pathway to anything let alone a hotel room. She opens the door and I see this huge kitchen/dinette area with a hot tub. I thought wow this is a lot. She took me thru an adjacent door which led to the bedroom portion which was a very clean and spacious living quarter. It was probably too much for my relatively short stay but this place doesn't lack in amenities. The staff of I believe two were very friendly and made sure all my needs were met. I highly recommend this place it's reasonable and it's in a solid location. If and when I come back to montreal I would certainly stay here again!
