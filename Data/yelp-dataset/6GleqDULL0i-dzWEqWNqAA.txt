5	They came out and were very upfront and honest and fixed things as soon as possible.
5	Johnny's came to our rescue on a Sunday morning in the heat of the summer. Called him and was at my house assessing the problem with in an hour.  I Highly recommend Johnny and his crew for anything with repairing your ac unit. He does not do installs or sales, but does do honest repair work.
5	Johnny is the real deal!He saved me last week when my tenant's AC went out.  He was very upfront and honest about my situation and suggested that I get a new ac rather than use his help to repair.  He doesn't sell AC units so he was sacrificing making more money from me for the betterment of the situation.  REALLY?!  What a great guy!   He even followed up with me a couple times to be sure I was getting a good price on the new unit I found.I have 10 properties in the valley that constantly need updating and help. I will be keeping Johnny's number on my speed dial in case another AC issue comes up again.  I HIGHLY recommend him if you're looking for honest help.  Oh, and I should mention he came out to rescue my tenants AC on a Sunday!  This guy takes no days off.  Incredible!
