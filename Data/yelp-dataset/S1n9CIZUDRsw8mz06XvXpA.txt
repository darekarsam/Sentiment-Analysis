4	Whenever kiddo needs a new pair of shoes, we pop into this Famous Footwear location to buy a pair.  He likes this location because of it's close proximity to ASU and he says "Dad, the scenery is better at this mall".....he's 15 and full of hormones.The place is clean and offers a nice selection of shoes.  That's why we come here...for the shoes, right?http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/famous-footwear-tempe-2?select=wht5FaGi7r86WKW7-VX2lQ#wht5FaGi7r86WKW7-VX2lQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/famous-footwear-tempe-2?select=e3KKBu1H7Z9pMEe8NQqXfg#e3KKBu1H7Z9pMEe8NQqXfghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/famous-footwear-tempe-2?select=JgxxmRjkyBxDH2-6mlLQlQ#JgxxmRjkyBxDH2-6mlLQlQReturn Factor - 100% (at least until kiddo graduations from HS)
5	Bought 2 months ago a pair of super comfortable sketchers for work. I kept forgetting  to write this review and I totally forgot the name of the ladies who helped me. I bought the wrong size in the store, went back and they ordered the size I needed and said they will mail it to my home. They did and a lot sooner than expected. I really liked the customer service and they have 5 start from me.
4	I really , really, really wish the Mesa Riverview store was still open but this store is just as good. I mean, its a chain store where they are all pretty much the same, right? The people that work here are nice and helpful. My only complaint is that it is in Tempe Marketplace and the parking sucks. Especially since this is right next to the uber-busy Target.
5	Manager Alex is really a good manager.  He honored a price mix-up for me, when really he didn't have to. I was in a hurry and not in the best mood, but he looked past it and made everything exceptional. I will definitely go to this location again. I hope this comment is reviewed by upper management. Alex is qualified to run this store!
5	I love shoes but most importantly I love great customer service! The employees are awesome!! The manager, Gina, is WONDERFUL!!!
