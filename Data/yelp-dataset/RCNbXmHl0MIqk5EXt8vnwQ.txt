5	Call Debbie for help is all I can say! She will help with any credit issue. She has integrity and will not charge you for BS.
5	Call Debbie! Hands down the best move I did for my credit situation. You will walk away feeling confident, directed, and focused, with  a real affirmative plan of action. Debbie gives you all of that and more... My credit score is making its way up the charts in a short amount of time if you just follow her direction...
5	Before the help from Debbie, I had some items that were not reporting accurately with the credit reporting agencies.  She worked with each of them to resolve the issues at a resonable price.  Six months later all the issues have been resolved and I'm now a home owner again :-).Thank You Debbie!!!
