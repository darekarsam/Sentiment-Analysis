5	Well, I'm a little biased being that I'm one of the members here; but seriously Eye Lounge exhibits some of the better up and coming artists in town.  A little plug for myself, come see my show there in November (it's in the west gallery Omer!)  If any of you want a card, email me your address and I will send one right out to ya!
5	I've never been disappointed.I know three members, all superb artists.I wish to be a member some day.Sigh.
4	Always a gallery I hit.  Great space, always interesting art.  I've known many of the artists over the years and have seen practically every exhibit.
5	Great little space. Go see the Christopher Jagmin show right now!!! His colorful, slightly loopy encaustic paintings are a great reminder that life is fun, dammit, and art can be too!
4	Love stopping in here on First Fridays. Usually love the pieces here. I really liked the piece in the tiny back room during the March FF. It made a great statement in a new way on our weight obsessed culture.
4	favorite of First Friday galleries - diverse blend of approachable and provocative art, nice representation of local/foreign artists. enjoyed west lounge entirely dedicated to Logan Bellow's "Theories" exhibit.
5	One of my favorite Art Galleries on Roosevelt Row, a mandatory monthly stop for me.
