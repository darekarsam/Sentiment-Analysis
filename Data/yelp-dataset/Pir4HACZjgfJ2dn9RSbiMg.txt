5	Super friendly and accommodating staff.  Their quality of work is outstanding too.   Even their basic pedicure was impressive and very relaxing. Very happy and impressed with this location!
1	This place is very dirty! The floors, tables, brushes, even the portable uv gel light was filthy! You could literally see grim, disgusting! I also saw one lady pour some liquid into the nail polish a few times before she used it on me. The outcome of the nails seemed rushed and careless. For the price, they needed to be much better. I'm sad to say but, I can't go back. The cleanliness was out of control, and the work was terrible.
