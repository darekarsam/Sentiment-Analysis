1	I have no idea how this place is still open...  The pork fried rice was horrible, I'm not even sure that it was pork.  Maybe it was pork, either way I wouldn't have known because there was more fat than meat.  If a chinese place can't do fried rice right, one is left to wonder what they can do right.
5	The rice was great when I was there and so was the rest of my meal. Excellent curry. Exellent egg rolls. A have used Happy Garden for dine in and delivery and have had nothing but good experiences. Best to try it for yourself. Not sure what happened for David there, but you can't judge everything by one experience.
1	If you like overcooked, terrible, chinese food, delivered by a stoner, when he can eventually find your house after an hour, this is the place! Next time I'll just drive to the Panda Express.  I think Greg E owns or works for the place.
1	rice was mushy, fried shrimp was dark when I bit into it egg roll was the same way. quit eating it after a few bites and still  woke up sick. would definitely stay away
