1	After having the transmission replaced in my husband's 1979 Dodge Power Wagon, the truck has been back to this shop three times for leaking transmission fluid. Having paid almost $2K and having taken it back multiple times to have it made right, they will not make any further repairs and even threatened to call the cops if we came back to the shop. Their incompetence to get the job handled correctly as well as verbally abusing my husband has made this a true horror story. Not once did my husband raise his voice, make threats or cuss however he was called multiple explicit terms by Rodman, the owner, and was hung up on. We simply wanted what we paid for or a refund and instead we were called names, not given any kind of refund and on top of it the transmission still leaks. Ironically it wasn't leaking when we first brought it in. Do not go here unless you want to overpay for shoddy workmanship from rude people who won't back their own written warranty.

1	23 months after paying almost $2000 for a transmission rebuild I lost 3rd gear.  I took the truck in to them and they said I was 70 miles over the 24000 mile warranty.  I didnt expect a free rebuild but they wanted the full $2000 again.  Dougs is right next door...give Dougs your business!
