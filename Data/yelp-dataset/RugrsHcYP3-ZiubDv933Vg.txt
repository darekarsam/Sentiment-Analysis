4	Always on time with my cleaning and really nice folks at the front counter.
4	Go see "D" and Tracy at this place. They will take care of you!
4	I am proud to call this business "my dry cleaners" and highly recommend their services. A couple weeks ago, I had my very first dry cleaning experience (typically someone else had taken it for me). Tracy and team have made the process painless and rewarding. I dropped off my blazer and was told that there would be a turnaround of just one day - fabulous! Then, they were more than happy to deliver it to my office when I realized I wouldn't have time to stop in for another few days! Best service EVER. I have a closet full of "dry clean only" sweaters that I've been neglecting, but now I'm actually excited to take it to the cleaners!
1	I have been here twice and both times was a poor experience. If you don't point out a stain they miss it. The tailoring was sloppy, and the merchandise in the store was overpriced. Stay Away
