3	Well, after having a pretty terrible experience at Maki of Japan at the northlake food court, I was eager to try Yeung's to see if their Asian food is any better. Better, yes, is it much better no?I got the singapore noodle and the lo-mein. The lo-mein tasted like soy sauce, the flavor was not impressive. THe singapore noodle while greasy lacks salt, i was seriously about to walk back and get a couple packets of salt for my noodle. The price  here is $6.10 for a 1 entree with 1 side plate. Spring rolls are $1.32...Soups are like $1.50. The price is not bad, not much different than Maki. They accept credit card but not American express.
3	First of all, I have no idea who Yeung is. Then again, I don't know who Leng is either. Hey, I don't even know who McDonald was. But I like all of them. But I'd put Mr. Leng in front of Mr. Yeung if I had to compare them. Well, they used to be good. Their General T'sao and Lo Mein-ish noodle was really good.Now, the noodle's drier and the chicken is just too sweet/spicy. But it's still ok. The location isn't the best though. Do keep in mind that this is inside a mall. One is in Northlake Mall and the other is in Concord Mills mall. The one at Northlake is in a fairly okay food court. But the Concord Mills food court can get a bit weird. IDK. Anyway, it's good enough to go try it.
5	This place has delicious food! At least what I get! I love the fact that the chicken is real! I am very picky about the food I eat. The employees there are always pleasant. No over the top friendliness or smiles, but never funky or bad attitudes. I ordered tyre 2 messy entree. It it's like $7 and some change. Give them a shot! You will enjoy it!
