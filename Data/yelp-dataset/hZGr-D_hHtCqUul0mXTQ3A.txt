3	With only one review to go on (since the airport location is brand new), I read reviews from the Gilbert location to decide whether to try this place. The reviews were favorable overall, so we figured we'd give it a shot. We lived in Houston for almost 9 years, so we're very particular about our brisket. Theirs is tender, but honestly it tastes like pot roast. It's good pot roast, but still disappointing if you expect to taste brisket. They have two sauces: "hot" (i.e. not hot), and mild. Neither has any real oomph, but they are edible. I was wary when I saw the comglomeration of beans in the baked beans-lima, kidney, pinto, etc. I've never heard of doing that. However, they were surprisingly good and were probably the highlight of my meal. Normally I hate lima beans, but I have found out I can eat them when prepared in this fashion. My husband's potato salad had large pieces of potato and was pretty decent. The cole slaw doesn't have much flavor, so I wouldn't get that again. We each had a freshly-made strawberry lemonade. I asked for light ice, and they seemed like they went out of their way to cram as much ice in as possible. All in all, not bad, yet not memorable. Three stars seems like the most fitting rating here.
5	Just like Joes without the drive to Gilbert! Brisket sandwich was very good. They were out of a lot of meats which was not good. Friendly staff made up for it! Nice option
4	Solid BBQ especially considering its in an airport. Mac & cheese is very good. Service is fast and friendly. Price is very reasonable. Portions are generous.
1	Epic failure! I got in line with one couple in front of me. After watching 3 employees spend almost 15 minutes trying to make a salad and weigh out a pulled pork sandwich like they were selling gold I walked away. It's an airport and people have places to go. I called the real Joe's BBQ and was told that they frequently get complaints about this location but sadly it's owned by somebody else.
