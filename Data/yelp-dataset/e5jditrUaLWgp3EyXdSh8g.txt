3	I wanted to let everyone know that I received an arrangement as a gift. I wasn't home the first time they delivered. They brought it back after I called the number on the card they left. They were very nice!  I would have given them 5 stars but a little of the fruit (the strawberries were not fully ripe.This arrangement is pricey so all fruit should be excellent. No exceptions!So...if you send one to someone just tell them when ordering..."Please be sure all fruit that you use is ripe and excellent"We deserve what we pay for for :))Other than that it was very pretty and a joy to receive!
4	Too much yummy things in here...it's a good thing I'm not a big sweets person...picking up my arrangement since I wasn't home for the delivery...so much for surprising me huh lol...
