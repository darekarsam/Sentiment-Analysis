5	I live in the birthplace of In-N-Out, so trying out other, regional burger places often leaves me sad. But Cook Out is the real deal. Their burgers taste like..... beef. And the fries taste like ....spuds. That shouldn't be a revelation but it was wonderful to enjoy a simple meal done right.And the chocolate, walnut shake made for a delicious, unexpected surprise.I'm comin' back Cook Out. I gotta try a burger Cheddar style.2013 #160 / 365
5	This is a good location they have prompt service and great food like the cookout chain is known for!
3	The food is always good, the service,  not so much. There were 4 of us in the car, the lady taking out orders keep interrupting us and would not let use give her all the complete order. She also keep talking to other people in the store. Add to it all SHE did not get our order quiet right!
