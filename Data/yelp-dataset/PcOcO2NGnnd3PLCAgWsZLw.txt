4	I was a huge fan of the Avalon in Oakland a couple years so when I passed this in Mt Lebo I had to stop! Design: Eye catching, funky clothes in the windows, neon signOrganization: Typical layout of most buy trade sell shops. Pants. Shirts. Dresses...yada yada.  Nice area upfront with bags and jewelry. There is also a higher end selection( Prada, Gucci, Jimmy Cho) for the desperate housewives of Mt. Lebo. Selection: Pretty good. Buffalo Exchange has a more stylish/funky selection though. Wide Shoe Selection. Price: Affordable Service: Cashier was nice. We briefly chatted about our favorite stores. Pros: Doesn't smell like cat pee which most resell shops tend to. Very Organized and great design. Very Affordable ( Tank $8.00 and Dress $8.00) Cons: Could use to clear out some inventory ( old Hollister tanks, plaid short short from '98). Whiney mid-aged women shop here. Overall: Great place to stop when you have no money but still have the itch to spend and need a break from the Urban Outfitters circuit. Definitely plan on making this a constant in my shopping rounds.  Check it out!
1	this place sucks. went back with more clothes/purses to sell after lunchtime and found out the only buy in the morning now. hmm when i called the previous morning about what time was good to come in the girl said come whenever i can. plus they try to be "high end" but they are not .. its the same as platos.. with a ruder staff.pass.
