1	Awful place.  Prices are higher than the corner 7-Eleven.  The workers are unhappy.  The manager looked like he hadn't showered and he told his employee to break after working two hours.  I know this because they talked about it while the employee was ringing me up.  :-/. Rude and not worth it.
2	Produce never seems very fresh..Bought some hot dogs and only noticed when we got back they were past the 'use by' date by a couple weeks. Service is alright, but the employees usually seem in a bad mood.
2	They stuff the aisle so full of stuff you can't walk around with a cart without running into displays or other people. Not enough staff to keep the place clean. Checkers try hard to keep the line moving quickly but it leads to carelessness. 3 times I've come home missing bags of items I paid for because they are putting the items from the person behind me on that carousel thing before I have my things out. Please staff your store properly!
3	Dollar General is a discount store. You can find some good deals on some items and there certain products that you're better off leaving on the shelf.  I come here to grab snacks, last minute deodorant,and few odd items . I've managed to find some great deals on a generic version of Cetaphil face wash and facial moisturizer that have both WORKED for me.  The cashier's are pretty friendly and helpful for the most part. No complaints here.
