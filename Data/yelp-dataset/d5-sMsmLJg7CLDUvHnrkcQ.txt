1	If I could rate them lower I would. This is a property run by Mark Taylor Management. It's not a Mark Taylor property. I have felt fooled since the beginning. The management is so non customer service oriented it drove me nuts. They don't work with you as a resident. All you are to them is a $ sign and not a customer. Fidel Castro could probably provide better customer service then they do. It's sad and I would never recommend Mark Taylor to anyone. Go somewhere else like Pillar.

The property is very quiet, clean, and (though a little south in Chandler) fairly convenient with a Safeway next door. The lake near the back of the property is pretty nice and you can usually see several ducks lounging around.I leased a 2nd floor apartment (top floor of the building I was in) and had not seen a single scorpion my whole time there. There were the occasional critters, but nothing crazy. Neighbor noise was never an issue however my apartment faced South Alma School Road, and there was a noticeable amount of street noise (and noise from the baseball fields across the street) from the living room.The staff at the leasing office was helpful and courteous, and the maintenance team was always very prompt and polite. There were even a few instances where the maintenance team stayed after hours to ensure that my apartment was back to working order before they closed up.Everything considered, I would recommend this property to anyone looking for a safe and affordable community in Chandler (and for those looking for a quick commute to the Intel-Ocotillo site).
