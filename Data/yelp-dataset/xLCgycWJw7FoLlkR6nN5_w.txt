1	Now that it has changed hands it's no fun.
4	Excellent ambience! It was clean and quiet. I'm sure this place has a bad rep from the last place that was there...Kahootz? I almost did not go in because of the old bar. I am glad I did, the bartender was friendly. The food was decently priced, nothing much different about the food from any other bar. Would have gotten a 5 if the food was better or different atleast. I would definitely be back.
1	I stopped in on my way home from work not only did they not have my Johnnie  walker scotch but the stake sandwich I ate made me sick for two days! Needless to say I'll never go back and if you know what's good for you should ad void going here at all costs!
5	I would have never ventured in here when it was Kahootz, but they have fixed the place up and have some great bartenders, I always win when I play here, and the service is great.
5	Dont judge this place by the outside . Great ambience and atmosphere inside . Nice and clean. Food is all good . Cheap too $9.99 steak dinner , tons of variety and the appetizers during happy hour are only $5 . Breakfast is served all day . Coldest draft beer you can find in Henderson . All the staff are nice and friendly . If you haven't tried it you should .
4	Food is pretty tasty. Service is really good. No real drinks specials but I love the look of the place and I always win a bit of cash from their video poker.
