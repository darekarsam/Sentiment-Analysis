1	This store told me they are affiliated with UPS in name only. When I took a return there the woman I spoke with rudely insisted I buy a $25 box before they would take my item. They do not understand the concept of customer service and it may cause them to lose their business base. I am now using the store on Regent St.
5	It's too bad this store has such a bad review from one customer. I have had two positive experiences with customer service here - one woman gave me a helpful tip to cut down printing costs. And if you want cheap printing for course readings - ups was nearly half the cost of fed ex and much less than office max it was kind of unbelievable. Glad I called around first!
