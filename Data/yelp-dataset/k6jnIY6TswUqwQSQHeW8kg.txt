4	This location just opened. It's in a weird spot next to a car rental place so there's not a lot of parking. Once you get inside you will find it is very spacious, and clean too like a new restaurant would be. Other than that it's a typical Port of Subs.When I walked in the staff was very friendly and welcoming. They do no skimp at all with regards to sandwiches, you get all the meat, cheese, and veggies you pay for. They are a bit slow but many employees are new, so be patient. But it's a new store so I'm sure they'll work all that out.
4	This is a very spacious and clean location. The staff are super friendly - way more so than the staff at Valle Verde location.  The downside is that parking is tight in this busy little lot next to hertz and 7-11. The meat is sliced to order, they are generous with meat and toppings, and they have a whole wheat option. I love that!
5	Love this place! So much better than Subway; the ingredients are fresh and they cut the meat and cheese right there. It gives it that deli taste that you don't get from precut meat. A lunch go-to from now on!
