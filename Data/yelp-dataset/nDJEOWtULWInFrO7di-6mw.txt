5	I'm hesitant to write about Salon Boheme for fear of not getting an appointment when it get's overbooked.Leigh is the owner and solo stylist at this sweet place and she gives GREAT cuts. Her best attributes are that she is not scissor happy and she takes her time to make sure that she's giving you the cut you want. Her hair cuts are an interactive experience that end in great results. I should add that Leigh is fun to talk to and the salon is a totally comfortable experience. If she was in another city, her services would fetch top dollar and here in PGH she's a bargain.*Also, I almost forgot, she does eyebrow waxing too and is GREAT.
4	Great service, such a welcoming environment!  My cut and style were fantastic and the price for services are unbeatable in Shadyside!!  Highly recommend trying this place out if you are new to the area or looking to branch out.
5	Everything that the first two gals said. I found Leigh "shearly" by accident, through a friend who was working nearby, made an appointment, and loved her. For my part, I'd been cutting my own hair through the summer, and that was fine and dandy when you're doing yard work and you want your hair to be 2" all over. But then I tried restoring my previous asymmetrical 'do and all I can say is 'don't.' Anyhow, my hair was a mess when I got to Leigh. It was an interactive experience as C.K. mentioned, and I walked out feeling both human and female again. Definitely going back!!
