5	Best spray tan ever! I'm so pasty white and my glow was so natural and very even never came off spotty.  I'm so impressed. She said she uses the best bronzing agents! Couldn't be happier:) Thank you Denise!
5	Just got my very first spray tan! Denise really took care of me and told me all that I need to know, how to prepare for it and how to take care of it to get my tan to stay as long as possible. I definitely recommend this to everyone!! She really knows what she's doing!!
5	I am a repeat customer at D's Spray Tanning because it is so AMAZING!  The tan really does last 7 days just like I was told.  The tanning space is very clean and Denise makes the tan look so natural and even.  I have been getting spray tanned for years and once I found this place I haven't gone anywhere else.  If you are looking for a longlasting, natural looking tan then make your appointment!  Thanks for keeping me glowing!!
5	I have been to many places  around the Phoenix area for airbrush and mystic tanning, and I've had my share of horror stories as well! As long as this place is here, I won't be going anywhere else! The tan was natural, even and lasted great! :-)
5	Denise is great. I felt super comfortable and the product she uses is the best (that I have experienced). I was pleasantly surprised. I have found my new spray tanning gal!!
