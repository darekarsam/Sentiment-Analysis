4	There is currently a dress in the display of Emma Roy that's making girls and women stop and admire its fabulousness! My friend and I oggle it every time we walk past, and were starting to feel alone in it's fan group where a she-group of 5 stopped and took pictures (so have I, which I've uploaded). These wedding dress shops are quite devilish, as they make the most unfussed girl such as myself actually THINK about a wedding! Apart from the wonderful wedding dress, Emma Roy also sells bridesmaid and evening gowns, and offers other wedding services such as photography, venue help and will even fix up your teeth for you - how bizarre!
