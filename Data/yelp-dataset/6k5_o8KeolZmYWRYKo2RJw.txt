5	Just got my hair cut today and what a great experience. Charming building, Great cut at a terrific value. I got my hair cut a little shorter for the warmer weather and Patrick got it perfect. I was on a break from work and time was critical. I was in and out and most importantly got a shampoo after the cut so wouldn't have hair down my shirt! Saving the best for last...shoulder and back massage afterward, then on my way back to work much more relaxed. Top notch salon. I highly recommend it!
5	Love this place! I have been going to Kelsa for two years now and I won't go anywhere else! She even squeezes me in for a style  when she is booked!
