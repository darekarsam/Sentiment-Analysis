5	This was my first time at Massage Envy.  It was wonderful!  I called the day before and was able to book an appt no problem.  I was helped immediately when I arrived, got my paperwork filled out, and got to sit in the tranquility room while I waited for my appt to start.Racheal did an excellent job!  I had so many knots and she worked hard to get them out and to make me feel better.  I was comfortable the entire 90 minutes.  The environment is relaxing.  I would definitely recommend her.Checkout was a breeze with Racheal giving me suggestions on what I can do at home to help and how often I should return.  I felt no pressure to sign up for their membership club.  They explained it quickly and understood that I could not afford it at this time.
4	I always look forward to my monthly appointments with Alyssa. By far she is one of the top massage therapists I've been to In a while. She knows what she's doing and I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a great massage!!
2	If you want a great consistently great massage, KEEP LOOKING. The great therapists stay only until they get a real job that pays them more than $15/massage, and then they're gone. I was stuck with 3 more massages on my stupid 6 month contract and the good therapists were gone (OH! And DO NOT GET BULLIED INTO BUYING CONTRACTS HERE!). I wanted to give one of the massages to my daughter, so they charged me $15 to PUT MY PREPAID MASSAGE NOW INTO HER NAME. $15 for the NAME CHANGE! And when my daughter didn't WANT said massage from them because she too has experienced HORRIBLE massages there, they wanted to change me ANOTHER $15 to put it BACK into MY NAME. What is wrong with you!?!??! Wow I needed a massage AFTER dealing with them! HORRIBLE! I walked from the last 3 massages cuz IT WASN'T WORTH MY TIME.
