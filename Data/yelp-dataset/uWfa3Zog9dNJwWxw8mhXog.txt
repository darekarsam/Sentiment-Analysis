5	When I see this truck my mouth starts quiverI am so addicted to the Taco Nauts I can just think about them and I get a little happier where ever I am.Really The BEST.Just the right amount of crunchy, saucy, mmmmmm o h yeah.I am getting flush just writing this...Where is that RoboDUCK truck!
4	If you believe in reincarnation, come see what the flying monkey has become.Formerly the Flying Monkey Truck, the Robo Duck Truck has the same fusion menu and font/color design. I'm pretty sure it has the same menu too. When I saw them at the Sunset Park'd food truck festival today, I knew I had to get the Taco-nauts again.The Taco-nauts ($5) are four pieces of crispy wonton, each topped with a bed of sushi rice, a chunk of grilled miso salmon, and a drizzle of spicy mayo and eel sauce. I thought the food came out a little cold, but the flavor was still as good as I remember it from last time. This is a great appetizer and a treat to share between friends, so if you see them at a food truck gathering, stop here first.Perhaps I'll finally try another of their offerings next time. Kurobuta udon sounds nice because kurobuta is always a treat.
