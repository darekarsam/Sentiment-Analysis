5	This place was my savior when my washing machine packed in between Christmas and New Year. A time of year when repairs do not happen quickly because everyone is too busy eating, drinking and being merry. And quite rightly so! So I hurried in here with a bag full of washing and the nice lady took it off me and told me to come back the next day. When I went back everything was cleaned and folded perfectly. It was like having my mum do my laundry again! I used the launderette a couple of times afterward, and occasionally when I come back from a trip and can't be chewed washing and drying a suitcase of clothes. Every time the clothes come back clean (which is the main thing I guess!) and nicely folded. It is nice to have folded laundry now and again! This place always has bags and bags full of nicely folded laundry, so I guess it is pretty popular and I can see why.
