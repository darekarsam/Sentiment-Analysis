5	Needed a plumper to fix a leaky disposal and found CSI on Yelp.  With no reviews I was a bit worried but I read the owner Dwayne's info and decided to give him a try.  On telephone I was further reassured by his no nonsense professional style.  Made an appointment for two days later and he arrived 10 minutes early!  He set to work, explained what he was doing, and charged us what he promised.  Quick, efficient, honest and reliable!  What more can you ask for?
5	Very nice and friendly. Affordable. All I needed was my water softener checked, so glad I found them instead of paying these other companies $50-150! for someone to just look at my equipment.
