5	Great little park. I run or walk around the small path, a few times a week. There's a small playground for kids, tennis courts, basketball, two baseball fields. There's and a small workout section. Most days it's pretty quiet unless the little league has set up shop (usually Wednesday around 5pm or 6pm)On most weekends you'll find families staking out the lone grill. But if you can keep a secret there's actually a small grill off to the side near a singular table. Tonight there was a kid practicing the clarinet. I'm not sure how good he was, as I had my Pandora turned up.
5	Perfect little hidden park where you or your family can enjoy themselves playing, bbqing, or just relaxing. Only setback is there are no bathrooms.
3	I came here to check out this park before my daughter starts soccer practice here next week. The playground area is pretty janky and small. It is missing steps connecting the two areas, leaving just empty poles. That's a safety issue. There is graffiti on the climbing wall as well. Grassy area looks decent. Seems to be popular with dog owners. No bathrooms. The kids are having fun, for what it's worth.
