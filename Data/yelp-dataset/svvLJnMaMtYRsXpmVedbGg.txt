4	I have a wonderful time here, i just moved April 15th! so far its quiet for a night shift person to sleep during the day. The staff is always happy to assist you with your maintenance problems and other issues you might have. The apartment i got  is a one Bedroom 595sqft place. its a good size for a 1 person , washer and dryer is including in every unit.  I love the stainless steel appliances that it comes with. although im used to having a storage place for the extra sesonal stuff. This unit does  not have one on site, unless you purchase one. Internet and Basic Cox channels are available for $35 extra a month.. which is not bad..considering i was paying 60$ for just internet... now i get basic with the same speed of internet i was getting. So I can order HBO to watch games of Thrones for the regualr 15$ extra. Not bad !! So if you choice you live here, I recommend it, not bad space and perks you get here. overall! 4 stars , would of been 5 if it had a storage place on the unit!
