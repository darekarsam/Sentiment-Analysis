2	I had high hopes since this place is located in the same building as my gym and next door to my office.  But after two attempts, it's not likely that I'll return.  If there's a line, plan on waiting.  It's slow.  On the first trip I ordered the chicken sandwich special.  It tasted like a frozen piece of flavorless chicken on an enormous bun.  On the second visit I figured a salad would be a safe bet but the greek salad had little substance and the dressing was tart.  It tasted like red wine vinegar.  And I was hungry when I left!
4	I have worked in Southpark for over a year and just noticed this little cafe tucked within an office building in Colonial Plaza beside of ZX Fitness.  I had the Southwest chicken wrap and thought it was great.  Fast service too.
5	Great breakfast place. Quick and friendly service. Good food and prices. They have lunch as well which I will be trying out soon.
5	Food is exceptional! Being a foodie as well as a local business owner, I search for local establishments that have great product/service. Park Central is in this category. The food is fresh, well prepared, affordable, and even when there is a line, you will be in and out within 5 minutes. Great job Mark and thanks for the great service. Also, order the buffalo wing wrap with ranch and the pasta salad, awesome stuff!
