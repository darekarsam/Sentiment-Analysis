5	Flying from Long Beach to LV takes about and hour and I didn't want to wait an hour for a rent a car shuttle and then get mistreated by the airport rental companies.  So I took a taxi from the airport for about 20 bucks to this Avis franchise at the mall in the Sears auto center. I am so glad that I did. Kristine at the desk was great. I was in my car, a clean new Fusion, in about 15 minutes. After returning the car Christine happily got me a ride back to my convention hotel. I highly recommend this Avis location as an alternative to renting at the LV airport.
5	I am impressed! You deal with the owner at this location and he is great!  Picked me up at the shop where my car was being fixed even though he was busy.  Price was much lower than Enterprise in the same neighborhood.  No high pressure up-selling and the rental process was fast.  I rent a lot of cars and will rent from here again!
5	I have been in sales and running a business for many years. I took a vacation to Las Vegas for the first time. I looked for the best price, and found that plus the best customer service. Jody and his Wife Christine were the best in the business. They went above and beyond to take care of all my needs. I used a website to get a promo code for the best price. Once I arrived my vehicle was gassed up and ready to go. We saw a convertible on the lot and it was reserved, Christina informed us it would be available the next day. We went back in the morning upgraded, they offered a even better deal because we upgraded. I posted a picture of the car, we drove it to the Grand Canyon. When we dropped off the car Jody drove us to the airport. All i can say is great service, HUGE savings amazingly nice cars! Thank you Jody and Christina, God Bless you.Jason Russell
