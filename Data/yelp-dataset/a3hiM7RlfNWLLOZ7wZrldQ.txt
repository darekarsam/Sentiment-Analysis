5	This has been my Eye Doc for about 2-years.I have tried many over the years, but I have never encountered an entire staff so warm, welcoming, and helpful. It is a true pleasure to visit them (even though it involves a 45min trip to the dreaded "west side" of town). They have a great selection of frames, reasonable prices, quick turn-around, and the nicest people you will fine anywhere. Michael Berger is an experienced optometrist who is passionate about helping people.*My last visit I bought some cool new frames at Paris Optic and they put the lenses in for me here.
5	I've been going here for a couple of years now and the doctor and staff here are as nice as can be. I also like that I see the same people every time I come in.I've never had a problem with ordering my glasses or contacts and the staff is really good at answering any questions you have regarding your plan.I'm really glad this place is close to me... it sucks driving when your eyes are dilated.
4	I came here because they were the only in network place I could go to that's open on Saturdays which is nice for someone who works Monday through Friday. The only thing about going in there is that you smell cleaning solution that is good for a doctor office, but then they go get food for lunch and both of those smells together make you wanna puke. The doctor and staff are very nice!
