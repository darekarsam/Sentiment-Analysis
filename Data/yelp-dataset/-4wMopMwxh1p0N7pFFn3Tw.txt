5	really tasty food, spicy but not mouth numbingly hot! delivery usually isnt the quickest, i would recommend the chicken doro wat and the yassa, the onion wraps are yummy too the only things i would avoid is anything with the shrimp in it as it did have quite an odd flavour ( even though i love shellfish) definitely give this place a try
5	excellent food!
4	Jerk chicken and coconut rice were both really good. Only let down was the hour and a half wait. I'd order again but do it further in advance next time!
