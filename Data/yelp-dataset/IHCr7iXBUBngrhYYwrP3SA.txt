5	This gym is great. They are open 24 hours and offer personal training by Eileen Jones. She is very knowledgable and she works around any injuries I may have. I have become leaner and stronger!
5	Huge place, friendly trainers.  Eileen is great personal trainer and switches it up so that it's not the sam all the time and not boring.  I was wielding a sledge hammer one day!  They are open 24-7 and have some crazy equipment.
