4	I hired Blossom Basket for my wedding flowers.  The person I met with initially was Carla, and she was very professional and experienced.  She was patient and helpful as I struggled to figure out my flower design.  The second time I went in, I was paired with a different employee.  She was young, and perhaps inexperienced, but also very difficult to work with.  She didn't like any of my ideas and just didn't seem to want to work with me to find a solution if my ideas weren't going to work.  She was rude and short with me at times.  For the final consultation, I made sure to request Carla, and all was right with the world!  The flowers turned out great, and compared with the other places I looked at, they were very reasonably priced.
5	Used them for my wedding. Brittany was perfect and patient with me being a picky indecisive bride. When I was able to view my flowers the day before I got teary eyed. Everything came out well. My colors matched perfectly (even my dream lavender roses!!!) and her suggestions for accents were perfect (esp since I had no clue how to pick flowers)
2	Not crazy about this place.
5	Placed an order from so many miles aways,  and was so specific on the type of look I wanted for this Bday arrangement. Had a very tight window time frame for delivery and everything was right on time. Most importantly.. When my sister sent me a pic of what the flowers looked like,  they were beautiful and exactly what I had pictured. Happy customer :)
5	great experience with Theresa on the phone. very helpful getting a wedding bouquet to dearest friends from 2000 miles away.
