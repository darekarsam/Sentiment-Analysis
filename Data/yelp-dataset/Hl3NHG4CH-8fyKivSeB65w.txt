4	Located next to 5 Guys with several young ladies who greet you with a smile and a handshake I've always liked the idea of SportClips, this new location far more appealing than others with several screens showing college football while you wait.  A bit isolated from Downtown Summerlin proper but far more convenient for parking as a result I are myself coming here often.  Good price, friendly service, and sports - no complaints from me.
4	SportClips sent a mass mailing to area residents before their opening for a free haircut with MVP experience.  What's not to like.  This is about 1/2 mile from where I live so it's very convenient.I was greeted promptly and signed in.  After a very short wait, Ofelia called my name and in I went for my haircut.  The sports theme is everywhere.  Supplies, including vacuums for cleaning up cut hair, are kept in lockers.  After a few questions about how I wanted my hair cut, Ofelia started working.  When she was done to my satisfaction, I was escorted to the next room where I was seated in a vibrating chair, had hot steamed towel facial, and a great shampoo and scalp massage.  There are two hot towels used during this MVP experience and it's very relaxing.Back in the main area, my cut was finished with back and neck massage with a hand held device.  After some gel and styling, I was ready to check out, tip Ofelia for good service, and be on my way.It's a place to which I'll return.Note:  I corrected the zip code on the business information in an edit sent to Yelp HQ.  I also noted the ? on the map.  The zip code was changed but the map shows the place as being 11 miles away even though the zip is correct.  I sure miss the way you could edit the spot by dragging the ? to the correct location.  Until it's fixed, there's no checking in.
5	I went in for the MVP haircut and Kristen really took care of my nappy hair. She was friendly, not awkward, and overall made me feel welcomed in her chair. I will return!
