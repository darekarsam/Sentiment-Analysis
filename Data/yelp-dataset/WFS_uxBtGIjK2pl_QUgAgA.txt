5	As an apartment complex manager I had been used a previous company for warranty work and would wait and wait and wait. Once the warranty expired I changed companies and couldn't be happier. Not only am I scheduled quickly, in most situations Justin is able to get the needed parts quickly and I no longer wait weeks for a solution.  I will never use anyone else for our appliance repair needs!
5	Highly recommend. Had them out to look at a couple of our Viking appliances before we host a big Thanksgiving dinner next week. Justin was quick, professional and knowledgable. He worked us into his schedule and even gave me a warning call on his way so our barking dogs wouldn't wake up my napping toddler! He was able to figure out the problem on our range and also fixed our temperamental ice dispenser. His tools were neat and organized; he wore a professional uniform with his name embroidered- I felt very comfortable with him in my home. He also gave me some tips on basic maintenance I should do to keep my appliances working well! We are also having him look at a gas dryer at our rental property as well.
5	I have quite a few rentals and have really liked working with Justin.  I have used him for appliance repair for 6 months or a year.  He comes out and gives me an honest evaluation and pricing.  If it is cheaper to buy a new appliance than the repair, he is alway honest and tells me.  I have had bad luck with most appliance repair companies (crazy pricing and dishonesty).  I never worry about that with Justin.
