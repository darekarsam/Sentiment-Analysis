3	Clean, fresh and tasty. A great alternative to McDonald's, with a Root Beer option!
2	Classic junk food. It's pretty bad. If you want a real burger go up the street to Le Barbare.
5	This A&W has spoiled me, and I don't think any other will ever live up to the experience.  For the first time in my life, the meal I ate actually looked like what was pictured on the menu.  Crazy, huh?  The fries came in a little basket, the drinks in frosted mugs, the burgers fresh and hot and delicious.  It's no Ritz, don't get me wrong, it's a fast food place, but it's fast food like I imagine it to be.  So for the odd indulgence, this was amazing.  I will have to go back another time to make sure that this wasn't a fluke, that it is consistently good.
4	It's a little trashy, but they have root beer on tap in chilled glasses, and it's certainly a step up from Mickey D's for not a whole lot more money (if any at all).
3	3.5/5Take it for what it is, A&W is just another fast food chain. Since this was nearby the loft I was staying in Montreal back in November, I decided to go here for breakfast.They have a self-serve order section right when you enter the store. I never bothered checking to see how it works, but it was interesting at the least. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with sausage and egg along with a large chocolate milk (as they didn't have 2% milk...I didn't expect that).The breakfast sandwich tasted quite good, at par with McDonald's famous breakfast sandwich. The chocolate milk also tasted quite good, but it's just chocolate milk so it's hard for it to taste bad unless it's spoiled.
