5	Top notch family owned business. They found the perfect car for me and actually saved me money $$$ I'll be coming here for my next car for sure!!
5	Great customer service family owned business, and  honest. Me & my husband purchased our 745 BMW last week full warranty love it. If your in the market for a car please check out WEST COAST AUTO SALES. They will be around a long time b/c they care about the people and the business.
1	Bad customer service. Unprofessional and inconsiderate and rude. A lot of things that they have posted about getting approved or all you need is a check is all false. I have been trying to contact them especially the owner john and he or they do not return calls. Don't come here. They are money hungry and that's all they care about. Beware
