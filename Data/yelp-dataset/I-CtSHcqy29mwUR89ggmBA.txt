5	As good as it gets!Caught the Chef and his mobile Bistro at Coach House last night in Scottsdale. Everything I saw getting ordered looked divine, but I had to make a choice, so I went with the The Chicken Breast on Ciabatta for dinner and the apple Beignets to cap off desert. The food was amazing! Everyone at the cart was in awe. My only issue was resisting the temptation to order more after I was full.
5	I've enjoyed dinner from Chef Wade's Bistro on Wheels twice now at the Coach House. Was sharing with friends both times, so got to try the chopped salad, freshly fried calamari, bistro burger, chicken/mango enchiladas, chicken breast sandwich, beignets - all of it incredible! The service was very friendly and quick! Hoping to go again this Wednesday night (he's there on Wed & Fri nights).
5	Amazing food, great people, menu is always interesting, huge servings
