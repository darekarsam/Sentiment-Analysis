4	So I got locked out of my car the other day while I was running into a gas station. So I whip out my phone and search for a locksmith, and these guys popped up. I wasn't sure about a company with no reviews, but they could get there fastest and my engine was running. They showed up pretty quick and the guy that helped me out was pretty friendly.Can't say I liked paying to have a door popped, but I shouldn't have left the keys in the engine and it wasn't too bad anyway! I think the tech said they do house locks as well, but I haven't needed that before. Well, who knows what the future may bring!
4	I had to run up to Phoenix for supplies for my business. I thought it would be nice to take the dogs for a ride with me and then go hiking for a little while afterwards to make it worth the drive. I got to the trail head, got out of the car and closed the door. I went to open the back door to get the dogs out and of course one jumps in the front seat and manages to hit the lock button. At first, I was like oh no big deal, until I realized I didn't have the keys in my pocket. I did have my phone though, so I ended up calling Squaw Peak. They understood that I needed help asap and sent someone right out. I would definitely recommend them to people needing a locksmith in a hurry!
5	Adam cam over to re-key a new rental house.  He arrived on time, gave a fair price, and completed the job in exactly the estimated time.  Then, he ensured that i tried each lock to make sure they all worked as expected.  I'll definitely call him again next time I have a need.
5	Excellent timing, was available late on a Saturday night. Very friendly and trustworthy.
