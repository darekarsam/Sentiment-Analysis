5	Had no idea this place existed, got a mailer for a free haircut so I checked it out. Nice waiting area with a big screen tv after about a 10 min wait I went back. Kellie was my stylist and she asked what I wanted and even asked follow up questions and for any pictures if I had them. I left happy with my haircut and happy that I've finally found a new place to go since my last girl left my old spot and everyone else there did what they wanted to my hair.
5	Wow great place!! I received a coupon and though why not give it a try. Normally I go to great clips because I'm cheap but let me tell you this is way worth the extra $7 I had a great hair cut shampoo hot towel and massage. Ofelia was amazing and very informative and friendly. I think I will be back for sure!
5	Got an awesome haircut from Gigi. She listened and I left with a haircut I love! Makes such a difference :)
5	I went in to get a reservice from anther sports clips, Lindsey did great to fix my hair the way I wanted.
