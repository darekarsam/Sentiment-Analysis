5	I also have a couple of pieces designed by Alex Miranda and love them.  They are one  of a kind pieces that I get compliments on all the time.  I do not live in the area and just happened to be shopping in Old Town when I discovered the store.  I was very happy with the experience and customer service which took several weeks through the design process.
5	I live in North Scottsdale but found Miranda Jewelry for the first time last weekend.  What a hidden treasure.  The pieces are so unique, and Alex took the time to explain the details behind each one that caught my eye.  He also explained how he designs the jewelry, resulting in a truly one-of-a-kind piece and experience.  I highly recommend stopping by the store to find a unique, timeless gift (for someone special or for yourself).  The necklace my husband bought me will not be the last investment we make at Miranda Jewelry.
5	I had a gold pendant with diamonds made by Alex - simple, unusual and beautifully unique. I love one of a kind pieces and this was superb. I recommend anyone living or visiting to come to his shop in Old Town Scottsdale. Simply exquisite!
