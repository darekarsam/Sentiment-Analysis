3	I went here once and found them to be helpful, but there really is no reason to use a realty company to find an apartment on the south side. You're going to pay more because they have to take their cut.Just take a few hours to walk around the streets and look for "for rent" signs. I've found a couple of my apartments that way.
1	If I could give them less stars i would, routinely I would get calls asking for the rent in the middle of the month when it was paid on time, every month. The property manager, Carol, is the most unprofessional person I have ever had to do business with. She constantly would tell you one thing then do the other, then yell at me like I was a child. This company all around is the worse i've ever dealt with. WORSE THAN COMCAST. You don't ask for much as a renter and as long as you pay your rent it should be smooth, this was not by any means.STEER CLEAR AT ALL COSTS.
1	Profoundly unprofessional, with nearly incomprehensible financial statements and poor follow-through. Petty and rude when faced with disagreement. I regret having given them my business and I regret having subjected my tenants to them.
