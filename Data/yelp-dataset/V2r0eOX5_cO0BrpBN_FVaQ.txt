5	Aw! I thought I reviewed this dear joint back when there was still snow on the ground, when I was first delighted to tumble in here and discover this oasis of nice design, great local beers, decent little scotch and whiskey selection, super cool bilingual staff, free wifi etc etc and so much more to love. Le Vestiaire is tucked in between the surreal tube top shops and wedding supply stores of St Hubert, right where you would least expect but most hope to find a cool local bar. So let's give a halleluiah for that asap. There is a special sangria on the menu right now with cranberries and lychee, not sure if this is a usual occurrence but it sounds delicious enough to mention. Also there is a cute patio out front for outdoor drinking, and a few weeks of summer weather left....
4	Great bar in Montreal that has an excellent beer selection and amazing trivia night on Monday nights. I was staying with a group of friends for a couple of weeks and they told me that I had to go to this bar when them and their friends for trivia. Don't speak French? No problem- there were some American pop songs amongst the questions that I could have my hand at guessing. Every time there was a song/Hollywood movie/American geography question, everyone would look over at me like a lifeline to confirm their guesses. In all, I enjoyed the bar- it had a young adult (almost all French speaking) crowd. I'd definitely go back the next time I'm in Montreal.
