4	Food was great, but the inside of the restaurant was very dirty. Straw wrappers everywhere and pieces of food and such. If they did a better job cleaning it would have a 5 star rating. Everything was fresh.
1	Para ser arroz y frijoles,  esta muy caro. No es mi gusto en comida. Pueda que a otros les guste, en lo personal a mi no!!!
5	Finally! We have a chipotle in the East side. I love chipotle, but this one tops many that I have been to. On all the occasions I've been here they have never been stingy with their portions. I always ask for extra hot sauce and corn and they truly do give me extra. Restaurant is always clean and workers work at a fast paste. I would definitely come back.
4	'Chipotle sucks!' - said no one ever.Seriously... everyone loves Chipotle.  I don't even have to write this review.  That's how much everyone loves it.  it's fast, moderately priced, you can get exactly what you want, fresh ingredients and it actually tastes good.  Definitely great if you are looking for a quick & fresh meal!
3	I'm giving this location 3 stars because it has the excellent Chipotle food I love, but they make the chicken too spicy for my kids to eat. I've ordered the kids meal taco kit several times here and every time the chicken is a little on the spicy side (which I actually love), but it's way too spicy for my 2 year old so we always have to go to a farther, less convenient location
