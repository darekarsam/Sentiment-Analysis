5	Great dance center! Very affordable and fun adult classes. So far, I've only taken tap - both have been lots of fun and great exercise. Haven't tried the others yet but plan to. The owner is very great and very nice. Rare to find an affordable place for drop in classes - so glad this is just down the street from me.
5	A place I recently found out. An amazing dance school that encourages people of any level to learn dance. I have tried out Hiphop, Jazz, Tap, Zumba so far and I am in love with this place. Very nice teachers and ofcourse the owner Mary is very nice. They are just starting off, but I am sure they are going to get really successful soon! Good Luck and I highly recommend this place for Adults and Teens of any level dance experience.
