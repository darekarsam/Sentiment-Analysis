2	Not a very big or kept up park. Lots of dog poop left around the park and only street parking, no parking lot. Grass needs to be cut as well. The 2 times ive been here the grass has been long and lots of poop scattered about. Park definetly has potential if kept up.
3	Seeing as I live pretty close to the park I don't need to park there but it seems to be a little bit if an issue w/ street parking.. The park isn't big at all, it's perfect for quick jaunts and playing on the play set. My next beef is that there are no work out stations. This park gets the job done. That's it.
5	I like this park its perfect for the kids to come out and play or if u want to run or even just walk. They have two pieces of equipment for the kids a small piece of equipment for the smaller kids and a larger piece for the bigger kids. Its covered for those HOT summer days. They even have two sets of swing sets one for babies and two for the bigger kids. They also have two covered picnic areas. The front of the park is pretty grassy if u want to have s picnic out in the grass or want to play ball this park does have a lot of FUN stuff.Its great for runners or if u just want to go for a walk. There is always people here playing , kids having a good time.Its well lit up when it starts to get dark out. Plenty of parking on the outer of the park. U could probably even ride ur bike on the walk or run trial.
