5	If you go to Edinburgh and you want to eat Indian, you go here.  The food is so, so much better than Indian food you can get in America (and also so so much better than any other Indian place I ate in Edinburgh--or London!).  The servers are hilarious, especially the main guy, who always teased me about my orders and knew my name AND culinary preferences by the second time I'd even been to the restaurant.  If I lived in this city, you'd bet I'd be eating here weekly (if not nightly...)
5	My flatmates and I have tried various Indian takeaways but we always seem to back to the Guru because their food is simply amazing.  Balti as good as it gets.  And the naan breads are giant.It may not be the cheapest place for a takeaway but totally worth every penny!I have not eaten in the restaurant so cannot comment on the service.
4	I have been to the Guru Balti a few times, over several years. It can be summed up as offering good quality meat and above average curry, though the hotter dishes tend to lack that real zing of back end heat. They have some of the best and biggest naan bread though their rice doesn't particularly stand out.The restaurant tends to be fairly quiet through the week, making it a good choice for post cinema eating if you happen to be at the nearby Cineworld. Guru is a good choice for an Indian meal and if you live in the area it should probably be your Indian restaurant of choice.
