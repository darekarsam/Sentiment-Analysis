5	Great food & service. Half & half soup sandwich option is a great way to go. Outside tables are a good option on a nice day as well. Something for everyone.
4	I like McAlister's.  Just found out about this location in Baxter.  The employees were friendly and helpful. The tomato bisque soup was very, very tasty!  I also ordered a side of mashed potatoes and gravy. This was disappointing.  The Elmer's glue I ate in Elementary school tasted better. It seemed as if this batch had been sitting around all day long.I would return.
4	McAlister's is a respectable quick service chain restaurant.  The sweet tea is among the best I have had.  Most of the menu is at least somewhat healthy.  I love the Savannah Chopped Chicken Salad and the dressing that accompanies it.  Service is always quick and friendly.
4	Average sandwich type food but AWESOME sweet tea.  Wish there were more of these in Florida by our home. Also sugar cookies are primo.
