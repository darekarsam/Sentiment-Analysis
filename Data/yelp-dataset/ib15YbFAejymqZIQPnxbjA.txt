5	I'm a young male who just wanted a pretty simple haircut w/ no styling, so take this review with a grain of salt.  However, there was no wait, the stylist understood exactly what I wanted, and the whole deal only cost $13 plus tip.  From what I understand, this rate is reduced further to $10 on Tuesdays.  Worth a look!
4	Like the other reviewer, I'm a ~30 y/o male who just wanted a pretty simple haircut w/ no styling.There was a little bit of a wait but no more than 10-15 minutes. The stylist understood just what I was looking for and I was all done in about 15 minutes.The rate has gone up slightly from the 2007 review -- the price is now $11 on Tuesdays -- but this price also applies on Wed which is pretty great.A fine haircut in the C-U area for cheap means I'll be back in about 45 days for another one.
4	Good quality, fast haircut. Great location near campus. $11 Tuesdays, $13.95 Men's otherwise.
5	I loved this place from the moment I walked in. Such hospitality and kindness. Stephanie was great, she took my information and promptly helped me. She was great at not only genuine conversation, but welcomed me to the city--it was my first week and I was just trying to find local places to handle necessities that I needed taken care of. Not only all of that, but the haircut was great! Exactly how I wanted and listened to what I had to say about my hair before, during and after. I absolutely recommend this place! Plus they have an $11 special every Tuesday!
5	Fast, friendly and affordable.  They do a great job and I have no complaints.  Keep up the great work.
5	Great stylist, they know their stuff. Very affordable and stylist keep up with trends.
5	This location is awesome. The people are always friendly and Stephanie is very skilled. She managed to cut an identical haircut that I got in California that cost $60! Not only is she friendly and talented, she is efficient! I am so thankful I found her!
