3	I frequent Torta De La Reyes in Sunnyslope regularly. It is a great place to eat. I saw that they had one at Vee Quiva Casino and said well I might as well try that one also. The lady at the counter was less than pleasant. I ordered the Carne Asada Torta. Once I got my food I asked for salsa and the lady told me that it would be 53 cents. I have to buy salsa at a Mexican eatery? Wth? The Torta tasted very good so that is why they got three stars but the rest was disappointing.
1	If I can give a 0 star I will !!!!!! I order a Tostada of ceviche there for 6,45 dollar a combo an they only gave me this !!!!! Never go back here !!!! Never order a tostada of ceviche !!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!
