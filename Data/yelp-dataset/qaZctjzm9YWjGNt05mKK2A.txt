4	a fine repertory cinema/cinema museum, not to mention the high shrine to Quebec film
5	Honestly, only one review? The Cinematheque Quebecoise is a hidden gem. I've been here a few times and seen some amazing, rare, projections. Last night I went to see a film adaptation of Charles Dicken's novel "Oliver Twist." The film,shot on 16mm and released in 1922, was silent with English subtitles. In addition to the film itself, the musical score was played live, in house by a wonderful pianist who played a baby grand piano at the front of the theatre for the entirety of the film - AWESOME. I arrived well before the film commenced as I suspected the theatre would be packed. My prediction couldn't have been more inaccurate. I'd say there about 15 people in the audience. This baffles me. For $7 (student price), this is the best value for anyone who appreciates the cinema or culture in general. GO!
