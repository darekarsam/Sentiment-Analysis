4	I was referred to Rankin by my general practitioner when I got that great big plus sign.  My OB here was Dr. Yavorski, who was sweet, encouraging and calm at all times - well, except for my last appointment when it seemed labor was imminent (it was) - then she was appropriately excited.  If you are going to Rankin for prenatal care and delivery, there is a team of 7 doctors (although I think one of them only practices at the Ballantyne location) and you will be encouraged to meet all of them as any one of them could be on call when you deliver.  I will say that I felt comfortable with all of the doctors.  They all exuded calmness, which was important to me.  Dr. Palermo actually ended up delivering me and her deadpan wit was the perfect thing to get me through the process.  I'd planned on an unmedicated birth, and the doctors were all supportive.  It wasn't until I went into labor and had a personal change of heart that I went for pain meds and they were supportive of that too.  I never felt like I was bullied or strong-armed into making a choice, and whenever I had questions they were answered to my satisfaction.  My pregnancy was pretty uneventful so I never really got to see them work in a crisis though. These doctors deliver at Presbyterian hospital, which is state of the art.Well after everything I came out a healthy mom to a healthy baby boy, so I'm at least a fan.
5	Went today for the first time because of a referral by a friend. The facility is really nice and the personnel we're all extremely nice. Getting a "physical" is never a fun experience but doctor Yavorski was super quick and very gentle. She was very nice and asked thorough questions. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a new OBGYN!!
5	Dr Palermo delivered my son. I absolutely loved her and her care. She is in high demand so I don't get to see her during exams but will definitely have her delivery my future babies!
