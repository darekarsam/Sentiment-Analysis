4	I love supporting local and Ruben's shop is awesome! I have purchased 2 bicycles from here because of the friendly atmosphere and the decent selection for the price. This is a small shop but they provide good service and they will be able to get you set up with a good bike in a short period of time, for less $$ than you will spend at the bigger shops. Check 'em out!
5	I needed a local shop near me after a spoke on my bike broke. I use my bike to get to and from work. They took my tire as a walk-in. It was done in a couple hours for way less than I was expecting. I usually go to a big bike shop and I was expecting to leave my bike overnight for a lot more. I will not go back to the big bike shop. I will come back to Bike Zone on Glendale and 35th ave.
5	Fair prices and fast service. Ruben was very helpful when I needed my hard to find 32" inner tubes changed. Charged me less per tire including installation than it would have cost me to order the tires and have them arrive a week later.
