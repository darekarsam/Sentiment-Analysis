4	The crepes here are really fantastic.  I had a mushroom, bechamel sauce and asparagus crepe and by the time I was done I was swirling my finger around the plate so I could get every last calorie into my body. So yummy.  We also ordered french fries but they never came. By the time we finished our crepes we were so full we were sort of happy about the mess up so we didn't mind.  The waitress was also lacking in that she never returned to our table and we practically had to send out smoke signals to get a check.   We had also planned to have another drink but since she never came back that was a no go too.  Even with the bad service I'd go back without any hesitation.
4	I'm glad the intoxicating sweet aroma of crepes doesn't make it out beyond the front door or else this quaint little place would be packed, with nowhere to sit. Luckily, it was a Tuesday morning so we shared our brunchtime with just a handful of other lucky patrons. Great cozy atmosphere, tasty yummies and lovely, gratious service.
1	We waited and waited and waited to be served... It was a nice and warm September day and we were hungry so we waited some more, but after almost 20 min unsuccessfully trying to get the attention of the waiter.... we left!Probably won't be coming back...
