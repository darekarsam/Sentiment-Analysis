5	Customer service and work is amazing. They went out of their way to ensure the work was done correctly. Would totally recommend having work done. Brandy is a pleasure to work with
5	Spooky Fast Customs is a great company to work with, Brandy is very helpful and informative. They do everything it seems and if they don't they will come up with the best solution to work with you. Their work is second to none. I'd recommend their work to anyone and look forward to doing business with them in the future.
5	Couldn't have had a better experience! I'm a musician who needed some gear powder coated. Worked with Brandy (who's awesome) who gave me an estimate and a time estimate and Spooky ended up doing it on budget and faster than the estimate! When I got it back every piece of hardware (and it was a lot) was lovingly wrapped up individually, which must have been really time consuming! Fair price, good service and fast! Any other musicians out there in the same boat, this is the place!
