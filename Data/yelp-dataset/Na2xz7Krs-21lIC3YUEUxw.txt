5	Tiffany & Kasadee are AmaZing! They cut and colored my best friend's, mothers and my hair for my wedding. I go to Tiffany all the time, but they were able to fit the 3 of us in days before my wedding. The cut and color on my mom was perfect, and she was able to make my hair even more beautiful than she had ever before for my special day. I cannot say enough good things about them!
5	I love Tiffany and Kasadee! I always come with a picture and Tiffany makes it happen! I highly recommend crush salon Tiffany does an excellent job and it doesn't ever break my bank.
5	What a salon!! What can I say - I came to VEGAS for a vacation all the way from the UK and thought there is nothing better than having a transformation with my hair - by applying some ombre extensions! The drive from the strip to crush was quick only 10 minutes from the hard rock hotel ($15 cab)! On arrival I met my stylist Tiffany who was so lovely and down to earth! She new exactly what I wanted and had the hair extensions all ready to be applied, at a very reasonable price, she coloured my hair cut and styled it then applied the ombre extensions and I was amazed at the results!!! Would definitely recommend Tiffany! Thank you again - another very happy costumer
