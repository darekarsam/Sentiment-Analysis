2	$32 dollars for a pizza with no sauce in the middle. Need I say more. Too bad, I wish this place was better since I can walk there from my home. Huge miss for Rosatis in DC Ranch.
1	Walked into the restaurant last night (me on crutches). Waited several minutes to be seated, and when no one acknowledged us, we seated ourselves on the patio. Two different waitresses came out to check on other tables, but never came over to us. My husband went inside to try to tell someone (anyone!) that we were waiting, to no avail. After 20 minutes, we got up and left. There is no excuse for this, especially when the place is almost empty. We won't be back.
5	Wow!  Pizza was great and beer was cold.  Definitely coming back to take advantage of all of the games on their big screen TVs.Happy hour pricing is amazing and great menu.
