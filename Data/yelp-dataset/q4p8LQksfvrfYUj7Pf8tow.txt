4	Love this location because it is close to where I live, but also because you can get food items at a great price.The key here is to go regularly as the specials always changesome of the good deals i get here are Butter (no name brand), which can often be found at between 2.99-3.49 a pound and they always have salted and non salted (great if you bake)Cheddar cheese, they have two brands that are on sale regulary, from mild to Extra fort, for about half the regular costIce cream (various brands like Breyers, and Magnum's), almost always half priceEggs for 2.19Bottled waters, their Eska is always on sale  4 for 5$, and my new fav a Life brand flavored water 6 for 1.79 (can beat that)Juice (Tropicana), often 2- 5$Cleaning product like Bio life, which are green and many others that are all sale regulary.There are always sale items through out the store so going regularly up and down the isles is usefull, and a great way to stock up on things like toiletries.The pharmacie is also where you wil find really nice people with great advice.Another tip is get the optimum card, it will quickly add up especially on household items and you will be rewarded 10$ off so why not it takes 2 min to get one and it's free.And they have free parking in the back, but beware they close the back entry after 18h.
4	Free parking in the back, very wide aisles (used to be a grocery store), large selection of food and junk food. Lots of frozen treats and beverages. All these little things add up to a great pharmacy, recommeded.
1	Avoid the prescription counter. Wonder why there is nobody there ?
