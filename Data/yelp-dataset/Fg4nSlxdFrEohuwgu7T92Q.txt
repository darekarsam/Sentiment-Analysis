5	Great service. The first reliable and honest mechanic I have encountered to date. Remember a mechanic u can trust is worth his weight in gold. Calfo's is one
5	Excellent people.  They stayed late when AAA took forever to come tow my car.  They were very reasonably priced and took good care of my car.  I can't say enough good things.
5	Great and honest service. The guys were kind and straightforward, letting me know all that i needed in order to make decisions about my car.  Reasonably priced and quick service (considering my car was towed during a winter morning).  Thankful they were so close!!
5	Calfo's has been my mechanic for several years now and I absolutely trust them! They are honest, caring people and very knowledgeable about the work that they do! Every time I take my car in to them, they explain what needs to be done, and they fix it for less than anywhere else would. (I know because I've been to many other shops and also called around for price quotes!) I will never take my car anywhere else. Calfo's really is the best!
5	Honest and fair. I tried a wide array of mechanics around town and as soon as I took my car here, I have stuck with the place ever since and have never been disappointed.
5	This was an incredibly affordable place, the service was great, it was friendly and timely. They went to work immediately on my car and they actually fixed my problem, unlike most places I'll go to. They were cool, honest guys and I would recommend this place to other people who don't know where to go.
