5	We went up North last weekend. The facility was great. Seemed very clean and the the dog suites are state of the art. Will use again.
5	My family and I have trusted Foothills Pet Resort with our furry family members for years! (My parents use the Ahwatukee location). Our dogs are groomed here regularly and always come home happy and looking adorable. We've also sent our dogs to stay here overnight without a worry, the facility is clean and comfortable and our animals are always well cared for.
