5	We recently moved to Henderson and needed mattresses for our master bedroom and two kids rooms. We went to a few furniture stores but were unhappy with the lack of knowledge sales personnel had about their mattresses. Stopped by the USA mattress store on a Sunday afternoon and found the owner to know his product very well. He understood my husbands back issues, and  took his time helping us decide on the best choice for us. Service  was excellent - delivery was made Monday afternoon.All in all - a very pleasant experience.
5	Alan (the owner) really took the time to listen to what we wanted, and then directed us to mattresses which fit our rather difficult taste. I had no hesitation buying from him. He even got it delivered same day.
5	My husband and I went there on a budget we bought a unbelieveable matters from him for such a great price,when it came to deliver it , it was out of stock for two week.Alan didn't want us to wait that long so he upgraded it us for free and had it delivered that day. I haven't seen a person go above and beyond to make somebody that happy may god bless you and your business. Thanx a million Alan!.                                                                             Kat n Nate DeGrange
5	Just moved here and Alan was the first person I saw ! And well I walked in saw what I wanted and it was delivered in 3 hours! Impressive! So impressed actually went back 3 weeks later and bought another bed! Can't say anything but extreme happiness and total satisfaction thanks Alan
5	I shopped around a ton for the right mattress.  Little worried because I kept seeing high prices.  Went to USA mattresses and he gave me the best deal by far with a wide selection.  Comfortable shopping environment, great service, great people, great family business.
5	Allen Is great, when I need a mattress again I will go see him again.
