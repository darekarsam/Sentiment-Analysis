4	If you need photographic supplies in Charlotte, this is the place to go.  If they don't have something you need, they will order it for you.  They have good prices and a helpful staff.  They also process many types of film. Also - this place has a used section for buying or selling used equipment.
4	Much better pricing than Biggs although their selection is smaller.  Theyre also a lot friendlier and have competitive prices to b&h and amazon on bogen and loewpro bags. Good store for trying out gear before you use it, but i havent had prints done here.
3	Camera World seems like a cool photography supply/camera store. I tried to take my old SLR camera in to sell it there. But there is apparently not much of a market for old-timey film cameras (as I expected), so they said they could sell it on consignment, but it probably wouldn't sell for much and might not be worth it. I was disappointed, but also appreciated their honesty.
4	The shop closed in June of 2009
4	Unfortunately, they're CLOSED.I shopped there as a Davidson student in the 1970's. I bought tons of AV gear there (cameras, dissolve units, slide projectors, lenses, cases, etc.) when I was a producer of multi-image in the 1980s. I miss those folks. They were professionals and specialists --- in every sense of the words.
