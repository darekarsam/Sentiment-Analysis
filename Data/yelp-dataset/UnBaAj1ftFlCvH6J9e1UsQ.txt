5	We have been at Glen Taylor for 5 years. And what a blessing. We have only had great experiences with dedicated and committed educators and staff. NO other professional or educator outside of glen taylor was able to determine one of my children's learning .My children have made some very dear friends. And so have I!
4	I am very pleased with this school.  Coming from a school I thought was above average I am surprised at how superior Glen Taylor is in every way.  First, off, they actually give feedback daily on your child's progress, the teachers are friendly and accessible.  The office staff is always happy to help and information is available in the form of pamphlets and flyers.  The gate program is excellent as well and the 5th grade Pali trip really made my daughter's year.  If I had one criticism, however, it is the lack of use of technology.  Although they have computers available, they seem to only use them for testing.  Also, the website is seriously lacking in updates especially teacher websites.  I understand they are moving to a new webhost so I am anxiously awaiting everyone being up and running on the internet.  Other than that, I am glad we didn't get our zone transfer to stay at Ober, Glen Taylor is much superior.
5	Awesome school, great environment. My daughters both went or are there. Love the staff
