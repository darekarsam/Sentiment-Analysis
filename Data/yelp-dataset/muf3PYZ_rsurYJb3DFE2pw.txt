5	2 years in and I still love these guys...prompt, admit when and if a mistake was made (just one so far) and just plain good folks. Highly Recommend!
5	Super friendly and great service - took 3 vintage Hawaiian shirts to be laundered & 1 to be pressed and it was just over $10...most excellent!
4	I have been coming here for the last month since the good dry cleaner by my house shut down. This place is inexpensive and does a fine job. Today I dropped off: two dress shirts; and one pair of pants. Total for dry cleaning $9.50. They will be ready Monday afternoon, this is typical of this dry cleaner's 3 day turnover rate. When you receive your shirts they are neatly pressed with a plastic tab attached to the crossed arms. No complaints!
5	Friendly, quick & great service. Smiling faces & excellent work will get 5 stars from me every time!
1	Dropped off dry cleaning Thursday for one day service to be picked up Friday after 3pm on the way to the airport dropped in, was told not ready only to discover it was still sitting in the dirty clothes pile ..... Told to come back Monday ..... Went out of town flight didn't arrive till Monday evening so went in Tuesday afternoon was told come back Wednesday after 3pm cause now the machine was not working ..... Thursday morning want in again and was told he can take $5 off a $47 bill ..... I'm sorry not good enough was told to come back to speak to the manager ....... Once this dispute has been settled I won't be going back for the lack of sympathy and rude gentlemen at the front, no compensation for waiting almost a week, if you decide to drop off here I would make sure they deliver what promise.
