3	Crepe Cafe was formerly known as Tout Sweet. Apparently, it used to be owned by the owners of Cafe Luna and The Bread Company but not anymore. The place is very small and only has about 6 tables. They have both sweet and savory crepes but I would recommend the smoked salmon crepe. I had that for lunch and it was very delicious. The only drawback is their service; it was VERY slow. If they only have 6/7 tables, I don't understand why it took me at least 15 minutes to get my food. So, if you're in a hurry, think twice before going there.
4	Maybe I'm the exception, but I had a good experience here!My friend and I decided to come here for brunch one morning and to dine in.  The wait for our crepes did take a little bit of time, but bear in mind - they're making these crepe's from scratch on the spot, and they're really really yummy!We split a sweet crepe (banana-peanut butter-nutella ) and a savory one (tomato-pesto-basil).  Both were really really good.  They're also filling!  We were too full to try any of their gelato or specialty drinks, but everything on their menu looked so good that I know I'll be back to try their other items!The waitstaff was nice and helpful as well, and inside it was all sunny and happy feeling (yay for lots of windows, bright decor, and white, minimalistic furniture).You could call ahead and take out, or if you have some extra time for some good food and a relaxing meal, then try out Crepe Cafe.
4	While, my wife and I had enjoyed our previous visits, when we were in the area.  The business appears to have closed.  A hand written sign on the door basically says Sorry we have closed.  It was the only North America location that I am aware of.  Guess the next time were down under we will try them again.
