4	I stop in here every time I'm in town visiting family and they've always been accomodating even without an appointment.  Nice place and friendly staff.
5	Clean, nice, and accommodating. Everything you expect from your nail salon. They even offer you water which is a nice plus. They offer almost all OPI colors.
1	I always will give a business a second chance. My second visit was worst than my first. I have had both a manicure and pedicure given to me by two of the rudest people. Save your time and money and go elsewhere to enjoy your spa experience because you probably won't enjoy it here.
4	Every once in a while (and I mean very rarely - maybe twice a year) I treat myself to a manicure/pedicure. When I came in, I opted just for a basic manicure. Kathy was my nail technician. She was nice, not too chatty, and did a good job. I thought it was a little silly at the end when she had me sit in the waiting area and put my nails in front of a mini-fan to dry them but it didn't bother me. They also offer you a mini bottle of water, which I think is a nice gesture. My manicure was $12 before tip which I think is the going rate for non-gel manicures. Overall, a perfectly good nail salon with reasonable pricing.
5	Brought by a friend. I have been to 3 other salons in the area and this one by far raises the bar. Great service. Quickly started. No chit chat. Prices are great. Eye brow wax, ped, fill with gel coat. I will be going back. And conveniently off the 101.
