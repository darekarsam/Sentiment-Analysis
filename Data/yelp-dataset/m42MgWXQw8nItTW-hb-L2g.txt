5	Very fast, on time very positive attitude. Best of all fixed my problem. Thanks Caleb
5	Caleb is simply the best in the business. He was extremely prompt and professional. He gave my full A/C and heating system a look over. His inspection lasted about an hour. He then gave me a full list of things that needed to be done, in order of precedence. He told me honestly what should be addressed and what could wait. He is extremely cautions to work cleanly. When he brought in a ladder to access the attic, he laid down a rug so his ladder wouldn't touch our floors. When he came in to give us the bill, he took his shoes off. I would highly recommend Arizona Air Experts to anyone. All said and done, and inspection plus cleaning only costed $90.
5	So happy I found these guys, Ac went out while it was 115 outside, 97 degrees in the house! I called 10 other places with "24 hour  emergency service" not one would come out. I called Caleb at 5:00pm he showed up at 5:30pm the same day and had us up and running by 6:30! I will be using these guys for all my future Ac needs!
