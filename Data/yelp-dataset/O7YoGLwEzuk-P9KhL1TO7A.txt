5	Kristyne is amazing! Best bartender in town, and it doesn't hurt that she's smoking hot. This place has a great staff all around, Kristyne and Glen in particular.
1	It's Monday at 9am and they are not open for breakfast like their sign says. "Daily 6-10am"
1	We went last night for a friend's going away party, we had a party of 25, as soon as we arrived the servers looked really mad that we had a large party, our server Monica was not very nice and she'd forget our drinks so we would go to the bar and order one and then she'd come over and yell at us for what she called "double ordering" while the food and beverages were adequate they have horrible customer service, we wont be returning anytime soon.
1	Every single time I have ever came here, the bartenders don't say hi or even respond to you for about 30 minutes. They are always talking to each other, laughing, making jokes. It's pretty rude to ignore your customers. 7 months ago, when I was pregnant, I came in to eat. I ordered my food and a water and had already been waiting about 15 minutes for my food. Until the bartender comes up to me and cards me. That's fine, because I'm of age. By birthday was the day before and my I'D had expired. They made me leave, AFTER ordering, when I was clearly pregnant. She wouldn't even sell me my food to go. She told me she would loose her job.
4	What great service tonight with the bartenders !!!! Thank You PT's for having real Bartenders tonight for Thursday night football !!!!!!
