1	Go to Chevron across the street! This gas station sucks. I went to 2 pumps and both didn't work. I finally got the next one to work but of course the printer didn't work to give me a receipt ughhh!!! So annoying especially when you're in a hurry!
5	Best gas station ever. When it was a USA gasoline. The station was not clean and they didn't take care of the place. Ever since Mobi came In the place is hella clean. They are still improving the store but I understand. Overall I will be stopping here when ever I'm in Vegas
4	This is my gas station. I come here for all my gas filling needs.This station has been called many things in the past. Some have called it a USA gasoline. Others before then called it an Albertson's gasoline. But I will refer to it as what it deserves to be called, Mobil gasoline.Whatever reincarnated pump station that it was, and presently, known for is its cheap prices. They are normally about 7-9 cents cheaper than a Chevron. And while Arco does beat it by a little more, you don't have to do that weird debit card thing at Arco. If you've been to Arco you know what I'm talking about.All the gas at Mobil is Top Tier gasoline. What is that you ask? Well, that's why there is Google. Look, top tier gas might be the biggest scam of our lifetimes, I have no clue. But for now, I'm a bo-liever!So what's preventing this place from getting 5 stars? Dolphins.. Because who is going to stand up for the dolphins??? I will stand with them, because they are like humans of the ocean. One day when mankind is destroyed, the dolphins are eventually going to take over the world. So, no more oil accidents, Mobil. Or me and Flipper are gonna kick sum ay-ass!!
