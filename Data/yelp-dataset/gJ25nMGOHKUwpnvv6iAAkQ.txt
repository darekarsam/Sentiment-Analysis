2	I have had difficult experiences my last three times here.  First time they forgot an item I had ordered, they were very apologetic and offered a free shake which I appreciate but did not accept.  My second time their diet coke was not working.  Most recently they were out of large cups.  In all these are not huge problems, but it seems like whoever is running the place is letting it fall apart.
