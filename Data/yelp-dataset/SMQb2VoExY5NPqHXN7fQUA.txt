4	Quickly and accurate service, this location was generous with the ketchup & taco sauce :-) I hate getting 2 ketchups with a fry order, having to practically beg for more!
1	The first time I had Jack in the Box was in Dallas Texas and it was pretty decent. So when I got here I was happy to see one. Unfortunately this location is a huge let down. I've only gone about 3 or 4 times in the 2 years I've been here. The drive thru is never busy unlike Mcdonalds which is a few feet away. Now I like McDonalds as much as the next American, but I despise long lines more than the average American. I'd much rather wait there than breeze through Jack in the Box's drive thru though. On to the meal that prompted this review. As I mentioned before I've come here a few times and was always disappointed with the food. The only reason I came this time was because my co-worker was driving and I had no other choice. Anyhoo, the curly fries were extremely cold and my soda was flat. I got my hopes up when I saw the picture for the bacon insider burger that promised a lot of bacony goodness. I expected my taste buds to be assaulted (in a good way) with a burger that had bacon bits inside the patty, bacon mayo and bacon strips. Sounds like bacon heaven right? Wrong!!! I tasted no difference from any other run of the mill bacon burger. Oh well, the next time I'm in the position of eating jacks or starving, I think I'll just starve.
4	I've been to this location several times and always receive very good service. They are a little slow on delivering the food, but I think this is due to the fact that they make most things to order.I went through the drive-thru today and was the only person in line. I STILL had to wait several minutes for my order. The girl working the window, Nicolle, was very friendly and polite.The food was good and just as ordered.I am sure I will go back to this location and I recommend it to others.
