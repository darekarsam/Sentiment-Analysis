3	If you're from the New England area, this is your joint.  Patriots, Red Sox, BC, etc...all the time on a massive amount of plasma monitors.  Seriously, there's at least 23-30 of them.  I'm not from that section of the country, so the whole Boston thing wears a bit thin.  The food is decent.  There's a substantial selection of bar-type food that's on par with the Fox & Hounds and Graduates, though a bit pricier.  The service was rather slow.  Might have to go back when the Panthers play the Pats to see what the local Boston contingent is like.
3	Good food, but not as atmospheric as the Matthews location.  This Beantown Tavern was one big open room with harsh lighting.  They had a LOT of televisions with a variety of sports options, but it felt "unfinished" restaurant-wise.  A tavern sounds "homey," which this Beantown didn't feel. Atmosphere aside, I love the variety of food options they offer.  20 appetizer choices?  Wow.  The rest of the menu continues that variety, making it a tough call.  I went with the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which was very big and dripping with delicious hot sauce and blue cheese.  The fries they serve are very flavorful as well.  So while the food at this location is a step above regular bar food, the atmosphere is severely lacking, making it not a good place for a "night out."
3	We stopped in for a light bite and a beer...and this is now Stadium Tavern.  Not a bad place to have a cold one while watching the game.
