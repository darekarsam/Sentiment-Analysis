4	I bought a fantastic mattress at a great price. Jim Lane the sales associate who helped me was very informed and went out of his way to make sure I got exactly what I wanted and above all wasn't pushy. All in all a wonderful buying experience.
5	Recently purchased a  mattress at the stone crest location. Jim Lane was so helpful! He is very knowledgable and doesn't make you feel like he is trying to make a commission off of you. Also, he is up front about the price and any deals available. We got our mattress the next day and have had great sleep ever since!
