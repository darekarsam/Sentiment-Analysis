4	This Super C is really amazing. Not only is the service friendly and with a smile, the food available here is always fresh and they have a fish variety like no other. There is a taxi service outside of the store too which is convenient if you do not own a car. The exotic food section has more variety than any other Super C I've visited.
1	Convert this to an Adonis and you will get 5 stars...
2	I don't know what's a Super C doing in this area, does not really match the Atwater Market vibe.This is where you will see the gentrification occur before your eyes. It's located between the fancy condos along the Atwater Market and Notre-Dame Ouest.Poor elderly wandering aimlessly as well as the yuppies avoiding them. WowThe prices seemed a bit too high, and the selection is really just ok. Did not really see anything unique that jumps out at you.
