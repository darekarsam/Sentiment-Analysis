5	Just what you'd expect from this staple in the sub business, but friendlier than any I've seen before. Maybe that's because it's not on a college campus. Either way - 5 stars it is!
5	If you've never been to a Jimmy John's, you probably hate fast and fresh sandwiches.  This location is even better than every other JJs I've been to.  It has a drive-thu!  Seriously!  I'll bet it took me less than two minutes to order, get my food, and drive away.If you love sandwiches, you have to love JJs...it really is the go-to.Try:  The Italian Night ClubAvoid:  Forgetting to ask for the hot peppers
5	Great place! Always fast! Always great customer service! Really good size sandwich for the price!
5	Some of the neon lights were on so I came rolling through the drive-thru at 9:30 this morning hoping I could order some sandwiches for a lunch meeting I and today.  Damon immediately answered the drive-thru asking what I wanted so I assumed they were open...I paid, got my sandwiches and right before I pulled off asked "Hey...what time do you guys open."  He shrugged and said "11am"  Now THAT is what I call service.  I mean, how many times have you been to a drive-thru 2 minutes before opening or even two minutes before closing and the kid on the other end of the speaker says "Sorry.  We're closed."  And here, at the Jimmy John's on Harris Corners Pkwy, I show up an HOUR AND A HALF early and they gladly put together an order for me without a single subtle hint of "hey lady, we are not even close to open yet."  Thanks for making my day, Damon and team.  You guys deserve a raise!
