5	I have been shipping from this store for a while, and when a mailbox was needed, this UPS store is much closer to home than the post office, so I gave it a go.Ron has always been friendly and personable whenever I have gone in. He talks to his customers, gets to know them, and remembers them. He hasn't forgotten the value of customer service!If he isn't busy helping other customers, and notices me drive into the parking lot, I won't make it to the door, before he has made it to the back section, grabbed the larger packages I have received and meets me with them. Their phone call service to let you know when packages arrive is extremely helpful as well.
5	Shipping and so much more!Ron is professional and hilarious.  His constant banter is a welcome change!  He really made our necessary stop a happy, fun time.  You should go here, if just to have a good chat.
5	It's always a pleasure to stop by this UPS branch, which is rare for necessary errands! Ron is great and provides fantastic customer service.
1	You would think that when you own a business, one would be friendly or at least courteous to customers, especially since there are thousand places you can use for shipping. The owner of this place is do rude. I left without sending my package, who wants to deal with his attitude.
