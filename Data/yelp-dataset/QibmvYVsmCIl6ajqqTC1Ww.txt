5	We have been using Jeff's services for more than 15 years. He has groomed dogs of all ages for us -- from rambunctious puppy all the way through old, blind and delicate -- and always, always does an excellent job. It's so convenient to have him come right to the door -- and his prices are better than most of the pet grooming salons near us.  He's totally dependable, professional and extremely good-humored. We have recommended him without hesitation to several friends and without fail, those who have used his services call us back to thank us. He is absolutely the best.
5	We used Petagree Mobile today for the first time and it was awesome! We have an extra large dog so we've never really liked taking him to the groomers knowing that he'd have to spend the day in a cage that's probably too small for him. Instead of dealing with that, the Jeff from Petagree Mobile comes to you. The grooming, bathing, etc. is all done in Jeff's trailer, which has everything you would expect to find at a regular groomer. Jeff arrived on time and the whole process took about an hour. Our dog looks fantastic and he is not stressed out at all. The price was competitive; the convenience and service were definitely worth it. We will be calling Jeff again in the future!
1	The website says, "Serving North West Phoenix, Glendale, Peoria And Paradise Valley Since 1996!"  So, I emailed them.  The reply I got from Jeff was, "Thank you for your inquiry. Unfortunately, I do not service the area of 75th Ave/Bethany. Thanks for considering Petagree."  But, 75th Ave/Bethany is in Glendale.  I asked him for clarification and am awaiting his reply.  I will update my review based on his response.
3	He replied and apologized for not having the correct information on his website.  He said he would update the website accordingly.
