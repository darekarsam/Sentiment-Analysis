3	Compared to some older, outdated Guzzo theaters in Montreal (Le Colissee,I'm looking at you!) this location is nice enough. Yes, we're still stuck waiting in line to pay our tickets but it gives you that retro, pre-smart phone feel that you cherish, in a not so fond way, of a few mere years ago when you couldn't order your tickets online and just have them scan it on the way in, like at the Colossus.The place was clean and spacious a neat improvement as well from other Guzzo locations. The theater itself was new and the seating comfortable. I watched my movie and peace and left feeling satisfied that the Guzzo family actually spent some money to make this place somewhat decent.
1	Go big or go home ? Really ?I'll stay home, thank you
3	$6 on Tuesday. Can get really crowded fast. Go early for seats and line up.  I went to the washroom and came back to a huge line..but I didn't cut the line! Younger crowd here.
