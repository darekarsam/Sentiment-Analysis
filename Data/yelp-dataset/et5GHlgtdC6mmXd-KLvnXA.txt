4	Sitting there enjoying the day before it gets hot. I'll make this review short & sweet. :)Driving around my neighborhood, I found this cute park on Wigwam Pkwy, right in front of Selma Bartlett Elementary. My son enjoys the little kids playground. Its a little run-down, but adequate. There's also a baseball field where there's a kids' game going on right now! Volleyball court, tennis court, benches in the shade, and a restroom provided with drinking fountain. A great big grassy area so lots of dog-walkers roaming around. Not much more you can ask for in a park. We'll be back... :)

A baseball field which is made for the little kids so don't go smacking the ball thinking your MLB material cause there are no fences in the outfield and they'll go into traffic.  There's a couple sand/dirt volleyball courts, a few tennis courts, restrooms, lots of trees for this little tiny park, a couple pavilions for gatherings. And a playground and big grassy field to go running and screaming around after all that candy. Don't remember if there where any electrical outlets or lights in the pavilions.

We stumbled across this one located on wigwam parkway across the Grand Legacy guard gated community.It was a nice little park which had a basketball court, tennis court, and playground for the kids, conveniently  located in Henderson, green valley area in front of Bartlett elementary school.A great time to go was in the afternoon, the place was empty and we had the Tennis courts to ourselves. AWesome!FYI- Bring hand sanitizer since the park bathroom are a bit dirty, and soap if your a germ freak. Other than the park was great. Will definitely be back since its location is great!
