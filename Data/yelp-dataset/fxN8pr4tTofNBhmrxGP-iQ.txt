5	Blair can create an amazing cake for any occasion, and it will taste fabulous! My wedding cake was absolutely gorgeous and mouth watering. Remember Blair's custom cakes for all of your special occasions!
5	I have been going to Blair the past 2 years. She can make a cake for any occasion. So far she's done a birthday cake for me, my wedding cake, baby shower, and my daughters 1st birthday coming up. Her cakes are very moist, flavorful, and absolutely beautiful. Her prices are very reasonable too. All of my guest at each event were very impressed.  There isn't anything Blair can't do and I will never go anywhere else again but to her
5	I was quite reluctant to do a 20-minute journey to eat only the 'biscuits', especially considering that Surprise, AZ is full of excellent bakeries. Having snapped the cookie in semitrailer of Blair's Custom Cakes, in the crowd, I had to change my mind: for the first time the AZ  takes big cookie one at zero eclair French.
