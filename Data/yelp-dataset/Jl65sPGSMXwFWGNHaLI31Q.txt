5	Talk about attention to detail, Jeff the owner of "Fix My RV", is one of the most detailed persons I have ever met.  I had some cracking of the rubberize sealant around the vents and seams on the roof of my coach.  I had Jeff take a look and it defintely needed to be repaired.  Jeff took his time and made sure every crack in the sealant was filled in.  It now looks as good as the day I bought it.  Jeff was very friendly and he also checked other system components and items on my coach for possible recalls. Jeff really knows his stuff I cannot recommend him highly enough.
5	Fix my RV did a great job on our older Motorhome.  We needed a new AC unit in the back and had to upgrade the thermostat to be able to talk to the older AC unit in the front.  Lots of unknowns ran into(old wiring, custom ducting, etc), but Fix My RV held to the estimate with no additional charges to fix all the items related to the age of our Motorhome.  Great Service!
5	I called others, but non called me back.    I checked Yelp and called Fix-My-RV, we made an apt when I would be home, he was right on time.   He fixed everything that needed to be done.  He had to order a new lock, when it came in he called me and come right over.  I am thrilled.  He also adjust my door for me.  I have been paying, what I felt was to much to have work done on my RV, in the past and I brought it to them.  He was very reasonable, for time spent, work done, and coming to me.  I will be using his service again if I need more work done.
