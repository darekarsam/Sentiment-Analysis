1	Horrible the waiter frank made us feel so uncomfortable with his comments. He was obviously drunk and was embarrassed us trying to get pretty girls to take pics. Creepy! We will never return
1	Disappointed. Waited a long time to come here. Guess when you're by yourself you don't rate any kind of decent service. Oh well, steak was good but I ordered medium  and got raw. They didn't even ask me how anything was.
2	My first experience was so awesome I couldn't wait to come back.  I thought best service, wine , food and atmosphere.  This time a total 180. Note to our waiter"listening skills"  Last time we split every dish was separated and equally plated. This time he hacked into the steak at the table. Presentation ruined! Steak knifes came after the steak, when does that happen in a steak house? When he came to check on us, it wasn't until I had to reach out to the manager. By that time all our food was cold. When the waiter came to apologize, he said if the chef had to slice it in the kitchen, it would be an extra charge. I challenge him to find that button on the POS  system. If that was not bad enough, when the check came the waiter was swarming around my table like a shark on the hunt. Clearly this experience was not about our celebration, but our waiter.
5	Crab cakes are the way to go for an appetizer. Steak was delicious, right temperature and blackened on the top. The service was fantastic, super friendly. Also the ambience is true to the old Las Vegas attitude. Best part yet Oscar's office is located here, must see!!
