5	Lube Shop is great for a quick oil change! Morales is the owner and will remember you and get to know you!
5	I will continue to go back to this Guy again and again. He has done my oil changes almost ever since I got my car. He also changed my power steering tubes. Once you get to know him he will help you out a lot more. Morales is a Great Guy and knows how to run a business!
5	Very quick and Morales is very nice. He gave me a personal recommendation for an auto glass place for my cracked windshield! I will come here regularly as no appointment was even necessary. I'm a last minute kinda gal!
5	Morales is THE MAN! Always in & out lickety-split. I bring my own exotic oil & filter, pay $20 for labor only. Well worth it to keep from having to crawl under the car in my driveway then have to dispose of the old oil properly. He's not a butcher like the "technicians" at that chain oil change place that I don't need to mention by name. Highly recommended!
