2	Yeah, idk what's going on with the stylists at this location. There was one girl that worked there that was really good and I haven't seen her in months. I guess she quit and went to a Sports Clips. Any time Supercuts gets a good employee they wind up quitting and going somewhere else. It's so sad. Anyway, the last 2 haircuts I got here were pure crap...I mean, they were uneven and weren't even what I asked for. Granted, my hair is a little difficult since it grown in like 50 different directions...it doesn't seem like the stylists care or really analyze someone's hair before they start chopping at it. It seems like Supercuts must be a terrible company to work for since employees keep quitting and the ones that do work there seem like they don't care. I'm sure there's real talent currently employed there but doesn't seem like the company is tapping into that talent. I'm definitely going to try a different place. Ya know, for just a few $$ more you can go to a full service salon.

It's about 5 minutes away from my house as well, so that's a huge bonus. Always a good idea to call ahead... Who likes waiting for a half-hour plus-some for a trim? I don't. Place is clean and pleasant, I usually have a coupon too for the $10.99 hair cut. What a deal.
1	This is the worst hair cutting shit hole I've ever been to! The stylist and front desk lady were rude and seemed rushed because they didn't want to help out a customer or cut someone's hair. My hair cut was uneven and way shorter than what I asked for not to mention they can never line up my side burns evenly like how hard is it?! I could probably cut my own hair better than any of these rude nasty stylist in definitely never going here again! I'd rather pay more money for better service and quality work!
