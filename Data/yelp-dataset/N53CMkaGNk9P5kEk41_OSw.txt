1	BEWARE: GET A SECOND OPINION!!!!!!! Made appointment with there franchise 1-800 number, and was told appointment would be like $68 for new patient cleaning, exam and ex-ray. When i got there, i confirmed with receptionist that it would be $68 (not sure if this is exact amount but I'll use it as an example). Was told I had 10 cavities and needed a deep cleaning. Then when i went to pay, the receptionist tried to tell me the visit was like $85! She corrected it when i told her that wasn't what i was quoted. 2 months later, i go to a different dentist, highly recommended by my coworkers. He has been a dentist for 30 years. He tells me i have ONLY 1 cavity (not 10!!) and did not need a deep cleaning at all!!!! Please please please, save yourself TIME AND MONEY and get a second opinion!!!!

5	LOVE, LOVE DR. KHAIRAH!  I am a super baby when it comes to going to the dentist.  Anxiety attack city!  I had a deep cleaning and didn't feel a thing!  He took the time to make sure my mouth was numb, and was extremely gentle and thorough.    The staff are super friendly, and I will never go to another dentist as long as he is anywhere within driving distance!  Love you doc!  And thank you!
3	The employees are friendly enough. I've only been here a couple times. My main complaint is it takes forever. I have to plan on being here hours.  Both times I waited over an hour after my appointment time to be seen and then more waiting in the back. It's crazy.
