5	So far good choice when needing to sell "19" flashy rims, in exchange for new tires. One stop shop. They will buy your old tires if their in good shape.
5	The best service you going to get in the Queen City .. The staff is great and they answer your question
5	This place was GREAT. I had already had a place in mind that I was gonna go to. While driving there I saw this spot and decided to check it out. There were already people waiting so I figured Id have to do the same. Spoke with the guy about buying one used tire. They had my car size and 20 minutes and $35 later, I was on my way. Friendly, Fast, and Cost Effective.
1	STAY AWAY, Depo sold me two used tires 4 days ago and my front end now has a vibration.  I took it back to them and they rotated the tires to rear of vehicle  because they said i had a bent rim and still has a vibration and wanted to charge me $20.00 for rotation(what a joke).After this, I took my vehicle to another tire place and they stated that the rim is not bent and the guy at depo lied to me. The other tire place also told me that the used tire that depo sold me is egg shaped and not round and that is the reason for vibration.  I tell this story so others are not taken advantage of, like I was.Ps: Depo has a no warranty policy on used tires
