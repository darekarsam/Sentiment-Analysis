4	A decent little hot sauce shop. They sell their own product, as well as other companies. What is unique about the shop that I have not seen anywhere else is that they sell plants and seeds well. Go and try some sauces in the tasting area, see if you like it. Knowledgeable staff, that know much about peppers they do the sauce. They do internet sales as well, just in case you're just passing through.
5	Smokin' Ed has grown the world's hottest pepper, the Carolina Reaper for the past few years.  It was officially certified by Guinness in 2013 and reconfirmed in early 2014.  This is one hot pepper obviously.  i tried it at a Yelp event but will not be doing that again.They make their own hot sauces in the store with a variety of peppers and also sell some other unique brands.  The staff is very friendly.  The prices on some of the sauces are somewhat high, but this is one thing where you get what you pay for.  If you're in Fort Mill and are a spicy food fanatic, stop into Puckerbutt.
5	If you're anywhere near the area, you need to stop here.  And by "near the area", I mean within 30 minutes (having driven down from Charlotte, myself)Fantastic sauces, great people, and usually something new to try every time.  Ended up taking home some of their Lemon Pepper Jelly this time.  AMAZING!
5	The most amazing hot sauce store you will find anywhere in the Carolinas. Right on Main Street cool little shop. Sweetest guys you'll ever know!  The owner; Ed Currie and his gang of pepper master work the pots in the back and make sauces by hand all day from their home grown peppers.  Smokin Ed holds SC'S only Guinness Book of World Records Certificate for the World's Hottest Pepper; The Reaper. It's a scorcher brothers and sisters! They also sell jams, bbq sauces, and salsa, and cool chocolate reaper candies to trick your friends with. Not everything is hot and the prices are reasonable.  I absolutely love going in here. It's the pepper bomb!
