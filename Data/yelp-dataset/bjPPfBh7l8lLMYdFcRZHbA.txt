4	Complete Petmart is like a miniature PetSmart or PETCO.  We stopped in one day after shopping at Trader Joe's next door.  I was surprised to find out that they were actually a small chain; I had never heard of them before.  The store felt and looked like an independent store, but they had a lot of similar stuff.  We didn't buy anything at the time, but noticed that prices were comparable, so if you lived in the area, you could easily go to Complete Petmart instead of driving further to one of the pet giants.

3	The Complete Petmart was recently bought by PETCO - I didn't realize it until last weekend when I was at Trader Joe's and wandered over to see what was new.I have shopped here a couple of times for shampoos, toys, and accessories.  However, I have never bought my dog's food here since I usually get that at Earthfare. But, since I just found a $5 offf coupon for PETCO, I'll think I'll stop in again to see if they carry the Organic All-Natural dog food that I buy.
3	Recently acquired by Petco, the Complete Petmart is still a great resource for pet lovers and owners in South Charlotte. With the hundreds of pet food brands on the market, it's just impossible for any store this size to carry them all. But in my opinion, they have an excellent stock representing all price points and feeding philosophies. As a person who is extremely picky about the foods my pets eat, I was quite impressed that they carry so many high-end "boutique" pet food brands (such as Solid Gold, Wellness, Merrick, etc.) Their pet supplies area is a little lacking. I had a hard time finding the right chews for my pet, and I found the leashes/collars selection to be pretty boring. But I purchased a collar and tag there, anyway, so it must have been good enough : )Definitely worth checking out if you own pets and don't want to travel across town.
