3	Meh. Hadn't been to this Outremont fixture in years, but we were craving mussels after a long drive to Montreal, so off we went.I don't think there will be another visit. Mussels are available in about 30 different kinds of broth. One of ours - Italian - was acceptable (but a bit dull); the other - Catalan - was completely boring. The huge portion of fries that came with the mussels tasted like they came out of a Sysco bag (feh) and quickly got cold.Service was indifferent. Wine was nice - best thing about the meal.
4	Came on a Thursday night and the place was rather empty, which I was grateful for, but it did fill up over the course of the evening. Some of the best mussels I have had so far in Montreal. The decor is not exciting by far but it's comfortable and spacious. I ordered a Salade Verte/Green Salad, came with house dressing, was fresh and quite tasty. Bread was sliced baguette, fresh and crunchy! For my main meal I ordered mussels with garlic cream sauce which came with a side of frites and it was delicious. To accompany my meal I chose a glass of white wine---Fume Blanc, Errazuriz from Chile--excellent! Ordered a cappuccino and a piece of chocolate cake with chocolate coulis for dessert. Good coffee, but could've passed on dessert, nothing special. A definite do for mussels and frites!
4	Really good selections of muscles. The fries and green salad are excellent.The steak tartar and the steak are surprisingly tasty.I would definitely go back there.
