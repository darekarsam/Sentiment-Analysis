3	This place is pretty tasty, and adorably decorated in a vaguely insane and elaborate way. The decor matches the level of display in the food, which is primarily brunches, sandwiches and baked goods. Someone here loves the decorative and has a flair for presentation. The food is also fresh and the flavours are tasty. It's only 3 stars because the service is a little somber and slow. I've ordered food there and then heard one owner (brother?) tell the other a good 15 minutes later what the order was and that he'd have to go buy missing ingredients in the market. To be fair, that process doesn't take long with the market right there but still, made me laugh and raise my eyebrows a bit. If you're in the market and hungry it's definitely an option.
4	I was surprisingly happy with my sandwich. Tasty and well plated. Service was good too. I'll be back!
5	Great vibe in a very original Euro cafe with the most colorful plates. Excellent coffee, soundtrack, and fresh everything since it's right on Marche Jean Toulon (Market). Go!
