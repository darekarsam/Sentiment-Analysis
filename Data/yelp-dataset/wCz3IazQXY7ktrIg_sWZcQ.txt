5	I went to Oro Toro with my Hubby tonight! Well located across the street from Namur metro. It's way at the back, past the Suzy Shier, etc. We had a Tuango coupon for an amazing full course dinner for 2 people. The food was great and there is a super wide variety on the menu. I'd say there has to be something for everyone. For the appetizer I ordered the house-made  potato chips with the blue cheese sauce. After giving them a fair try, I did not like it and the *very nice* waiter offered me another appetizer! I was so impressed! So in replacement for that I took the Oro Toro Dip (goat cheese [there wasn't too much], cream cheese, peppers, mushrooms accompanied with tortilla chips and baguette bread). That time round it was good. Next was the main meal. I chose the Baked Atlantic Salmon with the choice of a side (I picked the house salad, which was great). The meal was awesome. Then as part of the coupon we had dessert. I picked the White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie and my Hubby had the cheesecake. The cheesecake slice was surprisingly thin. Very thin... almost nothing to it - maybe because we were using a coupon and we paid less? I don't know. My pie was good, not great, but good.The waiter was attentive and clearly knew how to handle customers. He had personality to boot. We were welcomed into the seating area right away. Overall I gave this resto 5 stars because it met my three most critical criteria for a "return-worthy" rating:1- Good Service; 2- Quality Food or Product; 3- Reasonably Priced.I'd also like to add that this restaurant is a GREAT pick for a romantic evening. Thanks for reading!
