5	I just picked up my new eyeglasses here after previously buying my last set of eyeglasses and two pairs of sunglasses at this location in the Fashion Show mall.  Service has always been stellar, with much individual attention.  The latest styles are always on display.  And, prices are high but fair for the top designer eyewear being offered.  Here you are not sold a product and then forgotten.  I have regularly come in for free eyeglass or sunglass adjustment that has always been cheerfully provided.  And, preparation of ordered eyewear has always been quick.  I was promised my new TAGHeuer frames with prescription progressive and transition lenses within two weeks, and they were ready within one!  I highly recommend this business for discerning nearsighted or farsighted shoppers who want to look their best but don't have the patience for the hassle that accompanies dealing with contact lenses.  Or, like me, would be inclined to constantly misplace and lose these tiny transparent discs.
5	Great help this morning!! My daughter tore a contact while we were in Las Vegas and the folks here were able to help us and get us back to our vacation in less than 15 min!!!  Thank you!!!!!
