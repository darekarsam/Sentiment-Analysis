5	Next Morning service.... Showed the problem to us and instead of trying to sell us a bunch of stuff we did not need... He just fixed it with a minimum of product and service.. There are some bad apples in this business like any other. Mike was a true pro... Glad He put his sticker on my garage door... He will be the guy I call...
5	Sometimes it's hard to tell how good a company is until something goes wrong. We had a commercial door installed at my carpet cleaning company. Everything went great from the quote to the installation. Good communication and good service.Unfortunately, the chain pull on the door has given us issues.FORTUNATELY, this is a top-notch company that responded quickly to my complaints and fixed the issues, even though it was a year after we did the installation of the door. Great customer service.
1	Would not recommend using this company.  They will write up anything you ask them to on an invoice, and do some sketchy business.  Would go elsewhere for the integrity.
5	Our garage door has been acting up for several months and we finally made the decision to call out a professional to handle the issue.  Diamond Garage Doors gave us a courtesy call, showed up on time and fixed our issue with minimal time and cost.  I would certainly recommend them to others.
1	They claim to auto generate comments from a computer to avoid answering for their actions.  No integrity or honesty with these guys what so ever.
