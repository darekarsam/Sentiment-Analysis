4	Very international crowd in this inexpensive Chinese joint.Great Cantonese Chow Mein, and very friendly service.  The restaurant's open late (forgot how late) and was fairly crowded even at the odd hour of 9:30 on a weeknight.Most dishes in the $6-$9 range.
3	A good mix between Chinese and Vietnamese cuisine. The menu prices were definitely cheap for the portions, but decor inside was hole-in-the-wallish.
2	I went there once, nothing special. I think Soup and Noodles across the street really kills their business.
