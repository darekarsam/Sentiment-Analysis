5	Seriously had to downsize my living space in my last move and didn't have a place to put everything.  Found this place nearby and was thrilled by the 2 months free deal.  Great customer service.  Chris was a doll!  Clean unit with great security and elevator access right to my unit.  Chris made the move in process so easy.  I definitely would recommend Smart Bargain.  Thanks Chris!
5	For price..best in town...customer service outstanding...cleanliness outstanding...overall this is the place to be to store items.
5	Very nice and accommodating! Highly recommend. Air conditioned storage, lots of different storage room sizes, elevator, secure, inexpensive, and they usually have great deals!  I can't believe the price considering how nice this place is. Plus they use solar energy which is amazing!!
5	Unbelievably inexpensive.  They are running various specials right now that will blow you away.  I literally felt like I got away with robbery.  This place is fantastic.  Great customer service, air conditioned units, friendly atmosphere, it just can't be beat.
5	Dean, the manager, is amazing!!!  I have rented from other storage places before, but this has been the best experience.  At the other places I was just a number, but Dean makes it a point to remember everyone's name.  The place is clean and kept up.  As for the prices, can't beat them.
5	Great, fast, painless, and most of all FRIENDLY experience thank you Mike the Manager there; good price for what we're getting also. I definitely recommend this place...
