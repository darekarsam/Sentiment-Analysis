5	What an incredible find! This little gem is everything you want in a BBQ place. Friendly atmosphere. AMAZING FOOD. The BBQ is killer (whoever their cook is must be a meat master!) and the kitchen chef is outstanding (ask for rice and homemade salsa/tomatillo sauce). You cannot beat the price. Make sure you know the secret knock, you can handle your liquor, and you know your music for Apple TV Battles.
3	Is this place someone's house?? This address took is into a neighborhood. I'm confused I can't give any stars really.
5	Best food I've had thus far! The friendly atmosphere and great service is one of a kind! The food is bar none the best mix food I've ever had!
