4	TiYA TiYA TiYA!  OMG hot stone massage is my new favorite thing ever.  This is one amazing masseuse.  Also Robert is the only hairdresser I've maybe EVER had that I didn't feel awkward talking to through the whole styling experience.  Even if he hadn't done a great job on my hair, I would go back to him just for that.
1	Sad news...the salon has gone out of business. Any suggestions for a quality style and cut downtown?
