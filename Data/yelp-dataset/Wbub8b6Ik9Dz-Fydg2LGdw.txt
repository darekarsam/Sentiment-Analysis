4	The guys who run this fun home decor store couldn't be greater.  If you have a question, they'll readily look up the answer for you on their computer or in a vendor catalog.  They focus on using recycled or renewable materials.  For example, I learned today (at home-ology) that mango wood is a sustainable resource, because mango trees eventually quit producing fruit, and the trees are often cut down and destroyed by the growers.  But the wood is attractive, and is now being used to produce furniture, lamps, and other home accessories.  They have a fun line of reusable shopping bags (so cute) and these awesome fragrance lamps that are beautiful and fill your home with a wonderful scent.
5	The owners of this store are truly businessmen that I would trust. On top of the wonderful products they always have, they also offer great advice when decorating your home.I recommend their business to anyone. At least stop by and check out what they have to offer.
5	Homeology has a lot of great and interesting items. Ryan and Chris are great people. They are very friendly and knowledgeable about the different products that they sell. I really recommend this location.
