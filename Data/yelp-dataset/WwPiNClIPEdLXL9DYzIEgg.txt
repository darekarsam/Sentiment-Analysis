5	I MUST endorse Katie's Review!  She was so distraught when her beloved dog went missing, and Copyfast Printing jumped in to offer their services with beautiful color Flyers!  Ian will never know how much Katie and her support team appreciated his kindness, during that 5 day ordeal!  KUDOS TO IAN & COPYFAST PRINTING!
5	I cannot say enough great things about Copyfast!  When it comes to award winning service and product production - they are at the top of my list.  It is nice to know that family-oriented, specialized copy centers still exist!  I had the opportunity to meet the owners one day, although at that time - I did not know that they owned Copy Fast.  After a brief chat with them - I can see why their copy center is the best in town.  I knew I loved this place before, but now after meeting them and hearing about the passion they have for their store, their customers and their employees - I am even more thrilled that I have this place to go to for all my copy needs!
