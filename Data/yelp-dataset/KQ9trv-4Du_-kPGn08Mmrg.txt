5	Well worth the money!!  Melanie is so professional and knowledgeable!  My child was sent home from school this morning due to lice. I was freaked out and called ProLice Mom and Melanie was at my house within two hours.  She treated my daughter very thoroughly with all natural products and calmed my nerves and was able to answer all of my questions.  I would highly recommend her service!  It was definitely the well worth $80!!
5	Melanie is incredible!!! I cannot say enough good things about our experience. She checked our whole family, treated the one child with lice and, most importantly, educated us. In third grade, I had lice and it was a traumatic experience filled with chemicals and fear. Melanie completely changed that experience this time to one with information and non-toxic essential oils. She takes the time to make you the expert, giving you the tools for success so you never have to deal with the issue again if you are proactive. Thank you, thank you, thank you!
