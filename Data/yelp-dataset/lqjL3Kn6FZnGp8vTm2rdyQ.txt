5	I'm not sure why Yelpers haven't found this place! My roommate and I have been wanting to try something new and this place was always a mystery so we gave it a shot. Don't let the outside scare you. It looks a little dumpy and even looks a little dumpy and cold when you get inside. Trust me, stick with it and put a jacket on in the winter. We ordered a side of sweet fried plantains as an appetizer. There were at least 25 pieces for $2.99 and they were delicious. Our food came out on large white square plates and our presentation was very nice. Our food was phenomenal and everything was really unique too. Our bills were only $10 split both ways and we had a lot of leftovers. After just going to Ruth's Chris for restaurant week and spending $50 on a meteokre meal, I was reminded that good food and fellowship can happen over a $10 meal too. Definitely give this place a shot!
3	I really did not plan on eating Mexican/Salvadoran/Honduran last night. Our favorite and second favorite pho destinations were inexplicably closed and Morazon beckoned from barely a parking lot away. Don't let the converted fast food location and uncrowded interior fool you.    Morazan is worth seeking out. We pointed randomly and did not try a quesadilla, taco or burrito (although all are on the long, colorful menu). We had plantains stuffed with meat, beans, cheese (highly recommend) puposas and few other randomly selected items  I can not remember. Nothing was over $4 - and these are not small plates- another than the gigantic shrimp ceviche at $10. Ice water came with limes -I love little things like hat. Service was gone a lot but very friendly. Would have liked a few more menu suggestions for people clearly out of place like us. The manager did stop by our table to check-in which was a nice touch. Give this place a try for an affordable trip to Mexican/South American cusine.
