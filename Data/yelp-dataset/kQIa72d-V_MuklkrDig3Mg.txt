3	You know, I actually like Rock's.  Especially in the summer when it's not too crowded and the outdoor seating is available.  It's a bar, it's clean, and it probably has the best nachos in cu (last night I ate two portions, which is embarrassing because thy are HUGE!)
3	Not bad.  Rock's is a decent bar/pub/grill/patio spot that is pleasant in the summer heat.  The beers are nice and cold, with a decent selection, and it's hard to find fault in that place.  It doesn't strike me as exceptionally standout, but it's a solid dining location.
4	At first glance, Rocks may seem like at the other bars around the U of I campus. I can tell you right now that you are very wrong. Rocks is definitely a cut above the other bars and pubs for a couple reasons. They first major thing you notice is that they, unlike most other places in the area, have ample parking and you don't have to drive around forever looking for street parking. Second, the bar has a much better atmosphere for watching the big game. Everyone tends to run to Kams or the like to watch the game, but people who know better go to Rocks. Lastly, they serve the best horseshoes anywhere near campus. My friends and I would go to Rocks just to get horseshoes. You really have to go just to try one.
