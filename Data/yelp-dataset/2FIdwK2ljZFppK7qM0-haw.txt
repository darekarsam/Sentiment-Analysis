4	Nice place, easy accessed.  Amazing paintings on the wall! Very friendly service. It is a classy place, with a very interesting menu. Good selection of wild game meats. Degustation menu @120$ for 2 is a great value. Ingredients are fresh and very well cooked. The only caveat, I would say, is that the wine list is not very original, and quite pricey. Worth the detour for a friendly delicious meal.
