4	Great gallery, wonderful classes. I enjoy their exhibits and gallery openings. Very good staff with passion and expertise for photography.
4	Another little hidden gem in the South Side.  I've stopped by for a few recent exhibits (Dawoud Bey's class pictures and Isa Leshko's elderly animals) this year.  Again, a place I ignored when I lived in the South Side and I'm not sure why.  When I've been the place is remarkably quiet - I could have used some music.  But it's a simple gallery where you can walk through and no one bothers you (at least when I'm there). My interest in the exhibits is truly what finally got me inside the door after all these years.  Silver Eye is open and free to the public.  Worth a stop if you're nearby and it won't take up much of your time.
1	Maybe their exhibits are decent, but their service for members is certainly not. I paid $50 membership fee and provided all my contact information and email address. Never received any communication regarding upcoming events, classes, discounts etc. The only email they cared to respond to was how to pay the membership fee. Never a response to my other inquiry emails. Not recommend to become a member.
