1	We just bought a car from a private seller. They got the oil  changed before the put it up for sale (very nice of them), and they warned us that when they got the oil changed the car's accordion tube coming out of the air filter was covered in duct tape, when confronted the service people said they had no idea. Then I took it in for my mechanic to look over and the oil cap was busted and they showed it to me to ask if I wanted them to cut it off, because that was the only way to get it off! I asked the sellers where they had taken it and if they knew about the damage, they said Big O in Centennial Hills, and they had no idea.I know the sellers, so I believe them and am not impressed by shady mechanics :(

5	We  had a blow out on the freeway and these guys took care of us.  We crippled in on our spare and though they were busy, they helped us as fast as they could and gave us great advice.  They didn't have the tire, but hunted down just the right one.  Super impressed.
1	This place is the worst! Go elsewhere! I brought my car in here over a year ago for an issue. Left it there overnight. Get a call from them the next day telling me they couldn't find the problem I brought it in for but said I needed new brakes. Wth?! Other crap went down with this repair place afterwards but I won't bore you with the details. Just go elsewhere.
