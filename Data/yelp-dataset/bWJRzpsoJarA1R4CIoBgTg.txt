4	Really happy to see these guys bringing something good to St Laurent. The new room is in the old Euro Deli location, right above Prince Arthur. It's all wood and exposed brick and a lunch menu that gives you a pile of pulled pork or mac and cheese with sausage and a side salad or fries and a beer for $13. It's warmer and higher-end feeling than the place on St Denis (currently closed due to fire) and it's definitely high on the short list of places where I would actually hang out on lower St Laurent. Same smoked and bbq'd meat and nice staff and general joyful focus on trying to do something delicious and great downtown. Good folks, go say hi!
4	Had a good time. went with my teenage son.atmosphere was nice. service was excellent.my waitress was very friendly. refilled my soft drink before I asked. best service I had in a long time.my son had a hamburger and fries he really liked it.I had the ribs fries and coleslaw. the coleslaw I think it's homemade very good.The only down part was the french fries I think they should work on that.besides that everything was perfect. I would give it five stars.  but like I said they have to do something about the french fries.Definitely will return.

5	...Damn, you are the ultimate seduction... Master of grabbing my soul and my tummy and making me leave my heart in this place.Damn, your perfectly crispy and not over-salted fried pickles. Damn, your perfection on a plate in a form of moist brisket over-loaded on a crispy bun. Damn, your yummiest BBQ sauce and sides that are sinful in their deliciousness.Damn, your endless beers on tap and old-fashioned that rocked my world into oblivion. Damn, your cute waitress and decor that goes with a mood on cold winter day.Damn you for being so perfect, but so far away, Diablos.Love for eternity & beyond.
