2	This is clearly for visitors of the City who don't have time or cannot be bothered to head to Loch Ness itself. Add some 3D and some fairytales (or scientific evidence- whatever way you want to look at it) you get to see hand on evidence around the myths surrounding this loch. Most of the evidence comes from the (slightly derranged) individuals who spent a lot of time looking at the lake. Or devising machines to proove their point. You can proove anything with facts these days. And photos.After your Loch Ness Discovery troop over to the Loch itself if you have time. You are going to spend the first 5-15 minutes starring at it as well, convinced that  that movement in the distance is Nessie herself. That's ok we have all done that- half-jocking or so we pretend to.
