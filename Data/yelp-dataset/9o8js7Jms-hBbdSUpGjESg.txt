5	I absolutely love this place! My husband and I decided to branch out and try other Brazilian steakhouses. I thought they were good and then we went back to TDB and there was no comparison! There salad bar is way better than the other places we tried. Service is always very good as well. Loyal fan!
5	if you love meat then this place is made specially for you, prepare to be swarmed by carvers generously serving various cuts of seasoned beef, filet mignon (bacon covered or by itself) , lamb, pork, chicken and Brazilian sausage, all accompanied by traditional side items and house-baked Brazilian cheese bread (which by the way is  awesome when dipped into their lobster bisque) , so much food you want to come back and try it all, great list wines and awesome deserts, the ambiance is great for casual, business, celebration and romantic occasions.
5	Sooo delicious. I recently had my first Brazilian steakhouse experience here, and it was absolutely delightful. Even if you don't eat a lot of meat, the salad bar was exquisite!! I am a bit of a lobster bisque snob, and I went back for it two times. I need to come back more often!!!
1	We had dinner with my husband and my son here. So disappointed with the service our server Anne D never attend to our needs we have to ask her couple of times or get it ourselves. She never initiate to offer us anything we were at the table for more than 20 minutes she never offer anything then I asked her to give us drinks, caramelized banana and mashed potato even if we already asked her she didn't pay attention to it we have to ask her again.
5	This place is amazing! Friendly staff, good vibe, and of course delicious food. Make sure you have an empty stomach and a huge appetite. If you're a meat lover, this place is perfect for you. Everything is so flavorful; meats, side dishes, and dessert. When it's time for dessert, the Brazilian cheesecake is a must try. It's not too sweet, it was just right. Awesome restaurant!
