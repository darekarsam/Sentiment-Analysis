5	Destination Scuba is more than a place to check off an item on your Bucket List, although it is the perfect place to do so. The DS team is fun, friendly and are passionate about sharing their passion with others. I love that they emphasize fun, adventure and safety. They also make trips just for you! I totally trust Destination Scuba to handle my next vacation.
5	Top notch business! Such warm and loving people.
5	A few years ago, I tried scuba diving on vacation in a resort and it was a very stressful situation for me. I wasn't sure if I would ever try scuba again. A friend of mine told me about Destination Scuba and it changed my perspective on the world of scuba diving. Before I was afraid of scuba and felt rushed because I never had the chance to learn at my own pace. Destination Scuba was the complete opposite and has great instructors that know how to handle a scared little guppy like me! The ocean can be overwhelming, but also amazing and beautiful and given the chance to learn the basics of scuba with calm dive instructors who want me to enjoy it just as much as they do- it was just priceless! Another cool aspect of Destination Scuba, they live up to their name! They plan many dive vacations throughout the year in tropical destinations. Sounds like the perfect excuse for a trip to the Bahamas- if you ask me!
5	CG/Tania run a great scuba shop. Clean with the latest gear and great customer service. Their scuba socials and scuba labs are a great way to connect with other divers. Looking forward to a scuba trip with them soon
