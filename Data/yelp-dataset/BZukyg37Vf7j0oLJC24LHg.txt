3	I tried this place out after seeing a friend order a sandwich from here. I looked up their menu and found some unique and delicious sounding choices. I had their buffalo chicken sub and it was about average.The toppings and bread tasted fresh and the chicken good. However, I was a little disappointed with the buffalo sauce. It was not as tasty as some I've had and it was drenched throughout the sandwich. The service was fast and friendly.I will probably return and try some other subs they have on the menu but I'll pass on the buffalo chicken.

2	I recently ordered Erbert & Gerbert's online and got a sub, chips and a cookie for $5.99 as a part of an online deal. My order came at a reasonable time and the chips and cookie were great. The sub however was extremely disappointing. I ordered the sweet chili vegetarian sub and they gave me the wrong bread. I didn't mind that too much except the quality of the sub was mediocre. The sweet chili sauce, somehow, was hard to consume and soaked the entire sandwich. The sub was also horribly light, as there were maybe 2 cucumbers, one slice of cheese and a small handful of lettuce on it. I'll never order from here again. I'll stick with Jimmy John's!
