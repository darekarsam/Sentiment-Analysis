1	This place is G H E T O O !!!  Don't waste your time with this place.  Sure, there might be a deal here and there, but the quality is sacrificed big time.  The produce section is in horrible shape; most items are withered or even rotting.  Trust me, go somewhere else!
2	I gave this location such a low rating because the store is usually a mess. Having worked in supermarkets before I've noticed that products you think would be in the same aisle are in a completely irrelevant spot. Their shelves need to be reset in a better manner.
1	The only time to come here, (If you desperately have to) is early in the morning. As the sun starts going down the store starts getting worse and worse until all the freaks and ghouls come out at night. I never let my mother go by herself here. Its too dangerous.
4	This location isn't as bad as everyone says it is. I've been shopping here since I can remember and I never once had any issue.
