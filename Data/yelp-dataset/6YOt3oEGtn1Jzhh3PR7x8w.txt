4	Coffee and  maple  donut is my favorite here!  Tim Horton's is similar to Winchels, a variety of freshly baked donuts that you can find at Winchel's, however I would say if there was any difference, the doughiness of the donuts seemed to be a different, maybe a little more doughy, and also I believe the sweetness is just a tad held back, which is a good thing.   My only complaint is that this particular one, the dining area was a little unkept and messy, but overall this is a great donut shop, so I'd say this is one of Montreal's gems!
