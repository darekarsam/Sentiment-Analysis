1	Just dont go. This place sucks. I went when I was very intoxicated the first time and the food was blah. Went totally sober for a good breakfast and the food was even worse. The fist time i got chicken fingers and fries, the chicken fingers were o-k but the worst was that they had NO sauces for the fingers......except this runny bbq sauce that was utterly disgusting. When we went for breakfast on our last day it was just so bad. I ordered your typical eggs, toast,sausage. I only got 2 small sausages, weak ass scrambled eggs and some shotty fruit. the only good part was the toast that was buttered with jam lol. Our breakfast server was awesome though but the food just sucks so hard, no wonder why they arent in toronto anymore. lol
1	DO NOT GO HERE!Foods is gross, Service is terrible.We came here expecting some hot and delicious breakfast! It was probably the worst breakfast ever lol Rude waitress, Paper bacon, plastic eggs, cardboard pancakes, water syrup etc...Why is this diner even in business??
1	Avoid this place and if u must go and are american and jonathan is your server, walk out. Absolutly no reason to wait 10 min to be acknowledged. 20 min for our order to be taken and 40 min for it to come out just to have the chicken raw and the salad brown and slimy.  Avoid at all costs!!!!Oh and the food poisioning from the raw chicken!!!
4	Better than expected. Cheap. Fun. Good. Get tipsy before your movie and bring a date. Don't expect the royal treatment and get over yourself. Decent calamari and very huge sandwich/wrap portions. Overall, a very good value.
