5	Staff are very helpful and willing to assist you with anything you need. In fact, they'll notice if you're struggling with anything and will come over and ask you if you need any other help with things. A greeter is always at the door, cheerily saying hi to everyone walking in and offering help. Products are great and staff are knowledgable about which products are best for each person.
5	I love everything at The Body Shop and can't help but stop by every time I'm in the Eaton Center.Staff is always helpful and informs you of their new products or promotions. The Body Shop regularly has sales, like everything 50% off, or buy 2 get one free,  as well as events where you can "spin the wheel" to reveal a discount or free item,A couple times a year, all the stores in the Eaton Center have some sort of "sidewalk" sale where they display products on a table in front of the store and you can snag some beloved goodies like their body butters for 5$ (instead of regular price: 20$)That's also when they bring back some limited editions or old collections, like blueberry, grapeseed, almond... Great time to stock up!Quality products, mouth watering scents and great deals, if you come often enough to see em ;)
