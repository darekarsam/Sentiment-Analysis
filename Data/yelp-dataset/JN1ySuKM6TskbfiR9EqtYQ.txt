4	Love this branch! Every time I have had an issue with  my account or needed some questions answered I have always gotten assistance quickly. Last time I was in I even had the branch manager help me. Super nice!If you need a bank in the area this one for sure knows what customer service is!
4	Love this branch.  Since I live right down the street, I come to this branch as often as I can be.  This location used to be a 2-story restaurant / night club when the neighborhood was in development.  But since this is a family community, the business didn't do all that good so it was closing and then later I learned that it's going to be a Chase Bank and I was so happy that there's finally going to be a Chase Bank in my neighborhood.  I used to have to drive all the way to Tatum Blvd. & Bell Rd.  The only bad thing about this branch is that there aren't any safe deposit boxes so I will have to go to another branch for that service.  Overall services was great.  Definitely recommend you to visit this branch if you are in this area.
5	It took Chase less than 30 days to accomplish what US Bank couldn't do in 4 months.  Unlike US Bank, Chase's loan process is efficient and not run by a bunch of idiots.  I started my application online, was contacted promptly, and assigned to a physical branch.  Everybody I had the pleasure of speaking with was very informative, had the answers I needed (or could get them), and kept their promises.  Everybody from their central location (wherever they process the applications) down to the branch were very professional and knew how to take care of business.  I'm glad to be a member of this financial institution and wish other banks I work with would get on the ball.
5	Quick, friendly service.  Best Chase branch i have been to as of yet.  I had trouble cashing a check at another Chase. I come here and they cash it for me in under 2 minutes!  Great job ladies!
