4	I like this gym.  I've been going since before they moved to the current location and they have done a great job at making it a clean club w/good equipment at an affordable price.  Good atmosphere to exercise, they have a basketball court that's great for shooting around before or after a workout and they have decent classes.  I looked at the Y and Club Fitness across the street b/c my membership contract ends this month and I decided to stay w/ZX.
4	I mainly use the ZX Southpark location since its less than 5 mins from me but gave the Steele Creek location a try since I was on that side of town. Gym is huge, cardio is completely separate from the weights. I prefer free weights but theres an incredible amount of brand new machines in this facility. Everything you need, and I like that its very spread out.I didn't check out the basketball court, or go into the locker rooms but overall the club appeared very clean and well kept. I used their tanning bed and it looked brand new, once again room was clean and well kept.
1	Horrible customer service.
