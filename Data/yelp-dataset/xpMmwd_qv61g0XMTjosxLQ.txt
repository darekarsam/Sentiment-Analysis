5	Love this place! My mom has taken her pets here for a long time and I take mine here too! They are patient and caring! The fact that they can trim my Beagles nails and she has no problems with them whatsoever shows how awesome they are! Good prices too!
2	My regular groomer was booked full so I took my dog here. I was coded $45 and charged $50. The cut was rough that I had to trim off uneven part to make it look a little better. What bothered me the most is the attitute of the lady who checked in my dog. I saw her smilling at other people, but to me it was cold and unwelcome feeling. I will not go back for sure.
5	Really, really helpful. We have two golden doodles. I didn't realize that when they go from puppies to adults their coats suddenly mats big time when the adult coat comes in. My first experience trying to get them groomed was with one of the chains and they scared the puppies so I didn't take them in right when their coats started getting bad. Finally I had to do something! I explained everything to the owner and she told me they could help. They ended up having to remove their coats like they were sheep. Because of their prior bad experience at the chain, the puppies (at this point over a year and big) were terrified. They were shaking like leaves. The owner was more than happy to let us stay with the puppies and actually hold them while their fur was being cut off. Poor things ended up looking like very big grey hounds. Not quite the look you expect for a doodle :)Both groomers were really helpful and amazingly nice. They even offered to give me and my kids grooming tips to make sure we don't have anymore big problems in the future. One of my son's (12) was there with me holding one of the puppies while he was buzzed and he came out of the ordeal still willing to go back! That was an unexpected bonus.The pups coats are coming back in beautifully and they are going back to be bathed and get a trim. Whew, what a relief to find people so good with dogs.
