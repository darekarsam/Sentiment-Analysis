4	Watched this show a few years ago. Great seating arrangement and a very entertaining show. Even if you know nothing about the Beatles!
5	I mean, you don't need to read my review to go here! It's the frickin' Beatles for frick's sake!  Without even reviewing the show, the theatre itself is a beautiful tribute to the band.  The gift shop's a little too pricy, but it also offers a great deal of merchandise I haven't otherwise seen.
5	If you weren't a Beatles fan before the show you will be after.  High energy amazing show.  Loved it! The Mirage does a great job with getting you in and out as well.
4	Love... is all you need; to have a great Vegas experience! This show is amazing, and one of my top favorite Cirque performances! This show is located at the GORGEOUS Mirage hotel. My friend and I parked at the self parking (which is sort-of tricky to find since you have to go down the Treasure Island parking, and the Mirage parking will be on your left hand side through a labyrinth of roads.) The stadium is GORGEOUS! It's a round stage, so every seat has a great view of the performance. I must admit, there is TOO much going on during the show to appreciate the individual stunts performed. It's a hodge podge, but beautiful scenes and performances none-the-less!This is an appropriate homage to The Beatles that can be enjoyed by all walks of life! I definitely recommend going to this performance on your next Vegas trip! Great deals can be found all-around for tickets, so make sure you're keeping an eye out! ;)
