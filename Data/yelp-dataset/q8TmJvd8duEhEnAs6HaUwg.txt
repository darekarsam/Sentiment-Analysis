4	I've had a soft spot for The Hospice Bookshop ever since I discovered a copy of Joshilyn Jackson's Gods in Alabama squashed inbetween other novels. Admittedly, it was the image of the open top car surrounded by open blue sky and white clouds that first caught my attention but it was the opening paragraph* that sealed the deal.Since then, I find it impossible to walk past the bookshop without a secret smile. Of course, I can't promise you'll discover one of your favourite books here but they do have a pretty good selection of fiction and biographies and the book are cheap, cheap, cheap. They also sell clothes and bric-a-brac and everything goes to a great cause. * 'THERE ARE GODS in Alabama: Jack Daniel's, high school quarterbacks, trucks, big tits, and also Jesus. I left one back there myself, back in Possett. I kicked it under the kudzu and left it to the roaches.' Joshilyn Jackson
