5	Great sub sandwiches. Love the number 16 that they have on the hot menu for sub sandwiches. I bring my family here and they love it too even the cold sandwiches.
5	Great service and food!!! Been a customer for years...  Chicken Parmesan sub... And there pizza sub are so yummy!!! always Fresh ingredients...
5	First time here. Food is fresh. Place is clean. Great customer service. Got the number 1 and my gf got the number 7. We love it. We'll be back for sure.
5	Best mom & pop pizza shop in the area. The owners are friendly and usually come check on you during your meal to ensure you are enjoying their food. The pizza special is a great deal, 2 slices of pepperoni & a drink for $5. I like to come here once a week for lunch. The place is always clean and they have good A/C too!
1	Sadly im completely disappointed in my experience with Submarinos. Bleh where do I start. Horrible food. The bread is dry and cheap and if you don't like dinning with bugs you're in for a surprise. Not only was the food crappy but the customer service was absolutely disrespectful. I instantly felt unwelcome as I walked in. You would think that the co owner of the restaurant would act as if she wanted you to come back. Instead I had to deal with her unprofessional attitude problem. Would definitely not suggest going there. Im never going back after being treated so badly.
4	When I am craving Italian food but don't want to do the cooking,  I come here.   The staff is always friendly and welcoming.  Best of all,  the food is tasty.
5	Very friendly people that own this place. Nice little mom and pop sandwich and pizza place. Wish they were open later!
5	Some of the best food I have ever eaten! I am in love with their turkey sandwich it is to die for, I'll never eat one from any other sub place! Today was my first time going to the actual store (I have tried a sandwich my parents brought home before) and the staff was nothing but friendly and very helpful  I plan on making a regular stop!
