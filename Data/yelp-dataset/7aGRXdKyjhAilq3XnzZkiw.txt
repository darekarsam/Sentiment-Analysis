5	We were referred here from a friend and I thank them everytime I go. I love the dentist, yeah I know, but when you can take your wife here and she loves the dentist too... you know it is good. Good staff, great dentist!
5	It has taken me a while to find a good dentist in this city and now I must say I have found the best dental office in Phoenix (.) Dr. Ortale and his staff are very friendly and outgoing. They are honest and straight forward, plus Dr. Ortale does wonderful work your smile will look better than ever, not to mention all the good music he plays in the clinic...not your boring elevator music that's for sure.  My wife and son also loves the office who just started up as new patients. Life long loyal patient :)
5	Dr. Ortale's office is well run with a friendly and knowledgeable staff that greets patients by name and with a smile as they walk through the door. Early appointment? Pour yourself a fresh cup of Joe upon entering the waiting area, but make it quick because this office is efficient and punctual! Dr. Ortale is a dentist who goes above and beyond to be sure his patients receive his focused care and attention to their needs. He is extremely thorough and is absolute about providing the best dental care possible.  Whether he is treating me or my small children, he demonstrates regard for each person's comfort and he has surrounded himself with hygienists that reflect the same level of care and professionalism.  North Point Dentistry is dental care for the entire family.
