4	First time at this group of hotels. Pretty new, only one in UK, another to open in Edinburgh and one in London. Rooms not very big but great price and location for a weekend in Edinburgh. Rooms clean, comfortable, good shower and free wifi!
4	This is a fairly new property I think. It is a German company and has most of the amenities you would want. It is priced on the budget minded side so it won't break your bank.Location is really good. Near the Royal Mile and Waverley station without being too noisy. Very easy to walk to everything we wanted to do. Has WiFi but we did have to re-log in every day.
4	Well, i like the idea of Motel One. Always in the center of the city, somehow modern design, good beds. No fancy unnecessary stuff. All of this is true for this motel one in Edinburgh. Perfectly located even if it's hard to discover. Breakfast is ok, but not more. Service is friendly. No twin rooms available..
