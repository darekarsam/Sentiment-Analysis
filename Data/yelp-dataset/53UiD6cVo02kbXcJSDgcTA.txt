5	A must stop everytime I am in Scottsdale.  A variety of styles, color purposefully decorated around the shop. And a good variety of price points. Friendly, welcoming staff
2	BEWARE!! 5 DAY RETURN POLICY! Yes, FIVE. That no one (owner or employee) will tell you about until you try to return something after 5 days, of course (because a standard return policy is 30 days). And they will point to the miniature exchange sign that is placed on the counter, along side another sign that has nothing to do with the business, and say that is the policy and that's where it's posted for customers to see it. I was shocked at such an absurd, terrible, highly inconvenient policy when I tried to return a sweater because when I purchased it not a single person, who works at or owns the store, offered even an "Are you familiar with our return policy?" Or a "Just so you know..."Aubrey apologized yet did nothing to truly rectify the situation. This store is quite cute, albeit out of the way (also hugely inconvenient for customers/returns); unfortunately the policy and customer service, or lack thereof, is highly disappointing.
5	Love going into this cute boutique! Everything is always displayed in a neat and organized matter. The sales associates are always very helpful and friendly.This place can be quite expensive, but they do have great sales sometimes!  I love it when they have half-off certain items, you can get good quality, adorable clothes without spending a ton of money. Their jewelry is also very reasonably priced, I have found some cool, unique accessories there that I wear all the time now. Also those candles..I need more!Pretty please is great for ladies with a colorful, trendy sense of style! I enjoy shopping here and would like to check out the other locations :)
