5	I've done a few of print jobs with Opportunitees over the past two years for various groups in our school (Biltmore Preparatory Academy) and Opportunitees has always done a great job with great speed, and at a great price.  Selena in the front office is always a phone call away and easily reachable, and Jay and Oscar do great work with the printing.  Their shop is well worth visiting too - interesting location on a pretty cool campus, with some great artwork in the shop.
5	I consistently have a positive experience when ordering t-shirts from Opportunitees for my work at Arizona State University. The staff are friendly and professional, the products are high quality with competitive pricing. I'm definitely a repeat customer!
5	I stumbled upon OpportuniTees quite accidentally and I'm so glad I did. We just had polo shirts for men and women, and tee shirts for men, women, and children, in a variety of sizes and colors, screen printed and embroidered. Our job was done within a timely manner and the finished product looks terrific. I needed some specialty sizes (tall and plus) and, unlike other shops in the Valley, OpportuniTees did not assess a significant upcharge on those sizes. We needed a shirt in a rush and Jay finished the entire Screen Job in one afternoon! The embroidery took just a couple of days longer, in part because Jay rejected the first digitization of our logo, and waited until it was just right before completing our job. All in all, our turn-around time was less than 2 weeks, which is above industry standards here in the Valley. I priced my job out with 5 companies in Phoenix and the nearby East Valley. OpportuniTees quote was about 10% less expensive than the next closest bid we received. I appreciate that they give back to the community by supporting Neighborhood Ministries.
