5	this little place was great! fun day with great jet skis...the older couple is extremely nice and made for an affordable fun time at the lake. I would highly recommend giving these guys a chance! they have the trailer hitch if you need and include many sized life jackets.
5	The owners Chris and joe were extremely nice. They took my reservation without a credit card. I rented two decent wave runners for $125 each for the whole day. $300 deposit on each. Brought them back at 5.30 in the same condition I picks them up. TheY threw in the life jackets and a hitch and trailer for the skis. This really is the best deal in town and 33 minute drive to the lake. Awesome day on the lake
5	Best of the best. Awesome prices. Great running skis. Super Duper friendly as can be. Very nice, down to earth people. Life jackets, trailer, anchor, ties...everything you need supplied. I'll definitely be back. Maybe rent one of their boats. I can't say enough good things about this company...
5	Friend found this place for our yearly trip to Lake Mead.   We have rented from other local places and these guys are very nice and informal.  No long video to watch and we're not overly suspicious of us.  Skis were in good shape and ran well all weekend. They worked with us on return time.   Easy transaction.  I left $300 which I got back the same 3 hundred bills I left.   Chris and Joe are great and plan on using them on all our future trips.
1	This place was a joke we rented 1 jet ski and brought it back with one scratch. I have been waiting over two weeks for him to tell us how much he's going to charge us why they have held our deposit. Hardly picks up Phone never calls back rarely is there.... Looked at all the good reviews thought it was a good place but I've had the worst experience ever.. By far the worst company I've ever dealt with.. Be careful!
