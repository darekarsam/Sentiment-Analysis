5	Everyone from begging to end we're very professional, friendly, and polite. The room are very clean and sanitary. I had a great experience over all. Will definitely recommend all my friends!
5	LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! I already recommend it to all my friends. Diana is so knowledgeable! Shes very sweet and very honest when she's giving you advice or speaking to you about procedures. Not to mention the machine that she uses is AMAZING! I can barely feel it and I get the best results.
5	My first experience here today. It was so different from American laser. The lady that worked here cared about pain level, coverage, making sure youre satisfied. The machine also didnt shoot cold air at your skin scaring you with every move. She knows what shes talking about and you can see how experienced she is. Comparing to American Laser again, you can feel that shes doing this because she cares about clients vs making $22 an hour to pay bills.
