5	When my Barber for 10 years moved back East, I didn't know where to go.  I must've tried 6-7 barbers, until I finally met Charlie, the owner.  Clean, organized, and very personable.  Always going above and beyond. Now I travel 18 miles from phx, just for the perfect haircut, and personal service.The shop it self is roomy, and perfect for the usual male salon commentary. Usually busy on Fridays and Saturdays, as to be expected, so I try to make it out earlier in the week. I finally found my new place.
5	Before having Charlie as my barber I only really trusted 3 other people cutting my hair. One who doesn't cut anymore and the other two unfortunately are in California. My dilemma was getting as bad as the mop on my head. I met Charlie on a random day hanging out with some friends when he was still cutting in Phoenix who decided to take me on a bad hair day and stuck with him ever since. I'm glad he set up shop here in Chandler because convenience is always great. He always makes me feel welcome, the shop feels like sitting with a bunch of friends in your living room. Charlie is never rushing, if anything he is the complete opposite. He always takes his time and pride in his craft and it shows. Whether from the guy in the seat before you, to the guy stopping by to hang out, all the way till the last person out. I wouldn't trust anyone else!
5	Great customer service Friendly people Always fun Being in this place.. Best barbers in town..
5	We come all the way from San Diego to get the best haircut!  There is no one like Charlie! The atmosphere is so laid back and he is awesome with hard to handle kids who don't stay still for a haircut. BEST barber in the world!
