5	By far one of the best gun stores in Las Vegas!! i've been a customer of Citadel for over 6 years and will conitinue to be for years to come!!!
5	Will return one day. Prices are negotiable especially for those who have served.
2	This place is just plain expensive.  Their ammo is too expensive; I will just go to aimsurplus.com and get a better deal WITH shipping!  Also their silver was way over-priced.  90% junk silver for 28x face value when its true value is less than 25x face value.  Cool store to window shop in, I just wouldn't blow my money there...
5	This place often has some great deals. Most importantly, they have incredible customer service and have helped me numerous times with little thing's absolutely free of charge that other shops would try to nickle and dime you for. Good folks and for that reason I always have them in mind when it comes to gun gear, safes, etc.
1	Citadel "GUN & safe"...... is false advertising....We googled gun stores and this was the first one that came up, so we drove all the way out there assuming they sold guns and to my surprise, they don't sell guns.... just ammo and accessories... Uhm...... what!?!? why the hell isn't it called "Citadel Ammo and accessories" instead!?!? That would've saved us time and a trip.
1	I called this place for an item.  They didn't carry it and told me in a very sarcastic manner, "You wont find that here, not here you wont!"  I wont be back either.  Btw, your prices are to high for ammo and you don't sell guns so why say gun and safe.  It should just say store of misc. goods that people don't want to help sell.
5	This place has been shut down.
1	Bought a safe here from these guys  awhile back and had problems with it recently  .  Called and found out they shut down.  WTF!
