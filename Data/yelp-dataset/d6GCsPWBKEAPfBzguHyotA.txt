4	Usually I'm a bit turned off by dollar stores. Or discount stores for that matter. I find that, many times, such stores lean on the dirty side and the merchandise is craptastic at best. But let me tell you, this Dollar Tree is impressive. Friendly employees, well organized, well lit and chock full of plenty of everyday items priced at $1 each, of course. Are we talking high quality goods here? No. But if you're in need of plastic serving ware, glass vases, giveaways, gift bags, even sunscreen (that works - I've used it), don't overspend! Maybe I'm just used to running to my local pharmacy store to stock up on such goods, but no more. Dollar Tree has got it going on. Just remember though, you sometimes get what you pay for! Set reasonable expectations and spend wisely.
4	I totally agree with Nicole W.  This location is convenient and the story is always stocked full.  The staff are typically very nice and greet me when I arrive, but that was not the case today.  There was only one staff member that I could see and she was busy at the register.  If you walk through each isle, you will definitely find things to make your life easier.  I did a great job today of sticking to what I entered the store to purchase.  I looked for one of my favorite candies, Raisinettes, but that was okay because I didn't need them anyway!Yes, everything is a dollar but there were some candies for $.79 and the greeting cards are 2 for $1.
4	I've been to a couple Dollar Tree stores and what I like about this one is that it's brightly lit with decent windows. That gives it a much better atmosphere for shopping.Shelves are stocked, the folks working are friendly, and everything really is a dollar (except the few things that are two for a dollar).Be warned that even at a buck a pop, there are some things that might be cheaper elsewhere.
