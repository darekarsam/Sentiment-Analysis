5	'Po-ta-toes...boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew' quoth the wise Hobbit Samwise Gamgee, but he forgot probably the best potato of all, the baked. It is a monster spud; when cooked to perfection with crisp skin and stuffed with an amalgam of different fillings, it is a God among veg. The Tattie Shop has perfected the art of baked potatoes; they are without doubt the best in Edinburgh.Tucked into a side street just in Bruntsfield, The Tattie Shop is easily missed but do this at your peril. They have a huge amount of fillings, with the haggis being excellent, as well as the chilli con carne. You can create a tattie with as many fillings in as you like, just don't overdo it or you'll struggle to eat it all, they are remarkably filling. With prices being very reasonable and the owner a good laugh, it is one potato purveyor not to be missed
5	Just like Alex, I've harboured a love of potatoes ever since they were used to unintentionally comic effect during the nine hours of relentless boredom and homo-erotica that was the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Our soil-dwelling friends are regular lunchtime choice for me, and Edinburgh seems to have it's fair share of Baked Potato takeaways and cafes to pick from.The Tattie shop's location a bit out of the way sadly means I rarely get to visit, but I wish I had more opportunities. While I'll stick my neck out and suggests that the taters themselves aren't quite as good as Tempting Tattie in town, the fillings are some way ahead, especially the chilli con carne, a topping oddly absent from the menu at their city centre rival.They don't have the irritating tree-hugger thing going on either, which plagues Cockburn Street's potato outlet. All round it's pretty excellent, and another jewel in the crown of the quite splendid Bruntsfield locality.
