1	not sure if i caught the owner on off day !! when i called to ask about changing my son's game time from 630pm to an earlier time, the owner was not very nice . firstly, he did not identify himself as the owner. he kept telling me that there was no way to make changes. he kept repeating that they have done it this way for 25 years . finally , i asked him who he was & he said he was the owner. strange ? even if it's not possible to change game times, it would be nice to hear that he was "sorry (he) cant do anything." i was very surprised that his customer service skills are so poor. if he treats customers like that , i wonder how he treats his employees or my small children ?????? i will go to every game, since he refused to give us any refund AND i will be sure to tell everyone how he treats his clients ...................   POORLY !!!
5	I absolutely love Breakaway Sports! The staff is exceptional both with instruction and with making the kinds of accommodations that are required with 2 and 5 year olds. I have been bringing my kids to Breakaway for years. Coach Matt is our favorite but the other coaches are fantastic too. I highly recommend it.
4	Nice place for indoor soccer.  The turf seems to be in good shape and the folks at the front desk are nice and helpful.
5	I've been playing for a few sessions now and love it here. I'm on a social league and the refs call the games as such, which is nice to see. They are fair and friendly. Turf is in good shape. Win or lose, my team is known to stay after for some delicious beer and popcorn.
