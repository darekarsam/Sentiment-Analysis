4	Tasty Italian food, small menu but has the essential all prepared nicely.  Owners were very welcoming and the service was good.  I'm just sad they did not have osso bucco the evening I went...
5	Italian in Montreal - a must. La Capannina in Montreal - a must. The service...the food...the ambiance = superb. Came here over the Grand Prix weekend...ordered the Caesar salad to start (the dressing is phenomenal), the escargot (some of the best in Montreal), and has a pasta dish that left my mouth watering. I highly recommend coming here.
