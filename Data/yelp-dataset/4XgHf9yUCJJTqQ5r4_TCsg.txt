4	I was really apprehensive at first to using these type of cleaning services but liferecently has me needing some additional help.The professionalism of the staff isspot on and my house hasn't looked better!!!
5	These guys were awesome. They showed up on time and did a thorough job. Very impressed with their skills - I didnt know my place could be that clean!
4	Pegasus Cleaning is great!  I have a high standard when it comes to clean, and they more than exceeded it.   Prices are more than reasonable for what kind of work you get out of them, and they were right on time.  I would suggest anyone use Pegasus for cleaning needs! Only reason I am giving them a 4 not a 5 is due to a reschedule, they explained the situation and it ended up not being a problem.
1	I would put no stars. Right before my wedding I bought a special online. I pre cleaned for the "crew" and no one showed up. I called the owner and he scrambled to send out someone. The person who came did a terrible job. My husband couldn't tell if anyone showed up until we found a wet mop drying in a guest room. Do not use this company!
