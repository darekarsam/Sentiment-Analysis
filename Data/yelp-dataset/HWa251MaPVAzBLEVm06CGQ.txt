5	This is first and only place I go in Pittsburgh for any sort of technology issue.  Kevin is honest and helpful.  He fixes and repairs all sort of computers and I plan to work with him to purchase my next computer.  I have coming running here with a dead laptop and Kevin has me back and running in under an hour.
5	Kevin's solutions are straightforward, resourceful and often surprisingly inexpensive. He gave me a simple suggestion today for a laptop problem, and it worked. I know with Kevin that his aim is to offer his customers what they need .... whether that be a $5 used mouse or a new computer. My computer and my wallet are in good hands at Kevin's Computer and Photo.
5	I have been using Kevin's for many years to repair our computers.  He has always given me honest advice and saved me money when possible.  He has never let me down.  I highly recommend him.
5	Pittsburgh, PA came to my small office because of having intermittent Internet connection. It was more like 80% down and 20% working. They assessed the problem and determined within 1 hour that the cabling was improperly configured with the router and modem. Very professional and swift. Just felt like a should return the favor by saying a big "Thank you!"
