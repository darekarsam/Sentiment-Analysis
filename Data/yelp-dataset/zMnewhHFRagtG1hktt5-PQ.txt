5	I had an awesome body treatment with Melissa earlier this week. it included a paraffin treatment, facial, salt scrub massage on my arms, legs and hands. When I left my skin was super soft and my face was glowing! The treatment was really relaxing, from the heated bed to the music. I really liked the products she used on my face, too.
5	I had a body treatment here. I LOVED it. I really felt that Melissa took her time and made me feel comfortable. The facility was clean and inviting. Everything that she did was perfect. I could not ask for more! I was very pleased.
5	Not the type of guy that typically gets this type of service but I had been having dry skin issues and my girlfriend highly recommended Melissa at Skintuition.Overall great experience, Melissa explained everything beforehand and ensured that I was comfortable in every way.  The facilities are quite nice and very welcoming.The experience was relaxing, and quite effective.  If nothing else, an important takeaway is that I need to take better care of my skin - from sunscreen to hydration.  Melissa offered some great tips and offers a nice selection of products (and the great thing, no pressure to buy them).This may not be a regular thing for me, but I definitely trust that Melissa knows her stuff, and would definitely use her services again.
