2	Carter's Babies & Kids stores have a huge selection of clothing but a little sparse on the toys and accessories. Came here to purchase gifts for my little niece and nephew and found looking through the clothes a bit overwhelming. They have some really cute stuff but you also have to weed through a lot of terrible styles and poorly illustrated items. Better-designed merchandise is obviously more expensive so you might want to wait until it goes on sale but also taking a chance that it sells out. I found that Carter's is very popular with mom's with small children, at least in my family. I had to return a few items because they were already purchased. That's what happens when you find a nice piece clothing here, there's a good chance that mom already bought it. Also not a big fan of their return policy where they have to get your mailing address. As a person without kids, I really don't wish to receive Carter's junk mail.

Wish their clothes sizes went up a bit higher so I could also shop for my other kids other than that I would recommend shopping here.
