4	Took my car in for an oil change. With a coupon it wasn't bad and they use valvoline so I was happy. They said I needed a new air filter seems I always need one everytime I take my car in. My Dad had just checked it a few weeks ago and said it was fine! Whatever. Then they said I had a tail light out. Yikes! Well it really wasn't a tail light which I can get a ticket for, but the back light on the window. Jeez, I think I will go to autozone and repair it myself. They did quote me with a 45 minute wait and it was right on. Though, I was sitting in the waiting area and they called me on my cell to tell me it was ready, UH hello McFly!!!
4	I stopped in for an oil change after calling ahead to make sure they weren't too busy. I was out within 30 minutes, just as promised. It was a good experience all around -- clean facility, competent service people, very fair price. The only thing I felt might be missing was a waiting room. For sure I'd  go back the next time I need service.
2	They had the cheapest tires around, but I won't go here for ANYTHING else. They didn't call me when my tires came in, wouldn't set an appointment or return my calls forcing me to repeatedly call them, they were pushy and rude about things I didn't need, told them I didn't want, and flat out refused to pay for. Next time I'll just buy the tires and get them installed somewhere else, "free" installation or not.  The only reason this is getting two stars instead of one is that the very last time I came in, the people working were polite, quoted me a time and stuck to it, and didn't lie to my face about work my car "needed".
