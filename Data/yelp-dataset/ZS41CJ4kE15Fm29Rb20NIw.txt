4	Finally! A dollar store that fits the bill! This shop is nice and clean. Tidy. No mess. Great product assortment and variety of goods too. Had everything in stock that I was looking for. I really like the wide aisles to maneuver your shopping cart. Clerks were available and ready to help too. Oh, and my wait in line was just a few seconds. High five to this Dollar Tree store.. Keep it up!!
4	I love this location.This dollar tree is always clean and typically has everything Wal-Mart has for cheaper. It is always stocked and if not the workers are so gracious to check in the back. I kobqe coming in because not matter what the worker is doing they greet and ask if need any help. The floors are clean and even though topically it isn't busy the staff helps and communicates well.
