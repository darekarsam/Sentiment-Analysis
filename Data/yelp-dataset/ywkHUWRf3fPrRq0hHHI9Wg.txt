2	My son goes to Karate right next door. It has been convenient stopping off at this pack and ship place to send things off....unitl last month when I had a prepaid Century Link box ready to be shipped. All I needed was a piece of tape. I didn't see any there for it's customers like FedEx and UPS has. So I set it down on the counter and asked her for a small piece of packing tape (literally 2x"2"). She said "Yes, for 25 cents." Okay, this might sound snobby, but I truly thought she was joking. I said " Really?" and I smiled. She said "Yes, 25 cents." I replied "Oh wow, you are serious. 25 cents?" She said "You have to pay for something. So you can pay for the tape." I gave her the quarter, but she lost my business. I litereally drive an extra 3 miles to ship my things now. I want to help this business out, but I don't want to be forced to pay for tape just because the shipment was prepaid. That was not cool.

5	The owner always takes her time to help save you money on shipping cost. She has anything from shipping to gifts items and is very personal and friendly.
1	Zero stars.  Came in to send out some flat rate boxes.  Lady gave me a used box and wouldn't give me a new box that she gets from USPS for free so that I could send my items safely!  She was very rude to me when I told her I was not comfortable using a box that had been used already.  Won't be returning EVER.  Very poor service.
