5	Janet is a fantastic and patient instructor!  She is so knowledgeable and really remembers what it is like to be a first time horseback rider.  She always created fun and challenging lessons for me and was quick with encouraging compliments and great suggestions.  No need to be intimidated at her place- very warm and friendly environment with great horses!  I can't wait to get my kids a training package next!
5	Janet is a great riding instructor.  She expects her students to make real progress and is able to meet varying needs (speed events for my daughter and basic trail for me).  Her barn is kept in impeccable order and the horses receive great care.  I highly recommend Janet as a riding instructor.
5	My niece,Cindy, recently took some lessons from Janet and here are her thoughts: Janet is a great instructor. She modifies the lessons to your level of experience.  I enjoyed the lessons I took with her and love her horses.
