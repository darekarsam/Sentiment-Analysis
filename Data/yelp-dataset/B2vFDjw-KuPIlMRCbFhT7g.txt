4	A really friendly and knowledgeable staff.  A good inventory of fascinating books (I think everyone could find at least one book they want to leave the store with).  There could be a few more helpful signs for help in locating the various sections of the store, but it is also fun to just browse.  It's nice to have an independent bookstore downtown with a welcoming store and good inventory.  Very cool that they are open on Sundays.
5	This place is really neat.  Nice selection of books.  Eric, the owner, is very accommodating and helpful.  He offers great deals and has even given me a free beverage while I browse.
5	Fantastic used book shop. If you love purusing, a tiny paradise amidst downtown. Very kind customer service as well!
5	This is a great local used book store. I was pleasantly surprised to find both of the books I was looking for, and I saved a good amount of money over buying the books new, and they were still in very good condition. Friendly staff as well.
5	I happened upon this store today and I'm glad I did. Found a unique and interesting art book (which is what I always look for), and the owner is friendly and helpful. May we always have cool bookstores around! (A side note: I signed up for an email receipt, and the company who processes these asked for feedback on the store by clicking on a smiley or frowny face. As silly as that is, I didn't realize I'd clicked on the wrong one until too late, and it can't be changed, which is lame! So I wanted to be sure I shared my true opinion here.)
