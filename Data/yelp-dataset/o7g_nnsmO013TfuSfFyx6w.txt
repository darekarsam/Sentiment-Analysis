1	If i could leave less than 1 star i would. Horrible.., Horrible!! Order making. 3 times in a row that they repeat the order correctly but cannot make it right. Missing items, raw egg yolk in breakfast jack. Large fries that have small portions. Please avoid this location. They will fail you. Its comical at this point. I gave up.
1	This is by far this WORST jack in the box location I have EVER been too! Horrible! Their curly fries are ALWAYS soggy and cold. Their hamburgers are cold and seems to be undercooked. I could go on and on about how crappy this location is but hopefully you get the point. DO NOT GO HERE!
