1	The absolute worst Steinberg I've been to yet!! And that's saying something. Staff is difficult and rude!! First and last visit to this location.
1	I absolutely agree!!!! This staff need to be trained in compassion and customer service. This location needs a total overhaul  of its staff!!!!!!! THE WORST!!!!!!
3	No issues here - I was in and out in an hour for an MRI. The staff was friendly and efficient. Only disappointment was that I didn't get to choose the radio station while in the machine.
2	The staff is friendly and efficient, and for that I gave a star. I cannot award a higher rating because I find it extremely degrading that ultrasound patients have to disrobe and wait in a waiting area in hospital gowns, rather than just change in the ultrasound room. Having a pelvic ultrasound is already unnerving and embarrassing. I would gladly give a higher star rating if I was allowed to keep a shred of dignity. As I mentioned, the staff is excellent, it's this changing policy that needs to go.
5	This location was amazing. The staff was kind and professional. I was seen in a timely matter and the ultrasound technician was very kind and compassionate. I took my 3 week old baby for an ultrasound and they were very understanding of the baby's needs when it came to feeding and getting me in quick. The front office girl, which I did not catch her name, was awesome! Will definitely go back to this location.
