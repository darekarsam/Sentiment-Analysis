1	The foods are so bad!! I can't believe it! That's why the price is way too cheap! Not worth eating here honestly. If you like it, it's just that you have a bad taste
4	Food is good enough but amazing..no. It's fast it's cheap and it's tasty enough. Value for the money? Definitely
4	This was one of those Yelp wins that makes me so delighted to be adventuring armed with an app amplified by such an amazing community. We were at the St Michel Market, which at a certain point becomes overwhelming, and we headed out into the rain with our wares when hunger hit and seconds before tripping weakly towards the metro I pulled out my trusty Yelp App, hit that Nearby tab and TADAM. Deliciousness right across the street apparently. We opened the door and grinned at each other. A big comfortable room, full but with seats for us, and packed with families almost entirely Asian eating grilled lobster, whole roast fishes, glorious noodle mountains. Friendly happy service greeted and seated us and handed over big fat menus written in at least 4 languages in some parts, with Vietnamese, Cambodian, Thai and Chinese classics. We were only too people so we could only try so much, and neither of us are experts but the spicy Cambodian beef was just perfect in texture, and uniquely spicy and sweet and awesome. The Kim Hour noodles were just right too, not too greasy, but just greasy enough, and the veggies we ordered were tasty and tart too. Inexpensive, and an excellent compliment to any St Michel adventure. Thanks wholeheartedly fellow Yelpers!
3	Bro listen up, the food was mad decent. You have to get up for the bill but coug when you fine dine like this you need a bit of exercise. There is a great mix of spices in the dishes and a lot of choices on the menu. I defz recommend this restaurant to anyone who is on the look out for good Oriental food.
