5	Wow! Amazing restaurant on Nun's Island and fast becoming a favorite go to! They are child friendly and provide good service. The sushi is good and there is a good selection between hot and cold dishes. Try it out! You won't be disappointed.

5	I went to the Sushi Palace in Verdun recently and I was extremely satisfied. I am a huge fan of the Saint-Laurent location, but I think this one may even be better!The sushi was delicious and the fish tasted very fresh. The deep fried dishes were all very well fried; crispy and not too oily. The beef sashimi: awesome!The service was top-notch. The staff was all very friendly and polite. We never ran out of water. I will go back for more, even if its farther than the Saint-Laurent location.
5	Great sushi, service and great value for what you get. There is reduced pricing for children which is a big plus. The decor is great and they offer a varied menu for an a you can eat place. I prefer this place over Kanda since the fish is very fresh and the portions are ample. It gets really packed at lunch so head early. :-D
