1	Lame company. Lengthy windows. Who really has time to stay home from 8am to 2pm waiting for them. Plus, they were super late past that six hour waiting period. Crappy service as well. Don't recommend. Secretary is rude, also. Never again.
5	Considering that I have 4 kids and a dog these carpets were disgusting. I don't remember there names but they were very professional. My complex have us a carpet cleaning for a renewal of our lease. Yes the window for arrival was long but what do people expect when they are working on other jobs also..unrealistic. these guys had great customer service they came in and got right to work.
5	I have two young boys and my carpets looked HORRIBLE!!!!! Rite-Way came in  and made them look brand new, they looked better than when i first moved in. The guys that came to do them were super nice! When i called to set up the appointment the receptionist was so nice and she really worked with my crazy schedule. I would definitely recommend to anyone that needs their carpets cleaned and their prices are the best out there! Believe me im a bargain queen and i shopped around for like 2 weeks and no one can beat these prices!!!
