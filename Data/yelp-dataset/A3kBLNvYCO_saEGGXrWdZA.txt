4	First, the only complaint our table had was that the waitress brought us an extra tea cup and she reached over the food of us.  It would have been preferred that she went around to the guy who asked for the tea cup. Other than that, this would be considered one of the best Chinese places in Henderson to me.  They are open until 9.  I got the pork fried rice and it was only 5.50, it does come with bean sprouts and onions so if you don't like that just say none please.  There was enough left over for lunch the next day.  They have tons of different dinner specials that were no more than 10 bucks a plate, and it came with the main entree, tea, soup, rice and egg roll.  That was tons of food.  My table had the garlic beef, egg foo young, sweet & sour chicken and ribs. Everyone enjoyed the food and said it was much better than the strip mall chinese food.
