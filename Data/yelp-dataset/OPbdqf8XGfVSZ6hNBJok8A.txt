1	Consistently mediocre, stale, cold coffee paired with inconvenient parking and topped with passive, unenthusiastic Baristas more concerned with chit chat than creating "the Third Place" they are trained to.
1	Dirtiest/messier starbucks I have ever been in. Mop sitting out with empty garbage bag by cream/milk station, floor filthy, empty display sitting in middle of area.  Watched guy make my iced tea lemonade in dirty shaker and lid--I could see the old tea sitting in in shaker and lid before he picked it up.  Cups was upright instead of upside down to drain on the mat.  Manager screamed from lobby to cashier that she had a customer.  Ice refill bucket that had been on floor in back was set on counter. GROSS!!!!
