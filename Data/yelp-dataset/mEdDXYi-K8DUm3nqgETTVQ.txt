3	A nice little location hidden in between apartments and some local businesses. The coffee here is pretty darn good and there a few treats too. I like that it never seems busy so no waiting around - dash in - dash out!
4	Its EVP, so you know the coffee is going to be great. I've only tried one of their soups, and it was full of undercooked vegetables and it was somehow greasy and watery besides being under seasoned. So I can't really recommend them for lunch based on that.I would give them a 5 stars for coffee, 4 stars for ambiance, and 2 stars for food. The service has always been friendly if somewhat disorganized.It's kind of a peaceful oasis near an open green space, which is nice to escape to on my work break.
5	The newest location of Madison's favorite Coffee Shop, EVP. Same great coffee - growing vibe as this location gains momentum. It's on University Row at University Ave just West of Whitney Way. All of their coffee is air roasted at their East Washington Ave location. This is where they make their soups and baked goods. If you are visiting Madison, check out the local joints like EVP!
