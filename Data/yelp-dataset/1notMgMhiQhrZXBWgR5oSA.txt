3	Casual bar.  You usually get two free drinks if you stay at The Excalibur. This is a good place to use the coupons and to hang for a bit. Jim, the bartender, has been there for a while, and provides great service.
1	Three of us approached the bar wanting to order drinks (go figure, right?). After looking at the specialty cocktail menu, the first person in my party orders a "Le Melon Mule"-- a spin on the Moscow Mule. The bartender hears the order and loudly exclaims, "Ah shit!" We ask what's wrong, and he just sighs and says, "Nothing," and goes about halfheartedly making the drink with mostly wrong ingredients. I order an Old Fashioned, and the bartender starts arguing with me, sighing first and then saying, "You sure? You're too young for that shit." He then takes out a double shot glass, pours in Jack Daniels, ice, and club soda, and calls it a day. Not an Old Fashioned. Clearly this guy hates his job-- probably because he's terrible at it-- which is cool, because clearly his tip was commensurate with the customer service he provided.
1	Don't order anything but beer--otherwise you'll be cursed at, chastised for your choices, and given awful and lazy renditions of their specialty drinks. An Old fashioned is not jack and water...
