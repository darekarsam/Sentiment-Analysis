4	Stopped in to check it out.This church is truly beautiful!  We entered and wandered around, taking in the simplicity of it, which made it even nicer.If you love viewing European churches, then make this a stop on your meanderings.There are no tours and as such, no fees.  There are brochures in multiple languages to explain the history of the church.
