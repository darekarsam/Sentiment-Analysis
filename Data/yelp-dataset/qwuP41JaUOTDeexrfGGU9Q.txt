2	Employees are not friendly - food is the same as any other Subway... nothing special.
2	The customer service here is awful, very unfriendly employees.  They are also not very generous with the serving size of certain subs (Steak, Chicken teriyaki etc.).  Other than that the food is identical to any other Subway, but I try to go to the Subway on Waterloo Campus over this one whenever possible.
1	Pretty rude service, employees act like they don't wanna be there. Location wise nice store and food quality like any other subway
