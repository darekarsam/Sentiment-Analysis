5	I always use Suburban Elite Transport services whenever I am traveling to and from the airport.  They are always on time if not early, and get me there faster than other transportation service.  I recently used Suburban Elite Transport for my company holiday party and my co-workers loved our drivers spontaneous attitude, great conversation always helps end the night on a good note.
5	I have had to hire transportation for my clients for business to and from the airport along with own personal needs and I have never had a more professional company. They were on time, respectful and very fair with their prices. I highly recommend them.
5	A great service was provided and they were on time at every drop off and pick up very reasonable prices and the drivers knew quick routes to get us to our destination! I highly recommend this company and you won't be disappointed! Definitely a must have there number in your phone for emergency!!!
5	This service is 2nd to none! Not only are the drivers personable and friendly, but they make you feel very comfortable, they definitely know their way around the city, and always show up on time!! What more could you ask for!!! 5 star service for sure.."
5	This past fall I flew into Phoenix for a short weekend with some friends.  I found Suburban Elite Transport online and had them pick us up at the airport and take us to our hotel.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they were not only an airport shuttle service, but they were also available to take us anywhere we needed.  They took us out for a great night on the town and knew the best places to go and even knew some of the door men and got us in some clubs with no problems.  They were also able to get us to a golf course with all of our clubs and everyone in the same vehicle.  That was definitely worth it.  The prices are very reasonable for the service you get.  Will make sure to use them whenever I am back in Phoenix.
