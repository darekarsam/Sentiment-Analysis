4	Nice selection of craft beers (eventough that all of those listed on the menu aren't available yet; they do have to build up their inventory), warm atmosphere (all floors and tables made of genuine wood), food is excellent even though the portions could be a bit bigger. I took the "flanc de porc" with the corn/shrimp salsa. The salsa was incredible and perfectly spicy to my own taste (used to think that in Montreal, anything categorized  as spicy isn't spicy enough.... can't help it, local people are just not used to spicy things). The flanc de porc was crispy, tasty and well cooked. MIAM!Service was very good. The waiter wasn't always pushing us to have more beer and the food has been served in about 15 minutes. Just enough to enjoy your first pint.The second floor is interesting. There are nice spots to either invite a date or for a small business meetingSo, in a nutshell, a food  pub that worth the detour. Now, let's see how they will evolve over time! Will they keep their promises?
