5	A before our wedding, the DJ we had cancelled on us! We were freaking out to say the least. It got worse when our second cancelled as well. I guess he double booked and we were cut loose. I wanted to give up and just play an iPod. But luckily, I was referred to Birkett Entertainment. Our DJ was Tony and to say he was perfect was an understatement. He reassured me that he would be there on my special day no matter what! He was so detailed and really got to know what my husband and I wanted. I had many guests tell me there was not one song they didn't like on the play list. I would recommend tony to anyone! I can't thank him enough for all he did.
5	Birkett Entertainment is truly phenomenal! Chris goes above and beyond what you can imagine. His attention to detail, creative innovations to make any event special, and memorable is a work of art. He touches the lives of so many people. I would highly recommend working with his company for all your DJ, and entertainment needs. His company is the best! In addition to his business, he puts on the most phenomenal Halloween extravaganza, and magical," winter wonderland ". Incredible!Cliff Gaines-A 1 Studios
1	I had used Birkett Entertainment upon a recommendation from a good friend.  I held a non-profit gala at the Phoenix Convention Center and was surprised at how rude the office manager Denise was.  I was accused of asking too many questions - worse than a bride.  Questions like, what time is the DJ going to be there, Can the DJ talk to the Convention Center folks as they needed to ensure they had his needs met.  You see, the first DJ quit after I had many details settled, then trying to re-establish the details with the new D, it was met by Denise ultimately telling me never to use them again.  Although the new DJ showed up late and delayed the start, he was courteous and responded to my requests.   To all my friends and connections.  Never use these folks.
