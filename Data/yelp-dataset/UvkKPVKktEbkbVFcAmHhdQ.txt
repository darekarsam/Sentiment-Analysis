4	This little shop is one of the best secrets in the Southside neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The collection of specially crafted clothing and accessories at the front tells a well-edited story of crafty, flirty, fun existence. Some of their stuff is modern & hip, but there are stand-out classics on the racks, too. The hair salon in the back is an even bigger secret. I honestly don't know if they ever accept new clients without a recommendation or two, but if you can get in, it is worth it. Creative and inspired, the cuts and dyes I have seen come out of that back room are mind boggling! Do you want to look like a gorgeous, pulled-together hockey mom? No problem. Would you rather have bleached white hair with hot pink and teal peacock designs dyed in? No problem. It feels like an intimate slumber party with girls you wish were your friends, but afterwards, your hair is "better-then-bedhead"-licious.
