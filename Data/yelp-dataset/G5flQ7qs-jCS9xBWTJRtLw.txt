5	FIVE stars for carrying New Mexico Hatch chile!!!!! e.o.m.
4	always nice and clean..kind of a long line for menudo but the live mariachi made the time pass quickly
4	came to visit a good family friend who we call uncle brought us here.  we happened to come in on a Sunday.  this is your local locals supermarket.  so inside this supermarket their is a little food area.  where you can order food and sit down and relax... who wouldnt want to do that while shopping?!On Sundays they have a live mariachi band playing.  four talented guys who have great tunes. while walking around i saw the prices of the produce here are really cheap.. especially compared to NY prices.  for example avocados in NY 1 avocado can range from $0.99 to $1.29 each.  Here at Food City avocados $0.99 for 3 avocados!!!next time i return its to come back and here more mariachi music! well done!
3	Last minute shopping for Mexican themed holiday dinner. Found everything I was looking for but really nothing on sale as you might expect. Was able to put all items in the small fold out compartment near the grocery cart handle cost $40! Pork shoulder was $3.19 lb. / $2.99 lb. for bone in. Check out was fast and parking wasn't bad either. Just get $50 worth of $.99 tacos from Taco Bell or Jack in the Box and save yourself the trouble. Enjoy ha ha
