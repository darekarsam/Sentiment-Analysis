1	Against my better judgement, I stopped here to get a snack on the way home Friday.  The whole point of me stopping here was to be in and out quickly and this experience was anything but.I could see they were busy since the drive-thru had wrapped around the building once so I decided to park and go inside to save me some minutes and some screaming and yelling in my personal vehicle.... I ordered a regular value meal thinking it would be faster, but it took a really long time for it to come out.  I'm trying to be objective and not exaggerate, but if I wanted to go to a sit-down restaurant I think the food would have come out faster than this taco bell.  Not only that, but it seems like the people in front of me waited forever as well - it was a group of friends and one of them had already finished eating and his friends were still waiting on their food.Overall, bad experience - could have been a bad night, but I don't think I will be visiting this location any time again.
1	I never review franchises unless the are bad. This taco bell is terrible. If I want taco bell I go further and more out of the way to get it. Service is terrible, they are always messing up an order and the drive through is always backed up. Several different people have worked here and they continue to be rude, and could care less about their work ethic. Avoid this place
1	If it was possible to give this establishment zero stars that is the rating I would give it. I live right near here so if I want Taco Bell this is regrettably the one easiest to go to, and every time I give them a chance they never fail to disappoint. They consistently A. Don't get my order right or B. Give me the wrong food or forget an item I paid for entirely. I would never recommend going here unless they're giving you free food and even then I would think twice about it.
