3	Post Gateway is a pretty cool apartment complex. If you are into the whole college feel, this is totally the place you'd want to be. Be leary of the apartments you may be shown that are right next to the train tracks, especially if you are a light sleeper. The units are nice and well kept. The negative for me was that it felt like a college campus, and I was looking for a more quiet type of place.
3	We live at Post Gateway, and it's worked out really well for us so far. I don't really agree that it feels like a college campus. I guess the building is somewhat dorm-like, but it's not a real communal place. At least not fur us; we rarely see our neighbors outside of the parking deck. Which is fine. On warm weekend days, there can be a somewhat fratty scene at the pool, which is commonplace in Charlotte. Loud music, beer, generally partying are big on weekends at complex's pools. Generally, the management has been reliable; lights are fixed, plumbing issues are dealt with quickly, and they're really on top of their communication. Sometimes on the weekends parties will go late in other apartments, which is annoying from a noise perspective, but people are pretty respectful of neighbors. My biggest complaint is that the hallways are pretty drab (like a back stairwell), but the units themselves are really nice. I love the location, too--right near downtown but not really in the mess of it.
2	As for the property its ok, but the biggest problem is the way members of the staff handle residents. Be prepared to be told one thing and then they do another. Watch out!
