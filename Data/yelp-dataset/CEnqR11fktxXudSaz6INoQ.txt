1	The worst customer service I have received in at least twenty years. They ignored customers, acted like they were doing us a favor by pointing to where product was available and seemed like workers out of some movie about Russian bureaucracy  . I would drive 20 miles to go to another location if I wanted to use U Haul again.
4	I hate driving a uhaul so much until today I was able to avoid it.  The staff here was great!  Friendly, helpful and attentive.  The uhaul was in great shape for a uhaul which is pretty much the scariest thing to drive EVER IMO (at least with a normal license). They also full propane which is also a plus, def would recommend again to anyone looking to move their own junk :)
1	This was the worst truck rental experience I have ever had!   The truck broke down within 10 min of leaving the rental store.  They had roadside assistance come and I was told to wait while they tried to fix the truck for me, so that could use it again.  The truck ended up being towed.  I was never offered a replacement.  I had to be taken back to the store by the people that towed me and when I arrived an hour and a half later they asked me to pay for the time I had the truck.    When I explained, again, that the truck broke down and was towed.   They proceeded to ask for money for the gas.    The manager was as  equally as rude as his employees.  I have never experienced such levels of poor customer service and will never rent from here again.
