3	The stereotypical greasy spoon cafe and by saying this I mean it as a great compliment.Please do not expect silver service when visiting the Roseburn Caf, nor fluffy cakes and dainty French pastries.However please do expect a tasty home style fry-up, tea, coffee and friendly folk happy to put more rather than less on your plate.A great place to come the morning after with your newspaper and headache in tow...and bring your appetite!
