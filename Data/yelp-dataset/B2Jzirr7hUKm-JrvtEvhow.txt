4	Today Nails is a great place for a pedicure.  Fast service, nice staff, great massage chairs and a glass of wine to get you relaxed! Clean, safe, great work, reasonably priced.  I've recommended this salon to quite a few friends and all have been satisfied.
4	This salon is always my go to salon. It's on my route home and once they start on your nails service is fast. The last few times I've gone there has been a bit of a wait, but if you have an appointment it's smooth sailing. I love the staff here and the owner and her daughter are very personable.
5	So far this is the best salon that I have been to in a while. Everyone there was super nice and actually engaged in conversation with you. They are also well priced I got a fill in and my nails cut down(which is normally extra at the salons I've been to) for $16. I've paid up to $25 for a sucky full in before but this one is great. Think I just found my new salon :)
5	I flew into town today and just picked this place as it was close and had 3 good reviews. (Most people will review when they are unhappy so I figured it was a safe bet.)  The owner was very nice and found the polish to match the gel of "I am not just a waitress."  Salina did my gel mani and my pedi and did a great job. She was very funny and I enjoyed the conversation and her attention to detail. Will come back again next time I am in town. Btw everything is very clean and everyone there was friendly.
