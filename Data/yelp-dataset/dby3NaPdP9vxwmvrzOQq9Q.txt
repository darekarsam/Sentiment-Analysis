5	Right so it's Janet and not Joanne and since first going they've added a nail bar. The staff here are just lovely. Still loving my bouncy blowdrys after a cut. I also like that Janet really listens you and advises you well. Most hairdressers do what you say even though it's stupid, hence the 2006 cut from very long to a very short cut. Great at the time but regretted it within a week. I spoke to Janet on the phone to rearrange an appointment I made for a restyle online, told her not to let me cut it and today she subtlety told me she wasn't taking more than a trim off. Phew.They've started a loyalty card and they also have a beauty room with HD brows. That tempts me but would they end up Desperate Scousewives or 40s moviestar? Suppose it depends on your makeup and clothes. If I'm brave enough to try it I'll let you guys know.
