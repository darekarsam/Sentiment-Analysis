4	Drive thru window staff was very friendly and professional.
1	This place is like a zoo just run by animals literally I stayed waiting in line for 10 minutes and there was a couple a head of me waiting there for an extra 5 minutes and I said you know what I'm out of here I'm going to Carls Jr.
2	Can't screw up the food as I got a basic hamburger. The service though sucks big time here.. If you go thru drive thru expect a 10 minute wait minimum. If it's busy it will be longer
1	My chicken was undercooked and was onion filled in my chicken fajita pita made me not to ever get one again thanks a lot
1	It's my fault. I knew going to jack in the box after midnight meant the milkshake machine would be cleaning and the made to order burgers would be warmed up and made to be reheated. My ultimate cheeseburger had fresh sauce but it was not able to cover the old burger patty lukewarm taste.
