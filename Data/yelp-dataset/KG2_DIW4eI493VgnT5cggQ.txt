5	I started going here when I purchased a Living Social for some oil changes, but will now  be a lifetime customer.  Their customer service is amazing and they are incredibly reasonable on price.  Great place.
5	Went for a basic oil change and was out within half an hour!  The service was very friendly,  I plan on going back.
1	Stay away from this AAMCO! They have the worst customer service EVER! We purchased a Groupon to have our tires rotated and a fuel injection service performed, made an appointment and showed up 10 minutes early only to be informed that they were an hour behind. I even called before I went there to see if maybe there was a cancellation so maybe I cold get in and out earlier. The person who answered the phone, Tasha, didn't say anything about them being behind. Had she said so, I would have waited 45 minutes before going there. Turns out I sat there for almost 3 hours! NOT GOOD! Then when it was time for me to check out, she tried to charge me $3.52  for 'shop materials'. Well, I happen to have worked in a shop and a couple of shop towels doesn't cost $3.52. So I picked up my car keys and left. Next I will be contacting Groupon about this shady business.
