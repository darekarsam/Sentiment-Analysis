5	I had a leak in my rack and pinion. They took me out to the shop and showed me the problem, explained everything to me and made suggestions on getting it repaired. Kevin was very professional and saved me a little more money than the original quote. They have a large sign displayed over their counter stating they will never charge you for parts or service you don't need.  I am a single women and always a bit leery about if I am being taken advantage of in these situations but I felt very comfortable with their honesty and service. They also gave me a ride home and back when service was completed.
4	Sadly I had to use their service recently,Was involved in an accident and my insurance recommended this establishment. From coming to tow my truck, keeping me updated, to allowing me to drop off my rental at their location. Everything was very smooth, very nice customer service. The only issue I had was when my truck was repaired, I noticed the steering slightly sticking. Automotive agreed and called my insurance about it. However, my insurance had their own opinion. The only reason why I could not give them a five-star review was, they should have noticed the steering sticking when the truck was at their facility. But other wise, it was a easy and great experience.
