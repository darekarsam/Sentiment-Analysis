3	I must say I was not impressed by the food here or anywhere we ate in the Montreal area. I would have checked on yelp but my Verizon HTC thunderbolt essentially became a brick once I crossed the canadian border. we tried some of the tapas and I had one beer. They were alright, but nothing to write home about. I have tasted better and more imaginative food elsewhere and paid far less. There was a banner on the restaurant that said they had two other location, New York and Miami. I think that is what drew me in. Unfortunately, it was not great. I would give it 2 1/2 stars if i could.
