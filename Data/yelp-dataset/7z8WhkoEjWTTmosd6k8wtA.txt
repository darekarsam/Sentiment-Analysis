1	Staff  won't respond after 5 emails for the over charging by the Vue for so called damages once the student has moved out. Staff  promised to send  all bills paid to there vendors for repair work and the break down between the six students living in the apartment and pictures of all damage. Parents be a ware of the Vues billing practicesThey even state they will attach your students or your credit but will not provide the proof requested. I would not let my student stay there again.
1	The Vue has changed management companies,now a new statement dated the same date as old statement with a new dollar amount and aditional charges,and more excuses. Parents,Parents!!! Please beware of the Vue and there billing practices.
1	I live at the vue now and management is HORRIBLE. the pool is always closed and I've only been to it once. A couple examples, I tried going to the pool to cook burgers at the grill but it was closed. Last Sunday, I went to the pool to cook salmon and the pool was closed. Twice now I've had to walk to the other apartments down the street just to grill. The weight room's lowest dumbbell weight is 75pounds. I'm a 115 pound female who pays $720 a month plus $80 parking and I'm not able to use any of the amenities that the vue (922 Place) "offers". Like I said, management is horrible, they never respond to emails, the staff is lazy and the office is disorganized. They've misplaced my mail and took them two days to find it again. That envelope contained over $1,000. Thanks for being so careless. DO NOT LIVE HERE.
