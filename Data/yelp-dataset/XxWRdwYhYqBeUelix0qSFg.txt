4	This Barnes and Noble is huge, and it is in such a great location: right in the Waterworks Mall!  Anytime I am trying to make it through the long wait of Burgatory, I find myself going to B&N to spend my time.  They have games, books, music, and all sorts of fun stuff to keep you occupied.  They also have an awesome cookbook section in the back of the store.  It is a food lovers paradise.
5	Staff is really friendly.  They will look up books for you and do a lot to make sure you have a good experience. They also have a really nice inventory.  I am always impressed when I come here. There is also a cafe with free AT&T Wi-Fi so you can bring your laptop to the cafe if you want.
4	I usually just go here for the cafe.  And that is always a good experience!  Super friendly team members and a great selection.  I only gave it four out of five stars because it is a little on the pricey side.
5	I wish more people shopped at book stores as they are all slowly going out of business. This one was nice as all of the Barnes and Nobles I have been at are. The coffee was good if you get one. Nice bright store with a great selection of books and gift ideas. Friendly helpful staff.  Nice place to kill time.
