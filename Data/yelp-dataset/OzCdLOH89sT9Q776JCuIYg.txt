4	Great location.  I like that it's carpeted.
4	This CVS is conveniently located on the corner, so it's great for any forgotten items you need to get on the way home. They sell liquor, have a prescription drive thru, and are open 24 hours!
4	I love this CVS. I get all my Rx's here (unless their out of my meds) and shop here quite often especially for the coupon sales items.  The store is always nice and clean. The people who work there are very friendly and helpful. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because they have one cashier who is extremely irritating. He is extremely slow and makes transactions difficult especially if you have a return (even with the receipt). I try to go to another cashier but they usually only have one line open.
1	I have transferred my husbands prescription to this location almost half a dozen times and they still can't find it everytime I need to refill the prescription. Pharmacy reps are rude, refuse to call the doctors office to verify prescription and they just can't do anything because their system doesn't talk to each other. And when all else fails they put you in an extended hold. Lisa, the manager is even worst. She contradicted everything the tech said and claimed they can't see anything about the prescription. It's a shame because they are the only 24 hour cvs in the area and I only use cvs because they are covered by my insurance. I'm giving them 1 star because it's the lowest rating. I have been on hold for 32 minutes and I'm still on hold. They are a disgrace to the medical field.
