4	When I say this is a European market I mean eastern Europe.  There is tons of stuff here from places like Russia, Ukraine, and many other countries.  It is a really fun place to explore and see what all they have.  A lot of cookies and crackers I noticed, but hey I'm not complaining.  There is also a deli and bakery section if you want to get something fresh made.  I haven't had a chance to get something from the deli yet, but I want to because everything looked very good
5	Excellent Russian store
1	Moldy Cakes and old meat. I bought a big slice of honey cake for my niece, and when we took a bite, immediately the rancid mold flavor was unmistakable. We both felt sick the rest of the night. I inspected the cake closely to find quite a few mold spots in its layers. When we took it back, the lady basically said "not my problem" and didn't even offer one apology. My advice is shop here if you don't mind risking your items potentially being old and expired.
4	Good selection. I loved the sausages they have there. Also I loved the fish selection. The Ukrainian pelmeni they have are very tasty.HOWEVER, it is very expensive. One jar of pickled tomatoes  is $9. I think it should be 5-6.
