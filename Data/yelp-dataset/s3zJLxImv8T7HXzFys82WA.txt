4	A great stop for a quick sandwich at lunch (fresh veggies, meats, and bread), or for a sweet treat - their Millefeuille is lovely as are the chocolatines. Always friendly service and great location near Parc Lafontaine on the bike paths.
4	I am sad that this excellent bakery only has two reviews! The assortment of pastries and breads is very fine, and overall Mr. Pinchot should be considered one of the best boulangeries in the city. It is hard not to want one of everything when you stop by.
5	Visited in 2013. I recently had an amazing memory of Pinchot.  I just had to add a review. Absolutely loved this neigborhood bakery.  Superb bread!  Happened to pass by this bakery on my way to the park (Parc Fontaine).  I stopped in and was moved by the aroma and quaint environment.  The attendant was so very pleasant and helpful.  They made me a sandwhich with a bread of my choice and I took that for an afternoon at Parc del Fontaine.  It was a spiritual experience.
