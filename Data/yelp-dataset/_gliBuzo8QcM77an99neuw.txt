5	Antonio did a fantastic job detailing my car. He was extremely responsive via phone and text message. I purchased a LivingSocial voucher for auto detailing and they came within a week to my home in Henderson. They have a pickup truck with an attached carriage full of equipment including an industrial vacuum. The car looked amazing afterward, and it was a great value. They also make sure to do a good job -- the first time they came the trunk wasn't vacuumed and after I contacted them, they came back out to my house on the day after Christmas and vacuumed it! Thanks so so much for helping me find my go-to auto detailing provider in the Las Vegas Valley!
5	I was so satisfied with their work . Not only was my car the shiniest I ever seen but they have great service overall . Love them they will be my go to detailers for as long as they want .
1	What a waste of money! For a $200 detail I got a simple car wash and wax.  And then it rains 48 hrs later and they tell me they only warranty the wash for 24 hrs. The guy that jipped me on the wash was named Antonio. So for everybody else watch the integrity of their details it's a joke!
