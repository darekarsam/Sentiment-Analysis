4	This is a wonderful little coffeeshop situated in an old house in Fort Mill, right off the main drag.  They have loads of different choices coffee wise, as well as numerous teas, chai tea and italian sodas.  The desserts are delicious & the owners are more than willing to customize anything you ask them to. They left the rooms of the house pretty much as-is so it's not all wide open.   A great place to get together with friends or sit in a cozy chair & read a book.  I was there during the dead of Winter, but the front porch is probably really great in the Spring & Summer!  They also have wi-fi.
1	GONE!No longer in this cute House - In its place, a new Business: Savannah's : Dining, Bakery & Catering.
1	We are new to the Charlotte, NC area and when I looked up for things to do I found information about what sounded like a cool event for a Fri night at a coffee shop.  It clearly listed 7pm on Fri night the 20th at 124 Confederate in Fort Mill.  So we head over there only to find a cute little house with no customers and a bakery business named Savanah's which is only open a few hours during the day.  Unfortunately, Bacintyme was no where to be found and so we asked around at the local shops on Main street and none of them knew about it as well.  Also, stopped in at a gas station and again, no one knows about this Bacintyme Coffee Cafe!  I guess Bacintyme is really back  in time and no longer exists...  Too bad because we were looking for a fun place to hang out for a Fri night.  Oh well, went to the movies instead so the night didn't prove to be a total waste of time.
