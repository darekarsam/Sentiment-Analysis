4	We came here before a concert recently and had a great Hawaiian Pizza. Their fish sandwich was very good also. The people that work here are fun and friendly. I recommend if you're in the area. Walk straight down the Library's (music hall) steps, through the park and keep going. It's in a strip mall near the Wendy's.
1	I ordered a Pizza with Chicken and Mushrooms. It came with tomatoes on it. The woman was rude and refused to do anything when we called. I drove down there to return it and they still would not refund me.
5	Quality and delicious pizza!! Very good service, very close to my house. I love this place!!! Definitely I will recommend to my friends!!! I love there veggie  lovers pizza
