2	Outside seating only, which leads to some entertaining people-watching.  The other customers at the restaurant when we came by for some comida included three potential drug dealers, a guy who wandered up wearing a marijuana shirt, and a woman who left the possible dealers angrily shouting "You can shut the f*$# up, I am the bride of Jesus Christ!" as she wandered off down the street.  The tables in the seating area hadn't been cleaned recently, and cups containing some strange liquid were sitting on our table as we ate.That said, we had some very friendly service at the window, and my cheese enchiladas were acceptable for the price we paid.  My husband's carne asada was probably not made from the best cut of steak, since it was chopped up into small pieces instead of being served as a strip.Overall, I would look for a hole-in-the-wall Mexican place in this area of town instead of returning.
4	Fantastic tacos. I tried the carne asada and the carnitas. Great flavor and juicy. The salsa doesn't have a lot of flavor, and reminded me of tomato juice.
