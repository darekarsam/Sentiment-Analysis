5	I love this place! They are the only place that takes care in doing my nails and does a decent job for an acceptable price. The tenth fill is free and they do a nice pedicure too. They can do any nail design that you show them a picture of which I love.
5	They know how to do any design that you show them a photo of. Though they sometimes seem confused because of the language barrier, they can really do anything you show them. Both the man and the woman are awesome artists!!
4	I loved the way my powder gel nails turned out however I only gave 4 stars because she didn't do design I asked her to do. She didn't cheetah print...again nice but not what I wanted. Pedicure was nice he didn't rush which I liked. I will go back.
