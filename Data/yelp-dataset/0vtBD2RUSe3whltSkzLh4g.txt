4	Every summer we head out to Scottsdale for a little bit of sun and some pool time.  Since we can only be out in the sun until maybe 1pm, the rest of the day is spent shopping until it cools down. Lacoste is one of my favorite staple stores and Fashion Square is the perfect location for it!  I stopped in on Tuesday afternoon and was greeted by Anthony (cute sales guy), who remember me from my last visit to the store over a year ago!  Now that's what I call customer service.I picked up a couple of the basic shirts and purchased some socks for my favorite yelper, Richard T. and realized this is perfect Lacoste boutique!  It's small, a little bit larger than a walk in closet.  The selection is perfect, and they always have extra's in the back.  And Anthony, who has a great memory was totally helpful.  Why can't the SF store be the same? Such is life...I'll be back for Labor Day!
3	Muffy, Buffy, Taffy and Kippy and I were recently at the mall. Suddenly the heavens sang and the Lacoste Boutique appeared. Wow. A whole store devoted to the gator. What could be better? Well....first of all...how about a selection with more than eight colors to choose from? And $80 a pop. Get real. Unless that gators gonna gnaw on my nipple while I'm wearing it, $80 is way too much.
1	Have been a regular buyer from the Fashion Square Lacoste - then I went in today - and experienced the worst service I have same. ever experienced.  The lady who described herself as the Sales Manager who was working on November 25th - has no business in retail.  Her utter contempt for her customer (Me) only took a couple of minutes but it cost Lacoste all my future business.  Will spend my money elsewhere and recommend others to do the same
