3	Oh look, another shop that sells things and stuff. What stuff? Oh you know, stuff that you want and need. Like key holders and candelabras. That sort of stuff. I'm probably being a bit acerbic and unfair. I just don't really have time for shops that sell 'stuff'.The other thing about this places is the smell. They have a massive collection of candles (duh!), scented and unscented. The thing is, a single scented candle on its own can be quite pleasant. Even a few can be OK. But a whole shop full of clashing scents is positively nauseating. To me anyway. You might like that.I'm not saying this is a bad shop, that wouldn't be fair at all. It's got myriad candles and an impressive greetings card assortment. And loads and loads of stuff. Gifts, some people call them. It's just not for me. I'm told it's because I'm a man and I just don't get it. I don't think I want to either.
