5	Sarah is a FABULOUS Makeup Artist! I am a Model and a Photographer and I work with her on both ends of the spectrum.

You will not be disappointent & You will love your Fabulous and Beautiful Face by Sarah :)
5	Fabulous and Beautiful is right! Sarah is a true professional who really listens to what you want. I have had her do my makeup for formal, casual, and pinup style photo shoots. She does a wonderful job everytime. I am always happy with her work and would recommend her to anyone.
5	Sara did great work on my makeup for engagement pictures and wedding.  Her prices were very reasonable and I was really happy that she uses MAC and other high end makeup.  The first lady I checked into who is in the same price range uses a lot of drug store products, but I had to press to get her to tell me that.  I have problem skin sometimes when I am stressed (I knew my wedding would be one of those times).  She was early to my venue and all ready to go.   She even let me add my at the end (one of my cousins showed up needing help, she forgot her makeup bag and almost refused to come to my wedding).  Sara was really professional, friendly and helpful.      Totally recommend!
