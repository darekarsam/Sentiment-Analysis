5	And love it I do!  This place is quite a bargain.  I stopped in for lunch and for $15, two of us were able to split a combo that included three rolls and 4 pieces of sushi!  The sushi was sprinkled with sesame seeds, which was new to me and enjoyable.  The Montreal roll was also quite tasty.  There is not much here in the way of ambiance, but I enjoyed sitting on the balcony and watching the goings on on the block while dining.  I would highly recommend this place for a delicious lunch.
3	We came here for a little snack , we sat outside on the deck and it was quite comfortable. I liked the vancouver maki (with a big block of cream cheese inside!), but the royal roll (with unagi) didn't really have much unagi in it, and the rice was quite mushy. The salmon sashimi was fresh, but they were really thin slices.One funny thing we found was the tea pot and tea cups were Chinese, plates were French, chopsticks were Japanese, while the napkin rack was Vietnamese.
3	I've had better. We came as a larger group (10) and there was no one else in the restaurant aside from a few take out orders. Took 40 minutes to get our food. The green salad had wilted lettuce and the dressing was not very good. Wasn't a fan if the miso soup either. Too much going on. Wouldn't go back but some at the table really enjoyed it. Nothing to to write home about though.
