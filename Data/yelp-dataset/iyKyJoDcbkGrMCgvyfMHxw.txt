5	Best hookah lounge to be at. Beautiful serviceVery cleanAmazing dealsIt's a great place to come and hang out with friends. Listen to music and play some pool
5	New owners very clean now and a great place to hang out! The new owners are remodeling and adding new seating etc. The staff is very friendly and attentive.
5	New owners changed this place quickly. You'll most likely see a DJ on Friday and Saturday and it's packed with people! The owners are nice and friendly and always make you satisfied. Don't like your hookah they will replace it for you with out saying anything. They are generous and ask people if they need water or anything. Great people great place. The best Hookah spot in the valley! Try it out and you'll never go to another place again! Wide selection of drinks from sodas to teas to energy drinks with snacks and great flavors. This spot can't get any better!!
1	Looked great online and decided to go in!! My friends and I were looking for somewhere fun and relaxing to go... Got to say I was pretty disappointed! Coals took forever and the sheesha was low quality! Went from fresh thick smoke to burnt in less then 5 minutes! Won't be coming here again!
