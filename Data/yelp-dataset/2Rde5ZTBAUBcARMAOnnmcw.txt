5	This dream team of performers made my sons birthday so very special. We had Spider-Man, Batman and TMNT at his party and all the kiddos were so excited. They played games and took photos with them. The kids loved every second of it. My son and his friends still talk about how awesome Spider-Man was. Highly recommend this company. They are professional and really made my sons day more special then I ever imagined.
5	We hired Make Them Believe Parties for my sister's daughters birthday party and it was a huge hit!! We had over 20 kids of all ages, and each one had a blast and received attention from the Cinderella that came. Kimi was professional, helpful, creative, and prompt with all of her planning and communication! I only wish we had hired another character because it was that awesome!!!!We will use this company again and again and again!!!
5	You will not regret hiring this company for your party! It is clear to see that lots of hard work has gone in to preparing each character and making sure each party is spectacular for your special day!!!!
