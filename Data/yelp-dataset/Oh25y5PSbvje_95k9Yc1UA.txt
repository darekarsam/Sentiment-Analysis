1	Prepare to be poorly treated by their rude and billing staff. Had treatment done over a year ago, never received letters or phone calls from them stating that I had a balance due from what insurance didn't cover. Now I've been sent to collections and they have no idea where my account is. Go somewhere else.
1	The staff here is very rude and uncaring. Tried to get  info on the phone and Donna wasted a lot of my time on hold or sending me to voicemail. Eventually she got very snappy and said if I didn't want to wait I should spend a small fortune going to the ER. When I finally got to my appointment the girl at reception wouldn't even bother to greet me but continued her conversation with coworkers. The first thing she said to me was a terse request for my co-payment. The doctors are fine but every time I go for an appointment I have waited an hour to two hours past the appointment time with no explanation or apology. These are just the latest examples of what happens every time for the last two years. I've had it and will now be looking for another medical group.
