2	This Avis location is a pain.My wife rented a car, and the person working at the Avis desk in the lobby wouldn't release the car to me, so I had to drag her down to get the key from the desk agent and then hand it to me.The desk agent also didn't seem very excited about moving the line of customers along quickly, so we waited a very long time for service.Finally, there is not a great return system here either.  You have to bring it to the valet to turn it in.  Well that's fine, except when there is a big sign out front that says Valet Full, and there are no valets around to help you out.  I had to sit in the car for a while until somebody moved the sign for me so I could go up and drop my car off at the full valet lot.
1	tried to call, but they don't pick up the phone. Tried to call the 1-800 # and they kept trying to enroll me in some "plan" that I would  have to cancel in a couple months. WHY? I just wanted to rent a car! We finally went to the Venetian and had their concierge make the reservation. The  girl at the desk was helpful, but they have long lines and one person working. I will never rent from them again.
4	Showed up at the desk without a reservation at 8:10. Was second in line. By 8:40 I was sitting in the car. Only one attendant available. Happy with the experience.
3	It was fine and very convenient. I should have booked online and could have gotten a better rate.
3	Booked our rental online so that part was easy. Day of we got to the desk right at 8:15am and waited in line for like 10 minutes. Kind of a pain. Picking up our car took 2 seconds though - they basically just handed over the keys and set us on our way. The car itself was gorgeous (new Cadillac) and the pickup location in The Venetian garage was very convenient for pick up and drop off (since we were staying at The Venetian). The hours are weird (8am-4pm) so if you need Avis after 4pm, you're pretty screwed. The service was hit or miss
