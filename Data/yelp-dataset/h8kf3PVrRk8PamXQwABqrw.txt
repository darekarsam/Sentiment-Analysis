5	Been going here for years.  The two Turkish guys that run it are brilliant.  I probably only manage in about once a fortnight, but I only have to walk in the door and they're already putting the mocha on heat for me.  I think they know all their regulars by name and preference, and there are plenty of them too.  You don't need to be a well known face to be made welcome though.  Lunchtime soup is to be savoured (it's almost always tomato and basil by the way).  Be sure to ask for bread to accompany.
