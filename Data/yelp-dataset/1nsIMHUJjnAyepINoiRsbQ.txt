5	Very caring staff. Meds were cheaper than taking script to a pharmacy. Just opened so the wait was short.
5	This place is phenomenal! I'm from out of town and wasn't feeling well, so found this place on Yelp. I walked right in, got seen within 10 minutes and left with meds in less than 30 minutes.  Everyone was caring and attentive. I highly recommend!
5	Excellent service. Everyone was very caring and I felt the Dr. listened to. The facility was very clean and it is brand new.
5	Called on Christmas Eve and they said they didn't not have a line. Did not have to wait really long. Great service! The PA was amazing and friendly as well as the assistant. Called my prescription and was able to pick it up on way home. Will go back again if I need to, hopefully not.
