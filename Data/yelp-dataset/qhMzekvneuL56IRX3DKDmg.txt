4	a pretty high-end IGA with a quality fresh produce range, bakery, great range of cheeses, deli, and supermarket. Just around the corner from the Hotel Lord Berri. it's all clean, spacious and well-presented. No-one seems to speak english but it didn't matter - I got by with mime and shitty french.
