3	I don't usually shop at Dollar General, but I was desperate. I was at the eye doctor's a few doors down, and they dilated my eyes. I had recently lost my sunglasses, and didn't want to wear those disposable things they give you. While I waited for the drops to do their thing, I wandered down to Dollar General in hope of finding some cheap but not horrible shades. Sure enough, I found some made in China specials for $3.50.Not only that, I picked up a some nice quality iron hooks for hanging baskets, and some jute twine. In fact, I was pretty surprised at all the garden stuff they had. They sold soil, tools, and all sizes and kinds of planters, for way cheaper than at the nursery or home center. I'll have to remember that next season!
2	Avoid this store unless you want to argue with the rude gray haired man cashier.Twice I've been 'greeted' in a harsh tone to be sure to pickup a cart upon entering. I commented to him his barking comment is unnecessary. Twice he has become argumentative saying it is company policy and he will continue. As an older woman I was somewhat shaken by his defensive attitude.Next door at Sprouts I heard that a customer complained about having an argument with that same Dollar General cashier. So I am not the only one.if Dollar General corporate knew this cashier was alienating customers they would tell him to shut the hell up or worse. As for me I will not be shopping there again.
3	I was in a hurry to get all my shopping done and I needed some more portion sized food containers.  So before I went to Sprouts I popped in here.  Sure enough they had what I wanted at a reasonable price.  But certainly not where I expected to find them, they were three aisles away from the foil and plastic wrap.  Other than the aisles being narrow and families with multiple unsupervised kids it wasn't a bad experience.
