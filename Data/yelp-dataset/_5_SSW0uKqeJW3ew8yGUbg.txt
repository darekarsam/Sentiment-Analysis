5	Steak Pepperoni and Vegetarian Sandwiches were amazing. Our host really suggested amazing sandwiches. Can't wait to go back and try a different sandwich!!
4	The Montreal staple for pies. My favourite slices are the bananalicious, Mille feuille and rock a brownie. I have yet to try the key lime which looks very tempting. For around 20$ you can get a full pie which works out great for birthdays or other parties and will feed 6-8 people. All in all you can't go wrong with this place.
1	The staff didn't know what's really going on on the menu, when I asked (perhaps it's because they share a location (and employees) with the SacWich next door. While other locations I've been to seem decent, this one was unsanitary. When the staff member began handling another customer's order, without washing their hands or using gloves, right after they had just been sweeping and cleaning the floor, that is when I decided that this place was not for me. I'd rather not risk getting sick due to negligence from sub par service standards. Quite a shame really. Of course, the employees didn't notice customers waiting at the counter for about ten minutes. So try out this place at your own risk.
1	Never ever EVER eat one of their sandwich. The "cook" took literally 1 minute and half to prepare two cold sandwiches which were supposed to be Philly Cheese Steak, Meat was stale. Mushrooms were barely defrosted. Avoid at all cost.
