5	PERFECT!!!!  We rented the 'LIL SURF' water slide for my sons 6th birthday party yesterday.  The delivery guy was right on time to set up.  From the phone call  to reserve it (her name was Amy) , to the set up and take down everything was 5 stars!!! We will be definitely renting from this company again.  Better prices then other rentals I called.  Very trustworthy and Amy was so nice on the phone!  Thank you! The kids had a blast and Lil Surf was perfect (and brand new)! Jennifer
5	I called and scheduled my daughter's party with their bouncy/slide, tables, chairs, and games.On the day before the party my HOA decided to lie and say that they didn't receive the insurance certificate from Arizona Inflatables.  When I called and left a message as well as an email about this issue, (on Valentine's day after 8 pm).  They called me right away to resolve the issues.That alone really impressed me that they would go out of their way to make things right and help resolve the issue.The day of the party, they arrived on time, got everything set up, and came back in time to take things down and to take it away.The bouncy was in excellent condition and the portable generator lasted through the party without a hitch.Only thing that bothered me was that couple of the chairs were a bit dirty but that could easily be missed since they are folded and stacked.
1	I witnessed this company / Owners treat parents horrible at the Trunk R treat in Queen creek..they were using profanity ..I would never recommend them. The owners were even really mean and inappropriate.
1	I was very displeased with this company's attitude behavior and unsafe practices.they cuss at kids, We used them once at our house for my kids birthday party. The owner Amy is insanely rude. I do not recommend them.
4	All I can say is alot of food!! We went Mesa, AZ  day and had a reservation. The place was busy, you just look on the wall and order from there. Everything was great, however way too much food for two people.
