5	I love this place looks r deceiving but amazing cheap prices and great work done here....
4	I love this place, I get my nails done here all the time, they always look good, and stay on for a really long time, but the issue that I have is they are not very careful with your nail beds, I always end up with hang nails and bleeding, I wish they where a little more gentle :(
5	The location is not all that great but when you walk in they are welcoming people. My husband daughter and I walked in for a pedicure they Kept my daughter busy while we did our treatment. THEY ARE SOOOOO GOOD WITH IN GROWN TOE NAILS.(my husband had a few) every time I visit arizona this is my nail place to go. Defenetly recommend it. The prices are so inexpensive 15 dollar pedicures with 3 dollar callus remover.
4	This place was  fast, friendly and accommodating. They add the extra touches. They did not offer parfin wax, the hot towels were warm and the language barrier was difficult to work around but their service and attention to detail made this place worth recommending. We will be sure to come back.
