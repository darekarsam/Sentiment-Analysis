5	This shop caught my eye because they had this great book http://www.amazon.com/Birds-Eye-Views-Historic-Lithographs/dp/1568981465/ref=rsl_mainw_dpl?ie=UTF8&m=ATVPDKIKX0DER and these great plates with a map of Fort Duquesne and the 7th ward of Pittsburgh in the window earlier this summer.  This shop is expensive but there are some reasonably priced gift items here too.  I also like their selection of books - lots of interesting things.  Penhollows has a nice mix of art, antiques, home goods and books.  This is one of the most well editied shops I have been to and I enjoy stopping by to see what is new - they put up a whole new display to celebrate the fall and I anticipate that they will change their collection with the seasons.  The last time I stopped in they had some really interesting vintage cufflinks on display as well as some beautiful art work of Western PA.  It looks like the will also have a web shop too.
5	Penhollows always has a neat selection of tempting things. They seem to cater to a variety of budgets and styles, so I find it difficult not to find great gifts here. It's also not an overwhelmingly large store; they're all about quality, not quantity. I can't stand sifting through a bunch of crap to find a gift, so in this way Penhollows and I are right for each other.  I have no experience with their interior design service but I imagine from the items in the store that they have excellent taste and can adapt to a variety of customers!
