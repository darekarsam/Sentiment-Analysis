5	This library is so close to the east liberty shops and development projects. It is a half a block away from the Borders and Walgreens. You can take out a limit of 50 books and they have tables of fiction bestsellers and a great cookbook selection. Good place to go this summer for something to read and not spend a dime...
5	Well, I just moved to Shadyside from Oakland so I'm used to perusing the lovely stacks at CLP Main. I finally made my way here a month after moving and was pleased with the selection. It's not as extensive as main, but it couldn't be since it's much more compact! If you want something from another branch you can request to pick it up here. They also had a lot of computers to use, chairs for sitting to read and a decent magazine selection. It's bright, modern, airy and I have no complaints. Other than I couldn't use the self-checkout because it was being wonky, but that's technology for you :)
5	Great place for East Liberty to have this library and it's so close to my house. I love it here. Also it's nice and quiet here. Great addition for the African American community of east liberty. I love the section of books they have. Come down and visit this awesome place!!!
