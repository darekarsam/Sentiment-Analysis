5	I got the FBI virus and the guys there were very helpful, quick and cheap compared to Best Buy. They seem very trustworthy and did not try to sell me something I did not need. I will keep going to them.Thanks
5	WONDERFUL!  great, smart guys. Have taken my laptop a couple of times. Great service and VERY reasonable priced! Michael Habros is my guy!
5	Mike is great! I had pretty much reached the conclusion that my PC was a lost cause! Nope! He was able to find a compatible motherboard and clean it up! Fast and reasonable! Will definitely use them again!!
5	There was something wrong with my laptop and all of my important files have disappeared! I was really worried and didn't know how to get them back. I went to ... SO wonderful, he got all of them back! Excellent service!
5	Mike is so great! Several people at my office have been going to him for years, and my husband and I started taking our laptops to him. He is super knowledgeable and very trustworthy. I highly recommend him.
5	I absolutely recommend KMJ. Great personalized service. My father recommended Mike and he was right.
5	Really great business practices here. He's helped me repair, build, and troubleshoot my PC(s) multiple times and he's very professional and knowledgeable. I actually stopped by the yelp page to write this review because I'm hoping he can help my upgrade my PC again soon shortly. Highly, highly recommend them for any PC/laptop repair or services.
