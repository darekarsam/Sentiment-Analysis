5	pussy corps is more of an experience than i would say a brothel, u go up the stairs pay i think the fee is $30 canadian which gets un 20 minutes in a theme room, one is a jail cell, one is a class room etc.  and for tips of certain amounts i think it's 10 canadian she will u a vibe on her self while basically sitting on your face.  good times!!
5	Can an establishment have a classier name?I'm not sure if I should be writing a review for this place, or a review for my awesome wife that actually let me bring her here. Every vacation we go on some excursion, whether it be cave diving, zip-lining, dune buggys, etc. well in Montreal they don't have a lot of these things to choose from, but what they do have a lot of is kink, so this became our Montreal adventure. It took a lot of wine beforehand to convince my wife to walk up the seedy stairwell to the second floor, but she eventually mustered the blood alcohol level to pull it off. When the door upstairs opened we were greeted by two girls wearing nothing but their bras, okay I'm thinking, this is already a good time!So you pay a fee to get in which basically covers entry, a private room, a couple free beers, and your choice of dancer. I was surprised when the lady we chose told us her name was "Mercedes". I thought surely outside the US these girls could get more creative with their stripper names, but I guess that's a global stereotype.All I will give away is that it was an experience neither of us will forget, and we left both satisfied and probably a little embarrassed. It was a lot of fun and the girl we chose was very nice and made the whole experience comfortable. The owner was also really cool so feel free to call ahead like we did if you have any questions.If you are looking for an experience outside the repetitive mechanics of a strip club, or the limitations we have here in the states, then this is the place to go.
