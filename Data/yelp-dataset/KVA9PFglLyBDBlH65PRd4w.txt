5	went in to get a birthday cards. omg they had alot of clearance, just in time for birthday,baby gift.
5	Great selection of cards & gifts, friendly service AND they have a post services inside! Literally a one stop shop for gifts of all kinds :)
5	Slingshot SOCK MONKEYS!!! La piece de resistance ;DHonestly, who would have thunk I'd find such a funky & cute item here? ME. lol!When I was searching for stocking stuffers that were different & fun I had to make a stop at Monty's Hallmark to see what new & cute stuff they had. I loved these! The kids did too, young & old :) I do have to warn you though that one of my nieces likes her sock monkey so much that my sister is threatening to make it disappear,,, as in to the bottom of a river, lol. Fortunately we live in a desert & that might be hard to do :)& my sister in law did have to warn my brother & I (we were seeing how close we could shoot at each others heads) that it was all fun & games until someone got hurt :D  Can't wait to see what they get next!
5	Absolutley fantastic customer service ! I wish I knew her name but she was helping me pick out a charm bracelet and charms for a family member christmas gift , and me being a guy that doesn't exactly keep up with trends in jewelry had alot of questions. She very kindly and patiently took her time to explain styles , sizes , and prices of all the items they had to offer. It made my experience an easy oneWay to go Monteys Hallmark !
