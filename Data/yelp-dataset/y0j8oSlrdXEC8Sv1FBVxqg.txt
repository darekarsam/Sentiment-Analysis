4	Ok, a 7-11 is a 7-11. But when I grew up there was an video arcade machine in the 7-11s. Less one star for no streetfighter arcade game.Besides that nothing crazy or new about 7-11s. They have drinks, snacks, and misc grocery stuff. I always thought that 7-11s were convenience stores without the gas station. Well I've been proven wrong about that now since there are 7-11 gas stations... Who would have thunk it!?
3	Its a 7-11 has the basic amenities that most convenience stores have but its tucked into a strip mall parking lot and is facing away from the street making it a hard loop around a back side street to get in from one side and a short back track if you use the other direction.  The store has always been clean and the employees friendly. I've stopped in for a Slurpee after visiting my dry cleaners and will continue to do so as long as the temp is triple digits.
4	As everyone here says, a 7-11 is a 7-11. The service at this particular location is on point, the people that work here are personable and cool. It's interesting to people watch at a 7-11, and I love seeing the varied clientele. They have a few video poker machines here if you like playing poker in a 7-11. The iced coffee is usually what I chose here, and it's a great value. $2.15 for a large!! The kids like the Slurpees and from time to time I get Vanilla Coke from the awesome soda machine here. If your adventurous or entering a cast iron stomach contest, belly up to the counter and get a slice of pizza or some breakfast taquitos!!One other awesome thing they sell here are the giant pickles in the bag, which are kick a$$!!
