4	I was so happy to see that Macy's has a small Lush tucked away in it's cosmectics department! I've only been to Lush in San Francisco and absolutely love their products but refuse to order online and pay more for shipping than the products. Their stuff is hand made from mostly organic ingredients and they use little or no preservative. I've been nothing but happy with their stuff and found some new goodies this time around like lip scrub and solid perfume. Employees at this location were super friendly and knowledgeable, good thing I don't live in Pittsburgh because a good chunk of my paycheck would be spent at Lush.
5	I am a huge fan of LUSH, but not a huge fan of their normally overly pushy salespeople.  This Macy's location is an exception--you can browse in peace, and they will help if you need it.Doesn't hurt that it's a mile from my house.  LOVE! Hope it stays open forever!
