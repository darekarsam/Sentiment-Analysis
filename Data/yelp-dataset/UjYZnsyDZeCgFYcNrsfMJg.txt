4	Good selections along with friendly service. A lot of discounts and deals year round! A little bit of everything here at Champs :) Wish they carried larger sized shoes...
1	Rude uninformed staff that needs to take care of their hygiene before going to work.  The place reeks and they do not honor advertise specials. Save yourself tge time and hassle Foot Locker is around the corner.
1	Good shoes but employees really have bad attitude and do not want to help you. Rather buy online then deal with them and it smells Bad.
1	The worst experience at this location. I wanted 4 different pairs of shoes and the guy helping me kept bringing me the wrong shoes. When I got home I realized that he forgot to ring up one of the pairs. Had to get them the next day. Day after, I went to put on my new gym shoes to find out he gave me two right shoes. So went back to get the correct ones and they wouldn't let me speak to a manager and said they can't do anything more than give me the correct shoes. For all the inconvenience I would have expected an apology and maybe a discount my next trip. I got nothing.
