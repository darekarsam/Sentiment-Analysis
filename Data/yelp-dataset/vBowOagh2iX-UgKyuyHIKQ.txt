5	Battery went out on my daughters car, they tested it and found out that it was bad.  Very friendly.
5	Great staff they even installed the light bulbs over my lisc plate for me(it was a hassle too but he didn't mind). Thank you
4	I rate a 4 because the customer service with JC needs to improve a little more.. Stopped in tonight to exchange brake pads and get a refund for my brake rotors , overall I do like shopping here for my parts though
5	Definitely like shopping there. I've gone a couple times already and the service was great. I went in today to purchase a 5qt jug of Castrol oil and a micro guard filter for 24.99. They were out of the micro guard filters. I asked if I could upgrade to a Bosch for 2 bucks like it said it in the ad. Apparently that was for a different kind of oil. As I was leaving Alex told me he would ring me up for the initial 24.99 price with the Bosch filter so i wouldn't have to drive to another o'reillys. I really appreciate that, I will definitely be coming back soon.
