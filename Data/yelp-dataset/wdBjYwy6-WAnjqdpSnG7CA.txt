1	It's one thing to charge a $12 minimum for a ride less than a half a mile away. It's another thing to inform someone of this after you've arrived at the destination. On top of that this guy didn't even have any change. What a scheister!
1	Nice to see some yahoo driving like a maniac and smoking his cigarette in the "non-smoking" limo. I wouldn't rent from these guys on a bet.
1	Driver was late and while we were waiting added another person who was also waiting for same sedan service, driver was rude and doubled the charge. We had no choice but to go with them in order to catch our plane. Very rude driver and will never use them again
