3	Still brand new and working out kinks. The Brussels sprout salad is terrific. The fries are hand cut and delicious.
4	Despite the fact that the Charlotte Center City isn't the best hotel in town, it has a pretty good restaurant located in it, and is one of the best aspects to the hotel.Stuff is on the pricier end here, and it seems needlessly so, but the stuff ain't bad. For dinner one night, I had the po boy shrimp sandwich and it was very good.Several of the days I went here there was a great breakfast buffet. Way pricey at almost $20 bucks, but had a good selection. For whatever reason, there was no buffet on Thursday morning, so I had the egg sandwich with bacon and cheese. It was very greasy, not bad, but it seemed like a bunch had been made that morning and this guy was just heating up under a lamp.Other evenings I had tea and beer. Not the biggest selection of the latter, but some nice  local beers.One of the best aspects of the place was the service. Top notch service here. Not a single iota of complaint or critique. Keep on keepin on.Also, the music they play in the background here is just darn good. I'm sure the employees get sick of it, but it isn't your regular Muzak. It's pretty classy. I'm sorry if you get stuck at this hotel site for other reasons, but the restaurant and bar won't be one of them.
2	One would expect the dining facility in a Shearton Hotel to be top notch, not here.  Food is over priced for the bland taste you get.  Service is terrible.  I had a burger and fries ($15) that was only modestly better than what you'd get from a fast food place.  I had to ask someone to take my order, I had to ask for drink refills, I had to ask for the check, and I even had to then ask someone to take my money to play my bill.  Very poor experience.
