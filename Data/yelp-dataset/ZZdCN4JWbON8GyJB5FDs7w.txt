4	This is the original Bojangles, but they have many locations around town.  Bojangles is Charlotte's rip-off of Popeye's, and it's delicious.  They have great deals on chicken dinners, and tender chicken supremes.  The macaroni and cheese and the seasoned fries are the best side items on the menu.  The biscuits are out of this world, and you usually get a hot one.  If you are feeling decadent I recommend the sweet potato pie or the bo'berry biscuits.  The only reason I give this place 4 stars is that it is a fast-food restaurant, so the service is spotty- make sure to check that you got everything you ordered.
5	Bojangles is basically my favorite fast food restaurant of all time. Picture this: buttery biscuits, fried chicken, dirty rice, seasoned fries, and sweet tea - god, it's amazing. For breakfast my favorite is the chicken biscuit and bo rounds (aka tater tots)..but sometimes, when I'm feeling frisky, I'll get the bo-berry biscuits..biscuits with blueberries in them covered in frosting - D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S! Bojangles is my hero...
4	chicken was deliciously greasy!! yummy!!! lol i could only eat it once a year. the are probably the most original place to eat home-style fried chicken. it's just sooooo gooooood!! the service was friendly and i would it if they delivered to AZ or build one out here.
3	This location is your standard Bojangles fare. Good food. Once you get inside past the panhandlers that are at the front door on occasion.
1	Every time I go to this location, the drive thru employees are rude. I haven't been in awhile because of this, after today I will not go back. Drove up and the person said just a moment, waited 5 minutes and then said excuse me.. Just a second.. Several minutes went by..nothing. I finally left, I'll take my business elsewhere. At least say sorry for the delay and check if I'm still there, instead of completely ignoring me.
