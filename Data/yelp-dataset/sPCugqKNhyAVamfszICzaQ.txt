5	Such a relief to find such an honest, hardworking professional that knows what he's doing and one that doesn't charge an arm and a leg! We are SUPER satisfied with Hayden Mason's work! He installed three pendant lights over our kitchen island and did a beautiful job of it! We will definitely call on him if the need ever arises. We highly recommend him! THANK YOU Hayden!
5	I had some outlets that were not working in an upstairs loft so I called Affordable Las Vegas Electrician. He was on time, quickly found the problem, showed me what the problem was and then fixed it for less than $100. Will definitely use again.
5	Absolutely amazing. They redid my down stairs with 8 can lights and it looks great. Hayden was extremely fair priced and professional. The work was done with no dry wall repair needed. I will be using them for the rest of my home for sure. Hayden also added in a dimmer and made my room perfect. Highly recommend and fairly priced.
