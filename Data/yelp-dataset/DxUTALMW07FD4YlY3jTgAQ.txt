4	This is a great neighborhood hardware store. It's actually called Quincaillerie Delorimier, but it's affiliated with the Rona chain. I live a block away and have conducted extensive renovations over several years with the help of this place. Of course I try to buy as much materials as I can at Reno Depot or Home Depot. The big boxes are cheaper, but if I just need a small item I can save myself a time-consuming car trip by walking down to Rona. They have a pretty complete selection of building supplies and tools, even if you are paying maybe 50% more than the big boxes.They have a large staff of reasonably knowledgeable young guys who stand around waiting to answer your questions. This is a big plus when you are trying to solve some home repair problem.

4	As others have said, this shop isn't huge and doesn't have everything, but it has pretty much anything you'll need for basic repairs and around-the-house needs. The guys working here are great, and are happy to help you think through projects. And if it turns out that your crazy idea didn't work, returns are easy. Yay, hardware.
