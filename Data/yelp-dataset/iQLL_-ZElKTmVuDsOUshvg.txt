5	The team opens folks with open arms.  Whether sitting at the coffee station stools or at one of the tables.  Yes- there is some hipness but they're human too :)Coffee is solid - they're sourcing good beans. Baked goods and sandwiches.  Haven't gone for the glory of one of their smoothies - just yet. :)
5	Great coffee, try the smoothies. My favorite is the Marquette detox! I love the panini chicken&brie called the bro!  One of a kind!
