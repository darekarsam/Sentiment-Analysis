5	Chang's is my first choice for a mechanic. The prices are reasonable and they explain what they are going to do very clearly. My car was ready two hours before they said it would be done, which was really impressive. I'm from the Midwest and my car is quickly succumbing to rust.  I don't think a mechanic has ever finished on time with that car. I am thoroughly impressed by their friendly service and the quality of their work. I will be recommending them to everyone I know from now on!
5	Really great! places charges by hour so they take sweet time, but chang's did it in just a hour exact! and they tell you everything without the bullshit!i recommend this place a 6 but the stars only go up to 5.
