5	Okay, so many of you have had the experience of getting your bluh.da (blood) drawn and have to wait in those crappy offices for an unknown amount of hours. Well, I was mixed about giving this review because then you all would go there & change it's fabulous aura! But I just had to give props to the two girls who work there... Rea and I'm sorry I didn't get the other girls name, but they ROCK-N-ROLL at their jobs!! It's always just the two of them & I have never waited more than 30 min. and then they are really sorry for that. Seriously, they are awesome! The office is carpeted & nicely decorated... not all sterile & cold. Thank you Sonora Quest for having this diamond in the rough!  You Go Girls :)
5	i have been to this office several times since I live so close,  i normally make an appointment which makes it easier to get in when they are busy as long as you arrive a little earlier than your appointment.  today I had an 8am appointment and arrived at 7:45.  there were several people ahead of me, but I got in almost immediately and was out of the office at 8:02  Great office and they are a very friendly staff
1	Slowest lab around, in an hour of waiting have only called back maybe 6 patients.  Have had to come to this location before and it is always like this.  For an office this busy, they really need to put some effort into getting people taken care of.  Don't know if they just don't have enough employees or if they just don't have the right ones.  Something needs to change.
