4	I have used this Cheynes salon twice and think that it offers a good haircut for not much more than barbers' prices, especially if you are a student where you receive a 40% discount on your first visit and a 15%/25% discount during the week thereafter depending on whether you go there in the morning or afternoon. When booking over the phone it is important to state what type of stylist you want, because I discovered that the receptionist automatically arranges a haircut with a higher charging hairdresser, which for me personally would be a waste of money as my hair doesn't require much to be done to it and a general stylist would suffice for my needs.I found the service Cheynes offers very good, they offer you a complimentary drink of your choice and I found the staff very welcoming and easy to talk to and was even able to have the same barber shop banter over football but with a guaranteed good cut to match. I had by haircut my a guy called Blair and his haircut was fantastic and will definitely be requesting him again next time!I would however suggest against purchasing any hair product from the salon itself as when I enquired about the price of hair wax it was nearly double the price than you can get over the internet.

I had Lisa as my stylist and she gave me exactly what I wanted and was great to chat with. They also have a great student discount (although it was still more $$ than what I am used to paying for a cut) and I got a class of champagne while she snipped away. Highly recommend!
