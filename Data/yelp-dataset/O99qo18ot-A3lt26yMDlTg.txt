1	Worst customer service ever!! This is the first bad review I have ever given. The female workers there were out right rude! The only helpful worker was the only male there and he didn't know too much about the stores products I will go out of my way to never shop here again ... And this is coming from someone who has worked in customer service so I get what a bad day is like but there was absolutely no feasible excuse for acting like that
3	My barber had me run and get some clippers from this location and I really wasn't in here to experience much of a disaster that was described by a previous review. Quick in and out! They always ask do you want a Sally's card and ummm yeah they won't be getting $5 a month from me especially because I don't shop here enough to even need one!
2	The lay out was kind of confusing. I could find anything. No one really helped me either even though I had asked for some. the girl behind the register said someone will be right with me and no one ever showed up. I ended up finding what I needed on my own after wondering the entire store a couple of times. I gave two stars because the products in the store are good. Too bad everything else wasn't.
1	They're too busy gossiping with one another to help customers.  I live right across the street but I'm going to drive out of my way to go to the next location on Boulder Highway.  Wish me luck.
