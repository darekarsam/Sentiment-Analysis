5	I'm extremely impressed with Discount Towing in Phoenix.  Unlike other times I have needed a tow and used AAA in the past, Lloyd with Discount Towing was quick to respond, even though it was a VERY early morning call.  I just recently moved to Arizona and had no idea what type of Phoenix tow service would come out.  AAA came through for me as always, but I was very impressed with the service I received from Todd.  Since I'm new to the area, Lloyd referred me to a small mechanic shop by my house that was affordable and quick to get me back on the road. I would definitely recommend this towing service. Bravo!
5	My morning started off as some what of a roller coaster.  Car trouble right before work is never a good way to start the day.  I quickly found a ride to work and waited until lunch to handle the dead weight that was sitting in my driveway.  I called rapid towing and spoke to Karen.  She was very soft spoken and professional.  I was able to pay with my credit card over the phone and make arrangements to have my car taken to a repair shop.  Ive always feared dealing with tow companies. I thank Karen for making this experience an easy one.
5	Very friendly over the phone and in person. Lloyd showed up less then 30 minutes from the time i made the call. He was professional and friendly.
