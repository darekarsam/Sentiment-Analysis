5	Five stars! Easily! Tim, the host, is so accommodating, staying here was like going home for a visit. Tim keeps a well stocked breakfast kitchen available 24/7. As new guests arrive, Tim introduces everyone so you all know each other and who you are staying with. Intimate enough for a couple but perfect to meet a travel buddy for singles. The rooms are well kept. Enough pool chairs for everyone.  The pool is warm enough to not be shocking but cool enough to still be refreshing! Not a single bad spot for tanning. Shade was just a quick step away under the outdoor awnings. Quiet neighborhood. Centrally located. Quick drives to each bar or an Uber driver was always within 8 mins away.  Tim has plenty of recommendations of bars, restaurants, and hikes. A fantastic getaway from a long cold winter!
5	I just got back from the Inn and had a great time. From my first call, owner Tim was very friendly and helpful. I told him what kind of room I wanted and he reserved the perfect room. The guy is a great host and the resort is the perfect blend of modern/elegant and comfortable/warm. The pool is heated (nice even in summer) and the landscaping is beautiful. My friend and I were blown away. We even got great recommendations for meals. AND the prices are very reasonable, a very good value.All gay and clothing optional! This place is a total winner.
5	This is my fourth time coming here. I accidentally found it when one of my flights got cancelled. Tim is very friendly and a very accommodating host.Every year I make it a point to come back just to relax and do absolutely nothing by the pool.
