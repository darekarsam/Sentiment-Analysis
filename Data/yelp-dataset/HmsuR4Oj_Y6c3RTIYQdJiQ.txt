5	Great place for some fresh made by hand pretzels, that are not part of a large chain of stores (like at the mall).  My kids love these pretzels and we highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great soft pretzel.
5	We just stopped once - but as far as I can tell they are pure Philly style - loved them!
4	Christmas Treat!!!Today I bought candy cane shaped pretzels!!!   Wonderful for holiday parties.  You can even serve them with soup or salad.  Twenty seconds in the microwave( i know some may cringe) and wonderful perfection.To Amy C...Did you ask them to warm the pretzels and cheese for you?
5	Authentic Philly soft pretzels with the proper consistency and taste.  In Philly, they are eaten plain or with mustard, but they do accommodate with different toppings and flavors.   You won't find better pretzels in Vegas if you appreciate the real thing.
5	Now I'm addicted fresh baked soft pretzels.  The business is still new and working out the details, but they do know soft pretzels!
1	Disappointed. The dip is cheese whiz?! Really? Only regular salted pretzels that were cold and hard. Not what we were really hopping for. I had hopped for specialty, maybe a pizza pretzel! The filled kind. Wont be returning
1	You would think that the pretzels would be soft and fresh. I ordered a basic pretzel and had them warm it for me. When I bit into it, it was tough and tasted like something you would expect from a heat lamp box at a gas station.  Thank the stars I only ordered one. I was thinking about getting a couple to take home when I pulled in the parking lot. Once I got inside, nothing inspired me to want more.
