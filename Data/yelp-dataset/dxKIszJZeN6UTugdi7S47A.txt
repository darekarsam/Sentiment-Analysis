4	An almost 'blink and you'll miss it' cafe with superb views of the castle, Blackcherry is a brilliant little place for a coffee and a chat in a relaxed and charming atmosphere. Food is locally sourced and generally brilliant although I have had a few occaions which i have been slightly dissapointed - but I have always returned, because the food is outstanding when they get it right, so it is worth the risk.Blackcherry is a great little place to spend some time relaxing and generally just watching the world go by.
