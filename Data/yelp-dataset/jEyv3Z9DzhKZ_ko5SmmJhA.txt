3	Great location, staff is super friendly. They are always very polite and greet you with a warm smile!!! My one small observation is that the staff seem to replicate robots: My pleasure!! My pleasure, but do they mean it!!! NO I doesn't seem that way. As they continue to greet and smile and constantly say My pleasure there is almost for certain a smirk and (I'm not looking at you I'm only doing my job) look or a short roll of the eyes. The food is good , clean and my kids enjoy the play area. Therefore I must give this establishment/location 3 stars.
4	This is one of the busiest Chick-fil-A because it is on Independence Blvd. The staff if friendly and your meal is served quickly. Have used both the drive through and dine in at the restaurant. Always order the Chick-fil-A Chicken Sandwich, Waffle Fries- they are so addicting and unsweetened ice tea. It's like a weekly treat.
5	Exactly what you expect from Chick Fil A.  Consistent food, and great service and a clean restaurant.  Definitely the best of the fast food chains and this one is definitely good.  Only drawback is that is usually very busy, but that is a testament to the food and the experience.
5	Love this Chick Fil A. The workers are always friendly and welcome you as you walk in. Great location on Independence as it's not busy with only one by Mathews. The food as always is good and the store is always clean. Just a good Chick Fil A store.
