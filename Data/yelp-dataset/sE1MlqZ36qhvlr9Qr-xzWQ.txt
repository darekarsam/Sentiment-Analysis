5	Rena McDonald and her law group are an amazing group of people.  They have helped me and my family tremendously.  Rena is a strong intelligent woman that will tell you where you stand and if she can help you or not.  She does not sugar coat things or falsely lead you even if its not what you want to hear.  She is genuine and caring about your situation and truly wants to help.  My family and I have used Rena and her office of wonderful people to assist us in both a bankruptcy and short sale.  Both situations I believe would not have been possible without Rena and her office.  I an so thankful that we found her.  I would highly recommend McDonald Law Group for any of your legal issues.  Watching her in our hearings interact with other officials and attorneys you could tell she had a great reputation within her field and to me that speaks volume.  You want someone representing you that has a good reputation not someone that has to advertise on TV with a one liner to get your business.
5	Rena is amazing! At a very difficult time in my life she was there to help. My children and I can never thank her enough for being so caring and yet strong when we needed her to be. Her whole office staff is fantastic!
