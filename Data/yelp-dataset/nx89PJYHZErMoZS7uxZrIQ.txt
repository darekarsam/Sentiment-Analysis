3	Good Chinese delivery.  Nothing to die for, but solid food at good prices.  I've had the cold sesame noodles, which were good, though not spicy at all.  The hot and sour soup has nice tofu in it, but could be hotter and sourer.  Pork fried rice is good, though the rice is kind of a strange yellow-orange color.  This will probably be my go-to Chinese delivery in Squirrel Hill.
3	Average menu, average food, average prices.
2	I've order General Tso's chicken and disappointed. It wasn't sweet, tangy, or red enough and the sauce was too watery.
