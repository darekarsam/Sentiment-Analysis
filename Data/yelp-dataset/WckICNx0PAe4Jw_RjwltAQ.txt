5	Regarding Terry Talbot of Talbot Photography in Madison WI--- I want to tell people what a great job Terry did in photographing Faye and I during our commitment ceremony...We really loved his creativity in catching candid moments, as well as setting up some of the "required" shots in a comfortable and assuring manner. His compositions and colors are magnificent---and I say this being a professional artist myself! We absolutely endorse Terry Talbot for photography of ANY kind!!
5	Talbot Photography did a great job at my wedding. He and his assistant seamlessly handle formal high definition shots that need organization of large groups and fun candid/art shots as well. Mr. Talbot also did portraits of my sister who is a musician which look fabulous.  The turn around time on getting the photos was really fast as well. I would definitely recommend him to anyone.
5	Talbot photography did a fabulous job at my wedding as well as for portraits of my sister. Terry Talbot and his assistants were very personable and were able to make those around feel at ease. I definitely recommend him for events and portraits.
5	I first worked with Terry when I needed a photographer for my mother's 85th birthday party. He was recommended to me by family friends who had hired Terry for both weddings and family photographs. Terry did an excellent job photographing my mother's birthday party. The photos were very nice and my mother and the whole family loved them. I later hired Terry to do the photography for my son John's high school graduation, and again later to take the photos at my daughter's college graduation party. Terry last worked for me when he did my family reunion last year. Terry does a great quality job, and is very reasonable in his pricing. I'd recommend him highly to anyone looking for someone special to do their photography for them.
