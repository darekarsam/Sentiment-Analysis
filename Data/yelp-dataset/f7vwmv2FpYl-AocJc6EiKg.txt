5	Really nice people. Lots of stock.  They helped us with a repair and were very fair on price.  If you are looking for office furniture this is a great place to check.   Get you gps going.  It's tucked away and you need help finding it.
5	Wayne at Jerry's is AWESOME. I cant tell you how the actually facility is because all I had to do what send Wayne what I was looking for in an email and he got it for me for an awesome price! I had a really bed experience with another company and Wayne made it all better, he got me the exact desk I was looking for! Thanks again for making my day!
5	Wow Jerry, nice dump of a place, but have you got the goods, or what? ...and your prices, are you serious!!?I really appreciated the wide selection, and found exactly what I wanted, and within my budget. I had to ask for help (a trade off for not being bugged by a salesperson) but once I did, you were on it, thanks James!These guys are here to serve, and was I surprised by the professional care I received from what, at first, appeared to be a first class dump, but boy was I in for a treat!James took care of making sure the delivery boys brought their tools necessary to drill me a hole in the desktop for my monitor cables (complete with gasket), and remembered the lockset I requested in a passing remark. Having the hole drilled at my office took the guess work out trying to figure out where it should be, while at Jerry's.Delivery was on-time, courteous crew, and very professional install. I will enjoy this desk for many, many years - Thanks Jerry, and James!
