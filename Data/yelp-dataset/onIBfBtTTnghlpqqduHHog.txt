4	I have been coming to this gas station since I was 20 years old, so over 20 years, lol! They have been through countless owners and management but 1 thing hasn't changed! They are the cheapest gas station in the Scottsdale/Phoenix/Paradise Valley area. Just remember to bring cash or they will slip in a .35 cent or more charge for using plastic! Also if you are a woman build up some muscles to pull that thing to your tank, it's a little tough. Most importantly, their the cheapest!!!Right now $2.99 a gallon, so go full up! Maybe ill see ya there! :-)
2	Staff was nice. However...Don't let the posted prices deceive you! When using a card (debit or credit), there is a 35 cent charge on top of the gas total.Also, pump ran 9 cents before the pump actually started pumping fuel.
4	I've been going here for years now. the guys are friendly and I have to say that even though this station is an Am/Pm, their gas is really good. I have gone to other AM/PM's and always had pinging and knocking. But not here. Plus, they have diesel for my F350! Only reason I gave a 4 star rating rather than 5 is due to them needing to clean their driveway more often. They do have a pidgeon problem there.
