5	Mark and his team at Auto Glass Perfection did a great job for me. I had about 5 small chips in my window and Mark suggested repair vs. replace. I thought "what the heck, if that's what you think", not realizing he was saving me a ton of dough and making my windshield perfect. I appreciate his integrity and follow thru and will happily refer business when given the opportunity. Thanks for your help Mark!
