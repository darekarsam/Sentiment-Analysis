5	The prices here are always the best so I do not shop for travel deals anymore.  Now I have more time for vacations...LOL
5	I have used Fanda travel for hotel , car, reservations and soon will be making a cruise reservation they have always had the best price thank you
5	Recently used Fanda Travel to book a Pebble Beach Golf Vacation.  The website offers every tool possible, and Robert's personal service allowed me to get the best price on a first class, once in a lifetime vacation
5	My colleagues and I had to book a work trip to Vancouver. Price point and location was extremely important, and everything was out of our budget. I reached out to Robert, and he found us the best flight deal,  and the apartment/hotel fell within a mile of our convention. Quaint, lovely and priced perfect.
