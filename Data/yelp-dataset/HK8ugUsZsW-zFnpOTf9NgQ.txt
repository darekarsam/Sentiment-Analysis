4	We were looking for a late lunch and a warm spot from which we could watch the snow fall. We got yummy food from Morocco and the Middle East. Mint lemonade and hummus and salads come with the menu. I ordered mint tea. It doesn't get more authentic than this.

I also ordered mint tea. No black or green tea (or caffeine), but I was not disappointed. This is not from a tea bag! I had merguez and lamb kebab and my husband had the jerk chicken and Persian beef. We liked the lamb best.
