4	I found David when I had drove across town to get my tint done by another vendor at the Park N Swap. I was referred by many others of a price range I should expect, but when I arrived - it was doubled! I drive a 2005 Mustang Hardtop and no one would do my tint for what I had budgetted. I googled what was in the area and I called LG Window Tint. David originally quoted me the same price, but I took the time to explain my situation and he accepted what I had! I am so grateful and my Stang looks wonderful! David even took the time to take me and my friend where we wanted to go while my car was being done!The only reason why I am not giving a full 5 stars is because of the time it took. When I returned back to the shop (early) I noticed the technician goofing off and I had to continuously remind him that  I was watching.It took a major toll on my plans, but I would still recommend David and LG Window Tint!!
