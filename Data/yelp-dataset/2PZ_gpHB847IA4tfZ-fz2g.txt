5	Good food, healthy options, reasonably priced. I hope this business sticks around.
4	Would be my favorite place to eat for pizza, the atmosphere is just so dry. Not to many people eat in so it's best to take out.
2	I ordered via Grubhub this evening: 1 Tiramisu  and I received Cheesecake- no fruit topping and not note why they sent Cheesecake1 Traditional White Crust Pizza [10" Small Pizza, Tomato Sauce, [Fresh Mozzarella Cheese, Mushrooms, Baby Spinach]]   and I received a dry bland pizza crust with mushroom, spinach and melted cheese- no tomato sauce, is this really pizza?1 Broccoli Puffs- these were a bit tough & chewey, but the filling was good.Needless to day if you can't get 2 of the 3 menu items correct there is an issue.
