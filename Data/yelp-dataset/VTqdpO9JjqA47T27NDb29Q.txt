4	Some really polite and informed staff here. good selection. Gamecube used games are now at the Game Stop at te Blvd Mall. Good place all the same.
5	I guess maybe it's just Game Stop's in general, I've had very few experiences as a whole with them that were negative.  This one in particular has a really great staff that are friendly, funny and know alot about the products they are selling
3	This is an alright place the staff is alright they are not very helpful unless you ask them to be but they have the games. but there is another game store not far from this one and it caries the new games to it is cheaper there and they even have all of the classics. so game stop is my second choice on this road.
3	This GameStop is ok in my book. I got a new PSVita for xmas and I went in to eye new games. The staff could be a tid bit more Intelligent and well informed. I tend to hate shopping where you ask an employee about something in their department and in this case it is not a department its the entire store and the staff members have no clue as to whats going on. Where are the new PSVita games? I don't know. Its like come on you work in a small store and you don't have any idea where the games are? I wont bore you just I will finish up by saying they need to get it together. I give 3 stars total because they had a lot of games and thank GOD I can read! I got 6 games total and left happy even tho the staff has a huge lack of knowledge of video games.
