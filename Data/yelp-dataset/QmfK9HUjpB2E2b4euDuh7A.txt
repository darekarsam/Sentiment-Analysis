5	As a pool owner in Az Companies come and go. I have been taken more than once. I found Peoria pool and electric. Located on Grand Ave Peoria Az. I have finally found a Company who does great work. There prices are very reasonable.Geoff is there repairman. He has replaced our salt water chlorinator,filter system. This week he will replace our Pump motor. He has always been on time. The owner has always given me honest answers, and never pushed any additional parts or cost. The job price quoted is all you pay. I highly recommend them for any pool work. My e-mail is pneuner750@gmail.com
5	I just wanted to give an update on this company. I tried to do some different programming on my pool pump. Needless  to say I screwed it up. I called and spoke to the owner, he sent Geoff out the next day to redo the programming. I have found that Companies that are established want to keep customers happy. I will only use  companies that have established reputation. There prices are fair. There work is excellent. Just remember you get what you pay for. I am happy they are close by. And willing to help. Just to let readers know that new pump has already saved me at least 25.00 a month on electric.
5	Amazing service and extremely friendly!  I have a Hayward Northstar and they know the tricks that the other pool stores have no clue about.  They also rebuilt my motor which saved me over $200!  Highly recommend them.  I will definitely use them again and again for all of my pool needs.
5	Fast, local service. My technician David was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable. Their price beat two others I researched and they were available the same day! I reccommend them fully!
