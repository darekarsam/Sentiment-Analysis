3	Coffee was crack in a cup but nasty tasting. The grand slam was half the taste of Denny's and the cakes were half the size. The service was excellent. Thanks Brandon.
4	Very good battered dipped fish, cole slaw bland, fries came barely warm. Service is fast for crowd, very nice and friendly staff. I'll go back for the fried cod. Did have to exchange coffee cup. It had some funk dried and stuck to the inside wall.

1	Service was slow. Portions were small. 1st pot of coffee I got was cold. Took 10 minutes to get Hot coffee. Ordered egg whites, sausage, home fries, Buttermilk pancakes and grits. After waiting everything was cold except the grits. I had to wait for a complete do over. When I finally  received  my order the portions were smaller than the orginal order, but everything was hot.  I would only recommended this resturant if you aren't to hungry and have plenty of time to kill. Prices I were too high for the portions they serve. I guess they need to do that to give a free slice of pie on Wednesdays
