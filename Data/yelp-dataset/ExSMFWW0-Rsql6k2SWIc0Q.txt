4	Love this concept!! Bring you doggy to eat with you.Passed by this place and had to go in!!Everything is modern, & clean. At each table there is a metal ring you can tie your dogs chain to. If you don't want to eat but have errands to run, you can leave them with the indoor dog park workers for a low cost of 3$ an hour.This place is also a kennel that actually let's your dog play all day instead of being stuck in a cage till you get back!If you want your dog washed and pampered, they do that too!Love it! The food was also surprisingly good considering it is a doggy restaurant. I didn't have the wine but I saw a lot of woman holding their dogs in their laps and enjoying the terrace with a nice glass of wine. Will return! If you are a proud parent of a 4 legged baby! Check it out!
