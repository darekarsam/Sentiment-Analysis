4	This is a pretty decent restaurant for what it is. It's a fairly inexpensive place that serves pasta and pizza. What really helps it is the fact that it's a bring your own wine restaurant.The location and the decor are quite good. I really have nothing negative to say. I've been a few times, and it's usually very good.If I have one complaint, the last time I went, my pizza was obviously sitting around for a few minutes before it made it to my table.
4	Food is amazing. Pasta is definitely their specialty and really it is great value. The district is a little different but worth it.
1	The four of us found the menu and service too confusing to stay.  Our Quebecois friends took us next door for something easy breezy.  Besides, we wanted a larger degree of freedom and choice on our last night in the city.  We just didn't want pasta or pizza.
3	First time going there. Food is good. You have to try the disco ball washrooms!
2	I really enjoyed the pizza.. & the meat platter but its too far for me to go all the way there I mean ive been there a couple of times.. nothing special but its deffintally good pizza
5	People seem to not know what they are talking about when they review this establishment.  Super nice waitress, super awesome spot on the patio, amazing decor inside and disco party bathroom! BYOBottle of wine!  Yes, the menu is in French but most of it is understandable and there is a little menu dictionary on the back, but we just asked the waitress what her favorites were and she led us in the right direction.  Escargot in a pink sauce and ceasar salad were super yumm! I ordered the cream pasta with jumbo shrimps and bree cheese.  If you like cream and cheese this is a dish for you.  I ate the whole thing but it was very rich.  Maybe ask for less cream next time.  My friend had a pasta dish with cream and chicken that was also super good.  Great experience, great food and definitely recommend!
