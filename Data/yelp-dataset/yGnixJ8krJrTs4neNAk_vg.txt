3	Verizon has become with the new iPhone a real compeitor to AT&T.  The cellphones are slightly different ( you cannot use the internet while talking), but Verizon seems to be the better choice.  The folks who work here are very nice and friendly and more than willing to help you switch over.Enjoy!
5	Caleb, Anthony and Jordan did a great job for us. They are smart, helpful, patient and knowledgeable about the best deals and best phones for you. They are extremely good salespeople and telephone tech experts. Phyllis and Sam Kaminsky
5	This is the best Verizon store I have ever been in. After 10 years with Verizon, I've been in a few! All the people there are courteous and knowledgeable. I have never had to wait long for help either. I would highly recommend this store!
5	Alex does a superior job managing this location. She is VERY knowledgeable (as is Anthony) but she really literally knows everything. She is always calm and polite, particularly because they always seems understaffed with 3 or 4 people in line. Alex goes above and beyond for her clients daily.Warm regards,Laurie Malone
5	I've done a review on this store before, and nothing has changed -- superior service with extremely knowledgeable and courteous people. I get all my Verizon needs taken care of in this store, and I have never had to wait more than a few moments. I wanted to give a special shout out to Alex who dealt with all my issues with patience and a very high degree of competence. With a staff like this and the ease of being helped right away, I would highly recommend this store once again!
