5	Dr Arthur knows how to fix everybody! Even us other Chiropractors! sincerely his patient, Dr Francis Bruce Marion
5	I just have to say that Dr. Berman is awesome! He came in on his day off to help me when my back seized up unexpectedly. In general, he is not pushy like many chiropractors can be (he'll happily see you as needed and then let you schedule freely after that). I've been going to chiropractors all my life and so I thought maybe I knew the gamut of adjustments, but he actually had a couple unusual ones that work wonders. I highly recommend!
5	Dr. Berman is a living treasure right here in Pittsburgh.  I could spend all day trying to describe how wonderful he is at what he does. He has figured things out with my body that mystified medical doctors and physical therapists. In addition to his chiropractic skills, he has incredible intuition about the human body, which enables him to accurately diagnose and treat.  If you need a chiropractor, don't waste time and money going to anyone else. Dr. Berman is the chiropractor you want and need.
