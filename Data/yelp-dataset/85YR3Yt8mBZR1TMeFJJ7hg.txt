1	I received by far the WORST haircut I have ever gotten in my life.We got some coupons from their grand opening, but a $6 haircut just isn't worth it if you get scalped.My son just wanted his hair buzzed, and they managed to mess that up too somehow. He required a re-do with my clippers at home.We will not be going back.
3	The place was fine, esp for the price. They welcomed my 5yo daughter, and gave her a decent cut (bob) in a reasonable amount of time. Chrissy was our stylist.
4	I took my 18 month old son here for his first haircut. The stylist, Christine, did a good job and handled my son well. We will be going back here again for the next cut.
