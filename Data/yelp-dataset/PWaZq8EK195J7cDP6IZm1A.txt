5	Amida is incredible at what she does. I have always considered getting eyelash extensions but had a lot of questions. Amida answered all of them and made sure that I was very informed before getting them done. She takes great care and uses really high-quality products. My lashes look amazing and most importantly, they look real. I never had lashes before and felt like I always had to find the perfect mascara to create the illusion that I had them. There is something so great about not having to worry about applying mascara and knowing that when you wake up in the morning you're going to still look amazing. Eyelashes really can make a difference. At least for me. I highly recommend Lash It Up and Amida. She will make you feel comfortable and you will leave looking beautiful.
5	I come here every two weeks to get my lash extensions, I get my hair done here, eyebrows, you name it! I wouldn't go anywhere else. Great service, convenient location, and best of all low prices! The Lash It Up team is talented and experienced. Thank you for making it easy.
5	Great lashes!
5	I've personally watched the attention to detail that "Lash It Up" carefully incorporates into each lash job they perform. I have watched the training videos that "Lash It Up" will be utilizing to certify her graduates. Again impeccable! Everything. From Amida's selection in products, to her concern for Hygiene, to the longevity of the lash job that each women will experience. Its an industry that will be here for a very long time to come. I believe that Amida has emerged to lead this industry to create a path of professionalism that can be duplicated through her certification program.She knows what to do and why. She knows what Not to do and why. She set new a standard! And this discipline and high standard will be passed on to her graduates and create a culture. Beautiful Lashes. Isn't it what every women wants!
