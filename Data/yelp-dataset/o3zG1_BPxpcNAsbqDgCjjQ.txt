5	This Chick-Fil-A just opened on May 30 2013. I have found the service and quality of food to be excellent just like every Chick-Fil-A I visit. The employees here are very friendly and polite. The service is fast and efficient. The food tastes good. The place is sparkling clean. If you are looking for fast food in the Blakney area, this Chick-Fil-A would be the top pick in my opinion.
5	We didn't go inside, just drove through before heading to Elevation Church across the street, but this location looked huge inside! Drive through was speedy and the employee helping us was, as always, freakishly friendly and happy.

4	We just had Breakfast!!! It was pretty good!!!This is a new location and it seems where ever they open a new location they do well! I would recommend breakfast over Mcdonalds any day! I believe this is long enough to be posted!
