5	Best service, best return policy, best selection and prices in the area. After purchasing my first and then second vocal processor and being dissatisfied with the products, Pianos N' Stuff glad returned each of them. I am now a satisfied owner of a Digitech processor which would not have been possible with out the knowledge and consideration of store staff. Highly recommend this store to all area musicians. It's worth the drive!
5	Very helpful and friendly staff.  Prices are unbeatable.  I rented 4 overhead mikes for a mere $42.00 for 4 days including a mixing board!!  Wouldn't hesitate to rent from here again.  Rental process was very straightforward.
4	This was one of the best music stores that I've visited in Pittsburgh. Though not the best in Pennsylvania it had a pretty good variety of instruments and the prices weren't insane either! They had a used section that was full of guitars, amps, keyboards, and other instruments to tickle your fancy. I was particularly interested in the keyboards and ukuleles and was very pleased! If you're a guitar fanatic you'll definitely love it here. The service was very helpful and really friendly as well.
5	I have been a customer at this music store not only for gear since I started playing drums, but also for 5 years of drum lessons. They have great staff who are all very knowledgeable about the gear they sell and I have yet to find better prices in any other music store. They treat customers like friends but they don't try to "sell" you things the way the big corporate stores do. If you need any kind of music gear, but it at N' Stuff Music.
5	Best place in town for all your keys/synths needs. Ask for Tony or anyone really , everyone is very helpful
