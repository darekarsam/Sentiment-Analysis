1	Don't even....NO!  Words cannot really describe the lunch buffet.  The parking lot is empty for reason...enough said!
5	I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The food is amazing, take out or buffet. The waitress is very nice, and she knows my preferences. Try the seam chicken and lo mein, they're cooked just how I like it. The price is affordable, and your getting your money's worth. The restaurant is a little hard to find, it's a tiny little place. The parking lot is empty because there are mostly call-in orders.
4	Nice little restaurant. Nothing fancy or incredible but consistently good food and friendly service. Also generous portions  Don't let the outside of the building fool you. The pork dumplings and chickens steamers are very good.
4	I have no idea why we've never been there before, but we tried them out for dinner on a whim last night, and really enjoyed the food!  The veggies were fresh and crunchy, the shrimp and scallops in our Happy Family were perfectly cooked, and the crab rangoon and plum sauce tasted homemade.  The prices are great, too!  Now we know that we have good Chinese within walking distance of our house, we'll be back often.
4	Buffet isn't that great, but the take out is awesome.  I highly recommended for take out.
2	This place needs some cleaning!!!!!! We tried it because of the great reviews , the buffet was gross, the hibachi chicken was not bad, but just eating it in that dirty place wasn't pleasant.
1	This place is a rundown shack. The buffet had no food. 3 pieces of fries. 2 broccolis. It was pretty much empty. We left because it was a joke. Just awful ..
