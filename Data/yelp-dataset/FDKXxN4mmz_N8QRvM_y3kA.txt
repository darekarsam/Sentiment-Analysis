5	Rarely can you find this caliber of coaching. Tony and April (the owners) keep a close watch on each members' body mechanics while lifting to minimize the risk of injury and increase optimal performance. The programming is appropriately designed with their audience in mind and modifications are provided for each movement so that everyone can participate regardless of athletic background.  Tony and April are receptive to gym members input and encouraging of each persons personal goals.  I highly recommend this gym, whether you are an experienced Crossfitter or new to working out.
5	Truly the best Crossfit box in the area. Tony and April, the owners, are friendly, knowledgable, and driven. I have crossfitted at other boxes in the area previously, and hands down, Alpha Athletics is best experience I've had.If you are new or experienced to Crossfit, give this place a try.
5	Like other reviewers, I have done Crossfit at other area boxes and left due to lack of heat in the winter, poor coaching or "cool cliques". Tony is detail oriented - you will squat perfectly before you squat heavy. Charting your progress is of tantamount importance. Members are required to introduce themselves to newbies, lest burpees be handed down from on high. This fosters a sense of community in the box. Meatheads, look elsewhere.
5	The owners and trainers here are second-to-none. As a small community focused gym they have done an excellent job of instilling an atmosphere of well-being and camaraderie. The coaches, Tony, April, and DP, are incredibly knowledgable when it comes to form, technique, and motivation. I've been attending for a year now and can see a huge difference in my ability and form. I highly recommend anyone looking to get healthier to try out the free Saturday class at 10 am. Keep up the great work Alpha Athletics!
