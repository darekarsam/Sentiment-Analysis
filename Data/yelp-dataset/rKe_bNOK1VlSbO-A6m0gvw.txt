2	I hit this place up since this place was a local spot and I always wanted to see if it was one of those "hole in the wall" type of places. Yes, it was a "hole in the wall" type of place, but no the food wasn't amazing. I ordered 2 of the 8 piece wing dinner, and well to me it just wasn't spectacular. The wings came out wings, but lacked any sort of taste in it. I honestly don't know what the hype was? I guess it was cheap. It came with 4 rolls, but they only gave us 3. Anyways, this place is marked and done. I won't be coming back here anytime soon. You'll have better luck at Church's Chicken or Bojangles with better chicken compared to this place. However, this place does have burgers and other menu items. But, come on... Chicken King restaurant, and you're not going to try the fried chicken that they named the restaurant after?
1	I stood waiting behind another customer and watched a roach climb along the pass through that connects the kitchen to the ordering area.No thanks. You can cancel my order.2013 #181 / 365
5	Great food and great service.   Very clean, health rating 97.  Can't beat the prices.  Bets Rubin and the fired chicken is cooked fresh so it is hot and crispy!     The only complaint is too much food.
