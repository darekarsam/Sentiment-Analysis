5	Outstanding.  All services performed on premise by an owner/operator.  They have the best services and prices in town.
5	Owner operated...America's Cleaners is my go to spot for dry cleaning.  I have some weird senses and one of them is the smell of certain things like the pavement after it rains, the scent of matches after it's been lit, and the smell of walking into a dry cleaners.  If you think I have issues, think again.  Who doesn't love the smell of fresh clothing?My normal spot for dry cleaning was located about 20 minutes south and with the increase of gas prices, I knew that I had to make a change to somewhere close by.  America's Cleaners fit the mold and does the job right.  Prices here are about average.  About $3 for a shirt/pants, $7 for your jerseys, and $30 for your comforters.  I don't dry clean every weekly, but will spoil my bedding, jerseys, pants, and curtains every once in awhile.  Service here is always great, quick, and I have never had an issue.  TIP: $.75 additional charge for credit card transactions under $10.
1	I've actually dealt with the owner and he sure was arrogant about his business when you ask him about the prices. Over priced and he tells you to go somewhere else for there are others who would pay the price. We'll guess what, it only takes one person to be insulted and starts the news.
5	I tried this place and they did a Great Job, but there was a drycleaner next to my work and took my drycleaning there for convienece, WOW will never go back there again, CRAPPY JOB, lint all over my clothes, it's the CLEANERS in the parking lot of Smiths at Losee and Centennial.  So went back to AMERICAN CLEANERS, though its a little farther drive, but so worth it, they rememeber your name and where you work and and what was the last conversation you had with them the last visit and always very friendly, and the DRY CLEANING service is GREAT.
