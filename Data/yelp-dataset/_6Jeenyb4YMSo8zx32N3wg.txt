5	Vegas Henna is wonderful to work with. Excellent artistic skill, lovely personality, flexible scheduling and a fair price! I hosted a bridal henna party at my home - was so easy working with Vegas Henna and we were all very happy with our designs.
5	My family and friends have been fortunate enough to get henna from Melissa of Vegas Henna.  Whenever we come through or visit Vegas we call Melissa.  She is artistic, professional, fun and uses quality products.  I have had at least 4 henna tattoos from her and have always been complimented on them and I myself very pleased with them.  Cannot wait to see her again!
5	First met Melissa about 3 years ago.  My sister found her and she was able to come to our hotel and take care of the 3 of us.  Have seen Melissa several times since.  I get more compliments from her work than anyone else when I am back home.  Her technique allows my design to last almost two weeks.  I give her the choice of what she will do and I love that it is all free hand.  Can not wait to be in Vegas in September and hopefully we will see Melissa again.
5	Another awesome henna design from Vegas Henna at the Las Vegas Belly Dance Intensive!  I have never been disappointed with her work.  I like to just give her a price point and let her do what she wants to my hand.  If you're around where she's vending (Streeats, First Friday, etc.) give her a try.
