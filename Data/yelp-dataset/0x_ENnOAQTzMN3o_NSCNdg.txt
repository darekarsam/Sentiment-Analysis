5	Yolanda is not only one of the best makeup artists in the valley but she does beautiful eyelash extensions. She did my makeup and lashes for my wedding and all night I kept getting so many compliments. I not only looked beautiful but felt beautiful too! I will recommend Yolanda to everyone!!! Go to her!!!
5	Yolanda is amazing! Very professional and easy to talk to. It was my first time getting lash extensions and she told me I would love them, and she was right! Since I've gotten them, I feel great. I haven't had any problems with them whatsoever! If you're on the fence about going to her, I'd advise you to jump! She's great at what she does, and you'd be downright silly if you choose otherwise!
