5	I purchased a mattress in July of 2013 for my 7 yr old and she loves it.  We just went back and purchased two more mattresses for our guest room and the salespeople, Marnin and Kevin, were very helpful and accommodating.  The delivery was fast and they worked with me when I decided right after delivery that one of the mattresses was not to my liking.  I would definitely recommend this store, Marnin and Kevin.
5	Highly Recommend this Store Kevin and Ken were wonderful ! Delivery people werevery nice. I cant say enough about the tempurpedic mattress dont believe the negative reviews. I am a disabled vet and my wife is also disabled this bed is a incredible piece of heaven ! So once again thank you Kevin for helping a veteran on veterans day!  Mike W
