5	I was with verizon for quite a while and their prices just kept getting up. I knew I needed a provider with better customer service and prices. I came to this t-mobile location and I was greeted instantly. There were 2 people on staff and I had the ultimate pleasure of being with Melvin. He was extremely helpful and accommodated to my needs. I was in the store for less than an hour and I ended up with an iphone 5s with all my contacts transferred and a great plan. He truly took care of me and kept my finances in mind. If you need a quick change of plan definitely go to Melvin!
1	Do not trust T-Mobile! Their salespeople and Corporate support have lied to me about my initial signal strength and lied about a tower that was coming to my area just to get me past the buyers remorse period. No integrity at all as recently demonstrated by the overbilling scandal uncovered by the FTC.
1	Waited for 45 minutes only to have someone walk in the door and cut in front of us and two other people. After telling the service representative he did not seem to care and continued to help said customer. After informing the manager of our situation we still didn't receive any assistance. Thank goodness this will be the only time we have to come to this sprint store. Avoid at all costs if possible. The employees they had on the floor was completely inadequate obviously. Upon leaving we didn't even get anything accomplished except being told to go to the corporate store 15 minutes away.
