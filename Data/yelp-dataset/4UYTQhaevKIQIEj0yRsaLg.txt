5	Ah-friggin-mazing. The only place I will buy milk from ever again. And the flavors?? TO DIE FOR. Never had such yummy chocolate milk, and the Arizona orange! YUM! I think I'm in a milk coma.
4	Fresh milk in glass bottles just like when I was a kid, you gotta love it! I tried some of the flavored milks and they were all good, they even have root beer flavored milk. I bought some 2% and it's really good fresh local milk.  They charge a $2 refundable deposit on the bottles
4	The flavored milks here are really good. The root beer one tastes like a root beer freeze and the Arizona orange is really awesome. Orange milk? Yeah! It's creamy, it's orange, and it's delish!! They will give you a free sample of whatever flavored milks you want to try, if your in the area I highly recommend trying them!
5	They were super nice. A very cute storefront and the milk was very cold in the fridge. We got chocolate and egg nog. The chocolate was very tasty and I am already totally obsessed with this egg nog!! Quite possibly the best egg nog I've ever had!
