5	As a real estate investor from Canada, David and the whole team made the whole process very easy. I bought  and sold my investment properties through them. They were easily accessible and ready to help whenever I had a question.  I would highly recommend them!
5	Service was outstanding! I thought buying from out of state would be difficult at best, but Tiffany Harris made the entire process easy and seamless. And the David Brownell Team continued with their great service even after the purchase. This company goes above and beyond what you'd expect from a realtor. Not only would I highly recommend them, I will absolutely use them again.
