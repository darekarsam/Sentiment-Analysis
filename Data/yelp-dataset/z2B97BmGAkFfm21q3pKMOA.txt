5	Dr Turner Leila is amazing. Very kind, professional and personable. Love her. The best ND in town and a great human being. I had a difficult condition and she could heal me! I am so grateful.
1	I'm writing as a past rep. Som w Designs for health back then. Brought in chipotle. Gave u like $300 in chipotle gift cards. Followed up like any rep would and was treated like crap!  Well, reps are people too!!!! Just wanted to let u know I didn't appreciate how badly I was treated! Especially by the female staff!!! I was TOO nice Bc I wanted your business BUT I don't want anyone's business badly enough to get crapped on, so I left u all alone. BE KIND TO PEOPLE!!! Please
