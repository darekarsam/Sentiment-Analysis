4	Your #1 stop for everything sports. They have almost every sports jersey and novelty item you can every think of all in one place. They have choices for every teams even crappy team like my Vikings right now :( There is not that many places around to find this much sports stuff all in one place.
1	Terrible customer service. Called to check on an item,  guy who answered the phone was rude.  He handed the phone to another guy who sounded like he just smoked 10 joints. I spend a lot of money on nfl gear but service is important to me and I will never spend a penny here. I just spent $600 on nfl.com I hope the owner of just sports reads this.
1	The sales staff did not say hi, greet me, or offer to help. And the rudeness turned up to level 12 when I started looking at u of a stuff.   DO NOT patronize this store as it is not worth giving your money to them. My school preferences of UA should not lead to a lack of customer service.....
