3	This is pretty good but not the best hot pot in the city. Hot pots are all about the broth and flavors. Most times the broths here are very basic and not full of flavor like others Ive had. They also dont have much variety with food. I like the idea of going to pick out your own food, but there isnt much to choose from and what's there isnt labelled so you have no idea what you may or may not want. Ive been here twice and left satisfied, but Id recommend little sheep in chinatown over this any day.
