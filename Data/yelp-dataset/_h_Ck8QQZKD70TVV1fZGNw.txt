5	This guy  is a master with the smoker/barbeque!  I dont know  how he does it, but everything is delicious, and the meat is as moist and tender as it gets!  I had the ribs , his briskette, and his chicken, and all were incredible.    I thought I could slow cook and smoke, but I am humbled by Rags cooking!
