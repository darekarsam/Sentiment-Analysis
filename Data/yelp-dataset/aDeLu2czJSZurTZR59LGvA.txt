5	Fast, clean, professional and easy parking. I had a great experience shipping an item back from a trade show at this location.
5	Had to notarize and ship some documents, with a fair amount of complexity involved. They were very fast, courteous, and knew exactly what to do. Fast and pleasant transaction.
1	Ridiculous. UPS account holders are refused service because, wait for it, "this is Vegas". There could be fraud. Real reason: the little stores don't make very much when you ship on your own account. They want the mark up even though my package was all ready to go. The main Ups center is near the car rental return and you can use your corporate account. These little ups stores are not ups and they do not do much for tge brand
5	Excellent service on Friday, October 24. I had to send packages back to Chicago. The clerk,  Anthony, was extremely helpful, professional and did a great job of taping up three individual packages. I will definitely use this store again if needed.
