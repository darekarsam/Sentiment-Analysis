5	This is a brand new location open just a few days. I've eaten at other locations over the years. All good experiences. The staff is always very friendly and courteous. Very welcoming! I love the seafood platter, the flounder and shrimp are always cooked perfectly. This new location carry on the goodness. Tonight I got the pita burger. Sooo very delicious!! Puts regular burgers to absolute Shame I tell ya! Every time I crave a burger it will be Showmar's pita burger over all the rest. So glad to have this new location in my neighborhood!!
2	Far below East Blvd Showmars in Charlotte. We have not bothered going back. Fries pasty, fish fishy, gyro dry.
5	I believe this is the best location in Charlotte.  The place is new, clean, courteous, efficient and well in a great location.  The other locations can take lessons.  Especially the one on E. 7th Street they need to tear it down and start over. ; in that order
5	I'm overall happy with this place. Customer service was on point. They get to you fast and neat. Came back and check on us a couple of times. I alway get the gyros when I go to Showmars.. And they never fails. So happy they now open one near my home!!!
1	food is good, but check your order. I ordered cactus chilli and broccoli cheese soup, and I got 2 broccoli cheese soups. also ordered a salad and only got spoons in my bag and no pita...  :/ I rated it so low because when I pay 20 something bucks for take out I expect it to be right. to late to drive back up.
