5	They have about 21 different kinds of burritos here, to include breakfast ones. It is a small and simple place, but the burritos are delicious. Best of all, the tortillas are hand made and fresh. If your looking for a quick snack but something different than the usual "Bertos" place around Phoenix, I recommend this place highly.
4	Excellent food for such a small place.  Fresh tortillas made here daily.  Outstanding
4	Recommended to me by a Mexican client. Tortillas made on site, nopales available, and lengua is their top seller. About as authentic as it gets. Owner is from Ciudad Juarez and food reflects that region. I enjoyed a divide rent style of Mexican and will be returning!
5	They had me at fresh "handmade"flour tortillas... Sad to say that you rarely find it in the valley...corn yes, flour no...Glad I won't be having to go to Texas for some authentic Juarez burritos... I had the lengua burrito:it's on the spicy side but it's so good Hubby had Picadillo Daughter had the chorizo and egg All amazing!Huge portions at great prices. Can't wait to go back and try something different
4	Very authentic delicious Mexican food, flour tortillas from scratch always extra points and the staff was polite and friendly even encouraged me to order in even though they were 10 mins from closing! I opted to take out still the shredded beef with green sauce was delicious I will definitely be coming back!
