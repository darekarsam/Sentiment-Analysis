4	This place seems to me to be Stockbridge's answer to Marchmont's Peter Green's. I say this because I saw pretty much exactly the same stock in here as in Peter Green's. Except that Peter Green's is larger and the men are more charming. No offense meant. Prices are also about the same as Peter Green's. They have a healthy (and by healthy I mean unhealthy) selection of ales and wines. Which is pretty much the only reason I'd go in there. Ales. And wines. Especially ales. It's a very cozy little shop, with everything beautifully displayed. Very organized. Possibly even a bit too organized for my taste. Though I'm already getting over it. And the staff are always willing to help (I seem to think most staff are willing to help, but maybe I just know how to approach them). Definitely get yourself to this shop if you're in the area and treat yourself to some boozy goodies.
