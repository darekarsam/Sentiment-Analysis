5	Fresh fudge made daily. Delicious ice cream, and amazing candied apples.  I'm certain I need not say more.Make a stop here, but don't tell the cashier he looks like the hulk picture behind him. It gets him mad. You won't like him when he's mad...
5	There aren't many things better than a really well made piece of fudge & The Fudgery has the formula down pat Soft, fresh fudge w/ lots of fillings.....YES, fillings! Over the course of 3 days, coworkers & I tasted the following...Maple - w/ maple syrup & pecans - like any good Southern treat. This was mapley, nutty & delish. Guy there told us he had just finished making it so it was ultra fresh & soft! Chocolate & Peanut Butter - this was my fav of the lot. This thing had REAL PB glopped throughout.....no measly PB mixed into the mix ... no-sir-ie-bob. The chocolate was rich & oh-so chocolaty & w/ the gloopy bloops of PB, it was the ultimate in decadence! ( which is just up my alley ) Chocolate & Caramel. Least fav - was a bit crunchy / crusty & I'm not a fan of crumbly fudgeMake sure to get those that are freshly made - they'll stay soft for at least a couple days & if you're like me, soft & creamy is the *only* way to have fudge!
