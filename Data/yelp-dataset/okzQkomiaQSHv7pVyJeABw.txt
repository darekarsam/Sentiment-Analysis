5	Lived here for past 5 months. This is the BEST kept secret in Phoenix. Very quiet, safe, clean, upscale apartment. Every unit is brand new. Amenities are great with heated pool, very nice fitness room, yoga studio and plenty of common areas for social gatherings. The management is converting all units to condos. If I were staying long term I would definitely buy. Great location for nightlife and in walking distance to light rail and arts district.
5	While the units are beautiful & luxury living, during my visit as a potential buyer/investor when they were first being marketed, as a sensitive, I was  overcome by feelings from spirits who appeared to have passed away in this building.  Now, that the units have all been sold, I hope those spirits have crossed over.
