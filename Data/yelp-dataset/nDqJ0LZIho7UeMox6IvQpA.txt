4	Great service, always timely and a fun atmosphere.I love walking to this place during lunch to get my haircut, walking into a place that has some of the same charm it was supposed to have when it was built in 1929. I would recommend coming here, as you can get a cut and clean for under $20 without leaving downtown.
5	Stayed at the Wm Penn down the street for a wedding and needed a last minute haircut. Friendly, helpful, all around good cut!
4	Nice place, friendly service.  Haircut was $15, which is more than I pay in NYC but it was a good cut.  And fast, too!They have a shoe shine guy there as well.It's in the basement of an office building and the inside of the building is beautiful.
5	As one should be, I am very weary of trying a new barber. Of course they are all competent at cutting hair, but are they good? Will the hold an awkward conversation? Will they be open to doing the cut how you want? Many questions to be answered. I went down on my lunch break as a walk in and was scheduled for a cut within 30 minutes. YOU SHOULD CALL AND MAKE AN APPOINTMENT unless you are okay waiting a little while. My barber, Rich eased all of my worries about switching barbers and I cannot wait to go back. I have found my new barber.
5	Awesome haircut. Ron was really friendly and clearly knew what he was doing. This is the first place I tried since moving to the area and I will look no further. Cheap haircut, great quality, good conversation. Best haircut I've had in a long time (and the girlfriend agrees!). I'll definitely be going back.
1	Terrible! My father-in-law got a haircut there just today and the guy cut his eyelid! Didn't even apologize! Didn't offer free haircut! Awful service!!
1	I don't usually leave yelp reviews, let alone nasty ones, but I just got a godawful haircut from a godawful barber at this place. Ruined my day.
