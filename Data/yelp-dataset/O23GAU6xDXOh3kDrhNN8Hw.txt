5	I just had my first facial with Sally at Moments Salon and I had to run right home to write an amazing review. I had never had a facial before but with my wedding coming up in a few months I wanted to do something to help my skin look great for the big day. After reviewing Sally online and spotting many, many excellent reviews about her I decided to book an appointment. First, she is excellent with communication and got back with me right away--even taking the time to call when another client had cancelled to see if my time slot was still the best for me. During the appointment she was incredibly professional and very sweet, she made me feel like I had known her for years and had some nice tips to share. The room was super relaxing and she gave wonderful massages in addition to the European Facial I received. She has a gentle touch and while I was worried initially that my skin would be red, it looked flawless and not a touch of redness was to be found. I can't say enough nice things about her and I will be booking many more follow ups before the wedding day rolls around. Five stars and more!
