5	Delightful place. Delightful location. Delightful people. Lizzy and Trevor are colorful, engaging, and attentive - not only in their customer service but in the selection of their shop goods. I walked out with a bag full of goodies and gadgets that I've never seen elsewhere: Big red magic ball, iridescent bubble spinners, and sushi decor for my little man's Kindle.  The Willy Wonka of toys. Something for everyone. This place is a unicorn!
5	Kappa toys has everything you need to entertain kids and adults, from interesting foreign baubles to classic American books. I love their selection of wind-up toys, and all of the props and masks!
4	The Container Parks very own toy box.  Just look for the vibrant colorful storefront with a non martial arts mutant turtle towards the back.  The lively mix of nostalgic and inventive toys are perfect for wee tots like my 2 boys or the wee tot in you.  Retro action figures and Japanese doodads abound.  It's basically a veritable Pee Wee's playhouse in there.  The selection is innocent and wholesome.  I can imagine the legions of computer desk knick-knacks and paddy-whacks adorning the Zappos office from here.The selection is complete chaos in order.  Randomness in sections.  From toys for toes & kiddie tattoos to Mario Bro's & Dr. Who's.  You will be entertained browsing through the shop.  It's a very feel good toy store where you would actually want your kids to pick from.  I can't help but think of Harajuku clashed with hipster then exploded into bits and pieces and landed perfectly onto shelves and stacked neatly to become Kappa Toys toy store.No matter how thick or thin your wallet is you will find something special here.  Although some larger things may be a bit overpriced, there are even bins of interesting little quarter machine toys that you might remember from way back when quarter machines only costed a quarter.  Please take me back to my childhood?!  Impossible.  Well then take me to Kappa Toys instead!   :)
