5	I have been a customer of this location for some time and the food has always been great. The thing I want to mention here is how they handle things when something is wrong. Recently I went through the drive through and ordered two steakTostada salads, my mom's favorite,  when I got home I discovered that they had been made as chicken tostada salads, I called back and spoke with the Manager,Francisco, and he was very apologetic and took my name and told me to stop in whenever I wanted and he would buy my mother and I replacement salads at no charge.  A week went by and I went in and could not get over how pleasant The manager was and how he really cared that a mistake had been made and that he wanted to correct it.  this place is great and they really do care that their customers are Happy, something i think is valuable in this modern world.  I will continue to go here knowing that if a mistake is made i will be taken care of by a staff that makes me feel like I matter.

2	The food was not what you order. As my sister put it, "the tacos weren't tacos, they were soggy burritoes." Also bathrooms did not provide soap which worries me that staff may have not been washing their hands before working.-AWMRA
