5	On Monday our Air conditioning went out and we called Reddi Services.  It was one of the hottest days of the year that day.  Frank came out within an hour of my call and quickly identified that the thermostat needed to be replaced.  He was very friendly and informative.
5	Reddiservices is the best service company out there.  I took Mark's recommendation at the Phoenix office and had Pepe come out and replace my leaky water heater.  I got the best: service, price and warranty out there.Reddi also does septic cleaning, plumbing and AC.  I would recommend my friends to call ReddiServices
5	Our office has used Reddi Services a few times over the years (for completely different things) and every time PEPE MUNOZ fixes the problem in a timely manner.  I always ask Pepe what happened and he explains it in such a way that it makes sense, and it makes me appreciate what he does and what he has done for us that much more.  Thank you Pepe!!!
5	Gerard came to unclog my drain.  He was fantastic.  He figured out the deal with my old house.  Then told me what to do to avoid problems in the future.  The price was fair and no surprises.  Very professional.
5	Nothing worse than backed up septic tank with a house full of people on thanksgiving!  Ricky stayed late and got our system pumped and working. Great guy, great service, worth every penny.  Similar price to everyone else, but superior service
