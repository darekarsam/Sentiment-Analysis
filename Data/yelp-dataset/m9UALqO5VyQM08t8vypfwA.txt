5	The only thing I hate is paying for labor on a battery. They should throw that in. Everyone is great here.  I know as a man I should replace it myself but if you are buying something from somebody, then I expect great service.
1	So my husband takes our van here for an AC Tune up with a coupon for $19 for this service. He walks out with a $200 bill without even being told about any extra charges. Very dishonest and misleading advertisement. We have been to 3 other places the 10 years living here, including the car shop a mile away from Desert Car Care, and out of all those 3 places the most we have been charged was $80. The only reason we went to Desert Car Care was we wanted to try this new place out. We had a coupon and the reviews seemed great. Ya, worst experience ever. I understand the charge for freeon, I expected it, but we got this extra $95 charge and wasn't even told about it till the bill was ready to be paid. If we had known there was this hidden charge, my husband would have left and gone back to the other auto shop a mile away. He complained to a manager and he wouldn't do anything but give him a coupon for a free oil and wiper change. Well duh, do we really want to come back again!!  We live right by you and will tell all our friends and family and neighbors about your dishonesty. Maybe the other locations are better an honest, but not this one.
5	Had a flat tire this morning. And was literally freaking out. I could see a huge screw in the side of my tire ): unfortunately they could not repair it however they removed my bad tire and put my spare on for free and then drove my car to my work for me. I work within walking distance and was able to leave  my car there and they brought it to me. AWSOME SERVICE!!!! I was almost in tears when I got there as I just started a new job and did not want to be  and they totally turned my day around! I will recommend these guys to everyone.
