5	Sandy has a true understanding that every child is unique and so may be the way that they learn. Sandy will create a plan that is specific to your unique child's needs. The online program is terrific for the parent that may want to home school but, may lack the skills and expertise on their own.
5	iLearn does a fantastic job in assessing each child's strengths and weaknesses to provide an individualized learning program.  As the father of 3 young children it is great to see an organization that looks to fulfill the needs of each child that they teach.
5	ilearn offers both a learning center with individualized programs as well as augmentation to traditional schooling.  Their programs are broad and far-reaching and fill gaps for many students.
5	Our son had gone to several private schools.  While they were very prestigious schools, they were not the right fit for him.  He has been at iLearn for 3 years now.  It has been exciting to watch him progress from an average student, who was constantly frustrated, to a student who is now disappointed if he gets anything other than straight A's.  The personal attention and caring environment have been incredible for his scholastic growth.  We would highly recommend iLearn, and have numerous times.
