5	Real good! Real cheap! The dentist took his time to explain my treatment options. His staff is super nice and the office clean. I've been coming to him for over 9 years now and have had no problems so far. Highly recommended.
5	Dr. Crow is a pro! I was so scared! I was in so much pain. I tried to just deal with it. I tried to pray it away. I tried warm water with salt. Nope, I need a root canal. I was literally sweating.I swear it didn't hurt at all. Lol. What a chicken I was. Dr Crow was nice. Patient. He had a couple corny jokes but they helped.I'm actually in the waiting room with my son. I'm kinda laughing because I know Erhart he's thinking.
5	Dr. Crow did a front crown on me over 15 years ago, I still have it and I have been complimented by many other dentists and hygentists. I would highly recommend him for crowns. I'm so thankful, my smile is priceless!
