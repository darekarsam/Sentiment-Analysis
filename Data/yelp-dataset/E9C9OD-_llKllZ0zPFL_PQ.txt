5	Gary and the guys at Ideal Body did a fantastic job repainting my car after it was badly keyed at a Badger game. They had just moved to their new location in the old Thorstad dealership, but were ready to provide quick, quality work. They handled the insurance company with aplomb. Highly recommended.
5	I scrapped my car twice in the same day, and the guys here were amazing. Honest, quick, and quality work. Awesome, awesome place!
