5	I was fortunate to discover Alexis a year ago and have been a regular massage client ever since.  In addition to giving great massages, she has extensive knowledge and advice on the numerous aches and pains I get from over doing yardwork or just sitting in front of my computer too long.  I have gotten regular massages for 40+ years, and can categorically say that Alexis is the best....Jim
5	I love this place. I have been going to Alexis for about a year now for massage work because she is awesome! BEST massage I have ever had and that is saying a lot from me. She has had a fix or advice for everything I have ever asked her about and very knowledgeable about the body. I recommend her all the time!  I LOVE HER!
5	I was lucky to be referred to Urban Wellness when I was pregnant over a year ago. I had, and continue to have regular massage visits with Alexis. She is very knowledgeable about all things woman! It is wonderful to have someone who understands your body and knows how to help you on a regular basis. I look forward to my regular visits, and I always feel like my needs have been met after each visit!! I highly recommend the many services available at Urban Wellness!
5	I have seen Alexis twice for great therapeutic massage. I have a lot of neck/back/hip pain that she can target and she understands anatomy well.  I purchased 3 more for the coming year & look forward to my next visit. The hours & location are very convenient for me as well.
