4	I always hope and pray that I'll somehow walk in there and be immediately seen. Unfortunately that's never the case but I do take solace in that the line moves fast. I was introduced to Dee's 4 years ago and haven't gone anywhere else for my eyebrows since. It's not because it's $4 (used to be $3) but they genuinely do the best work in Montreal. They often try to upswell and blatantly ask people if they'd like their moustache or beard removed... Which makes it quite uncomfortable for everyone within an earshot and for the client for that matter but all and all I think this is one of Montreal's gems.
2	I've been to the new location in Laval. First impression of the place screamed industrial warehouse with numbered rooms and a creepy dentist type chair placed in the middle of the room. In no way did this place offer comfort as what a beauty parlor should be. I did like the pricing, $20 for a Brazilian? It's a steal compared to the usual $50 I pay back in Vancouver. Anyway I was a little surprised they didn't inspect to see if I needed any ingrown hairs to be tended to. Overall score is 2/5. Will not come back.
2	Yep. This is cheap $4 but the way they provide the service like raising chicken industry. Everybody s talking about them but the employees have to speed up ( because of the long line-up) and they don't really listen to your request. Also not even apply any lotion for my facial threading. It was itchy after that. About the eyebrows, they don't really know or care what you want . When i explained they said yes yes.. but then they just removed as much as fast as they can to get rid of you and then left your eyebrows to thin and ugly. I won't be back to these place especially the one in Laval, really looks like the dentist's room with the creepy chair. $4 is reasonable but i prefer a higher quality with a little bit extra price.
