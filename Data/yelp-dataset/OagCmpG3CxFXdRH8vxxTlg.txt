2	My slice of pizza was still slightly cold when served, and the toppings were not very generous. The cashier was also pretty rude.The food is pretty cheap however, they serve 6 kinds of pizza, poutine, and shish taouk.The dining area was very messy, no one cleans the table, and the table arrangements were very awkward.They only accept cash by the way.
5	My favorite small pizza place, especially for chicken pizza. I lived on Guy & de Maisonneuve so it was perfect to stop by for a fresh full chicken pizza for $7.50. When I did promotional contracts they would regularly swap our free stuff for food. The workers are nice and the food is good/quick for a decent price.
4	I LOVE THIS FUCKING PLACE.So cheap, so fast and so yummy yum yum!All of their prices are obviously there for students, they serve it quickly and it's cheap too! Friendly staff even though you can EASILY TELL English/French is not their main language.3.50$ for a poutine man! And they ACTUALLY melt the cheese so I'm not stuck with random bits of cold cheese curds.Removed a point because most do not wear hair nets aaaaaaand their arms are kind of hairy. I found a hair twice in my poutine :(.
5	As a student at Concordia, I would eat at Pizza Bella all the time and it's awesome! Quick, cheap yet really good, it is one of the best places to grab lunch between classes.
