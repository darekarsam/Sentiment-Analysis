3	How does this Boston Pizza differ from the others in Canada you ask?  They speak French here.  That's about it.   This chain has a location just about everywhere and sometimes when you need a BP fix, there's really no other place to go except BP.My favourite is the Boston Royal, or the Boston Brute.  Really can't go wrong.  I'm giving it three stars because of the average service and average atmosphere.  It's BP's though, so c'mon.  Stop being so hard on them!;)
2	I have never liked this place. I went for a birthday. I took nachos with a pitcher of sangria. $47. Really? The service was horribly slow, the food was nasty, there was no cheese on my nachos. I was NOT pleased. I never go here at my own will.
2	I like Boston Pizza, but this one let us down.Bland and overcooked, and  a long wait on a slow day does not make me happy.You guys need to get it together, and find the standards that we expect you to uphold.
3	I liked it. Came with my kids. All that i expected from a place like this. Good food.
