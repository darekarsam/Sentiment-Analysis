3	We decided to watch The Hobbit yesterday. We went here because it was in 3D, and in the original English version. I have to say that it was my first 3D movie experience, so I was looking forward to it.We got our tickets 2 hours before the movie started. There was no assigned seating, and since this movie was already showing for a bit, there weren't plenty of people wanting to see it. However, when we returned to the cinema after dinner, there were plenty of people lined up. We later learned that there were multiple movies that were starting at the same time, so there were crowds, but we did get good seats for our movie. The good thing about this theatre is that there are not many commercials. I think there were just 5 minutes worth of commercials, and the movie started promptly. The bad thing about it is that the 3D glasses hurt. They were hi-tech, there was a receiver in front of the glasses that will activate the 3D-ness if you're looking at the screen. However, my temples hurt, as they were hugging my head too much. Anyway, as a 3D movie virgin, I still enjoyed it. I just don't have other points of comparison, so I am rating this 3 stars or A-OK for now.
