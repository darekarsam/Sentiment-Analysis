4	Inexpensive, Quick Band-aid; I would stay here again.It's a Marriott, so I knew it would be okay.PROS: The only hotel *IN* the WaterfrontReasonable ratesVery friendly staff (both on the phone and my in-person experience)Was able to give me a room @ 1:30am during the 2010 Pgh BlizzardClean roomCONS:n/a, none that I could really think ofI had to call here @ 1:30am to make a last minute reservation because I was literally stuck in Homestead during the snow storm.  They gave me a great deal on a nice, warm room on a last minute basis.I couldn't have asked for more (except some pajamas! LOL).I will def utilize this hotel again if needed.
5	Great service, clean, fresh, on the river, reasonable price. Thank you Marriott for this lovely property!
4	This courtyard is on the newer side.  It is literally right on the river with lots of dining and shopping options close by.  The rooms were in good shape, decent size bathrooms and beds were comfortable.
4	I'm staying here for business and I am very grateful to Shawna at the front desk for helping my group when our flights were canceled by helping to look for transportation alternatives or book another night. My room was clean and comfortable.  There were 2 treadmills in the gym but no stationary bike. The pool was too small for laps but perfect for kids to splash around!
