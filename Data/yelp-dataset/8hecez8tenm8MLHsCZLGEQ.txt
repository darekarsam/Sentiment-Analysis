4	I've finally managed to decide that I want to not only purchase a handgun, I want to be able to carry it with me. North Carolina law requires that you visit the local Sheriff's office and fill out an application to purchase a handgun. Charlotte is a part of Mecklenburg County and so the Sheriff's Office is the place to go. There's a stack of clipboards. There are a stack of forms. It's not rocket science, people.At the moment, handgun purchase permits cost $5 per handgun but they take as much as 30 days or more to be processed. So you might want to pick up a few of these since they're valid for 5 years.And you'll have to come back later to submit the carry permit paperwork after taking your class.As long as there isn't some big event in town, it's not hard to find a parking meter somewhere nearby for $1/hour.
5	I've sent the past two months attending the sheriff's office citizens academy. I've learned an amazing amount of information about what their duties are and met the men and women that run our jails, process prisoners, serve papers, provide escorts for funerals and for public figures. It's a very interesting course of study and I highly recommend it to everyone. You can apply on the sheriff's office website.
4	If you're renewing your concealed carry permit, fill out the form, pay and set an appointment online no more than 90 days prior to its expiration date. Print (don't sign) and take the renewal packet with you to your appointment because basically they need to notarize the documents on-site and photocopy your ID.There are a number of release forms to sign for authorization for hospitals and providers to release information regarding physical capacity, mental health, mental capacity or substance abuse to the sheriff.I usually park at the lot on E 4th and Davidson for a dollar.
