5	This location: they take their time.  It's not wham-bam-thank you man like other joint locations. I like it
2	This place is alright. Nice Chiro very gentle so if your like me and like to hear the cracking of your back then don't expect it. It's $19 for first visit and $29 thereafter. I would suggest getting one of their packages because it would remain $19 that way. It's very convenient though. Just walk in scan your card and get adjusted which takes less than 5 minutes.  The guy before me spent 3 minutes! Geez! For $19 they should have a few of those massage chairs in the waiting area so you can loosen up before your adjustment.
5	I was a bit skeptical about this but I have to say I'm feeling much better. Don't wait for days in pain! Dr Jones was super friendly & funny. The receptionist was very nice & friendly! Nice job!
