4	After years of dealing with USPS in Chicago, Champaign is like a breath of fresh air.  I have been to the post office on Green a few times, and each visit has been a positive experience (well, as positive as mailing parcels can be).  The people at the counter have been able to help me and they have been very nice. My only gripe is that they could use more employees working the counter when it gets busy.
