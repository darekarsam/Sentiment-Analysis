5	I heard so many great things about this restaurant from my Korean friend and my boyfriend so we finally all decided to go and give it a try. I was definitely not disappointed. This Korean restaurant is humble and small but packs a punch. We ordered vegetarian pancakes which were so tender and delicious. We also ordered a kimchi pajeon which was also delicious. It was crispy and mildly spicy! For our main dishes we ordered jap chae, soondubu jigae, some sort of honey flavored grilled chicken, and bulgogi. All were fantastic. My tofu stew was amazing and the portion size was just right. The jap chae was the best jap chae I've ever tried in my life, it had a salty and sweetish taste to it! My boyfriend's honey chicken dish was absolutely amazing...it had a hint of sweetness but still had that grilled chicken taste to it. Not to strong at all. All the portion sizes I noticed were just right...some restaurants give too much or too little food. I found Dae Jang Kum to give appropriate portions like Kazu. Service was excellent and friendly. This place was definitely authentic and really not pricey at all. Expect to spend 20$/less on a decent meal. They also sold stainless steel chopsticks from Korea! And they sell delicious kimchi for 4.50$ (small) and around 6.50$ (large).  If only this place was in Montreal...I'd be a regular.
