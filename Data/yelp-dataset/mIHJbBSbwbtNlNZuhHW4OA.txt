5	Danielle is so talented in her field that I trust her with my whole families' hair needs! In fact, my husband used to never care about his hair and would just go to any stylist that would take walk ins. After using Danielle he agrees that he looks younger and like he has thicker hair.  It is so convenient to have my whole family go to Danielle, even my son!I am so glad she is our stylist and we would never go anywhere else!
5	If you want to look and feel amazing go see Danielle and salon c21. My hair has never looked better, fuller and all around healthier. In addition to this Danielle is the sweetest person, that makes getting your hair done so enjoyable.
5	Prior to seeing Danielle for a scheduled cut, color, and style, I had not received a haircut in two years. I used to consistently get my hair done every six weeks at Zolton's for 7 years. Yet, after those hair appointments at Zolton's, I always walked out completely unhappy with my hair. That is why I refused to get my hair done for so long! Thank goodness I stumbled upon the most hospitable and talented, miss Danielle Coleman! Her beautifully designed studio instantly put me at ease and made me feel comfortable. Not only did she have a wonderful, positive attitude (something I haven't experienced beforehand from previous hairstylists), but she drastically changed my hair for the better SO QUICKLY! I went into C21 to see Danielle Coleman for a hair appointment initially in an awful mood (due to work), and finally, for once, I walked out of her salon as the happiest woman! My hair looks far beyond better than it ever has before! In just one hair appointment,  Danielle's service and hospitality had impressed me so much, that I can finally get my hair done with excitement every six weeks, as every girl should. I DEFINITELY recommend Danielle Coleman all way the way! Truly talented with a beautiful spirit!
