1	Not really worth your time. They are not very experieced. They take customers for granted. They did not really fix my problem. Look them up on other review sites, you'll see the grand majority of people are displeased. save yourself some money and go somewhere else...
5	Excellent service!! Very good work and friendly staff!! I was in and out in a timely fashion and the staff is very experienced and educated on the products they sell and service. very happy !!
5	Most dealers won't service older bikes but these guys will work on bikes that nobody else will touch.  That can be tough considering manuals are pretty much non-existant and parts can be very hard to come by.  And that's the case with a couple of my bikes.  But they stand by their work and if their "best guess" doesn't work out they make it right.
3	Westys is out of buisness
