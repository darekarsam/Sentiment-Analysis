2	I must be getting old....just too loud and cramped in this place.  I agree with the previous post.
3	I almost feel embarrassed to be writing this review, but I did head to check this place out since folks went there after the show I was covering while I was out in P'burgh.  It's what you'd expect - a club for tourists and such.  So based on that, I'd say it was what you would expect from a place like that.  Lots of rooms of various types of music and cheap cover which was nice since I didn't really want to go in the first place...
3	Went there for $1 Drink Thursdays and it was okay.  Nothing to write home about but the drinks were cheap so that was cool but other than that, nothing else was special:  Venue, Crowd, Decor.....Cheap Drinks on Thursday.  But would I want to come here any other day....  Hmmmmm....
5	Im pretty sure this the place I was at when I met this girl, I had 20 bucks came home with 8 so the drinks is cheap. Batchroom was clean. Anyway this girl game me some disease. AND I LOVE IT!
1	They think that they are all that and a bag of grits.  Maybe instant watered down grits.
1	This place is disgusting on so many levels. First of all the music sucks. I think the DJ in the hip hop room is just playing B94. The DJ in the 80s room is playing an old 80s compilation CD and the guy in the "Techno" room isn't much better. No one in Pittsburgh seems to know what house music is so I suspect that room would always be empty whether he would be good or bad. And the women at this place? - mostly troll skanks - a - grizzled. And they obviously let anyone into this club because I've never seen so many portly and outright obese women. Although it is free to get int, you get what you pay for and I ended up leaving after 30 minutes to go to Brillobox where DJs were playing actual records and good music that wasn't straight from the radio.
