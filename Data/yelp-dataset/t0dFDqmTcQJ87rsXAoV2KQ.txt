2	Taste of China is the closest Chinese to my old flat in Bruntsfield, and is located on Gilmore Place, not far from the junction with Viewforth.  I've never really noticed it before as a Chinese, but with moving flat, I needed somewhere close for food, and so we gave this place a try.The food was alright for what I was looking for - just some food to satisfy hunger.  The other people that ate it with me were not raving about it as we - it was just a fairly unremarkable takeaway experience.  Certainly compared to other Chinese takeaways I've had in the city, it wasn't the best.In terms of customer service and friendliness of the staff, I can't really comment as I wasn't the one that bought the food.  But for a basic meal, it did the job.
