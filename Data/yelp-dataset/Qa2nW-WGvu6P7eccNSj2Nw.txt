4	This restaurant is the middle of the shopping center with the Giant Eagle in the South Side.Let me tell you, the enviroment is not a plus.  It's kind of like a fast food restaraunt atmosphere and it's not in the best area of town. I have eaten General Tso's chicken all over this country and it is the very best General Tso's EVER!  I order it extra spicy and it's amazing. I can't speak for the other food there, other than the egg rolls, rice and hot and sour soup are good too.  The General Tso's is so good though, I've never ordered anything else.
4	I ordered the Garlic Chicken and it was delicious, hot, fresh, flavorful and the chicken was tender. Large portions and inexpensive.
1	I was starving and between errands so stopped in for a quick chicken fried rice. Disgusting. There was zero flavor... I added three packs of soy sauce to make it taste like something. The chicken had a grayish color and no carrots, peas or egg. Only bean sprouts and onion, I ate about a quarter of it and pitched it. Never again. How hard is fried rice?
