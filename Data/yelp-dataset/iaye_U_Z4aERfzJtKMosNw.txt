4	So far, so good! The property I'm renting has been transferred between property management companies twice and it's now being managed by Real Estate by Design. Heather has been very on top of things, getting back to us quickly when we email or call her with questions. My favorite part: rent is payable online AND tenants can make maintenance requests online as well. No more driving all over to drop rent off or having to call for maintenance issues. Yay!
2	I'm currently renting with this company and my agent is Heather, and so far I am very disappointed. I have been already living in my new condo almost a month and I'm still waiting for things to be fixed. Heather has been rude to me most of the times I have called her to check the status on my work orders that have been taking forever and it seems like I am always irrupting her and bothering when I call her. The HOA office for Blackhorse condos is a joke as well, another rude company. After this I don't think I'll re-new my lease here.
2	Not very helpful property management company.  I would not recommend real estate by Design to friends.
1	I will never rent from this place again and I'm encouraging all of my family and friends to never step foot in the building! They take weeks for simple repairs. then they tell me they're coming and never came. i missed 2 full days of work for a simple repair because their handy man is so unreliable. they charge fees that were not mentioned during the signing of the lease and make you pay before you can cut your ties from these people. i would advise anyone to stay away from this place! there are plenty of other companies!
