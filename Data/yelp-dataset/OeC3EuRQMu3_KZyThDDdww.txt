1	WORST GYM EVER!! Tricks you into having to pay more and won't let you cancel your membership without paying outrageous fees. All employees are very rude! Go to Desert Fitness, same monthly cost and you get access to so much more!
4	Not sure what that guy's deal is, but I've never had any issue with 2 different locations of Anytime. The random times I go it is NEVER busy. Facility is usually in good shape. The machines and benches aren't soaked with sweat and other nasty goo like most box gyms are. I'm happy here: no crowds, juice-heads are a rarity, and I truly feel like I have the place to myself. It's totally worth the $30/month!
5	Great gym and friendly staff. No intimidation when working out and it has everything I need. I don't like the big gym atmosphere.
