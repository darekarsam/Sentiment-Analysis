4	Excellent job!!
1	All I wanted was for my car to be cleaned. First I get there and as one of the girls is vacuuming my cat she's looking at her phone. Second there's like 2 cars being cleaned, mines being the 3 and there's like 6 people. Lucky the older lady there was about the only one doing her job. She cleaned it and the girl who.from before was vacuuming my car starts to clean it again. Anyways I SPECIFICALLY asked for NO air fresheners. This guy comes up to my car and starts to spray air freshener. Ugh!! I was very frustrated and NEVER will I go there again. All because I didn't want to drive to my regular car wash
5	Second time here, and not a single problem.  They do a great job here!  Oh, and that 1 negative review is absolutely ridiculous.  Makes little to no sense.  These guys actually do an excellent job!
4	First time here and was going to use a Groupon for Francis & Sons only to find out they are now under a new name, Bethany Auto Spa. I was about to find another location but the check in attendant offered a VIP service at less cost. Since I was there I took the offer and I have to say the gentleman who serviced my car did an amazing job. My ride looks brand sparkling new. The inside of the wait area needs a bit updating but not too bad otherwise. No upsells either. Definitely will be back. My only regret was not getting my attendants name. Hopefully, they are all as good as him.
2	This is no longer Francis and Son's car wash. I walked into this place and tried to use my Groupon and the cashier told me it is no longer Francis and Sons anymore. I had to pay full price for my car wash. It would have been helpful for them to post new management signs outside so a customer can know what to expect.
