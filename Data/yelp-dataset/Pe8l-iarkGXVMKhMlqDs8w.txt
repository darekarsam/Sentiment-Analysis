1	These guys sold me a car a couple months ago.  Since then I've had to fix multiple oil leaks, buy a new radiator, replace the belt tensioner, get a new battery, and fix a tail light.  Today, my airbag warning light lit up. There you have it.
5	I started bringing our MINI Cooper here on the recommendation of a friend. This is the shop he trusts with his older BMW and now this is the shop that gives me straight answers and fair prices as opposed to the MINI dealership which I feel is overpriced and frankly not very straightforward. We have been coming here with our car for over two years and never had a problem with them. Their waiting room is basic and the neighborhood is industrial but there's a Coke machine, a friendly dog, and you aren't sitting there with a dozen strangers on their laptops like at some dealership garages. If you have an imported car, give them a spin.
