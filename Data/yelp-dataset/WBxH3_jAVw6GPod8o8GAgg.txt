1	My wife and I walked the streets searching for the best pub to watch a hockey game in (reportedly Le Pistol) and couldn't find it in the evening.We returned days later, with sunshine to aid our search.  We found the old sign box (pictured) and a building with sun bleached "Le Pistol" tattooed on its scaly wall - but no pub.There is now an Asian eatery where Pistol once stood.
