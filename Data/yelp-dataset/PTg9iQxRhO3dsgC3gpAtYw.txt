5	Let me be the first to say that this place is really freakin' good.  We've been here twice since it opened and the service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious.  Better than Charanda near Baxter village. Can't wait to eat there again! :)
1	Food quantities were nice service was nice but the food lacked flavor.... Salsa was bland, Rice was dry, beans no taste, my chimichanga had more onions and peppers than chicken... he thing I enjoyed most was the tea...I prefer Charanda near Baxter personally.
4	I had fried burritos covered in cheese with beans and rice. This. Meal was delicious. The staff was very courteous and nice. My daughter had a kids queseadea and I had a couple of bites best quesedea I've had in a long time. The chips  were a little bland but they are bottomless. The salsa was yummy. I definitely will be coming back.
