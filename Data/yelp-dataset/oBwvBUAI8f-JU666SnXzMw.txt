5	IT'S LIKE CHEERS UP IN HERE...WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME!I love playing bingo here because it's a smoke free bingo room. It's less crowded on the weekdays. $2 extra for a stationary electronic machine that has cable television! Bring your own earphones. The staff is always friendly. I used to come twice a week. They knew me by name and exactly what packs I wanted. I love it here!
5	After spending a long time as a regular at South Point bingo, I never thought I'd find love again in a bingo room.Until I met the Aliante.I love it. The all paper room is fantastic!!!! Not sure their reasoning behind it but it definitely helps to weed out the scum, and hooligans that get obliterated drunk then show up to bingo because the machines do all the work. For many other reasons as well, the all paper room is the reason I'll keep coming. Pricing is fair and the bonuses are fair in comparison, though they are lower than the amounts you would generally see at south point or the stations. Hey, I'll take the lower bonuses and cash balls if they stay all paper and at fair pricing. The bartenders/waitresses are always so so so friendly, a nice change of pace from the grumps at south point. Two free drinks when you play! The staff was very patient with me my first game. I explained to the lady that I was a regular at south point before and didn't know how their room and games and pricing worked. She introduced herself as the manager and walked me through everything without rushing me but also without treating me like an idiot. As this is a mostly "regulars" bingo room, I was pleased when the staff was still friendly and respectful when I was brand new playing here. Now that I am becoming more of a regular I still find them to be very friendly. Some more so than others. Keep it up Aliante Bingo!
