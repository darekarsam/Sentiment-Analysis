5	DR Stacy is the best !! she has taken care of my sons teeth since he was a little boy, he is in the army now and she still takes care of him . she is taking care of my daughter now , and she sometimes requires a lot of patients when she is getting worked on . all of the staff do a great job !!! she has moved a few times and we have went right along with her to all the new locations.
1	DO NOT GO HERE. I went to her as a child for orthodontics and it was such a horrible experience that my dad made her remove them. Then 8 years later i've had to have another set of braces due to her poor treatment! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!
5	Highly Recommend Dr. Stacey!!  Diane Stacey, DDS has been taking care of my 5 children's  teeth their whole lives. They are all Teenagers now. My kids have the most Beautiful Smiles! My kids love going to the Dentist, thanks to Dr. Stacey and her Wonderful staff!  She is the BEST!!
