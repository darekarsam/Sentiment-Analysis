5	MD's Cooling and Heating is an honest company, rare to find in this area.I had an AC issue that ended up resulting in flooding of my ceiling and walls. The initial company that came out was like an episode of "12 Call for Action" or something similar. Typical bait and switch, overdiagnosis, and tried to take advantage of me. Feeling overwhelmed, my real estate agent and friend pointed me to MD's and I'm glad they did. Gabriel came out the same day, and after spending some time in the attic, came down and told me what needed to be done. All simple fixes, no BS. He even came back to make sure everything was OK, and for some tweaks. Ended up costing a fraction of what the first jokers said I needed. This company is honest and up-front. If you need AC or heating work, feel confident that you won't be taken for a ride if you use MD's Cooling and Heating.
5	Dave from MD's came right over when I called about 8 p.m. because my A/C wasn't cooling down my house. He immediately identified the problem (low coolant), and solved it without trying to upsell me or waste any time. He was polite, friendly, and professional. I was so pleased that when he did mention MD's maintenance/inspection program, I signed up because the price is perfect if it continues to come with such great service.I definitely recommend MD's if you are looking for a smaller but reliable cooling and heating business.
5	I got excellent service with a great price. Miguel is a professional and a pleasure to do business with.
