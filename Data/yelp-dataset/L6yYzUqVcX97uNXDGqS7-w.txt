1	I never win. Except once... but the macine was broken. They took their money back. Now I'm sad. Thanks for reminding me.
4	This was a nice casino experience.  It wasn't as loud as Las Vegas.  The food was really greasy and made me a bit sick.  Admittedly, I chose to eat at the fast food place inside the casino, but ah well.  I still had a great time.  I don't really gamble, so I only came out $10 ahead, but it was still fun.
