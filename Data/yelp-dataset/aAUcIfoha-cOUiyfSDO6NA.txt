1	After waiting for over a year for this place to open I was excited to go. I wanted to like it, I really did... And perhaps with some edits we will be back...  Oy beer on tap was Old Mecklenburg Brewery (OMB). Need  more options need, much better options... Food was just ok, wanted a burger but they do t have fries... Really? Ordered the BLT that was nothing special.   Fix the beer menu and the food, maybe you will get more folks in.
3	First off, I was trying to decide between 2 and 3 stars- and chose 3 because our food did taste good but...We went in on a Friday night and it was pretty quiet.  All the appetizers tasted great- especially the Buffalo Chicken nachos!  Not a huge menu but it worked.  On to the main event. I ordered a ultimate Bacon Burger- which was a patty half the size at any other restaurant and a single piece of bacon cut in half.  :(. My side was the mashed cauliflower and the burger tasted great and fresh, but was seriously the smallest thing I've ever seen, for $10.  Smaller than a kids burger!Since it was our first visit, not sure if this is the norm.  I liked the actual bar but I'm not paying $10 for half a burger.
5	This place is great.  The owner, Curtis is very friendly. Nice laid back pub with freshly made burgers and healthy fresh food options.   I had a salad and it was awesome.  No iceberg  lettuce.  Serves wine from RagApple Lassie supporting a local vinyard.   Old Mecklenburg on tap.
