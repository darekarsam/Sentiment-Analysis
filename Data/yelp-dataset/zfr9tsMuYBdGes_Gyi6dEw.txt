4	I was pleasantly surprised by this little salon in Cave Creek.  I took my daughter there to correct a bob gone bad and Kim did a wonderful job.  The salon is small but I think that is what gives it its charm.  It's the type of salon where you get to know your stylist well and they get to know you!  I was so impressed by Kim's precision cutting that I will make my own appointment with her.  One very cool feature of this salon was the Color Bar.  It reminded me of a salon in NYC that I use to frequent.  All in all, it's a small space but it has some great artists there.  Check it out.
5	Simply the best cuts and styles in town! I have been going to the salon for years and have had many hair styles along the way. Both Kim and Michelle can work wonders with hair!!
5	After being a client at a studio (c) in sundial plaza and paying a ridiculous amount ($500) for the standard cut and color I decided to try salon chella. So happy that I did. Not only was the price 1/4 of the cost at the other salon, the result was 10 times better!  Go see Kim.
