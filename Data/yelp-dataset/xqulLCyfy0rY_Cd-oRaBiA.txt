3	I always thought there was something a touch conservative about Brora and when I ventured in recently, my suspicions were confirmed. There was a group of yummy mummies shopping for new outfits and a couple of Samantha Cameron lookalikes trying on new dresses. To add insult to injury, Brora's prices are steep and their spring and summer collection seems to fall somewhere between M&S and Monsoon. We're talking Liberty print dresses, pinstripe pencil skirts, embroidered smock dresses, striped boleros, lambswool waistcoats and V neck cardigans. Whilst there's plenty of ladies that appreciate this style of fashion, I'm not one of them.
4	So, Brora. I know it's quite straight laced and a tad more expensive than a lot of places on the high street, but its high quality knits justify the price tag.Their V neck sweaters and floral print blouses aren't racy, but they're not staid or sensible either. Their ladies range is tasteful while also adding a touch of flair with lace trimmings, and contemporary while maintaining a level of sophistication.They have some cute, quaint kids stuff and some knitted cardi's for the guys. Overall I would say that the store specialises in grown up fashions that are wholesome without being boring. Their dresses and jumpers could be dressed up with various accessories, but their clothing ranges seem appropriate for all occasions. They keep their styles fresh but their garments are geared towards a cool and mature audience.
