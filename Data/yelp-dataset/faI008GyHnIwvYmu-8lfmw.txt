5	Majestic Cabinets refinished the cabinets in my entire house. They did an amazing job and the price was very reasonable as well. They were flexible as well when I changed my mind on color in the kitchen. They also have several other references that you can call that all recommend this company!!!!!
4	Outstanding company to partner with!  Very professional, very responsive, and very technically equipped.  Quick at addressing the customer's concerns and/or needs.  Would have given 5 star rating, however installation was delayed a bit, at their request.  Also, (outside of the installation itself), more on site work performed than normally would have preferred.      Final product was a beautiful maple custom home entertainment center, designed exactly to our requirements at a very reasonable price.Would definitely recommend!!!
