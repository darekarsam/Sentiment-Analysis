5	I normally get really anxious going to the Dentist but as soon as I get there the whole staff is sooo nice that I feel better! They are so caring and the atmosphere is so happy and calm that it puts me at ease. I highly suggest going here if you are nervous like me!
5	I try to stay away from the dentist because it is a scary thing for me. However, the treatment I received at this office is just outstanding. From the nice receptionist all the way up to the doctor I got nothing but friendly and courteous services and at the end of my appointment they gave me a little present to take home. The treated me like fimily.
