5	You are never too old for VANS! Cant wait to show my GF my new shoes (she is going to kill me)
3	Cool shoes and colors!
5	I'm in this Vans store and many others throughout the country more than I'd like to admit with 33 pairs and counting.  It has gotten so bad that the other day I came home with some new shoes only to realize I already had the same style at home.  I also like the custom shoe options available online where you can customize nearly every panel and part of the shoe.  Service is consistently good and their selection is quite vast.  On one occasion a pair that I hard worn for about a month became an annoyance in the right foot so I took them back.  Misha was happy to exchange them for another pair without any hassle at all.  That's the first time I had considered taking a pair of shoes back but figured it was worth asking since I was going there anyway.  5 easy stars for good selection, value and service.
