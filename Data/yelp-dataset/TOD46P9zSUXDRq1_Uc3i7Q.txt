4	I've found a new default place to stay when in town. This hotel was built in 2009 and the rooms are large and clean (and new). Frosted glass separates the bed area from the work area which includes a desk and couch. It has a real shower (not a bath tub ... who uses those in a hotel?). Even the toilet has its own room with sink.
5	I played music at the First Annual Arts Night at SpringHill Suites. I was set up in the lobby and was able to watch as people entered the hotel. What really struck me was the staff called many of the hotel guests by name as they walked in. I was impressed by the facility - the lobby is spacious, attractive and very clean. They have a bar that was open (on a Tuesday.) A pool and fitness room are available. This hotel is perfect for the business traveler as well as the leisure traveler as it is easily accessible from all of South Charlotte. In addition, there is ample space for meetings. I would recommend to anyone traveling to Charlotte to stay at SpringHill Suites. SpringHill (a Marriott brand) has made a corporate commitment to support local art which to me, says a lot about who they are as a company.
4	Rooms were amazing.  Breakfast was disappointing.
4	Nice hotel with comfortable rooms. The only difficult part is learning the roads to get in and out - they are a little confusing.
4	My stay at the hotel was excellent. The staff was friendly, the rooms were great, and the location was just what I needed. All around though, it was a good stay at a classy hotel.
