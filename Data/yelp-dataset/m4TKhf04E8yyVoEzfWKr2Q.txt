4	A nice new business in the area. They have nice breads and "viennoiseries" and is a nice place to enjoy a coffee. The bread is not cooked here but comes from an artisan on the sought shore. I did enjoy particularly the "baguette" which was crisps on the outside and soft inside. Very rarely "baguettes" are that good.
5	Cute little French bakery in the heart of the Atwater Market/hipster restos/shops and the Corona Theatre area. The baguettes are excellent;crunchy crust,firm bread on the interior. I went there early Saturday afternoon,and already there wasn't much bread left; the small resto area was quite well occupied (4 mid-sized rustic tables) and filling up quickly,as more people came in for brunch/lunch. There is a counter where one can order sandwiches,salads,coffee,tea,but it looked again,as though the early birds got most of the pickings. Everything must be really good besides just the bread! I really loved the decor,made me think I was in a quaint country kitchen somewhere in France; very homey,the casual print tablecloths, with the designs tourists seem to favour, weren't even ironed. I loved it! Now there is another boulangerie to add to my fave collection.
