4	I love Carl's Jr and I can't wait until this one reopens!
2	I always try the current 6 Dollar burger special they have. The food is always just so so. It always seems a little cold like they let things sit around too long before slapped together and tossed in a sack. They are always friendly and the interior is clean, but the food quality is sub-par at best.
2	This place is okay. Service is slow. Everyone seems to be doing something but nothing at the same time. Food is okay. I have yet to find anything here that I really like enough to come back for.
4	Great for those lazy days where you don't want to cook
