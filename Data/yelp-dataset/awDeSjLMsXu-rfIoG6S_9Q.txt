5	I bought some stuff at lingerie for my girl friend and she loved and so did I ;)
5	Located in Boca Park. Before you get any funny ideas, I was there for an event. But I must say it is a very colorful place, and the staff are very nice. Everything in the store was high quality. If I am ever in the market for their wears I will come back, I think it's a good idea to shop local and not some giant chain. So there, Now I think I am going to go out and meet someone that I can but this stuff for. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
