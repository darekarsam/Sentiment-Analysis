4	I could live in a place like this, constantly having my teacup filled up and bacon rolls tossed into my gob.And I could afford to do that. I'm not rich, but this place isn't expensive. It's actually criminally cheap. You feel like you have to tip a fiver to even things out.Staff didn't even shoot me any evil looks as I nursed my cup of tea for a half hour before ordering food. Exactly what I want!!
