5	I really enjoy getting my hair done by Donna at Adah's Hair Castle! She has dyed my hair in various ways over the years- including highlights/ low-lights, dying it various types of red on top half and black on bottom half of my hair (or even dark brown upon request), she has even done purple streaks throughout my hair upon request! She has also done various blonde tints on my hair with lighter blonde shaded highlights if you aren't into the darker hair colors. She has cut my hair in beautiful layers when I ask her to or she'll do it all one length if I ask her to. (My hair is medium length to long too, so she has a lot to work on when I come in!) She is very down to earth and friendly, gives great customer service and has extremely affordable prices for her services!! She has the most affordable prices for quality hair care! She has even done hot oil treatments on my hair multiple times, leaving my hair feeling so soft and rejuvenated! I definitely recommend going to Donna at Adah's Hair Castle!! If you are interested in getting your hair done by Donna, check out her website- www.donnashaircare.com, it has all of the services she offers listed and prices for each service.
1	You have got to be kidding me?! Old stylists, even older clients nothing new or innovative. I guess this is where old stylists go to die!
