5	This is one of my favorites places to stay.  If work or pleasure brings you to Concord or Northern Charlotte, I suggest you stay here.All of the rooms are quite spacious and have a sofa, work desk, kitchen area with mini fridge and microwave along with a king size bed.One of my favorite things is the free hot breakfast.  We aren't talking your average continental breakfast here.  Most morning have scrambled eggs, grits, sausage or bacon, along with cereals, juices, and breads.  Best hotel breakfast around!
5	Had not stayed here in some time.  Still a high quality hotel that I prefer.They have added a power block in each room that not only allows for more electrical outlets, but also serves to recharge your cell phones, mp3 players, etc.  Hope more hotels add this convenience.The free hot breakfast is still a step above most any other lodging establishment.I highly recommend this Comfort Suites.
3	3 stars given:1)Free breakfast, 2)parking (oversized vehicle parking available). 3)Friendly front desk. Rooms are really old, . My group and I stayed here for a week and found that mattresses in several rooms were horrible.  There are microwaves, fridges in the rooms.
