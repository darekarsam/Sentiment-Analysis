3	Noodle hut is unpretentious. You get what you pay for.You can eat in if you absolutely have to. But except after an evening of drinking with friends i really can't think of a reason to stay in with such a spartan decoration.The food is decent. Nothing high end. But for a $6-10 dollar meal you can't expect a quisine menu. But ingredients are fresh, and it's prepared on the spot in a clean workplace.Portions are very reasonable. And you get a free soda with the specials.Definitly one of my favorite take-out places.
3	Medicore rice. Too spicy and had too large of vegetable chunks.
2	White washed cheap asian food. I dont know how often they change there oil or what kind they use but I feel sick or get headaches.
1	Tried this 4 times and got sick every time. Something is just so off about their chicken, like it's from a can almost... Yuck. I do not recommend this place to anyone...
