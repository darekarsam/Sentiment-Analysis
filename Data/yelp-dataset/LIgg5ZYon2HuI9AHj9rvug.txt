5	Great friendly service. Cage free. Cats welcome. No frills and cash only keep the costs down which is passed on to the customer.  $35 for shampoo, ear cleaning, cut and nails. Great deal. I will go there again
5	The groomer's here are the greatest dog lovers.  I wouldn't take my Maggie to anyone else!  I know when I drop her off she won't be put in a cage to sit and wait.  She is free to roam in the doggie waiting area, which is a great alternative to a cage.  She is always groomed quickly and looks beautiful.  2 paws up!
5	I am a veterinary technician and I have taken my two full-sized Australian shepherds and my mother-in-law's Shih-tzu to Bargain Barks with great results.  Pam and Alison are animal lovers and very good at what they do.  I highly recommend Bargain Barks.
5	Awesome care for all my pets. Alison takes great care for my rescue, Roxie, and her extreme case of water-phobia.
5	Took my two miniature schnauzers here and I have nothing but good thing to say! My dogs get a full shave (no schnauzer cut) but do get keep their beards and eyebrows. After a simple explanation, I felt in good hands. And when I came to pick them up, their trim was exactly what I wanted. The ladies here do a great job and I can't wait until my dogs next trim!
