5	I stopped by their yard to see if they had a certain type of gravel I was looking for. They had a ton of stone and gravel to choose from.  They helped me pick out the right kind of cover and gave me some great landscaping tips.  I even had them come to my home and install some curbing to provide a border between my lawn and gravel.  Their prices are great and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  The owner even helped me out directly. I definitely recommend these guys!
5	Great Company & Product! Hands down
1	They do not reinforce the curbing, they walk into your backyard at 6am unannounced and almost get shot. They rip up your stake markers for other projects. No one speaks understandable English. There contact at the office had an excuse for everything. Glad we kicked them to the curb before the project was completed. If you want to waste your time and money use these guys! Otherwise find a good company.
5	I have used these guys over the years several times for curbing and now they have granite and other supplies for landscapers and residential homeowners.  Their sales guy is great and always stops by my office to give me a Christmas gift which is nice too.  Their prices are fair and they have good customer service.  Not sure why the one star but I guess you cant make everyone happy.
