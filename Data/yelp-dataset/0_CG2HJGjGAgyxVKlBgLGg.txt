4	I agree with the other 2 reviewers. I work in the area and was crying out for consistency in taste and value when it came to lunchtime offerings and this place provides it. Probably the cheapest coffee in the area too...and it's Illy and good!
4	As i was made the Duchess at lunch time i thought i should probably review Fresh Cut.This wee sandwich shop on Lothian Road is one of those consistent places that does exactly what it says on the tin. Their menu is pretty big, offering sandwiches, paninis, soup etc. They have about 5 soups on their menu, and unlike other places these soups don't change (good for people who like having their set routine). Today i had a bacon, brie and cranberry panini and the mushroom soup, both were delicious. There have a decent amount of seating inside which is good for a bit of people watching on Lothian Road.The staff are pleasant enough and the prices are pretty standard. Not the most exciting review but i would recommend it!
4	I'm a bit of a lunchtime snob, and Lothian Rd is full of dodgy looking sandwich shops where you eye the congealed, mayonnaise type fillings (that clearly come from a cash and & carry) and 'shiny' ham suspiciously... I'd avoided this shop assuming, like previous reviewers, that it was just another one of those place that skimped on fresh ingredients. Boy, was I wrong!! I've been in several times now and it's one of my favourite lunch time takeaway places. I love the soups (5 varieties available but I'm a lentil soup all the way type of gal!) and salads where you can pick exactly what you want. Everything looks fresh and tasty and they have choices such as mini pickled onions, rocket, hummus, roast chicken, goats cheese, a variety of lettuce etc.. lots of things to make an interesting, healthy & v tasty salad. Yummy!
