5	This mobile pet grooming service is definitely "the way to go"!  Mike arrived on time, was wonderful with my pet, and gave me some very helpful advice.  We travel in a motor home, and finding quality pet grooming service is not easy.  I will recommend PRIMP MY PET to every I meet who needs the service.  We will definitely call him when we return to the area.
5	Lisa is absolutely amazing with my dog Sweetie. She makes Sweetie feel very comfortable. When Sweetie comes back she not only looks amazing but she feels amazing.
5	Really liked Lisa. She did a great job on my long haired cat without distressing the kitty at all. My cat doesn't like to be groomed, but Lisa just took over and Scrappy the cat decided to get into the action and groom herself while the clipping was going on. Will be using this group from now on. Love the mobile service.
