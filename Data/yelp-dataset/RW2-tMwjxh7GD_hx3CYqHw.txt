4	This store simply will not let you be in a bad mood. First of all, the name itself sort of makes you happy. Where you going? Swoozie's. Your mood already picks up. You walk in and there are bright colors demanding your attention from all corners of this large store, with books for you to browse through, pillows, cute signs, glassware, drink mixes and party platters, to name a few things. Frank Sinatra is playing in the background as you make your way through. If you are in need of a gift or just need to kill some time, head over to this feel-good store and you are sure to find whatever it is you are looking for.
4	Where Paper Skyscraper touches on party supplies and many various items, Swoozie's seems to focus solely on the party theme, kind of like an upscale Party City.  Swoozie's has a LOT of stationery options and party supplies and seems to be THE place for invitations.  They even offer printing for events like weddings, parties, etc.  From the bright (hot pink and purple) colors throughout the store, it's mostly a store for women and girls, but guys can find some cool party supplies and gift wrapping items there, too.  The holiday stuff is fun to look at and the after-holiday sales looked pretty good.  However, there's a lot of wide open space to allow for a lot of traffic, but perhaps they can fill some of it with more types of merchandise?
