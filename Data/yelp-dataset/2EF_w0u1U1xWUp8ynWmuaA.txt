1	Don't go here!  I went it for a bang trim and hair cut and came home with an uneven mess.  My hair is naturally straight with NO layers or anything else.  All I asked for was to have my bangs trimmed and the ends trimmed up to get rid of split ends.  When I came home I was embarrassed at how my hair looked.  It was unbelievable how uneven the bangs were and the ends of the rest of my hair was.  I would not recommend going here.  Also, the stylist I had wasn't very friendly and even criticized me for straightening my hair everyday.
5	Keith I am the Owner of the Salon and that was NOT me at shell buying Lotto tickets. We have no men that work there or ever have. I have no idea why he was in the salon or who he was with. The Salon has a great staff that takes pride in what they do there. I have recently purchased this Salon and we are trying hard to build and succeed.
5	Most of my fellow senior citizens spend time complaining, but this email is to thank you for the great haircut I received about a week or so ago.I didn't expect all that much, as I'm usually ushered into and out of barber chairs in about five minutes, but my experience at your store was different.It must have been the best haircut/styling I have ever had!I visited your shop at Via Paseo in Scottsdale and my haircut was provided by Ryan Valdez.Ryan took the time to ask what I was wanting in a haircut and he described what he could do to improve and update my style. He applied his impressive talent to give me a new look, with which I'm very happy and I will be patroniozing your Fantastic Sam's Salon at Hayden & McCormick for as long as Ryan is providing his professional services at that location. I've already passed on two referrals to friends and will at any opportunity.Thank you for offering such good service at your salon.David Matthews,Scottsdale
