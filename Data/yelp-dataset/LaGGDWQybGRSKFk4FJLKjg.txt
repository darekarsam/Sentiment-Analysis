5	Great place to kill time, get ideas, and be inspired.  The store offers very unique home accessories and home furnishings. Items you won't find at those busy mass retailers. While visiting North Carolina, I saw an ad in the paper for JKL Home Furnishings who originated in New York. Being a fellow New Yorker I decided to stop by since they had recently opened. The store itself was very quant and warm. I felt like I was walking into someone's home. The staff was very friendly and helpful enough, but out of your way when you wanted to burn some time just feeling out the way a couch or chair felt. The owners son was incredibly insightful. I'm not a designer and have trouble visualizing the products in my home. It can be overwhelming but he told me he went to school for design and got his degree in architecture so it was a great opinion to have.All in all I had a wonderful shopping experience at JKL Home Furnishings. I highly recommend it to others to visit and check out the unique/ vintage items they carry. They also have a Facebook page where you can request items that you may be looking for. Since I am in NY I check out their page very often to see the new items they bring in. I have already had a few items shipped to NY for me! Definitely take a look! https://www.facebook.com/JKLHomeFurnishings?ref=br_tf
5	Extremely knowledgeable and professional staff.  Hard to find pieces.  Excellent service.
5	Excellent pricing for quality.The corner cabinet met my need and purpose as I am an anti-MDF person.As I browsed the Etsy catalog, I fell in love with the gold mirror -- the right size and design.Furnitures were super duper clean and ready to use.It took me a month to get the furnitures as I had a few mishap with shipping vendors.  Jonathan was very helpful, patient and accommodating.  Thank you!  Easy and clear communication via text and email.I hope to get more pieces from JKL as I start to fill the space of my small apartment.
