4	I dropped by the opening of M-N-M's new location and came away impressed.  They converted what was an old water softener manufacturing plant into a cozy space for finishing a work project or catching up with friends over coffee.Things I like:* There are four or five varieties of Colectivo coffee to chose from, always served hot and fresh.  Bags of whole beans are available as well for the DIY crowd.* Free refills* Counter staff are super friendly, whether you are a regular or infrequent patron.* The fireplace, with a sofa and comfy chair strategically placed nearby.* The tables are not densely packed, allowing you to have a conversation with your tablemate and not the neighboring tables.* Chocolate Shoppe ice cream* Free, fast wi-fi (but you'll need to ask for the password)Things I don't:* The baked goods are lackluster.  The scones are far too soft - no exterior crust to provide contrast.  (Note to self:  Try to foster a strategic partnership with Batch or 4&20 or Bloom to import their baked goods into Waunakee.)* Their hours change seasonally, leading to an occasional unfruitful ice cream or caffeine run.The customer loyalty program is through Belly - twenty visits gets you a free coffee.M-N-Ms also has a light breakfast and lunch menu, but those items did not factor into my rating.Kudos to M-N-Ms for converting the old Hellenbrand Water storefront into a great gathering spot for the community.
5	Cutest place to hang out and read, work, or chat. Love the rustic tables and chairs! Yummy coffee drinks, too!
5	Best small town coffee shop in the area.  Family owned and friendly.  Oh, the coffee and breakfast is great too!!
