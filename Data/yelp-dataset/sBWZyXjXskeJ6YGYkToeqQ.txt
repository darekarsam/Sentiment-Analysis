1	Not sure if they are closed for good or temporarily.There were posters stuck up on their door with building code violations of some sort.  It looks like they are either packed up and left or undergoing maintenance for the violations.
1	I don't tan very often, but like to get a good base before I go to the beach. I bought a package last October for 5 tanning sessions and only used 1. When I went back in February to use another of my PREPAID sessions, I found that City Tan had closed.  I hadn't received a phone call, email, or any other notification whatsoever that they were closing and am very disappointed that I basically got robbed of $40. I never had a problem with City Tan when they were open, but closing with no notice even to those that had paid for packages is just unacceptable and very frustrating.
