4	This place open in the same location where Quiznos use to be. They're pretty quick to service you.
5	I just came into town for the day. Needed a quick bite to eat. While I was in line I witnessed the most obnoxious customer who was just down right rude to 3 staff members. Jessie was helping this customer and I was so impressed with how he handled this very rude customer. As I was eating my sandwich I watched this same employee sweep up the lobby and greet everyone walking in and out. My sandwich was good but I was most impressed by the supurb customer service Jessie was providing. Good job Jessie!
4	Great food.Fresh veggies.Quick and friendly service.Good prices. Seating areas could be cleaner though, especially since the place was empty when we walked in. Will probably be back.
1	Went here tonight to get late night dinner, and their credit card system was down. Since there was no note and I had to wait for the employee to spend 5 minutes discussing what to do with his boss, I was rather pissed when he refused to buy my sandwich. Horrible customer service, never go here!! YOUR CREDIT CARD PROBLEM IS NOT MINE, UNLESS THERE'S A NOTE ON THE DOOR OR REGISTER AND I'M NOTIFIED IN ADVANCE! THANKS!
