5	Molly is wonderful attorney to work with. I am glad I have her on my side.
5	I heard about Molly from one of many attorneys I met with through the free Ask-A-Lawyer program held weekly at the Clark County Family Court complex. What a blessing! Molly (and her staff) were amazing from every perspective. I was just informed of the judge's decision in my contested divorce yesterday and I could not be more pleased and grateful. Molly was always honest and straightforward (she never just told me what I wanted to hear) and her fees are extremely competitive. I really can' t say enough about how thorough, smart and assertive Molly is. She has a great sense of humor too, which doesn't hurt when you're going through a rough time.
