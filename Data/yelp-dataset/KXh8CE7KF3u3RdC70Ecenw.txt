5	Since living in AZ this is the only mechanic I go to that I can trust.  Amazing service at an amazing price.  My whole family and friends all take our vehicles to BD Car Care. Make sure to say hi to Dario and Allen when visiting.  These guys are real pros!!!
5	Amazing service and quality work. The owner Dario Is a great person to work with. My BMW runs great after the  repairs
5	all i can say that these people are honest and punctual. This is not an experience i had with other car shops. Unfortunately had to go to quite a few. I had dealt with Chapman BMW service several times before i came across this shop. They know their cars and have better customer service than Chapman BMW.
