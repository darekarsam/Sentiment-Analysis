4	This is truly a beautiful garden to stop at, especially in summer. It displays a delightful Japanese Garden among many others. During various times of the year, you can also view special events such as a Butterfly Exhibit and Chinese Lantern Festival. The Buttterfly Exhibit is an enjoyable and rare experience to observe hundreds of species fluttering about in absolute glory and wander. It's particularly a photographer's paradise! Besides, if you have a full day at leisure, you can combine this visit with a trip to the Biodome right next door.
5	You want to take a nice walk in winter. Jardin botanique de Montreal is a great place in winter or summer. Love it.
4	My favorite botanical garden is in San Francisco, when you wander down into the wood, surrounded by redwoods and a creek, with nary a city sound whispering through the pines. But this is a close second. To me, a botanical garden is an escape from the city. I'm not really a plant person, despite my love of the botanical garden, but I love the opportunity to wander into my own quiet, and to have a nice view while I do so. This garden did not disappoint. The Chinese garden is a superb example, calming, and almost like I was transported miles and miles east. And its examples of bonzai were phenomenal. Not only did I learn a ton about the work that goes into bonzai, but I simply have to respect a 270 tree that is smaller than a toddler.I also fell in love with the English vertical crevasse garden. Who ever heard of such a thing? Obviously some people, but not me. And now I want one. Thanks a lot, Jardin botanique.When I'm back in Montreal I'll definitely visit again. Sure, my spouse might be left in peaceful repose on a chaise somewhere, but that's okay, I'll get my own city escape, all to myself.
