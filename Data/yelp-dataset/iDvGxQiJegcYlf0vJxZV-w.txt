4	I really love Jimmy Johns!They bake the bread fresh daily and make your sandwiches fast, there are several different options and the customer service at this location is outstanding! They greet you when you walk in, ask you if you have any questions and even joke around with you...when I was trying to decide what to order the man behind the counter said "don't worry the delicious smells are available at no charge" :)I tried the # 11 COUNTRY CLUB which has fresh sliced turkey breast, applewood smoked ham, provolone, and tons of lettuce, tomato, and mayo. It was great! The bread totally makes the sandwich but it's also the great toppings they were fresh and since its made to order they will add whatever you like to make the sandwich your own. Overall this is a great place for a great sandwich and since they have several options it's perfect for anyone to enjoy!
5	I had to give them that extra star!!!!This place ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I stopped in today for lunch and lucky for me it was customer appreciation day! So subs were literally $1!!! I'm not kidding, that is not a typo they were selling the subs for $1!!!I tried the # 5 Vito which is the original Italian sub with genoa salami, provolone, capicola, onion, lettuce, tomato & a real tasty Italian vinaigrette. For an added kick they put on HOT peppers which for this sandwich are a definite MUST HAVE!!!!The service just like their motto was fast and efficient, my sub was on delicious freshly baked bread and the Italian vinaigrette dressing and hot peppers really made the sandwich great!I look forward to going back....I would have added a picture but this sandwich was so good...I just couldn't help myself!
5	The subs are very good, fresh vegs, quality meats and soft rolls.  The best part?  I have never been there.  That's right, never.  You see, they deliver and deliver FAST!  You can order online or by phone.
4	Good service
