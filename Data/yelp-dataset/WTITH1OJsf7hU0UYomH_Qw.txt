3	If what you need is a late night poutine with meat from a spit shaved on to it, just to put poutine over the edge and beyond, than this is the place. Don't look too closely at anything inside except the hand-painted portrait of the owner with his manly mullet on the window. Don't question your life choices too much as the midnight gravy hits your gut (and thighs.) Just enjoy the Double Red Line ride.
5	Excellent food, great ambiance the only downside is that it's not 24/7 :D
4	best poutine ever
5	Can't get enough of this small place! This has been here for years, and they never disappoint! If you are ever in Jean Talon, swing by this little gem, and treat yourself for delicious greek food!
4	one of the best gyro in town. i only go for the gyro and nothing else. that's what they are known for.opens late which is great when you drank the evening away on a summer night and you're walking home and are hungry but can't find anything in sight besides a tim hortons. they are great for that. closed on sunday though.its good once in a while but going too often, you'll get sick of it
