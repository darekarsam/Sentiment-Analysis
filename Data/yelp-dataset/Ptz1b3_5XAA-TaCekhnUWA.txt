4	Nice event. Lots of great craft beers from out of state.
5	A fine addition to the bevy of alcohol related festivals that make Old Town Scottsdale such a great place to be. This one is new and will surely get bigger and better each year.
5	Awesome! Best day ever!
5	This beer festival is always a great time.  The location is really nice at the Scotsdale Civic Center. There are plenty of trees to hang out under while trying all the awesome beers and it's never obnoxiously crowded.  The beer/event staff are always cheerful to those wandering around trying all the beers. They also have plenty of food trucks and live music to keep you happy all afternoon long. The only minor negative has to be the beer servers are just hired to hand out beer and to that end some some of them don't know a whole lot about the beer you are trying.  Which isn't a huge deal you either like it or not I guess.  If there is one beer festival to check out in the Phoenix area it is this one. It's always a good, good time.
