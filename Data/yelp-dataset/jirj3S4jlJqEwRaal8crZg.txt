1	WARNING!!!  Do not do business with them!!!  The are total frauds!!!  They charged me twice as much as the normal amount for a small repair at my home.   I would never use them again unless I want to get ripped off again!!!!
1	Too bad I give these guys a negative star....my upstairs ac was blowing hot air and I called precision air to come and give me a diagnostic. The tech was here Sunday afternoon and told me that to repair my unit would be between $4200 and $4800 to repair. He said I needed a new capacitor and motor or I could just replace the whole unit. I decided to get a second opinion. Thank the good Lord I did because they were definitely trying to rip us off. I had the parts replaced for $500. Quite the difference.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. They will charge you way more than what they should.
1	The technician would have charged to replace an igniter on my furnace(heather) for $350 dollars which cost $30 only parts, rest is labor.  What else, he recommended the motherboard, it would probably cost over a thousand.He was here 35 minutes and i choose not to go any further charge me $79. The customer service told me I would get military discount but the initial check did not count. I ask technician for a license but refused and gave the company card. I would not recommend this company. They promise to be in your house in one hour but after one and half hour no follow up. No good customer service. Will charge too much for too little. Don't CALL
