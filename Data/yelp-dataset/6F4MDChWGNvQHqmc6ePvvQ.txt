3	My quest to find awesome objects at thrift stores is ongoing, so I figured I'd give this location a look. Every time I go down Maryland Parkway from UNLV to Desert Inn Rd. I drive by the large THRIFT STORE and ADDITIONAL PARKING ON ROOF signs. Today was the day I finally went in.The store itself is medium sized and nicely organized. I didn't see any clothing I was interested in, but I did notice that on Fridays they have a $15 bag of clothing day.The day I went (Wednesday) it was half off books. I was tempted to purchase a large 1950's science book but abstained. I did end up getting a very cool 1950's glassware set for casual parties. Now I just need to have a casual party.Some of the prices were a bit steep, but I did see some neat stuff. Will definitely be checking back there in the future.
4	I loved this place! Yes it has a bad stink but you know what they say. The worst the stank the better the deals. I got a new light luggage for only 24$ I also found the clothing color desired for my work clothes for 1.99! Usually it's 3-7 $ at good Will. They have certain days where u bring a small carry on luggage and you fit as much clothing you want and it's all 15$!!! I know Wednesday is one of those days. But they do close early those days. I love Nevada thrift stores!
