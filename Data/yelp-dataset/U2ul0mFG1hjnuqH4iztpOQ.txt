3	Although not where I get my mules from these days, Clarks will still always have a special place in my heart from childhood when my mum would buy me super cute Magic Key school shoes and some Doodles for running amok in. This branch of Clarks is huge and is full to the brim with sensible brogues and good quality shoes for the kids. The price of Clarks shoes have always been very reasonable for the quality and they will definitely last a full school term.In the past couple of years, Clarks have tried to be cool but it hasn't really worked for them, on occasion they have some nice winter Boots but I think they should just stick with what they do best; sensible.
4	There are few more enjoyable memories of being 5 years old than a trip to Clarks which involved getting my foot measured in their machine. It was a source of constant excitement and trepidation, and thus a trip to Clarks comes highly recommended if you're only recently out of the womb.From an adults viewpoint however, Clarks is a fairly solid, dependable and dull shoe store. Their stuff isn't exactly high fashion but it does the trick, and their presence on the High Street for several decades shows they're doing something right.
