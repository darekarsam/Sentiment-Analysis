5	Very friendly and highly skilled barbers. There is always a wait but it is worth it.  I've been here every week or so for about two months now and I have never been disappointed. Fades, trims, shaves... They are also very kid friendly!
5	Was on this side of town and I needed a cut. The barber (Mike) did an awesome job. Asked for clarification if anything was vague. Awesome price. I would come here again if I'm on the west side.
5	Awesome place!!! I am new to the Avondale/Tolleson area and I could not decide which barber to go to.  So many on every corner stating they are better than the next place.  Till I found Sal's Barber Shop. Found this place through reviews and driving around.  Once I arrived I was greeted by 2 professional barbers and was helped by Clay.  Me being in Finance for an Auto Dealership I needed to look sharp and lined up.  Well Clay exceed my expectations and now I'm feeling like a GQ model lol.The atmosphere here was super friendly and up to date on all the newest cuts...   Clays experience is ranked over and beyond with service that out did "The Art of Shaving" stores.  Full steam towel for the razor shave on the face to razor hard part for my hairstyle to cleanest fade that can not be matched.  I HIGHLY recommend Sal's Barbershop # 2 and it's a must to ask for Clay.  1st chair on the left...  You won't regret it.. Let him know Anthony DeLaPaz sent you.
