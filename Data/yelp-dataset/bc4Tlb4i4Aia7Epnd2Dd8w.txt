3	Good for gym clothes and some clearance items- go elsewhere for anything else.Clearance section is a jumble, womens and juniors sections both mixed up together. Store has a giant cosmetics area and half-decent furniture and home decor, but I came for clothes and there was no organization to any of the sections I browsed and dresses were strewn all over the place.Went at noon on a weekday, so it's not as if I came just prior to close and wondered why it looked like a bomb had hit it.
1	Talk about rude . I came in to return something with a receipt from Home Goods . I was told I can return stuff to TJ Maxx . Before I even got 2 words out of my mouth the " manager " rudely said " you can't bring that here , no no no , we don't do that here ." Needless to say how their staff was just standing there twiddling their thumbs this store is going to go great .
