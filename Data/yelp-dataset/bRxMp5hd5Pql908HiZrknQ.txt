5	Among the hardest-to-find essentials for every woman are the perfect shade of lipstick, an amazing pair of black boots, and an honest mechanic. Finally, I've got all three!Zovko Bros is a family-owned business that performs state inspections and general repairs. In fact they keep my 1995 Geo Prism running beautifully despite my often indelicate and irresponsible treatment of the poor, dear thing. I've gone there for my inspections for the past several years and for some major and minor repair work as well. Each and every time I could not have been happier with the results.I LOVE these guys. They are super nice and respectful, not intimidating, fair, and fast. They do GREAT WORK and they will not charge you and arm and a leg to do it. Because they are located at the corner of 25th and Carson, you can kill time at the nearby South Side Works. So shop, eat, watch a movie - and one of the guys will call you on your cell when your car is ready. Write them a check and drive off into the sunset with your motor purrin'.
1	I came to get my 95 Toyota Avalon inspected. They called me saying that my exhaust needed completely replaced and my back rotors where completely worn down. They wanted $1100 to fix all of that in order to pass the inspection. I told them to fail the inspection and took it to an independent mechanic. The independent mechanic welded and fixed the exhaust (without replacing it) and checked the rotors (which were fine) and passed the state inspection and emissions test. He was able to do this all for $200. Do not go here. They will overprice you so much. They will exaggerate any issues that are on your car and try to make unnecessary notifications.
