5	I took a class that Monique taught while I attended UNLV.  She is extremely patient and knows how to teach in a fun and inspirational manner, while allowing you to work on what you like.  Piano is extremely difficult but with Monique, it is at least easier!  She is also an extremely sweet person which makes showing up easier too.  Good luck to everyone out there trying to play piano, it's not easy, but it is possible!
3	I found her for my mom who lives in Las Vegas thru "yelp".  My mom was not happy with her - she should of posted her parameters of service with her pricing and not charge more when she walked into the session :(
