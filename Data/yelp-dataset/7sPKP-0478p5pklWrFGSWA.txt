1	This store is run by a bunch of teenagers with zero customer service. Everything is non-refundable and they don't offer holds. When I spoke to the manager, Esmeralda, about this she rudely told me, "everything is fair game." They really need to work on their customer service considering 99% of their dresses are overpriced tacky nonsense. Will NOT be returning to this store. Corporate really needs to come in and reevaluate their management at this store because I have never been to a Windsor with such awful customer service.
3	Everytime  I shop here I have a good experience. I don't always leave with something due to limited selection. The website has more and the store gives u an idea.
