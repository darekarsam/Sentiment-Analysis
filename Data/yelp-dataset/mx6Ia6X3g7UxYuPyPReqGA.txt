4	It's in the shape of a butterfly! You probably won't know it by just being there, but seeing it on the map as I added the business I discovered that the pathway forms a butterfly shape. There are cement prints of butterflies throughout the park as well. I have driven past one of it's entrances (near Ru San's) for years and had been curious where it goes. Today I solved that mystery. If you are looking for a quiet park, this makes the short list. It's a clean park with a playground for the kiddos, tennis court, 1 basketball hoop, a mini sandbox, and a rotunda. It would be ideal for a family party or picnic with friends. Plus, there is plenty of open space to throw a frisbee or play catch with your pooch. I just adore parks and this one was a pleasant surprise.

The playground looks super fun, not that I've ever played on it....There is also a basketball half court, Tennis court and a picnic shelter - pretty legit for the small park.  It's super close to the track at Sedgefield Middle School as well, so if you want to do some laps then play some hoops, its all right there!
