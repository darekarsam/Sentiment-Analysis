5	I've been going here for 7 months now and it has been the best fitness class I have ever joined. Great job Aluja!
5	Noy is a fantastic trainer, combining the important and challenging fundamentals of boxing like footwork with the fun of getting your hits in. I'm a first time boxer but looking forward to much more in the future, and highly recommend Cardio Kings Fitness Boxing for other folks considering it.
5	I was in Vegas this past weekend to cheer on some marathoners and searched Yelp for a boxing class I could do.  I take a boxing class regularly so I hated to miss a week by being out of town.I found Cardio Kings Fitness Boxing and scheduled a one-on-one with Aluja.  What an incredible experience I had!  Aluja was amazing- intense, supportive and knowledgeable.  He pushed me, encouraged me and gave me one of the best workouts I have ever had!I highly recommend Aluja and Cardio Kings Fitness Boxing- a truly great workout that is also fun and inspiring.  I just wish he was local for me!!
