3	The Spirit Halloween shops are finally opening up, which means it's that special time of year again! We stopped in tonight to get some ideas of what to be this year. We usually make our own original costumes, but this place is great for getting ideas or a quick costume in a pinch. Also, lots of great accessories. It can be a little pricey but most pre-made costumes are.If you sign up for their e-mail list they will send you a 20% off coupon. Happy haunting!!
5	This is an annual trek my nieces and I do.  We enjoy the fun displays and all the Halloween items.  The store adds to the excitement of the holiday for us.
4	Love it! Every gory, gross, disgusting, terrifying thing you need to do up a costume or your Halloween home decor the right way!!!
