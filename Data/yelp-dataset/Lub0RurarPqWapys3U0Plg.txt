5	This is my "home" Starbucks store, located in the Upper Lobby of the U. S. Steel Tower.  Calling it the UPMC building will summon a wrath I'm sure you'd rather no experience.The service is excellent, and the staff knows a good bit of their clientele by name which is impressive since this 52 floor building has a lot of coffee addicts.  On occasions that my syrups have tasted off, they've always remade my drink without asking questions.  And if they get the size wrong I always get the extra drink, which is a nice bonus ... as if I need any more caffeine.I have taken breaks from coffee in the past, be it for caffeine overloads or simply trying to save money ... but this particular location always welcomes me back with open arms.
5	This is the best Starbucks ever! I look forward to coming here every morning. The staff is incredibly friendly and will remember you by name. I spilled my coffee by accident a few weeks ago and the worker came over and cleaned it up and gave me a new drink for free! I work down on first avenue but always make sure I leave early enough to be able to stop at this location. I will always be a proud customer of this Starbucks and I would suggest this one to anyone!
4	The drinks come up fast and the baristas are always energetic and over the top friendly. I work in customer service so I know that we're all paid actors but I like the energy of the barista staff. This Starbucks is located in the building I work in which makes me very happy to have such a great Starbucks so close to work.I have never had a bad drink here, nor a bad attitude. Keep up the good work.
1	Worst Starbucks store in Pittsburgh. There is no management and all of the decent workers end up leaving. I can't get a simple cup of drip coffee without having to wait 5 min in line to order and then another 5 min while the poor idiots figure out how to fill my cup. I'm done!
