1	This place ugh. Allow you to book appt online and typically that is great but I've been sitting here for an hour past the time they told me to come in and still have not been seen. Very frustrating to hear nurses talking about their meals when there are people waiting. Grrr
5	We went in on a Thursday; no appointment there was 1 couple in front of us, they called us back maybe had to wait 10mins in the waiting room; when in the back the wait was nothing they were fast and caring....and it was very clean. We were very pleased!!
4	My husband brought me to the clinic on Thanksgiving after I was feeling VERY dizzy all morning and wasn't going away. The wait was average, they had others to see before it was my turn. My head was down almost the whole time but from what I seen the clinic was clean and orderly. I wish they would have had a bench or something so the ones that need to lay down can. The male nurse was very nice and the doctor was very good. He did what he could, check my urine. He thought I was dehydrated since we just moved here and am not used to the weather yet. He called some antibiotics in. I went home, drank a whole bunch, rested and felt better later on that night. I was very impressed that they didn't treat me like crud ( even though I looked and felt like crud) like alot of doctors do. I will go back there and will tell anyone I can to go there also.
2	Waited an hour for a flu shot... RidiculousI came after a suggestion from walgreens that it was cheaper and easier there. This was not true. My time is worth more than a $7 discount. Also staff was not impressive, massive bruise the morning after from adjusting the needle in my muscle. Will not return.
