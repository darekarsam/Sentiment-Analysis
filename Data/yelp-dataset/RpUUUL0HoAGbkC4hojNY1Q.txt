4	This place was so new that the location is not even on their company website, but I gladly accepted their opening special - a 'Nutella' filled rolled crepe for $1.99 + tax, for my perfect afternoon snack. I imagine it will do for an in between class snack for the nearby Concordia student population. The high ceilings and modern space has a somewhat standard feel (more common) these days. Three large flat panel screens display their sweet and savory crepe choices, smoothies as well as a full list of coffees. The two young gentlemen serving the counter were friendly and fun in their dialogue with me concerning the Japanese style display case filled with silicon models of menu items. It's amazing how real and edible they can look from a little distance - save for the smoked meat model looked a little pale and more like a smoked salmon filling. My new counter buddy insured me that it tasted quite good. I don't think they have that filling in Tokyo or anywhere in Japan for that matter, but I'll go back to see if he's right.

The two are similar in that they both come with cheese, the deli meat, corn kernels, and are topped with lettuce, tomato and mayo. They make the crepes fresh in front of you and it only takes a couple of minutes each, so it really is fast food without feeling like you're eating junk. We took them out for a stroll and settled at Con U to eat, but just a FYI: they come as I show in the picture, there's no real take-out package option. They have other 50 types of crepes (I'm sure you can customize them too) as well as smoothies and a few other things - I was starving so I was too busy eying my crepe in my hand to check out much else. Only a few seats but in this gorgeous weather, you can easily eat it as you take a stroll if it's busy.
