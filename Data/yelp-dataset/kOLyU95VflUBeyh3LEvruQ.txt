4	Hmmm Guacamole 6$ burger. food - tasty burgers, as far as fast food goes, i think they have a tasty, Caloricly suicidal, burger...next to Burger King..i think it is the most flavorful and good (not saying good for you tho). also, i think they got new fries..because they were pretty damn good.location - ummm could be worse. needs a refresher, remodel. employees - very nice. not bitter fast food workers. brought food to my table and i didn't need to leave a tip.corner of Washington and 24th street.

3	For fast food, this is some pretty good stuff!I had some chicken fingers and a chicken cesar wrap. it was good for $4.
5	I feel silly giving a five star review to a fast food place but the service here was the best I've had at a fast food restaurant! Props to the lady working the front today, 11/12/13 4:30pm. Very helpful and sweet. The food was fresh and very tasty too. Two thumbs up :)
3	Just isn't very good.I hate to give a less then favorable review to any establishment.  So let's start off on a positive note.  Carl's Jr is a clean restaurant with friendly and helpful  staff.  Now for the not so good part.  I realize Carl's Jr is a fast food resturant so I don't expect a burger like that from the Actic. However, I do expect the food to be fresh and taste good. Today, on my visit  to Carls Jr I had chicken fingers and zucunni. The chicken fingers were not seasoned and tasted as if it had been under a heat lamp for some time and that's why the chicken was so dry. The zucunni while it was fresh and served hot, the taste just wasn't good. The only enjoyable part of my lunch experience was my diet Dr pepper.
