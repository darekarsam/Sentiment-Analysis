1	My boyfriend and I walked into the store looking for a bed frame and a queen size mattress for our new house. We are both 21, so we know were going to get some weird looks from salesmen when making big purchases like this. We make good money for our age though and have a lot going on for us. We walked in and it was awkwardly deserted inside. There were only two workers in the store, both male, and they made absolutely no attempt to greet us or even get off their butts to say anything to us. They both stayed sitting down as we walked past them and simply just said hello. We immediately left the store based on their lack of customer service. We walked next door to Ashley Furniture and got greeted immediately like we were important guests and ended up getting our credit approved for $4000.00 worth of furniture and ended up buying a nice mattress and sofa! Don't judge customers based on age.
1	Rude, unprofessional.  Two males,  No attempt to greet us, or acknowledge we were in the store.  Plus we were the only customers in the store??  Wonder why they going out of business.   I decided to spent our money on a kid bedroom set next door to Ashley.  Best choice we made.
