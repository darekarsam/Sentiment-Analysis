5	Great food, service and prices. It's in a not so great part of town, but lock your doors and it's definitely worth it. Best baked goods in the area! Try the almond torte!!
5	Thanks to Darren's sis Jessica, we had some excellent cookies for our housewarming party. I liked ths sugar cookies with the jimmies best and the half-dipped chocolate chips, but they were all good. It's too bad about the area in which it is though.
5	Came here from PGH for the first time.  This bakery is legit.  I bought some Rye bread and Italian 5 grain.  Delicious.  A strange snickerdoodle thing with pink frosting.  Delicious. Chocolate chip cookie dipped in chocolate, extra chewy and humongous.  Delicious.And a sweet old lady serving em up.The best.Delicious.
5	Absolutely the best bakery I've been in ever! The cookies are delicious. The nut rolls. & coffee cakes are heaven. Put on your bucket list to eat an almond torte. It is extremely memorable. I will dream about Minerva's delicacies until I return to visit the Burgh again. Btw - the staff is the best.
5	It sounds crazy to drive to Mckeesport for a cookie but Minerva is the BEST! Cookies and pies are incredible. Cakes are lovely and the pastries are worth the workout to get rid of them. They have a wide selection and now take credit cards. Its worth calling ahead on the holidays. This is not the Giant Eagle, sometimes they sell out.
4	This is my favorite bakery. I always get great service and have never been disappointed with anything. Their toasted almond torte is to die for. I AM ALWAYS POLITE TO THEM, MAYBE THAT'S WHY I GET GREAT SERVICE!
