5	My wife and I've taken our cars there for the past few years.  We really trust them and they are always honest and upfront about estimates, costs and then actual charges.  I recommend them to all of our friends.  They also will give you a ride to and from your house if you live close enough.
4	Have had my cars serviced here for the last few years. I can't say I'm wild about what they charge - but they are true to their estimates. They do good work, as I have never had any problems with anything they have fixed. They get things done quickly too, which is always good.
1	Once upon a time, these guys were pretty good.Times have changed.You should look elsewhere.
1	Stay away from this rip-off joint. Took my car there because my air conditioning wasn't working. They said I had a line leaking and needed over $800 to fix it, plus I needed a bunch of other stuff totaling $1100. I wanted a second opinion and took it somewhere else where they said there was no line leak only a bad o-ring. Walked out with an $85 tab vs $1100
1	Rip offs. My boss insisted I take my car to Blackwell. 1100. Later it was worseBack next day. They said blown head gasket. Wanted addional 2200.00. I picked it up.  Shop Owner asked for 1st dibs if I sell it. Took to Pete Kellys Automotive. Two fouled plugs and overflow leak. 400.00.  Woman stay away. Thanks  Pete Kellys
5	Our whole family has been using Blackwell for over two decades now. If you want your mechanic shop to be knowledgeable, professional, courteous and caring look no further. They have always bent over backwards to meet our needs and stay on quote. Simply the best.
