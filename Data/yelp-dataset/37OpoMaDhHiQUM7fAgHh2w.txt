5	It's a shame there aren't any reviews on here already for this place. I lost my eCig last night and needed a replacement. I had never been an actual smoker but picked up vaping from my coworkers. The last eCig I had...I had juice which had nicotine in it. Something I didn't really need.The lady who helped me was warm and friendly, showed me the EVOD (which is new) and explained all the features about it. I was sold! The price was good, too. She made sure to ask me about my habits and showed me a selection of zero nicotine juice. She let me smell a few to make my choice. Overall, I am glad I came in!
5	I have to say the family that owns this place is awesome. Exceptional customer service and never once been rude. I live down the street and been coming here for almost two years.
