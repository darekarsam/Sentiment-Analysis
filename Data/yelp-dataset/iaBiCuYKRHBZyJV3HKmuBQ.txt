2	The best things about brunch at this place: the lovely patio out back, and the menu - the dishes are all named after world newspapers, which was entertaining for the first few minutes of our visit.The worst things: the execution and the service. My ham and cheese omelette (Le Parisien) was burnt on the outside, and the principal flavour was salt. The home fries too were horribly over-salted. My wife's baked eggs with hollondaise and smoked salmon (the Financial Times) were only slightly better. And the service? Coffee arrived about 20 minutes after we sat down, and a good five minutes after our food. Getting the staff's attention to ask for water refills was next to impossible -- a situation made worse by the over-salted food. The evening menu consists of a half-dozen traditional bistro dishes. I don't think I'll be going back to try them.
3	I had a very nice savoury crepe here. I absolutely love crepes and this one was pretty good. Maybe a little heavy on the bechamel but the richness of the sauce matched up well with the spinach and mushrooms.
4	Very good food. I'm never disappointed.
4	My friend ordered the Croque-monsieur nicoise. Toasted white bread with Jambon de Paris, "Pistou" - a basil and garlic based pesto typed spread and anchovies, BAKED IN CHEESE, with a side of fries and salad. HOLY CRAP, this thing was huge too! It was one of those sandwiches where you had to eat it with a knife and fork, something I don't agree with, but there's no other way. I never knew the French done up their sangwiches this pimp before... real talk.
