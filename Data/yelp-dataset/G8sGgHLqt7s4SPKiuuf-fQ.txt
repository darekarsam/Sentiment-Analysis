4	Nice casual "down home"style restaurant located on the seedier side of the village. We were a large group who were well-treated by staff and the owner/cook himself,who is as entertaining as he is educational. I learned a good bit about various spices, seasonings and mire pois, that are typically used in New Orleans style cooking. As for the food,this is more home cooking as opposed to gourmet.Very filling,( thank Goddess the waitress warned me), and the half portions of the various dishes will do,unless you're a big eater.  There is also a "tasting" dish of 4 entrees , should you just want a taste of different "plats". My half portion gumbo was tasty and "stick to your ribs",and my half portion of shrimp creole,was basically a couple of shrimp in Spanish rice. As I said,this is casual home style cooking as opposed to gourmet. All dishes are under $15.00 and even with a beer or cider,your bill will be under $25.00. Service very attentive,warm and informative.Wonderful spot for casual,friendly atmosphere dining.
3	Went here last night and it turned out to be their last in business.  This place is now officially closed.  It's a shame because while the service was off the food was actually pretty good.
