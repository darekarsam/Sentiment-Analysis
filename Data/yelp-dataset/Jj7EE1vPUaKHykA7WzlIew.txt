3	Not a bad place to pick up supplies for Mixology class! In fact, quite coincidentally, several of us ran into each other doing just that.Basic bar supplies, glasses, bottles, just about whatever you need, but just the basic stuff...but what else would you expect? For the cool stuff, there are plenty of online places to get your fancy on.Where they shine is in restaurant supplies! Check it out....fun place to forage!
5	Love the service, the supplies are awesome, staff is knowledgeable, polite and PASSIONATE about what they do!  Why go anywhere else?
4	Very friendly service and a nice selection at this restaurant supply store. This is a small business, so they don't have every kitchen item that you might want, but they have a lot of things, and commercial-grade quality. I picked up a hefty polypropylene cutting board on my last visit. Vastly superior to the department store versions. Fair prices, too.
