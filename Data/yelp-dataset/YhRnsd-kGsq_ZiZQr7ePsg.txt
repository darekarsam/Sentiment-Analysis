4	I really enjoy this course.  Desert and water landscape.  Not to difficult for me as I am far from being a pro.  The staff is really friendly.  The only problem I have is I never see the beverage carts.  You have to stick up from the gift shop because you are not allowed to bring your own and I think I've seen a beverage cart once in the 10 times I've played here.
1	Ive been playing golf for seven years at apache wells golf course all year round. I was always pleased with the staff and the condition of the course. Spent alot of money on greens fees with foursomes every week. Up until recently everything was fine until the new management came in and changed alot of personal and policies as well as the price gouging they are currently doing to all there loyal customers. Rates were always less than $39 in peak season and that included tax. Now they want $50 plus tax..i played in their shotgun format for the last six weeks at $40 bucks and the field was empty and now they raise it even higher..i dont mind a business making money..especially on winter visitors but they should remain somewhat loyal to az residence who play their course all year long..looks like ill be playing elsewhere now..there is plenty of nice golf courses i can play for less..pissed off loyal customer.
2	Great food great staff and great atmosphere.
1	Had New Years eve dinner here this year and it was the worst meal I have ever had in my life. Last year the dinner was great. Don't know how the food is during the day. I will never eat here again. They have a problem.
