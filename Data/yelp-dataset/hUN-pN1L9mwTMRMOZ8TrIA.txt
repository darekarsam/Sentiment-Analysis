5	After reading the reviews made, this doesn't seem to be a good restaurant. However, I decided to give it a try anyway, since I always tend to try lots of asian restaurants. My first impression after entering the resto: I really like the atmosphere.. it's so asian like: we don't see on chairs like other resto, and we have to get our shoes off at the entrance. Not only the decoration was really good, the food was excellent! Brief, the dinner was really memorable, and you get what you pay.. Will definitely come again :)

5	Hard to find any fault with the restaurant or the experience.  Our waiter contributed substantially to our pleasant evening.  The miso soup was one of the best I have had and the rest of the meal was creative, tasty and well presented.  I would have preferred a larger selection of sake... But the one we had was reasonable and tasty.  A great dinner experience.  I love Montreal.
