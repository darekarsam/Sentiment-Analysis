5	I had the most amazing experience with this company! I highly recommend them. Chris was our technician and he was awesome! He was fast knew what the problem was on our refrigerator and washer. I was charged actually less than what I expected. I will always use this company.
4	On two occasions I have called these guys to save the day.  Once was in 2008 for a refrigerator that was running warm, the second today for the repair on my LG washing machine.  They are prompt, professional and great.  If you want trusted care with no BS, these are the guys to call.  Trust me.  They will be there that day or the next day.
5	I called this company and they came out to fix my refrigerator ice maker the same day. I talked to the technician and he gave me the estimate on the phone. He arrived fixed my ice maker and charged me the same price he quoted me. I was very satisfied!! Excellent Service! Great customer service.

5	I have to say that I had a great experience with these guys. I called at approximately 1:30 on Thursday afternoon and got their answering service. They took my information and said someone would contact me shortly. Two minutes later I received a call. We talked about my refrigerator and what might be the problem and some pricing and I gave them the go ahead to come over. I kid you not, they were there within 10 minutes. He quickly fixed the issue (a fried computer board) and was on his way. Total time from first call to job completion was no more than 40 minutes. The tech happened to be close by so you may not be so lucky, but it worked well for me. Highly recommended!
