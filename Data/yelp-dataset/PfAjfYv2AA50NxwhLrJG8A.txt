3	I didn't even know this place was so close to my house. It is clean and well lit. Automatic scoring and friendly folks. Good happy hour specials and apparently the bar that is attached like most bowling alleys has entertainment on the weekends.
4	I've been to this bowling alley twice for family events and each time I have been pleasantly surprised with how nice it is. The facility has 44 bowling lanes and a bar with plenty of seating and a pool table. The atmosphere is updated and very clean. I felt they had done a nice job with helping my group to hold an event here as well. The food is a little bit above average for what you expect for bowling alley food and the full service bar is a nice perk. The arcade they have here is pretty small an pitiful, but that's not what you come here for. The furnishings here are beautiful and comfortable especially for a bowling alley. Only downfall is that the technology appears outdated and could be replaced to match the rest of the bowling alley, however it seems to work fine. Overall this is defineitly the nicest bowling alley I have ever been to and would suggest coming here.
