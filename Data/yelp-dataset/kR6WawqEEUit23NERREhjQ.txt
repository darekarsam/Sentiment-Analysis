5	I love secondhand shopping. I always have, I can't remember the first time I went but I definitely grew up spending weeks every summer living in Kensington Market in Toronto, where every day included a meander and dig in the different second hand and thrift and vintage shops in the area, scoring old leather jackets and 50s dresses and those 70s wrap skirts I wore for most of my teens. The Sally Anns in MTL were my best friends in high school - so much fashion on a non-existent budget! 2$ tshirts and funny sweaters and mens dress shirts and hats and even a purple bow tie I wore for way too long. This Sally Ann on Notre Dame is one of my favourites because it's huge, and because of the big room in the back devoted to furniture, and because of that time one of my favourite profs had her office set up in there as part of a project on second hand economy and we had a meeting there with her on comfy old couches while people dug for deals around us. I love the find at an amazing price, and the odd clothes no one else will be wearing, and the odd lots of donated amazing things up for auction in the front. You won't always find an amazing score but if you like to look and hope this is a good spot to start.
