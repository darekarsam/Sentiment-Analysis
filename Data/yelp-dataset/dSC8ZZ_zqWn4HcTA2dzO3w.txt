5	I highly recommend this practice! The dentist, hygienist, and office staff are very thorough, attentive, and proficient. I was very impressed that everyone was so friendly, that the hygienist was so thorough, and especially that the dentist (Stephanie) actually took time to have a real conversation before my exam. Unlike my experience at other dentists, my appointment didn't feel rushed, which was refreshing and welcome. Everyone from the front desk to the billing department is terrific. It's obviously a well run and pleasant office environment because everyone seems happy to be there. The office is very clean, and welcoming, and the exam rooms appear to be state of the art. I had my teeth cleaned, X-rays taken, and they even squeezed me in for a filling the very next day!
5	Who likes going to the dentist?  Well, it is not always the most pleasant experience but Stephanie K Dentistry is by far one of the best that I have been to.  Convient Central Phoenix location, super friendly staff, cozy and swank office, high tech with digital imaging which uses less radiation than most places, electronic paperwork, they answered all my questions, explained everything, and did I mention super friendly.  I felt comfortable from the moment I walked in to when I left.  If you are looking for an awesome dentist this is the one!And they see kids too.
