5	Awesome venue! So spread out and enjoyable on a mid October day! Beer selection was great and food even better! Pull up a blanket on the grass, drink beer, and listen to music
4	Awesome venue. Great beers. What elsa could you ask for. Ive been to all the beer festivals in LV. It is in the top 3. Come see!
3	Lots of good beers and several  . . . unique ones. Good music and fun. Early entry was definitely worth it. VIP access, not so much. Very little food in the VIP pavilion, and it was scarce.
