5	Great Smoothies! Every time I go to the mall I get a smoothie from here. They also sell ice cream and other sorts of beverages. I enjoy the raspberry and pineapple smoothie. Yum!
5	Delicious! !! Needed something healthy, light and with protein :) definitely recommend! !!
1	These guys have become so busy that they do not care about customer service. The two girls behind the counter are rude! I asked for a coupon card, and they acted like they don't know what that is. Next time, I told them my drink didn't taste good, and they dumped it in front of me in anger. Seriously, I pay for good service. Finally, I complained to the manager who took the employee's side and didn't hear me out. If this weren't the ONLY place to get a smoothie, I would never come here. But, guess what, I am not coming here, because I do not want to deal with unnecessary anxiety.
