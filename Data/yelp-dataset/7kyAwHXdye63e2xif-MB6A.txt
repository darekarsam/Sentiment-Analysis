5	Truly a find. This is a very small restaurant (seats maybe 25), hidden in the middle of and otherwise unremarkable block.  The menu is generally French, with the kind of cosmopolitan influences one would expect in Montreal. The food is mostly locally sourced and seasonal. Whatever you do, do not skip dessert. Reservations are recommended as it is a well known secret amongst locals.
