4	Tried Albert's awhile back, and while it had promise, it simply lacked something to get me to come back...  well, they fixed that problem!I've been meaning to stop by ever since they started advertising the new craft beer tap they installed (20 new taps in addition to the 8 the already had), and much to my surprise, they also brightened it up inside.While its a smoking bar, half of the bar is designated as non-smoking and has a decently effective smoke elimination system that makes it bearable (even for an asthmatic).  Beers are reasonably priced and the crowd represents a diverse mix townies and young professionals.Overall, this is a good dive bar that fits the bill for a great place to drink with friends (pool table, etc.)...  especially for those groups with a mix of smokers and non-smokers.
5	Albert's is a great relaxed spot to grab some high quality, great priced craft brews.  They have 20+taps with a wide variety of craft beer.  They frequently have great specials on high end craft brew.   Good TV's and non-smoking have moved this old school lounge into the modern era.
5	One of my favorite bars to play pool at in the area. They have a league there so the players usually range from good to holy cow. Drinks are reasonable or cheap, service is good, karaoke some nights, spacious, and good people
4	Big fan of Albert's. Cheap drinks and a really nice place to play a game of pool. Great place to watch a Pens game!
