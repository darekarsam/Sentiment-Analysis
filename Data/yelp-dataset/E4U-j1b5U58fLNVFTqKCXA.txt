4	Promptness is key to a great business.  We had an appointment at 4:30pm but they didn't get to my office until 5:05pm.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.  I shouldn't talk really.  Being Filipino, I'm always running late on appointments.  Oops!  hehe.  :D  Once they arrived, they definitely got straight to work.  The team members who cleaned our carpets were very friendly and happy to have our business.I watched them spray the carpet with some kind of solution, then used this rug scrubbing machine, and lastly steam cleaned the entire office.  For six rooms, they only took about 45 minutes to get done.  Plus, the carpets were very well cleaned.  I know I said I'd only use Universal Carpet Care, but for those who did not have a great experience with them can also use Immaculate Carpet Care.  Prices are very similar and affordable.
2	First time they came they did a good just cleaning the carpet but there where spots on the floor that they didn't clean up.  Second time they came they came late they where suppose to come in the morning from 8am to 12pm which they came after 1pm. When they came for the second time they took out one spot but not the other.
5	I have been using immaculate for about 7 years. They just did my house and a rental and did a great job. Great prices, don't try to upsell or change price and do a great job.
