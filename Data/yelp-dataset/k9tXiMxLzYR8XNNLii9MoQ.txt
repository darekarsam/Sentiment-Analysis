1	Beware of this mortgage lender. They will pre-approve your mortgage, charge you 500$ for an appraisal on a house that you entered into contract on, and the ultimately deny you for no reason.  You may also lose your Ernest money deposit.  This happened to me.  My situation was financially better then when I got the pre approval, but I received a denial letter 30 days after our original closing date. Do not expect any communication from anyone at the vegas office or your loan processor in Atlanta. I had the pleasure to get Andy Welker.  If he is assigned as your processor, I would either a.) request another processor b.) run away
1	More like "last option". Totally unqualified people with no common sense. Made our closing very difficult and delayed by more than 3 weeks. Luckily we found a reputable lender with Lone Mortgage and closed in less than 2 weeks.
5	We've used Aaron Schwamberg twice now in the last three years at First Option and he's done an amazing job. He put out fires that could've delayed our closing a few times and delivered more than promised.  We will definitely go back to First Option and Aaron again!!
5	Robert Ledbetter And the first option mortgage team are awesome they made the process of buying a new home a amazing experience they made everything so easy and enjoyable they are super professional and I would recommend them thanks rob for everything you put Chris and I in our dream home and we couldn't be happier
5	Rob Ledbetter and First Option was one of the GREATEST times of my home buying life. Closing on time and got $ back from escrow.Highly recommend this Co.Thank You Rob...You Rock!.............................Love Ro and Sue DeAnda
