5	I've had the privilege of working with Joy on numerous occasions--most often for magazine fashion editorials.  She's definitely one of the top MU Artists in town. She's creative, has great taste, and has a ton of techniques at her disposal. I've seen her do makeup on her feet for six hours straight and no matter what the quality of her work is always, well...flawless.
4	I've had the opportunity to see Joy's work in magazines and on the runway so it was a true...well joy...to have her do my makeup for an event. She made me look natural with a POP! I am used to minimal makeup but she made me feel comfortable with a bit more coverage. I am comfortable with color in my clothes but I had to get used to it on my face. She gave me a pink lip that took me out my comfort zone but isn't that what makeup is about...trying new things and seeing what becomes your favorite look(s)? I had a great experience with Joy and can't wait to work with her again.
5	Joy did make-up for my wedding and everyone looked fabulous! I don't usually wear make-up, so it was important for me to look like myself. Joy did a great job of highlighting my best features without taking away from my natural beauty. In addition my make-up didn't smear or streak despite the rain and my tears! Thank you Joy, I appreciate it!
1	I have met this MUA in the N Lake mall, I thought she was very impersonable. I later had a friend that tried to book her for a make up class and she confirmed that she was unprofessional and I will never recommend her again. Beware and do you research
