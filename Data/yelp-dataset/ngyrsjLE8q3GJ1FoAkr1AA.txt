5	Stopped by here on the way to a different furniture store.  We were greeted with a smile and a warm, genuine greeting.  The shop is small, but quality items ( they are across from Leisure World retirement community) at amazing prices.  If you ask, they will take you to the 'warehouse' next door.  We left with two great pieces of furniture for less than the one we were going to look at!  My husband and I will return here often.
5	Amazing collection of antique! My husband and I would come here  again. The owners are very nice and helpful! It's a must see place!
5	This is an awesome consignment store! I stop by consignment stores often, and this one  has real realistic prices,is clean and has very nice owner!BTW - ask about the building next-door; (if they have not expanded yet! )I don't know why they don't mention it in advance and sell more- I brought up a certain color couch, then the owner opened up a whole another building full of stuff!I plan on frequenting this one! :-) Happy hunting!
