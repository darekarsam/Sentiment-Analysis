4	I've lived in Pittsburgh for 20 years and JUST discovered St. Anthony's Chapel.   A friend of mine was visiting from NYC and, though not at all religious, he's an antiques and history freak.  He discovered SAC and urged us to take him there.This is home to the largest collection of relics open to the public in the world and to a life-sized version of statuary of the Stations of the Cross.  The experience is breathtaking.   The tour guides -- free tours Sat through Thu at 1, 2, and 3pm -- are extremely knowledgeable and open to any and all questions.We were just blown away by the rich history and beauty of the place plunked down in the middle of a rather ordinary corner of the North Side.If you have guests in town looking for something out of the ordinary or if you've never been, it's well worth the schlep.
5	My wife and I have visited St. Anthony's Chapel three time so far and every time the experience is a moving one.  I would recommend the guided tour.  The amount of relics contained in the chapel is amazing.  If you a person of faith this is a wonderful place.
1	I was raised Catholic (but no longer practice), and have always been fascinated by relics and the stories of saints--so I was really looking forward to our tour of St Anthony's. BEWARE: I can't speak for their other guides, but the gentleman (a lay person, not a priest) who "led" ours was far more interested in haranguing the crowd on the nature of TRUE believers, the infallibility of the Catholic faith, and whether we'd all found our "charisms" - the gifts we needed to be using if we were going to be saints, too--than showing us any relics. After an hour of his sermon--and nary a single fact about the hundreds of relics that surrounded us--we left. What a disappointment. What a huckster.
