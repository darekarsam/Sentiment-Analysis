5	I took my wedding ring in to have it checked for a loose stone. This ring is not only valuable for the obvious reasons but extremely valuable for sentimental reasons. I am very weary of just anyone caring for it. The first time I went in I was greeted in a kind & friendly manner. The woman who assisted me knew why it was special w/out my even having to explain. She looked at it, felt she saw the issue but had another woman come check it as well. They were both extremely knowledgeable and considerate. They knew what needed to be done to secure the stone in a more stable way but just to be sure asked me to come back when the jeweler was in. I returned to see the jeweler who was also fantastic! He listened to my concerns, checked my ring thoroughly and was able to fix the ring right then and there! They also did it without charge! I am so grateful to have found this jewelry store, I highly recommend it and will definitely return in the future.
4	E D Marshall Jewelers is the absolute best. I have always been treated great and got a fair price. I would absolutely recomend using E D Marshall Jewelers  if you need to pawn or sell.
