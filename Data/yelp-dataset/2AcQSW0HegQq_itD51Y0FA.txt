5	Nice little neighborhood water store that you can access 24 hours a day! Delicious water, affordable ($2 for 5 gallons) and they even have dedicated parking... Not that it's ever an issue, but a very courteous bonus.Never been inside, so the outside is all I can review!
5	I LOVE THIS STORE! I believe the owner has been there 20 years. She is very nice and fills the water for you. I use her water ONLY for my fish aquariums. Pecos Windmill Water store is locally owned and operated!  Awesome!!
5	I am getting my water here. I love the 24 hour option and is only $2. I recommend this place.
