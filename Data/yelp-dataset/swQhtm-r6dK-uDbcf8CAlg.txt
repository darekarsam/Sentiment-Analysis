4	It is your classic Walgreen. Nothing special but they have a nice variety of medicines, supplies, electronic, and food.The people working there are very cool and they help y a lot!
1	The manager Amy Walter on 407 E Green Street in Champaign, IL is horrible. I bought an HP ink the day before but the ink can't print, I went to the store to ask for returning and she slandered me, saying I took my old one there. I don't think I will sell my integrity for a 20 bucks ink. Ridiculous mean!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4	Clean, well lit, it's a walgreens.Staff was friendly and they had what we needed.
