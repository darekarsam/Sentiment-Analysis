4	I get a double double every time I go to the West.  I highly recommend it with grilled onions!
5	I needed to do a little Christmas shopping and the ladies here were absolutely awesome!! They had most of the stuff I needed without making it too obvious for the person I was buying the stuff for. (Couldn't leave him at home... haha..)I would totally come back here because the prices are reasonable and the customer service is wayyyyyyy over the top for me!!! Good job In-N-Out team!!!
