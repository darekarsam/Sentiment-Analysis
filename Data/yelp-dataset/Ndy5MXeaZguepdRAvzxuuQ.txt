5	This Twice as nice is clean, new and full of things!  It's probably the nicest thrift store I've been in AND you have 2 weeks to return items if they don't work out AND they give store credit for donations.  The ladies had actual conversations with me, more than just "can I help you?"  I'll be going back for sure.  Oh, and the prices are GREAT.  (Ex. $1.99 for most of the kids clothes I looked at).  The most I spent on anything there was a shirt for 6.99
4	I like this place... My daughter dragged- me in and we became ONE ... diggin' n smell in' !Mgmt wasn't so customer friendly though... Slammin' things and doors around...overall good store to find trendy and vintage looks!
1	The lady at the purchasing counter is really rude to customers.  I heard her treat a lady very disrespectful then proceeded to yell at her across the store. The poor lady probably left crying. Not to mention she dressed like a hooker. Who dresses for work like that? Shredded shirt with her bra hanging out. Too many of the clothes are out of date and over priced. Its hard to find good stuff. Of course if that mean lady does all of the purchasing for the store and treats her customers that way im not surprised the quality is so bad.
1	Worse place ever, store is messy and short staff. The ladies at the counter can't calculate time, 20 mins turned into over 2hrs and still not done. I ended up taking my stuff because it wasn't even half way done. Don't waste your time!!!
