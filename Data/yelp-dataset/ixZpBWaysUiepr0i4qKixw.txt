3	I found the Fractured Prune while nosing around online from California.  I am visiting NC for the holidays and I just had to try it once I got out here. The idea was just too intriguing.Donuts are a little small but warm which is nice...We ordered a variety.. including lemonade, strawberry shortcake, french toast, trail mix, creamsicle... and more.   See online for the menu and what each of these consists of.  The toppings are really WAY too tooth-achingly sweet for me but I do see the merit in the dip to order format.  It's a lot of fun.  My 4 year old nieces LOVED it...as did my mother and sister.We also ordered some egg sandwiches to start since none of us had eaten breakfast (before the nieces early morning preschool holiday program) and truthfully they left something to be desired.  My egg and cheese on rye was pre-fabbed and not very tasty... as was my dad's egg, sausage and cheese on rye.  The (slight) exception was my mom's "breakfast club sandwich" on a bagel, which was piled high with HUGE amounts of thin sliced ham and bacon on top of the (rather pre-fabbed) egg.  It was pretty obnoxious and enough for two people... but tasty.Secretly I do want to try the donut breakfast sandwich, with egg and sausage.  Argh.  Imagine the salty sweet goodness...     but I'm not gonna go there...for fear of my girlish figure.So I guess the bottom line here is that the thing to stick with is the donuts, for a silly treat, and not the breakfast sandwiches.   Though we did not try the lunch sandwiches, so I can't comment on those. The service was nice. Everyone is very friendly. Kudos to them.I was good with one run but if you have a MAJOR sweet tooth, this is the donut shop for you.
5	I loved this place! They make the donuts fresh right in front of you. I picked a few like the Strawberry Shortcake and Banana Nut one, but I made my own too. WOW all the glazes and toppings, YUM! I dont think the glaze is too sweet either.......its glaze hello! Definitely stop in there!
