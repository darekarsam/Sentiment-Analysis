5	I highly recommend Ati (owner) at 3 PXL Photography as your Wedding Photographer. His warm and professional personality helps camera shy people to loose themselves in the joy of being in focus. He also knows the best locations to have your beautiful pictures taken. He and his assistant exceeded our expectations with his quality of work!
5	Ati did my Christmas family photos this year. They turned out great. I highly recommend him. He is extremely helpful and he was engaging with my whole family during the session.
5	Words cannot fully describe how delighted and impressed I am with Ati's work. I hired him for my wedding photos on 22 December and I am totally overwhelmed with the work he did for me!Booking an appointment from London with Ati was easy via email, and he was always very quick to get back to me with any queries. On the big day, he met me on time and ready with all his equipment and was extremely helpful when it came to maximising the time we had.When disaster struck and my cake didn't arrive at the ceremony, he was an absolute gentleman while my new husband went off to chase it up, and he ended up staying way past his allotted time just in order to finish the pictures he wanted to take of us.Ati went out of his way for us in so many ways - not least by bringing me my photo CD to the hotel door as I was headed to the airport! - and even offered my very sick mother a lift to the medical room so that she would not miss her flight. Ati is an amazing guy - his photos are beautiful and you will not find better than him in Las Vegas.Thank you, Ati! You made our day!
