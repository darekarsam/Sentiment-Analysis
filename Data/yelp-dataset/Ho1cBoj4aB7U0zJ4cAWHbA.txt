5	Killer tortillas for great price ! Get the 15" 50oz tortillas for the double wrap on your burritos.
5	Hands down my favorite tortillas ever. Soo delicious the food there is great too. I get some of the pork and rice and a bag of tortillas.  Booom I got a great meal. I'm drooling  thinking about this place again
1	Please people disregard the first four reviews. I wish I had,, what this place is, ishands down the crappiest tortillas I ever had. I think at one time they made very decent ones from the reviews. I dont think these people are not aware of what they eat. I purchased some today and they aren't good enough for hungry dogs. If u warm them up WOW they turn into a hard crumb making mess. Chicharones are okay a little salty but good. As far as sweet breads I did not buy, but they looked tasty. Drive as far as you have to to find Carolina's Restaurant there are a few in town now.
