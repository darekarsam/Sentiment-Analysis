4	Great little find on 5pm.com for good deal on champagne afternoon tea.Feels like this place has just been refurbished. Really polite staff and nice atmosphere.  Check out my many pictures of our champagne afternoon tea. We started with olives, antipasti and warm bread. Next was a cake stand of sandwiches followed by scones and cake.  Great choice of jams, marmalade and a nice surprise of cream cheese and figs. Nicely styled place and I would certainly recommend it.
