1	This place sucks.  They charged my wife and I for services that our insurance covered that they said wasn't covered.  We called our insurance and were told that not only did they charge us, they also charged our insurance.  We called and complained so we got our money back.  When we went back in to receive our refund, they were very cold and rude.  I can imagine that they double bill their other patients but have not been caught too many times.  If you had the misfortune of doing business with these people then I recommend that you carefully look over your charges to make sure you weren't ripped off.
5	I have been going to Dr. Dadej for 5 years now.  I have found him very professional and helpful.  His office staff have always been very patient and helpful also.  His new office on No. Durango is gorgeous.
3	I showed up early , paid my fees, they quoted me, I was content.  I received a call that they had given me a wrong quote and that I need to come back and pay 10% more that the original price. I refused to pay them so they did nothing but offer a refund on the amount for the frame and the anti glare. I just can't believe that this place conducts their business in such a manner. :(.The doctor was great. I will give him that! Why not rectify the situation. My only 2 options that day were.1.) Refund  (partial amount only)2.) suck it up and pay for someone else's mistakes
4	The doctor is excellent; I got the best glasses I have ever worn. The staff are friendly and competent and caring. I would have given them 5 stars, except I don't like the fact that they're not open on Mondays, which is a terrible inconvenience for me to pick up or repair glasses. Also, I got frameless glasses from this office, which were very expensive (I highly recommend them...they're awesome), but when I broke them, they did not have a way to repair them; neither could they even recommend a company that would repair them. I found this strange and again, quite inconvenient.
