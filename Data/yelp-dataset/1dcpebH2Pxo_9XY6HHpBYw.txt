4	DW was desperate to go to a Canadian Wal-Mart so we take the car out of the parking Garage (first mistake), drive nearly an hour through traffic only to find out that Wal-Mart apparently closes sometime before 8:15PM on a Sat. night.  While we're out in the burbs we thought we'd find a place to grab some dinner (second mistake).  After driving around for nearly two hours we end up a block from our hotel nearly 10pm at night @ Guido and Angelina's.  It was nice and quiet and we were seated quickly.  I had the Penne Romanoff (kinda like Penne in Vodka Sauce) and DW had Tortellini gigi al cardinale (meat tortellini in rose sauce).  The bread was really good, fresh and warm.  The service was super fast, almost too fast as if the food was already prepared and just warmed in the oven.  This is why I took a star off.  Otherwise we were extremely happy with our meal and only wish we had saved ourselves the time of driving aimlessly around Montreal for no apparent reason.
3	Nice staff, however the menu is a little disappointing. Would be nice if there was more variety than the standard Italian fair.
2	Very average. We go when we have group stuff for work cuz they give 20% off to our workplace. Otherwise I would not go. Prices for lunch are decent, especially with the discount. Outdoor seating is a plus. Wine's I've tried are so-so. Pasta is sometimes overcooked or globby sauces. Salad I tried was sub-par. Burger is okay.
3	Update - The restaurant is closed as the windows are covered with orange plastic wrap. I have been told (rumor) that the space will either be converted to a food court, or that a Jack Astor's is moving in.
4	Used to spend New Years with the family before they closed down. Too bad, I used to like this place!
