4	I came to Om for a facial that I purchased off of Living Social.  The place is set-up really nice and it's a cozy atmosphere.  The staff was friendly and accomadating and I had a great facial.  If you book your next service during your current visit you receive $20 off which is a really nice perk.
5	Excellent care when visiting Om Spa.  Awesome front desk staff. Wonderful and intelligent doctor.  Very easy on the eyes :-) but super professional.  I would recommend this place to everyone.  Feels a little like Heaven when you walk in here.
5	Great staff and awesome services. Dr Edmiston is a very knowledgeable chiropractor, he will give you lots of information and make you feel comfortable. I have been going to Om Spa for a year and have never been disappointed. I've had facials, many massages and lots of chiro visits. Ask the staff to check and see if your insurance covers a free massage with a chiropractic visit. Ohh and by the way, they sell Aveda products!
5	This little converted house hides an amazing secret!When you step inside it's so peaceful and calm. Upstairs they have a sitting area with tea and water, very relaxing lighting and music - they have a nice little sauna that you can use before or after your massage and the massage services are awesome. I was so relaxed I almost went to sleep.I am definitely going to become a member and go every month. You get a cost break when you become a member, so if you plan to come each month, it is the best deal!
