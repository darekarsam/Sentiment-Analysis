5	This swap meet is great and air conditioned.  Everyone is friendly and the place is clean!  They have a lot of nice services and it feels like an actual mall inside.  It is to my understanding that it is a former Smith's because the nearby Mariana's put it out of business, lol.  I do think, however, that there are too many booths with quinceanera dresses.
4	This is as close as I'm gonna get to Santee Alley without driving 4 hours to LA.......SO, I'LL TAKE IT!!!!!!Got some NYX makeup, hair accessories, tights, socks...and most were $1-$5. Great deal for everyday products that you find at a higher price at regular stores.They even have a restaurant in there. And a few spots that do alterations for cheap!I'd carry cash though bcuz most of the vendors don't take credit cards.
1	This swap meet no longer exists! Was very disappointed when I went looking for it only to discover that it had been turned into a Mariana's Super Market. There is one further up the street on Bonanza and Owens but that location had so little stalls that I don't believe that it can be called a "true" swap meet.
