5	Family owned, friendly, and always on time! Charles gave me a great price on my blinds and came out to measure around my schedule. He kept me informed throughout the process and did a great job on the installation. He cleaned up like he was never there and always came on time (which I've found is rare). I would highly recommend using Blind Installers of NC!
5	Just moved into a new house. I needed some new blinds but didn't want to get the cheap plastic type. A co-worker recommended Blinds Installers of NC and I was impressed with the product and price! Highly recommend.
