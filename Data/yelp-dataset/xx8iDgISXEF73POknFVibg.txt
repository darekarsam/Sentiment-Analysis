1	Have Terminix Termite and Pest Control.Noticed a problem with termites and called.  No one answered phone - went to voice mail.  No call back.Called next day and operator just took message.  Said could not schedule an appointment.Called again on third day and was told that someone would get back to me withing another 72 hours.This is now 4th day and no call back.  No appointment.  NO SERVICE.
1	I called and set up an appointment with Terminex two weeks in advance. I exchanged multiple texts with Dave S. confirming my appointment time for 1 p.m. on a Saturday. The next day I waited and he never showed up. He never responded to my multiple calls and texts. About 6 hours later I got a call from Joe, who said that he was the rep for my area and would I like to schedule an appointment. Although I was very unhappy with the company, I agreed. When he came for the appointment, he gave me a bid that was absolutely, unbelievably high (more than three times higher than the other companies I subsequently contacted, for far less work, and a much shorter warranty). There are many other contractors for termite control that are reasonable,  but this company is just a racket.
1	Worst service ever. Called and spent an hour setting up a treatment appointment. They never showed. I called them to follow up and they had no record of my file, much less my appointment and said they would call me back. They never called me back. I called again and they couldn't fit me in for another time for the rest of the week. I called again the following week to confirm a new appointment and they raised the price. I asked to talk to a manager and they kept me waiting on the line for 15 minutes and told me they would call me back and never did. I've use their service for my house in CA and it is great. Not sure what is going on with the branch here but I won't be using them, not that I could even get them here if I tried.
