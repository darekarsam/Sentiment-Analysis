4	If you're looking for a slice of REAL French baking in Montreal, look no further than L'Amour du Pain!Seriously delicious croissants, bread, cakes and sandwiches, this place has it all.  They even bake the small trinkets into some of their pastries to see who king/queen of the day will be.Packed with locals, come sleet or snow or rain, it is always always worth the trip.  You can take out for lunch, but the menu is more extensive if you take the time to sit down and enjoy a soup with your sandwich, dessert, etc.You may have a little difficulty ordering if you don't speak french, but they generally have someone that can help you out.They always have an extensive list of local cheeses that you can pair with their plethora of breads.Their cakes are fantastic (albeit expensive), one of them being a literal deconstruction of the Ferrer Roche truffles (in my opinion).  Certainly the go to bakery for a special occasion celebration!
