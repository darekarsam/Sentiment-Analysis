5	The woman who runs the shop is this adorable little Asian lady who is always friendly and chats with her customers.  The service is good-- and if you bring it in before a certain time (sorry, I forgot the exact time) the service is next-day.  Prices are about average. All my clothes have come out clean, fresh and neatly pressed. No problems. BONUS: Selwyn Cleaners is right next to my fave shoe repair, Dean's, making this a super convenient stop.  Then you can cut down Brandywine to hit Park Road Shopping center. Super convenient.
5	Fantastic service! The prices are at or better than what you would expect to pay at any QUALITY dry cleaner. The dry cleaning, finishing, and tailoring are top notch! The staff is exceptional as well. We were pressed for time and needed something cleaned and pressed within a few hours and they bent over backwards and got it done... NO extra cost. SUPERB!
1	These owners don't care about any of their customers. When you have a complaint, you get the deer in headlights look. They shrank all of my polo shirts and the woman couldn't have cared less. My wife showed up at 3:55pm the other day and the sign said "open" and the door was unlocked. She walked in and they told her they were closed and asked her to leave!! Needless to say we will never be back!
