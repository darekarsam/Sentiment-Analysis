4	Oh Crystal Lake.  I live three blocks from you, and you are now my morning method of alleviating early morning guilt over carbs.  My morning ritual involves running from my house around the confines of the Crystal Lake itself, a decent-sized lake that is somehow a bit less impressive up close and personal.  Also because it's not so much crystal as greenish, but Jade Lake was probably taken.The park has decent picnic areas, a playground, a Lakehouse (that i believe does NOT contain either Keanu Reeves OR Sandra Bullock), what appears to be a never-used Pool facility, and even some barbecue grilling areas.  Huzzah.  Instant fun for the whole family.It's also apparently Urbana's oldest park, first developed in 1907.  It's a great spot for a nice run, and I imagine if you're the dog-walking sort, you'd also find it quite useful for all of your canine caretaker needs.  If you're a sadistic sort, you can also watch the Teej huffing and puffing early in the morning, trying to get his run on.  Clearly Crystal Lake Park offers something for everyone.
5	i looove this park, right across the street from my grandparents house. The lake where they have the rubber duck races, the huge hills, and the boats you peddle with your feet..it's just an all around great park and very peaceful!
2	Pretty small and filled with geese poop.The water looks dirty.Still came here just to take a walk because its the closet to my house.
