5	This branch of French Connection is as good as it gets. The staff are really friendly - there is always someone at the door to greet you, no matter how busy it is, which I think is a nice touch.All their clothes are presented in a really manageable way and if you need anything then they are pouring over themselves to help -  one of the assistants helped me fix my bag once. The ground floor has all the womenswear and the first floor is the mens. The only thing that might put people off this particular branch is the fact that the downstairs fitting rooms are communal, so if you don't mind stripping off infront of strangers then it's fine. Otherwise there's a bigger changing room upstairs, complete with lockable doors.
5	Like the other reviewers, I completely agree that this is an excellent branch of French Connection. Brightly lit, well stocked and friendly staff. I don't know what they do with the displays but as well as being drawn to my usual styles I'm always drawn to outfits I'd never usually go for and want the matching belt and handbag too. Nestled on George Street it fits with the other shops in this area perfectly. I love French Connection, in particular their dresses and it's one of my favourite places to go for a good browse.
