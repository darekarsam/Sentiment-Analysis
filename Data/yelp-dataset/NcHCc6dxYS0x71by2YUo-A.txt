2	I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I've definitely had better, and yes, I've been here more than once! The service is ok, the pies are overrated, and the coffee, well let's just say you can find the same thing basically anywhere. In other words NOTHING SPECIAL/NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT! Also, the cashier that was there tonight....let's just say, she must be related to the owner, cause with her attitude, there's no benefit to keeping such an individual on staff. In a nutshell don't bother going here, there are better places with better service that comes with a smile to spend your money on and this isn't one of them!
4	Cheese cakes are amazing, great place before or after a movie for coffee & dessert.  However service tends to be very slow! My favourite cheese cake is the strawberry cheesecake!
