5	Granite Computer Solutions provides affordable, comprehensive and fast service. I love the new office in Tempe.Currently using their cloud image backup  service which puts me at ease about data loss. While my business hasn't needed to recover anything, I know if we do, we're covered. They have also taken care of basic hardware issues.I highly recommend for small businesses that can't afford (or don't need) dedicated IT staff but have recurring IT needs.
