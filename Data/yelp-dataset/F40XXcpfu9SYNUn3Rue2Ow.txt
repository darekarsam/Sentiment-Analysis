5	This location recently opened and is quickly becoming my favorite wine shop. My girlfriend and I recently stumbled upon this store on Rainbow while driving home and we decided to stop and take a look. Although not as big as other liquor stores in Vegas, this place offers a pretty good selection of wines and spirits at reasonable prices. It is worth mentioning the store clerk/manager Steve is an amazing and courteous gentleman. I am a newbie in the wine scene and he has no issues answering all my questions and making some really good recommendations. Since my first visit, Steve has introduced me to Malbec wine from Argentina, Chenin Blanc, and most recently, a Riesling from Oklahoma (I am yet to taste it)... he has even gone above and beyond in trying to get a wine I am looking for and said he'll talk to his district supervisor to try and get it. What a nice guy!This place is open from 8am to 11:50pm, so if you are in a crunch to get some wine just drop by this place!
3	I've been to the Liquor Outlet twice now, to pick up a couple small bottles of fun before an outing or two.The store is clean, the prices are decent, and the guy behind the counter is really cool.Its a little out of the way for me to shop here regularly, but I'll stop in if I need something on this side of town.  :)
2	Some of the employees are ok but John is so creepy! I went in there tonight and he wasn't even working and was clearly wasted. I get that he wasn't on the clock but I don't think it's very appropriate to hang out where you work drunk bothering everyone. He makes my skin crawl and is so disrespectful. He openly stares, is over the top obnoxious and really weird. At least their prices are cheap.
