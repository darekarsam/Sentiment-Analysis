3	With only two petite sofas and a single low lying wooden table to rest your brew on, Lazy Latte has minimal space. But, as I found, if your lucky enough to bag one of the sofas and settle down with one of their customer donated books, you'll be in for a relaxed and fuss free read.They do a hearty selection of sandwiches and soups, all of which are fine for a lunch snack but not worth shouting about.
3	Layzee service, Layzee cooking but Layzee prices.You'll waiter forever for you're coffee and your sandwich, the staff won't talk to you (infact nobody talks in here at all which is spooky). But you won't be charged much for it either, which evens it out drastically.Like Sam said, just ok.
