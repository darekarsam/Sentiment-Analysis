1	I typically visit this McDonald's and am a regular due to the Playland, my daughter and the Arizona heat. As of late, they have been completely lacking in the Customer Service end. My latest visit left me quite displeased. I waited 15 mins for my order and when it finally was ready, my frys were  missing. After pointing out the issue, I had to wait an additional 5 minutes. I got over it, big deal. But then my daughter asks me for an icecream cone so I go to order. As I approach the register another patron enters and is behind me. When this happens the manager and employee completely overlook me standing there placing my order and service the patron after me. At this point I am shocked and appauled. I decide to express my frustration to the assistant manager who offer me a very lackluster apology. Avoid this place if you can help it.
1	This location has the most incompetent workers I've ever witnessed. I live within walking distance, so it's an easy stop when I want some quick food - I've been here a lot. I'm not exaggerating when I say I have NEVER received my correct order the first time. Last week I went through the drive-thru and ordered 2 large shakes - one chocolate, one strawberry. That's it. I got 2 pumpkin shakes. Are you kidding me?! It was the easiest order ever, and was even correct on the receipt. Safe to say I will NEVER come here again and will tell everyone I know how nasty this place is.
1	Avoid at all costs. Order accuracy is nonexistent. Spent 10 minutes waiting for drive-thru order that was all wrong. Watched two customers ahead of me have the same issue. If you want a mystery order, try the drive-thru!
1	You guy are fast food?You just win one star for bing so slow food 14 minute for one small order
