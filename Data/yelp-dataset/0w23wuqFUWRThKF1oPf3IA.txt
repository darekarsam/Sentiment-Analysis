5	Brian and everyone at ATG were fantastic to work with, and they went above and beyond to make my unique reception absolutely amazing. Having a multicultural wedding meant that finding the right DJ/MC was probably my biggest challenge. It was imperative to me to have a certain blend of different music styles, from oldies to salsa and everything in between, and Brian went above and beyond to make sure that every detail was perfect. He spent extra time learning how to pronounce some of the more difficult names perfectly and worked hard to create a truly personalized musical experience for us. All sides of my family felt right at home, even those that came from abroad. In the end, my husband and I skipped our exit. Instead, we stayed and danced until the very last song.
