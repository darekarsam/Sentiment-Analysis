4	I've been here several times and it changes and grows more and more. There are alot of business that are there. This place has been around for years.They have a beauty supply shop with wigs, a furniture store, tons of clothes, boots, shoes, jewelry, a Mexican food place that's always busy and a smaller food vendor upfront, a lace wig store http://modellacewigsandhair.com. Tattoo shop: Eastside Tattoo. A tire shop next door, aroma therapy sort of shop, massage healing place, toys, sunglasses, earrings, purses, beautiful dresses, toy store, bamboo plants, There's a blanket shop, lingerie, backpacks, suitcases, phone services, cell phone repair, just alot of stuff. It's worth checking out. I wouldn't say it's cheap...some items are it just depends...Great place if you need a unique gift for someone. I've never bargained or haggled on the prices here so I'm not sure.

I lived that there wasn't too many people and your not fighting to get through it cause I have a 2 yr old. We will definitely be visiting here again!!
