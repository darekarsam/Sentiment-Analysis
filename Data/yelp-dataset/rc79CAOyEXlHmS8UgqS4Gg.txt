4	I just started a baking class and we were told that we needed to get a chef's coat.  I heard someone mention a place on 15th st and Mcdowell and figured it couldn't hurt to check it out.  I am so glad that I did.  This is THE place to go if you are a uniformed professional.  You can get firefighter stuff, security stuff, scrubs, and culinary stuff.  They have a wide variety of everything and their prices are VERY fair.  In terms of chef coats, if you are interested, they carry a lot of colors, many styles, and many brands.  You can find something for as low as 15 bucks!  You really can't beat that for high quality uniforms.  Keep this place in mind if you need a uniform for work...or play.
4	Very helpful & accommodating! Went in for shoes & socks; left with a free pair of socks & an additional discount for my place of employment.  Will definitely return!
1	Beware, will try to sell you boots on sale that have sat around for years and degraded. I started my shift with a new pair of these boots and had to leave 1 hour into the shift after the boots blew out their soles and turned into moccasins. Had to leave work to buy a cheap pair to get me through. They should be throwing these boots away and are trying to make a buck. Someone could get hurt in these Will never shop here again. If you do risk shopping here, avoid the boots on the west wall, they can get you hurt.
