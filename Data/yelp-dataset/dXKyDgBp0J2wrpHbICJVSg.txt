3	Has anyone, EVER, left a UHaul so happy with their customer service that they wish they rented more trucks from them?  UG.Luckily I just went to have my propane refilled, which took, of course, way longer than it should have.I went in to pay and the line was already filled with happy customers 5 deep scowling and waiting for appointments.They are a necessary evil.  I can't say I've ever had a better experience with another truck rental place though.
5	Picked up a small trailer for a one week rental...took a little while b/c they were busy (a good sign in my book), and the service was very friendly. No issues dropping it off, and they were gracious when I was a little past their normal rental time. I'll def use them again
3	The staff's Service and customer service was excellent.  I just want to advise that 1 UBox does NOT move an entire 1 bedroom (small couch, queen bed, dresser, and coffee table). Also that your end total will be more than your quote due to things like insurance, truck and trailer you need to pick up and drop off ubox, and other small expenses I didn't calculate in like locks, etc. I had my 2 uboxes in storage for a couple of months and then shipped to another state in which all of my things where in perfect condition and arrived in 2 or 3 days which was amazing. Also, I used movinghelp.com, which uhaul suggested, and they where by far the best movers I've ever used.
