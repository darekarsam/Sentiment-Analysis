5	Bring your own wine! SAQ right across the road. Very, very friendly service.
3	Not fancy fine, but not bad at all, especially with the weekday $20 all you can eat option and the beloved magic of BYO. I love bringing my own and eating all I can! Avoid the Pad Thai, that's not what that's supposed to taste like, but the red curry veg and sesame beef were very tasty! The service was smiling, friendly and prompt and kept the clean plates and napkins coming, which is thoughtful in the all you can eat experience. The location is great, sitting in the window watching the ebb and flow from the countless BYO's on Duluth and St Denis. The bathrooms are just a tinch ghetto, but not terrifying.
4	This place is a solid 4 stars, and I look forward to coming back. Good value, nice variety, and great service.All up it ended costing us less than $30 per person, which for the amount and quality of food, was great value. It fits in the "cheap and cheerful" category for me. The decor was on the fancy side of things, but not over-the-top - it would be just as good for a date as a group of friends.I found the service here to be very good. The waiter told us to order what we wanted, and he would bring out enough for our group, and the quantities ended up being pretty much spot-on! I think there was a little bit left of each dish, but not enough to be wasteful, and nobody missed out on anything. I know it's a small thing, but they also brought out napkins while we were eating - nobody does that! As a messy (ie. MANLY) eater, I definitely appreciated it (and I'm sure my girlfriend did too, for her sake).As another reviewer mentioned; this place is a BYOW, and there's a SAQ about 15m down the road, which makes it quick and easy to keep the bill down.
3	Good and cordial service, less expensive than AYCE sushi (ex. Sushi St-Denis). I recommend this a very decent all-you-can-eat place, especially since it is BYOW. I really recommend the ginger and shallots shrimp and the general tao.
