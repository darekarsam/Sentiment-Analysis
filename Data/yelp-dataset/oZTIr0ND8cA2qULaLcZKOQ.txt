2	I hail from the Netherlands, so to me:  this tram line is a joke. A very expensive one and unles they are going to expand the route it won't be worth it for a long while. The major negative points to me are: 1. It adds no improvement to travel time. 2. Congestion on Princes Street is a question of 'when' instead of 'if'.3. When up ahead the track something is wrong - there is no alternative than to wait in the tram. - as it is only ONE track no alternate routes can be considered. I am using it from Edinburgh Park to Westend - which is a fairly smooth uneventful ride. After that.. it is touch and go. Most of the time due to the other traffic using the tram lines as well this will end up in massive delays. - With other traffic I mean: cars, taxis,trucks, mopeds, bikes, pedestrians and emergency vehicles - ALL of them have right of use on this tram track.. sort it out Transport for Edinburgh..
