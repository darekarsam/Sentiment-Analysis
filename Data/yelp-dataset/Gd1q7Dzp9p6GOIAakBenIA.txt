3	I used to work for Specer Gifts when I was way young. Hehehe it's like a borderline porno store. I mean seriously - what made me laugh is people buy this stuff. Ok so yea I do! Spencer has inexpensive halloween stuff. Blacklights - stuff like that. That's way worth it! Christmas we had the grinch sandals....Sold for 19.99 a pair....Wow - that sold. I had to buy it on my employee discount. Spencer's is the place where you have "uhm friends" who you don't really know well and just wanna waste 20 bucks on. Yea. Normally this place is the way to go in finding Crap. But it's good crap!....Mostly....

I remember seeing a Edward Cullen snuggie here months  ago (she would have loved it!) so I was hoping they would still have it. Unfortunately they didn't have it but they had the next best thing an Edward Cullen Blanket. I asked for a gift box but the cashier said they only had a gift bag but it wouldn't be appropriate. I asked why and he whispered  "It says here's your (fbomb) Birthday gift". I was like oh okay. I love Spencers because they have off the wall gifts!
1	The manager Samantha is the most unprofessional person I have ever met in my life. She is unhelpful rude and a bitch. If they hired new management it would be a great store
