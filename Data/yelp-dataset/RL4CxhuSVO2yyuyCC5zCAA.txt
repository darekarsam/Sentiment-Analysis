4	Considering the fact that retail these jeans can run you in the neighborhood of $300-$400, the sale prices of $120 approximately was great.  I took my friend friend Germany there and she was in jean heaven.  I think she bought about 10 pairs.  I would go back.
5	Wow what customer service! I arrived and was warmly greeted by Angelo and Marcel.  I let them know what I was looking for and before I knew it, I had 3 selections to choose from!  I left happy with a new outfit that I LOVE!  The other two outfits I told them I will be back for and hopefully they will both be there again to help me leave feeling like a Million Bucks!  Thanks True Religion!
5	Totally love this store.  I bought a pair of True Religion jeans tonight.  The store was packed unexpectedly.  Was helped as soon as I walked through the door.  I explained exactly what I was looking for and the employee took me right to the section.  The store had relaxing music playing and was clean as expected.  They keep the fitting room locked and cleaned.  If you do decide to go be prepared to spend a little money.  I love the horseshoe of the brand.
