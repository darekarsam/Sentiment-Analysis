4	This location, although closed for awhile, reopened with new owners several months ago.  I don't ship things with them because of the extra they charge for the convenience.  They are very amenable, however, to receive packages that go out with the US Mail. After I do the postage printing at home, I take the shipping ready package to them.  I also buy some packing supplies from them.The staff is always very nice, cooperative, and will offer any help they can.
5	I went there several times lately. GREAT place for your business. People are friendly and professional. I was very happy with service and prices. The young man there spent 20 minutes serving my needs that cost 5 dollars. He was courteous and patient, I was amazed and grateful.I was really surprised when just minutes before that I was next door at H&R Block and they robbed me of 138 dollars for one page simple return that took 12 MINUTES to do. ESPECIALLY when I called in advance H&R Block and they quoted me 25 dollars then cheated me at the door.Great place POST NET and great service, KUDOS!!!
3	Since UPS took over Mailboxes etc that leaves Postnet for Fedex.  I had a manufacturer return package with tag ready to go and just dashed in, dropped it off, greeted by friendly staff and dashed out.  Simple and easy.
