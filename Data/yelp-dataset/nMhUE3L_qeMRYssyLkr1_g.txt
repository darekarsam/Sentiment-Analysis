4	Ivone was very knowledgable and helpful. She really had a great understanding of curly hair, as she was previously a hair stylist in Brazil. However, she didn't have much experience with ethnic hair, and the keratin deep conditioning treatment worked as well as if I put conditioner on my hair and let it sit. BUT she was a doll and very good at was she does, so I would recommend her to anyone that doesnt have ethnic hair. She did a great job on my roots (dye) and hair cut!
5	I wanted to get my hair colored w/ purple highlights and my friend recommended Ivonne.. I was hesitant at first because the last time I had my hair colored my hair was destroyed.. But my friend always got her colored all types of diff colors all the time by Ivonne and it always looked good.. So I went and she did an amazing job on my hair!! She was VERY knowledgeable about hair color treatment and how to maintain.. She was very patient with me and wasn't rushing even though we were running behind..  I definitely recommend Ivonne and will be coming back for a diff color!!
