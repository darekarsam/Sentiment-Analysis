1	Whatever you do, DO NOT use this storage facility!  The staff is a nightmare to work with and in the 2.5 years that we have used them, they have not once got our invoice correct.  We have had to go in person on numerous occasions to sort the issues out, which as you can imagine, is not ideal when in this day and age, we should be able to pay via phone/email/mail.  The staff are rude and completely unhelpful.
5	We recently moved to Charlotte and needed a place to store our belongings. Our U Haul representative worked with us and introduced us to Devon Storage. They were very friendly and efficient in getting us into a climate controlled storage unit. We appreciate the clean, password protected unit, knowing our belongings are well protected.
