4	Fresh baked bread, fresh cut ingredients. What more can you ask for in a sub shop. Very highly recommended Mom & Pop shop.
5	Great sub shop, been going here for years. New name but same great subs as always, highly recommended!
4	Great subs here. Just the smell of the bread is what hooked me.I WILL take this place over subway any day.Friendly staff and fast service.I hardly ever post reviews, but this place deserves your business.
5	I go to kind for carry out once a week.  The Subs are great (usually the Philly,  melt,  or roast beef). They never disappoint!
1	So the sign says NEW NAME SAME OWNERS. My opinion it should be new owners.I stopped in because it was near my office and I was craving a sub. The communication with the lady behind the counter was awkward and it seemed like they were doing me a favor by taking my order and were upset and a bit pushy that I was unaware of their ordering method. I was the only one ordering so I wasn't holding up the line, I placed my order and got my sub, I did not specify any condiments on my sub so all I got was meat and bread, I wasn't asked if I wanted either. In turn the sub was dry and chewy and with the prior service I figured it wasn't worth the effort to have them remake it.I won't be back.
