3	This Oakland dive bar is a haven for hospital staff just getting off of the night shift. At 7am people in scrubs line the bar and tables. The beer selection is alright (at least they have New Castle) and at 8am you can go over to the diner next door, order a (greasy) breakfast for $5 - bacon or sausage, eggs, hashbrowns and toast - and they will bring your order to you.It's a perfect place to go with some coworkers right after a night of hell.

3	First, I used to hang out at Chief's in the late 80s/early 90s, and it was because of the people rather than any product (unless one just couldn't let the day end without eating one of their ever-present, reddish-purple, pickled, hard-boiled eggs I've managed to avoid my entire life). The clientele, back then -whether in suits, leather, or ragged denim- were an eclectic bunch who were most likely considered "fringe" in some way.
5	No wifi... plenty of character.
