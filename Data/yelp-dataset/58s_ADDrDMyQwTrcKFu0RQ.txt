4	Reminds you of those old taverns, with a jukebox and pool table and your group of regulars who, in some cases anyway, look like they've been drinking all day. Perfect little place for a different kind of fun if you want to get away from the usual "hip" crowd.
4	Your experience of La Remise will really depend which day and what time you go: It's very calm the majority of the time - a quiet place to meet for a drink on a dark and rainy day with cheep beers, access to slot machines (if that is your thing) and a pool table. Thursday and Saturday nights are for karaoke and it becomes a different place all together - packed to the brim full of karaoke aficionados aged 18 to 85. The staff claims to have the largest karaoke selection available in the city  and the karaoke book is almost three inches thick  -filled with song choices in French and English. The atmosphere is loud and jovial which is entirely suiting for karaoke fun.If you love karaoke, and if you love a good dive bar, I would strongly recommend La Remise. Get there before 10 PM if you want to ensure a spot as often on Saturdays there is a line-up to get in.
