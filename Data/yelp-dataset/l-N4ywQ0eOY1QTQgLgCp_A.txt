4	I work in Monona and decided to stop here for a quick grocery run. It's pretty much what you'd expect. Produce section a little lacking & priced a little high. Pretty run of the mill.
3	Copps is alright, but they are expensive.  They have a nice selection of produce, but their meat prices are high.
3	Why do I shop here?  Coupons.  Yup, I live on a budget.  They have a great double coupon set up.  You can get amazing deals.  Now the down side?  There are not a wide offering of products.  Prices can be steep without a good sale or coupon.  They advertise items but they do not carry them.  Not to mention, most of the locations (this one included) do not carry swiss cheese.  How weird is that?  I can never find it in the prepackaged cheese department.  I have asked employees and they say most brands are not carried.  Weird.  The produce could be a little better for the price.  Otherwise, decent place.
2	It's Copps...East, West all the same. Poor selection, poor lighting,  bad layout and overpriced. Always has been and  always will be. I prefer Woodmans or Metro market.
