5	Great dentist.  He has done great work for me over the years and is always on top of everything making sure it is done right.  They also have the nicest staff of any place I know.
5	I have yet to meet anyone who says "I absolutely love going to the dentist!". It's one of those things you have to do...but with Dr. Sick, you may find that you actually enjoy your dental visits.To start, the staff is incredibly nice. Every. Single. One. Seriously, they are the sweetest, most well informed staff you will ever come across.When you arrive and get settled, they offer you a paraffin wax hand treatment to get you nice and relaxed. It's a really nice touch.The office is very up to date on all the best dental equipment and the clinic is spotless.Dr. Sick knows just about everything there is to know about dentistry and also happens to be one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. There is no fear of the dentist with him! He answers questions carefully and kindly and keeps you well informed during every dental procedure so there are no surprises.If you are looking for a dentist, don't hesitate to call and make an appointment. You can thank me later. :)
5	I've been coming to AZ Dental Design for more than 10 years. I originally went in to get my teeth cleaned and whitened but I knew my teeth needed more care. Dr. Todd and his staff have always been kind, courteous and very helpful with my family's dental needs. They always make the best recommendations even if it includes going outside their practice for more specialized care but their practice does such a great job. I definitely recommend them whenever anyone needs a dentist. I always hated going to the dentist but I haven't felt that way about AZ Dental Design. I know I am in good hands.
