5	All you need to know is that the owners (John & Brooke) are multiple-time Ironman finishers.  In other words, they get it.  They know what triathletes need and have put it together perfectly in this store.  Their product offering is extensive and they only staff the store with accomplished triathletes who also understand the sport.  In addition, they frequently host athletic education events and have started offering "meet and greets" with Matt Russell, a pro triathlete they sponsor. Finally, they're very charitable and donate a portion of their profits to various charities that they sponsor.  In short, there's really not much they could do better and I'm a huge fan!
5	Incredible customer service.  These guys bent over backwards to help me exchange a wetsuit. They even went so far as to call the owner of Desoto to make certain I had the correct size coming. You don't get that service online.
5	Hands down the best tri store in AZ. Brooke, the owner is patient, kind and so helpful to someone like me who is new to the sport! She is great at ordering product if you need something in your size, and up follow up is great. She also gives great tips and an honest opinion, which is rare in todays world. I can appreciate a locally owned small business and will continue to help support their store while they continue to support the local tri community.
5	The owners are extremely nice and knowledgable.  If you are a triathlete this is the place to go. Their prices are great too!
5	The owners of Destination Kona are extremely helpful and friendly. I have been using them for over a year now and will go nowhere else.  They are also very knowledgeable.  Thanks Brooke and John!
5	Great shop!  Staff is really helpful and informative and don't make you feel like a shlub for being a newbie.
