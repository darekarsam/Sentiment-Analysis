3	This place is deceptively spacious. From the street, it looks like a small little hole-in-the-wall coffee shop, but inside the room goes on and on! I've come to Le Placard a number of times, because it's the nearest place to my house that's guaranteed a cheap cup of coffee and an open electrical outlet for my laptop. That said, I don't love it here. The decor is quirky antique-store chic, which I love, but the large space is somehow overly impersonal. You get a feeling like you're really all alone in there. Hard to quantify, but there you go.The coffee is okay, often not as hot as I'd like, and the muffins were a little disappointing. I haven't been brave enough to try anything else on the menu. Service here is sort of crummy, though. It's like the place can't decide whether it's counter service or table service. They have you sit down and they come to take your order, but then good luck ever seeing a server again - not for a bill, not for a refill or a glass of water, not to ask if you want anything else. Which is too bad, because I'd like to hunker down and work in one place for a while, not wonder if I should go to the bar or try waving my arms frantically to get someone's attention.They use Ile sans fil wifi, which works most of the time, and there are plugs everywhere, so if you're going to work, you should be ok. And an article plastered to the front window boasts, "comme au bureau," so they sort of expect you to set up desk there. It's good enough for what it is, but unless it's crazy cold out, I prefer to walk a bit further for better.Also, cash only!
