4	This place is great! Delicious prepared foods, pastas and sandwiches. Gets pretty crowded at high noon, but the line moves quickly so don't be discouraged. Table turniver is equally quick.Roasted red peper farci with gnocchi and Brussels sprouts was delicious, as was eggplant parm. Not cheap though. $18 or thereabouts for lunch and cookie.
5	Not cheap but 1) delicious and 2) more authentic than most run-of-the-mill Old Montreal joints.
4	I want ALL THE SANDWICHES at this place. I've tried a bunch of them, and they're all so good I would go back and get the same thing the next day. The salad serving sizes looked a bit on the small side (for my liking) so I stick with the sandwiches.It's also a deli, so you can pick up all kinds of pasta and pre-prepared (mostly Italian) goods.This place is popular with the business crowd, so it can get a decent line going around lunch time - even then it's never taken me too long to get in and out. There's some seating, but not a lot (and it's mostly small tables). If the weather's good, I grab it and walk two blocks (towards the river) and eat it in the park.
