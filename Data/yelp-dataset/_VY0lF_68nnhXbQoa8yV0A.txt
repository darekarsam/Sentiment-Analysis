5	As far as hi-rise living goes...this is how the other half live. I'm glad I get to spend time here often.  On-point security from the time you drive in all the way to the elevators and into the garages.  Big brother is watching and that's a good thing.  Elevator calls directly to your unit.  Freight elevator also available direct to the back of your unit from the underground garage which houses your personal garage with your own garage door opener.  Yes, a private garage within the underground garage...love that!  The units are spacious, well built and all have great views of the Strip and mountains.  Private wine cellar storage and tasting room in the lower level.  Amenities like no other place in town.
