5	Really love the attention shown to clients, making them feel at-ease. His sense of humor and easygoing attitude really bring out the subject's inner beauty and confidence. It makes for a very comfortable and enjoyable experience.Brad not only connects with the subject, his eye for light and the small details is fantastic. Aesthetically, his work is pleasing and compliments the model, rather than having the model try to conform to a cookie cutter template.Even though his modesty will not allow him to agree, his work is custom and well thought out.  He's quite genuine and his passion shows in all his work.
5	I have been modeling since I was 14 and have worked with many photographers over the years. I have to say that Brad Olson is one of my favorite photographers. I have shot with Brad several times over the last two years and always getting a impeccable result! Brad is professional, artistic and fun! Brad has a natural talent behind the camera and is always willing to try new styles and has a portfolio full of different styles of photography. If you are looking for an certain style...I'm sure he can nail it for you!  On a final note...Brad always makes you feel comfortable! This is important because you get better images that way!
5	Brad has been one of my favorite photographers to work with for the past year. He doesn't rush things, he pays attention to detail, and his skin editing is amazing. He is always open to new ideas and is a pleasure to work with. Very professional and always happy with the result at his shoots. Highly recommend.
