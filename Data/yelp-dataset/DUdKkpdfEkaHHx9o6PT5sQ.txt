4	Ok for hotel, rooms are ok, bathroom is ok, breakfast is fine. Friendly service. Nice building from the outside. But nothing too special.
4	I really don't have anything to compare this to so I would rather base my review on the entire adventure of Edinburgh and start by saying this hotel is what I expected the rooms were smaller in size than what one would expect at home but it was very well maintained and clean. The staff was very friendly and we never had any issues or anything to complaint about it was a place to rest and with the extremely long days because more than 18 hours of daylight it was comfortable.Downstairs there is a bar in the the lobby which is where I spent a lot of my free time waiting on the girls to get ready to go out and do something. The beer here was really the reason I never complained about the long waits it was exceptional and I indulged as often as I could. Over-all I liked this hotel and would stay here again, the location was very convenient and within walking distance to most of the sights in the city.
