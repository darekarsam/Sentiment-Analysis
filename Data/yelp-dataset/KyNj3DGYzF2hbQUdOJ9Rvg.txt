5	Taking Trainer Jo's H.I.I.T. (High Intensity Interval Training) Bootcamp at City Athletic Club has done wonders with my body. She's a positive fitness instructor and makes people push their limit because she knows we can do it. It can be a challenging class sometimes, but in the end the results are worth it.

I never wanted to join a Gym but after I took trainer Jo's boot camp at City Athletic Club I changed my mind and became a member! It is an intense interval cardio circuit training.that one I guarantee you will see the result fast if you really make a commitment to her!! I highly recommend her boot camp to anyone who wants to get in shape!!
