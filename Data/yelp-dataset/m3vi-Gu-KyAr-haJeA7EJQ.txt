5	I switched from the barber that I used for over 20 years to Jennifer's Evolve Salon and have never been happier with the results.  Great men's cuts and great product suggestions and offerings and reasonable prices.
5	I've been to salon after salon to get my hair done always leaving a tad dissatisfied but finally I've met the stylist/colorist who gets what I want and creates the most amazing trendy look that I absolutely love... People are always commenting on my hair and how they luv it. I am happy to give your business cards to anyone I see.
5	Last week my hairdresser really did a job on my hair. I had 4 or 5 different colors in my hair and he chopped it really bad. So I thought I would take a chance and make an appointment with Jennifer, to my amazement she worked magic on my hair. She  re colored my hair and did an amazing hair cut. She was an absolute doll very nice, funny and very professional. I finally found someone who knows how to ask you what you would like done and she does it even better. I would recommend her absolutely. Thanks. Sheri z
