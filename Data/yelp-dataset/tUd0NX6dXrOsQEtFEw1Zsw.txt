3	I so wanted to love this place, because I love Korean food so much and it's quite close to home.  On this particular day I was having an extreme bibimbap craving.  It was decent, but not memorable.  We also ordered some Kimchi (which my boyfriend hates paying for as many places offer it for free) and it was also was not very memorable.
3	Alright folks I liked this place but I have just not stumbled upon korean food that I adore. I really thought they did a decent job of what was brought to our table but overall I thought it was just moyen.
3	Mehh.. Not my favorite one, but the atmosphere is great.
3	This place has gone downhill since it opened. It's clear that they use the same marinated meats for various dishes, which clashes when you have the tofu stew (a spicy and savoury dish) with the same beef that had meat (sweetly) marinated for  bulgogi. Despite this, the pajeon is amazing and the yukhwe (Korean beef tartare) are a must try.
2	The food was OK (actually it was above average for Montreal Korean food). However, I need to give it only 2 stars because they CHARGE for side dishes! It's like an Italian restaurant charging you for bread and oil. It's like a Mexican restaurant charging for salsa sauce. It's like a Sushi restaurant charging for wasabe. It's like If you are a Korean restaurant YOU DO NOT CHARGE FOR SIDE DISHES!.
