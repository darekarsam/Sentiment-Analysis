5	How refreshing to find a nice, NORMAL full service car wash in Phoenix!  This place opened about a month ago, & I got around to trying them today.  The staff was friendly, the price ok, & they got my car nice & clean inside & out.  The biggie for me here was that these guys didn't hound me with upsells!  I was able go get the car wash I wanted, without having to argue with anyone.  Can you imagine?  The cashier was a little hottie, too!  What more could you ask?     :-))Full Service Car Wash $8.95, with a wide range of premium services & auto glass replacement also available.
1	Updated review: old ownership was great, new ownership isn't doing wellAfter countless 1/2 washes and 1/2 rinses on the right side of my vehicle I'm done w this place. Staff said it was a know issue but management refuses to fix. Suck this place was really good at one time.

5	Best place hands down I would recommend it to anyone no joke I go there my self 3or 4 times a week They have a super good deal which is u pay 24 bucks and u get one month of unlimited car washes and i recommend if u do get the membership get the 24 dollar one since a lot more is put in like WAX which is IMPORTANT they make ur car look brand new take my word for it They also have cheap 3 dollar wash which is alright but overall the membership best bang for u buck since going there 3 times in a month is already worth more than what u paid since they give u 10 dollar wash every time just for 24 bucks
