3	Reasonable place to go. Very laid back. Friendly crowd. Clientele is an interesting mix of Plateau hipsters and guys from Laval/South Shore (usually posted around the outskirts of the dancefloor). As a result, the last few times I've gone, the guy to girl ratio has been at least 3:1. Could just have been those particular nights though. Great for people watching and a general good time.
3	Interesting little place. It's smal,l but big enough to have a blast. They have a great bartender. I like the music, but... 1 song out of 5. They will play songs by the Cure, Talking Heads, The Cars, Joy Division, etc... The problem is that there is a team of DJ's in their early 20's trying to find the most obscure hits from the darker side of he 80's. Now I'm 38, I love this crap and I know this era very well... But these DJ's are out to prove something. Most people don't know anything they play. They play a great song, then 4 crappy songs nobody knows. You end up standing around waiting for the next great song. It's like the DJ's are blind and can't tell that the dance floor just cleared out. If they would cut this out I would give them 5* and probably 100$ a week!
5	My favorite local bar in Montreal. Thursday nights are my fave. Get a Tremblay at the bar ($5) everyone does.
5	I love this place, it's the best! Big PBRs and friendly people. Also off St-Laurent so you don't have to put up with a lot of the nonsense that goes on over there.
