4	The service was VERY friendly. I'm a woman So I always feel like im getting screwed over anyways but this was pretty good. Got oil change, brake and transmission fluids and a few other services and it was about $270 bucks. Mind you the truck hadn't has ANY service in 2 years so it probably needed it. The waiting area is very nice and they also give Military Discount :)
5	It was time for an oil change, and Goodyear advertised a synthetic blend oil change with filter for $20.  The business closed at 6:00 p.m. on this night, and they took my car at a little after 5:00 p.m.  They got the job done at the price advertised, and did not attempt to justify any added fees (well, the work was taxed, but who can avoid that?).  If you are wondering why I'm tossing up a 5-star for this...read the my prior review.  The contrast is astounding.
4	For the me, the service has always been great.  All the employees here have always been attentive and for once, not trying to rip you off.  I know how to work on cars and know when a mechanic or manager is trying to pull one on you.  Not this place.  In fact, I've been here twice where they fixed a flat without charging me a penny.  I will definitely be back the next time I need service for my car. Now for some facts...I have a company issued car meaning that all the service is paid by my company.  Also, any additional work needed is paid through by my company.  Not a bad deal for me so I can't begin to comment on the cost to get work done becauses I never have to pay out of pocket.  I am judging this place based on service and the fact that they never tell me I have something wrong when I don't.My only gripe is the waiting room.  Nice TV, but no cable or DirecTV.  I know, now I'm getting picky.  I had to find something wrong, right?
