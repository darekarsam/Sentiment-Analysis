5	Woohoo! is right!The hall just renovated the Royale Ballroom - and it looks WONDERFUL!LED lights, a glass bar, lights under the tables and shimmering crystals everywhere!  The best part is that all of this in included in one VERY reasonable price!  (during the off-season).The food is supposed to be great, with pages and pages of options!I can't wait to see it all come together on November 13th!  : )
5	I had my wedding at Buffet Roma as well as done a few client weddings here.  Mary & Tony always gives exceptional customer service.  Their food is amazing, especially their sweet table!  My guests are still talking about it after 5 years from my wedding.  Highly recommend.
5	We attended the NYE celebration as a group of 6 and it was fantastic we were seated in the royal ball room and the setup was great! 8 service meal 130$ with an open bar! Service was fantastic staff was kind and courteous and the general people we're very nice we had two couples at our table and we had a blast with them! We are going back next year! I'd recommend to anyone who is looking for a NY that's outside of the house parties and club scene the crowed is mixed and tables come in placements of 10 so 5 couples is ideal for a full table and tickets sell out fast. The music was off the hook and they gave out door prices and Gold star entertainment provided light sticks glow rings and other great party favors!
