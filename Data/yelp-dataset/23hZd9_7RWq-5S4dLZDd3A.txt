2	Prices are good . But as always take forever to get ck out . What really got me was that one of the manager saw us waiting in line for 10min and he saw it was getting longer . Then he Decided to do something about it. The way he handle himself in there was unprofessional. I know it's a flipping 99 store .
3	It's a dollar store! Don't expect too much. It is also the best dollar store in town. Okay the ONLY dollar store in town. I just wish they would carry my beverage of choice: Diet Arizona Green Tea. They have the full sugar version but no diet. Nice place to shop if you're on a budget.
5	If it wasn't for 99 cents only store our budget would be much tighter. Our families meals are typically vegetable based and I was blown away when I saw their selection. Now like any dollar store you never know what they will have but typically there is a good selection of fruit/vegetables and that is saving my family (of 5)  between $100 - $200 monthly. 99 cents only store has become the 1st stop for our grocery needs and they also have plenty of odds and ends. I would recommend anyone give them a chance.
2	I love the fact that Maricopa now has a dollar store, it was long over due. But there are issues with this location. They never have enough registers open to check people out making the wait too long. Another issue lately is their choice to put so many boxes of stock in the isles that you cannot get through very easily. If you plan on going give yourself extra time and have patience.
