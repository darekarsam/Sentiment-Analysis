3	The produce here is pretty shoddy.  The carts are pretty old, dirty and broken.  Most of them don't even have chlid restraints.  We ended up using one without any and just watching our daughter.Aside from that, the rest of the place is pretty normal.  I ended up throwing the broccoli away though.  So that was annoying.  I dunno if it is a Montreal thing but it's weird to me to have a grocery store attached to a shopping mall lol.
3	Very average grocery store. They have a limited selection of items despite their size (no marble cheese?) and the fruits and veggies are mediocre at best. Design wise, it's one note, but the prices are generally average or better. Still, be a smart shopper - they're not all good prices.One note though: when everyone started charging for plastic bags, IGA and others increased the quality of theirs. Super C did not. They suck.
