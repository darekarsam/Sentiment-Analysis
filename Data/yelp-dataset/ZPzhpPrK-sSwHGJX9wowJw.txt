5	Stan was extremely helpful and quite enjoyable to talk to so I will definitely go again when projects call for great tile specification!
4	This is a nice little tile store in the city, but being small, the selection is somewhat limited and requires flipping through samples which are partially hidden. This place is a bit on the higher end, so I would not go here if you are under a tight budget. Customer service was friendly, and the sales people were knowledgeable and professional.
1	Don't frequent this business unless you want to be treated very badly. I was subjected to the rudest, most passive aggresive behavior I have ever experienced. Alison made it clear that my job was too small for them to be bothered with, and I understood, but she was disrespectful about it. Fine. I left. Then an installer called to tell me she was sending him to my house. So I went in to choose tile, and Alison was impatient and angry. The installer came. Then I went back  to the store for a third time to buy the tile , only to be told "I should shop at Lowes". Why would a business drive customers away and then pull them back and then insult them and refuse to do business?  I told Alison she had a terrible attitude, and she said "I know".  Something is very wrong with this place!  The employees here should stand on their feet at Lowes for a day and learn to be polite to customers....shame on them!
