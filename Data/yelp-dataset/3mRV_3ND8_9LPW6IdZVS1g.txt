4	PT Allen Gruver (PT, ATC, PRC, CSCS) came highly recommended from a family friend - was extremely meticulous and thorough in diagnosis and treatment (knee/ITBS rehab). highly recommend for those looking for a skilled, reliable PT.
5	Both my wife and I have worked with these guys on numerous occasions and can't recommend them enough.  From ACL reconstruction to Rotator Cuff surgery as well as numerous running injuries, we keep coming back and are always very satisfied with their services.
5	I've been there 3 times over 4 years and they are a fantastic group of Therapists and assistants.  Rob, Allen, and Lindsay have helped me to recover from injuries where I thought I would not regain 100% functionality.  They are caring, thorough, and so capable in their diagnosis, treatment, and suggested home exercise plans.  Two of my daughters have been here for sports injuries in HS and they too were "cured".
