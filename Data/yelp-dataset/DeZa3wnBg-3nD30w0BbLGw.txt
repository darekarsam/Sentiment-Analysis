4	This is my favorite summer hot dog stand in the world! It's really nothing incredible, but there's just a pleasant feeling when I eat there. It's been there for 200 years and Monique is still there roaming around. Places like this are slowly dying off. Hot dogs, burgers, fries... What more do you want from a sunny July day:)
3	This is your typical greasy spoon place. A run down resto that has amazing hot dogs, fries and poutine. Not a classy place but a great spot for a quick bite.
4	Best ! Meilleure poutine! Been a fan since I'm 14 and its still the best damn fries cheese and gravy in and around the island  !!! keep doing what you're Doing Avec le beau service local Et genereux
