5	These guys are exceptional!! We shot a video in front of their store and inside! They were great to work with and the deli is tasty!! Definitely a great neighborhood mart
5	I wish there were more places like Ogden Mart here in Vegas. One of the things I miss about NY is the damn delis (or bodegas, even). I have yet to actually step inside this store, but I've ordered delivery a few times and the deli is solid. Well priced, too. I resort to Subway and its ilk out of pure necessity living here, but I just don't really get why people like those chain sandwich shops. Where I come from, they're for n00b transplants and tourists. Support your local businesses and enjoy your cold cuts freshly sliced! Ogden Deli beats Subway (Quiznos, Port of Subs, etc...) any day of the week.
2	I am not going to lie, the food is fresh. I ordered a build your own sandwich. I did not get what I wanted. I order meat and cheese with pickles, mayo, salt n pepper. I got meat and check with pickles, tomatoes, onions, salt and pepper. I HATE tomatoes and onions which is why I did not ask for them on there. I am not sure what they were reading cause I did not ask for those. My friend ordered one of their specialty sandwiches, hoping that she would get what was listed on there... nope, she definitely did not. We ordered together to get the free delivery. I would have rather paid for delivery then deal with what we dealt with. We ordered to our work, they said between 1255-105, they showed up early, which normally would be fine if we weren't working. The delivery woman was SOOOOOOO rude, huffing and puffing for having to wait, left and when I called back she was all "I called 6 times." um no you didn't. I tipped her too and she was still so rude. Told everyone and their moms how much she hates delivering to where we work. I just was so flabbergasted by their customer service. Not only was our food wrong, but rude people too. No thanks.
