4	They've got a smoothie bar here as well.  When I'm busy, and after my workout I'll roll by and pick up a post workout smoothie.Competitive prices of the supps vary.  I either buy here, GNC or at 24 hour fitness.  They'll either beat the price or come very close.  If they can't beat a price, they'll just be up front with you.Every time I've rolled by, the staff has been very knowledgeable and professional.  Needless to say, I frequent here when I'm low on my supply to stock up.
4	"Now serving the best tasting smoothies in town" .... Really??!!! Damn, they were not lying. I'm just visiting for the week and their smoothies have been the perfect treat after working out around the corner. Strawberry, banana, peanut butter protein shake w/ glutamine.....awesome!
