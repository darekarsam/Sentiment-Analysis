5	We started taking our first daughter here when she was born a little over 3 years ago.  We recently had another little girl who we also have seen here.  Dr. Ankrah is their primary doctor, but we've also seen Dr. Ball.  They are both wonderful.  Our 3 year old has always been excited to go to the doctor and always enjoys it (even when shots are involved).  In the hospital with our second, there was always a doctor from this practice in the hospital caring for our baby.  That was very nice because we didn't have to worry about information getting lost in translation.  Overall, every doctor from this practice that we've seen is just absolutely wonderful and we recommend all of our friends with little ones to them.
