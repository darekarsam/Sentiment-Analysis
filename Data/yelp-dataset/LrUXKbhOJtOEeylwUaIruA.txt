5	Great people, great price of only $10 for a haircut! Most guys will agree that it's hard to find a barber that can cut your hair just the way you like it. Well John, his wife, & his son can all do just that for an amazing price of just $10.  I will never go anywhere else.  These guys are great at what they do and they are very friendly.  But don't take my word on it, give it a try and experience for yourself.  It was my bro-in-law that recommended me to John and all the dudes in my family go to him for a haircut. lol
4	$10 hair cut and a nice massage to boot? You betcha. (Well, the owner's wife will run the machine on you for a couple of minutes after the haircut if you're lucky enough to have her do the cutting.)Nice people, but sometimes a little rough with the clippers like they're running a lathe on your head. Love the neck shave!This place is a hole-in-the-wall, but usually those are the best places to go to. Small place, small parking lot. It can be dicey getting back on to Monroe road depending on what direction you're headed afterwards.Your pal,Walter
5	I just got out of the military and moved to charlotte, so naturally I was looking for a good barber shop. I decided to give this shop a try. It was a weekday afternoon so it was very empty. The one guy there gave me my cut. Very nice, talked about sports and everything. Unfortunately I thought they would accept card, but they didn't and I had no cash. I offered to leave my ID so I could run and get some cash. The man refused and just told me to pay the next time I came in. I was taken aback at how nice and trustworthy he was, but I came back with cash 20 minutes later.Safe to say I'll be going back for my haircuts in the future.
