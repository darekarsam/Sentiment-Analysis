5	Today was my second stellar experience with Element Carpet Cleaning, so I know the excellent service I received the first time wasn't a fluke! I have been a homeowner for over 30 years and have never had carpets this clean before. I highly recommend Gary of Element Carpet Cleaning - he is prompt, reliable, pleasant, and does great work!
5	I have used Element Carpet Cleaning for a few years now. Gary is always professional, neat, on time, and my carpets look great!I recommend Gary for any floor cleaning needs.
5	We were so excited to receive a call from Gary! Gary and his father-in-law, Rick, used to clean our carpets every six months until Rick became ill. We didn't realize that Gary continued with the business, but we are now ecstatic that he found us again! Gary does an awesome job, our carpets look great again, and we are thrilled to support a small business owned by a friendly, honest, hard-working, family man! Gary, if we don't call you in six months, please call us!
5	I had Element clean my carpets and upholstery and they did an amazing job and were very reasonable.  I am a real estate agent and I would definitely recommend them to my clients.  Thanks Gary for a great job!!!
5	I cannot say enough about Element Carpet Cleaning! Why have been using them for years. Every stain from one of our kids or pets has always came out with their machine. Last year, we were renting and there was off white carpet in high traffic areas. We were worried about getting our rental deposit back if it didn't come clean. When we saw the amazing job Element did, it was no longer a concern. Our landlord stated, he couldn't believe how clean it was! Element does an awesome job on upholstery as well! So nice to have your couch looking brand new again :)
