2	Ran out of biscuits before the end of breakfast hours, and that's not cool.  Staff was reasonably polite about it though.  Quite a bit of riff-raff as far as customers go, but maybe that's just the area.  Ton of pepper in the eggs.  What the heck?
3	Get my order correct most times and my food is always hot.
1	What an odd and disappointing experience!I simply asked the cashier to confirm the contents of the Monterey Ranch Crispy Chicken Sandwich (I wanted to make sure that it didn't have any bacon) and I got a snippy, sarcastic, and just plain rude tone from the cashier.The food came out within a couple minutes, which probably accounts for the french fries being cold and stiff and the sandwiches having unmelted cheese.I can't remember when I've ever had such a bad experience at a Wendy's, but by the look of some other reviews as well, it looks like it's best to treat this branch as a poor exception to the norm.
3	Nice clean place;  can get busy at lunch; today I noticed some serious attitudes amounst the crew here.  They seem very apathetic;  this may point to a management issue with this location.
4	Just another fast food franchise. If you have eaten at any other Wendy's before then you know what all Wendy's taste like. It all comes down to cleanliness and customer service.  This is one of the few locations thy has been lucky to have not been remodeled, still the same layout of when I was a kid.   Employees at this location are nice and friendly. I have seen the same cashier lady for the last 3 years! That says a lot about a location specially since fast food had a high turnover.  Overall the quality of Wendy's has declined for my taste. Prices have increased and portion size has decreased. Buns aren't even warmed anymore like back in the day. If you are missing the taste of a Wendy's burger then this is the place to be, location Is clean and employees are friendly, we were the only ones in the place this evening so it was nice and quiet.
