5	For a decent haircut, wash, and shave, the value is excellent. Much better than going to one of the larger chains. It's owned by a family and they do an excellent job to ensure that you are satisfied with your haircut. The student haircuts are only $7, but they are supervised by the instructors so that your haircut is to your satisfaction. I especially enjoy getting a real straight-edge razor shave. Very professional.

5	This barber school is one of the best out here, great students that learn from great instructors!
