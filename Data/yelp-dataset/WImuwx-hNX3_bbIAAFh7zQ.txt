4	I had a wisdom tooth issue and had to see my dentist, only to be told that my issue was something that had to be taken care of by an oral surgeon. Well I was in pain and it was 4:00 in the afternoon. Figured I was out of luck to get my problem taken care that day. My dentist called 3 other places about getting me in that day and when they called Dr. Goldenstein's office they agreed to see me! I was suprised, but very relieved...the tooth  needed to go! When I arrived, I felt very welcomed. Being in the medical field myself, I know how much you look forward to 5:00/quitting time. I knew they were going to be there past that time, but they never made me feel like I was an inconvienance. Did the xray, watched the video, payed for the procedure then the show was on the road. Dr. Goldenstein was very friendly as well as his assistant. I felt very comfortable and I am one who HATES getting any dental work done. I go only when the pain strikes! I felt like I was in good hands, and the procedure went well. The next day I did not have hardlyh any pain...and when it comes to getting a wisdom tooth extraction, thats saying alot!
4	Been to Dr. Goldenstein a few times. He is a genuinely nice man who will make a situation right if need be. I cant say the same for his rude receptionist. I would recommend people to come see him for sure. Hes taken me in last minute a few times when I was in extreme pain. He doesn't like to see people in pain.
1	The office was always running behind on appointments, once I sat waiting for over and hour in the waiting room. What's worse is that the tricked me into having a procedure. I came only to have one tooth pulled, and after "consultation" they recommended I get 5. Then once I raised concerns about my insurance not covering it, they assured me they talked to my insurance provider and I was fully covered. 5 weeks later I have a $500 bill from my provider. Total sleaze balls!
