4	This place has very good sushi at reasonable prices. Service is good and staff if friendly. Nicely designed.
3	Great place, very nice decor. Sushi is typical of a upscale sushi place. Not the best I have tried. I never seen this restaurant full, however even if the restaurant is empty service is really slow. It's not my first choice for sushi, but if I am not downtown montreal i'd go here.
3	PROS:1. Decor is nice. Love the hanging lanterns. 2. The seafood soup was light and deeelicious. The sashimi, sushi, and maki were well made and presented.CONS:1. A bit pricey for what it's worth.OVERALL:-Not a terrible or outstanding place for sushi. So-so. I would go here if I'm in Laval and craving sushi otherwise I wouldn't make an effort to go to Torii.
4	The Maki rolls were great. Real crunch where it needed to be. Staff is friendly and knows the food well. Readily accomodates food allergy requests. Atmosphere is casual and friendly.
1	This is my 2nd stop in the place, the 1st time was take out.  The food was over-priced, and the quality of food is very poor.  My roommates make better sushi than them.I also tipped poorly based on the service, and the manager came after me after I walked away and told me the way i tip was not accepted.  He went on and on about I need to tip 10% no matter what happens, then i told him I wrote down my order I got my own check then why would i tip someone 15% for doing nothing.  The food was not good as well, so I especially don't appreciate his condescending tone with me, after I already walked away.  What a bully!  No wonder my table was the only customers the whole night, I thought the service was terrible.  I watched the waiter/sushi makers chit chat the whole night, when I waited for food and my check.
