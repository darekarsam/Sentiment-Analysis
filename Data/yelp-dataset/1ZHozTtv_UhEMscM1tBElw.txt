4	Pepper beef and cantonese noodles delish! What a deal! The shanghai noodle soup leaves a lot to be desired though. Bland broth filled with udon style noodles and porc and shrimp. Palatable with lots of siracha!
4	Not bad for a place we found by fluck. Most of the food was authenIc and extremly cheap. I pretty much liked everything.  I esp. Liked the curry chicken.
