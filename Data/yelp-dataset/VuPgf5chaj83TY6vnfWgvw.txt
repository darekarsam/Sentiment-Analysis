4	Great Staff, Very Friendly and Dr. Pham is awesome. I didn't feel like he was looking for money he really cared about what was going on with my teeth. I love that the staff and Dr. Pham break down the cost of everything so you know how much you are paying or how much insurance is covering.
5	the dentist is awesome, they never let me wait, with or without appointment. everything will be explained to you before they do any procedure. They wont push u to do this or that unlike some other dental clinic ive been to. And u can do payment arrangement with them. I will stick to this dental place.
5	I had a great time at the dentist! I know it sounds weird, but Dr. Pham was awesome! First time going to the dentist in years, never floss, brush once a day, but I never got the lecture I was expecting.He explained everything that needed to be done, and how much insurance was going to cover, and how much my co-pay was going to be. He deep cleaned, drilled the mercury out of my head, and top it off with a good ol' wisdom tooth pull in less than 2 hours. Karen, the office manager is amazing too, she's very positive and happy, and makes you feel a lot better about being at the dentist. One last thing is they get you in the chair quick! No waiting around for long. I highly recommend Eastern Hills Dental!
