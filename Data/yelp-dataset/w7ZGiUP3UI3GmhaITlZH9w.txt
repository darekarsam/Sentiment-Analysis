5	Its hard to find a good Chiropractor in the valley. Dr. Dorchester and his staff at At My Best Health are absolutely the best in the business. I have both upper and lower back issues so seeing Dr. Dorchester on regular bases keeps me in tack and muscle tense free. Always there when you need an emergency quick fix... (which has happened a time or two) I would not hesitate in recommending Dr. Dorchester and his team at At My Best Health. Thumbs Up! 100%-Michelle Conlon
1	Be warned - this practice operates like an unscrupulous used car dealership and try to upsell their services without providing full disclosure of cost. I bought a living social massage and was talked into the performance benefits of regular adjustments for athletes during my visit. I declined their offer for other tests and a full physical exam  during my 2nd visit as I already have a family doctor and only agreed to the routine chiropractic adjustment which I paid in full during the time of my visit.  So as you can imagine, I was very surprised to learn that they billed my insurance for physical therapy at 8 times the full price disclosed for chiropractic care and was informed that my obligation was around 4 times the cash price paid. I would rate the quality of service as average and their professional ethic and customer service as very low - they will attempt to make the most out of you and your insurance at every opportunity. Make sure you get everything in writing.
5	When I recovered from femoral hernia , I had a numb, tingly feeling and hurt to touch feelings in my thighs , was told to go to physical therapist and I was recommended to At My Best Health by a friend, and been going there and they helped me with my thighs, and it's better to this day. I would recommend Dr. Dorchester to anyone.
5	Just tried this place out not that long ago from a mailer. I will keep going. They really helped my neck out. Prices are good, the owner worked multiple services discounts out with me. Good service
