4	come here to use the car wash most of the time. it works but kinda expensive
3	Why do I stop here? Convenience? It's at the last ramp off I-515 so that has something to do with it. It's not due to gas prices which are almost always the highest within 10 miles per the gas price apps. It's not for the c-store which changed their product mix and seems to find ways to go with cheaper quality stuff. I know it's not due to their bathrooms! Ick! And the $0.25 cent fee for using your debit card still irritates me and I give them flak for it every time I go in the door for charging it. But then again when I go in and I get a smile more often than not, and I don't have to wait in line for a gas pump, that counts for something. If you're on your way to Boulder City or further out, or if you have a trailer / toy hauler / 5th wheel while tight it's still a lot easier to get in and out of than dealing with the zoo at the Rebel station in Boulder City. 3 stars: Service with a smile, lots of gas pumps and a multi-bay car wash, and easy Interstate access.
2	It's conveniently located off of 95/93, but that's about it. It tends to be the most expensive gas around. If you can make it to Boulder City or Horizon, you'll save a few cents per gallon. Also, avoid the coffee. Don't know how they can get coffee wrong, but they do.
4	Good place to get gas, plenty of pumps with 2 or 3 diesel gas pumps available. They have 1 air pump/water station that cost $0.75. They have a hot food area inside the store if you want to grab a quick bite to eat and hit the road and also if you would like to wash your car or RV they have 3-4 car wash bays with I believe 2-3 vacuum stations.
