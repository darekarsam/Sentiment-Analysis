5	I ordered a custom leather sofa and love seat from Z Home and it is spectacular! I wanted to find furniture that was made in the USA and they have it! David and I talked thru frames, seat height, leathers and he helped me design a beautiful set. It was made here in North Carolina and is incredibly well built. This is my 4th time buying leather furniture and certainly the highest quality by a long shot. The time line between purchase and delivery was a little longer than expected (about 5 weeks) but it was worth the wait! My biggest worry was that I had to pay upfront which made me nervous, but it truly was a great decision and one I would make again. This is an upstanding place with great service and leather furniture.
