5	Customer was great from design layout and color matching all the way down to the installer cleaning up. I highly recommend Tony and Brazastone --the price was much more affordable than others Mateo Thalheimer
5	This is a great place to get your granites!  Customer service is on point...not to mention a great selection onsite.  Being as it was our first time upgrading our home, we wanted to make sure the quality was right to increase the value.  It has been almost a year now since we've installed our new countertops and it is still as good as new.I highly recommend this place!
1	I had different experience with this company. They gave me a quote based on kitchen plan I provided. I asked to come and measure it to make sure. They requested to deposit half before coming in. I insisted and they did me a "favor" and took whole week to do it. They came up with twice hire price an recommend to find other company to do my countertop. Very "personalized" customer service.
5	Well I waited a long time to get my granite counter tops and Brazastone gave me everything I could have hoped for.  Extremely friendly, helpful, and an absolutely beautiful selection to choose from.  The guys that came to install it were so proffesional and did such an impeccable job.  I've Been looking at countertops for years and there is a difference between those that know what they're doing and those that think they know what they're doing. Brazastone knows their stuff! Definitely five stars! Thanks you guys!
