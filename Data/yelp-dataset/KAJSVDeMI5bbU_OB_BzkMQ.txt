4	I've been to quite a few of these in California so I figured I'd check this locale out as well while staying at the Green Valley Ranch. (NOTE: I put this under the wrong address but i'm sure this location is great too! lol  I'm talking about the one in the shops at Green Valley Ranch!)You know when you try and pack to go to Vegas....you either over-pack or under-pack or try and get everything all monochromatic so that you can mix and match for a variety of sexy ensembles?  Well, The White House Black Market is PERFECT for those nights out on the town...I mean, all they carry is BLACK and WHITE articles of clothing and shoes and we all know that black and white friggin' go with EVERYTHING! lol  It's a win win situation people.I popped in here and ended up leaving with a $150 strapless, little black dress.  Of course, not to actually be worn in Vegas lol, but it WILL work nicely for the few weddings I have upcoming in the next coupla months.And don't fret...not everything is that pricey.  In fact, I just happened to grab something NOT on sale!  There was a few racks in there with 40% off so take a peek around...
1	Horrible store...it used to be great but since the old manger Danielle left it has completely fallen apart. The sales girls are mean and rude. My mother and I spend a great deal of money at White House Black Market and neither of us can believe the horrible customer service at this store. So lucky that this isn't the only store in Las Vegas because trust me, I will never EVER shop at this one at the Fashion Show Mall EVER again. The shops at Summerlin one and the Palazzo as well as Town Square one are all wonderful but I would avoid this one at all costs!!
