4	Nice and friendly service, a bit on the slow side but such is central America!  Had the spicy ribs, tender and juicy but not spicy.  Presentation nice, mango daiquiri missing salted ring, house red wine adequate with ribsWill I go back? definitely.  Though the Village does not feel safe even during day time as my dog was bitten on the head by a pitbull and afterward insulted by the owner of that dog.  Bottom line police not there
4	Hola,Food is great but service is a bit slow, nothing we do not know about!  Again got some great food and take out, what is not to like?Nada and welcome to the Village!
4	Good food and great service!  My friend and I both enjoyed our meals.  The atmosphere is nice, especially if you sit out on the patio during the summer.  It's a great place to people watch while sipping margaritas. The waitress and owner were both friendly and I would definitely go back.
1	Worst. Burrito. Ever. I had lunch there today and ordered the Grilled Chicken Burrito. It was, by far, the worst burrito I have ever had. Somehow, it was very watery. I don't even know how that is possible.
