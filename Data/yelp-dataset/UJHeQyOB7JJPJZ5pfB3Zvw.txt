1	This place makes Panda Express seem like high quality fine dining. Probably the most bland, tasteless chowmein I have ever had. Even soy sauce couldn't help it. Server had to dig around to find chicken in the kung pao dish. To top it off, it was about $10 more than Panda Express would have been for the same dishes. Very disappointed, won't be back, avoid at all costs.
1	Sad!  Though fried rice was fresh, chow mein, Ginger Chicken, & Crispy "Cashew" Chicken were OLD and Dry!  Then, when asking about a cup of ice water, I'm told they only have soda water.  Huh?  I'm not shelling out $3.45 for a regular (read: SMALL) soda/soft drink - probably without a refill anyway!  Poor customer service, old/dated food, and attitude from the cashier!  NOT coming back here.  (Can I give 1/4 Star???)  AND, when almost done with "Cashew" Shrimp - that only had peanuts! - there was a half of a cooked toothpick!!!  (I HOPE it wasn't a used Sample Toothpick!)  :-(  1/4 Star is now downgraded to officially ZERO STARS!
1	Overpriced crap Asian food. Noodles had wayyyy too much garlic and the entrees weren't that great either. Better off eating McDonald's nearby.
1	Everything is overpriced in the Flamingo food court, but this has to be the single worst Vegas fast food experience for me. $8.95 for a ***TINY*** child size bowl consisting of a mixture of rice/chow mein and one entree. $3.95 for a large soda, $3.45 for a medium soda. Attitudes from the employees. The Vegas buffets are expensive, but even they are a better deal than this dump, at least you will get a lot more food for the price. I will never be back.
