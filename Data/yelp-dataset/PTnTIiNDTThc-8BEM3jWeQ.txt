5	So I work at a small animal hospital in the valley, so my expectations of client and patient care is really high.  Chapparral is also an equine hospital which is why I chose them to treat my horse.  The diagnosis of my horse was grim and I had to make the decision to put him down, it was an incredibly difficult time, but the staff was comforting and supportive from beginning to end.  Their compassion and thoughtfulness to the care of my beautiful boy was felt from the first person to touch him, all the way to the last.  They were gentle and kind to him, and when I knew I was going to put him down, they asked if I wanted to have some of his mane and tail to take home with me.  With tear filled eyes I said yes; they brushed his mane and tail out and braided two beautiful pieces from his mane, and braided and cut his tail for me to take home.  After cutting the mane and tail, they tied beautiful ribbon around each piece as a keep sake for me to take home.  There was so much thought in providing me something to comfort me and help remember him by.  During a very difficult time the staff was amazing and I am so grateful for the care we received while we were there.  From someone who knows the veterinary industry I want to let others know how great this hospital is, and let everyone know I strongly recommend them for care of your beloved pets.  I still have one beautiful horse left, and you can count on me using them in the future for his care as well.
