1	Agreed.  Customer service at this location is such a joke.  I don't understand how this place is still in business.  All the reviews of BBQ galore are horrible and everything is overpriced.  I am a avid grillmaster and I always want to give this place the benefit of the doubt, but everytime I come in, I walk away disappointed.Chris, if you are the manager of this location...you might want to hire a more friendly staff.This place is a joke!
1	God these guys are so rude. It's like, it's not enough you're overpriced- but basic phone and customer service manners are non-existent. Called them with a simple request after regretfully spending 1200 on a BBQ from these dbags and the hillbilly who answered the phone was next level rude- do yourself a favor, go somewhere else.
5	I used them for my built in BBQ grille and could not be happier. Ramiz my salesman is very special and really gets the job done. Now for the best part, we also bought two sets of fireplace gas logs. I wanted the remote operated ones and he advised me against it. But I ordered anyway ! What do you know 4 months later they quit working. At my choice the gladly exchanged for the non remote logs. Ramiz is the best.
5	my wife and i came in today, Ron helped us. Very pleased the store, the grills he showed us. He was very helpful, great customer service. We will be back when we are ready to put our yard in. Thanks for the great service!
