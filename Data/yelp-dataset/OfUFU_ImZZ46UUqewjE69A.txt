5	The best cat veterinarian in Las Vegas has a new office.  It may be a longer drive for some, but the new facility is gorgeous.  It has a large, clean waiting area, and the cats of the Poppy Foundation have a home all their own, with lots of room to sleep, play, and live out their days.  This new facility will allow Dr Steelman to provide even better care to the cats of the Las Vegas community.
5	We brought my kitten here to have a surgery done on his eye and we could not have been happier with the care and service Bonanza Cat Hospital provided. Dr. Linda Steelman took the time with us to talk about our cat and she is highly qualified, very knowledgable and passionate about what she does! Despite all of this wonderful care, it all comes at a reasonable price!
5	Dr. Steelman is in my opinion the very best veterinarian in Las Vegas. I'm fortunate to live as close as I do to her new cat hospital.
1	Avoid at all cost, something is fishy with this place.  Took an ill cat here and dropped her off.  Later at night they called and said there was nothing wrong with her but her kidneys were starting to fail which is normal with older cats.  Next morning they call to say she had a seizure and passed away. So we had her cremated, weeks passed by and these clowns don't even have the decency to phone the owner to let them know the ashes of the deceased pet can be picked up.There's way better choices to bring your pets out there, places that actually show some compassion.  This place is downright horrible.  You say you love cats, well that may be true for your own but as far as mine you made my family feel like you can care less.I
