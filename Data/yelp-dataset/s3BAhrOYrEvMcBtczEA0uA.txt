1	My first time eating at a Five Guys, and I do not understand where all the rave is about. I was really disappointed with my burger. The service could not be worst! It took them 5 minutes to realized that my food had not been given to me. I was given the wrong order. I am very picky about my burger. The staff is unfortunately clueless, and not highly motivated. They rather make jokes between them, the assist customers.
4	I won't go into a full blown review for what Five Guys is. If your expectations is a huge tasty burger that can be made exactly the way you want it and grilled to perfection along with the yummiest fries to hit the spot with free soda refills all under 15$, then you found the place.Kindly note, there's no drive through and the wait to get your food can sometimes take 5-10 minutes as they create the huge burger of your choice. The staff tends to look bored and serve you somewhat slowly. It's hit and miss in this regard.A must try for the burger and fries!
