3	Beau p'tit bar de quartier ! Une belle ambiance et du beau monde ! Pas mal de choix au niveau de l'alcool + services de bouteilles.
4	Interesting place. It's quite nice. They have a fun little food menu. I went in on a Thursday and it was a full house. I certainly wouldn't call it a Plateauish bar. It actually felt like I was in a tv commercial for something like Madison Steak House or the Keg. You know that scene where everyone is dressed up in a suit and over exaggerating how much fun they are having.I gave it 4 stars despite the fact that I found it a little too west island for my taste. But I do like a bar to be full, and not of smelly artist types who only wash their 1993 sweater once a year. At last count there were about 237 bars like that in the Plateau.
