5	Visited recently. Nebula has a comfortable atmosphere and very friendly assistance. The tasting table is great. Loved the flavors - even though the selection was limited. Being able to try the flavors is a great plus. Limited selection of hardware - but what they do have is very good.
5	Great shop. Went in on a impulse yesterday to get new parts for my ecig and while their replacement parts did not fit the employees were so nice and considerate. Also they sell some good juice well worth the price. I will be back monthly
5	Amazing service. And they have my pink Manhattan waiting for me. They are always willing to answer any question I may have. And they actually remember there customers, which shows their dedication to customer service. Try the butter beer with caffeine. It's my new wake me up vape! I can't say enough good things about these guys that would do them justice. *cough* white chocolate chai *cough*
5	Their selection of ejuice is amazing! I'm addicted to Halley's Comet...it's a menthol wintergreen flavor! The employees are so nice as well! I'll definitely be going back.
5	This shop is great! The owners run the shop and are always so helpful and nice. They are true professionals and have artisan liquids. I'm starting to think there is nothing they can't come up with. The new place is hip and fun. They have a great tasting table where you can try everything they have to offer. Awesome job Nebula!
