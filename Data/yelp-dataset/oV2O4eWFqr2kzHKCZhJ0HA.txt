1	I went to this Dr. De Andrade for some sensitivity on one of my tooth. His office staff is very very rude. Once I was there he tried to sell me $2000 worth of surgery I did not need after I got a second opinion.
1	The only interest DeAndrade has is in your insurance coverage..A lousy, rude office staff who equally doesn't give a crap about you..DeAndrade keeps you waiting in the chair for 40 minutes because he is so busy selling his procedures to potential clients sitting in his other rooms. If you have rotten gums, that doesn't mean you go to a rotten dentist..If you use DeAndrade you indeed have found a rotten dentist. Avoid at all costs.
1	I had work done by him. He is crude and disgusting at best. After he had my cash in his pocket, his whole attitude changed. He could have cared less. Typical Vegas type. Do yourself a huge favor ......avoid him at all costs.
5	I recently completed extensive periodontal work with Dr. DeAndrade and he was nothing but kind, patient and gentle with me throughout my treatment. He took the time to explain each procedure thoroughly and told me exactly what to expect. He is an amazing doctor!
5	Personally, I am one of those people that hate having dental work done. And then when you are told that you need extensive gum grafting done that is another story entirely!  I have to say Dr. Deandrade and his office made me feel at home the whole time. From the customer service, to the care and concern and follow up, to the absolute great outcome I received, this office is spectacular. I would highly recommend his practice to anyone in town.
