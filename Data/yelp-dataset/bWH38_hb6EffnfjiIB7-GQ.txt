4	This place is potentially a 5-star for me but I will have to go back a few more times to know for sure. The workers are so friendly and welcoming, it felt like I was back in K-town in NYC for a minute :). I asked our waitress a few questions about the menu, and then I saw that they have jjambbong (my absolute favorite). She explained to me that it's different here (not our traditional jjambbong, but similar.. and with udon noodles!). Of course I was intrigued. I ordered it my usual style (as spicy as possible with extra noodles). When it came out, it looked and smelled incredible but I knew right away that it will not be anything like jjambbong. There were lot of crabs in it, which you never really find in a traditional bowl of jjambbong but I was more than happy to see them! They were fantastic! There wasn't enough noodles for sure... because I asked for extra noodles, and it did not come even close to cutting the cake. I can't imagine what the bowl is like without the extra noodles..... probably just soup? Anyhow, this dish is a great choice if you like spicy seafood. I will definitely be ordering it again!I want to return to this place to try other food items but I know it will be hard not to order the same dish I tried :).
