5	Jean-Paul Riopelle square is one of my favourite places in Montreal. It is in fact little park with numerous benches surrounded by new buildings and brightened by the colourful windows of Palais des Congres. Whether you come from Old Montreal or China Town you would be surprised by the feeling of freshness and contrasting modernity. What is really outstanding about this square is the fountain of the famous Montreal born artist Jean-Paul Riopelle: La Joute. You can read about its history yourself in Wikipedia: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Joute, just don't forget to see it with your own eyes. It is beautiful!
