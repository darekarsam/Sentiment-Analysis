5	After looking for a new hairdressers for ages after moving over from Glasgow, I looked on yelp and thanks to the previous review, I decided to book an appointment for a very long awaited haircut, at what seemed to be more a gents hairdressers than a ladies.Not only was I made to feel extremely welcome, it has to be the best cut and blow I have had in years. I felt a million dollars leaving the shop, 6 inches lighter and also very pleasantly surprised by the price.Boombarbers is now my new hairdressers in Edinburgh. Big thumbs up and a huge thank you!
