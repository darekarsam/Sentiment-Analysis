1	Way over priced....... The service was terrible..need I go on?
1	Waste of time and money. My wheels are still dirty. Inside was barely wiped down and can tell no cleaner was used just a dry towel that left lint EVERYWHERE. I should've known a good job couldn't have been done in the 6 minutes I was there.
1	Just horrible!!!I drive a Nissan 350Z so I take pride in my ride. It was covered in pollen so I wanted to get it cleaned. I should of just done it myself. For them to claim that they vacuumed there was stuff all inside my car still and for them to say they wipe down the inside they must use dirty clothes because they missed a whole side of my car and you could see all the dirt and dust left inside of it. For it to be a so called manager special I was kind of pissed I spent pretty good money just to have a car that was still dirty. Wheels still had dirt on them the car still had pollen on it. So it was a pointless wash!Did I mention that it's a manager special?! Damn shame, I'm sure their manager doesn't want their car like that. Oh and who puts armor all on the damn clutch and break petals? I tried shifting into first gear and my foot slid off I mean c'mon. Danger much???
1	Horrible horrible horrible. I specifically told them that the most important thing for me was the interior as I have 2 kids which create crumbs and dirt everywhere. I even paid extra for the Armorall. After I arrived home and opened the back doors to reinstall the car seats, I realized they hadn't even attempted to wipe down anything in the backseat! Nothing. Not the seat, not the doors, not the back of the seats. They didn't even look back there because if they had they would have seen dirt marks and food leftovers on the seats. I took a Clorox wipe and wiped down everything but I will never go to this location again and to be honest I will probably stay away from auto bells from now on. This really put a bad taste in my mouth as to the truly shoddy work these lazy employees do.
