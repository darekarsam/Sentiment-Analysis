5	Wow!  Carolyn saved the day!  After visiting Flora Bella and getting flowers arranged for my wedding at the last minute, they gave me Carolyn's card and told me to give her a call for my last minute linen needs.  I'm so glad I did!  I called Carolyn and she chatted it up with me, letting me know I have plenty of time and why don't I come down and look at colors?  So I went to the store/office (hard to find!). She showed me a couple of shades of purple and she showed me a couple of ways to tie the chair ties.  Carolyn was very upfront and helpful, and about 15 minutes later I had rented 80 dark purple chair ties at such an affordable price!I came and picked them all up (it's extra if you want delivery/set up) and a week later I dropped them back off.  It was that easy!!Carolyn is personable and great to work with too!
5	She's the best!!
5	I've had the pleasure of experiencing Special Event Linens through the cleaning of my linens and have nothing but great things to say. Yes they do offer linen cleaning services in addition to renting their own linens! The price is competitive to other cleaners and it's nice to support a local business along the way. They get my linens done in a timely manner and I always enjoy working with the staff. I will come to them if I ever need to rent linens as well!
