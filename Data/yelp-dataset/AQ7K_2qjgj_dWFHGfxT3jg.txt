5	This place is hands down the best 3d nail art place in Las Vegas. Go to this place for top notch nail service.
5	Both nail techs take their time & do great work! I love coming here & they always have great ideas!
1	There is no denying that they do great work...but good luck trying to get an appointment! There is no sense of urgency. I wanted my nails done specifically by them because they do such good work, I tried contacting them by phone and Internet to set up an appointment, never heard anything back from them. Seems to me like they don't really care about getting more clientele.
