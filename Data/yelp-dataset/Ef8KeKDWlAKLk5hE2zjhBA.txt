5	John was a huge help finding the perfect home in Charlotte.   He showed us a number of neighborhoods until we narrowed on exactly the perfect fit for us.  John even counseled us about moving too fast and saved us from a bad decision -- we ended up in a much better home because of John's counsel.John involved us only when necessary and handled so many of the behind the scene details.  We could not have been more pleased with John.
