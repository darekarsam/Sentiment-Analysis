4	FINALLY! So glad this is now open. No complaints here so far. Take into consideration that it's brand new and it's still being worked on. Staff is ALWAYS extremely helpful and nice. Food is amazing. This location saves me about a 45 minute round trip to the other location. Thank you.
3	I love this location, the problem is that it gets soooo busy here it has an effect on the quality of food being made. The line to the drive-through gets 20-30 cars deep at peak lunch and dinner hours. I've been here about five times total and twice my food has been a bit undercooked.I know it recently opened, but by now the kinks should have been worked out. If I had to choose, I'd go to the Chik-fil-a at 31st Ave and Beardsley instead of this.
1	Food is uninspired, dry, tasteless and bland.  Not worth the effort, not just because of the food, but because it is always busy for some reason.
5	The Grilled Market Salad was amazing and the service was too! Nice to see happy people who love their job's! I'll definitely be back!
2	Nice clean location, friendly staff. Two stars because they have, and I have let them, forget my ice cream cone twice.
5	This seems to be a busy location, but the service was above average and my order was timely, hot and correct. They have a roving attendant in the dining room to keep everything clean, stocked and provide any additional condiments and/or refills that you might require.
