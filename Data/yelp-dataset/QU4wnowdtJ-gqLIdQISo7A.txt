4	It's a pretty typical Starbucks. We went because we got a little lost and our phones weren't working without the internet, so we knew we could get a decent beverage here. The staff was friendly enough, and heard us speaking in English so they automatically spoke english to us (though the one girl working did speak english nearly exclusively even when she was chatting with co-workers). They spelled our names completely wrong. It's always amusing when someone at starbucks does that. This time mine became "Aaren". Prices seemed  a bit higher than what I'm used to, I'm not sure if it's because I'm buying in the US mostly or because I'm not in a major city.
4	I realize that I'm reviewing a dominant chain that most people have already experienced, but there were a few things that really stood out at this particular Starbucks. Location - Strategically placed just outside of the train station. The only other option I could see was Timmy's and I don't do double doubles.Staff - I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly and patient they were as I practiced my French. French is my 3rd language and I speak it much better than I can write. Hence the reason why all my MTL reviews will be in English.Coffee - I had the best Caramel Macchiato here. I always get an extra shot of espresso and this time I could really taste it. It was strong, slightly sweet, with a good amount of foam, and I loved every single sip.WC - The washroom was in mint condition. After being on a VIA train for hours, I really enjoyed freshening up without having to wobble around from side to side.Patio - Best feature of all, this location has a nice patio facing the intersection of Rue De La Gauchetiere and University. Upon our arrival, the gods blessed us with gorgeous weather so that my girl and I could enjoy our coffees as we watched the world go by.
