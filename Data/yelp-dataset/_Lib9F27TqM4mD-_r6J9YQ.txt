5	Best pizza in Charlotte (my opinion).  The thin crust is really good- it's like a giant cracker.  The sauce is not too thick and relatively sweet.  Very generous with the pepperonis- they cover the whole pizza.  Wait time is also super short.  Call ahead pick-up usually gets a pie in 10-15 minutes.  If you live in an apartment, delivery might take a while, but I guess that depends on how intuitive the building numbers are (mine sucks).   There's that, but pick-up is usually flawless.
2	Good pizza, but not near worth the price.  3 medium signature pizza's delivered was over $50.  They cut it different.  THin crust was the best.
4	This was the best Pizza I've had in a long time!  I love how they cut it!It makes it easier to eat and it makes it feel like your pizza goes along way, because you have like 30 little pieces instead of 8- pieces.Would recommend anyone who has never tried Donatos to do so, and also their breadstix are amazing!
