2	The food is worth two stars; I've had much better but it could be worse.  I have not found better Japanese food around Waterloo, but this was not worth going back to.  The strip-mall location is bad and inside the restaurant is poorly decorated.  Service was acceptable.
2	the food is just ok.. and the price is pretty high!! so not as reasonable.. I rather go further to Cambridge or Waterloo to hv some nicer japanese food!
5	I have not found a better sushi restaurant outside Japan.  The nigiri at Taka is perfect in every way.  Eating at Taka is an exciting experience that I look forward to days in advance.  For non-sushi lovers, their Korean menu choices are great as well, try the Bi Bim Bap.  The chef is pleasant and courteous.  He smiles and greets every customer and finishes his sentences with laughter.  Taka Japanese Restaurant has Japanese-style booths (with curtains!) to enjoy your meal in as well as a few open tables.
