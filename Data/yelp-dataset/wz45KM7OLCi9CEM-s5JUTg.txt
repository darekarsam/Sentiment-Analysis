1	We bought cabinets from discount cabinets , poor service ,poor return phone calls ,damaged cabinets when arrived ,you get the total runaround ,this place is a big joke ,also you have to get what they build for sizes ,,if you want to get jacked around and lied to this is the place ,,you can buy from home depot or lowes  and get much better prices and better quality and much better service , discount cabinets is a  fly by night operation ,and ran very poor ,read other reviews and you will see what I am telling you , STAY CLEAR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5	Great prices and easy to deal with. Got new cabinets and granite for the price others quoted to resurface the cabinets !
1	Very disappointed!!! Ordered 4 bathroom cabinets and told would take a week to get. Just got them over a month later. The scheduled delivery three times and did not show each time. Wasted my time each time. They would not return my phone calls and when I got through it always I call you right back in 15 but no one would. It was really like pulling teeth. The cabinets  are good but I would take my business else where. They are to hard to deal with and will destroy any schedule you have to complete your project.
