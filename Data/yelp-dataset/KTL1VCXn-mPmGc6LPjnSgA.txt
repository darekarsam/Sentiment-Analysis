5	Why does a fast food chain place get five stars in my book? B/c they offer Shamrock shakes. Big deal right? No. I went to three McDonald's the other night looking for one and none of them had them or machine was "broken" (i.e. they already cleaned it and didn't want to make it) I may be a little obsessed but Shamrock shakes are top notch in my book. When going through the drive thru at the Wendover location, I told the employee at the window how happy I was about the Shamrock shake and he told me that he was happy for me and I quote "Your hair looks good, boo" Just what I needed to hear after getting my hair done. Love.
2	No Shamrock shake for me, just a McDouble and a Diet Coke to quiet the rumbles. Even though I was clear with my order to be eating in, it still arrived in a to go bag. (He also forgot the drink, but was reminded by a supervisor.) I took a table where I had a view of the counter and watched the same guy miss two other drinks.My burger was a little on the messy side with ketchup and chopped onions outside the bun.Free wifi is a plus and the parking is good. But I would have to say that I've had better experiences at McDonalds. Give this one a miss.
4	This place was recently upgraded and it looks great!!  New staff as well.  4 stars.
2	I don't know if its the time I'm going but the attitudes are unbelievable. I cannot express how rude Tasha was to me. Which is fine because frankly i didn't need it anyways. Needless to say i will not go back .
1	Everytime i come here there is problem with the food and the attitudes with every worker here. I mean seriously its the closest to my house but not even worth the trouble. I mean really.
