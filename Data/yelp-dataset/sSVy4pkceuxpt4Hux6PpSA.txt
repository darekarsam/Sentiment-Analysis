5	Good program. Everything is included, even a job!
5	this driving school is the best i learn a lot. the teachers are great and they really look out for you to do your bast. I have to say, prior to my road test I was really nervous. Although, I knew how to drive, i went in to learn some more basics, and tricks of the trade. My instructor really helped me relax, and instructed me styep by step on how to pass my test. If you want quality instruction head to them. It was really hard for me to decide on a place, and once I walked in, I felt a little relieved, and once I passed, I knew it was because of them.
5	Not only are the prices greater then other places but they are very patient and understanding of your skill level and needs. I took about 4 lessons because im a quick learner but each lesson the instructors taught me something new and provided an easy method that helped me learn  from parking, U turning, Left hand turns.They made me feel confident by the time my road test came.They are great and genuinely care.
