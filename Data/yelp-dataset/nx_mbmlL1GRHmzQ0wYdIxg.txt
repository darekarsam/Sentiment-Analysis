3	CVS is known as a great Pharmaceutical chain that also offers everyday grocery items.  This store located off the 215 and Valley Verede is a great addition to this wonderful chain.The savings and weekly specials are very hard to beat at CVS.  I have always enjoyed the service and 24 hour drive through Pharmacy at almost every location.  Awesome store!!!

4	We've used CVS Pharmacy a few times for our pharmaceutical needs.  Fortunately it hadn't been busy so there wasn't a long wait.  The pharmacy tech is always very nice and fast to process the prescription. We usually wait there for them to fill. Luckily it has always been 10 minutes or less.When you are ailing, the last thing you want to do is wait around.  They do a great job of being quick and convenient!
