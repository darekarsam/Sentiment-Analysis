2	This Sonic Drive-In is ok.  I think it is more the idea of what drive-ins used to be why one goes to a Sonic. I have only heard and seen what a drive-in used to be like on documentaries and some movies. The food here is what it is for what you pay for it. You do not go here expecting anything great  tasting as you just will not get it. After all this is fast food. The carhops do not use skates. Saving this location from a lower score is the friendly service received.
3	Car hop was nice (in that fake nice sort of way). It did take them a while to answer the button and they weren't even busy. We went after I had to visit the urgent care across the street. At least 2 songs played before we got to order. The one on 48th st and baseline is way better
2	Slow service. I've come multiple times to the drive through and end up waiting more than five minutes for service.
