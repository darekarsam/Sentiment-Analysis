4	I don't buy too much Lucky these days, but after the boy and I found a Lucky shirt in Belk we liked that was sold out in the size needed, we decided to see if the store carried it.About two thirds of the store is women's, and we made it just to the edge of the men's section when we were greeted by fantastic sales associate #1. We continued to browse without too much conversation as there were other people in the store, but upon needing a fitting room we had the attention of all the employees. The ladies chatted me up as we waited for the modeling to commence.He tried on four or five, the ladies always siding with me (I too used to play those retail games) they even tried to help me get him into a few that were out of his comfort zone, but were never pushy, which I appreciate. It really hasn't changed my opinion of the brand for me, but I definitely won't hesitate to stop in to look for something for him in the future.
5	I took a random drive from columbia to Charlotte just for this mall that the lucky store is in as we have just one mall here and it's not that great, I was so happy to find a lucky store and bought several awesome items I had seen no where else, I especially loved this pair of Malibu shorts with embroidered trim above the cut off part, ya they are $ but they are original, I haven't seen any like that so I got them.  I accidentally grabbed the wrong size!!  I got all the way home and a few days later I was happy to wear them when I put them on they come right off!!  I couldn't possibly lost all that weight in 3 days so I know I grabbed the 28s when I should have grabbed the 27s!!  So I called today - the store is awesome!!  The friendly woman grabbed a pair of 27s and put them on hold in the back for me, I'm going to try to make it back there next weekend, if not I ship mine back and they ship me the new ones in the right size!!  So happy that they will do this!  I was afraid I had wasted $80 but it looks like all will be resolved!Thanks so much!!
