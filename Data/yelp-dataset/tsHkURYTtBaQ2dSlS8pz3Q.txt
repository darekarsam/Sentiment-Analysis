5	Great hat shop!!! Amazing quality!! It's nice to visit and meet a store owner who is passionate about what they do. Hats are a great price for the quality they do. Even though I couldn't afford one myself they treated me like I could. I'll be definitely saving for this investment
5	It's just a hat. If that's what the voice in your head is saying, you haven't spoken with Eric Watson. He and his mother, Dawn, are the proprietor/ educators @ this custom hattery. Being passionate about your work is the lifeblood of any small business, and it permeates every corner of this small family shop. From teaching the basics of hat etiquette (I always thought the dent was there to facilitate my finger position on that classic panama) to sharing their wealth of knowledge on materials, methods and styles, this mother/son duo is committed to enriching your lid experience. Do yourself a favor - if you're considering a new cover - regardless of style, you owe it to yourself (and all those who'll be seeing you in it) to pay a visit to Watson's.
1	Greedy, Greedy, GreedyStopped in to have a slight crease steamed out of my Borsolino and also to look for another Panama.  After spending a few minutes steaming my hat, Watson showed me his stock.  I told him I'd think about it, and asked how much I owed for the steaming.I was absolutely shocked:  $25.00!!!!  The only thing this marketing and customer loyalty genius accomplished was to guaranty that I will never buy from him and will tell anyone who will listen to avoid this shop.
