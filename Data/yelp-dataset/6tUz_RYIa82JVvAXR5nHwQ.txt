4	I had the braised pork cheek with potatoes, tomatoes, littleneck clams and bell sausage. This dish was really rich and thick and is probably still processing its way through my system two days later. I can totally picture myself eating this on a hillside cabin on the French Alps after shredding through perfect powder, that is... if I skied or travel to France often... so I won't. Instead, in a back alley terrasse next to a St. Hubert Rotisserie blasting Racine in Cote des Neiges surrounded by French people will just have to do.
