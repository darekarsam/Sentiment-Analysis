5	One word: amazing.
1	I came today on a Sunday because yelp says they are open until 8 and turns out they were closed. I would have been a first timer. So sad. Fix the hours.
2	Not bad, but have had much better anywehere else... can skip it for the cupcakes. Staff was very friendly and nice, the facility was comfy and drinks were good; go because of that and you'll enjoy youself.
