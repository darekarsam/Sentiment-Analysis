5	I have been getting my nails done here for the past year, I LOVE IT! I always have a great experience here, D does an amazing job on my nails. They do some awesome shaping, (I always get cat nails) and they are open to making some pretty crazy designs. Always have great specials, they offer you a choice of a beverage and I always treat myself to getting my nails done. Right on University City Blvd, in the plaza where CiCi's is. They are new and I love the environment.Tops Down Best Place to get your nails done in the University UNCC Area.!!!
5	Ive been coming here for a while now and I love it. To find them, they're located at Wex Ford Plaza right next to Cici's Pizza. I highly recommend checking them out; its worth it. And I absolutely love the many options of wines and sodas that they have.
3	Small place in a half closed strip mall; I wouldn't want to be here at night. My nails turned out the way I wanted, I'm not complaining. I got pale pink with gold glitter on top - looks like champagne. The place is a basic, older, out of the way nail salon. You know the place doesn't get that much business when the pale pink you chose gets watered down with thinner between coats. The nail polishes were kind of old. $15 for a fill and I got a free soda.
