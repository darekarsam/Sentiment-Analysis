3	We had dinner outdoor patio, goulash and salad. The meal was average, the service was friendly. The average price per meal is a bit higher than what you would get in the city center which is about 10 min from car. We were staying at nearby hotel, tired and hungry after a long trip, so it served for an easy meal. The parking was easy, vs in downtown, you have to go to parking structure.
