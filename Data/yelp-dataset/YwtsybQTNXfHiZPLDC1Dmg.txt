5	This shop is fantastic! Everything was clean, organized, and easy to browse. The staff was extremely helpful - she took the time to find out exactly what I was looking for and pulled several items for me. I happened to catch them on a sale and walked out with 3 pair of maternity work pants, a belly band, and an oh so cute newborn hat for $10 total. Score!! I'll definitely be visiting again soon.
1	Stopped by today & doors were locked. There was a sign that had fallen on the ground saying closed until August but appears it was until June originally as August was written over June. This store is not opened nor should Yelp have it reflecting open.
