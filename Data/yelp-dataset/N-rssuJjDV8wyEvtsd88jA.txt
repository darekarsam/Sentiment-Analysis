5	Metz Home Inspection is not only affordable and professional but extremely thorough. The inspection was the least stressful experience of the home buying process. Luke took the time to patiently explain every aspect of my home to me, giving me a total understanding of what to expect. I would recommend Metz Home Inspection to anyone.
5	Spent several hours today with Metz Home Inspection and the experience was wonderful. Professional and thorough we had the full inspection report in our email inbox before we returned home. This is our first home purchase in Las Vegas so we have no prior vendors to rely on. We will certainly refer Luke Metz to friends and family if they are needing a home inspection.
5	My wife and I just recently closed escrow on our home and Metz Home Inspection did our inspection. Luke was completely thorough when inspecting our home. He checked all the outlets to the roof of the house. We went over everything that could potentially be a problem and he pointed out things in our home that were recently upgraded. At the end of it all we sat down and he went over the entire report. At the end I had no questions or concerns. I would recommend Metz Home Inspection highly to anyone.
5	We recently had Metz Home Inspection inspect a house that we were in the process of buying and couldn't be happier with our choice of inspectors. Luke was VERY thorough and knowledgeable. He not only took the time to go over his findings with us, but even went into details about ways to fix the things that he had discovered. We highly recommend Metz Home Inspection to anyone that is needing a home inspection. Thanks again Luke!Shaun & Lisa Friedrichs
