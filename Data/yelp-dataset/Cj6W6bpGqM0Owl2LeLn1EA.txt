5	We had these guys out to install a whole-house AC unit, and they did a great job. They're a local business that has been around for quite a while, and they still give the same care to their work that one would have expected back in the day. A small-town outfit that can hook you up with a nice efficiency AC unit.
5	Mr. Dill of Ray's Heating + Air Conditioning is a local legend.  Ray's is consistent in their care for customers, both old and new. They installed our A/C system  about 12 years ago- and continue to check it out prior to each summer cooling season. Very experienced, and polite too.  I highly recommend this Urbana, IL business!
1	Clean and polite and punctual. However, after supposedly fixing the furnace, it quit working that evening and they were closed for the weekend.  Had to call in another company who did fix the furnace.  Was still charged full amount by Ray's.
