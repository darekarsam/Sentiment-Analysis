5	I'm back In Vancouver now and find myself missing this gym, it had everything I needed and waaay more.  It's huge (and clean), with tons of equipment, has a shake and food bar, a shop with protein supplements and vitamins, but most importantly has an amazing room for boxing and kickboxing training.  Over the course of a few sessions I worked with a trainer named Matthew.  Though I'd been training in kickboxing for about 6 months I'd picked up some bad habits.  Matthew brought it back to basics for me and pushed me until I had given up nearly every shred of energy I had.  He's got a great demeanour without being forceful, making me want to work harder and harder, and he's got a great eye for body alignment, showing me subtle ways to get more out of my movements.  Next time I'm back in Montreal, however brief, I'll be sure to book a training session with him again.
3	Huge place, the biggest gym in the world apparently. Price is incredibly cheap so it's worth it. If only the staff at the front desk could smile and be a little nicer but I guess it's not included in the membership....
5	This gym has every equipment needed for a great workout and enough equipments for everyone , open 24h from Monday to Friday there is no excuse to miss my workout, friendly service and geez people are fit & get u going!
