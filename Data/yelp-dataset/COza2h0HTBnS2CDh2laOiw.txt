5	I ABSOLUTELY love this boutique! The clothes were made for divas in heaven, and the women in there were very polite and helpful! Great sales!
5	Stopped there one afternoon with my daughter and we are addicted. We love all the bling pieces and getting creative . We started with our iPhone chargers and now working on our  lap top cases and phones.My Girlfreind had a Birthday Party for her girls and it was a hit !!! The girls blinged mirrors and got to take home their creation.They also Cary lots of fun accessories , jewelry and will Bling any item you bring in.
