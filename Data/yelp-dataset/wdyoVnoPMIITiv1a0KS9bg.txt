4	Promising little bakery nestled in among the couple of businesses on this block of Rachel, directly across from the big church, a stone's throw from Jeanne Mance Park, goodie munching paradise. Its a tiny space, if there are quite a few people already inside you may need to wait outside until the space clears out. Friendly staff, delicious looking baked goods. We went in for the croissant festival only to be told we would have to wait for the next batch to be ready, so we decided to be adventurous and try out something different (almond chocolatine and Petit pain brioche). Trust me when I say the couple of goodies we tried were excellent! I will definitely be back to try out more more, there were some pieces of pie calling out to me, and decadent looking squares.
4	Perfect place to casser your croute after snowy activities on or around the Mont Royal!The staff was really nice, and the chocolatine was pretty good. I liked their very simple (but not lacking) menu of treats/snacks. I always love a small business that is dedicated to being...well...small. It's got all you need - a few chairs and sunny windows. No fuss.For me, it's a huge plus that they do not serve hipster coffee. Their coffee reminds me of the stuff I used to serve/drink in the early mid-2000's before everyone went insane and grew mustaches. And it's good.
