5	I've never had such a positive experience with a dental office in all my years, the staff is remarkable and the doctors are courteous and caring. I would recommend this office to everyone I know, it's as good as it gets as far as Dentists go. I can't wait until my next appointment.
5	I love going for my six month teeth cleaning. Cassie and Lily always make me feel like we have been friends for years. The whole staff really cares when your there.
5	My 8 year old son and I have been going here for a couple years and I really like this place.  They are exactly what I want in a Dr/Dentist office:  Friendly, fair and professional.  The dentists make my son very comfortable and the front staff (esp. Cassie) have been overly courteous in spite of my having to reschedule several times.  I used to go to Vibrant Dentistry in Mesa but they got so expensive and recommended work that turned out to be unnecessary.  I trust the folks here.
