5	Employees are very friendly and quite entertaining.  The place is stocked with various packing supplies.  Although the office is small, the employees really hustle and get you in and out.  Well done, tiny lil' post office!
2	Nice to have a US Post Office, but only when they are OPENED!  Maricopa's office has doctor's hours, they open late and close early!  I almost killed myself driving home one day to get there to pick up an important letter and they were already closed before 5:00pm!  This is where all our hard earned tax payer's money goes to?  They don't even have a Stamp Machine or Kiosk for help, any forms to fill out to prep your boxes or even ship out labels in the lobby. I have been to better equipped Post Offices and this is not one of them.
3	The staff is friendly but this little post office struggles to accommodate the growth in Maricopa.  Parking is terrible and the lines are always present.
