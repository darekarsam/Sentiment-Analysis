2	Not a fan !!! Just another company with a fancy slogan and web page !! If u have little projects it's kind of a waste of their time , is exactaly how they made me feel ! We will see if they pay attention enough to get the job done right .....
5	Great service! I used them for a classic car restoration 5 years ago, and all my parts I sent to Powder Coating Plus are still in great shape.  Their attention to detail and service are great.  Adam was very easy to work with.
5	Powder coating plus is one of the best vendors we have.  They get our product in right away and we never have any issues. Everything always comes out looking amazing. Their quality control is impeccable.  They are great to work with. We wouldn't take our stuff anywhere else. We only take it to the best and they are definitely the best! Thank you guys for all your hard work. We love you at All Metal maintenance stands.
5	Adam and his team are clearly professional.  I've had them do some tough jobs for me and they have come out perfect every time.  The prices are very competitive and probably the best in town.  Best not just in price but in quality and customer service.
