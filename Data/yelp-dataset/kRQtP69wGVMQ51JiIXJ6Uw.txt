4	A great stop if you want to get some cheap pizza to cook at home for the family, but also want to pick up some Thai food next door at Thai Basil.The staff is very friendly, and you can typically get out of there in under 5 minutes even when it's busy.  Otherwise you can call ahead, and even use the drive-through window if you prefer.They typically have monthly specials, and you can easily get coupons if you sign up for their email list.We prefer the deLITE style of pizza because it's a cracker-style crust, they use a different tomato sauce, and it's not overloaded with toppings.  You can also shave off about 100 calories per slice that way, to make room for beer.
4	You are always pleasantly greeted when you first walk in. I really enjoy the garlic chicken pizza and my kids are fans of the pepperoni or sausage pizza (depending on the day). Staff always ask if you have any questions about baking the pizza before you leave and everything is made within minutes. Priced well, but only after using their coupons.
3	I tried to order a pizza for a family member who lives in Madison (I live in a different state) who just got out of the hospital. However, Papa Murphy's doesn't take payments over the phone and they don't have the option to order on their website (at least not on the mobile site).  This is pretty pathetic for a business in this modern-day. Please offer payment over the phone or on your website at the very least.I had to take my business elsewhere (in this case, Toppers, which was very accommodating, and no this isn't a paid ad for them, I just feel like they should get a pat-on-the-back for accommodating my order when Papa Murphy's couldn't).Papa Murphy's, please embrace technology - it's a great thing!
