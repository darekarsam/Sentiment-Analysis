5	We had some minor repair work to fix a leak in our clay tile roof. I called Johnson Roofing and Tyler Johnson called me back and we made an appointment for him to come see the roof the same day. He climbed on to the roof, assessed the problem  and gave me a preliminary idea of the damage, the solution and the cost to fix it., which he followed up with a written estimate. They came to do the work two days later, were at my house for about 4 hours, fixed the roof and cleaned up after themselves. Outstanding!
5	I was really impressed with how Johnson Roofing performed the services.  They made a first analysis and gave me plenty of options to fit in our price range and budget.  I felt that they were very fair, while providing an excellent repair service.  I would recommend Johnson Roofing to my friends above all else.
5	Easy to work with, great pricing and solid work. They really know what they are doing. Watched several houses in the area being done and Johnson Roofing's crew was like clockwork and got the job done sooner than the other houses and it looked better in quality and attention to detail.
5	excellent work from start to finish!  (which was only one day for the entire remove-and-replace of my 1200sf ranch)  ...we had previously been burned by a disreputable roofing company, but tyler was consistently patient and understanding through my many questions, and helped me work through hiccups with insurance payment(s) long after the work had been completed.the crew was efficient and deliberate in their methods, and they left the jobsite almost exactly as they had arrived (except, of course, for the beautiful new roof).  tyler was always available to answer questions about the project before they got underway, as well as after completion.finding a roofer can be a daunting task, but i would strongly recommend you allow johnson roofing to take a look at your project and find out, first hand, just how easy roof replacement can be...
