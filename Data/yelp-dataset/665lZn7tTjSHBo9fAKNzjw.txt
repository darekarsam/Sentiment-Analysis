5	This is where I bought my wife's wedding and engagement rings. They came with lifetime warranties and lifetime cleaning and re-dipping for free at any Kay Jewelers nationwide. Also where I got my un-scratch-able tungsten wedding band. The people in all 3 of the shops I've been in are really nice.
5	We always get such great service when we come here. From taking our jewelry in for inspections when needed to purchasing new items or sending out items for sizing or fixing they have always been nice, reasonably priced and prompt.They even have a thing where you can always trade up on your diamonds. May do that in the future with my Blue diamond earrings :)We will be back
1	Very slow service, over 55 minutes to check out . Lady did not know what she's doing.
