1	DO NOT send your loved one here!!!! The most unprofessional unethical uneducated administration EVER!!!! May Abby & Bina enjoy the bad karma coming your way. Absolutely AWFUL demons
1	This facility is horrible!! Doesn't even deserve one star. I would not send anyone I loved (or hated for that matter!) to this center..This place, I realized, lacks in all  professionalism & care for ANYTHING, let alone their patients. As a previous employee for a similar care & rehab center in Iowa, I know the drill. The receptionist, (an older woman with shorter, silver hair) was the only good experience of the whole visit. She looked nice, was kind, professional & very knowledgeable. She helped us find where we were going & made sure, when she saw my husband & I again, asked if we got to where we needed to go without any trouble. Honestly, after the front door, everything went downhill. FAST. Ever heard of  "while the cat is away, the mice will play"? It was just that. The stations looked like it had no supervision. I saw many "help lights" on, but the nurses looked as if they were too busy just standing & sitting around, screwing off, talking & laughing with each other... all this while the phones rang off-the-hook! I even saw one Indian looking lady turn the ringer down & roll her eyes. (?) I was in utter disbelief.  I feel sorry for anyone that has been placed under the "care" of this staff. I am curious to know how many discharge AMAs there have been at this one facility. I sure wouldn't blame anyone. The food, as well as the people working in the kitchen, looked gross. I don't doubt the kitchen looked disgusting & was unsanitary, based on everything else we saw while we were there. Whoever is in charge, is clearly not doing their job!! Life Care Center of Paradise Valley should be reported to the Better Business Bureau, immediately.
