5	Excellent welders, good to work with, and reliable. I would recommend them to anyone.
1	Horrible customer service! Went in on a Monday to get an estimate to have 100 pieces of square tube custom fabricated. The lady in the office was very nice that's the only reason I'm giving 1 star. No one was there to give an estimate so she said they'd call me back later with it. No one called! Called next day was told again someone will call you back today or tomorrow with the estimate. No one called!! Called back 2 days later on Thursday and was told still no one has looked at it yet to give you an estimate!! Really? 4 days not one person could take a look at this simple job and give me an estimate! Wow! Unbelievable!! Was then told  sorry maybe you should try somebody else! Don't know who's in charge but they are clueless on how to run a business! My business we NEVER turn people away NEVER!!
