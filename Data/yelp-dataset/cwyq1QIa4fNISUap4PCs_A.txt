3	Castle Place is your standard take-out-only Chinese restaurant. The location is a little bit run down, and I expected the food to be pretty bad, but my wife and I were sick of Sesame Inn and decided to try something new. Overall the food is hit or miss--some nights are better than others, probably depending on which member of the family that owns the place is cooking--but when it's good it's really very good. Good: We particularly like the General Tso's tofu, which has a great texture. Bad: The pot-stickers are often under-fried.
