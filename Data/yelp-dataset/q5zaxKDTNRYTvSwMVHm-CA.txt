4	I've been a client of Hed Salon for almost 5 years now, I've been having my hair cut by Gabrielle since I started coming here and I have to say she does a great job. She always comes up with suggestion on how to make me look like I have more hair then I really do and always has interesting conversation.The support staff is also very nice, I'm always treated like I'm the most important person in the place and they are quick to offer up a drink once your hair has been washed or if you get there early and find yourself having to answer some email and read the paper. I like this place for the simple reason that I've been coming here for five years and even with the staff changes they manage to keep the experience and fun. Give them a try ask for Gabie when you book your appointment.
