4	Great place to bring your dog for a trim. Quick to get an appointment. Sometimes these places can have quite the waiting list. But 2 days is fast. This being said I don't buy pets from a pet store.
3	This pet store isn't for me, but I do appreciate that it doesn't focus only on cats and dogs (but i have a cat).This place has a lot to offer if you are a reptile or fish owner, much more than any other pet store I've visited in Montreal. As for mammals, the selection and variety was rather small. Staff seemed to be helpful.
1	I just had to take to some kind of social media because I can not believe dogs (and cats) are being sold and held in such sad conditions. (As opposed as sold at a breeder at a farm). Nothing wrong with the store, but having a puppy 24/7 in a "aquarium like" cage is just beyond belief!
1	Took our two dogs today to have their nails clipped. I'm appalled at the treatment they received. The woman took out clippers, sat on the floor in the front of the store and clipped their nails as my boyfriend and I held our squirming, crying, yelping pups. No gloves. No professionalism. No private room. BOTH of our dogs ended up bleeding and crying. Bleeding so badly that after we got them home we had to go back to store and buy more Quick Blood Stopper. BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE
