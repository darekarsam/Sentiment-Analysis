3	People have asked me why I like going to Wendy's for a burger.  You could go to McDonalds instead.   (And I do, often for breakfast.)  Or you could go to Burger King, for a Whopper (which I do, on Wednesdays, because it's only $1.99 for the Whopper, plus applicable taxes).  But there is a good reason to go to Wendy's.The reason I go to Wendy's is for a Grand Slam.There's a 1/4 pound Single.  There's a 1/2 pound Double.  There's a 3/4 pound Triple.  These burgers are on the menu.  The Grand Slam is an off-menu 1 pound quadruple burger that will satiate your desires for a four-patty dose of awesome.  A challenge for many, the Grand Slam is the winner for the meat-lover in your family when they want a burger.Plus, you can have a Frosty after your burger... something i definitely recommend.
1	Don't know why I went here. I wanted try something new, but it wasn't on the menu so I went with the spicy chicken. When I got it, it was flat like a pancake with one mushy tomato and a piece of old lettuce. Not to mention really salty. I think in going to be drinking water all might now. When I ordered I had to pull up and wait 5 minutes. At least it was hot.
2	Every time we go the staff seem annoyed or too busy to show any proper cx service standards.   They "huff" when you ask for a tray ( 3 drinks... No tray ? ) and when you get home you realize they have either given you the wrong order, you didn't get the right drink, or the fries you ordered total 15. Get your stuff together #wendy Teach your staff better standards if you actually want to improve.
