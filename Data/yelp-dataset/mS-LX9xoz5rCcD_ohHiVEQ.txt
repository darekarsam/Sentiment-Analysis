5	Great place to get nails done. $20 for spa pedicure. The lady that worked on my feet did an incredible job. She was very thorough. For extra $5, I also added lemon scrub that smelled great and the massage I received was just perfect - long with the right pressure. This place is not fancy but their pedicure is better than in many places where you pay $40 and up. Highly recommended.
5	I love this little place! The prices are excellent and so is the service. The leg massage with my pedi was to die for!
5	Got there with my daughter and could just walk in. Daughter got acrylic nails for 35 $ and for me they did manicure deluxe with gel for 25$. Very lovely couple and good service!
