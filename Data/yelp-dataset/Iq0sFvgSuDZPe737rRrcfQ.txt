5	Great place,great owner...will give you samples to try should you decide you like the product and will buy it later. Tried her cucumber soap... lovely and smells like the real deal, not of chemicals. Her sandalwood smelled so wonderful, I scooped up a few bars immediately! She also graciously gave me a sandalwood incense stick to try at home and told me she only uses natural oils, no fillers (sawdust, resins etc) , which is why her sticks don't look like those you normally see. Tried it that evening, loved the scent. Her products are natural and handmade, she carries a variety of herbs and spices as well as teas. This another of my go- to places.
