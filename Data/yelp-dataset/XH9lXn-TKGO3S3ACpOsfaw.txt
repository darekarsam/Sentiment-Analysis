4	This is a smaller subway, good seating, not a very big lunch crowd when i went; parking is cramped cause of other stores in same strip.  Just ur average Subway :)
2	I walked in, no one was inside working. I waited about 10 minutes before someone peeked their head around the corner while I was on the way out to get a meal elsewhere. I figured, screw it, I'm already here. I want Subway. The Sandwich Artist finally appeared. Might as well get a sub. The guy working there was creepy but generally friendly (and also seemed high as a kite), but he honored our coupon even though they didn't technically "accept" them. I've had this happen in the past at this location where the Sandwich Artist has left the building (different guy though). I'm not sure where the manager is, but s/he doesn't seem to give a crap what goes down there.
1	I was in there yesterday prior to work and as I looked down In the food assembly area I viewed a like cockroach.  Needless to say I didn't pay for the sub because my appetite was diminished at that point.  Perhaps they can take a more proactive approach and have a licensed pest control company spray more often.  A time before this incident saw a live  fly in the work station before he landed on the food prep area.
4	I just wanted to put this comment out there.  I went to this location for the first time today.  The customer service was excellent.  The best I've ever had.  My food was delicious, once I was done one of the co-workers offered to throw it away for me and told me to drive safely when I was leaving.  Never experienced any of that before.  Definitely recommend this one
5	Super fast and friendly service. Good soup as well. Mmmmm... Broccoli cheddar. Best subway location in Phoenix.
