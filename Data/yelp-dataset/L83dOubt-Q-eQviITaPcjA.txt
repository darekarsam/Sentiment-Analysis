1	Only gave them one star because zero wasn't an option!!!!  I had a very unpleasant experience with the owner of this business today.  We drove from Chicago to Madison to meet with Terri regarding flowers for our wedding, after confirming our appointment time and location via e-mail.  When we got there nobody was there.  We waited for 30 minutes, called and left a message, left and came back after another 20 minutes and called again, and still she didn't show.  No phone call, no e-mail, nothing.  I suspect she bailed on us because our small floral budget wasn't worth her time, but who knows. Barring some serious emergency (and if that's the case I WILL update this review if I hear from her), her behavior was extremely unprofessional and I would not recommend using this florist. Extremely disappointed.9/4/11 Update:  She e-mailed today to say she forgot, because she's exhausted and has a cold.  But apparently not too exhausted to keep her from going to the movies with her husband instead, which is where she tells me she was while I was standing in her parking lot in the rain waiting for her.Seriously?
5	Terri was an amazing find to do our flowers in Madison. She did a great job helping a bride that knew very litter about flowers and wanted to keep the budget down with a 250 person wedding and a huge wedding party. At the consultation Terri took the few ideas I had, and created a list of flowers both wild in her own gardens and that she could get from other local vendors to help me reach the vision I wanted at the budget I wanted. The flowers turned out to be beautiful and Terri was a pleasure to work with. I would highly recommend her
