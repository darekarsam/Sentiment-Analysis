4	This review is long overdue but I've had a bit of a love/hate relationship with Smithies for a while.  This is because it's my man's favourite pub.  It's like Cheers for him in that whenever he goes there he seems to know at least a handful of the people there and almost inevitably ends up staying much later than planned, drinking too much, coming home steaming, and eventually giving me puppy dog eyes in the morning as he asks for tea and bacon to cleanse his liver.But, I have to admit, Smithies is a really good pub.  It's a total old man boozer (despite the fact that it sells what is apparently very nice champagne?!?!), but not in a smelly way, just in a really friendy way.  Everyone who works behind the bar is family - dad, mum, son and daughter, which gives it a really nice vibe.  They all obviously care about their establishment as well as their customers.     The pints are good and reasonably priced, even the food is nice.  It's basic pub fare of soup and toasties but is well done.  Smithies is a great relaxed pub hidden away in Canonmills.  If you happen to find yourself in here and notice a baldy Glaswegian whose voice carries across county lines, tell him to go home, his girlfriend doesn't want him too hungover in the morning.
