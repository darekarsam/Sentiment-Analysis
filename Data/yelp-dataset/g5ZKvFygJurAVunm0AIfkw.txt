4	Fast in , Fast out but I like it. Free parking and no stress. Would love  a bathroom in the building but hey, that would be just to perfect.  Much nicer than running down to Charlotte with all that traffic
3	This airport was alright for being a local airport.  I seriously didn't know what to expect.  I had used Allegiant Air here and the check in was pretty simple in a hanger.  Security check was nice and quick.  I didn't use the restroom while I was there, but I think that you had to go outside to another area to use it.  So I can't really vouch for the cleanliness of that.  The waiting area was alright.  They did have a lot of fold-able chairs.  A little uncomfortable for long waits, but I didn't mind since I had bought the cheapest ticket that I could find.  It was nice that they had free wifi, and had the password printed out and taped up for all to see and use.  So kudos for that.  What I liked the most was that there were some outlets that I was able in order to charge my iphone.  When boarding the plane for Allegiant, we had to walk out to the runway to get to the plane.  I'm glad that I got on before it started raining.  All in all, I got what I paid for, so I'm content with what was there for a local airport.

First, it's only 10 minutes from our house. How awesome is that? Second, parking is 50 yards from the terminal, and free. We flew Allegiant Air, which has it's own terminal. A hangar actually. We were through security in 5 minutes, bags checked and boarding passes scanned. The terminal had large heating fans set up to keep the air warm, which was nice in late December. There were vending machines set up to replace everything that had to be thrown away before the security checkpoint. A great place to catch a flight if you want to avoid the hassles of CLT.
