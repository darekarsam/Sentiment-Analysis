5	Both my children have been or are currently attending swim lessons here. I love it and more importantly they love going! Staff is absolutely wonderful and pricing is reasonable. Class times are flexible too! I highly recommend this swim school.
5	Both my boys leaned to swim here, it is a great location with great people.  My oldest son first went to Hubbard years back but he never learned and was way more money.  This place is hidden in the back of this business area but very close to 75 ave & Deer Valley.
