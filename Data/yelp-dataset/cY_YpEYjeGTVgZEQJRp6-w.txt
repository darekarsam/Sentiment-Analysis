5	As someone else said, you've got to call these guys on "Wacky Wednesdays".  Even the specialty pizzas are half price.  With that said, price alone doesn't make this place great.  We ordered the "Pittsburgh Steak Pizza", the "BBQ Chicken Pizza", and a plain cheese pizza for the kids.  The cheese pizza was good, but the Pittsburg and BBQ pizzas were out of this world.  I haven't had a chance to order anything else on the menu but if the Pizza is any indication of overall quality then I can't imagine not likening the hoagies and such.The Pittsburgh Pizza was unique enough that I'm giving this place a 5 star rating.  I tend to only give 5 stars to places that are good and/or unique enough that I'd take people from out of town there to eat.  If you are looking for something a little different, and very tasty, give Pizzeria Primos a shot!
1	Been ordering from them a long time, but lately their prices seem to have increased A LOT. We got wings, a hoagie, and onion rings and the bill was nearly $35.00. Cheaper to just get in the car and go out. Bottom line is there are lots of places nearby that serve food like theirs for less money.
