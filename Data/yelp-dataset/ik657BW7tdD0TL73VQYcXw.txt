5	One of the biggest pains of moving is finding all new services, like a mechanic. Go HERE. Ask for DOUG. Doug kicks butt. He is the most HONEST mechanic I have ever met and doesn't talk to you like you are a moron just because you are a chick.
4	Very happy with my service here.  Guys got me in quickly, diagnosed my problem quick and then offered me a full-price solution or the option of a cheaper fix - which is a nice option to have.Price was exactly what they quoted me.Got these guys from a recommendation, so I'd say they're a safe bet.Thanks!
5	I just moved to Madison and took my Honda Accord in for a fuel emmissions leak. He was very honest and descriptive and told me that it is not a huge problem and that I am better off saving my $ than getting it fixed. This was the second opinion that I got (I went to Terry's Car Care first and they told me that to go any further it would cost atleast $400 and that I might need a new gas tank). Morale of the story...take your car here!
5	I love Foreign Car Specialists.  Their prices are reasonable, they explain the work well, they often dissuade me from something I think I need, and they're really nice.  Aaron and Doug have both been great.  I just wish they worked on Fords, so we could bring our other car to them.
4	Really helpful and honest! Definitely going back for future repairs.
