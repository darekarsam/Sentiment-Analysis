4	Wow! What a nice surprise. The new Quartier des Spectacles is so nice now, especially with Brasserie T and Bar F. Who would think that this small little entrance at the top of the stairs hid such a gem! It's at the top of the MAC. Beautiful, well lit scenery. It was very quiet for a Friday night. Because of the rain ? It's fun to see the colourful light patterns and hear music from the museum below. Service is attentive. Plates are beautifully presented (the Chef is the Grandson of a painter). The food is very good. Nothing fancy or exotic, but really delicious. The wine list is interesting, with a good choice of wines by the glass, decently priced.I understand it's a bit out of the way, but it's really worth looking for!
