2	Veggies aren't even tasty (Thai noodles tasted like as it was cooked after pork) but the meat are good (according to my daughter as I'm a vegetarian). Fried rice are stale and tasteless. Filled the carryout box with Thai noodles, fried rice and veg in sauce, cost $7.  Not worth $, even at mall eatery area.

Okay, maybe I will make this part of my run for that badge you get for going to places with 2 or less star reviews.  Really, though, after getting a sample of their mango chicken, I decided to go with that and some pineapple and shrimp fried rice. I have to say that my food was really cooked well and flavorful.  My chicken was light without being over breaded and I was given huge portions!  I ate leftovers for dinner the next night.Ruby Thai is located in Carolina Place food court, so you may want to check it out during your next shopping visit in the neighborhood.  The service was very friendly, and surprisingly, they had mashed potatoes as an option among all of the various Asian fare.  I really had to ask about this, since I found it rather amusing.  Mashed potatoes, they assured me were added after several customer requests.  Have to say, listening to your customers is a plus in my book!
1	Wonton soup is terrible. I don't know what I expected for mall food but yuck. Broth tasted gamey and the wontons themself just looked bad. Couldn't even bring myself to try one.
