4	Was there on Jan 10, 2011. Haven't got a haircut from super cut forever!!! The two last girls running the store during the few mins of closing were awesome! And pretty cute too! Just wish super cut lowers their prices again.
2	Slow and impersonal. Decent prices but I will not bring my daughter back to this location. If you're not happy with your job, do something or go someplace else.
5	If you're stopping in,ask for Madison. She cuts my hair every time I'm in and she's fantastic! Super personable and friendly as well.
5	The young lady (Amanda) did a great job on my hair. She cut it so you can barely tell it's been cut, although there was a lot of hair on the floor, proving otherwise. Still, I figured in about a week, my hair will grow in and it will look really, really great. Also, my hair seems to do the alfalfa and I don't like that. I was glad she did what she could to minimize that. Glad to use this particular store as it doesn't seem to get much turnover so I can pretty much rely on my good haircutter if I feel they are doing a good job. Not so much so, with some of the other stores.
