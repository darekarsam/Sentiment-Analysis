5	I had a procedure done with Dr. Olson and had a fantastic experience. He was very knowledgeable and professional. I felt very comfortable during our consultation and felt that he was giving me the best recommendations for me and my situation. His staff was very kind and professional as well. My results after surgery are exactly what I wanted and I am very pleased. I would recommend Dr. Olson and his practice to anyone!
5	Dr. Olson and his staff are fantastic. From the moment I met him,  I knew that I chose the right surgeon and would be in terrific hands. He's very professional and took the time to answer all of my questions and make me feel at ease. After the surgery, Dr. Olson and his staff followed up numerous times to check on me. These days where house calls are unheard of, Dr. Olson was there. I had no complications at all and I do think that has a lot to do with the amazing work of Dr. Olson. I would highly recommend Dr. Olson!
5	Dr. Olson and his entire staff are top notch. We went to four consultations regarding the procedure and none of them compared to what the Advanced Plastic Surgery Institute provided. Dr. Olson and his staff spent hours pre procedure going over all of our questions and making this a comfortable experience. Post surgery, Dr. Olson and his staff checked in numerous times to see how things were going. You can tell from the first meeting how much care Advanced Plastic Surgery Institute provides to their clients. Amazing work from an amazing team!
