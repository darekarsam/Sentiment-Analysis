5	These guys are great.I had to have a colonoscopy done and went to this store to get the necessary prep materials. The pharmacist saw me looking confusedly at the products and knew exactly what I was there for. Not only did he help me get the right products, he also gave me some of the more expensive tablets for free so I wouldn't have to buy a whole bottle. This place will have definitely my future business. Its got a great neighborhood feel, friendly staff, and provides pharmaceutical convenience for people living in Bloomfield.
5	Best drugs in town!
5	When it comes to Jim and the pharmacy area, five stars are not enough.  Jim is just a nice down to earth guy.  I have live in Bloomfield for almost 25 years.  I only talked to Jim about five times.  Every time I talked to him he always treated me with respect and never talked down to me for not following the doctors orders.   When Jim talks to you, he literally leaves the back counter and stands next to you.  He is a pharmist that really listens to everybody, even strangers.  This place is always very sparkling clean and organize.  I almost gave this places four star rating  The only reason  because of "a couple" of the cashiers. In the past I have heard couple of the older cashier talk about customers.  However  95% most of them are beyond super nice.  Since everything else is beyond excellent, it gets five stars!
