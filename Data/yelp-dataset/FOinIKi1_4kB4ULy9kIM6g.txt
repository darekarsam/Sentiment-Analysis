5	Johnathan came and made a new ignition key for my 95 nissan pathfinder. He was professional and made me two extra keys because the cut for me key was very difficult.  If you ever need a car key made give him a call.
5	Excellent work!!! He came so quick to my business. I lost my keys to my 04 Honda Civic and it needed a laser cut key or I couldn't start the car. He provided one quickly and even program it to my alarm for me because I couldn't start the car without it I highly recommend him ,he'll do a great job
5	I needed an emergency rekey after someone's stole my realtors lockbox from my house I was selling. It was late and everyone was pushing me to the next day. After calling several companies that wanted to charge me a ridiculous amount of money I got ahold of Johnny Locksmith. The dispatch girl gave me a very accurate estimate over the phone so I had a good idea of what I was looking at which was very competitively priced. Refael arrived in an extremely reasonable amount time and was very friendly and helpful. I will absolutely, without hesitation, refer him to friends and family and when I need a locksmith again he will be my go to guy.
