5	Great Cut, styling and low liGhts very affordable will have you going back again And Again. I have curly hair and the stylist had no problem with it. They give you their expert opinion but will also not deviate from your wishes. Ask for adriana or ricky-there are other sylists there but I haven't tried them.

3	Located inside Desert Sky. The girl who did my hair did it okay but seemed like she'd rather be somewhere else and didn't really seem engaged and helpful. No tip for her. I went with my sister and my sis got a girl who seemed very helpful and offered hair tips and was really sweet. Mine seemed like she wanted to go as fast as she could, didn't care about me or my hair and she didn't even ask me if my hair looked okay after she was done. Cuts are a pretty standard price, every month they have specials which they display near the entrance. Overall a decent place. I think they could have some better customer service. I pass by this place sometimes and I see almost nobody  inside. Might just go to Supercuts next time...
1	Jesus did my hair. I hadn't realized he was brand new.The haircut itself was fine. He did ask a lot of questions like where should the top layer start,  end, etc which was a little unsettling since he's the "professional"...At one point,  the conversation became unprofessional and then he answered his phone while cutting my hair! What?! Of course that was when he was cutting my bangs. They look awful. I asked him to fix it and he didn't know how. I like the rest of my haircut but c'mon my bangs is all people can see and focus on.Suggestions on where I can go to fix them?
