1	Don't come here. They keep one of those predatory tow companies on standby and if you so much as step away from your vehicle to use the bathroom, they will swoop in, hitch up your car, and tow it away. Don't come here just because it's close to the hospital. If you need gas, there's a Citgo, Shell, and BP all under a mile away - prices are usually a little better (except for the BP) and they're cleaner too.
2	I personally feel that "some" of the employees extremely rude.  I have heard some employees literally scream at customers.  One lady apologized for something she dropped and she's repeatedly apologized while cleaning it up.  The one employees glared and screamed at this lady.  Now, some employees are super nice.
2	I do agree that the customer service inside is completely lacking. This is why I don't bother going in anymore. I just get gas and that's it. Usually the gas prices are competitive with the others in the area. The area is very tight near the pumps..where sometimes it's hard to access the ones in the middle.
