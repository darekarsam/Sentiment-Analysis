5	I am so glad that my sister-in-law made me sign up! It is only class one and man am I feeling it! The staff is extremely nice and helpful! You can tell they are very passionate about their job and want to help you get the results your shooting for.Prices are a little steep but honestly it is worth it. It is a great way to let out a lot of stress and steam! I cannot wait to go back and sign up for a full membership!
5	How is it that one gym can possess all the greatest trainers in the known universe? I am baffled by it. The trainers that run this gym are fantastic. They are upbeat and positive, while still being genuine. In that they don't annoy the crap out of you with the normal personal trainer BS. Just that fake, inattentive, jargon that you can get out of a workout DVD.You are being personally trained. The trainers actually take the time to learn your name. They watch you and somehow keep track of everyone in the class, your strengths and weaknesses. If you go often enough they certainly remember your level between classes. They constantly encourage your strengths so you know what you are doing right. They also remind you of what you do wrong, but in a very courteous, straight-to-the-point, non-judgmental way. I love that they aren't afraid to correct you.You are getting personally trained at a bargain price of around $3-$7 a class. Plus they don't focus on you constantly so you don't get performance anxiety! That's why personal training doesn't work (too much attention for too short of a time... in this class you get attention in short bursts).This is the perfect workout class mostly because of the trainers. But the simple gym setup, music and atmosphere are also all perfect. I hope to get into more advanced MMA training, but I think I will always keep a membership here, due to the friendly atmosphere and endlessly challenging but fun workouts.
