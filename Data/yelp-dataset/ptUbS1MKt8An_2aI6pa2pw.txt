4	football nation is a good shop with all the things a top football fan would want.It has some of the latest fashion in football like new tops and balls and others.The staff are polite and friendly.
3	I'm not known for my extensive knowledge on football, but I used to dabble in it when I was a wee lassie and this place seemed alright.Following the comedown of the world cup and with the beginning of the new season beckoning, I didn't see that many foreign strips. What they did have were an extensive range of football colours from across the UK, and some football shoes. They had the classic Adidas Samba that my football playing ex used to salivate over, and considering he got into a few scrapes when he played fives I can testify to the good service these shoes do. And in a shallow way, they do look rather nice.I didn't know that they made football strips up for teams as Robert has outlined. I did notice it was leaning towards more expensive, but sometimes independent places like that have more vairety than the high street or internet shopping. Definitely worth keeping your eyes peeled on this one.
