5	Sparkling new and friendly store right in Cotswold Village.  There's even a Starbucks right next door.  Too bad Starbucks isn't B-Y-O-B-ooze!
4	Clean, shiny, and stocked! This location always has what I'm after. They don't have restrooms for the public, though. If you gotta go while you're shopping, pop in Starbucks next door.
