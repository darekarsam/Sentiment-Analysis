5	I am from Chicago and I have to say WCD has the best Italian beef sandwich I have ever had in Arizona! The Chicago dog was excellent as.well. Nice setting a little hard to find as it sits in the middle of a park (Gateway in El Mirage) and there is little signage on the road but great all the same.
3	I had the Italian beef sandwich   It's hard to compare because they are just flat out hard to find outside Chicago.  I will say it was a bit short of being anything I would call authentic you could be disappointed if you've been to Chicago. They do however sell real authentic ingredients to make your own Chicago dogs.  Pretty much nothing more than a hot dog stand at a skate park.
3	Great place to have lunch with the kids... Food is okay, but I've had better... The hot dogs are a worthy treat, but the tamales are disappointing...
5	Hard to find. It's tucked behind solar panels on Cinnabar, it's not on El Mirage. It was pretty good overall!
5	Absolutely great with kids good food great prices and one amazing Italian beef sandwich!!! It's a must try when your at el mirage park!!!!
2	Good for kids.  Windy City Dogs features Vienna Beef hot dogs. This restaurant is local, and I like  to support small businesses.I have spent some time in Chicago and have had my fair share of hotdogs.  At Windy City dogs you can get a traditional Chicago dog on a  poppy seeded bun, peppers, pickle spear, tomato slices, fluorescent green relish ?, chopped onion, and celery salt.Windy City Dogs offers a  variety of toppings and if you don't like beef dogs, there is Polish sausage, tamales, corndogs, nachos, and Italian beef sandwiches. On this visit I had the tamale and to be honest it was very disappointing and nothing like tamales I am accustomed to.  Prices range from inexpensive to ridiculously cheap. This is a great place to bring kids, I myself am not a hot dog fan so I am trying to be very objective. Eat in or take out, its up to you. Service is fast and friendly.
