5	I had a serious problem with my plumbing at my home in Tempe.  The Orangeburg pipe had been breached by the roots of a tree that was searching for water.  It caused my toilets, tubs, and sinks to back up and made a huge mess.  It was so bad we considered moving.  I called my brother for a recommendation on a plumber.  He had been using Bulldogs Plumbing for his house and business for years, so I called Steve and he came out the next morning.  We had to call in a camera crew to crawl the pipe and see what was the problem.  That's when we discovered the roots had busted through and were causing the problem.  Bulldogs was fast and efficient and told me exactly what was going on the entire time.  I have used them since on my rental properties and would recommend them to any friends or family.
5	AWESOME PROS!!!  We hired Bulldogs for a MAJOR high-rise double condo rebuild in downtown Phoenix. We had identified some  huge obstacles that appeared to be insurmountable, i.e. IMPOSSIBLE!!! We called BULLDOGS!!  Steve, Mark, Oscar came to our rescue. There are no "problems" with them, only "solutions"!!  The "obstacles" that they managed to overcome/resolve were nothing short of the work of a Magician!! We do a lot of building and renovations. Believe me, these guys are professional, efficient, quick, knowledgeable, and experienced!! We have never worked with a better group of subs on any job!!
