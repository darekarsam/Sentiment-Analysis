5	I have been going to most of their auctions for the last 3 or so years (ever since a neighbor told me about them). I have bought a few things over the years and (much to my wife's dismay) , I bought an animatronic fullsize GORILLA in the recent March auction! They mostly auction off Slot Machines, Juke Boxes and advertising signs and lights, but they always seem to have something REALLY OFFBEAT in each auction! Fun stuff! When I was picking up my Gorilla I saw a life-size Abraham Lincoln coming out for the October auction. I hope I am in town for their next auction.My monkey needs a friend!
5	Victorian Casino Antiques is a fun place to attend when the auctions are happening. And they have great collectible items, perfect for that "man cave" for the boys and great design items for visual effects in one's home. Lastly, the people who work there are great and very service oriented. I bought a antique trunk and a Disneyland poster from there. Check it out, either via internet or in person!
1	Here goes my post.I bid online through PROXIBID, after the auction was over we agreed on a Cashier Check, I had won another item through another site I had forgotten about.So they won't ship my first item until they receive payment, they are holding my item hostage until they get their money!Now I know why. I paid $96 for shipping two boxes, they packed everything into one box and shipped by FedEx and paid $36.11, yes I asked FedEx what it cost. I want a refund for the second box.Someone please step forward and tell what is really going on here.
