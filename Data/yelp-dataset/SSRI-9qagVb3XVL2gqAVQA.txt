5	I stopped here yesterday afternoon and glad I did! Since I moved to Vegas my love for tacos has reached a whole new level. So naturally I like doing a little research and trying new places. This place is just west of Maryland Parkway on the north end of Charleston. Everything on the menu is priced cheap. All tacos are $0.99, except the Lengua and Tripa ($1.25). I started my meal with 2 tacos and a burrito, both Pastor. For a total of $6.00 this was a steal. The tacos are a little small but for $0.99 how can one complain about size when it tastes so dang good? When served the pastor was on top of a perfectly made tortilla. As for toppings, they have a full salsa bar with many options. I made my tacos with some pico and pineapple salsa, bomb. Next came the burrito. Inside it contained pastor, rice, beans, cilantro, cheese all wrapped in a warm tortilla. I'm not gonna lie, I was pretty hungry and ate these with ease and had room. So.. I got 2 more tacos for Round 2. This time around I tired the Asada with cilantro, onion, and their red salsa. These were also very good! Both meats I tried were moist, tender, and very good. The tortillas speak for themselves. I'm already making plans to come here again once I'm in the neighborhood.
