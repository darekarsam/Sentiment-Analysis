5	Alien Hall was the best thing I could've asked for as a freshman at U of I.Lots of GDI's (goddamn independents), a decent dining hall (clean and comfy - booths - very restauranty) and close to Paradiso and That's Rentertainment.I spent many a night outside with fellow porch rats. Discussing, smoking, listening, smoking and smoking some more. The people I met within the first two weeks at Allen remained my core group of friends throughout college (and beyond).I can't believe I had this place down as my third choice. (the six pack was closer to the art building). I don't know where or how I would've ended up without Allen.
2	Unless you're a hipster, avoid this place.The food was nasty, the facilities were old and dirty (many thanks to the disgusting kids that walk barefoot throughout the building), and the crowd relatively cliquish.
4	Allen Hall was the only thing I enjoyed about my Tenure at U of I.  The students were awesome to be around, artsy without being obscure, funny, and all-around good people.  Low Greek density, and right next to one of the only all-girls dorms?  Yeah.  I'm into it.
