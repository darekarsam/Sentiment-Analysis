3	My hubby being from Michoacan Mex. wanted to have authentic Michoacano food. When we arrived to the restaurant the location seemed a little sketchy. Surprisingly when we were inside we were a little relieved to find it a nice clean place. The waitress that greeted us was very inviting. They served salsa and refried beans and freshly made tortilla chips as an appetizer while you wait for your order. We asked for refills on the dips and chips because they were deelish!! The salsa was particularly my favorite so much that I ordered a container to go. I ordered the enchiladas with the carne cecina (its like beef jerky but more delicious) which I enjoyed every bite of. Hubby ordered the morisqueta (rice with pork meat in a chile sauce). And together we ordered a side of chicken tacos dorados (fried chicken tacos). We shared everything we ordered. I personally enjoyed the entire meal but my husband who really knows what food from Michoacan should taste like thought it was a little too bland for what he is used to & does not care to return to this place except for an order of cecina meat, the only thing he enjoyed. I, on the other hand often find my self craving the enchiladas and the free salsa & bean dips and chips.
