3	I have mixed feelings about this place. There may have been something to the fact that the last time we were here was on a very cold snowy night in the dead of winter, but it was literally dead. I've been here when it's packed on Friday at Happy Hour, because they do have some great specials. I hate when there's specials on drinks but not food. I need good deals, and these are some great deals! I also had my bachelorette party here. It was incredibly hard to get a hold of someone to plan the event. We finally did make set plans and when we got there the spread was incredible. It was only $30 per person with heavy appetizers, dessert and 2 complimentary drinks. Plus they have a very large private section for large parties, so it was nice to have our own little space. The one thing that's consistent is that the DJ is really good! So I would say stick to Happy Hours here and avoid the dead zone, aka winter months.
2	Bar Louie has a huge amount of space. There are some pool tables and dart board. Service is fine, drinks a little pricey, and the place doesn't get packed even on a Saturday night.It's not really my idea of fun.  It's an upscale club feeling for people who are too mature to go out to a real club.  The music and the clientele saw their best days a few years ago.On a nice day however, they have a big patio and a decent view of the city.
