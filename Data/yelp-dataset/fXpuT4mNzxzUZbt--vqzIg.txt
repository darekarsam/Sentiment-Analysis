2	This place has the worst help ever. Rude! Also, if you correct them when they are putting your vegetables on incorrectly, good luck! Only go here because it is close to my building.
2	They skimp out on a lot of ingredients here. Never enough meat, cheese, etc., but if you want lettuce or sauce, they'll give you tons of that. I've never had such a depressingly soggy footlong. I suggest you go to the Jimmy Johns a block away.
1	Pretty much the worst place to eat in UIUC. Bad customer service, terrible employees. Talk more than they work, doesn't seem to care about anyone who walks in.
