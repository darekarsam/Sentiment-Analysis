4	This shop really brings me back to my childhood, it's got a retro appearance, with bright toy box colours and the windows chock full of toys and games. They specialise in traditional toys here, you are unlikely to find really complex electronic gadgets, just good old fashioned fun. There are loads of board games, lego, child's dolls, for some reason Warhammer, and a few things I had never seen before. It is a bit of a shambles as well, but in a cute independent shop way, you can get lost in amongst piles of toys and games.The people there are great as well and you can see that they enjoy selling toys to little kids, and bigger kids as well. I did see a few adults having a cheeky peek around and it was amusing realising that they were enjoying it more than the kids. Since the closure of Woolworths there are few toy stores around any more, and even fewer independent toy shops. Toys Galore is there to bring fun to people and in that respect it succeeds. A great place for gifts, either for children or for those who still claim to be 'young at heart'
