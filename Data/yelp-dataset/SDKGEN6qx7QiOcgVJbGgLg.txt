5	Doug is great !  he has a very complete bike shop with an amazing line of new bikes.  You want an organic bamboo bicycle.. he's got it.  you want a high end, state of the art mountain bike or touring bike, he's got it.. you want a cruiser for yourself ,, you guessed it,, he's got it.. even great bikes for the kids in all sizes and colors.  They have a fantastic repair service as well with very reasonable rates.  Doug really knows his stuff.  He is an avid rider himself and has been in the business for years.   It is worth the drive to head out to Fountain Hills Bikes.  He is at the north end of Fountain Hills so if you are looking for a great place to meet friends before a nice ride, this is the place.  Easy to find and real easy going guys.
5	Great service, selection and brands
