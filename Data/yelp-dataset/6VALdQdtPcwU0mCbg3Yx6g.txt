3	Sushi in Montreal is expensive (but where is it not when I'm still comparing it to west coast prices!?) and despite being a rather unimpressively decored little mint green box (blaring Mandarin pop), Ichi Sushi is no exception. Thankfully though, if the craving hits and you've got somewhere nice to go al fresco, the sushi here is pretty good. Beside a large number of regular and chef special makis and the to-be-expected a la carte nigiri and sashimi options, Ichi also has refreshing tartares and rice paper rolls. The menu layout of makis by size (small, medium, and large), is also different and caters to diners with varying appetite sizes and preferences for variety.

5	Love the sushi here. Hidden gem at the corner of mont royal and saint Laurent. Great place for a quick bite or take out. Walking distance to the mountain where you can sit and enjoy quality sushi. I've been going quite often to this place and always a pleasure. Service is friendly and the portions are fair. It's definitely a mouth full! Amazing selection and great flavors. My favorite are the rolls with sweet potatoes and Fuji apples. If you don't eat real crab they are more then happy to replace it. Just ask! The fish is always fresh and never got sick. I would highly recommend this place and if you do go often they have a sushi card to help save a few dollars. Already for what you get the price is fair and worth it.
