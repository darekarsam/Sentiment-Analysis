5	Great place to work - a company that cares about its people. While most work is fast paced, they are challenges worth looking forward to every day.
4	Since I'm on the home services and utilities kick, it's only fair to review Duke Energy! My comments are pretty straightforward, similar to the Duke bill I receive every month. I've only had to call customer service on one occasion and they were pretty quick to remedy my issue and address any other questions I had. They also send out a box of free CFL lightbulbs to ensure your home is more energy efficient. NICE! I also appreciate their social media involvement - they keep those Twitter feeds full of pertinent utility related information when a dangerous weather is a-brewing!
4	We have to have electricity & you have no choice but to use Duke. :DLuckily, I've never had any major power outages, even when nasty storms rage during the spring & summer months.  And I can depend pretty much on my bill to go up during the months of December - February & again from June - August.They're pretty much "in the news" when there's going to be a rate increase, so you're never fully caught off guard.I love having the "paperless" bill option. It's full of detailed information about my bills & ways to possibly cut down. However in my case, they always say I am way below the normal usage & the weather normally affects the changes. Like Nicole, I appreciate them sending out the free CFL bulbs.
1	In my opinion, Duke is destroying the environment in North Carolina as well as other states it operates in. The Dan River will never be the same and due to owning several politicians, they only cleaned up a fraction of the coal ash they spilled into the River.
