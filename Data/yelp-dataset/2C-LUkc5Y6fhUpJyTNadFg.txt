4	A buddy of mine suggested we go here.... Thanks, Paul!This is a tiny, bright yellow, dump of a building in a sketchy neighborhood and the menu is pretty narrowly focused on chicken.... but oh, man is the food good! The chicken is grilled over an open flame, you peel the meat off the bone yourself, roll it into a tortilla and cover it with the awesome sauce that they keep in squeeze bottles.... It's actually what people refer to when the say "Awesome Sauce".... I'm sure of it.
2	This place ok but clearly We need to come back when its busier cause the chicken was very dry, like its been siting for a while. The flavor was nice but the chicken killed it. Maybe if I got a full chicken it would be better but that was just too much chicken for one person. I got the 1/4 portion which is enough for 1 person and they give, rice, beans, tortillas, lettuce, tomatoes, pickled onions and hot sauce. When you put everything together it tasted alright but it was just dry chicken.
