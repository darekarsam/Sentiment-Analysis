5	The lil things was a dream come true! Lara is such a joy to work with. We brainstormed and she created the coolest decor items for our game of thrones themed party. Our guests couldn't stop talking about them. She also helped create some items for my wedding as well. I will definitely be contacting them again for future events! It's all about the little details :)
5	The Lil Things made two things for my wedding. Lara (owner) made me both a cake topper and a hairpiece. Both were made completely by hand and turned out so beautifully! They were EXACTLY what I wanted, and Lara made sure to incorporate special attention to both projects. She even texted me photos as she was purchasing supplies, to make sure that we were on the same page. Everything turned out so great!
5	LOVE the invitations, favors and decorations Lara made for my baby shower.  They were absolutely adorable!!!!  It made the celebration even more memorable.  Thank you so much Lara for making me smile from ear to ear.
