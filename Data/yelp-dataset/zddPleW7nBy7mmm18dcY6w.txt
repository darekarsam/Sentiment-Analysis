5	I needed a specialty cake for my son and my normal baker was not available, so the search was on for someone creative enough to make the design and color scheme without compromising the taste of the cake.  I am very particular about my cakes as I am a perfectionist when it comes to taste...it's crazy to have a great looking cake that taste like crap(one of my pet peeves)....so after pretty much interrogating my friend that referred me to 'The Art of Baking', I was assured I would be pleased but that wasn't enough for me I needed a sample........a taste....something, so I was able to taste one of their cupcakes at a function and was a little relieved as it tasted pretty darn good so I was cautiously optimistic.  My son had specifically requested a Robin cake, not Batman, not Batman and Robin.......Robin!  I had never seen a Robin cake before but I was going to honor his request.I was so excited when I received the cake as it was exactly as I requested and to see the look on my son's face was priceless!  The taste was simply amazing and everyone loved the cake so much that I had to grab the last few slices before it disappeared.  I recently attended an event where I was able to enjoy their cupcake cake in the flavors of key lime and red velvet and it was just too good for words.  I'm so glad to have found a new baker:-)
5	They have taken care of me with their amazing desserts!!!! I was recommended to them by a co worker & was greatly appreciative for the referral & the desserts I received.
5	They were at food truck Friday in south end and we had to get 6 cupcakes because we couldn't decide.  They were amazing so moist and delicious! We got The KIng, red velvet, cookies and cream, salted caramel in both chocolate and vanilla, and pancakes and bacon.  All amazing!  Hope to see their food truck again.
