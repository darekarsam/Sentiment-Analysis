5	Clay arts Vegas carries Laguna clay I use Laguna B Mix with grog and they had 1000 pounds in stock. There is a big gallery and a teaching area with 11 wheels and huge handbuilding  area out back there is a kiln yard with all different kilns including raku kilns. They fire raku every second Saturday.
4	This review is for the gallery section of CAV. The gallery is small but has a lot of interesting work.  Work ranges in size from cups/mugs all the way to really large vases. The makers of the ceramics are around to chat as well. Definitely worth a look.
5	My first day in class at Clay arts and I am impressed.  They have a lot of interesting art work along with a very nice array of supplies for the clay artist.  There are many wheels.  The owners are extremely helpful and make you feel at home.  Our instructor K.D. Matheson was superb!  He has patience and also a good sense of humor.  I highly recommend this place for the beginning artist to the professional artist.  Great for small kids too when they have kids art going on.
