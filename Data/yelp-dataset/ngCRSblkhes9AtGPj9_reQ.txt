3	Decent and reasonable family style restaurant.  Lunch fare offered subs, sandwiches, burgers, and entree's, along with a special lunch menu that for $5.95 comes with french fries and coffee or tea.  Good selection of food, cheap prices, and fair service.  Nothing fancy, but it's not presented that way either.  I had the freedom sub, which was turkey, bacon, and roast beef with french fries.  Free refills on soda too - actually have run into two places recently that don't, so I figured I'd mention it.
5	I'm a little hooked in this place. It's great because it's fast and cheap. Plus everyone that works there are so nice. I eat here for work lunch, and even on a time crunch but don't want fast food, this is the place.
4	This place is alright!The food was good.My sandwich was tasty.The service was very friendly and I left with a smile.
4	Really yummy food here. I prefer their breakfast over their lunch/dinner food tho. I'm from Shelby so you know I'm a fan of livermush and was able to get some here. The food always arrives quick and the waitresses are really nice. I'll agree with someone else who said the decor leaves a lot to be desired but the food is good and cheap and as long as I don't see a rat or roach then I'm good.
