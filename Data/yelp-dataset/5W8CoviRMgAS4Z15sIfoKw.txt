3	Now that we live in Mint Hill, it seems only appropriate to add a few Mint Hill entries.  That, and the fact that Crazy Hazy reminded me that I hit the auspicious mark of 666 reviews, I need something wholesome to offset her evilness.  So here it is - the Mint Hill Farmers Market.In short: I wish it was better.What is there isn't bad.  It's just that there isn't much.  If you have been to the state market, you'll know that even the Charlotte Regional hardly holds a candle, and the Matthews market is small in comparison to that one.  But the Mint Hill Market is like a couple of people throwing out tables during a yard sale.I'm all for the local food movement, and would love to see it blossom.  I just don't know if this will help much.  It's hidden behind the Historical Society building, so it's difficult to see.  And there isn't a lot there.  What we have had is good, though.  Since they are already closed for the season, I only hope they come back stronger next year, because the Charlotte Regional Market is a much longer drive now that we're all the way in Mint Hill.
5	Mint Hill Market is starting May 3rd this year. A lot of new great vendors. Bakers, produce, seamstress,  local honey,  and more. Can't wait to get my hands on all these fresh item's.
