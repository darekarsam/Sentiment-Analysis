1	Worst customer service in pharmacy. 5 people working and takes forever to be acknowledged. Then they argue with you over your coverage. I'd just go to Walgreens if my rx coverage would let me. You should too if you want to actually be helped.
3	This store is a decent store, although the day I went in there, I was in search of cold medicine and their pharmacy was not open. They did not have the type of product I was in need of, so I left and went up the road to Walgreen's.
5	Faye the cashier is one of the most uplifting people in retail I've ever come across. Seriously every time I'm in there she is so sweet! I work retail as well so I know how daunting it can be but this girl is so full of life! Anyway good job CVS for having an awesome employee!
4	I don't usually shop at CVS because I find that the prices are higher than most drugstore retailers. I dropped in recently because they had a special sale. I was very pleased with the store's customer service. The employees are helpful and friendly.  Several employees offered help and asked me if there was anything they could help me find while I was shopping. The store was clean, well organized and very shopable. I did not visit the pharmacy, this review is based only on my store experience. I will be returning to shop here in the future.
