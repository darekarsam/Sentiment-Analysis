5	Robert is very knowledgable and timely when it comes to his work. He doesn't beat around the bush and tells you exactly what needs to be done and at an affordable cost! My 99 Mustang's transmission solenoids are burnt out and are in need to be replaced. Robert quoted me at $350 for parts and labor which is a very reasonable price! I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking for work to be done.
5	Robert helped me out with a burnt out headlight at midnight. I was SOL and he really helped me out way outside business hours. Will use his services again!
5	Professional man who clearly has a solid knowledge about car mechanics. Robert is very resourceful, also he is fully equipped with best tools needed to resolve your car issues.I highly recommend this business to help you fix your vehicle !!!
