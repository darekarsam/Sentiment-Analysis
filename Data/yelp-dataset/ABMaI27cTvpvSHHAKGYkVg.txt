5	This place is fabulous! I recently walked in and had a great time fulfilling all my paper needs! I decided to have a card making party with some of my friends and they even kept the place open after hours (pretty sure it was a special case). The people here are so friendly and wonderful. I will be back over and over.
4	Perfect shop for unique, witty, and humorous cards, gorgeous stationery, beautiful paper goods, and various novelties and gifts. I appreciate the staff are always helpful and courteous. Parking can be a pain, but once you score a spot, you will be delighted to explore all the goodies in the store.
3	Fun Store with great stuff you will not see other places! Great place to go for cards and playful things.Not sure why, but I find the staff at the Tivoli Sq. a bit friendlier. Because of that the Tivoli location is my preference.Although happy to shop in either.
