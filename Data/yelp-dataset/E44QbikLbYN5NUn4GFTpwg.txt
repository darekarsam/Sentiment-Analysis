5	I worked with Jim Flynn based on my Realtor's recommendation. He was very knowledgeable and friendly. He answered questions quickly and he truly did do everything in his power to make sure that I got the home I wanted with a loan I could afford. I would recommend him if you need a home loan. The other staff at Starboard were great and friendly as well. Everyone responds quickly and they are pretty straight forward on what you need.
5	My wife and I purchased our first home and I have nothing but great things to say about Starboard. Our lender Jim Flynn was awesome! He walked us through every step and made all of the confusing details easy for us to understand. Thanks so much!
1	What a nightmare! If you don't fit into the perfect mold--forget about it. I spent more than two and a half months trying to get a simple refinance done. They charged me for an appraisal (that was a joke) and other fees and then couldn't get the loan done--it was a complete waste of time and money. My broker was very nice, but I'm sure he had his hands tied. I would NOT recommend this company.
