4	*UPDATED 04/21/14*I give only 2 stars because this location is not equipped to handle electronic coupons. We went with an e-coupon and were turned away.Update 04/21/14 ~ I've upped the rating by 2 stars because @AuntieAnnes responded promptly to a tweet and I received a coupon in the mail already.
