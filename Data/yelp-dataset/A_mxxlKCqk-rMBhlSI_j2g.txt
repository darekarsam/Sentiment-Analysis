1	Very poor condition . They need to spend some money on this v ourse. Greens are not good at all. Too bad it could be a great course.
1	Mediocre course and the worst customer service I've ever seen at a golf course. One guy told us to our face that that was the slowest he's ever seen the last hole played then proceeded to tell us if we don't keep up with the people in front of us they will kick us off the course. Oh yeah this a Tuesday at noon so it's not packed. Worst course I've ever been....
1	Worst golf course I've ever golfed at. Horrible customer service. Not military friendly. Burnt hot dogs and 1 bathroom on the course. Holes pulled out on the greens. Will never golf here again.
