5	I have been patronizing this jeweler since I moved here in 2005.  I mostly go there for repairs and a little Pandora.  They are currently working on a ring given to me by my mother, who passed away several years ago.  I have always been pleased.
5	Beautiful jewelry affordable great service & super helpful. Wish they financed though. Def will recommend to everyone:)
4	This is the retail arm of a diamond wholesaler. I do not understand some of the reviews here. The metal jewelry in my experience is just okay to sub-par. Nevertheless, the diamonds are well priced. They do not have many GIA certifications, but when you buy an EGL you just factor that in. I am mystified as to why that is so difficult to understand. The stones are well under many, if not all, of the others' prices on the row. You should do your research wherever you buy, however.
