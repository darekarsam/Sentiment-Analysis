4	Ice cream like I remember as a kid. The ice cream tube brings back memories. And it is right next door to Ned's Krazy Sub, so it makes a perfect ending to a perfect sandwich.
1	DO NOT come to this location. Employee "Hayden" thinks its a laughing matter to serve kids expired food and condiments! We're so upset at the service and unprofessionalism that we yelped it and contacted the Health Department immediately after returning home. Among a MULTIPLE of horrible experiences within 10 minutes, the straw that broke the camels back was when the worker jokingly pulls out an unlabeled white Styrofoam container full of condiment and jokes with  his co-workers right in front of us "Dude, its been expired since June" and chuckles. I demanded my money back and questioned the kid "YOU GAVE MY 5 YEAR OLD EXPIRED TOPPINGS LAST WEEK AND YOU THINK ITS FUNNY". We walked out and alerted the Gymnastics gym next door and all the parents about the situation. Oh and to top it off, "Hayden" and his horrible sarcastic attitude thanked me personally for cleaning the table we sat at just as i left the store.
5	First time I visited, there's was a friendly older man working there. He was helpful and let me know about the punch card. You pay $10 and get 50 gallons. Not too bad! It's a dated location but clean and the ice cream variety is good.
