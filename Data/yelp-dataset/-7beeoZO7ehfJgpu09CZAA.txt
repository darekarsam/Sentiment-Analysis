3	One of the best places to buy camis for a cheap price and they always have tons of colors in stock. I'm not really a fan of much else. Every now and again, there will be a cute shirt. The location isn't great either... it's in a very busy shopping plaza but it's in the back corner so you don't ever know it's there unless you do a drive-by.
3	Good deals on staple items. Covers all bases - jewelry, shoes, bags & accessories. Girl working was super helpful with explaining how everything works. A lot of buy 1 get 1 50% off. Will have to check them out more often :))
