2	Let's see...- Insultingly Hard Selling of "Yearly Pet Care Program" upon entry.- Mediocre Examinations performed by unhappy workers.- Constant Cross Selling of Services by Receptionist as if they are working on commission only.- As Much as I love the concept of the convenience of it being right next to Petsmart, I love my dog and I will need to pass on this one.-Pet Care is NOT their priority....
3	I love that the staff always loves on my pets, but sometimes I want to leave after I pay, not have my dog passed around to people I don't know while I'm standing idly by. At least I know they get love when they're there for the whole day.
5	Very loving pet care hospital one of the best I have ever been blessed to visit.
