2	Well this Walgreen's has all the stuff it needs for a Pharmacy quick grab but I find that the employees at this location just don't care.  Did you see that period over there, yeah this is just a job that they are here to get the pay check and that is it.  I am not impressed and look forward to Walgreen's recovery at another location.  I do want to mention that the Pharmacy is very interactive and commutative and is a 360 from what the retail side of this store is.  Highly Recommend the Pharmacy
4	Conveniently located pretty close to Banner Del Web. Right on the 60 / Grand Ave. off of Bell Rd. In Surprise. Parking is easy and staff are friendly.Located close to Trader Joe's and some other stores like Walmart.I like shopping here because it's usually not too busy.
