5	Dr. Hoecker is a caring and professional doctor. His nurse also made a lasting first impression. This facility is extremely professional and clean.
4	The times I've been,  there has always been very little wait time.  I'm giving the low rating, because they tend to be tight on prescribing antibiotics.
1	Very poor customer service. Incredibly long wait times. Avoid Scottsdale Healthcare.
4	Dr. Abby Roberts has been my physician for almost 5 years.  She has always shown the qualities I want in a doctor.  She actually listens and takes the time to understand my issues.The office staff has always been helpful and I have rarely ever had to wait for an appointment.  Their followup after test results have been promptly communicated.The covered parking next door is certainly an added bonus in the summer.
1	While Dr. Olson-Gibbs is an amazing physician, I am now looking elsewhere for healthcare.When this clinic was Towne Center Medical Group, you could call and make an appointment in less than five minutes. Minimal time on hold.I am trying to make an appointment now and am listening to the recording telling me how important my call is - for 16 minutes so far.  This is the new normal under Scottsdale Healthcare.If my call or business was important to them, they would have answered already.
