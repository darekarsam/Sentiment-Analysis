5	From newborns to families to weddings, there is a story to be told.
5	Adena is the consummate professional.  She photographed my niece and put she and my aunt at ease from beginning to end - so important in photography.  They loved the experience and were thrilled with their photos.
5	Adena is an amazing photographer! She makes you feel so relaxed and does a great job! It doesn't hurt that she is used to taking pictures of family and friends all the time! She took my graduation photos from college and they turned out really great! I would trust her with all my important milestones in life! She is a wonderful individual whom I am truly blessed to know!
