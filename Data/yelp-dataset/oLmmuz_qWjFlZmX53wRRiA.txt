4	Remodel is coming together. The new pharmacy managers are very helpful and knowledgeable. This location has a full service chase bank branch also. Not to bad for a smaller version of the Fry's store.   There is a fuel points redeemable gas station out front which is very helpful.   Can't wait to see the final remodel.
1	Both my children have applied for jobs at our Frys store and the managers don't seem to give a rats butt it's perfect for my children we live wAlking distance and daughter I'd in a job that is not working out my son it seems like they completely blew him off  They need hard workers and why do they not hire people that want the jobs at our shooing store.  Seems like managers are Always on Vacation ?? Im about ready to shop at bashas or walmart very soon they need to get it together
3	This a below par FRY'S considering they just spent a lot of money remodeling the outside. The inside is very crammed. The one on 27th ave and bell is bigger and not so crammed.
