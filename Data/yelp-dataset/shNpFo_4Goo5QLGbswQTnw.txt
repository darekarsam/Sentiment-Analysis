3	Love that this location has a drive through! The employees there are hit & miss in the friendly department.  Same goes for my beverage /  food order.  I've honestly never gone inside; just always used the drive through.  Beware...this place stays pretty busy, therefore, you may have to wait in line for a while.  They share a parking lot with a couple other businesses, so parking is an issue.  They do have patio / outdoor seating, which is a plus.
5	This is what a Starbucks should be. At 6:20 AM, I was in and out very quickly. The gal who asked "What can I get started for you?" was friendly, my coffee was perfect, it only took a few moments and even better, my coffee was free thanks to my birthday reward.This was a very good experience!
2	The quality of coffee you would expect from a Starbucks at about 4 times the wait, if not more. Made the mistake of stopping for a much needed pumpkin spice latte and left 15-17 minutes later with what other Starbucks pump out in about 2. Maybe I'm spoiled by the service of others but man, I was caught off guard by how slow the service was. Happy sippin'. Just don't go if you have the slightest issue with patience!  On a brighter note...the pumpkin spice latte was decent.
1	I have been waiting 10 minutes for 2 caramel macchiatos. There are starbuck employees standing around while there are many drinks waiting to be made. And I am pretty sure there are drinks being made before mine! It's ok, it another reason why I will start going to mom and pa coffee shops!
