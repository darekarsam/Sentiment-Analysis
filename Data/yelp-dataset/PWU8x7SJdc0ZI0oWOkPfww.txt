5	I've taken my car here several times and have never been anything but pleased. The workers are courteous, and any work I've ever needed on my car has always been done very quickly. The prices are fair; I've never felt that I'm being scammed over because I'm a woman. I've made the mistake of going other places in the area, but no more--the people at Broadway are honest, friendly, and efficient. I won't take my car anywhere else from now on.
5	Broad way is the only place I take my car on the East End. Customer service is through the roof, and I never have any doubt that they do things right and efficiently. They will let me know if something might need fixed in the near future, but have never put pressure on me to pay for more than is immediately necessary. They are good at explaining what is wrong, and don't use the scare tactic that other garages use (using big words and jargon to confuse you into buying more service).  I trust these guys!
5	I've taken my car to various garages in Pittsburgh throughout the year.  Most of the one's that have 5 stars generally fell short of my expectation except for Broadway Auto.  This garage is by far the most honest, friendly, affordable, fast and trustworthy.  Historically I would end up taking it to Pep Boys because they were cheapest.  I initially went to Bway to cross confirm whether my rear brakes needed to be changed as per Pep Boys.  Bway said everything was fine front and rear and just charged me for inspection.  I felt that showed integrity as plenty of other garages could have changed it out and made money on my lack of knowledge.  It's nice to support a local business that deserves it.
