5	Awesome service. Troy will take care of you and make sure he gets you into a quality used vehicle.  Unlike other local used car dealers, trend stands behind their cars.  They also offer in house financing and deal with you fairly and honestly.
5	Troy, is a honest car guy, surprised, well you will be you can count on him to do the right thing. You will love his cars and him, don't hesitate to go and check it out.
1	Beware. Troy sold us a bad car and refuses to take it back or do anything about it. He kept the vehicle for over a month saying it was being repaired and the car has the same problem! Of course we had to pay the payment on the car while it sat in the shop. Our mechanic says it needs a new transmission and Troy said he checked it out and its fine.
4	Even though I was unable to acquire a car within my budget, I want to give Troy a ton of credit for being honest with me, unlike many car salesmen, who are just out for the commission.I will keep an eye on cars from this company in the future.
