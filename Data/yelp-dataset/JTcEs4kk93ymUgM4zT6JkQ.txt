1	Had someone from monsoon come look at my roof to give an estimate. The guy left and I never heard from anyone for a couple of weeks. I called back and they were clueless. Sent someone else out and completely started over from scratch. Very frustrating. Going with someone else.
5	Mark T., MesaMy roof came out better than the new construction. Monsoon included 80lb paper, flashing and birdstop. They sprayed the flashing instead of brushing and finished the job in 4 1/2 days. Melvin answered all my questions and emails promptly. Highly recommend.Great Job!
5	Very professional, the estimator that came out was cleanly dressed and very polite.  He explained everything in detail about the condition of the roof, gave me a great estimate that seemed fair and explained everything about it.I couldn't have asked for anything more, top notch job.
5	I should have written this right after we had our roof done.  Melvin, the owner, came out and estimated the job and gave us lots of great information. He has a lot of experience int he industry and it showed.  He took lots of pictures up on the roof of where our problem spots were so we could see what he was concerned about. WHen it came time to do the job, his people showed up on time, worked threir butts off, and cleaned everything up. He advised us that we could reuse all but a couple broken tiles and they did a complete new underlayment with up to date materials. I highly recommend Melvin and Monsoon Roofing.  It was a great experience.
4	Very good job on estimate and time to completion. Roofers did a good job and cleaned up after themselves every day. It looks amazing and added to the sale price of our home. I just wish we had a longer warranty (2 years) or that a longer warranty time was discussed with us during the bid process.
