5	Get here early because this place is popular.  The lemongrass soup (aka sweet and sour soup) is probably the best I've ever had (and I've had it in NYC, Boston, SF and DC).  All the appetizers are delicious.  I'd recommend the Thai food over the Filipino food (b/c the Thai food is top quality), but, don't get me wrong, the Filipino food is good. The Filipino Beef Caldereta is amazing.  Overall, the thai green curry is the best dish in the place. Service was prompt despite how busy the restaurant was.  Great, great restaurant.
5	BYOB!!!  The will charge $1 per glass and considering there is no corkage fee, it's quite the bargain.  The outdoor side patio here is overflowing with plant and flowers and super green and peaceful.The food is amazing.  I love the curry dishes.  Last night I tried the shrimp pineapple fried rice and it was heavenly.  Started our dinner with the pork dumplings and they are amazing served with a nice dipping sauce.  The dumplings come 4 to an order which I thought was a good amount but my bf was hungry for 1 more dumpling.  It's just a great place.  It's also a pretty place with some amazing food.
4	Asian food in Pitts! so, this used to be in the boonies, so we were all very happy when it moved closer. If you want to eat filipino food, this is the place! it was quite good, although i've only had filipino food a couple times so i'm not sure i have the best comparison. i definitely enjoyed it though. They also have thai food here, and like others have said - BYOB. advice? go with others and share!
5	Great date spot.  Outdoor seating is breathtaking.  The appetizers are to die for, especially the spring rolls.  Everything is so fresh and delicious.  BYOB only $1 per glass, which is cheap! I've never had a bad experience at this place.  The waitstaff was beyong courteous.  I recommend making reservations.  They tend to get very very busy!  Plus it's only a couple blocks from me.  And the name has been changed to Pusadee's Kitchen.
