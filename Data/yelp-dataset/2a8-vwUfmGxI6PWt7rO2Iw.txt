2	I don't know if this lady is just really busy or if she is just about the the money, but I sent her a message via Facebook. (she updates nearly every day) To see if she had any openings for a two year old, it literally took her a month to respond. (you can tell when someone has read a Message on Facebook) I don't think that was business like at all and very rude. At least respond with I'm currently full at the moment. Because of this I wouldn't recommend.
5	I am a single mom of a 3 year old little boy. I'm incredibly picky about who watches him. I'm the hippie type mom, we eat organic, we're both vegetarian, I don't have cable TV, and we do Yoga together :D Chanel is great with all of my quirks! My son has learned so much being in her care twice a week, I have even trusted her with weekends on a couple of occasions. She has worked with me when I struggle, and welcomes my little boy into her home like her own child. He loves her daughter and I am forever grateful for her.Reasonable rates, flexible hours, and health conscious. Would definitely recommend!
