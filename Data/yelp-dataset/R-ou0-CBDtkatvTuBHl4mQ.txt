5	My husband and I visited the store while in Vegas celebratinging our ten year wedding annivesary.. We were just looking but ended up leaving with a fantastic ring. Cher and the creww were great. they took the stone from my ring and placed it in a new setting. It is Breathtaking.
5	great store!!!!!!!! Stuart Berger is the greatest!
3	I like high end watches and this store has some.  Unfortunately, none of the brands that I'm looking for.  But this store was the first one to introduce me to Ball watches.  Cool factor up high on this since they have gas luminescence built in the dials, a unique feature that I don't know exist with any mechanical watches today.  Maybe one day, I will buy one.
5	I needed to get a vintage ring sized that I had purchased elsewhere while I was in Vegas. You wouldn't believe how hard it is to find a place on the strip that does this! I stopped in at Fashion Show Mall after a shop at the Wynn and the Concierge recommended trying there. The staff was super friendly and sized the ring with zero problems. They even spiffed it up with new plating and cleaning- all done within a couple of hours. Pick up was easy and quick. Simple job but no complaints and done quick. Good by me!
1	My Tissot watch was out of battery and i happened to be there shopping with my wife thinking they carry Tissots so decided to have battery changed there.   He said titanium watch cost 20 dollars and took 15 minutes.  I thought it was a little expensive but since I was there so I went ahead and had it changed.Later, i went to pick up my watch and turned it over, the back case was not closed all the way which was not a big deal, but there was a dent on the edge where he used the tool to open the back case.  i asked my watch collector friend and he said he might used the wrong tool or very careless and inexperience.  After all, the watch cost about $450.
