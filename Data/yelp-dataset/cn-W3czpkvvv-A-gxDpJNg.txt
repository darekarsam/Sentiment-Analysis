5	We had a great time!!!
5	Attended a Wine and Design painting session today at Piggly's BBQ and Grill. I am not an artist or painter and was nervous. Ended up having a blast and really like the way my painting turned out. Going again this Tuesday, looking forward to another great time!  If you're looking for a fun time, I would definitely suggest checking out Wine and Design!
5	Had a great time painting this evening!  The ladies were very friendly and helpful! Casual atmosphere and fun subject to paint.  The only thing I could suggest is a bit more direction would be helpful. Sometimes it was unclear what I was doing next. For a fun time, call Wine and Design!
5	I would like to say that I don't have much artistic ability, but this place allows you to unleash your inner artistic self and create a masterpiece in a fun and nurturing environment.  I spent my Friday evening here with a group for a two hour session with an ultimate goal of producing a piece of art.  When I was told about this set up, I was at first daunted, but the instruction by Lisa easily put my fears at ease.  If you are with a group of friends, you are bound to have a lot of fun as the establishment combines some wine with paint and art and instruction to generate a fun experience.  Lisa broke down the assignment into simple steps that needed minimal handholding.  Even though you are guided to use specific colors and are taught the approach to mix the colors to produce the desire shade, there is still enough wiggle room to give you an artistic license.When the session was up, I couldn't believe that I put together my work of art, in such a limited amount of time.  I can't wait to do this again!
5	Super fun! Great host! Lots to drink... And lovely environment. Great for parties. Will definitely be back!
