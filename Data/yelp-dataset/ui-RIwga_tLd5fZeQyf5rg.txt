3	Good Italian deli for a quick cheap lunch. Nothing amazing but decent.
5	Cavallaro is an excellent Italian delicatessen with quite a selection of freshly prepared dishes. Every time I set foot in this establishment I am required to peruse the treasure trove of goodness before my eyes. The pizza, oh Lord Jesus Christ, the pizza. Get a half slice of the veggie pizza sans cheese. Get it heated up and have them pour a generous heaping of their fresh Parmigiano-Reggiano on top. If your feeling like some heat get a side of their "bomba" pepper sauce! That was just the appetiser by the way. After the awesome pizza you'll order the eggplant parm with a good portion of their perfectly cooked rapini. This eggplant parm is the best way to eat eggplant you'll ever encounter. It almost serves as a delivery mechanism for cheese and tomato sauce. Rapini is a beautiful green cruciferous vegetable similar to broccoli. Eat your greens! Have a mushroom rice ball or some cannelloni. They've also got the best coffee on this stretch of Sherbrooke Street West. Have a cafe latte after your meal with a nice biscotti. Also, what gift do you give to the person that has everything? The answer: a one thousand dollar bottle of balsamic vinegar from more than a century ago. They've got that here and they've also got black truffles and real panforte and panettone or Italian Christmas fruit cake. They've got close to a bazillion bottles of different olive oils and vinegars, tonnes of cheeses and excellent Italian torrefaction coffee and espresso. Come here for all things Italian and apparently Challah bread as well. Mangia, si dovrebbe mangiare, sei pelle e ossa. Buon appetito!
