5	Love love LOVE that there is a location close to me now!! I dropped my pups off for  grooming on Saturday, even though the traffic can be crazy around the strip, it didn't hold me up. I had an 11am appointment and was there a bit early, an hr and 15 min later or so i got a call that they were ready. They both looked awesome and smelled so so good! Only one of my dogs received a hair cut and looked amazing, they made her look like a real dog instead of a stray dog again (her hair gets out of control) the girls were so awesome there and i am very excited to be going back every 3-4 weeks
4	Friendly staff,  quick groom and competitive prices.  My only complaint, and the reason for the 4 stars was my dog smelled horrible after her grooming. Normally my dog smells great after grooming, that was so not the case. The one on banksville is much closer to my house, and will be using that one next time. I hope for the same cut, but better smell :)
5	the staff at The Dog Stop are really knowledgeable and care for my dogs like they were their own dogs. My dogs are always happy and well cared for at The Dog Stop. Highly recommended!
5	I have been taking my dog to the Dog Stop in the Strip District for over a month now after purchasing a package for day care. I have to say, I have been extremely pleased with my experience. Gary, Chelsey, Kim, Amanda and the rest of the staff have taken such great care of my pup, they are always very pleasant and show so much love and care to my dog. We are fans of the Dog Stop Strip District!
