5	My office is right across the street, so I eat here at least once a month.The employees are always nice, the place is clean and always busy.
5	This location is just down the street from where I work, so it's perfect for me to get in and out of in a jiffy.Very friendly crew here. They work hard and fast to get customers their food in a timely manner. My food was so delicious and fresh! I know I will definitely be back there for lunch and since they also serve breakfast, I will try that as well.
1	I went to this subway today for lunch and the subway employee was very rude. I ordered a chicken sub. She asked me of I wanted the sandwich with the just the chicken. "Just the chicken?", I said, "no I want it with the whole meal". She stops and the an older lady comes out and ask me if I wanted it toasted. I say oh yes I do. The. The older lady says something in Spanish to the younger and she laughs. I know it was towards me. So I just leave. These chicks are rude. Bad customer service!
