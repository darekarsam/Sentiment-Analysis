4	No one enjoys going to get their health card, get tested for diseases, or waiting for all of this to commence. Once I came back from abroad I had to come in to obtain a health card for work. I was in and out in relatively no time. I remembered the hassle of going to the Shadow Lane branch and this was way better. Recently, I had to take my sister here to get some tests done and get her ready for school. Although the TB test is a pain in the rear, we were able to get it all done within 15 minutes of entering the building. I am still amazed with the speediness of everything.
1	What a crappy place, surrounded by crappy people to have to get a health card. CLOSED for lunch as we arrived... Are you kidding me? What a racket for unnecessary government fees....
