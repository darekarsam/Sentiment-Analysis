1	I just moved to this area and I was looking for a nail salon and I got a coupon for $3 off a pedicure and I thought ok, I will give it a try.  It was awful... the guy was not even interested in doing my pedicure, and even made a face at me.  Will not being going back, ever.
4	My little sister and I went to get our nails done on Saturday and we had a very nice experience at Super 7 Nails. Tina did my gels manicure as well as my pedicure. I did the Euro Pedi and I wanted the extras. It was worth it. I liked also how they use a liner for each pedicure so that you know your feet is going into CLEAN water. They throw away the plastic liner once your pedicure is over. I do recommend this place as everyone was friendly and the prices are fair. For a gel manicure just across the street it was 42 bucks, here it's only 25, or in the area. They have been at this location for less than a year. Try it!
5	I had a coupon to use so decided to give myself a treat for a manicure and pedicure.I found this establishement to be clean, friendly, efficient use of time, and competent.Why I say this is I went across the street to Ancala Nails, to use another coupon I had, and I found just the opposite.  I'm sold on Super 7 Nails.  I will be back, with or without a coupon.
4	The salon is very clean and the staff is always a pleasure. I love their pedicures. They use new linings in each foot bath and the basic pedicure comes with a hot stone leg massage.
5	I love this place.  It's clean and the pedicure chairs are nice.  They use liners in the pedicure bowls for every pedicure which makes me feel better about those bowls being clean.  I have brought friends who were also impressed.  Kim is great, and she gets it right with my nails every time.  Highly recommended.
5	Great place! Best in the area. Outstanding owner and team members. Highly recommend any of the clinicians. Very clean
