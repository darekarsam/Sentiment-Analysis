4	Good pizza considering the price. Fast and friendly service.
2	I had higher hopes of being true mexican pizza like i got growing up.  I will say it was very cheap!!  I also love their marketing.
3	The service stammered me. My roommate felt it tasted like rubber. Well the 5 dollars for the large pizza was just the right price.
5	Good pizza
1	This pizza is really good for its price. However this location is dirty. My boyfriend and I walked in and was looking at the menu hanging on the wall and there it was, this huge roach dead hanging there... ON THE MENU. At least clean it up so the customers don't see it. Disgusting. Now I know why the pizza was so good.
