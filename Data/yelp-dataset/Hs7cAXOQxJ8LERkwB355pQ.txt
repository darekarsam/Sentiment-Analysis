5	I love 1 Nevada Credit Union easy convenient always here for me
1	Horrible experience with them.  Tried to get an auto loan through them and they wouldn't cooperate and work with us and the dealer to get the documentation that was needed to achieve the loan.  Patrick never returned anyones calls and we got attitude from a few different reps that we spoke to on the phone.  We took our business and outstanding credit elsewhere where our business was appreciated.  As a bonus, we even got a better interest rate as well.  Never doing business with them again
