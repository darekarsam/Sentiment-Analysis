5	I have been going to golfstretch therapies for approximately 2 months, I was referred to Adam by a friend. I am an avid single digit golfer in my 40's.After my initial evlauation Adams in depth knowledge of the golf swing and body mechanics helped identify where I needed to improve and he designed a program to do it. The results have been fantastic.I highly recommend this business for any sport that involves balance, rotation and power (golf, tennis, baseball, etc.).
5	I've been going to Adam for 3 months and the improvement has been dramatic!For over 20 years I've had hip pain- chronic and no workouts helped.I knew stretching would help but didn't know of any one who would know the how and what I needed. My basketball years took their toll. After 3 weeks, I had no hip pain. He is amazing in his approach!To anyone, especially in their 40's and 50's- this is a life changer therapy.
5	I started going to GolfStretch because I was having pain while playing golf and getting numbness in my hand.  After a very thorough evaluation Dr. Mackner was able to find weaknesses in my base movements and design a program to help correct them.  Between the personal training and stretch sessions I feel better in all aspects of my life, not just my golf game.  I was able to start running and lifting weights again without the nagging pains that had been keeping me away.  I feel like I can now get back to my previously active lifestyle without being in pain or causing injury like before.  Initially the cost seems high, but it is worth way more than that to feel this good.
