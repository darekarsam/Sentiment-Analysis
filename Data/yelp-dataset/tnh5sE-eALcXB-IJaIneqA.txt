4	Nice place to have my final Sunday coffee before the short walk to platform 13 and the train to the daily grind in Glasgow. Nice bakes and fairly laid back atmosphere mean thoughts of the week ahead are kept at bay for a bit longer.
4	This little cafe in an art gallery has fantastic food -- especially if you want something a little lighter like a sandwich or a salad.  Unfortunately the service is slow, unenthusiastic, and indifferent.  However the rhubarb tartlet is worth going out of your way for.
3	The Fruitmarket is conveniently located just next to the train station which means that if you have some time to kill and fancy a coffee and/or a bite to eat, you don't need to settle for expensive and sub-par station food.   Our coffees were lovely, but our cakes left a bit to be desired as The Man's carrot cake was quite dry and my orange and almond cake was swimming in frosting/sugar drizzle and tasted nothing of almonds.  Staff were a bit funny about two people having to sit on a table for two (rather than a larger one), which I could get if it was at all busy and if we didn't have a million bags between us,  but there was only one table other than us and we ended up crammed in a corner with our bags spilling into the walkway.  Totally fine for a pre-train coffee, but not somewhere I would come otherwise.
