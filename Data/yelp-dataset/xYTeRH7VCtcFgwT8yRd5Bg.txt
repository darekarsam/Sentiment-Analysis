4	Having eaten here almost weekly for over a year, there is plenty to keep you satisfied!  Everything that you could expect from a great indian menu, with a friendly staff willing to make any necessary adjustments (light cream, extra spicy, etc.)!The chicken sandwich is a great choice for someone that isn't too familiar with Indian food.If you're looking for a consistent choice for lunch that's a little bit different, Moghel is a great decision!
3	Fancy looking restaurant in a not so fancy area- I'm guessing it's popular among the locals as it was quite full on a Friday night with large groups celebrating birthdays.Decor is tasteful, clean, booths and table are a little cramped and it gets very loud, easy to hear everything going on next to you.Presentation of food is what I liked the best, minimalist plating with eye popping colors but as expected from restaurants that try to be upscale, the portions are very small.I ordered the evening table d'hote with included an appetizer, meal and dessert for 22$. My simple butter chicken sauce was mild and creamy, great hint of coconut milk but the cubed chicken was dry once I bit into it, could have used longer marinade.Not the best Indian food, and you can get far more for less elsewhere- if you come here, you're paying for the decor and ambiance.
