3	I stopped in here just to see what they had. It's a really small store that is actually housed in the Fiesta Mall Food Court where there used to be a small fast food business. You can see the whole store from the doorway. They have a lot of accessories, cell phone covers, cords, etc.  There were two employees in there when I stopped in. I asked if a person could buy a phone card for Virgin Mobile, thinking of my daughter and how she's always having to buy cards and time, that maybe she could do it when she's already at Fiesta Mall, but the guy said that while they do sell phone cards for a large variety of companies they don't sell the ones for Virgin Mobile. I thanked him and continued on my way.
1	Got screwed over big time!! Took my phone in to have screen fixed, paid for it when it was dropped off, they said it would be done the next day, three days later it was finally done and I went to pick it up and they said that I had to pay for it again!!! They would not give me the phone and the owner called the police to make me leave the store because I would not pay a second time for the phone. Beware of this place!
1	I tried to call this place in order to get an estimate on how much it would cost to fix my phone screen. The first time they didnt answer, and a weird voicemail was played, and the second time I called a few minutes later my call was declined.
