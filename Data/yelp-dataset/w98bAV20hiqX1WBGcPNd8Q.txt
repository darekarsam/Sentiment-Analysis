4	Not a bad thing on the menu in my opinion.  The selection also has many healthy alternatives which is important to me.  This particular location I have dined at a few times now and the service is always good and they do an exceptional job of getting people in and out while maintaining a clean dining area.  The patio area at this particular location isn't that impressive due to the fact, the only real view is Independence Blvd. so keep that in mind.  And of course with all Panera Bread locations there's always the free wireless and in this day and age if a place doesn't have wireless connectivity that is a serious bummer for me.
4	Had a decent time meeting up with friends here on our way home from GA.  Our drinks, salads and sandwiches were exactly as we expected.  No evil eyes for hanging out after we were finished with our food.  Coffee is fresh!  If you like Panera, then this will meet your expectations.
1	I have been here numerous times over the last year. I have always enjoyed there lunch and the convient rapid pick up option. Sadly, my recent experience there didn't go so well. As I was biting in to my chicken salad sandwich, I noticed a LARGE METAL OBJECT. IT WAS DOWNRIGHT DISGUSTING AND DANGEROUS!!!  NOT SURE WHERE IT CAME FROM OR HOW IT WAS MISSED IN PREPERATION !!!. I was able to get my food refunded of course and the manager was polite about the situation. I will not be dining here anymore!!! . See the pics that I posted.
2	I'm  a Panera Bread fan but after this experience and their prices. hummmm.I have order the turkey cranberry flat bread and it was a total deception.
4	I'm absolutely infatuated with the "Rapid Pick-up" process. It's not only fast but accurate. To be able to just walk in past the huge line EVERY TIME and find mi food waiting in its little cubby... Magical. Oh yeah, the food is great also. Not super cheap but I... Do... Not... Care.
