4	Tuk Tuk is amoung one of the best values in the Montreal food truck scene. I really enjoy their Pad Thai and the Green Papaya Salad. Both servings are very generous meal sized so you won't walkaway hungry.
3	Yay for real Thai food! Or almost?Love the shrimp pad thai, generous serving and big shrimps - although the crab fried rice had a mix of frozen veggies (corn, peas, carrots and beans) that I'm not used to seing in the land of smiles. It was bland without adding your own soy sauce and really needs more fish sauce. For 10$ a portion, it is a fair price and a step up from your food court asian cuisine however it was lacking a certain flare. Being part Thai and having lived/traveled in and around the country, the food was good but didn't quite bring me back to what I was used to. More seasoning, spice, lemongrass and cilantro please!
