4	My favorite area pedicure spot! All of the ladies who work here are great at what they do and very professional. This is a clean shop and the price is always right. Important note: Bring cash for tips as they are not allowed on your credit or debit cards.
4	I really like this nail salon. They are very polite here, they clean all of their tools and they do fantastic work.You can usually get in within 15 minutes if you are a walk-in.The only thing I am not happy about (but they have posted so I can't complain) is you cannot add the tip to the credit card. You have to pay the tip in cash.I come here for all my manicure/pedicure/full set needs.
5	Staff is always friendly and funny. Took their time and worked on me, my girlfriend, and another customer well past close. Great work and customer service!
