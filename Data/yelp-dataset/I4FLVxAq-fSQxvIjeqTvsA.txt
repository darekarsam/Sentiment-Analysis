3	Ok, Funny Stuff!  When my husand and I first began dating we would frequent this CVS for those all important late night dating neccesities. You know, strange on sale vodka brands, late night munchies and well, for purposes of this article, we shall call them lubricated Balloons!  Although their staff constantly found our visits entertaining, they were always helpful.  This CVS is open 24hrs. however the pharmacy part closes much earlier. I fell in love with my husband thanx in part to this CVS.  HEE HEE!!!  GOOD STUFF!!!
1	Terrible pharmacy.  Never on time.  Lack of responsiveness.  No follow through.
5	I love this pharmacy, they always go above and beyond to try and help out. They are patient and understanding and always helpful. I've dealt with them for my elderly grandparents and also for my children. I've never had a bad experience in the 6 years we have been coming to this location. Keep it up guys!
