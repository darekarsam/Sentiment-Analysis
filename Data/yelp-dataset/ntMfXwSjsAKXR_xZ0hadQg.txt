5	I love this preschool! My son attends this wonderful school and he enjoys going every day.  I took a long time choosing his preschool this time, and this was by far the best one I saw. The teachers are experienced, caring, talented, creative, and responsive. Parent involvement is high, and the staff is great. When you walk through the doors, you know you are in a place that truly cares about children and their development. I am so glad I found PVCS!
5	My grandson has attended this school for 2 years and it is wonderful. The owner, Terry, knows every child and interacts with everyone in a warm and positive manner. His teacher, Kim, is fantastic and is always looking for the "teachable moment." I have been an educator myself for 30 years and I highly recommend this school!
5	We love this school and say enough good things about it! We moved our 2 kids from another school and noticed an immediate change. Our kids are happy, well behaved and excited to go to school. My 2 years old who barely spoke, started putting together sentences and now speaks all the time. My 4 year old has learned so much, she tells us about her day (which she never did) and all the things she learned. The teachers are so friendly, creative, caring and I can tell they love all the kids. It's comforting to know that when I can't be there, my kids are loved and cared for.
