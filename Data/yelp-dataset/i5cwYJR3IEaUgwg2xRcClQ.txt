4	Matt in the bike shop is a cool and very knowledgable bike tech. I stopped by with a simple question with my bike and he took a quick look at it. I am going to get my tune ups here from now on. The tune up price is very reasonable and Matt covers all the basics and more.The turn around time is about the same as other bike shops. Just remember that if you bring your bike in, the techs are also sales people on the floor so you might have to wait.I like Sports Chalet as a store too. I do a lot of online shopping but also stop by in a pinch to pick up some climbing gear or something for my bike. They also price match which is great.The staff is always friendly and cool.
5	Vaughn was the best in helping me find my daughters goalie gloves. The only info I had was she ordered them yesterday with her mom and they were pink blue and cute. Amazingly enough five min later I get a call back I have them sir. They will be waiting for you in the warehouse. ..... Vaughn your a life saver.
1	I was surprised by the size and scope of this store.  They have dive classes and just about everything you could ask for EXCEPT any level of customer service.  Perhaps I caught them on a bad day but considering it was my first and apparently last visit they really drop the ball.  I went looking for some bike equipment and possibly a new mountain bike.  3 associates were in that department so I was sure I would get help.... Nope.  20 minutes and not a single acknowledgement I was there.  Considering I needed advice to make a purchase I left empty handed.  My daughter, who wanted the $180 bike, was crushed because I had planned to get it for her but not at that level of service.  As we walked away she asked "why are we leaving" and I responded "because they obviously don't want my money here."  My 4 year understood the concept to bad Sports Chalet did not.  Sadly the clown at Walmart answered my question within 2 minutes.  Beaten by walmart!  What a joke.
