4	FREE WIFI THAT WORKS !!! was wandering around and in dire need of wifi. saw this cute little cafe & decided to grab some water and use the wifi. its a great place to take a break from shopping and walking around. cute, colorful, clean, bright little open cafe with tables, booths, and sofas. its at the end of the indoor shopping strip and a couple of the booth seats face the water.
5	Pretty sure this is how a panini is supposed to taste...amazing! Glad we stumbled upon this cafe. Yum!
1	Most overpriced canned tomato soup and two bite green salad I've ever had--came to $19 with drip coffee. Complete waste of time even for the tourist trap that is Old Montreal. Coffee was extremely weak as well--you could see the bottom of the cup.
5	Cozy wifi zone with good coffee. Brewed coffee 1.75 dollar. They sell tons of art crafts which are very expensive
4	A wonderful oasis of free functional Wi-Fi in Vieux Montreal. The boyfriend and I stopped here to rest after schlepping around in the heat. The iced coffee I received was pretty good - it was what I was expecting in terms of being loaded with sugar and milk. The boyfriend did not like his iced tea but I gladly finished it for him since I have a sweet tooth. Overall, a pleasant little respite when touring one of the most crowded areas of the city.
