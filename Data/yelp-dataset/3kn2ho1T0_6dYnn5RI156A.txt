5	Dan is the solution for genuine live bee removal. We found a hive had moved into a planter stand - an ideal home. After going through web page after too similar web page looking for bee removal, we looked for a bee keeper - and up came Dan Punch. A bee keeper, who will remove the hive live and intact, and relocate it to a location safe for us, and safe for the bees. Dan came that same evening, did a great job of explaining everything he was going to do to an enthralled 6 year old, and safely and quickly removed the hive.Great job - great people skills, and if you want, Dan will even update you on the new location and status of your hive.Thank you, Dan.
