4	This place is so cool. I love the ambiance, bright light, space tasted like art (there is a huge gallery next door) and the food is very nice. Located in the quiet area of Montreal, almost desolate. But then I guess that is good for the locals. I have only been there twice during lunch time, ordered light pasta salad and a bottle of beer. The other time was for coffee and small dessert. Both time was great.
5	They only serve lunch and cater to the local businesses. Its a little cramped but notice I still put 5 stars! It is totally worth the wait. The new tastes and flavours that they dare to mix together play on your tongue and tease your taste buds.They have a different daily menu every day with a few standard items. Absolutely a must!
