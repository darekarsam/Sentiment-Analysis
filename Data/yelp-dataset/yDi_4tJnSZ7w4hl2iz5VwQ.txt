5	Great service, nice people, very professional! I cut my finger late (8:00p) after dinner, and went to Urgent Care Extra for a few sticthes. They were great, the facility was spotless, and the attention was quick. If I need them again, and I probably will, I won't hesitate to go back!
5	Staff here is incredibly nice and friendly. Doctors listen and actually care. They also have sense of humors which is a bonus! The wait to be called back was a little long but that is to be expected this time of year!
2	The receptionist is horribly rude!  It wasnt only me that noticed but others were complaining about her as, well. The other thing is when potential patients walked in they would  blurt out very loudly "what insurance do you have" instead of how can I help you, whst are you here for?! And then they sit there and talk about the patient's insurance companies and whether it medicaid or not. Omg isnt this some kind HIPPA  violation?  Horrible horrible customer service.  I though this could be a painless trip with 2 sick kids since their pediatrician is completely booked.  The only good experience was after we were called back. The doctor was very nice.
