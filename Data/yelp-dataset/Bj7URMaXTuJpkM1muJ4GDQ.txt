4	Nice place, fairly new and well appointed.  They serve free breakfast and dinner.  Easy freeway on/off and everyone was nice.  A very good value.
4	Great place for business trips.  Friendly, helpful staff.  Big rooms.
5	Had not stayed at Homewood before   Great value and an amazing place!   From the moment we were met at the front dest by Antionette and Debra, with more personality and smile than people should be allowed to have, to a great comfortable full service room, to a wonderful breakfast to a late checkout that we needed.......this was a great experience.   The two ladies made it even more special than the already great rooms.  We will look to homewood from now on.
4	Great place to stay.  Friendly staff, and clean, big, comfy rooms.  Just wish there was better dining options nearby.
4	Beautiful, nicely furnished, spacious rooms with kitchens and full-sized refrigerators. Complimentary breakfast and dinner. Excellent service. I stay here often.
5	Great location.  Friendly staff.  I had an issue with my shower head and they replaced it immediately, without question.  Hilton breakfast in the AM does not disappoint.  Right off the I-10 so it is convenient.
5	What a place very nice with any amenities. Close to the freeway with breakfast included gym and pool. In the room I got a microwave I even got a mini kitchenette with burners and utensils and a full size refrigerator. 2 flat screen TV's 2 queen beds in room with a sofa bed in the living room area. Big nice shower and restroom. Great customer service give this place 5 stars well deserved. I just got here not even 15 mins ago and I have such peace of mind and relaxation highly recommend this hotel for families and couples.
5	We had a nice clean room for a great price. Can't beat it. Even though the building is historical, it has been kept up quite nice. If you don't need all the snobby attitude and an overpriced room, you should stay there.
