5	No one talks about their positive experiences only when it's bad they like to ramble on about how bad a situation is well I will write a positive one.  Out of the few At&t stores I've gone this one is the most friendliest and they fixed my issue with my bill and they were so willing to help. I totally recommend this location to everyone! They made sure I was happy before I left they were very thorough as well.
1	Slow, inefficient, and poor service. I walk in, no greeting, and no instruction. I wait for someone to come available. Customer service agent finishes with one customer and calls another. I ask if there is a place to check in. She points at the manager. I go to him and ask if I can exchange a product. He puts me on the list. I go to find the product I need to exchange and wait. As I'm waiting, I observe the three customer service agents assisting other customers. They are dealing with major issues. I need to exchange one product for another that I located on the shelf myself. Why can't I exchange my product without waiting in a line of customer issues?Why isn't there one person designated to deal with simple business transactions? Ridiculous. I had to WAIT 20minutes to exchange a product.
1	Store not busy on a Friday night. My husband and I changed some things on our plan and added a phone, etc. I asked a ton of times how much our new bill would be with the changes. The lady told me over and over again a $price. I asked her so many times, I could tell she was annoyed. I went in the store 5 days later and found out, while upgrading a phone, that the total bill is way higher than the Friday night lady said it would be. Not great customer service at all. The 1 star I am giving is for the nice gentleman who helped me the 2nd time I visited the store and he helped me with no hidden surprises when it comes to my new phone bill.
