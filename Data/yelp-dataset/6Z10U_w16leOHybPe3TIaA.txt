4	Dance Zone has different categories of dance, ballet, tap, jazz, Tumble Tots, Dynamics of Dance, & Explore. Each class is divided by age- youth, kindergarten, Mini (1st-2nd grade), Jr (3rd-5th grade), Teen (6-8th grade), Senior (9-12th grade).  And they also have adult classes. The classes are a 10 month program and they have a year end recital.We enrolled my son into the boys only hip hop class on Saturdays. It's a 1 hour class and right now the class is small (about 6-7 students) and is taught by Orion (?). Right now he's teaching them break dancing and my son is having a blast. Since my son is lacking in the rhythm deficient LOL Breaking is a good introduction to dancing and Orion is a great teacher. He is very good with the kids, very patient and thorough when explaining the intricacies of breaking.We are also looking to enroll our daughter soon and we have watched the other teachers in classes and they too seem to do well with the children. You can see the joy in some of the teachers passing on their craft to the little ones. DZ is a very clean dance studio and would recommend them to anyone looking for dance classes for children. There is no registration fee and $50/month for the boys hip hop class. i'm not sure on the prices for the other classes. Here is their  website: http://thedancezone.com/

Jamie and Katie are awesome role models and really practice what they preach! Everyone seems to be treated with the same respect, which is also taught in class. I love the many opportunities that are available to my daughter.
