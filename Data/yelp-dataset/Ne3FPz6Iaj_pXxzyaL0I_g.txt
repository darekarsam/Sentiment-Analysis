4	For a long time I had put of getting the heels on my favourite pair of boots fixed, it is just so easy not to! I had (like most girls I think) several other pairs of shoes that needed a new heel and I also needed to make a couple of copies of my keyes for my friends that were coming over. I went up to SOS and he fixed my shoes and copied my keyes in no-time. Now I am sure that my wonderful boots will last me a few more seasons! The cobbler was friendly, fast and gave me a very decent price. When the day comes (and it will come) when I need more shoes fixed I will definetly go back!
