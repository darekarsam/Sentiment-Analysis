4	Neat small pawn shop.  You can find things along the lines of what you would expect at a pawn shop, tools, jewelry, guns, etc.  Traditional pawn with a kick so it was cool.  You can get a tattoo as well at this pawn shop if you make the needed appointment.
5	Ok, so who would have thunk a pawn shop could be an attraction.  Only in Cave Creek Arizona!  Cave Creek is one of the funkiest eclectic places I know of.  Cave Creek has a delightful cast of characters and cool things to see and do at just about every inch of this small one stop sign town.  The latest and newest addition to this potpourri of fun stuff and interesting things to do in Cave Creek is Wild West Pawn.  I've never been in a pawn shop like it.  They should have their own TV show!  If you think Pawn Stars has cool things, wait until you visit Wild West Pawn.   REALLY fun eclectic stuff from Cars & motorcycles to saddles and lots wild west stuff.  Can't wait visit them in Cave Creek but want to check them out?  Visit them at their website and on Facebook to check out current shop of goodies.  You can even bid in an online auction on some of their stuff by going to AuctionNation  website and navigate to their auction.  Just look for Wild West Pawn.  There is truly something for everyone.  Can't wait to go again.  Rich and the gang down at Wild West Pawn will take care of you.

4	This place is a must see. Not a run of the mill pawn shop while your at it go on Friday night for the food truck and music events. Not your normal food trucks either. So grab some food and be prepared to travel back in time thought the southwest history at some some of the most amazing items you will find anywhere. You won't be sorry!
