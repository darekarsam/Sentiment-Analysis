2	Burger King works hard to compete with the likes of McDonald's, Wendy's , Carl, Jr, etc, but never seems to get it quite right. Regrettably I might add since their burgers have a unique taste because of the broiling of their meat patties. As for this location, the chain tries hard and seems to execute. The employees are happy and helpful, more concerned with the customer experience which is great.  Recently they were running a buy one, get one free campaign on their Wopper, which they were willing to exchange for a Classic Chicken sandwich. Nice job!
4	I hate to admit that I come here often but it's soooo close to work and I find their onion rings  irresistible despite the fact I don't care much for onions. If I'm getting fast food, chances are I'm not getting out of my car - this place is no exception, so I can't say much about the cleanliness of the restaurant or bathrooms. There is one lady who is ALWAYS working, it never fails. She is awesome, always smiling, super friendly and never forgets to hook me up with ketchup and anything else I may require. My order is always the way I ordered it, hot and quick.
