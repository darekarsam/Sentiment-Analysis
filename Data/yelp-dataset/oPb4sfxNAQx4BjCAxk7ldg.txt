5	I see Dr Ian and as I'm still numb faced writing this I would like to say he is absolutely the most patient and caring dentist I have ever had. I am incredibly nervous when it comes to pain ( funnily enough ) but I have never felt as though this is an issue, he is gentle and kind and puts my worries before the clock... I would 100% recommend him as a dentist for those who have nerve issues like myself!
