3	Standard Jersey Mike's Chain store.  I was the only customer on a weeknight and the people were super nice.  They even brought my sandwich to me when it was ready.  It was to go, so I got home and happily scarfed the sandwich down in a couple of minutes.The cool thing I found on this visit was that they had a little touch screen computer near the register where you can "check-in" as a frequent customer using your cell phone and they send you coupons and offers via text messaging.  You redeem the coupons on that little touch screen input device.
3	Delish subs! Had an Italian sub today. Fresh everything! So much better than Subway.
4	Jersey Mike's is probably one of the best if not the best chain sub shops in Charlotte. The meats and breads are always freshly sliced and super tasty. This particular store is very well ran. The staff is extremely friendly. They are always polite, professional, and fast.
2	I just tried the Jersey Mike's in Salisbury and it makes these guys look like pikers. They should take a drive up there and see how they really should be doing things.
5	Great subs! Love the meatball parm! Staff is helpful and friendly and the owner is a very nice man! Great way to support local business owners! Shop is very clean too!
2	I have had Jersey Mikes once before and I liked it enough to try it again. This location proved to disappoint. The bread was soggy and my meatball sub was lukewarm. I ordered the middle size but was given the largest one and was forced to pay. The meatballs were tasted cold and mushy. I will not be back. I will stick to my Firehouse sub habit
