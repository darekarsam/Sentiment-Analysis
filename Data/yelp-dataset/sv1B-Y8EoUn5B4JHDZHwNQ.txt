3	The food is ok and oversauced but it's one of the better places for your money at the Premium Outlets North food court. Unless you want to pay for a $10 footlong next door. Their portions are huge and they seem to pack up your box which is great if you're hungry or sharing. If you get a 3 item it barely will fit in the box lol. I recommend getting a large drink because they charge for refills here. They got a C rating from the health district, which I didn't notice until I had eaten here multiple times, but I haven't gotten sick and still eat here when I work long shifts at the mall. This is the best option in the food court unless they open a Panda Express which has better food in my opinion
2	I was craving noodles and this was the closest fast food joint that carried anything close to noodles. Plus I needed to carb load for an upcoming race.Admittingly, the portion is generous. I ordered a 2-item combo with chow mein, sesame chicken (orange chicken) and tofu as well as a drink. Total $11. Fast food and one of the only places of choice in the outlet center. Soft drink refills are .49 cents. I think next time I'll get the pizza for a little more filling.
1	They wouldnt refill my cup of water! What place doesnt allow its customers to drink tap water? Such rude service
