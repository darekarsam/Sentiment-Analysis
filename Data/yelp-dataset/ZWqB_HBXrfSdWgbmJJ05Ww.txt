5	Best acupuncturist I have ever had! Very relaxed and accommodating atmosphere. I always feel an immediate result after my sessions and find that my overall health, physical and mental, have improved a lot since I started going to Heartpath Community Acupuncture regularly. And the best part...I can actually afford to go because I set the price I will pay. Can't beat this really. If you are at all interested in acupuncture treatment, I highly recommend you check this out. Nothing to loose!
5	I have been getting acupuncture from Dan Cubacub at Heartpath for years for general health, tune-ups and specific ailments and injuries.   I no longer live in Madison but whenever I am there I get at least a few sessions with him.  I got sessions once a week when I lived there.   I love Dan and the Heartpath space.  I love his treatments and it will always be hard for anyone else to compare to him.  It is truly his dharma.  He was born to serve us with acupuncture.
5	Dan's the man! I have only been to acupuncture once and it was at Heartpath,  It was a great experience and I applaud Dan for putting up with my skittishness (I am terrified of needles).The experience was like a therapy session.  Dan talks with you about your daily life and how it weighs on you.  Then he focuses on certain areas to relieve things like stress or pain. He placed needles from my toes to my face.  It didn't hurt and he used needles that were in sealed packages.  His location is very clean and comforting. It felt like I had a massage after I was finished and I was super relaxed.  Like I said before, I haven't been for acupuncture anywhere else, so I can't say how Dan does things compared to another location, but I can tell you that I felt at ease even though I hate needles and that I would go back if it wasn't so expensive*.*Heartpath was actually cheaper than the other places that I checked out. I think it cost me $70 for the session and it lasted about an hour.
