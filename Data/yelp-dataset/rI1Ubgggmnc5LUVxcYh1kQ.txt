3	Elvis has left the building.  Rather, Elvis has entered the building.  Yes, Elvis is alive and well and in the Stallings area.  At least some nights.We stopped purely on a lark to check out this Italian restaurant and were somewhat surprised to find an Elvis impersonator, and not only did he do quite well at Elvis, we learned a few facts about Elvis from his able assistant, but Elvis did some other songs as well (gospel and showtunes).  It was quite the musical performance.As to the restaurant, unfortunately, things weren't quite as good.  The service was average, even on the slow side, and the food really wasn't all that great.  But definitely check out Elvis.  Much easier than flying to Las Vegas.
1	Yet another bad restaurant in this same site. We have lived here 5 years-3 different restaurants-this local must be jinxed. The food actually made my husband and I sick! They say "home cooked" and it was truly something a home cook would prepare. No presentation, bad decor, and very slow service. Prices were high for the quality of food presented.This one is named Bosewell's.
1	I am convinced that the kitchen in this restaurant contains only two things. A freezer and a microwave. There is absolutely nothing they serve that is worth the trip.And, their hours are incredible. Apparently they can survive being open for approximately three hours a day. We actually joke when we are driving by and make bets as to whether they will be open or closed!
