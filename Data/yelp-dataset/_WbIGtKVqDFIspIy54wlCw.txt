5	Good selection, reasonable prices and fast service. I can usually get in and out of here in about 20 minutes.  The staff is always courteous and they treat my ride as if it was their own.  Service is Top Shelf!
5	I am happy to report that I have gone back to the Ted Wiens store that did the repair work on my van for 10 years.  If you have read about the fiasco I experienced at Royalty Tire and Brake with my Buick, you know that I had to change auto mechanics.  Now, I am back where I belong.  The mechanics are true to their advertising campaign ...."slightly obsessive" in doing it right and they are very competent.  Why I ever strayed, I must tell you.  (The owner of RT&B, Rudy, was a customer where I work and he promised me that he would take care of me.)  So very happy to be back at Ted Wiens.  I've learned my lesson.  Loyal again.  Ted Wiens - You're the BEST!!!!!
5	the customer service and mechanical ability  at this shop is second to none,  service advisor Steve Duerler  is a class act and  the techs are actual mechanics not just tire and  oil change guys,being an autobody tech  most of the time i do my own repairs and im always skeptical letting anyone else  work on my car but here you feel at home and confident  right away,The repairs to my Buick were done fast and professionally even while sitting there waiting for them to complete the repairs you hear how they deal with every customer that comes in like we are their family its nice to know theres still buisnesses out there who just get it and know how to treat people ill never go anywhere else with my cars....5++stars...great job Ted Wiens
