5	It's simple: Great people work here!
5	Midfirst Bank is what banks used to be back in the day.  Someone always answers the phone.  There's always a smile and just enough friendly chit chat.  They remember me when I walk in!  Most importantly, my financial questions are answered and my financial needs are met.  My girls get suckers and smiles every time.  I half think my dog would get a bone if I took him through the drive-thru.  I am extremely happy with Midfirst and I second how great Brad is although I'll add that I like everyone there!
