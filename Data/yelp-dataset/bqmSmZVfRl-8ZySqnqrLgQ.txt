4	As far as smog checks go, this place gets the job done. There are 2 lanes and it's a very smooth process.  You can get in and out in 5 minutes. They send out a mailer with a coupon when it's time for my renewal from the DMV. It's $16 for the check and they will also renew your registration on site. I always do it from home but it's an option.
5	Went there to do a quick smog check! It's right by DMV, cheap with free car wash at Terrible 's car wash, they speak good English and it's at a nice gas station!Best place to do your smog check!!!
3	Opened Monday through Saturday, 10am-530pm. Came today to get it done before end of month but he tells me we disconnected our battery recently and it failed, saying we have to drive another 75 miles and come back!Since neither my husband nor myself had done anything to the battery we couldn't figure it out, but we drove to Pahrump and back through redrock and down to Henderson just so we'd get that mileage. Not knowing they weren't open Sunday! We also remembered, oil change last Tuesday and they did a battery check! Woohoo that's the deal, husband taking it back tomorrow, hopefully it's passed this time. Guy was nice about it but it's a bother to go back and present our case, he said 'our computer does lie, it's pretty smart'
