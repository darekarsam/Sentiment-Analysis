4	This is a good urgent care to choose in the Surprise area. The wait can be long,  but you get that anywhere these days. Dr. Ash is very "comforting" in his approach. My son is 6 and he took great care in his examination of symptoms.Friendly staff. Clean office. Pleasant waiting area. They also offer online check in. I would choose them over Fast Med anyday.
5	I have lived in Surprise for 5 yrs and wish I knew about this place a lot sooner. I will never go to another urgent care again. I've been twice and each time we were in,and out in under an hr. The first time we were in and out within 40 min, the second time 20-25 minutes! There was no ridiculously long wait while waiting on the prescription and we didn't need to sign any discharge paperwork! Everyone was nice, and the place was clean!
1	Been to this clinic before and it was fine.  Today was the worst experience, that I had to leave.  When I got there I was the only patient to be seen.  Waited ten minutes, then was taken to the back and put in the room.  Was told I couldn't leave the door open even though it was extremely hot because of the hepa law.  Fine if the office had other patients but I was the only one there.  The doctor was no where to be found.  So now it's 15 minutes and I move to the outside waiting room since I am on oxygen and need to be in a cool area.  The doctor still no where to be seen, so after 45 minute wait I left without seeing anyone.  So if you don't mind waiting forever even when no is there this place is for you.
