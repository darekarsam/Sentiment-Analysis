5	I came across this chocolate shop last night. Although I didn't buy chocolate, everything looked nice. I decided to get a brownie and can honestly say it is the best brownie that I have ever had. It was rich, decadent and had an amazing chocolate flavor. It was fudge like and soft. Wish I had the recipe!
4	Wow, try the salted carmel chocolates! They are exquisite. This shop can get a little pricy depending on your level of chocolate addiction, so just buy what you need, & love. The chocolate cupcake had great flavor but was a tad dry on this day, so I took a star off the overall review.
5	Discovered this little gem years ago and decided to revisit the place today to see if what I tasted back then wasn't a fluke. Well, it wasn't! That brownie I ate years back is still as decadent and extremely cochon! Not only is it chocolatey and fudgey as you'd expect of a brownie, you're in for a little surprise here and there. In it, you'd be treated to little speck of chocolate chips-ish that simply exploded in your mouth for more chocolatey goodness.The chocolate chips cookies are loaded with buttery and chocolatey goodness. I can barely go through one and that is saying something.They do sell those chocolate bite as well as jams, their laud hot chocolate and a new offering, ice cream.The place is tucked away from pretty much everything unless you live in the neighborhood or spend some time at Laurier park.Price is fair. The brownie cost less than $4.50 for quite a big square. Any bigger and expect a trip to the emergency room..PS. They have those homemade Vachon caramel cake that looked tasty
