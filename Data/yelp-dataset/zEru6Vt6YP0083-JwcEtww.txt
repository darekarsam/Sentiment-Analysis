1	Gas is cheap but.....Service sucks! they don't even acknowledge you when you're at the counter. If it wasn't for their cheap as heck gas I'd ask for the place to be demolished! Don't go inside, just pay with your visa at the pump and go.
3	Cheap gases.  Prices are different if you pay with cash or if you pay with credit/debit cards.
4	Located at 44th St. and McDowell Road easy access to the 202 and Phoenix sky Harbor international Airport. They have a set of twin brothers at work here; they are always nice and friendly. I have never had any problems getting gas here are getting to quick snack or something to drink. It appears that they are renovating and adding more space to the store. I will return soon as always!
