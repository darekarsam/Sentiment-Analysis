5	If you have an older vehicle that doesn't mind ARCO AM/PM gas then this is the spot.  They are usually up to 10 cents cheaper than the competition. I paid $3.29 a gallon for unleaded last night.Its not the cleanest store nor best of customer service but who cares?  I just want cheap gas!My newer vehicle, Mitsibushi Galant, she hates AM/PM gas LOL she wines and groans.My Dodge Ram doesn't seem to mind which makes me more happier than a woodpecker in an lumber yard.
3	Yes they do have cheaper gas but they have different prices for those who uses cards than cash, they charge fee to use your card compare to you using cash. It's worth it if you wanted to put gas with cash but I personally think it's the same price if you are using credit/debit in other gas station.
4	If you forgot cash just use the Chase atm located inside. The workers here have always been courteous regardless of what day or time I visit. Haven't noticed any panhandlers loitering as around which is a plus. All in all good location and consistently has cheapest prices in town.
