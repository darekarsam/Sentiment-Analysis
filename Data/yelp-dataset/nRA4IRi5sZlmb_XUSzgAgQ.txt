5	Victor is the fastest! You don't spend your precious time time waiting for an over booked stylist.  Walk in with a need for a cut and walk out with a new look.  The shop is convenient to all areas of town.  Go get pampered.
5	Victor is excellent.  Not only is he very skilled in cut and color, his prices are reasonable.  I have received compliments on my cut and have many friends who now go to him and are very happy.  You won't be disappointed.  The staff is friendly and courteous as well.
5	I was new to town and had to find a new stylist. I found Qu at Esmero Salon and I have to say she is AWESOME!! The salon is really cute and comfortable. She did a great job on my cut and color. The color we chose was a great choice for me. The end result was a fabulous cut and awesome color. My hair shines it looks so healthy and it's so soft. My hair has never looked so good before. I can't stop swinging it around and touching my hair! Also...Qu has a personality which made it very easy to talk to her. I would very much recommend Esmero. I will be coming back.
