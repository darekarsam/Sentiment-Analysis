4	Total Diving is a great SCUBA Diving shop in Montreal. Their staff are very knowledgeable of products and they offer great teaching services.
1	I stopped in this weekend to pick up some snorkelling gear for my vacation.  After waiting about 15 minutes before I had to ask for help, I explained that my main goal for next summer was to take my SCUBA courses at Total Diving so I wanted to pick up a good mask and snorkel.  Though I'm only snorkelling, this year, I wanted to get informed as to what differentiates a mediocre set from a great set.  Sadly, in my short research of what I should purchase, it seems that I've gained more knowledge than the gentleman serving me.  He did't know what a dry snorkel was or even what a semi-dry snorkel was.  This was disturbing, considering that's all they had in stock.  Instead, he showed me a bunch of cheap, basic, semi-dry snorkels and pointed out that they were dry.  Sadly, they were not.Considering their less than impressive knowledge level in the most basic of diving equipment, I decided not to purchase anything and visit some of the other dive shops in Montreal, this week.  I've also decided to do my research, in greater depth, to find a place to take my courses, next summer, because it certainly won't be here.  If you don't know the difference between snorkels, I'm not sure I want to put my life in your hands.Less than confidence inspiring, guys...
