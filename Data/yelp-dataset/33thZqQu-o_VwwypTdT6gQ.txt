4	Chez Lien is some sort of franchise. I've never been to any other location, but this one is quite good. Slightly upscale, meaning it's not a hole in the wall like some Vietnamese restaurants. But it's not fancy either. We like to sit next to the fish tank so the kids can watch the fish. They have kids' specials. My wife loves the curry chicken. This isn't a Pho house, so don't look for Phos or Buns. But grilled meat over rice is very good. Bring your own wine!Price-wise I was between $ and $$. I would say $9-$14 meals before tax and tip.
3	Simple and tasty, an overall good meal. We were the only ones in the restaurant, which worried me slightly, but once the food started arriving, all fears were laid to rest. The soup was hot and flavorful, the salads were fresh, and the meats (steak, chicken, and shrimp) were grilled perfectly. Nothing fancy, just simple and good.I would caution against the green tea ice cream (which I ordered based on favorable comments on another review site). It was obviously partially thawed then re-frozen giving it that awful gritty texture. It was like eating ice cream with a handful of sand mixed in. Yech.
2	Very poor tasting, very far from Authentic Viet food (I found in my Pho Soup following vegetables : carrots, brocoli, califlower etc...). Service is approximate, I ask for Nguo Nam (aka fish sauce) and they bought me some spring roll sauce...?!?! And they don't have teapot... Seriously, in an Asian restaurant ?Prices seems alright and they offer BYOB but not recommanded by or for Asian people.
