5	I highly recommend Fiesta Furnishing!  The staff is extremely professional with a wonderful sense of  style.  I was able to furnish most of my house with quality pieces and still stay within my design budget.  The management is top notch!  I will definitely return to purchase additional accessories and beautiful carpets!
2	If ur not a middle aged or older women from scottsdale and loaded don't plan on getting any help. There's some great furniture and the name says it all Fiesta.
3	The showroom is great and the staff is very helpful ( some times too much) we purchased our bedroom set here and I love it. This would have been a five star review if I had not find a similar set for a lot less some where else..
