4	Brand new Petsmart location in the Carolina Place plaza at South Boulevard and I-485. I believe they simply relocated from across the way, but who cares? That one is closed, this one is open. Hooray.All the usual stuff for dogs, cats, birds and fish on sale here including pet food, treats, beds, carrying cases, medications and grooming tools. This store also has an outlet of the Banfield veterinarians and they have an on-premise groomers.
4	I use the groomers here every month. They are always very nice, and do a consistent job on my pup. The store is clean? And I was able to get help when I had some questions about dog products. I have been approached a few times in the parking lot by wandering people asking for money, which is a lil annoying.
4	Kittens and cats for adoption here. Come see them if you have a good home to offer. They are so adorable! I wish I could adopt them all.They also do pet grooming at this location.I was in search of cat grass for my boy tabby, Burrito and was able to get that and some cat nip for him. I wanted to bring home another cat, but remained strong knowing that 2 big cats is all my condo will tolerate.  The people were helpful too.
