1	*********** In Poker a MECHANIC ........ is a thief ******************** In auto repair ............Greulich's is a Mechanic ******** They are super expensive, No I mean ULTRA EXPENSIVE.They'll find an entire pecking list of things, that they'll suggest, you let them repair. I wouldn't go anywhere near, any of their multiple locations.If you enjoy. being played ... any of Greulich's many locations, will obligue you.
4	I needed the bottom part of my car repaired after a few bolts came off and left one of the flaps hanging. I went to O'Reilys auto parts hoping I could purchase a few bolts and and repair it myself before I headed back to California. O'Reily's on Golddust and Scottsdale Road suggested I go to Greulich's On Scottsdale Road right up the street in the all about tennis parking lot.  I did and Mr.Arroyo was so incredibly efficient and nice and was extremely generous! I would use there services again!
4	The Greulichs s on Scottsdale Rd. has been honest and have serviced my cars for the past few years. Jay always checks over the car and the work and the price has been fair.
5	I have been to this location (Scottsdale Rd just south of Shea) several times over the last 3 years and been impressed every time with Jay's knowledge and service. They give realistic expectations for the amount of time the service and repairs would take and the cost has never exceeded what I was told. My car was a 1999 pathfinder with high mileage and I would have gotten rid of it sooner if I did not feel so comfortable with Jay and his team.I should have written this review a long time ago but now I am because earlier this week I brought my new car (it's a 2010 Ford Edge) had a few engine lights on and it has been driving a little funny. Jimmy told me to come right in and he would scan it at no charge. He scanned it and it came up with a diagnosis of specific to the emissions system which he thought may still be covered by the manufacturers warranty. I called Bell Ford (they will be my next review...and it WON'T be good) and I gave the year/make/model of the car and they told me it would likely still be covered but I had to bring it in. After my terrible experience with Bell Ford I called Jimmy from Greulich's back and he asked me for the service advisor's phone number so he could straighten things out for me.Bottomline...excellent service, hardworking and honest guys
4	they did my oil change, filter change, tire rotation, etc in pretty good time considering they didn't have the filter i needed and went and got it for me at no extra charge. But what impressed me the most was the customer service of the guy at the front desk. i didn't catch his name, i wish i would have. i ended up hugging him because his friendly service really made my terrible day much better. I've only been the one time to this one location, but i will probably return if (heaven forbid) i have to have anything done to my car.
5	Hi, I've been going to this Greulich's location for a few months now and I have to say, they have the BEST customer service I've ever experienced with an automotive service shop! It's always very fast, very affordable, and the people who work there make you feel like family. In particular, Jim is hands-down the best manager I have met anywhere! He is so polite, informative, helpful and just takes great care of everyone who walks through the door! He's been great to me and that's why I keep coming back. I notice that he treats every customer like they are truly the best and that he is honored to work with them. I had a bad migraine last weekend when I was in and without asking, he lowered the tv sound and was very quiet during the hour I was there. When it was time to leave, he gave me an incredible deal on all the things that needed to be fixed and said he didn't want to bother me earlier because I told him I had a migraine! Now THAT is amazing customer service... Definitely highly recommend this company!
5	Took my car Into another car shop for an oil change and came out with $1600 worth of additional repairs that were "needed." When I took it to Greulich's for a second opinion they let me know that there was absolutely nothing wrong with the car. They are honest to work with, give great service, less expensive than many other shops, and always friendly!
