5	Animal advocates is amazing. It's quite honestly a hidden gem and not a place I would have found on my own with out the aide of thrifting goddess friend of mine. A small shop not really made for more than 1 or 2 people at a time. It's also probably not ideal for small children. Additionally, mind the sign and open the door nice and slow as there is usually a cat or two hanging out inside and you don't want to let them out. It's has a mix of some clothes and a lot of weird nicknacks and miscellaneous items. The three rooms are filled to the brim and the prices are incredibly low.While it's not the type of place I'd go to fill out my winter or summer wardrobe, but it's great for unique finds.
5	Halloween 2014 was looking for some affordable vintage HALLOWEEN items and scored here. Its only open until 3pm everything was reasonably priced and i got a huge plastic light up Pumpkin from the 1970/80 for $10 which i have seen in antique store for $60 and for $2 a black cat cut out i saw new in ROSS DRESS FOR LESS for $25, small store but worth the trip for knick knacks or some pet stuff, no clothes, just some jewelry or china.
