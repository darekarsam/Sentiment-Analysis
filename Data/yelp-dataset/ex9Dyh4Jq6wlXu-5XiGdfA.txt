5	I have used these guys for checking a head on my Ford and they were also very helpful in advising as to if it would be more expensive to repair or replace it. They spent a good amount of time helping me out and did great work. I was referred by a friend that uses them a lot.
5	Awesome shop with a friendly staff that will tell you like it is, they won't hose you and sell you a bunch of stuff you don't need. My family has been using them for years.
5	These guys are great!  Honest, reliable, and reasonable.
