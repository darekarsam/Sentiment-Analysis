3	Okay, so it's fast food. But it's fast food in a kinda old-timey way that reminds me of when I was a kid. There is nothing plastic or fake in this place.Nice burgers and dogs. And I had the poutine, which was really quite good. Now I finally understand what the canadians see in this dish. If I lived in Montreal, I could see me eating a lot more of this stuff. And I'd weigh a lot more too.
