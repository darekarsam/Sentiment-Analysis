5	I stopped by to grab some groceries and this is the second time here to grab sushi rolls already! The rolls are great fora quickpick up for the kiddies with their sushi cravings! The Haedupbap is awesome! It's a sashimi salad that come with a little rice underneath! Will always come back.... The couple that owns this shop is so friendly and welcoming! Thank you Sakura Sushi!
4	Don't let the food court setting fool you, this place has got it goin' on.A flat $6 for any roll on their menu- and this includes Vegas rolls, Hawaiian rolls, and about twelve other varieties. It's not a crazy-extensive menu, but it's definitely more than Cali, Philly, and shrimp tempura.Fish is fresh, rolls aren't skimpy, presentation is on par with a stand-alone restaurant even when you order to-go, and the staff is super friendly to boot. They don't mind making tweaks or substitutions, either- I often add lemon, green onion, or garlic ponzu.Just found my new place for getting takeout: 3 rolls under $20 AND I get to take my pants off and watch Netflix? Done.
5	It's my Monday tradition to come here for lunch. This place is amazing. The food court itself looks pretty sketchy but the sushi from this place is fresh, good priced, and delicious. The people that work there are very nice and courteous. They go above and beyond. I definitely recommend this place to anyone!
1	We went to eat this afternoon it's so disappointed. The service is bad and the food tasty is just ok. But the chefs they make order so slowly. It took us about 3 hour to wait and we didn't get the all orders what we made. We just ordered some nigiri sushi. But they couldn't even make it in 3 hours. We cancelled the order and left. So bad to try this restaurant never back.
