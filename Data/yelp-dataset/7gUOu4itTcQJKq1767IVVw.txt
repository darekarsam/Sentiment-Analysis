4	I absolutely love the pizza here! If I can offer any advice, ask for extra sauce, sometimes they don't put enough. They've been making pizza the same way for at least 30 years. I'm starting to feel old!!! Like most great pizza places... This one is also a bit of a dive. But it's good.
5	Best pizza ever brings me back to childhood "cornet pizzeria"!!!!!!!
4	You have to like that type of thick greasy pizzaIt is awesome pizza although they can be inconsistent sometimes
