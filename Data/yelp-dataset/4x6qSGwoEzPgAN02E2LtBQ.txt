5	Don't be deterred by the $15 price tag, it was worth every penny. My girlfriend and I arrived about 15 minutes after it opened at 11, and that seems to be the best time to get there. It wasn't crowded and we went into the maze with a small group of about 10 people. It's so much fun running around in a big playground like a little kid. We're both 19 and we couldn't have had a better time running through the obstacles with the 4 and 5 year olds. The storyline is stupid, but who cares? You're in a giant maze! It's kind of exhausting though. Bring some bottled water.
