5	Great bead shop!!! Ladies are the best. Great claases. Go check out their store!
2	Tiny little narrow shop. I had my girls with me.....sign on the front door saying "please hold children's hands".  Code for "we don't like kids".  We circled the store then left. Nothing that I couldn't live without so we left. So I guess this review is based solely on atmosphere.
4	They had a good selection and prices were okay. Not much to say...they are out of business now.
