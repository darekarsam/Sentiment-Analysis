2	Fish suppers here are really hit or miss.Sometimes they're quite good- they're always enormous, and when freshly made the batter is crispy and chips are decent.Other times though they're really not brilliant. I've had old (really fishy) fish, and most recently my fish had been sitting in the warmer for too long (surprising considering it was Friday night at around 8) which left it dry with thick soggy batter.The price is very good considering the portion size but after my recent poor supper I was barely able to eat half of it so hardly worth the size.
