5	This place is such a special little find. We stumbled upon them in Pittsburgh Public Market one fine Saturday. They have such a delicious spread of rotating goodies, whole skinned rabbits, homemade terrines, local cheeses and sauces, and homemade sausages. Oh the homemade sausages! I've been on friendly speaking terms with sausages for many years, but not a huge fan. Their beef, marrow, mushroom, and red wine sausages fill my dreams. Expensive but so worth it.
5	Crested Duck Charcuterie is a wonderful treasure in Pittsburgh!  Using locally sourced ingredients, Chef Kevin creates incredibly delicious, often unique, cured meats, pates, and accouterments. What an exciting adventure to sample the salamis, sausages, rillettes, and bacons!  Or, purchase their farm-raised elk, bison, rabbit, or many other varieties of meat and create your own masterpiece.  They even provide delectable recipes on their website!
5	I love this little place, and I'm very happy they opened up another store.  Definitely want to keep these folks in business.  You absolutely have to try the duck prosciutto; it will change your life. They also sell a bunch of artisanal meats/products that I really don't think you can find anywhere else in the city.  If you know how to cook with all of the products that they sell, well, you're a better chef than I.  Last time I was there, they even had haggis!!  One last tip...if they have the lemon preserves, buy them; it's basically salted chopped lemon & olive oil.  Heat some olive oil (not to hot!) add a teaspoon or two of preserves, and let it marinate.  Strain, then use the oil to make a kick-ass home made Italian dressing.  If you're a foodie, or if you just like good food, you have to check this place out.
