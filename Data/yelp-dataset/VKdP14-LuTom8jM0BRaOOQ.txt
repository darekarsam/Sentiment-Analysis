5	Are you tired of always doing all the work for your Realtor? Can't get hold of your Realtor most of the time? Tired of talking to their asst and not the Realtor you hired? Not getting fast service & answers?? Well, it is because you do not have Chris Patrick representing you. As seniors over 55, we have encountered many Realtors in our lifetime. SERVICE IS KEY TO US !!!!! He is also very polite, professional & knowledgeable. If he does not know the answer, you can bet he will go that extra mile to find out for you. What more can you ask for in a Realtor. Call him, you can bet he will answer.
5	Chris has been nothing short of a great person to know in general very level headed guy to know and be around. Outside of that it turns out I needed some help looking for a new place. He built my own page with the specifics that I'm looking for only and I get regular updates for places that match that. I like knowing Chris as a friend and working with him for my real estates needs.
5	Chris is a class act. I'm honored to be associated with a fine professional in this rugged city.
