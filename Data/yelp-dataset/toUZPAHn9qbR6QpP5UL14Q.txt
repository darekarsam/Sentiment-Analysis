5	Important stuff first: the coffee beans are roasted locally by Cartel and Xanadu, the toddy (cold brewed coffee) is perfect, the pour overs and the espresso pulls are done correctly and with care. The coffee game is strong here. In addition to standard cafe offerings, they also do Thai iced tea and Vietnamese-style sweet coffee. They will also make you an exclusive "Toddsmore" if you catch them at the right time. Worth noting is that the baristas are down-to-earth folks that won't ridicule newcomers if they order something only found at chains. Something I've seen happen all to often at other spots.Now for the fun stuff: Located in a multi-use artist space The Hive, Demi is right in the front. The place is tiny, but there's enough room for a few people to hang out or work on their laptops. The decor features local art and a small TV showing random VHS finds that the owners pick-up from thrift stores. Thankfully, the audio to the movies is off and instead music is played over the speakers.After coming here a few times a week for over a two month period, I'm happy to recommend them to anyone looking for a unique offering in the ever growing coffee options of downtown Phoenix.

Good stuff even without sweetening by agave nectar.    My customer card is in the registry, a new installation is going up in The Hive Gallery. I plan to return in search of five stars and discover if Cartel can compete with Ozone of London.  I'm looking for a local bean as good as Ozone's.
