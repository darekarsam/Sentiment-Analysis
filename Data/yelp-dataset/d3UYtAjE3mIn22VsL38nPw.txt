4	This place has the best soft-served ice cream in town. The texture is slightly different than one would expect.  The ice cream isn't as frozen as typical soft-served which creates this creamy/velvety texture. It doesn't melt away like frozen yogurt which is great, especially if you get it in the cone! Speaking of the cone, it's delicious! If you get the cup, you're missing out unless you want to have toppings. I never had any, the ice cream is so good that it doesn't need any additives. I also bought a few chocolates which were also yummy but a bit overpriced. I give this place 4 stars because the chocolate is over the price point for the quality/taste and the location could be better as in bigger or better located to enjoy the ice cream. No place to sit, you have wander aimlessly in PMT.
5	Let's be real, ice cream shops are a dime a dozen. The flavours and quality found here is what sets them apart.Ice cream: they have different types of swirl cones such as vanilla/Belgian chocolate, strawberry/passion fruit (which tastes great!) and raspberry/maple syrup (sounds sexy eh?). you can also ask for only one flavour if you're feeling like a plain jane. I was in the mood for a classic, but here's the twist, I had it dipped in dark chocolate. It was amazing ! Service : very nice and fast. Prices are pretty much like everywhere else's but better ice cream.
2	I don't know about this one, since it's really nothing to it and the truffles and all variety of chocolate was just okay.Nice merchandising and friendly service.
