5	Valentin is a fantastic tailor who can make anything from scratch, alter suits and make your favorite pants fit better again. He's done several things for me over the years and his work is exceptional. Get that old stuff out of the closet and bring it over.
5	My wife just had a Pea Coat tailored by Valentine (owner of Valenti Custom Tailoring). She is thrilled with the fit. Another great job.
5	Valentin does phenomenal work! I ordered a couple of cheap suits online for a deal that was too good to pass up and he made them look like a million bucks. He took all the tags off and hemmed the pants and now I am stylin' and profilin'! I will definitely be back soon!
5	Valentin Mudreac is terrific and I really can't recommend his place enough. I've had two suits fitted for me at Valenti. Valentin takes time to assess every aspect of how the garment fits to make sure it's right. Valentin is professional and personable. He's remembered me, referring to me by name, every time since the first time I've came in the shop. Great customer service. Also, I had a rush job that he was able to complete for me without complaint or surcharge. Valentin also has a good sense of style. He knows what's current and what looks best. His central location is terrific. I'm glad his store is here and I expect it will remain for a long time to come.
