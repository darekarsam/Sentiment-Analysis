5	This place is absolutely awesome!  They have very reasonable prices and every vet I have seen is very knowledgeable and they don't do unnecessary tests.  Got recommended to go here from a friend and would I never go anywhere else!
5	I have two black labs and I have tried several different boarding kennels. This is my favorite and the dogs love it there too. I really like that it's attached to the veterinary clinic. I also take my dogs to the vets there.
1	Prices have gone through the roof! I was quoted $350 and then I was handed a $570 bill.
