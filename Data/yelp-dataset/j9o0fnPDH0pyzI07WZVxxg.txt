5	Kim is the type of hairdresser you follow wherever she goes. She is amazing at color, great at cuts and blowouts.  I love my hair!!!
5	Kim is an excellent hair stylist!  I get asked all the time who does my color and cut !I highly recommend her!,
5	I go to Charlotte once a month for business from New York and I always book an appointment with Kim for my color and cut.  She is amazing!!!  I like to be fashion forward with my hair but yet still conservative enough for business.  She knows me and exactly what I want before I do.  I even flew her in to do my hair for my wedding in Ireland.  With all the salons in New York City I haven't found a hair dresser that I fell in love with like I did Kim.
