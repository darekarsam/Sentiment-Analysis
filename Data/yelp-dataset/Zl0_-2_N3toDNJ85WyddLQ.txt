5	If you are looking for a down to earth, patient, understanding, knowledgeable, professional, passionate and fun golf instructor, Shane Crosley is the guy to see!I've had 4-5 lessons with Shane.  I'm now shooting in the 80s from the high 90s & 100s.  Shane's approach to teaching is as simplistic or as technical as the student wants, he gives you as much information as you can handle, provides a short and long term plan for playing better and keeps it fun for the student. If you want to play better golf, the easiest way is to call Shane!
