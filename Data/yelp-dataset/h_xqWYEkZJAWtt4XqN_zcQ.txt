1	My daughter an I both got extreme food poisoning from this location. Most horrible experience ever! First time I've had Dominos in a long time. As Michigan residents I remember when dominos started their franchise. I will be calling the corporate office. Manager seemed to not really care at all or be concerned about checking her food stock. Although she gave a full refund it hardly makes up for feeling like I'm going to die during the past 12 hours and counting. This location gets 0 stars out of 5 stars.
4	fast and tasty...............delivery driver Bryce was a sweet heart!
5	I love ordering from here! Our total is usually around $15 bucks, which is pretty cheap for two people considering it's delivery. Every time we have called in when the site was down the employees have also been nice! Thanks guys!
