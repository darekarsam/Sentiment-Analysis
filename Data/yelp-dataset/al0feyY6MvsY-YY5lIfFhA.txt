5	Not just a catering company but a bakery also!  Love the blondie brownies and chocolate Granny Smith apples!  Can wait to try them out for lunch!
5	The staff is so friendly and helpful and the food is great!!!! They also have a nutrition plan that offers pre made meals...everything u would want in one stop!
4	Really good food. Very nice people. This place has been here forever, but Ed recently bought it. Under the previous owners it reminded me of a bus depot. But now the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. The baked goods are superb, and the food is always consistently good.
5	Very pleasant management and owner. The food was unbelievably good... I've never tasted such a perfect croissant in my life! They also gave me homemade dog treats to give my dog. I'm very impressed and I'll be making this a regular spot from now on.
5	This place is amazing. Great owners and great food I eat here atleast once a week and in never disappointed. Fresh food. The meats are great. It's food you won't find like anywhere else near. Highly recommend.
