5	Very inexpensive place to get custom tshirts made!!! Great service and QUICK turnaround!! There is very limited parking that would only be the downfall :(
5	This is the company responsible for making my guys look good in uniforms. We appreciate your input when it comes to ordering our uniforms.
5	I have been using Thunderbird Trophies for T-shirts, hats, jackets, window stickers, decals, trophies and other business marketing materials for many years. They always do an awesome job at reasonable prices. I highly recommend them.
5	Awesome family owned business for quality trophies, awards, and printed t-shirt at a reasonable price! The owners are friendly and very helpful. If you have questions or need help with picking out stuff, they will show you the best options for your budget. I had ordered some shirts from Thunderbird Trophies for my classmates and I for our graduation. We are very happy with them. The turn around was fast and got done right in time before my graduation week. Thanks Joey and Michelle!
1	Don't bother with this place unless you have a big order that will make them money. I just needed some labels for a growler. I was never called back, emailed, nothing. They completely forgot about me.
