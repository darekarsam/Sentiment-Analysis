5	WOW! What amazing doctors. They do Awesome veneers. My new crown was made in the office and placed on the same day. Beautiful office! They have made me smile and made it beautiful. Thank you Dr. Bryson and Dr. Margio! They gave me the best caring gentle dentistry I have ever experienced.
5	Wonderful Dentists in Summerlin!  They use the most up to date techniques.  They are very welcoming and attentive.  They spend a lot of time with each patient.  The office environment is soothing and relaxing.  The staff is so very friendly and helpful.  Our family recently moved here and are delighted to have found such a great dental practice for all of our basic needs as well as cosmetic services.  We highly recommend.
5	Best dentists in Vegas. The doctors do your cleaning on at least the first visit, not the assistants. Super friendly staff. My family has been to other dentists and no one comes close to comparing. We will never go to anyone but them now. This husband and wife duo is AWESOME!
5	I actually look forward to my visits!!!! No lie!  Amazing staff, very friendly and caring....almost like being at happy hour with friends without the alcohol.  Lol That's my only suggestion... Serve martinis with a cleaning.   My teeth always feel super clean after my visit.  Honest business people.  Best I have ever been to.
5	My husband and I are new to Las Vegas and needed to find a dentist.  I'm happy to say that we found the "needle in the haystack".  They are both very warm and welcoming...the office has "state of the art" equipment...the staff is also very nice.  We are so lucky to have found them.
5	Excellent dental office with both dentists who spend a great deal of time with you on your visits.  This is a caring and kind practice with practitioners who care about the level of care of their work.  Great office, clean, with helpful and kind ancillary personnel.  A fantastic place!
