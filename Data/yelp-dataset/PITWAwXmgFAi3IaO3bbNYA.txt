5	I have had a couple of my firearms cerakoted by PD Warehouse and I couldn't be happier. I'll be taking a few more in as I am very pleased with the work. Although there is not much inventory in the store, they seem to be able to order just about anything you could want that's self defense related. The staff seem very knowleable and are extremely nice to deal with. I wouldn't hesitate recommending them to anyone I know.
5	Bryan and the team at PDWarehouse provide you a one stop shop for all you personel defense needs.  From protective devices, vests and helmets belts clips and custom installation of sites and grips they give the best quality, at a resonable cost.  when it comes to prep your family PDWarehouse is the only place to shop.
5	Honest place could have sold me a more expensive rifle but recommended something cheaper and good quality.
5	I had several of my guns tuned up and brought back to life at PD Warehouse. My favorite Colt we had cerakoted and it looks soooo good now!  The guys know there guns and took great care of me. I highly recommend them for any general work, but especially for custom jobs and "outside-of-the-box" projects.
5	If there is such a person as a personal shopper of defensive weaponry and it's accoutrements,  then Brian at PD Warehouse is the one. From practical advice on type of weapon, support equipment, ammo, refurbishment, training or even type of conceal-carry purse, pack or pouch, Brian Kovacs has the honest understanding of an individual/groups defensive need(s) and give straight forward, practical advice. His prices and custom work are exceptional. I send everyone I know to PD Warehouse.
