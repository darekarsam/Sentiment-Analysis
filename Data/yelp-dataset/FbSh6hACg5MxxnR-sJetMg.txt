1	I would rather walk my parcel to its destination than visit this location ever again. The woman I dealt with (Mary Jo) was horribly rude. She gave me the ultimatum of paying for an extra service that was NOT necessary or taking my box to USPS, which was already closed. If I didn't have to get the box out that day, I would have kindly told her to shove her packing material up her external orifice responsible for defecation.
1	Will only be scheduling pick ups if it means coming to this location. The older lady working there is so rude and not helpful at all.
1	They gave me a quote on the phone that was more than 50% less than when we showed up to send it. MANAGER Lisa was less than helpfull.
1	This review is not about any. FedEx store here in LasVegas but I can't find out how to post one for cross country service.  I ordered some cologne from FragranceNet on Dec.11,2014.  It has gone from New York to all over the US and I still do not have it as of Dec. 27,2014!!!   I tracked this order and it not suppose to get here until the 30th! This was only one small package and it has taken this long.  Beware when you order something over the internet.  Ask how they send it.  I won't be using FedEx in the future.
