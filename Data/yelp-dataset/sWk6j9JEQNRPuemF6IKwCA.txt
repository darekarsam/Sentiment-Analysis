5	I'm sorry what? I never reviewed this one? Weird. Anywho. Five Guys has the best burgers there is and of story. Fries, not so much but they work. The Hot Dogs are pretty nifty. But seriously, it's all about the burgers.... trust me. Big fat greasy cheesy burgers, the way they were meant to be.
3	How can there be only 2 reviews on Yelp for this downtown location?My take is there is a lot of hype, some of it is deserved, but let's not get carried away.What I like is that you can really stuff your burger with as many toppings as you want, even mushrooms and onions, it makes for a real sloppy mess and your burger will never taste the same if you change the toppings. The ground beef is fresh,but under-seasoned, and the bread seems to fall apart due to the liquid toppings. I normally let it drip over the fries, as it adds a nice touchTheir $7 hamburger is actually a double and their $5 small burger is the single patty one, I seem to always get a little bonus with the cook ( a bacon strip or a second meat patty).The fries are also pretty good, but not mind blowing, Belle Province Style but the Cajun spice adds a bit of kick.With a drink, your meal can top the $15 level, while not a deal-breaker, makes me go there less often than I shouldI wish I can give this place 3.5 stars, the concept is good, the free peanuts are appreciated and the service is nice and friendly. The location is amazing as well as being open late.
