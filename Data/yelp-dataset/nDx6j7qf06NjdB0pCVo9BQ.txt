3	First time here. I ate lomo saltado and fried rice. Food was not that bad compared to other Peruvian places. One bad thing was the fact of the manager having to open all exit doors in order to vent out all the cooking smoke. They should have vents to that. As a Latina I understand having the soap operas on but not to the point were the neighbor could hear it.  Service was pleasant overall.
5	Me and some friends went after work and ate a ceviche and it was the best ceviche i ever ate. Truly had an authentic criollo taste. I definitely recommended.  Don Beto knows what he's doing.
5	I had the ceviche and it was very delicious. Will definitely come back to try the other dishes on the menu. Highly recommend this place!
