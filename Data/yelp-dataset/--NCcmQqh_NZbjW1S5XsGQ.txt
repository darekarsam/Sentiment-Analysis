5	Amazing products. Sinfully delicious :) I recommend their cheesecakes.
4	Absolutely fabulous baked goods and they are now offering salads and other yummy items. Definitely a place of drop by for a bite or something to bring home. Hope they get Inter-ac soon. They say they'll be serving outdoors next summer - looking forward to it.
3	So excited to have a cute little bakery in the Hen!! The croissants are delicious. But.... a bit like putting on all your best outfits at the same time, some of the concoctions are a tad overloaded with flavours. Lemon. Poppy seed. Sun dried tomato. I wish there was plainer stuff. Also wish there was gluten free stuff... most bakeries have great wheat free breads now.
5	This place supplies a bunch of Montreal's cafes with their pastries, and there's a good reason why - they're fantastic.My favourite is their chocolate croissant, but the cookies, muffins, and everything else I've tried is great. I haven't yet tried their bread or savoury options, but that's because I just can't stop buying their sweets.The store is on a back-street in St Henri - the kind of location you would never run across by accident, but I guess they cater to a more commercial crowd. That being said, it's a cosy little store, with some table and chairs outside that would be nice in the warmer weather.If you're not from St Henri, are in the neighbourhood, and have a sweet tooth, you MUST come here. If you're from St Henri, you've got no excuse.
