5	4 years ago I did something major to my back and had extreme back pain for about 6 months. I had tried all sorts of things to cure the problem, including physical therapy for about 4 months. I saw Dr. Pappoe for the first time in December of 2007 and he did some tests and educated me about the problem. He then suggested a solution and I followed his recommendations. My back was fine within a couple of months and I haven't had any problems since. Thanks, doc!
5	I'd like to thank the staff and Dr. Pappoe, for the kindness & relaxation I felt during my last visit, March 9, 2012. We shared a few laughs during my appointment (which set my heart at ease), but that didn't take away from the professionalism he and his staff exhibited on my behalf. I know there are several pain management doctors out there to choose from, but I don't hesitate to schedule this procedure with him...at all. Thank you, Dr. Pappoe!
1	I had an epidural by Dr. Pappoe in 2012,and he paralyzed me,I lost my business,my home,and everything that mattered to me! He knew he had done this to me,and didn't seem to care at all!
