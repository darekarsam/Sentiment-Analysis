I don't mind the 'caf' look & feel as it is suited for my purposes. And do Italian places always have to be a restaurant? I do treat my visits here more as a quick snack, for a nice chat over a good coffee or even just to gather my senses. I like it. The staff is efficient and very helpful. The place is clean and the prices reasonable.  So it does exactly what you expect it to do - it serves Italian food that tastes good.

4	Taste of Italy yelp reviewAug 8th 2014 -7:00 pmHad another wonderful meal. Great genuine service. A sweet handsome man stood near my table and made me giggle. So I invited him to sit with me. So nice. The waitresses were great and I felt were looking out for me but I was fine. The chef made me a smashing caesar salad minus the chicken as I requested and gave  me beautiful red peppers instead. Such a great place. Wonderful atmosphere. Love the waiting staff, they seem to genuinely behaving fun. I think most are Italian. Had a grand sicilian waitress and I learned a little about Sicily!Very Continent feeling.  Can't wait to go back. Oh. And great prices too.
