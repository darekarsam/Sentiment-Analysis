4	I love the concept of tapas and it's perfect for someone as indecisive as me whose eyes are bigger than their stomach. No matter what restaurant I go to, it always takes me an age to decide what to go for and the fact that I like pretty much about every food apart from mushrooms it doesn't make the choice any easier. Tapas is brilliant as it means I can try a whole bunch of stuff off the menu rather than just one main. I'm just back from Madrid and there's tapas absolutely everywhere, even in bog standard bars, it's awesome and I'm an even bigger tapas fan now than I was before. La Tasca has an excellent menu and they do an amazing patatas bravas and the two times I've been here the service has been of an excellent standard and the food even better.
4	La Tasca kinda gets a bad name, but I quite like it!! I know more than a few people who slate it because they think it's greasy and not up to scratch, 'Real Spanish food doesn't come in boxes' has been said more than once. So what, it's a franchise, but the food isn't bad!! It's quite a nice way to ease yourself into Mediterranean food if you ask me.Price is good too!! There's always a decent offer on the internet for La Tasca, worth a look.
5	Sublime Spanish Tapas and what a lovely space! Very cozy and inviting. Definitely a highlight of our holiday travels.
2	I find La Tasca to be tapas my numbers - not particularly inspirational.  The one at the Omni Centre is better than the one on Charlotte Square.
4	Great service, quality food, and quick turn around from order to serving!I came in on a Saturday and ordered 7-9 Tapas for 3 people, ample food. My top 3 choices were empanadas, potatoes, y the paella de carne. I suggest staying away from the American type food such as the wings and fried fish. The traditional sangria was a tasty treat!
