4	I try not to eat fast food too often, but JiTB is on the way home so it often sneaks into my life. Have always had good (drive-thru) service here. Stephanie is my girl! Always super nice.
3	I was craving a hamburger...the largest was cheaper than the small one...who cares! I got the small one, after all I can't eat 2 patties in one. For my surprise the beverage included was the 1 liter cup :o!! My measure is 250ml if I'm lucky. This teaches me to just keep ordering the sandwich alone and no combos!
1	Wow!   I will never visit this location again,   The employees were preparing food with bare hands!   They were wiping their foreheads of sweat and then touching food,   Absolutely disgusting!  I reported it to the manager who said they would remake our food,   No Thanks!!!
1	I bought the Bacon Insider here at nighttime after 10:30 PM 4 weeks ago or so.  The burger tasted like someone spit into it and was pretty gross tasting not to mention passing all those germs to people.  I think the manager was in on it because he was laughing his butt off when he handed me the burger in the drive thru.
3	This is fast food. The food is never going to blow anyone away. I appreciate this is walking distance from my house, and open 24 hours. I appreciate kind people taking my order, and consistently getting my order right. I think their soda fountain may need a good cleaning because their soda tastes a little funky. Went there the other night, and ordered 2 medium milkshakes... and had a few good laughs with the cashier. They upgraded us to Large for being kind. Sometimes it's those little things that make you want to come back and eat gross greasy fast food lol
