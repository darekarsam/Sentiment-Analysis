4	Don't know what it is but I've always used Supercuts. Here in Las Vegas I just got to whatever location I happen to be near when there urge to get a haircut strikes.This place was great. No wait. No line. Quick in & out in under 15 minutes. Very friendly ladies and an affordable haircut $13.95 + tip.I will be back in 2 weeks.
4	I frequent here since I live in the area, they are always friendly and the wait is never long.
2	By far the most painful hair cut I've ever gotten with clippers, even worse than navy boot camp haircuts.  The lady who cut my hair didn't care one bit, and I had to point out multiple spots she missed, more than once.  Worst haircut I've ever had, bar none.
