1	Nail tech didn't respond to ouch or pulling my foot away when she stabbed in to my cuticle. She continued the same procedure with every nail. I finally asked her to stop and she gave me a dirty look and started yelling in another language. Whatever, you drew blood. I'm done here. Stay away from the crazy place.
4	I loved my experience here this morning!  The fellow who did my pedi was awesome, kind, and patient.  After my nails were done, I said how much I loved my nails and he gave me a high five!  I would give a five star rating, but the place was a little run down, massage chair had definitely seen better days (but worked fantastic), some nail polish bottles were old and almost empty, and it smelled...well like a nail salon lol.  Overall, I had a great experience.  I had them do a cool design and it only cost $20.00.  Plus after being gone for a half hour I realized I left my wallet there, ran back, and they had saved my wallet for me in a locked display case!  How sweet and honest these guys are. I would recommend this shop all day.
1	I give this place no stars what so ever. Charlie gas no idea what he is doing. I got a whole new nail set today and the nails are in even and the acrylic isn't placed evenly through out my nail... It also isn't even on some of my nails fully. I had to tell him numerous times to be careful using the electric tools because he cut me deep on a few fingers and also wasn't paying attention when he was using tools. He bumped and messed up my nail and when I asked him to fix it he said it would be 5$ extra. My nails and fingers are a mess. The top cost is no good and my nails are full of air bubbles don't go here if you want good nails!
