1	I don't expect much when I go to a McDonald's but it's fast and convenient.  This is the WORST McDonald's experience I've had.I went there for a late lunch today.  There were two people on cash and about five people in line.  Alas, I ended up with the slow stupid girl.The eating area is upstairs.  I got settled into my seat and discovered that my food was cold.  I didn't want to have to head back downstairs and go through it all again with the slow stupid girl so I ate it.  it was nasty :(The counters behind the cash were littered with crap that should have been in the garbage (old coffee packages, etc.).  It's a self-serve pop counter and that was covered in pink sticky juice.
3	This is the slowest McDonalds I've ever been too. I just went in one morning for a couple Egg Mcmuffins and coffee and it took 15 minutes.  I don't know if its a French Canadian thing but they can learn expediency from across the border, and yes I wasn't the only one frustrated it took so long, the locals were not happy either, LOL!
