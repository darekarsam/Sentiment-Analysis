4	Now I am not one to shy away from reviewing an oddball item now and again, so when Stephen K. steps up and beats me to a review of a bridge I have to think I might be slipping.The Matheson Bridge is indeed a gateway of sorts to NoDa.  Like most bridges, you probably pay it little attention - it is a bridge, after all.  To get into NoDa, you simply drive under it, and since it is a fairly standard road overhead, you spend all of a half a second underneath.  Most people probably do not get out in this area of town, so you likely will not stop to look at the art on the columns, but if you do, it might be worth your time - the mural developing will likely never be shown in a museum (who would move an entire bridge?), but it is both unique and historic in its subject, as well as sprucing up the place a bit.Beyond that, you are looking at a bridge, albeit for what is likely bound to be a very short time.  Just remember - other than your monumental bridges like perhaps the Brooklyn or Golden Gate bridges, how many such spans do you know that actually have their own web pages?  And more importantly, those are usually run by the transit authority to tell you about tolls and such.  This one tells you about the art and the soul of the bridge, and important distinction, n'est-ce pas?
5	Though the bridge itself is simply a means of foregoing the need of an intersection on the west side of NoDa, the beautiful mural makes it stand out and a more memorable part of Charlotte's art flavor. Brainchild of local artist Will Puckett, this gorgeous mural tells a wonderful story of Mecklenburg history. There's a brilliant explanation of this at the listed website. Though you may not find yourself walking down North Davidson Street most days, take the time to walk by and take in this gorgeous story/work of art. It's quite remarkable and more memorable up front rather than from your car window.
