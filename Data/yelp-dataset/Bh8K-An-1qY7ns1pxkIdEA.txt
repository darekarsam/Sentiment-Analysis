1	If I could give zero stars I would. This company came recommended to me by my apt complex... I made an appointment TWICE and they didn't show up TWICE. After the first time, they were so apologetic saying this never happens, so I decided to give them another chance - purely off the convenience of not having to call another company and they didn't show up AGAIN. Forget it! Don't waste your time!
4	These guys are quick and do a great job! Chuck is knowledgeable and super cool! Highly recommend.
5	Just had them out here after the holidays.  Had some pet stains and a red stain in one of the kids bedrooms I didn't even know I had.  Daniel and Reese were professional and knowledgeable.  They protected my walls with covers, used the walkways for hoses, moved my furniture for me.  The carpet dried so much faster than I expected and looked brand new!  Thank you so much!  Next time, I'm going to get my tile done!
