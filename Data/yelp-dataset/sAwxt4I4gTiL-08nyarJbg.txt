3	Good service.  Free sufficient size samples and not just a spoonful.  The regular size is more than enough! When I was there, they were out of a lot of flavors though =(
2	Get the White Chocolate but leave the Strawberries and Cream flavor, too faux-berry/chemical tasting.
2	With the world of yogurt and yogurt-like joints popping up, It seems that TCBY has been left behind. It's not bad, per se.. just uninteresting. Staff a this location were sweet.
1	Never have I been so ripped off at a smoothie store than at TCBY Fruithead Smoothies.Unfriendly service, wrong sized order at first, wasn't nearly enough yogurt, too much ice, way too expensive, forgot vitamin boost, horrible bland flavor... this is the worst airport food I've ever had.  Go to a Wendy's and get a Apple Pecan Salad instead.
