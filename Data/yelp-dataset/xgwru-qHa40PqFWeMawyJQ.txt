3	Oh how I wish there was a better library close by.  This place is tiny and the parking lot is horrible!  The closest library to me that has tables you can work at and study at is 30 minutes or more away.  Most of the time, I have to request a book from another library to be sent over because their selection is so small.  Please Goodyear, hurry up and finish building yours!!
5	I've been going there since high school I honestly love this library. it is a small one but you can reserve whatever you need. I think I like the small atmosphere and the fact that i go in and out pretty fast and do not get bothered by a million different people
4	This is not your average"library"! It feels like you're visiting a spectacular gallery somewhere.I would recommend everyone visit this library.The grandness of the architecture is spectacular and it's right in the city, so very easy to get to via the subway or if you're on your way to a nearby site. Best of all, it's free!
4	My partner loves books and wanted to take a look inside the building. We decided to also do the free tour that was at 2pm on the Saturday afternoon. The tour lasts about an hour but you are free to come and go as you choose. I wasnt sure if I would be bored on the tour, but the tour guide made this really interesting. What a beautiful building. Painted ceilings, marble.If I lived here, this is a place I would visit often.
