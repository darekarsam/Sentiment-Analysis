4	I used to come here years ago when I was pregnant with my daughter. Located off 7th Ave and Maryland, I was impressed by the modern decor and equally loved my doctor. I scheduled an appt recently and was glad to see it looked the same. Although the wait can still be too long, after you have been called back, the staff are still great. I was able to get blood work done on-site which was very convenient. It doesn't matter if you are pregnant or not, this place will take good care of you.
4	It is really hard to find a good gynecologist these days. I went to one that wouldn't see me because I was 5 minutes late from being stuck in traffic. This place is clean and has the coolest setup. The front end staff are quick and have the latest technology. When I got back to the exam room, there was a tv that talked about the doctors and the practice. I saw Brittani, one of the nurse midwives, and she was fantastic! She told me that I am the only one that knows my body so she believed everything I was saying. She was very patient with me and gave me medicine that works for my issues. I love this place and recommend it to any woman that needs a good doctor.
3	I come here to see Kim. She's GREAT! She makes me feel very comfortable. She's probably the only reason why I go here though. Yes, everything is up to date, clean, and appealing but the front desk girls usually have an attitude and aren't very welcoming. Also, I usually wait an hour past my appointment to see my gyno. The nurse will call me back on time, takes my weight and blood pressure then has me undress in the room. So I sit there naked and cold on the table for the remainder of the time. Like I said, my doctor is the only reason why I keep coming back. She's absolutely great.
