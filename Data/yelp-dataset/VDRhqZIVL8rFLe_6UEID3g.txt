1	There is no subway at this location, the map is off
1	The owner is rude.  I'm not sure if it stems from his culture, but he is rather abrasive.  He refused for the longest time to participate in the $5 foot longs advertised all the time much less any other promotions.  They also have a refill policy in plain view at checkout instructing employees on how to handle such occurrences.  Two refills and you're done! Lots of exclamation points on the sign too which I find uninviting.Don't bother asking for your mall employee discount or you'll get an earful.
1	Horrible food quality dirty rude uncaring staff and pretty much a sore thumb on an otherwise lackluster food court based on choices of shops...
