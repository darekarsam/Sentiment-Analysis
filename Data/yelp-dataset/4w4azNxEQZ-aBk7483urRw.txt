4	charming resto in the griffintown district. So glad they opened since it is close to home and walkable from the Lowney. We discovered it when we tried to go to Le Local restaurant and it was completely full! They recommended we trythis resto which belongs to the same owner. Indeed, we had a place right at the bar available for us!! Food is good, my "coup de coeur" is the octopus, it SO tender, they marinate it, it is absolutely delicious!!!! Good service and love the bar wall mirror which makes the place look so big! The bar-lounge area is very nice and apart from the main dining room, great!! You guys try it!!
4	Beautiful, clean lines and attractive new Montreal restaurant with excellent food. The only downside would be the VERY CHINTZY drinks. Perhaps I am comparing to the USA but you would never get an ice-filled glass with so little vodka you could hardly see it!!
3	Pas mauvais mais pas non plus extraordinaire. Service un peu "amateur". Bonne musique d'ambiance. Bel endroit.
