3	My Montreal office was located right across the street from this restaurant, so naturally whenever I had business in Montreal, this was our obvious choice to catch a bite during lunch time. Being married to a beautiful Lebanese woman and having grown up among some of the best Lebanese hosts in the world, I am a bit acquainted with their cuisine and enjoy every bit of it. Zawedeh is certainly a place to satisfy a good craving. I have always enjoyed their Tabbouleh quite a bit and the Shish Kebab and Kafta are usually up to par. Wash everything down with a good coffee and a finger licking good desert and you are good to go.
4	Great spot if you're staying near Sofitel Montreal.  Shish Tawouk was great and the fatuoshe salad was great.  Good choice if you want something quick and tasty.
2	went in for dinner tonight on the early side.  Wanted to grab some take out and have a drink.  Wine wasn't great, but the conversation with the bar tender was.  Still, they didn't have falafel (really??).  Got fatoush, kebbeh, and hummus.  Hummus was pretty good, but associate pitas were yesterday's -- stale and fairly nasty.  Fatoush heavily overly dressed with vinaigrette, to the point where it really wasn't edible.  Kebbeh was heavily spiced (almost too much).... Wouldn't recommend this, at least until later in the evening when the food is actually turning over.  No falafel?  Really???
