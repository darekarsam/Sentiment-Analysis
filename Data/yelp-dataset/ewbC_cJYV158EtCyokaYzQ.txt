5	Courteous, helpful and knowledgable about their products. Can sometimes feel a bit pushy about products. Enormous and magnificient collection of hats and scarfs, however small collection of gloves, but all of very good quality. Highly recommended if you are ready for quality. Stay away if not.
4	holy moly, hats galore!this place has hats, men hats. lots of styles, fur hats, etc. if you're looking for baseball caps, you're better off somewhere else. if you're looking for a hat to complete a look or you're a hat lover or simply looking to add some pizazz to your daily attire, it is the place. don't expect the cheap price you'd find at a department store. they do have cheaper hats but quality will suffer while still being a step above department store quality though.i went to grab a homburg the other day. great service albeit a bit pushy. and they'll make sure the hats will fit your head if like me, your head is in between sizes.i'm definitely going back to grab that bowler or maybe that porkpie to make a heisenberg out of myself. now, excuse me while i'm trying to make this homburg work somehow..
