3	Like an Antique Mall without Antiques... or few antiques!  This place has booths to rent for Artists, Crafters or anyone who has something, hopefully something unique!  Most of what I saw I did not like, that does not really mean anything to you unless you have similar preferences!Santa Claus (not the real one, though he could probably be a good stand in) greeted us at the door -  My Girlfriend/Fiancee was scared of him and kept wanting to avoid him... I have always been scared of Jolly S. Nick and good doubles!The layout of the place makes it easy to move around or go in a structured pattern to see everything if you like!Redeemed by the Soft Drink booth!  Pretty Cool Idea!
5	I loved the location in Huntersville and got a bunch of my apartment decor from there. Though this location is rather small I loved it as well. There is a lot of great furniture and and a different type of Items than the other location. I love Blacklion because everything is American made and supports small businesses and artisans. I don't mind spending extra money rather than buying mass produced Chinese things. I ended up buying a couple great scarves and necklaces which the Huntersville location doesn't have. I will be back to see what new items they have soon!
