2	If this place thinks it's a spa, they are wrong. I waited 20 minutes to be asked to sit at a table, then asked to move. My nail tech said all of two words to me while talking to everyone else in a foreign language. There's a sign above the nail polish stating if you break one of their ancient bottles, you'll be paying for it. There's some decrepit lotions in a corner cabinet and a spray tan booth for sale. Yet, they were busy. My nails turned out fine ($15 for a fill) but I won't be back.
1	Went once because it was close to home, definitely not going back. The man who did my nails was rude and said I was no fun because I didn't want wine. Really? I just wanted to have some quiet time and relax!
