5	Bodies By Jill, Owner, Jill Campe Wagner, provides top of the line personal training.  She comes to my home three times a week for an hour session each time. I have just begun my fourth month of training with Jill. I have lost weight, I have already dropped two dress sizes and feel the kind of stamina and strength I was hoping to recover after a while without working out.Jill is always on time,  she confirms appointments two or three days ahead of time, and has credentials and 19 years of experience.Jill meets some of her clients at their gyms as well.   I prefer my workouts at home where I feel focused.She is a walking example of fitness and provides updated nutritional guidance.   She brings workout weights and balls and other accessories for thorough training every hour.I recommend her without hesitation.   She is the sophisticated trainer mature women prefer.
1	Saw her ad on Craigslist and asked one question via email. Good luck with your business because you're going to need it. Couldn't believe the unnecessary rudeness. Lost a possible client.
