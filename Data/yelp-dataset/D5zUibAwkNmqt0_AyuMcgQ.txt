5	World Market is awesome. The prices are great, way better than Pier One, but they have a very similar selection of furniture, knick knacks and other great home decor stuff. I was in there just a few days ago, and they have all kinds of creepiness out for Halloween right now. I love Halloween kitsch, but especially artsy, interesting, culturally diverse Halloween kitsch. I'm going to go all out with my house this year, and it will be largely World Market goodies. I'm stoked.
4	You can really give your house a different vibe with the decor at the World Market.  They carry fair trade crafts, furniture, and many other things: carved masks, coasters, pillows, etc.  They carry products from India, Mexico, Africa, and the Middle East.  I was pretty impressed with the bargains that you can find here as well.  Even when I am not planning on spending any money, I end up spending at least thirty minutes in this store just playing around with all goodies.
4	One of the best places to find a unique gift for someone at a fairly reasonable price, from glassware to snacks and beer/wine to jewelry and furniture.   It is one of my favorite places to pick up holiday ornaments and cards.Pretty much everyone I know has been to a Cost Plus at some point in their lives so I'll spare you the details and just stick with the fact that this location is fairly easy to find but parking could be better with a larger lot.
4	Wonderful wine selection!!!!!
