5	I was in the Phoenix area visiting my brother, who was there for a month training for his new job. We went shopping last Saturday in Scottsdale and wandered into this store. It stood out because of a little sign on the door stating that "only happy people are in this store!" The owner, Mostafa, is a lovely man who will charm you with fun and profound stories about life, family, and his previous job as a tour guide in Iran, where he led tours of palaces for the likes of Elizabeth Taylor and Jackie Kennedy Onassis. (And he has the cool pictures to prove it!) The jewelry and gifts for sale are incredibly gorgeous and well-priced. I just wanted to pick up a few trinkets that day, but I wish I'd bought some of his beautiful jewelry! I know I will stop in again when I am back in AZ, and Mostafa is more than happy to take email orders as well. Thank you sir, for a memorable experience in Scottsdale!
5	I had an amazing shopping experience here! After walking through Old Town Scottsdale this afternoon, all of the started to look the same... and then I stumbled upon Chantelle's Collection and was blown away! The owner was incredibly friendly and dazzled me with story after story of growing up in Iran. He asked me about my hometown and kept me thoroughly entertained while I looked at all the  stunning pieces. That was another thing, the jewelry was all unique and beautiful! Oh! Most importantly - it was marked with the price!!!!! Marked I tell you! I'm pretty sure that's the only spot in all of old town that has actual prices marked. With all that said, I ended up with a handcrafted new necklace, the business card of my new friend, and I will 100% be back if I find myself in these parts again! Chantelle's Collection, tip of my hat to you :)
5	We just adore Mustafo. What a kind, sweet, spiritual man who loves what he does. He sells pieces he believes in and leaves you with a soft heart.
