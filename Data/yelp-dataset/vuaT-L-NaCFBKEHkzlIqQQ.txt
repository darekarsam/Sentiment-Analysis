5	Great experience all around!I remember ordering pizza from this place in a past life and remembered it to be classic Montreal style pizza.When I re-discovered it I noticed they also have Montreal style subs.  Cooked subs with steak, pepperoni, and smoked meat topped with cheese, onions, peppers, tomatoes, lettuce, and dressing.I pushed very hard to make sure we went here on this trip and thankfully my family and travel companions conceded.The pizza is just as good as I remembered it, probably the best in Montreal.  The subs were good as well.  I wasn't blown away by the sub as I have been in the past from other places, but I think I over-hyped it in my head.  They were delicious.I also tried the escargot and Coquilles St. Jacques (gotta love family food sharing) and they were top notch!Not only was the food incredible, but the service was as well.  Our server was super friendly and really enjoyed his job.The menu is very extensive.  You would have a difficult time not finding SOMETHING you like, regardless of how picky you are.Definitely worth the drive to Brossard!
1	My poutine had what looked like ashes in it!! And the manager is extremely rude. Has no customer service skills whatsoever. Service is bad and food mediocre. I will never return here again!
