4	Caffe Espresso is a tiny wee hidden gem tucked away just off the Royal Mile.Serving up some more unusual fillings and toppings for bread based snacks, this family run Italian cafe serve up some really good quality food at a fraction of the price you'd pay just around the corner.There are a couple of seats inside, but you'll soon learn if you stop by that it's not really fit for sitting in. It's simply too small for big hordes of people. But don't let that deter you - if it's a sunny day I would sit outside and have a wee munch on your sandwich there instead. It's definitely worth it - their food is fresh, zesty and full of goodness. They also make a mean latte - cheaper than Starbucks, and more robust!I happened to stop by on a very dreary day, and can honestly say their food and coffee brightened me up! For next time, I'd bare in mind they had some more unusual salad offerings, featuring my favourite - anchovies! Those little fishies don't float everyone's boat but if you haven't tried them, I would strongly recommend it. Plus, it was nice to se a sandwich shop selling more than just a chicken melt panini. Nom, nom.
4	I visited Caffe Espresso regularly when I was living in Edinburgh as a student. Despite currently residing in a gastronomic Mecca, I still have regular cravings for this sandwich shop's Number 9 aka New College Special sandwich. The next time I'm in Edinburgh I will definitely be making a stop here!Its only diminishing feature is its lack of seating which, when the weather permits, is excusable given the option of taking your sandwich to a nearby lawn but everyone who has ever spent any time in Edinburgh will know that this is rarely an option.
