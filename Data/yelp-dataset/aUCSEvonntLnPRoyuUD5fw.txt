4	Cute neighborhood shop with both new and used women's and (some) men's. They seem to have recently refocused on more vintage and second hand clothing and dropped their prices accordingly. They also feature local clothing, jewelry and fashion designers, as well as a bargain basement of fabrics and off season clothing. Only knocking a star for occasionally being a bit overpriced, and inconsistent service-sometimes friendly sometimes not.
