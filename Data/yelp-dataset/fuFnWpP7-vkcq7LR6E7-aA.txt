4	Great staff!
3	This YMCA is tucked away off of Albemarle Rd.  It's easy to miss if you aren't looking for it.Lots of amenities, it always seems like the children that are around the area are enjoying themselves.   There is a pool, and the equipment if fairly new.  It can get busy at peak times, but seems to be normal for a Y branch location.The only complaint I would have is that the parking lot isn't that well lit, and it get's pretty dark.  There is a full-time security guard I always see walking around the parking lot so I suspect there have been a couple of car break ins at this Y location.
3	This YMCA is very easily missed if you do not have a GPS system.  It is tucked away from eyesight off of Albemarle Road.  The parking lot is very awkward and uneven to me.  This area has a lot of involvement with children from what i have noticed on my regular visits.  The weight room is small but it has a lot of free weights to use if your use to lifting weights.
5	Amazing Cardio Funk classes with Q!!!
5	I have been attending this YMCA for the past 8wks and lost 11lbs thus far.  The Staff are friendly and personable and so is everyone who attends.  This place is "Family".  You feel it!  The classes are awesome and vibrant, especially Cardio Funk with Quentin Bolden, Zumba, and Spin.  These are the classes I have taken.  I've also taken a Senior Cardio Lite class and they had more endurance than me!? The pool is great and warm and the deep end is at the end and not in the middle as the University.  As with all YMCA's, there are signs, just follow them or call for directions. This is not withstanding a lesser star.
