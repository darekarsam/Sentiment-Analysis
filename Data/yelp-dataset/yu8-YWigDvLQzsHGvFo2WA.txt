5	My partner and I had an absolutely AMAZING experience with the paint and wine party hosted by Sarah. She was warm and kind when we walked into her studio. Which is an extension of her actual residence. Its a beautiful room with big windows and doors for lighting. Her instructions were easy to follow and we were able to move at our own pace. Plus she encourages creativity and individuality. (awesome since it is art!)She was very flexible with me on timing and even let us get an extra bottle of wine to go along with the yummy snacks like cheese, fruit, and crackers!!  This experience was no pressure or awkwardness just pure fun!! Ive already recommended her to friends and we will definitely be back to paint on a regular basis. WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!!!!!
5	I love Sarah! She is just so fun to be around with and learn new things. Although I only took 3 classes with her, I'm definitely glad I did because it was a new environment and just a way to get away from home. She helped me with acrylics and watercolor. It was real fun! I highly HIGHLY recommend her if you want to learn more about painting and esp to have someone real fun to talk to! ^_^
