5	One of my favorite and most memorable trail runs. Very steep but relatively short climb to the top (I believe less than a mile). Very rocky and surrounded by some nice flat trails around the hill. If this were closer it would be in my weekly routine. Very strenuous. Great views of the city.
5	Well, this little hike is good for beginners. It was my first time today. I was expecting a little intense hike but it was ok. It probably took us (my kids and me) 20 min to get up there, then hanged out for a little bit. It's was good light cardio. I'll come here again since it's only couple miles from my house.
5	Fun little hike coming in at .75 miles up and down. Watch out for snakes though. I highly recommend the hike as it only takes about 20 minutes to complete.
