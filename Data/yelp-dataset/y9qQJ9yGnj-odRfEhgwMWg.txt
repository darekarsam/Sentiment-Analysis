4	This is definitely the place to go for pretzels!
4	Il est chaud! Il est frais!With a motto like that, how could I say no? Plus the aroma of the pretzels was calling my name as I tried to pass by, leading me to turn around and purchase a hot and fresh sesame pretzel.For $2, it was the perfect afternoon snack. It was crispy on the outside, toothsome in the middle, covered with toasted sesame seeds, and much tastier than their New York counterparts! I didn't even need mustard!
