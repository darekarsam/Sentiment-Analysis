4	The shirts we had printed turned out very nicely.  They were much more prompt than I was in the whole process.  Their prices were very reasonable and the service was friendly, with many fail-safes to make sure your t-shirts were exactly what you wanted.  Very low effort on my part to ensure good product quality, which is good because I don't have much time to spend on these types of things.  They are slightly slow to respond to mail (next day, instead of day of), so that's a slight ding if you are in a hurry.
5	The shirts I ordered were perfect. The process of ordering, designing and paying were simple. The representative was very helpful in designing and his recommendations were perfect. If I were to order another set of shirts, I would definitely come here.
5	I have ordered several different types of apparel here (various screen-printed t-shirts, sweatshirts, sweatpants, embroidered jackets) as well as have been assisted with promotional items for the organizations I am involved in. UGP is very up to date in their website's design lab/quick quote tool & have great online approval/payment processes. Several fail-safes and quality assurance steps were taken to make sure our orders were perfect. Cameron who works here was exceptionally helpful and communicative. Overall I have been pleased with every order's design outcome and speedy turnaround time.
5	The product was great! We went with the less expensive, cotton Gilden shirt and it was perfect. We worked with Cameron who was super attentive and helpful. When we needed to change our order he went above and beyond to help our group. I would definitely go back. The shirts are great and the customer service is amazing as well!
