5	They had everything for my intercooler. Tbolt clamps, hose, fittings. Great customer service too!
4	Expensive stuff , but topnotch stuff. Very knowledgeable with anything to do with hose, super helpful employees.  Only downside is this place can be busy and if your in a rush you might have to wait. Best hose supply store in Vegas!
