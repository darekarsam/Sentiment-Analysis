2	I just don't understand why this place is still in business.  I wouldn't think that this part of town was so desperate for a Chinese Buffet that it would keep frequenting the place.  I just don't know....  Rent must be really really low.Buffet size was fine, though with all their space you might have thought that they would have done more. Tons of seating - and I know I've driven past it when it looked packed.  Which is why we gave it a try.What's the word for barely fine?  Ok, but not quite that good.  Passable?  I think that would be it, yet it almost sounds too positive.  The food was passably ok.  I think I just made up a word, but it will work.You won't get sick, and you might find some things to pick at.
1	This place is awful!  Upon entry, the cashier tried to cheat me, wanting the dinner price when it was nowhere near the dinner time posted on the wall.  She finally let me in at the posted price.  The couple who came in after me & sat near my table argued the whole time I was there, because she had allowed the cashier to cheat them & the guy was having a fit about it!There wasn't a bit of service available, nor a drop of regular water to drink, as soda water came out of both "water" taps on the soda fountain.  Avoid this place at all costs!If you're hungry for something right now, go around the other side of the building to King Wah Buffet.  It's pretty bad (* *), but it's worlds above this place.  Better yet, drive 3 miles west to Jumbo Buffet (* * * *) at 3414 W. Southern, & enjoy a good meal!
3	= = = = = = MUCH IMPROVED! = = = = = =Now that the infamous King Wah Buffet around behind this building has finally folded, I decided to get my nerve up to give this formerly 1-Star place another try.  It's been 27 months, even though this is the closest buffet to the house, of all the two hundred & some I dine at & review here in AZ!  That's how bad the experience was back then.  (See original review.)     :-OThis time, things were MUCH BETTER!     :-))Here are some notes from today's visit:POSITIVES:*  Friendly, appreciative host & hostess!*  Low lunch prices of $6.45/$5.80 Sr. including help-yourself beverage!*  Lots of drinks to choose from, including sodas, coffee, Horchata, & Jamaican Fruit Punch!*  Good-sized selection of 64 food choices, plus sauces & dressings.*  Excellent Hot & Sour Soup, with lots of goodies in it, including meat!     :-)*  Trays kept properly stocked & stirred.*  Fruit in heavy cream (variation on Ambrosia Salad?)  5 Stars!*  Rich, tasty soft-serve ice cream..Ok, just a few NEGATIVES:*  Tables & chairs only, no booths.*  2 TVs (but not loud where I was sitting).*  Some food items greasy.SO, everything is ok now.  The food is pretty good overall, & it's certainly worth the low prices.  Business was fairly brisk at lunchtime today, & the lovely folks running this big place deserve to have YOU come give it a try now too!     :-)
4	Good food Low pricesNot a fancy restaurant,  but ok for a buffet
2	I had lunch here with Rand H and I found all the food here to be good to real good. They had these little breaded pork riblets that were awesome. The price was under  7 dollars including drink and I left with a full belly.This place could get more stars if they just took care of it better. there is a stink in the place that seems to be coming from the dirty carpet (replace carpet) Graffiti all over bathroom walls (paint them) These problems are so obvious why are they not addressed. If you are going to own a restaurant one would think you would have pride in it. Or maybe look for a career in something not customer service related.
3	This place runs hot and cold. Some days the food is awesome, others its meh. Price isn't bad. Place could use renovation and someone dedicated to picking up the used dishes more often.
1	If your expectations aren't terribly highly then you won't be too disappointed. I was going to say standard cheap buffet and give two stars, but when I got to the tray of fried chicken wings, complete with a few fried feathers, I decided to drop down to one star.  I don't think there is a repeat in my future.
