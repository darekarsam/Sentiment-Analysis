3	going out to Newhaven to visit a friend we went to a few pubs then got a Javit's as a takeaway on the way back. There is nothing to say that will make you go there, or any specific reason to stay away. It does, fairly well, what every other kebab shop / chippy / pizzeria does.The food is perfectly average, with a good range of pizzas. The ingredients are alright but nothing special. You can also get the bog standard range of fried stuff - sausage / burgers / fish etc. The prices are pretty cheap but that's about it. Unless you're in the area don't really bother with it
