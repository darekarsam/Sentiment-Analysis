4	Driven past this place hundreds of times from the way home and finally cracked one night craving one of the new Cool Ranch Doritos tacos.  I took advantage of the 24 hour drive thru and the employee was very friendly (although he kept calling me "boss").Food came out quickly and we were on our way in under a couple on minutes.  Once home the tacos were AMAZING (seriously whoever thought about making a Doritos into a shell is a game-changer!).  On the minus side I ordered a triangle cookie like dessert with frosting in the middle.  It's prepackaged and wasn't that good, hopefully they still have cinnomin twists, because thats what I'll get next time!
3	A friend & I went through the drive-thru & ordered the Baja Mountain Dew freeze. Usually they will fill it up all the way, but this employee didn't and when my friend asked about it he got all defensive $ basically said, "Idk what Taco Bell you went to, but they're wrong we don't fill it up like that". & well you see here sir, we've been going to this one & they always filled it up to atleast fill the slurpee lid. Why would you give us slurpee lids if you're not going to fill it up? That's why they're shaped that way for a reason or else he should've just given us a flat lid. Geez. & then he opened our straws & put it in our drinks & mine had a hole in it. I don't know where your hands have been. Oh Taco Bell. I'm just gonna go to the one on Warm Springs.
2	I thought if I go inside and order in person it would prevent mistakes. I was wrong they ordered 3 extra things that I never said I wanted that were expensive. I didn't think The total sounded right but wasn't sure until I got home. Unreal!
