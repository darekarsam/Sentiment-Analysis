3	Small little club, with limited snacks and beverages.  But quiet and cooler than the rest of the airport.  Since AMEX Platinum no longer provides AAdmrials Club Membership, this is the next (although a bit of a walk) best thing.
3	Limited hours, a bit dated, and no showers, but they have Campari. Mmm... Campari.  I suppose there are worse places to wait for your flight.
4	Solid little lounge at Terminal 4 (gates B20s or so) at PHX airport. Location's a tad weird - you have to take a bunch of stairs or an elevator to enter, so follow the signs!Snack selection is limited, but by no means bad - Miss Vickies, Smartfood, Baked Lays, etc. chips, tasty mini muffins in various flavors & fresh apples and bananas. If there were real food (I hear there is real food after 3:30 pm for the BA members, but I wouldn't have access to that) this would be a 5 star USA airport lounge.The liquor selection - all complimentary - is above standard for a lounge like this. They offer several beer and wine selections, as well as a full bar for cocktails (Smirnoff/Absolut level hard liquor). My bloody mary was great!The service is fantastic - Glenn (I think that's his name!) was a great bartender and overall service provider, as were the people checking in. The internet is pretty quick and the club is kept at a very comfortable temperature.I wouldn't recommend paying for this lounge ($35 passes are a little steep for what you get), but if you have Priority Pass or Lounge Club cards it's definitely worth a visit.
