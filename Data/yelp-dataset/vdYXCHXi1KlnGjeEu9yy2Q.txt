3	The strippers here are pretty friendly as far as strippers go, and it is a fun place to go on rare celebrations with buddies.  Most places like this are filled with dirty drunks, but this place is mostly younger people just looking to have fun.  I would stay at home if you are under twenty-one, because instead of just marking your hands, they require you to wear an embarrassing bright pink shirt and there is a thirty dollar cover.  Don't go blowing your money on girls, but it is fun to visit once in a blue moon.
3	This is a nice, low-key strip club.  The dances are cheap and the girls seem to understand that they have to work for their money.  The only downside is that there are a lot of average looking girls here who aren't as attractive as the girls at a lot of other clubs that I've been to.There was a dancer I met here a couple of months ago who blew my mind with her private dance.  Unfortunately she has left the club from what I understand but I would have proposed to that girl in a second.  LOL.
3	I've been to a few strip clubs and this one is ugh... okay I guess. The girls are really friendly though but are average looking and average dancers. One of the girls played pool with me for an hour or two and talked lol. It is cheap though which is always a plus. I believe $25 for a private dance and $10 for a table dance. My friend and I went there to watch the Heighsman and my friends dude won (Jameis Winston) and he celebrated by getting us a private dance lol. I'd say if you wanna have a fun night bring $55 a person. Also its free before 9 p.m. to get in I think!
