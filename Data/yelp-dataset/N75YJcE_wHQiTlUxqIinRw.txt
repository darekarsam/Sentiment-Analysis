3	I love strolling through this shop even if it is super small- and that's my main beef with it. The greeting cards are great but the selection is often slim and it doesn't seem like there's a lot of commitment to keeping it up (check out the "great cosmic happy ass" cards). There's pretty much a small selection of whatever they carry but the point is is that it's cozy and interesting. There's a place in the back for readings- and though private from sight, anyone on the other side of the wall can hear about your north node, unless the tone is hushed enough. There's a $1 bill framed on the wall from Rupert of Survivor fame. Candles, CDs, books, assorted decks, incense, bumper stickers and gemstones- all here.Update: They have "Meet & Greets" on Fridays. Excellent for newbies to the Charlotte area trying to find like-minded folk or for the seasoned Charlottean needing some fresh faces.

For those with more vanilla tastes it might not seem like there's much going on, but for those who know what they are looking for it is a treasure trove.Their lack of books and cards is totally redeemed by their abundance of oils (both essential and premixed), incense, and herbs.  Speaking of herbs, the owner told me that soon they will be expanding their herb selection and the amounts they carry due to the high demand.  Plus this place even has some supplies I've never seen a store carry.  Like hard to find stuff that you can't even find on the Internet sometimes.  Which is kind of a relief since I don't think anyone really wants to venture out to get it  themselves.
