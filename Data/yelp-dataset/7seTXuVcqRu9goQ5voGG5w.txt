5	Just moved here and picked her name out of my insurance providers book. The Woman's Care group is located on the 3rd floor of the Pres. hosptial. Dr. Meek is great! She is one of the dr.'s in the practice and makes an unplesant experience go by quickly. However, she did not make you feel rushed and had time to answer all of my questions.
5	I 2nd that 1st-5 star review wholeheartedly for Dr. Meek Now that Dr Meek has moved to another practice, Dr. Sal is awesome! She's very personable. I find her to be refreshingly honest and able to fully listen and patiently answer questions. Still a 5-star rating here!
5	went here by recommendation of my dearest friend on 13 years. I needed a 2nd opinion and i got exactly what I needed. I will be having surgery soon and will continue my review then.for now Dr. craddock was very caring, listened to me. asked appropriate questions and took everything I said into consideration. update to come soon
5	Went here on a referral.  Dr Sal is AMAZING.  Who likes a pap?  But I think Im especially sensitive/ squirmish/ and prone to have an absolute meltdown.  Dr Sal is quick, gentle, compassionate, and is willing to spend time getting to know not only your medical history but you personally.  Matthews is far for me but worth it.  Ill follow Dr Sal wherever she goes. In addition the hospital is clean an beautiful.
