5	I Love Vegas Royalty because I buy anything that has crowns on it. I love anything that is black and sparkly. I am a fan of Vegas Royalty. I also love the name. I am going back to that store the next time I am in Vegas.
1	The one star is for the Vegas Royalty in the Mandalay Place Shops between the Lu xor and Mandalay Bay. How rude can you treat a customer when she comes in! I looked at all the shirt and then i always go too the sale rack to see if anything cute. i saw a shirt I like and it was in a Medium; so I ask the sale gal if they had it in a large in the back and brought me something completely different and told me that big girls like me should not shop here or ask for a proper size like XL. How upset I got...I threw the clothes on the floor and left. I am not a plus size girl not am I a skinny girl. I wear a Large and worked very hard to shed pounds to get too that point. (went from a size 22 to a 12) from now on I will only shop at the Miracle miles Vegas Royalty shop; I always get great treatment there!
4	I received an apology letter from the owner of the company. They were appalled at the treatment I received and planed on taking action on this particular employee. I wasn't the only one that this happen too; my complaint was the final straw! I appreciate the concern for there customers and  feelings. It made me feel good to get a sincerely heart felt apology and would do anything to get my business back. I will not return to the shop in Mandalay Place but will continue my business with Vegas Royalty in Miracle Miles Shops.
4	This place has the best, tackiest, party clothes. I bought a tattoo shirt to wear for Halloween and it was only $40. Other places on the  Strip were charging $200+ The staff is helpful and friendly. The managers are willing to deal and will mix and match sales, anything to make a buck!
