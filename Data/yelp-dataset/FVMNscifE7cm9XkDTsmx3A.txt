4	This is the newest McDonald's in North Las Vegas, and possibly the Vegas Valley. In similar fashion to newly opened businesses, this one starts out on a clean slate.   The atmosphere is upbeat because everything is brand new and clean. With the newness, there is some neat features. The one that stands out is a screen similar to the DMV that flashes your order number when it is ready. In similar fashion to new and remodeled McDonald's, there is a McCafe and indoor playground..  The employees appear cheerful. The service was fast and friendly.  I am a fan of new businesses. Especially new McDonald's that are upbeat restaurants. I bestow the newest North Las Vegas McDonald's with 4-stars.
3	This McDonald's gets bonus points for its newness factor.  There's also a playground for the kiddos. It seems like it's busy most of the time, but the employees sure try their best to crank out orders as fast as possible.  Another plus- the employees actually smile and are friendly!  The restaurant area is clean and thus far all my orders have been correct.  This is probably my favorite McDonald's location.

1	The first few months it was open I would have reviewed this place a five but now they are hiring the biggest retards (Michelle). My wife recently came thru the drivethru to order ice cream and was treated with the upmost disrespect. The attitudes, eye rolling and smirks makes this unprofessional team just a place I will not spend a dine on. From nice folks to GHETTO attitudes was something I hoping this site would not hire but they did. Absolutely stay away from this place and I hope this McDonald's just close outright.
