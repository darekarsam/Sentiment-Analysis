4	Went to this location this morning to deposit a check.  The guy in front of me was flirting with the teller, Stella.  He was so loud and obnoxious, I could overhear his lame game.  When I got up to the window, I could see a big rock on Stella's ring finger as well as a look of "thank God that clown left" on her face.  What a waste of time for that dude.Anyway, the service here was good.  Stella was quick and efficient and I was on my way within a couple of minutes.Will I return?  Sure.
5	Was back in town for a weekend and went to the bank to make a deposit.  To my surprise, this location is Open Sunday!  Wow, I lived nearby for over 4 yrs and never knew that!  Good stuff.Return Factor - 100%
4	What you should know:It is inside Albertson's just inside the east entranceIt is open every day of the weekIt is pretty crowded as in tight spaces.It has 2 ATM machinesIt had 2 pens on chains, but someone keeps taking one of themIt is not a full service branch (vault/safe related services are not available)Last time I was there, not just to use ATMs, Camille was the Branch Manager and she was very helpful & nice about reversing fees. If you are depositing lots of coins, they need to be rolled; they will provide the roll sleeves (Whatever they're called.  I always think of them as Chinese Finger Traps).
1	There is always a line and there are many people behind the counter and only one or two taking care of the people in line.  Come on man!!!!
