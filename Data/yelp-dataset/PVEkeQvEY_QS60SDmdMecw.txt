3	Was craving an Old Fashioned donut and coffee so stopped in for a moment.  Cashier was very nice and the store was quite clean.  Donuts don't taste as good as I remember but they may be because I have a biased memory of them.  Coffee was great.
2	Service was good but definitely don't order a bagel especially if you are used to having one at City Deli or Bruegger's.  Ice Cream was yummy.
3	I [heart] Dunkin' Donuts Coffee.  I'm sure the love may fade, but the coffee has really hit the spot for me in the past couple of weeks.The only other thing I've tried at this location is the icecream and with Baskin Robbin's 31 flavors, you can't really go wrong.This location is a bit tucked away from Independence and is really catered toward the drive thru.  Make sure if you are walking into this place you look right and left so that you don't get flattened by drivers that haven't had their coffee yet.
4	This location is a bit difficult to get in and out of, but if you are heading uptown from Matthews, it makes for a quick stop for some coffee and some Munchkins (the small donuts, not the Lollipop Guild).The ice cream is no longer here - this is just donuts and coffee now... and K-cups for those with a Keurig and a design for DD coffees.  According to my mother, they got rid of the Baskin Robbins portion and turned that into a nice seating area with a cushy sofa and some chairs. June's (2014) flavor of the month was Blueberry Cobbler, which my mom was in need of, so we stopped on a weekday for some coffee and donuts.  She ooh'ed and aah'ed over her fresh tasty donut and her iced coffee.  I got a box of Munchkins and an iced coffee, which were all tasty.  It was an average DD, so really a 3-star, but the young man that assisted us was VERY helpful and extremely friendly.  If in the area again, I would definitely return.
