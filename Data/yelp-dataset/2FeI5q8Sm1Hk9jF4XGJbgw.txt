4	Hongfu offers an excellent range of dishes in no-nonsense surroundings. Portions are generous, dishes are well-executed, with the Mongolian beef, and mountain chicken proving particular favourites, with our party.Overall, we think Hongfu has solid claims on being one of the best restaurants of its type in Edinburgh.
4	We have been to this noodlebar several times now and  we are very pleased with the dishes, service and the atmosphere. They are very well located on Waterloo Place overlooking the Balmoral Hotel, Waverley Station, Princes Street Gardens and the War Monument. A window seat is recommended!I am used to hot and spicey foods, I normally would request additinal spices / chili / pepper - what I didn't have to do here! My favourite starter dish is found here : Edamame!  I recommend their chef's special (beef in garlic & chili sauce)  and the dumplings - on request you can get normal cutlery, but authenticity requires chopstick. When we visit the place is always frequented by asian people and that is an recommendation in itself. There is a space in the back with big round tables and I noticed on one occaision they had a group of about 30 people in - so I'd gather from that they do groups as well.- good for a night out or a quick bite.
