3	Can't ever have enough pretzels!!!! Small location but super nice customer service. The people are really friendly and attentive. They were giving samples and there was a line out the door. That fresh lemonade was refreshing on this cloudy day!!! :)
4	LOVE PRETZELS!  We got the bitz and shared with cheese sauce.  Inhaled all the bite size, soft, and chewy pretzels bites.  YUM.  Had the bubble gum slush to wash down the heavenly pretzel bits.Staff is friendly and super helpful.
4	On vacation, we decided to grab a pretzel at the Tanger Outlet mall.  THEY WERE DELICIOUS.   If you've had Auntie Anne's pretzels, these are above and beyond that.   We got the original pretzels salted and each got a cheddar cheese dip.   Boring, but delicious!
