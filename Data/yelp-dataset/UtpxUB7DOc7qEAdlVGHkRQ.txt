5	awesome staff samatha and desiree are great. They are very helpful and since they have great customer service I'm really considering to move here. the only thing I dont like about the place is the living room for the 2bed 2 bath apartments it feel really small and the bed rooms are slanted but everything else about the place is great. Im debating between this place and avanti. My husband and I most likely will move here because samatha is too awesome and she made us feel really comfortable.
4	I have lived at the Willows for over a year now and was waiting until I had been here for some time before writing a review. I am really happy with the decision to live here as the price for the size of apartment I have is a lot better then where I have previously lived. The staff is always friendly and my wife will sit in the office and chit chat with them regularly. Maintenance has always been quick to come out and fix any problems there are with the apartment. The other residents here are really good about not being excessively loud and  disturbing. I have never had anyone park in my assigned spot so that has never been an issue. When I run into someone around the parking lot they are always friendly and nice. I'm happy to be renewing my lease here and living here for another year.
5	I have lived here for just over 5 years now and love it. Samantha and Desiree are very friendly,  as is all the staff.  The grounds are well kept and any maintenance issues are handled almost immediately, if not immediately! It is very quiet here and my neighbors are friendly. I live in a 2 bedroom,  downstairs apartment with an attached 2 car garage. Very comfortable and convenient!
