4	Food: Pretty good. Not to greasy. Price: Reasonable. The lunch combo are a deal.
3	Stopped here for the first time tonight. The store is a small corner store with three or four tables. You can watch the three cooks cooking your meal. I ordered their chicken chow mein to go. The vegetables were crisp and the flavor good. I will come back.
5	Great food unlike it china fun counterpart across the street this is the place that you will find crispy chicken that not overloaded on sauce and they have the best crab Rangoon
4	I'm relatively new to the Charlotte area. I have been living in NYC the past ten years and I had an urge for Chinese food. This place is very close to a NYC Chinese food experience... but much cleaner. Lol. My General Tso chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy inside. The sauce was good, but I'll have to remember to ask them to spice mine up a bit. Decent prices also.
2	My boyfriend called for delivery we didn't know exactly what we wanted, so we were kind slow and hesitant,  but the lady had an attitude on the phone ,  .. She said 45 min to an hour every time i call for dilivery its never that long... And then she ask if their was a problem which confuses me.... the food is amazing though.I  never had a problem with chin chin before until now, I don't like rude employees especially at a restaurant cause who knows whats happening to our food.
4	Great food. It's a bit pricey though. They take a long time to make your food but its worth it.
2	The crab rangoons are awesome! The rest was mediocre. The eggrolls were ok. The rice was plain, edible with soy sauce. The general tso's chicken was bland, not sweet, just spicy and a bit soggy. They did say it would take 40 mins for delivery an dit only took 20, so that was nice. But overall I won't be getting food here again.
