5	Helpful, always has prescriptions ready to go!
5	The 5 star rating is mostly for the pharmacy staff. They take really good care of you. I've been having my prescriptions filled here for the past 3.5-4 years and the staff treated me like a good friend from day 1. We've gotten to know each other pretty well over the years and have a lot of fun when I pop in for a pick up or drop off. They have no problem offering up recommendations on OTC meds or advice on what to try if you're not well but not quite at the point of going to the doctor. They keep a pretty good eye out for possible drug interactions or let you know if there is a really common side effect to watch for and what to do to alleviate it. A lot of pharmacy/shops to me are stores with a drug counter in the back. This location is a pharmacy that has a shop in front. Sometimes I'll grab some on-sale or holiday candy for a quick snack. Their rewards program can be beneficial, even if you don't spend a lot there (my brother-in-law has had platinum status for over a year now, I've barely made a dent in the first tier). Even if you don't spend enough to get the extra 10% off, you still get discounts and sometimes coupons. Rite Aid also has a handy app you can use to refill your prescriptions by either scanning in the bar code on the prescription or from your prescription history. It's a lot more convenient than tracking down prescription numbers. Back to this specific location, if you're looking for a pharmacy staff that will care about you as a person and not just a customer, this is the place to go.
3	Honestly one of the pharmacists here creeped me out and tried to make too many jokes and conversation and once looked at what I was doing on my phone. They also quit carrying my Rx, but offered something similar, so I quit filling refills here and switched to WalMart. Mostly cause of the guy. Haha. But no reason to avoid this Rite Aid.
