5	You can't beat these prices! 2.50 for one piece?!?! The staff is so nice and really cares about customer satisfaction! I am always greeted with a big hello and warm smiles.  My clothes always come out looking great. All my clothes, expensive or not come out looking AMAZING! I've recommended all my friends to this place!! The place is clean and tidy and family friendly!!
5	I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!! The front lady thats there until 3 is so funny and sweet! You don't find great customer service like that! The prices are amazing and you get your clothes the NEXT DAY. Cleaning is great and the shop is tidy! More cleaners need to take tips from this place! Feels like home (;
