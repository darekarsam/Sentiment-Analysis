4	$7 haircuts right now, hard to beat. I have had the same guy cutting my hair for the past eight years, but when he is not available I come here. Always quick, always friendly, and always a good cut. You girls are doing a great job!
4	I have been here twice and both times were later at night. I come here expecting to get my hair cut in a reasonable manner, this is not, nor is it intended to be a high end salon. That said, they have adequately delivered on each of my hair cuts. As with most places, they input your preferences so you don't have to remember what you got last time and I have never had to wait. I have had two different gals cut my hair and each has been more than pleasant. I pay $12 for the hair cut plus tip so it's not going to be any cheaper elsewhere. One of these days I'll grow out my hair and then go into a trendy hair salon for that much coveted Justin Bieber Jr. hair cut, but until then, this place is fine.
5	I normally go to the barber shop where the old timers cut your hair so when my dad, who moved here last summer, suggested Great Clips, I was a little doubtful. I walk in and there was a line almost out the door. The gentleman at the counter was told 35 min for the wait. Right when he sat down he was called up for a cut. That helped my doubt diminish. I put my name in, sit down, get half way through a hand of solitaire on my phone, and was called up. Genna cut my hair. I showed her photo on my phone of what I was looking to get. We had a quick discussion about it and she got to work. All I have to say at this point is, she was awesome and friendly, did an amazing job with my hair, and when ever I need a hair cut and I'm in the area, I will go straight to the crew at Great Clips.Good prices, good environment, friendly and talented staff, and a fun time.
