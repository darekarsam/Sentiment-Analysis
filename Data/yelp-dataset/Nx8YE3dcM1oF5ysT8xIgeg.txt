4	Go here for lunch quite often. Truth is there isn't much around.  The food (vietnamese influenced) is tasty, and the portions are reasonable.  It is also very reasonable.  BYOB.  Moreover, prices are very reasonable and service is quick most of the time, which is important for lunch.  Not haute gastronomy but for the price it deserves a 4 stars
4	Good Price. Good food. Quick service. Bring your own wine
