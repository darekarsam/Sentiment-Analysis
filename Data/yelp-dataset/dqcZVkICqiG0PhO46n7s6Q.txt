5	This place is cool. Way too cool for me. The owner of the business is super friendly and very knowledgeable. The selection of vintage clothing and vintage accessories is pretty good. They have a great selection of vintage and rare band Ts. I didn't have enough time to check everything out, but I will be back.
5	Awesome selection that gets bigger and bigger!  Even if your not a "rock star"  this place is for you. Probably the nicest staff of any retail shop in the whole Valley and they live the life.  Diffently not a waste of time to check in here and see what's new.
1	I've been following them on FB for awhile, I got excited seeing all the vintage concert tshirts and decided to make the trip downtown.Yeah.........$140 for a t-shirt......A T-SHIRT?Did the people in the bands actually wear them at some point?I was really hoping for a cooler selection of jeans too, but hey, what can you do?Nice helpful staff, but way out of my price range for clothes.
