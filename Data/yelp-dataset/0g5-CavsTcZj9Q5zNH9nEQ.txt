1	110 outside and no AC for a 30 minute plus wait!  Terrible customer amenities
5	Dropped the car off to get an oil change and just have things looked at. It only took them an hour and half. Considering I just dropped in on them I thought that was pretty solid.Jesus and Gustavo were quick to help me as soon as I showed up.I ended up getting a new air filter and cabin air filter for an additional charge. Tommy hooked me up with a solid deal. Thank you sir!Great hard working guys gettin the job done quickly an efficiently in this ungodly heat. I appreciate the work and I'll be back to this location with any issues or questions I run into.~TheWaterGuy
2	$100 for an oil change. 45m wait. Is this for real. Not impressed. Super crappy waiting area.
5	Not a problem to report. I'm happy. Got a $5 discount since I called first and mentioned that when I arrived. Also got a discount on a filter and a mail in rebate for the oil chance. Top offs between oil changes is cool. Vacuumed my floors. They were all professional and polite and quick on their feet. I'd go back.
