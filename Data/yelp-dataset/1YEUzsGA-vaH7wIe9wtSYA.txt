3	Not my favorite Cycle Gear store - the selection is not as great as the one on the Cave Creek but ultimately they had what I was looking for - so who am I to complain?!
5	I am a new rider and this shop helped me get geared up and I have been back four times and I have yet to find anything negative with the shop.
