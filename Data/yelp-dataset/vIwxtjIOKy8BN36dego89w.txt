4	A magnificent building on the outside and enthralling plays on the inside, this is a great theatre to come to for a night out.  It's a fairly small theatre so its atmosphere is more involving and brings you closer to the heart of the play on offer.As a theatre it offers more than many of your corporate theatres including amateur theatre groups.  These are my favourite of all theatre productions and what I believe real theatre is all about.  It's not quite grass roots and these productions are very good, but still raw and exciting.It is worth a visit and will offer a good night out, but also offers a variety of classes over time.  Finding out when these are on can be a bit of a struggle, but checking the boards outside every now and then should keep you updated with what is going on.

But I went to Church Hill Theatre to see a friend of a friend in a production of Hair. You know Hair, the infamous hippie musical from the 70s. It's hilarious and worth a watch. The production itself was really fun. But as far as the theatre goes, it stands also on its own. It's really gorgeous on the outside, and equally gorgeous on the inside. The lighting and all was done really well, which I tend to think is creditable to the Theatre itself, as well as the people who work on the lighting. The sound was good, too, so kudos to both the sound engineers and the space itself.If you ever find anything going on there, definitely go. It'll be worth it.
