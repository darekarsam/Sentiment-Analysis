4	I went to the Coffee Cup before it moved, the building was old, the sevice was indifferent, but it had charm.  The new restaurant in NODA  is in a very cool space .  We went in late one Saturday, it took them forever to get to us, they were out of menu items, but we still had a good time and good food.   Maybe they are more together when they are busy.   I will go again, slow service can be overlooked sometimes.
5	Absolutely enjoyed their food! Yum! I had chicken sandwich and a strawberry smoothie. I really loved the food there. Good location, great service and very clean washroom facility.
5	Minors customer service is outstanding. Greeted with free pop corn on entering the store. Then employees are eager to help you find what you are looking for.Went to garden area to look for a new tree for my back yard. Minors had a geeat selection to choose and the sales people were very knowledgeable about the trees.With there help I was able to make a knowledgeable decision.
