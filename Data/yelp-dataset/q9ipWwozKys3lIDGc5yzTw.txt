5	Great legal advice. Highly recommended! It has been hard to find good helpful service in Vegas. Mr. Berman and his staff where really helpful and went the extra mile to give me the right answers. Information  I hadn't been able to find anywhere else including Google searches on the subject.. Thanks a million Brian S.
5	I have used Marc Simon as my attorney for over 20 years on many matters.  His ability to grasp the story and help resolve problems has been a real plus for me.  Marc has handled many real estate matters from purchase and sale transactions to loans for cranes in the panama canal.  I highly recommend Marc Simon.
5	Marc Simon immediately grasped a very complicated situation and ran with it. He was easy to talk to and provided practical advice above and beyond the legal issues.
5	After consulting with many attorneys, I was referred to Mr. Berman.  Each of the other attorneys gave me a different resolution to my problem.  Mr. Berman spent a fair amount of time with me to discuss my situation.  He was upset that a few of the other attorneys were trying to take advantage of me as their next paycheck without resolving my issue.  He is trustworthy, honest and professional.  Other attorneys should follow his example Thank you very much Mr, Berman.
