1	After using this shower even walking through the worst of Scottish winters seems more apealling.I've witnessed a driver at the Gyle refuse to let a gay couple on the bus simply because they were holding hands, complaints were made but that driver is still to be seen on the buses large as life and twice as nasty.The seating is often awful, so crampt that I have to sit angled with my knees poking into the walkway. How hard is it to apply some fabric freshener to the upholstry? I smelt nicer odours when our spetic tank backed up!I do wish the drivers would tak the care they are meant to and not speed off when a number of people are still climbing the stairs. On one occassion this happened and several of us got knocked flying and I received most colourful bruising as a result.Even as you try to escape one of their vehicles you are not safe. On one occassion the doors were closed without checking resulting in my arm getting trapped and the contents of my bags being smashed. This was caught on their cameras but I did not even get an apology.
