5	I have been Smoking cigars and frequenting cigar lounges for quite a few years now, and I can not remember the last time I found a gem like Fine Ash. Sam and his wife, Rosie, are awesome, down to earth, friendly, and knowledgeable. The lounge is comfortable and the prices are very competitive. Every customer is made to feel welcome and appreciated. I found Fine Ash about a month ago and it feels like home. This truly is a Fine Ash Cigar Lounge.
