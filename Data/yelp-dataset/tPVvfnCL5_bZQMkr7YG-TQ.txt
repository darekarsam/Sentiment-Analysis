5	Love Tony for my nails and Lisa for my toes and eye brows! Great please... clean,  affordable...
5	I have been coming to this place for over 5 years. The service is outstanding. Even after moving away and only getting to come in occasionally, they still know my name and what services I prefer. The salon is clean and all the techs want you to be happy with your nails. If you're in chandler/Gilbert and you're looking for a great salon, you need to check this place out.
5	Love this place!!!!  Been going here for 9+ years!!!  Tony, Lisa and their staff are wonderful!!  I've been to a few other places before I found them...none compared!!  Their pedicures last a long time...even after being on the sandy beaches of California for a week!!
