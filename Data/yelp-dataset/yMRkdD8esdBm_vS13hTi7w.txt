4	One would think that this place is only doctors offices. However, they also do multiple cosmetic procedures such as line fillers, facial peels, and laser procedures. I purchased a groupon for two 30 minute laser treatments for spider veins (the upkeep never ends does it ladies??). This place is really easy to get to on 9th street and they have their own parking lot. The ladies at the desk were very friendly and as I filled out my paperwork they gave me some info/pricing about their establishment along with a few samples of sunscreen and eye cream (who doesn't love free samples???).My technician was Eve and she was easy going and friendly. She set me up, took some before photos, explained how the laser treatment worked and started zapping. At the end she made sure I had after-care instructions and asked me to make a follow up appointment so she could check on my progress. When I came back two weeks later she gave me the green light for my next appointment and also brought in the nurse practitioner to check on me too. My only negative was the appointment room was sort of small and the lighting wasn't great. I found it a little too dim to work, and I suggested Eve get another lamp to decrease eye strain.....well that's just the OT in me though.
3	Been coming here for years, really nice and good Doctors. My biggest complaint is I'll have an appointment for 9am and my Doctor won't come into my room to see me till 9:45am. The front office staff kinda suck and rude to me on the phone, they always have my info messed up. If it wasn't for Ann Lacey being super nice and helping me so much, I would've gone somewhere else a long time ago because of the dumb staff
