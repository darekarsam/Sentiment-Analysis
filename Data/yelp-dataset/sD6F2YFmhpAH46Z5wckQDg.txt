5	ONLY $2.99 or less! Stop by for great SAVINGS!
1	There is a reason why everything is 2.99 or less - that place only carries the cheapest and poorly made clothes!  Very poor service and no dressing rooms. One of the worst experiences I've ever had in a retail outlet. My advice. "Don't waste your money!"
5	Love this store I'm there every other day I am indeed a  regular . Great looking clothes and it really is 3 dollars or less . Totally in love with this store !!!
