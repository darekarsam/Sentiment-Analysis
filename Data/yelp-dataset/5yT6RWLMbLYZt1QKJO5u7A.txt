2	We went to the pond where there's ducks and a park.  Tried to get a bit of fresh air since the weather was finally cooling down.  It's really pretty, but it was a little difficult to have a picnic there since they had no tables and chairs.  The side walk and grass were filthy from all of the duck poop, so we had to be careful where we sat.  The park area was nice.  Overall, some maintenance would work.
4	I loved my visit here. It's beautiful, with geese and ducks. People fish here (catch and release), feed the birds and take walks in the area.  Sunsets are gorgeous over the water.
3	Nice place to come down to with the kids or just for a nice stroll along the water.Sometimes you'll have hoards of ducks, geese try and hassle you for a bite to eat but all in all not to bad.They have a nice open area with beach, basketball court and BBQ area for you to relax
4	Desert Shores Community is a great spot to walk, run, bike, or socialize with ducks and geese.I run or bike here from my house often and I like the wide bike lanes that wind around the lakes here.  There are huge trees for shade on hot days.  There are ducks that meander around, not just at the water's edge, but you'll find them crossing the streets, too, so look out!  It's a popular area for people of all ages doing their daily walks with dogs or each other, too.You can enter the community at several places including:  - Lake Mead Blvd. at Mariner Drive (near Buca di Beppo)- Lake Mead Blvd. at Harbor Island Drive (near Nevada State Bank)- Buffalo Dr. and Regatta Dr. (across the street from Babystacks Cafe)The lake usually has kids feeding ducks and people fishing.  There are benches for one to sit and enjoy the scenery.I highly recommend this area if you want to enjoy some time outdoors with scenic views, to commune with water fowl, and to get your heart rate up.
