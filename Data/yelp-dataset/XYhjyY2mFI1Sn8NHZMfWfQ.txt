5	What a great experience I just had at Firestone. Went there for a second opinion after going to the local Jeep dealer. After checking all the same of items Jeep cheeked, I was advised that 2 of them didn't need to be done and the other 2 items were done for literally half the price of the Jeep dealer.  One of them was an alignment. These guys get my future business for all my maintenance needs. Joe was great and Christian was helpful too.  Thanks guys!
1	If I could give less than one star, I would. Brought my F150 in for misfire. They diagnosed it and told me one cylinder is dead and I need a new engine after checking vacuum. I asked if the could email me the test results, they told me they don't have email capabilities. I asked for results of compression test, cylinder leak down, as well as fuel pressure readings and they told me they couldn't do that.
1	i wish i could give a lower rating. i went for a quick tire replacement and that was taken care of, minus the manager telling me i ruined my tire pressure sensor when i didnt. the worse part was after i get my car home i notice the person who parked it hit a curb with the bumper and ripped it. i called to speak to the manager and was told he was at lunch but since i drove home theres nothing anyone will do about it. very angry and filing a complaint with the BBB.
3	Not a good start: my appointment wasn't in their system and despite being told they could get me in right away, the "about an hour" needed to look over my car is now pushing 105 minutes. Otherwise, they verified what a different shop told me and their prices were about the same.
