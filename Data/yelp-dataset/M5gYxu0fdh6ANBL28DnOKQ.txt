2	Stopped here to wish a friend good luck and farewell (she was moving to Arizona) on 5/3/14 at around 5:00pm. The Kentucky Derby was just about to start, which probably added to some of the chaos and volume within this place.- Very odd parking lot; the parking spaces aren't parallel with the property, and they go all the way to the end of the lot, which could make entrance/exit during busy times quite tricky.+ Very big bar area; octagon shape, with a *ton* of bar stools+ Lots of seating around the bar area; combo of high-tops, booths, and tables+ More televisions than you'll find at most big box stores- Very, very, very, very loud (television noise)- Very limited tap beer selection, and nothing terribly exciting- Limited booze selection (at least in the rum arena - Bacardi only?)+ Drinks were cheap (1 mixer + 1 tap = $8)+ Bar accommodated the going away party quite nicely, even with the Kentucky Derby taking placeI'm not sure I'd go back to this place.
5	One of the best burgers you can get in sun prairie, it has a great flavor from the sauce they put in the meat. The owner is very knowledgeable and you can tell he has a true passion and takes pride in the meals he makes. I was very happy with my experience there.
2	Serves its purpose in catering to mid-20s dudes and guys who wear baseball caps. The occasional belch and waft of stale cigarette odor notwithstanding, not a bad place to catch a game. Otherwise, completely unremarkable.
4	Came after a badger game! Really great food for a good price. Seemed to be like good place to stop in. Was very happy with each aspect. Music was a tad loud to talk but that is all I can see in this good hometown classic.
4	Great, fast service.  The food was exactly what we wanted after the Badger game.  The burgers are made by hand (not pre-made patties) and the ability to upgrade to a pretzel bun was a bonus for me!  Plenty of tvs to catch the game on as well and a full bar.
