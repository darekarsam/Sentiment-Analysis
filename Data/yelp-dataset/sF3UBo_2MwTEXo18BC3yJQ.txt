1	Overall experience is VERY bad.  Use at your own risk!
5	The Optical Doctor they have on staff is great!! We followed him over from Pearle Vision. He talks softly but, is very professional and we always feel our exam was to the fullest.Will go back each year for our exams or unless an injury occurred and had to go in.
