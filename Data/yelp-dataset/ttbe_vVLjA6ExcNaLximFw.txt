5	Great Service, Great Hair Cut, Great Prices!
5	Super clean, very friendly and helpful staff, and a great haircut. I waited just a few moments after walking in the door to being seated. Efficient and well worth the price. I'll definitely go again.
4	Tina Beauty Hair Salon is THE place for me. After a long, difficult journey in finding a location where artistry meets hair, I've found it! Here, the hair stylists (artists) really listen to what you want to do and gently give you ideas, as well, resulting in a beautiful style! I recently brought a friend with me from out of town for her first "Phoenix haircut" and she LOVED it. I really recommend this place to anyone who wants a refreshing 'do. Book appointments early as they do book fast. Enjoy!
