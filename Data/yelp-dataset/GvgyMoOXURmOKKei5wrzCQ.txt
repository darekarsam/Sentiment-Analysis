4	In and out in no time.....  If you are looking for a quick car inspection without blowing half the day waiting in line go here.  I usually go Saturday mornings (early) to avoid the rush, but they seem to handle the 20 guy rush in the mornings (I guess great minds do think alike).The waiting room was recently revamped with a tv and chairs... before it looked kinda bad and dingy... like I haven't been cleaned in 20 years dingy.  You don't really spend too much time in the waiting room anyway, but at least it's an option.
5	I used to be in the auto repair business years ago and I highly recommend Mr Inspection in Matthews.  They are honest and will not find something that is not there.  They have a full crew of 4 guys and you get in and out fast.  PLEASE dont take your car for an inspection to any of the chains because you will be fleeced!  Clark Tire Indian Trail found things that did not need repair.
1	I'm a young adult female, and they were not honest with me. They went so far as to, while lying to my face about something that "needed to be fixed", hand me a business card and recommend a guy saying "he's honest." After I realized what went on, that in particular seemed very scummy. I wouldn't have known better but I asked my dad for help thankfully.  Once they saw I was having my dad work on my car and that I wouldn't be paying anyone to "fix" anything, they passed my vehicle. I won't go into a long story but it was obvious they were trying to rip me off.  They are fast though. If you appear to not be knowledgeable about cars though they will try to take advantage
