5	No, I am not pregnant. I NEEDED chocolate cake, bad, and they had it. It's a huge, clean store, and the cashier was funny.
3	If you are trying to cook anything near ethnic or exotic, have fun trying what you need at this location. This is pretty much a run of the mill super market that has your Bacon, milk, eggs, and bread. The produce is usually in pretty good shape, and the dudes at the deli counter are hilarious and make the disappointment of not find stuff I need more bearable. I don't know what happened to all the reviews for this place but it seems a lot of places are re-adding their business so they can eliminate older reviews.
5	They did an awesome job on my in-laws' anniversary cake. Also on our anniversary cake recently. I highly recommend their bakery.
