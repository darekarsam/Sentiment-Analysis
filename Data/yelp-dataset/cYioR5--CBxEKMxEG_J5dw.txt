3	It's no LoLo's but it got me over a fried chicken craving, I'd give this 2.5 stars if I could. I don't think KFC is as good as it used to be, but hard to say since my palate has certainly refined over the years. The gal at the drive thru was very friendly, so there's my bonus .5 star.
2	I can just imagine all the hardships that those fabled explorers Lewis & Clark had to endure as they explored the unchartered West of the USA from 1804 to 1806. Harsh weather conditions and long hunting expeditions in search of food.In my quest for sustenance today I ventured out to the local KFC to bag some chicken. It was like watching a movie scene in slow motion as it took probably close to 10 minutes before I received my food. Yeah, we've come a long way since 1806 where they could only wish to even capture any food within 10 minutes. In addition, I guess since the outdoor air temperature is only 89 they didn't feel like it was worthy to turn on the air conditioning. There was no air flow with fans, it was stifling in the restaurant.Now the food did taste great but there is plenty of room left to improve the customer service and ambience of this place.
1	Can't see myself ever coming back. Went through the drive through and had to wait about 3-4 minutes before someone even took my order. Then waited another 5 minutes before I got to the window (there was only 1 car in front of me). Once I got to the window they repeated an order that wasn't mine, so I had to repeat it. They took my money and then I sat for over 10 minutes! The manager passed by the window a number of times and never made eye contact. They opened the window only to tell me that it would be another 4 minutes and I should pull around to wait. I could've made my own chicken dinner at that point.
