5	LOVE LOVE The Wallpaper Market!  HUGE selection of papers and so helpful.  I am thrilled when people under promise and OVER deliver.  I was told it would take about two weeks for the paper to arrive at my home.  My rolls arrived within 4 days.  From PHX it is kind of a hike, but totally worth it!
5	I love this place. I'm new to the world of decorating and Dee is so kind and helpful! So much to choose from. The only downside is that it's so far from my location.
5	LOVE the wallpaper market. One of my friends (a fabulous interior designer) got me hooked and I may never be the same. Dee and Donna are ridiculously knowledgeable and if you walk in with ANY kind of idea of what you want, "the wonder twins" will dial it in for you. We did our front room/living room and it's always a WOW followed by tons of compliments whenever anyone enters the house. All great quality papers...all at totally competitive prices. But you can't beat D&D for the money. They are PRICELESS!!Can't wait to get going on our next room!!!
5	Dee is awesome. I have done a lot of business with the wallpaper market over the years.
5	Dee is awesome. I have done a lot of business with the wallpaper market over the years.   First tip; if you need help, advice etc, go when Dee is there.  She is so talented and knowledgable of the books and can help you coordinate and achieve ALL of your decorating goals.
5	Just ordered a ton of paper from Dee.  Paper arrived QUICKLY and we were able to get it hung before our movers came.  Kenny did an excellent job.  I am not shy to sing her praises or to use her for fabrics.  One stop and I was able to get 99% of what I wanted.  Worth the drive.
