5	Let me just start with I found Krissy on the istagram app. I fell in love with all her pictures right away!! I hired her for my Hair services for my Wedding in Las Vegas. Not only was she brilliant but she is kind, professional and so nice to talk to. She took her time, and made me feel like a real princess  for my wedding. My hair is suppper kinky & curly. She was able to get it nice and straight with no problems.. (she does ALL HAIR TYPES) and of course she puts her shine into it. Truly talented anybody needing services call up Krissy. I know i will again! Only thingi  forgot to do for my wedding but i was so busy anyways.. i wish woulda got  the Spray Tan she offers next time in Vegas,I will be getting more services with her. Give her a call! Thanks again Krissy  :)
