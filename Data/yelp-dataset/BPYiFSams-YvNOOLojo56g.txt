4	Great lanes!  Right off of Washington Road these particular lanes are in an older building but it has been kept rather well.  Automated lanes & scoring as well as properly waxed lanes make for a great bowling experience.  The restrooms are a tad on the small side, considering this place has 50 lanes.There's a bar, cafeteria, pro shop, and other amenities.  Coupled with good service it is definitely worth the trip.
4	They offer the free bowling for kids summer program, which is great - each child gets 2 games per day free, though you do have to pay for shoes, which was around $4.  The lanes are clean and well lit, there are a few video games and air hockey, plenty of bowling balls in all weights for everyone.  The only downside is the Lounge (snack bar) which is VERY overpriced and the service was pretty slow.  At one point while we were there, a customer had to go find a manager after waiting and using the service button to no avail.
1	The place is dirty and the staff are rude!  They treat you like you are bothering them...angry and nasty!!  The bathrooms stink and are never clean.  Don't go here.
