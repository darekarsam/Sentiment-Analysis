1	Why would chase assign a personal banker for location I've never been too?? They asked me to come in to meet my personal banker. I get to the bank at 5 like I was asked. For my personal banker to tell me I have the right accounts. I'm not sure what I was expecting but thanks Chase for wasting my time.
4	Clean, short wait times, and friendly and efficient staff.Not sure the hate in the other review is even relevant..but all-in-all a great Chase locatoin in south Scottsdale.They even have dum-dum suckers for the kiddos (or kid at heart...yeah...I took one)
3	I only go to this bank when it's daylight time, I would not feel safe to go after night time even thought there's plenty of lights around the entrance and the ATM.
