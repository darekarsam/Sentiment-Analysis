5	I know, I know, five stars seems a little steep for fast food place like this, but it really deserves it. You figure we rate a business based on how good it is thinking of what the best it can be is. This place always has hot, great tasting food, served with a smile and it's always fast. Super clean inside, always consistent. It's pretty much the same few employees and they start to recognize you after a while. Mmmmm just talking about them in this review makes me want to go get some chili cheese fries!
3	Well. I won't give it 5 stars, but I'll go 3.Bring the alka - seltzer. As I live and breathe.For God's sake .  You might not want to eathere before a hookup. This is an "I'm effinhungry, I want it fast and cheap " kindaplace. The kind of place where you go byyourself and eat it like a dog... if you thoughtI was kidding about the alka seltzer - I wasn't.
5	Customer service here is phenomenal! Food is always excellent unless I overstuff myself :)
4	I love this place. Growing up in Southern California I would eat this often and still do. The 5 chili dogs or corn dogs for $5 is a steal. If you have them add cheese then they steal from you so take my tip and bring your own kraft singles from home people! .40 cents per dog adds up! The pretzel bun is good too. They have daily specials on the taste-freez goodies.
2	Pricey to have all ALL BEEF dogs; are meal was almost $25!-Curly cheese & chili fries had barely any cheese and just a tad more chili than nothing at all. -Caramel dipped cones were good, but also scrawny compared to DQ.
