2	A large cheap restaurant with various food on the prix fixe daily menu.
2	It's a decent 'deli style' restaurant and their prices are reasonable. The lasagna was good, but it's not a fancy/trendy place. Nothing too elaborate, just OK food.
2	The food is good, I only go for the mashed potatoes for breakfast.... if you have two hours to spare waiting for coffee, food, a waitress or waiter....
4	Decent food, friendly service, they were weekend slammed when we arrived, but once we got our order in the food came very quickly. Noting really on the menu for vegetarians outside of breakfast though.
