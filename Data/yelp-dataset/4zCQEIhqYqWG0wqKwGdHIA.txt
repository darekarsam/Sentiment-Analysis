4	Good food at a good price. Nothing to complain about this place, good atmosphere, lots of booths, fast and friendly service, good all around place when everyone wants something different. Known for their smoked meat and pizzas everything is good on the menu. Except the rotisserie chicken, the only meal I didn't enjoy here.
5	Moes is a primo West Island "Institution". Great food, portions & professional service. Well worth a visit.
