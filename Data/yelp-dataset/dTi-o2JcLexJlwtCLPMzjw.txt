4	I don't know anything about a military surplus store, so I have nothing to base this review off of in that regard. However, we went in for a Halloween costume, and the guy behind the counter was FANTASTIC!!! My boyfriend told him he wanted to be Cobra Commander and the guy went to work putting something together. He was very knowledgeable and he knew exactly the style of outfit that the commander wore and hooked us up with some great deals. There was a clearance rack and I felt like he gave us great option for the cheaper side of things, or the more elaborate and expensive type of things. He was incredibly patient, and super friendly. I have nothing but great things to say about these guys and how helpful they were on our visit. I was looking for MRE meals because I take people on haunted vacation trips, and I think it may be a good option for my guests. I told him about my idea and he gave me some tips on what to get and what not to get. He told me that they are sometimes hard to get, but they offer some decent prices for them and you can get a deal to purchase them in bulk. I'd go back to this place in a second when I have a need for this type of thing. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because I think their prices can be a little on the high side for some of their used stuff.
