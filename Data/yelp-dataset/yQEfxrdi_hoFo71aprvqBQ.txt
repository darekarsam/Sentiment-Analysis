5	We have been staying at this hotel for ~10yrs when we come for the F1 races.  I'm almost scared to post this and give up such a great secret.  It's got the best location, prices, and service.  It's on Crescent and Rene Levesque - a block from the Metro and of course Crescent St is the place for the F1 action.  The staff is wonderful and they don't gauge you during F1 days for pricing as most places do.  It's basic service with some nice amenities including free internet, each room now has an iron & board, in-room fridge.  They don't have a lot of rooms so if you want you need to book ahead; we book a year ahead.  I can't say enough good things about these folks.
5	I have been meaning to write a review for what has became my second home in Montreal.I love this place so much, the effort the staff go to make you happyExcellent location.Incredible value for moneyFriendly and warm staffVery clean and plentiful amount of clean towels ect.Free unlimited wifiThoroughly recommend. Yes it is no frills in some ways! But I have yet to find a place that has the hospitality and all round best hotel experience of the Y Hotel Montreal
5	Great location, inexpensive, cheap and clean accommodation. I stayed in the double bed room with a private bathroom. It was just a three minute walk from the sheraton hotel where I had to attend a conference. My room, which was 85$ plus taxes a night, had a small fridge, a small television, coffee maker and an ironing board and iron. There's a cafe downstairs which is open from 7-2pm and has some good options for breakfast and lunch. Crescent street and it's restaurants are just a short walk from this hotel. Payment is upfront when you check in. Check in time is 3pm and check out is 12 noon. Overall, great place. I highly recommend it!
