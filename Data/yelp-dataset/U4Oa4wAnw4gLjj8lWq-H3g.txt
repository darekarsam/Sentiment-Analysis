3	I found the restaurant to have a very nice, clean, homey atmosphere. The service was good.  The most shocking part to me was the fish. I found the black bass and chilean sea bass to be very average. The meals came with lima beans and rice.
2	Expensive for what you actually get. Fish was also overcooked, which is sad for a restaurant that specializes in fish...
3	Food was tasty and fresh. However I was taken aback by the fact that they do not accommodate to families. What restaurant does not have a hi chair or booster seat in this day and age. We dine out frequently at both upscale and family style restaurants and I never was told that they don't have a hi chair booster seat. That being said, it's unfortunate for the restaurant that they did not retain this customer as I will not be returning there. I hope this review helps those who have young children.
5	"There was plenty of food to be had. Started off with green salad for one, which was clearly enough for 2 and a tomato and onion salad. There were 3 of us. Sister-in-law and I shared an entree - Chilean sea bass which was a tad over done but not dry. Hubby had the flank steak which is closed to a cuban salteado garlic steak.
5	The best Greek restaurant I have ever been to, and I have been to many. The grilled octopus was delicious, crispy out and tender in.  Real Greek salad, no lettuce. The salad for one was enough for two... I can't imagine the salad for two!Chilean sea bass was prepared to perfection and so were the lamb chops with enough fat on them to make it a delicacy. Grilled vegetables exquisitely done!  Everything we ordered exceeded my expectations.
