5	Wow! Great service! Their web page is user friendly and they have around 30-40 different restaurants. I ordered my lunch online at 11:45 and received it at 12:15 - that was quick:) Thanks for the speedy service! And my lasagna was super hot and delicious! I will definitely be using them again!

5	Online restaurants is awesome!  I first tried this website about 2 years ago and love it.  I usually order from this place once a week if not more.  Some of the restaurants I frequently order from are Amore taste of Chicago I recommend the deep dish pizza mad Greek has some great gyros and taste of china has an awesome deal on the family dinners. A bonus to using the online restaurants website is they always seem to have coupons and discounts for all of their contracted restaurants.  Also, Drivers are very quick on the order!  Five stars !!
5	Sushi delivery from one of my favorite places! Awesome. Fast, easy & supper good service.
