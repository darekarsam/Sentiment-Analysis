3	Went here for pre-employment drug screen.  Nice clean environment with a very pleasant receptionist.  Dropping a few stars since I arrived 5 minutes after they opened, just moments after another person arrived.  The rest of the waiting area was empty, yet we had to wait almost a half hour to be taken to the back.
3	Went here back in April after taking a header at work.  Front desk staff were friendly, but never stayed shorter than 1.5 hours, even with scheduled appointments.  Felt like the Doctor didn't understand my pain and problem...  PT onsite was great, highly recommend that.
1	I went here on Christmas Eve for a UTI, and they did not do a pregnancy test first.  I told them I could possibly be pregnant on my paperwork.  They prescribed Cipro for my infection and 2 days later I found out that I was indeed pregnant.  The medication was not recommended for pregnant women.   I would not recommend this facility.
2	I came in and was told that there would be a 45 minute to a one hour wait... Someone behind me was told that there would be a 3 hour wait... The place is clean, I came in for a drug screen and a TB test for work, which I really didn't think would take so long. Inside the lobby this man was complaining that they dumped his piss because it wasn't the right temp. Another man was complaining that he wasn't injured after he ran a red light and hit some people. The front staff was very polite and helpful. It just seems like they are understaffed and just take FOREVER. there are two tv's in the lobby and information pamphlets. Plenty of chairs and the staff uniform and hygiene is very appropriate.
