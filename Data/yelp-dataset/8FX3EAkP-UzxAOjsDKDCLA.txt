5	I recently visited a website created from the boys at 8 Bit Evolution. I've had  friends and fellow game collectors invite me to numerous lame, and disgraceful gaming sites for years. Claiming they had fair pricing, "rare" games, etc etc. Then I stumbled upon 8 Bit Evolution, I was amazed at the titles they had listed, which consisted mainly of non-US released titles! Not to mention the ridiculous HAND AIRBRUSHED Gameboy Advances and Sega Genesis consoles. I was expecting to see astronomical prices, however, was shocked when I saw state of the art memorabilia, for reasonable prices. I ordered a custom Gameboy Advanced mainly due to my love of the TMNT, only to discover that for the price I paid, I also received a LED light, for in-the-dark gaming( I seemed to of overlooked that feature listed in on the site before purchasing, was more focused on the art work). Through and through, I was impressed with quality of work, professionalism, and time of delivery! I visit 8 Bit's Site once a week to see what kind of games/ custom consoles they release to the public next!
5	Retro gaming is my thing as I am from the Sega Genesis/ NES/ GBA generation. My poor GBA died years ago though so when I found these guys and saw the work they do I was amazed, and hooked. Not only do these units look good though their function is improved as they have a backlight system that is far superior to the original setup. My unit is a custom Wario one as he is my favourite from the Mario unit but they actually do anyone/anything you want.
5	I learned of this company from VSauce3 on YouTube.  I ordered a Gameboy Advance and holy cow is it cool!  This is like a brand new unit!  The company answered my questions very quickly and were very appreciative of my order.  Phenomenal product and service!  Be sure to spend the extra $$$ on a glass screen - well worth it!!!
