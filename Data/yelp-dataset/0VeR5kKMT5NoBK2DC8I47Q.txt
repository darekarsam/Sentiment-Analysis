2	A nice selection of higher end suitcases and backpacks if you're looking to purchase something that the airlines can toss around while you blast your way through the skies at 400 miles an hour. They have regular suitcases, rollaboards, spinners and the like ranging in size from small to extra large.Prices, in the other hand, range from medium to high. I don't know about you, but I'm just not going to spend $180 for a rollaboard suitcase unless it comes stuffed with $1 bills.
1	Travelpro makes some great bags, BUT the "Lifetime Warranty" is worthless.  Don't be fooled; the "Lifetime Warranty" has a very limited lifetime.  I paid a lot for a Travelpro carry-on and after several years the fabric at the bottom ripped.  It was not abused at all.  The local Travelpro service center said this was normal wear and tear and they could repair it for $85.  Really, repair a carryon for $85?  I contacted Travelpro directly and they came back with the same thing, specifically "If a bag has faulty or weak material it will reveal itself very early on in the life of the bag."  I see, so the "Lifetime Warranty" is very short.  I am totally bummed out.  Offering a "Lifetime Warranty" then not honoring it is very bad business.  Next time I will buy a more honest brand.
