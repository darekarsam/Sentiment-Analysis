5	Master Leland Brandon's Black Belt Academy (ATA or American Taekwondo Association)Located on the southeast corner of Wigwam Parkway and Pecos.This school came highly recommended by one of my friends. I went in and checked it out....I'm hooked!If you want to look at training in martial arts or Krav Maga (Israeli Street Fighting), give them a call or drop by the studio and they can explain everything to you.cmon dont be shy
5	Everyone on staff is great - they are wonderful with the kids.  Their upbeat personalities really help my son stay focused during class and he looks forward to his lessons.
