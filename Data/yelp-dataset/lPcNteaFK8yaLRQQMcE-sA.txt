5	Awww the staff here is wonderful they always know what I want and best of all they know my name which really adds to the experience! The drinks and food are amazing as well!
5	Going to echo the other reviews and say that the staff here is WONDERFUL! After a somewhat disappointing service experience at Nordstrom's, I was pleasantly surprised by the attentiveness and positivity of the guys that work at the counter. The E-bar is located on the 2nd floor by the entrance where Nordstrom's intersects with the main mall area.During my short visit I ordered up my double shot of espresso and grabbed a snack box of cheese, fruit and crackers for later. Espresso was stellar and that snack box? I know this will sound slightly ridiculous but I still DREAM about it! It was the BEST SNACK BOX EVER!!! The lavosh crackers in it are tasty bits of heaven, the fruit was sweet and the cheese a perfect match. If you live in Scottsdale would you mind finding out who makes these and send me a few? 31 Yelps Challenge: #16/31
5	My first visit to Nordstrom's coffee place here in the mall and I'm impressed. Great service, just the right selection of coffee and food stuffs, and a reasonable price to boot.
5	This is the cafe you want to go to for strong coffee.Go early because they sell out quick.
5	The staff is always friendly!  The green tea was great the last time I got it.  This Saturday I got an orange pineapple spritzer and it was absolutely fantastic.
4	The service here was pretty swift, here even for a lunch hour. We ordered a salted caramel mocha. I muat say, their lattes are very rich! Our beverage was a bit on the salty side but it was still enjoyable. I recommend  this place if you're looking for a nice pick-me-up. The staff is very efficient and courteous.
