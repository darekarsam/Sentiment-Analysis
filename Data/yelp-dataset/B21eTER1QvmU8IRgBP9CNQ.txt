5	Legacy lanes is simply the best bowling experiejnce you will find in Pittsburgh. The food is top notch.  The bowling alley itself is top notch.  The sports bar is a great place to catch a game. My family threw a private party in there reserved area.  I would recommend hosting a party at legacy lanes to anyone
1	Food-You lost a great customer- my soon to be husband would always brag about how great your breakfast was. Well we went there today. It over priced for food that you order at a counter. No server and to top it off they forgot our toast and when I went to pick it up..... There was a hair on the plate! Gross!! I left the plate at the counter! What a waste of $20+ today, i can't believe I even tipped them.We left without finishing our meal and I called to complain, I spoke with Patrick who was very nice and understanding, he offered for us to come back for a free breakfast on him. That was nice of him but I would rather have my money back. Oh well! They do have a nice bowling alley with a VIP section, just eat before you go!
1	i would give negative star if possible - constant problems with the lane during our 5 games, staff wasnt of any help, at all. it's my first time, as well as last time.
