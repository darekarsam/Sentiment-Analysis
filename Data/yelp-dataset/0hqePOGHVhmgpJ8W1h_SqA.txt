5	My husband and I have been members at this Massage Envy for the past 6 years. We have had a variety of therapist and for the most part, they have all been great. The key is to always keep a list of your favorites in your phone and book early! We love to get 1.5-2 hour sessions and not all of the therapist do more than and hour. Excellent location and they offer a couples room which is great for friends or couples! Highly recommend them!
5	I've been going here for nearly a year and it's great.  Front desk staff is always extremely friendly and I love my massage therapist.  Definitely a great value!
5	Really friendly helpful staff! My mom got her first massage here. Ask for Natalia or Katie.
5	I've been going here for about a year and have seen at least 5 different therapists.  All were GOOD, but CANDIE is the best.  She is so in-tuned with your bodies needs and where it's sensitive.  She listens and my body is very grateful for it!Staff is always kind and hospitable!
5	Great way to get an affordable massage!  Hailey at the front desk was so great the day we joined and she always has a friendly smile every time we come!!  Try Byron he is my favorite therapist and he is really "in tune" with helping and healing.  Amazing!!!
5	This location is clean, on time and has very professional, skilled therapists. One of the very best Massage Envy locations, I recommend it. Plus, when I  call last minute, they usually can accommodate me, such a bonus!
