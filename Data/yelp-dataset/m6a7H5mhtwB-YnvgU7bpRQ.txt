1	I purchased a reclining leather loveseat/sofa combo from them,when they delivered it, they took the protective plastic off on the truck they rubbed it on the stucco on my house on the way in and damaged both, they refused to do anything about it, its also missing a protective plastic foot and the seat backs arent installed correctlly so you can't recline it, I also bought a dining room table from them, brand new out of the box, the latch to open the table to add a leaf was broken, they also won't fix it, I've called them repeatedly, they see my number on caller ID and either let it go to voice mail or tell me the manager is unavailable, don't waste your time or money on this rip off place........
1	UpdateI took them to small claim court and won a judgement for them to take back the furniture and pay me back!
4	The sales people on the floor are a tid bit pushy they assume because your looking eather you need to buy or leave. Everyone was nice so I can assume they were ready to go home after a long day. I wont return. I went down the street and got a full bedroom set so its their lost. Next time maybe they wont rush they clients.
1	Awful service! Once you buy the product they have no regard for the quality. Owner is an asshole that does not care about customer service. Do not buy from here, you will end up spending more time and money in the long run
4	I purchased furniture here 2x. I got a Q mattress with box, bed frame, 2 night stands, coffee table with 4 leather chairs, 2 accent plates, and key rack with mirror for 1G. 2nd purchase was for an entertainment center and storage bench for $474. All Coaster furniture. - Excellent service! Very attentive. Frank was very interested in my business. Bless his heart as he walked with a limp showing off all kinds of furniture. - I brought ads from other furniture stores, GROUPON furniture, LV FurnitureOnline, even from their competitor, Furniture World, and they said they can beat any price! Believe me, they did!- All my furniture came from the Coaster catalog, except the plates and key rack with mirror. Those were bonus :). Everything BRAND NEW! NOT CLEARANCE.- They say the same lines: "I'm the rep for.." "Vendors all over the world come to World Market 2x a year. We pick up what they don't buy."- Dealing with furniture pricing, you gotta talk to the BOSS. Sales associates will give you a deal, but FRANK will stamp that deal...you know what I'm sayinnnn' - NO haggle pricing. But still the Asian in me had to even get a better deal. Haha. - 1st order, delivery was swift! Order on Tuesday. Got it on Friday evening. They promised Thursday, but eh, they were accommodating. - 2nd order, also pretty quick. Ordered Friday morning. Furniture came Sunday. Delivery on Tuesday! what what! Coaster furniture is somewhere in SoCal. Delivery time.- Didn't have to pay for Delivery fee 2x! $65 delivery and furniture installation. - On the 2nd order, bc I got such a great deal, they didn't want to install the furniture so were gonna charge me $45. I said no. Then an hour later, they said we'll do the entertainment for $20. Okay! - Hector came to deliver and I had to help bring up my OWN furniture. Guy had a swollen leg. Poor guy. Poor me. - Anyway, John was great. Terri was cool. Scott was nice. Great place. Wouldn't go anywhere else. Big's Furniture sells Coaster, too at a rip off price! Definitely shop around before you make a decision. There's plenty to chose from around here.
5	bed came in early, LVFCC contacted me setup delivery... hector (eddie) and louis the delivery team were courteous, respectful of my place and neighbors (it was a sunday morning delivery) - they also put the bed together quickly!!!overall i'd strongly recommend this merchant if you are looking for very reasonably priced furniture sold by a team of pros that know what they are doing....
5	I have been a long time customer of this store. They have always been extremely helpful and reasonable priced. I would recommend them to anyone. The staff is extremely knowledgeable in there product. Yes there have been some problems as with everything, but they always do everything they can to resolve the issues as quickly as possible. I have to say thanks to Frank, Scott, Terri, John, George, Eddy, Derek, Hector and Fernando. When I hit hard times and lost my job and No one wanted to hire me because I was over qualified. The whole crew helped me out with work. Shortly after Frank came to me and hired me full time.It was a blessing for me my wife and three kids. For that I am more thankful than words can express.If anyone has any issues or any questions my email is laustin555@gmail.com. Contact me and I will do anything I can to help. Just like they did when I needed it.
5	Yesterday we bought 2 reclining sofas and a tv stand for under $1,200. They look wonderful, are very comfy and appear to be well made. We had just left Ashley Furniture down the street because they were SO expensive (the same set up would have been about $4k at Ashley). I saw the Arm Waving Inflatible Tube Man outside of LV Furniture and we decided to go in. Scott was our salesperson and he was super friendly and helpful. Everyone was nice. The selection was adequate and they we eager to bargain! We had an entirely new tv room set, delivered and in place, by nightfall. I will recommend LV Furniture to everyone I know.
5	I bought a memory foam mattress and a dining room set here.  I have very thin patience when it comes to horrible company.  However, Frank is such a doll.  He loves what he does and the entire company seems to be family run.  I love that fact.  He was blunt when I asked if everything was made in China.  Usually, everyone I ask will try to hide the fact that it was made in China.  I'm Chinese, my dad use to import and export furniture from China.  I know quality, I know over-priced furniture, I know when you're throwing bullshit at my face.  Frank was blunt about everything.  He would tell you how much he got out of the profit of what he is selling you.  He will make sure you're getting a good deal and he will also get some sort of profit from it.  That's what a business is.  I love my mattress. I get complimented on my dining room set constantly.  Although I did have issues obtaining the actual merchandise, it wasn't their fault.  My fiance was going to training in Missouri, and I literally had half a day to figure my shit out before he left.  (Gotta love having someone Military, right? -_-)  Frank tried hard to figure out ways to help me out.  In the end, I figured something out.  I barely gave them any notice of me coming to pick up my stuff.  Literally, I worked in an hour, I barely had any time. (Another joy of having more than one job.)  They were literally unloading the truck and loading it with other delivers, while running everywhere trying to find my stuff.  Of course, I was being a little bitch, but they were patient with me and I truly appreciated that.
1	They opened up another store in Henderson. Its on boulder highway. Do yourself a favor and shop someplace else for furniture If you do make the mistake of shopping here, be prepared for horrific customer service and lots of lies
1	*********DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY*********SURE THEY ARE NICE AND FRIENDLY WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO GET YOUR BUSINESS THEN AFTERWARDS BEWARE!!!!!!  First they state No Credit Check on their store windows but when you go to apply in order to get approved you have to show a mountain of paperwork, then after all of that they don't approve you for the full amount of purchase so you still have to come out of pocket with cash.  They also charge a $45 application fee approved or not. Then I had to pick out another table cause they couldn't finance me for what I wanted so they had to do different paperwork and if Teri isn't there those salesmen are lost and have no clue what is going on.  Then they never gave me a copy of the second invoice showing the cash I paid. A red flag should have gone up the minute I walked into that store and saw the mountain of paperwork of orders and a computer that looks like 1989 is waiting for it to come home.I purchased a dinging room table with 6 chairs from them.  They delivered it and set it up. After they left went to put chairs around the table two chairs do not fit on one side cause the width of the two chairs combined are wider than the table allows where the legs are.  Second the chairs have been loose when one broke only a few weeks after i had the table they told me to bring it in for replacement or repair which i did and almost two months later and several phone calls later I still have not received the chair back.  The other night I was sitting at the table doing an online college course I got up to get a drink of water went to sit back down and before i know it I was on the floor, the chair completely broke underneath me and I called them to ask about getting my money back and she told me to email her a copy of my invoice and when she replied she said that they would fix and tighten the chairs but not return my money or give me a replacement.  Now why would I go and return more chairs to them if they haven't returned the one from over a month ago.  Do I have stupid written on my forehead?  So I replied back to her stating my issues just this evening as I am writing this so I am waiting for a response.  But I am seeking other options.**************DO NOT PURCHASE ONE SINGLE ITEM FROM THIS STORE*****************The Better Business Bureau has been notified.*************************************************************************************************************                                 Here is their response from the BBB complaint"Customer was called to pick up new chair and she has not picked it up yet.Customer sent a picture of the damaged chair and the manufacturer decided that the breakage was not normal use. We try to accommodate every customer, but if you are leaning back on your chair and it breaks, that is not how a dining chair should be used."This is a bunch of baloney.  How can they determine if I was leaning back in the chair if FOUR of the SIX chairs have something wrong with them.  I am currently in the process of writing my response to the BBB. And I will continue updating this review as I get information.
1	My first review is under the not recommended section of yelp.  Do your self a favor and don't bother even going into this place to shop.  The quality of furniture is very poor.  Spend the extra money and go to a reputable furniture store like Walker furniture or Ashley or RC Wiley.  Spend the extra money with them.  Saving money at this place isn't even worth it because in the end you will spend more time fighting with them than the money you would save shopping with them.
5	great company great people. i buy everything here.
5	I bought a sectional couch there. We were able to customize the fabrics and pillows. Frank and Todd were easy to work and very knowledgable. There wasn't much sales pressure like the type I've been reading here. My sectional actually came in earlier than promised and delivered according to the schedule I requested . We've since been back to order a matching ottoman which I expect will be in any day. If that comes in with no problems, I will happily continue to do business with them. Their prices are fair and you get very high quality furniture for those prices.
