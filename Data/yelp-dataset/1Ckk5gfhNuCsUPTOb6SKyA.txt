5	HONEST!!! Need I say more? They were thorough, speedy, and courteous. It's the kind of service you would expect from a small town family owned business. They repaired my van for less than the initial estimate price. I'm so impressed their service that I'm actually excited to take my vehicles there for service. I highly recommend stamps auto! Also, Cameron, Mike, and John were wonderful to deal with over the phone and in person! Kudos guys, keep up the great work!
1	Ridiculously overpriced! I will admit they are very cunning with words, they can make the simplest thing seem like you should be paying too much for their service.In regards to customer service quality I am very disappointed. I watched them get oil prints all over the car inside and out and when they went to wipe them down to not make it look so bad they used an oil covered rag. I made a concerted effort to explain I felt they were over priced and explained that maybe I didn't have a full understanding of the work and rather than be friendly and explain their position the associate became defensive and argumentative. Simply put, I will not be going back.
