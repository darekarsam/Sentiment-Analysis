2	The Oratoire Saint Joseph is quite a landmark, as it can be seen from incredibly far away across Montreal. But Getting up there can be a hassle if you're a pedestrian, and once you do make it up, the chapel inside is very lean. There is nothing to see. No art, no decorations, nothing at all except high white walls and dark wooden seats. I'm sure they're impressive in their own way, but being European I must admit that after having done the climb once, I was massively disappointed! They do have a very popular Christmas service, but I haven't been to it as I am not Catholic. On the other hand, the view from above the observatory is delightful, and a place I would definitely go visit again. To get there you need a car and a very good knowledge of the back streets of the Mount Royal, but it's definitely worth it.

5	This was a great site to see. It was very ethereal there and we went on a sunday afternoon and there was mass going on which was lovely to participate in even if you aren't catholic. The view for the Oratoire Saint Joseph was phenomenal. The view is beautiful and you can see all of montreal with an unobstructed view from the terrace. If you are visiting montreal, this place is a must visit.Inside you can see the tomb of Joseph and light vigil candles and pray for the saints.
5	Calm, serene, quiet, beautiful. Lots of steps which can be challenging in winter (my wife and I went on a day that it was below zero outside following the largest snowfall in MTL in around 40 years) but it was well, well worth it.
