3	Previously listed as closed despite the fact it's quite open.  Like the other Goodwill I've reviewed this one is also quite standard.  I didn't see as large of a selection as the University City location, but it was more organized.  Not much else of note other than what you'd expect to see at Goodwill.
3	Pretty typical Goodwill.  Mostly use the donation drop off here.  The shopping center is a bit hard to get in and out of since Harris has that large island so be mindful and patient at the lights when you have to make u-turns.The store itself isn't really all that different from the other area locations.  This one doesn't seem as frequented as the others every time I come here.  Parking lot is never full and it's not too crazy inside.
3	A bit nicer than other good wills I've been to but the quality has gone down a lately.  You used to be able to find some brand new and high quality clothes tiger, now it's all low quality stuff you couldn't sell at a yard sale.
