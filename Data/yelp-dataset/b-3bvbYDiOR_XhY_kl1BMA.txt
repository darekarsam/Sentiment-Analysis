1	DOG OWNER BEWARE!!!! Do Not take your dog here!!! We took our two dogs here and when we picked them up they were butchered!!! We have a Maltese and a Lhasa Apso, we asked for a teddy bear cut and not to cut my Lhasa's Goatee. We got them back and they were shaved down like a five year old had done it. My Lhasa looked like a giant rat! The lady was very rude. She is cheap, but you get what you pay for. DO NOT GO HERE. DOG OWNER BEWARE!!!
4	I have been taking  my dog(7yr old) here for three  years and have yet to be disappointed. They have been my most used groomer since I have had my dog.  To me customer service is key.  When previous groomers have failed I just chose a new groomer.  WPS has been courteous and attentive to my dog's needs.  I will continue to have my dog groomed here until they fail, I move or my dog dies.
1	I first went here when they originally opened.  I brought in my 2 dogs and groom was OK.  Second time I went there not overly pleased, but prices were ok.  3rd and last time I went there I asked for the early appointment, as one of my dogs is not very social and I did not want him in a cage all day.  I got a call around 11 am that they were done, so I went to pick them up.  When I went to pay the bill, the owner added $20 to my bill for the early appointment.  I said to her that she did not disclose this when I made the appointment and I didn't feel I should have to pay the extra fee.  she would not budge, so therefore, I will never be back.  Kelly did not show any degree of wanting to please the customer whatsoever.
