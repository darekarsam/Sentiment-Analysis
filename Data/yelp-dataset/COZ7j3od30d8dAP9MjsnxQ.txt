5	The pool and beach has been hard on my feet this summer so I'm always in the mood for a nice pedicure.  Luckily, my girl knew just the place!  Emma's Nail Spa is a great lil nail salon that's tucked into the Centennial Marketplace in Scottsdale.  I've been there a couple of times for pedicures and am always impressed by how clean and professional it is.  Adam usually does my pedicures but my friend says she's tried Tara, Darla and Shawn and they're all good.  I just like Adam because he's friendly and gives a nice scrub and massage.  We usually get the Delux Pedicure, which is $35 before tip, but they have a Basic Pedi for only $23 before tip, (those prices are current for July 2013, btw).  They also do Manicures, Acrylic & Gel nails and have waxing services.  Ask about student pricing, if you've got proof you're a student.  Oh and, apparently, Emma's took over an old salon named Desert Nail about a year ago.  Give Emma's a chance and you'll be happy you did. See ya there!
5	A clean place, with professional and friendly staff. I sometimes take my young daughters there and they are always sweet to them and really make them feel special.
5	This is my favorite nail place to go! I would highly recommend it! The girls and guys are so nice and welcoming. They don't rush which is a huge plus.
5	Best nail place in Scottsdale. You won't be disappointed. Great service and very welcoming staff. It is also very clean and the chairs are great for relaxing.  A bargain for the prices that they charge.
5	Absolutely love this place! Always friendly and attentive service with high quality work. I never go anywhere else.
5	Excellent service. Friendly nail techs! Affordable and they did a nice job. It's a best kept secret in North Scottsdale.
5	Awesome service. Nails look great. I walked in and they were inviting and friendly instead of awkward like a lot of other nail salons. I would refer anyone to Emma's!
