1	I have gone in 3 times for 3 separate reasons trying to support a local "mom and pop" store. Each time the owner has just been rude. He acts like everything he does is a favor.  I am truly disappointed because I'd love to support another local business but he makes it just impossible. With a better attitude I'd do so much more business with him.
5	Quick service and knowledgable staff.  It's wonderful to support a small local business.  Many mailing options available and theres even a cute dog that greets you hello!
1	If you want to go somewhere where the people who are supposed to help you are just plain RUDE and evidently don't care if they get your business or not, this is the place for you!!!  Due to the fact that our family owns two small businesses, I try to shop at small businesses myself when I can.  It won't happen at this place again! Next time, I will make the decision to "go wait in the line at the post office" as the man at the store suggested to me earlier today.
