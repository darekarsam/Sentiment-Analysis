4	Pizza Up is a great lunch option that I don't think is getting the patronage it deserves.  Among all of the chains and restaurant options for lunch uptown, this place stands out - it's a no-frill, well-priced pizza shop.I've been here 3 times, and every time I've felt it was money well-spent. Here's the breakdown:For $7.99, you get an all-you-can-eat buffet with a drink. The buffet includes     Pizza - NY style, pretty darn good. Options seemed to vary from cheese to meat-lovers to mushroom,peppers and onions. Ohn and they did a buffalo chicken pizza that was delicious, too. My only complaint is that they could use heat lamps to keep pizza hot and the cheese melty.     Pasta - Nothing special. Penne with tomato sauce. And meatballs or sausage on the side (prefer meatballs definitely)     Salad - Actually, a pretty decent salad bar. No complaints hereMMMmmm we need more of these kind of lunch places uptown.  Otherwise, working here just seems stuffy
5	If you like NY style pizza, this place is awesome.  You really have to know it's there though.  There's usually a small sidewalk sign in front of the building - it's the same building on Tryon that has the Bojangles.  Go inside and it opens up into a larger space with more shops.It's all about the pizza for me.  I've been craving old school NY style pizza for a long time.  My first bite and that empty hole inside me was satisfied.  I'll definitely be coming back for more.
