4	So what I usually hit the H-H-M up for is body junk like lotion, scrubs, shampoos, soap.. that sort of thing. It's right across from the Wal-Mart parking lot (I also really appreciate how auto-correct doesn't know who Wal-Mart is) so if you are a Wally world regular, you have the opportunity to amp up your Eco-friendliness by slipping into here instead. The people are always super friendly and everything they have is well stocked.. It's wee-little store so I sometimes can't be too picky. It encourages me to use my investigatory skills for sure. Beer selection is nice and I just read a sign that they have wine tastings? Whaaat? Where's my planner?
3	I've been shopping at Home Economist - I mean, Healthy Home Market - on Independence for years. The parking lot may have potholes, the interior has a dingy, dated look -albeit not on purpose-, and it doesn't have a snazzy juice and coffee bar like the South Blvd store but it's the one closest to my house so it's the one I frequent. But this review isn't about the Independence HHM...Located next to Party City at the Galleria (on the opposite side of the parking lot from Walmart), this new HHM has a cramped feeling about it. Upon entrance there is a small juice/coffee bar to the left but there's so much signage (posters and such) that I was turned off from checking to see if they offer wheatgrass. Take four steps inside the store and you are at the cash registers. Yes, the same can be said about the other locations but at those HHMs the sliding doors don't open directly in front of the register area - they do here as there is only one entrance/exit (also different from the other CLT area stores).Although this space is new, clean, bright, and carries the same brands and products I've come to expect from HHM, I'm just not feeling it. Will give it another go though as it is a locally owned business that regularly supports and features local non-profits. One more thing. I was a little bummed this location's bulk goods section didn't have the crystallized ginger I usually buy at the Independence location.
3	Like others (apparently), I've been to the Home Economist/Healthy Home Market on Independence before - many times, in fact. Though I've been to the Super Wal-Mart here a few times, I generally try and avoid it because the parking lot gets nuts, but I figured I would check out the new store. I think I like the old one better.Though there are some decent items here that you can't get anywhere else - the space is just strange. It's like they tried to cram way too much into this space. Staff is friendly and all, but for everything they need, they are trying to do way too much in here and it just doesn't feel right. The vibe on Independence was way better, as funky as it was.
4	I have a love/hate thing going on with HHM.  I need them but sometimes I wish I didn't.  They do offer a ton of products that you will not find anywhere else (except Earth Fare and Whole foods but they aren't as conveniently located).  This is the perfect spot for anyone on a "special" diet:  gluten free, paleo, vegan, raw, etc.  Their prices are pretty high but so are all specialty food stores so that doesn't shock me.  They aren't any higher than Whole Foods for most items.  They sell local produce, eggs and meats but not in large quantities.  I find the produce tends to look a little wilted so I try to avoid it.The main reason I love this place is for their shakes!  They have fabulous smoothies that are made with organic ingredients and they have something for everyone.  I advise you try the strawberry shortcake protein shake.  It is made with almond milk, strawberries, bananas, honey and hemp protein.  It doesn't sound like much but it is awesome!!  They have several others depending on your dietary needs.  This smoothie is the one thing that keeps me coming back!The main reason I "hate" this place is the service is slower than molasses.  I think the staff literally hates when customers come in for smoothies and actually we called one girl out about it and she admitted that yes, they do hate to make them.  I have to plan on being in there for 15-20 minutes even if I am just getting a smoothie so forgetaboutit if you actually have a few items and you have to stand in line.  They are super, super slow no matter what part of the store you are in.... so that is the only brutal part and this prevents them from getting 5 stars.  HOWEVER, I'll still be back this Saturday:)
4	I love the Healthy Home Market...with lots of good organic choices for man and beast (they have a pretty good selection of dog and cat food).  I like their selection of herbal teas here and I am a fan of their bulk nuts and spices.  This particular store is a bit on the small side, and unfortunately, I didn't find everything at this store that I have found at the other HHM locations.  Still, overall I like the place,  so I am sure I will be back for the items that I can't find at Trader Joes or EarthFare.
4	Super place...nice selection of GF food products
4	I came here on 9/1/2013 (as soon as they opened) and I wanted to say customer service was EXCELLENT. After strolling around the store, it was refreshing to be in a smaller store to get what I need. Although this location is smaller, it was very well organized, clean and everything was accessible. Customer service was awesome as a one store attendant helped my bro-in-law with circulation issues with his feet and Micheal (Team Lead) was soooo awesome! It was very hot outside and he was so sweet to show me where to get water and even encouraged me to fill a water cup with ice to further cool me down. He was so nice and that made my experience even better. Also, they have a great travel section so if you want to try certain products before buying the larger size, this is a great thing. I bought the travel size crystal deodorant (which worked for me btw...lol). Also, their alkaline water is awesome too so check that out while your there.
1	I purchased a large bag of bulk Kosher Salt this past week. When I went to use the salt I noticed the texture was different. I tasted it and it was sweet. It seems that someone mixed sugar in with the salt. I called the store and was told that it was most likely a customer who decided they didn't want sugar and just threw it back in the wrong container. The employee seemed disinterested, bothered and had no sense of urgency. I was also told they would take care of it. That's all nothing else. No apology, no offer to bring the salt back, nothing. Well guess what? I'm now disinterested in the Healthy Home Market, I'm bothered by the lack of Cutomer Service and I feel no sense of urgency to go back.
3	This is like a mini whole foods market.The place is a little bit unorganized because I found same items in 3 different shelfs. Yes I'm talking about those gummy bears ! And other candy products. They do have great selections of organic,gluten free,vegan all natural products.Though since the place has limited space,it's likely you will bump into someone else's cart or edge of a table or shelf.
