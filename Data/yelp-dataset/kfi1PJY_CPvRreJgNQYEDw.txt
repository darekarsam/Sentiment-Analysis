4	Was supposed to go to piano bar but it was closed due to a Taylor hicks show. Stopped by here because the live band caught my attention. Such a fun little spot to lounge around (or dance) on the weekends. Minimum is 2 drinks to visit this spot. Servers are all lovely and nice. Why hasn't anyone reviewed this spot? So much fun!
5	What a beautiful place with great drinks and friendly, personal service. And the music was absolutely the best - "The Next Movement." They engaged with the audience and made the night very memorable. Their vocals are superb and they have a great repertoire. The audience was of all ages, dancing and having fun. No mention of a drink minimum, but "The Next Movement" kept me buying drinks and dancing to almost every song. What a gorgeous bar/lounge and top notch act.
5	This place was fabulous! The atmosphere was lively and the music was fabulous!The band played songs that made people want to dance and waitresses didn't bother you too much and force you to stick to the two drink minimum. We wished we had discovered this place sooner and had come here every night!Such a blast!
