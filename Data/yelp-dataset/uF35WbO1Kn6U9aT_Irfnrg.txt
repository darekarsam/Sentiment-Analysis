5	I've lived here for almost a year, and I never want to leave.  Not only is the location perfect for access to the light rail and all the great stuff downtown, the complex itself is awesome.  It is very quiet and peaceful with all the forest landscaping, and the office staff is great.

5	We've been here for a long time. Same day maintenance and repair, gated, forested (with a hiking trail on one side!), excellent and pleasant management, live security at night and location about 1/4 mile from light rail. Balconies are much larger than average. The area is quiet and a lot of the walls are solid cinder block construction. Before we moved here, I had never even heard of an apartment complex like this. It was expanded after the housing bust.....likely for former home owners who didn't like regular small, noisy apartments. This place has studios with large patios, going up to 3 bedroom apartments and patio homes. For the bigger places, there is usually a waiting list; we waited a few months for the place we wanted many years ago, but it was worth it. Pricing is reasonable by Phoenix standards. This place is actually nicer than the one family homes across the street, some of which I've been to due to friends. Places like this aren't built anymore. It's old but kept up very well by maintenance and lots of upgrades all the time. The maintenance guys, from the same country in Europe, have a great work ethic.(My profile says I live in Gilbert; I don't, I just have that there on reviews for privacy)
