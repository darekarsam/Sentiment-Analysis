5	Clean, safe, run by good people. I come here a few times a year to wash a king comforter that is too big for our washer. The experience is always good--the equipment works, the wash and dry times are fast, and the staff will offer to point you to the machines which are better for your needs. In one case, I was directed to a washer half as expensive as the one I had selected. There is also a small children's area, stocked with size-appropriate furniture, a TV with kids' videos, and four shelves of children's books to read.Said comforter took about 20 minutes to wash and another 20 to dry in their machines. My own washer would have taken at least an hour (had it been big enough in the first place to take a load that large), with my dryer taking close to an hour as well. The total cost was $7.50, a fraction of what a dry cleaner would have charged, and we would have needed a second trip, days later, to pick it up.If you need to find a place to get some laundry done, this is an excellent choice. Even if you aren't in Matthews, it is worth the drive.

The place is clean and has plenty of large machines that can accomodate your biggest laundry needs.  The employees are friendly and will help you if you are unsure of where to start. They also have a change machine in-house which makes things easier.  Also, if you are the lazy sort and don't want to do your own laundry, they have a drop off service where the employees will wash, dry and fold your clothes for you. Wow, who would have thought that you could still get full-service at the laundromat? :-)
