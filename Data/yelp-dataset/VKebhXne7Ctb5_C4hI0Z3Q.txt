5	One of the stylists, Linda, went out of her to accommodate a special family member. Without going into details and to protect ones privacy... She made her feel extra special for an amazing event.
5	Salon Iaomo is a wonderful little salon in Applebee's/Mad Mex plaza in Greentree Rd. I have been going to SI for a few years now and I always leave satisfied. Although they offer many services, tanning, extensions, they even have a wig room, I go for the basics, cut and color. Brian is the best but all of the staff are friendly, helpful and knowledgable about their craft. From my experience, the pricing is about average for this type of salon. Color and cut will run you 90$. This price has also stayed the same for several years. No recent price increases. If you are looking for a great salon with expert staff, the latest gossip mags and a variety of services, I recommend Salon Iaomo.
5	Full service hair salon with tanning beds.   They do everything from the basic cut to color, highlights, brazilian blowouts, extentions, hair replacement and wigs.  Always offer coffe/tea or water while i am waiting for my highlights to set.  No pressure for a rebook.  Check it out!!
