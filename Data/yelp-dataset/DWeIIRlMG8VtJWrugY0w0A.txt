4	I really love this place. I can always find unique shoes, handbags and jewelry. it's a good spot for those who don't like carrying a Coach or D&B bag like every other woman in Charlotte!
4	Nice  boutique with many unique finds.  If you want something nice and chic  this is the place to go.  I agree with the comment by Anita about wanting to carry a nice handbag that you won't see everywhere.  I got 4 compliments from random people on the shoes I bought there the very first day I wore them!  I will definately be a repeat customer!
3	Janix has (or had?) a cool selection of purses & hand-bags... but I went by this weekend and the store was empty.  I am not sure if they have closed or moved.  The website is still up... so maybe they are relocating.
