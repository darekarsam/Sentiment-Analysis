3	Yeah!  Tasty Mexican!  Modern decor and an old b/w movie being projected on the wall while we were there. Neat.  The menu is small, but you should be able to find something you like.    There were some fruity looking drinks being served in Mason Jars as well.  I was too chicken to ask what they were!  We were happy to be able to get out Mexican fix even in Montreal.
