4	Great little fruit store. Nice selection and very fair prices.
4	A great little fruit and veggie mart! I ducked in to pick up a few odds and ends I needed on my way by, lured in by the inexpensive produce, and was delighted to see how clean and tidy (and simple!) this store is. Smaller than some giant deps, there is produce, some grocery items, cheeses, meats, breads and some nuts and assorted other prepackaged bulk type items.  They have some really nice sausages, that were a bonus (I had only intended to pick up some produce). The staff are really friendly. I'll have to remember to stop here the next time I'm in the area and in need of some groceries.
