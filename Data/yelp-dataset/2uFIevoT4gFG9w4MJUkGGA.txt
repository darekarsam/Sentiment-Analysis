3	When I was a kid, I used to love the dollar stores. Why? Because it was so easy to convince mother to get me that 1-2 items I wanted since it was so cheap.This is a habit I still have not gotten out of my system. Go in for 2-3 things I need. Leave with 7-8.There's nothing special to note about this Dollarama other than the fact that the lunch lineups can be pretty epicly long.
1	Manque de service aux caisses ! Souvent plusieurs clients laissent leurs achats et s'en vont. Dommage puisque ce n'est pas le nombre d'employer qui manque
1	Do not shop here!  Very rude staff, yelled at me to pass in other aisle. she must of been too lazy to stand up for 1.4 seconds. does not matter if items are only $1, staff has no respect for its customers. Avoid at all costs as majority of items are NOT $1! Other stores such as Target have Party supplies on sale for $1 and much much better quality!
