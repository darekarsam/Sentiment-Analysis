3	Came in for a quick bite for lunch on Monday we were the only ones here and took a seat at the bar tables. We started with the Fried Mushrooms they were pretty good the ranch with them was good. I had a Hot dog with Sauerkraut and French Fries pretty good the roll was a little too much bread for me but it was ok. My sister had the Veggie Sandwich and she said it was pretty good it was really big! We also placed an order to go for our boss but that took forever it was just a grilled Chicken sandwich! So all in all it was pretty good bar food.
3	Nice bar... kinda empty... but then again I was there on a Wednesday night.  The regulars were out and about (so the bar was full).The hostess... also our waitress was very nice and seated us.  Didn't rush us while ordering and the food came out within reason and very good!The place was nice and definitely on my list for watering holes in Matthews.  It's tucked into a strip mall so it can be hard to miss.  I can see this place being packed on the weekends with two/three nice pool tables and plenty of standing room in the dining area/bar.
3	I have driven past this place numerous times on my way to New Zealand, and told myself every time I would have to go check it out. Well, last night was that night. We finally parked in front of it, and headed inside. The outside patio was nice, but kind of small. I always heard some type of music going on when we passed it, so that was part of the allure for me. Last night, we walked in and decided to sit inside and there was a gal playing piano and singing. It was very nice and unexpected. I really enjoyed her. A man greeted us as soon as we entered, and it wasn't too busy, but that didn't bother us any. We sat at a booth and had a couple drinks. They had some decent specials. We ordered some food, and it was ok. We probably would go back for some drinks on the patio, but not sure we'd eat there again.
