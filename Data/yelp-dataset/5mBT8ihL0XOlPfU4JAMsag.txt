2	Not sure if this is because the pharmacy is so busy all the time since it's in a great location, but I've experience some pretty long wait times and some pharmacists and technicians that seem to have no patience and a short fuse.I've only had one decent experience and that was at 8am when no one was in the store.  I'll try to go early in the morning more often. :(
4	The staff here is very friendly, I guess I am kind of a regular, I stop in about every other day and know most of the employees by name.  There are some long waits sometimes but I see past it because I am treated like a valued customer every time!
4	I moved over in this area around December 2012. It's a pretty good location, and it gets busy during the day. They have almost everything that you need for one of those "Crap I just ran out of paper towels" kind of days. The customer service is pretty average, so that's always a plus. I'll make sure to keep coming back!
