5	Drove down from Charlotte to pick up some Christmas gifts for my family. This place has everything you could want along with cheap prices and a lot of BOGO deals. The staff was friendly. They told us about which fireworks would give us the best "bang" for our buck and threw in some freebies during our checkout. I was sure I'd be spending $50 to get as much as I did, but came away under $30. I don't buy fireworks a lot, but next time I do, I will definitely be going to Davey Jones.
2	Seeing as though the 4th is coming up we went fireworks shopping. Davey Jones is conveniently located off Carowinds Blvd. There were definitely a lot of fireworks crammed into a pretty small space. The lighting wasn't the best. The store was fairly busy and the aisles seemed a little small with so many people. I'm no fireworks expert but they seemed to have a decent selection. Note: They have an $8 minimum on credit transactions. Annoying if you don't carry cash and have a small purchase.As we were driving away, we decided to stop in across I-77 at the Red Rocket Fireworks store. They had an item I bought over at Davey Jones Fireworks for HALF the price! Supposedly, Davey Jones has a lowest price guarantee... From their website: "we beat any price or it's free!" Well, I called about it and it doesn't really work like that... On the phone they said that I would have to come back in with the item and they would call the other store to investigate. Then they would refund the difference between prices. It isn't really worth the hassle for a few bucks (which is probably what they count on). Oh, and they don't offer any bonus/free items with purchase like Red Rocket did.
