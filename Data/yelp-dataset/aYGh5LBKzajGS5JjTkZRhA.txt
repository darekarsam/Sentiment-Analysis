3	So they are brand new and clearly unsure of what they are doing. No big deal they were friendly and trying to do the best they could. I ordered the buffalo chicken pita and had it customized because I didn't care of some of the suggested ingredients. The buffalo sauce has a hint of BBQ sauce taste and I hate the taste of BBQ. I ate about a quarter of it and had to be done. I got the berry berry smoothie which was delicious so I at least have that. I will try again just maybe something different next time.
5	This is the best pita I have ever had!The staff is friendly and the food is delicious.  Wish I could eat there every day.
5	So happy a healthy food alternative replaced a Cold Stone Creamery!!I tried this place for the first time a couple weeks ago when they just opened. Great friendly staff and great menu selections. I had the Local Pita - delish!Very happy there is a quick healthy to go food place close to home!!
1	I was excited to have a pita shop so close to home, however watching the cook heat up pre-cooked meat was not what I expected.   Watched the cook open the drawer under the cook top to retrieve the pre-cooked meat and then slam the drawer with his foot numerous times.  The chicken pita that I received tasted like pre-cooked boiled chicken.  For the price, I expected way more.  Wont be returning.
1	Holy balls!  What a shit show!  How about having an adult help run the place?!?  Let me preface this that I really, really wanted to like this place, being that it's so close to my house. I waited 25 minutes for two pitas.  The cook forgot my double meat, which I had already paid $2.00 for. They asked me if I had wanted double meat and I told them that that was what I had ordered. They told the cook to throw some more meat on the grill, but at that point I just wanted to get the F out of there. I told them to forget the extra meat and said that I just wanted to leave. The girl, obviously seeing that I was irritated, handed me my food, smirked at me and said "Have a great day!".As for the food, it was ok. All processed meats. I probably could've made it at home.
4	Me and my cousin were in the plaza and saw pita pit and thought we give it a try I ordered the dagwood and she ordered the philly steak the food was goodThe lady there didn't seem to understand us very well Overall everything was good will be back
1	***attention manager**** your employees are going to make someone very sick!!!!!!***attention manager****someone should let the employees know that wearing gloves doesn't keep food clean when they use the same gloves to take money from customers.  i really hope you're not training these employees to do this. it's disgusting and dangerous.***attention manager**** your employees are going to make someone very sick!!!!!!***attention manager****
4	Service was very slow, but food was fun and portions were great. This felt like a subway for Pitas and it was awesome! Seriously though, super slow....
1	I was pretty excited when I saw a Pita Pit in the parking lot on Power and Ray. I used to go to the one on mill during my ASU days, so I was all but forced by my inner will to forego Chipotle for Pita Pit.Maybe it was because it's Labor Day, but the lights were super dim, the two girls were sitting down eating, and if I didn't know better, the place looked closed.The food was okay. It was pre cooked meat. The girl didn't know how to make my sandwich, I had to tell her what goes on it. I just don't remember the one on Mill being this bad...In general, I may give it another shot, but I won't skip my Chipotle fix again.
1	This was the most flavorless pita I have ever had.  To top it off I asked for RED ONION and the person gave me ROASTED RED PEPPERS.  I even asked again if he added onion and he said yes.  Uh boy...$10 later and I didn't even eat 1/2 of it.  Too expensive to waste my money on tire tread gyro sandwiches.
1	Stopped in finally after my vegetarian wife insisted we try it.   Picked up two Falafel pitas per the girls suggestion for a first timer.  My wife wasn't present.   To go please.  Sat down and waited.  Another employee walked in and started talking to her.   A bit later she came out with two pita''s clearly not ready to walk out the door.  Simple said these were to go and she turned around and walked back.  5 minutes later she walked over again with the two sandwich and no bag.  Asked politely if she had a bag and she said yes, would you like one?  I decided to wait at the counter because she clearly kept loosing focus.  Handed me my food and I left.   My wife's initial response.  Was this made today???  Yuck.   Head out to Chipotle honey.I just guessing that this place has potential but lacks management to watch over this place until they get some good employees..  Said we really need healthy options in this area.
