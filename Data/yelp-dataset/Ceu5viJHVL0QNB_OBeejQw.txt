4	All natural and organic awesomeness! This place is conveniently located on the same corner as Padre Murphy's. I finally decided to check it out and was totally surprised at the variety of stuff for sale in there. I was basically thinking it would be like a tiny GNC or something, but it was a lot more. I found Himalayan Pink Salt for cooking exactly what I went in there for! Not only did they have good cooking staples but they also had cleaning supplies, beauty products, and any supplement you could think of. Its good to know I dont have to make a special trip to Whole Foods just  to pick up some salt and shampoo! YAY!
5	Love this little gem. It's right next to myGym and WAY cheaper than the big vitamin stores. Service is always friends and quick. Hope they stay in business!!
