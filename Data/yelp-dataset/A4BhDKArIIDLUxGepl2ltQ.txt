2	$15 for 2 pretzels & 2 small drinks (kid sized drinks)........ did I wander into the movie theater on accident? LOL! The pretzels are ok, but not AWESOME in my opinion. In a fix when I need something & don't want to face the food court, I have been known to pay for the luxury of not facing the crowds. It's an option :)The pretzel place shares a counter with Mrs Fields Cookies, so just veer off to the side towards the 3 little tables just inside & you will see the sign.
3	Every time we go to the Apple store my kid returns the favor of dragging him along by dragging me to get him a pretzel here.  It is a bit pricey and they always have a very slow moving line, but the product is generally fresh and tasty.
3	Friendly staff, they offer mall employes deals!. The pretzels are defiantly better when hot. When they cool they turn unto stone.
4	What can you say about this location, it's much like any of the others.  Wetzel's has one of the best pretzels on the planet, and because they are consistent, I've never found one location to be different from the others.  Service is quick and they are always hot and fresh.
3	Went to the mall for a movie and dinner, but I wasn't very hungry so we went to Wetzel's Pretzels for a snack. I got the Wetzel Bitz with cheddar cheese sauce. There were a lot in there and they were big! Very soft and yummy. Ran out of cheese sauce before they were gone. I also tried a couple of the new Wetzel Dog Bites that my boyfriend ordered. They were ok, although I was a little thrown that the inside of the wiener was 2 different colors. Like pinkish in the middle and dark brown toward the outside. Not sure if they are all beef but it didn't taste like it to me. But I love a good, buttery, soft pretzel!
