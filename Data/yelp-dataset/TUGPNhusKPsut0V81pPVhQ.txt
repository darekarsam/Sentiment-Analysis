4	Always great customer service at the Pharmacy. Nice sales, good selection and a Drive-Thru for drugs, who could ask for anything more! ;O)

1	Pharmacy Nightmare!!! Doctor called in a prescription on Sunday around noon that was needed ASAP. We showed up to the pharmacy to see the pharmacy was closed normal operating hours. The script was on the pharmacys voicemail and no one could access it to transfer it. Then had to get the Dr. to call in another script. Ever try to track your Dr. down on Sunday?  It took hours. This is my last trip to Walgreens ever. When I needed them the most; they let me down.
