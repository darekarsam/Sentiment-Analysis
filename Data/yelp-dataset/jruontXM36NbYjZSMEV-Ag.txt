5	Comfortable place and professional staff. Dr Heath even does acupuncture.  I like this place and always get the best massage.
5	My husband and I have been seeing Dr Heath for years.  I have seen many chiropractors over the last 30 years and consider him one of the best. I was involved in a car accident as a teenager and have had back issues ever since. I know if I have back pain now I can get relief when I see him. I would recommend you try him too.
5	I was sent here by my husband. Great chiro, would absolutely recommend.Easy to make appointments, and awesome results. Treatments have significantly helped me.
