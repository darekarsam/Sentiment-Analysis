3	Friendly enough and good service. Menu is OK but not very exciting. Interesting to see Nepalese dishes, though these ate not super exciting. A good local "curry house"? Definitely.
4	We needed something quick to eat before the cinema & so we thought we'd give this a try.The service was efficient & the food was really tasty. I had the chicken dhansak and it was one of the best I've had in ages. If you're in the area it is worth checking out.
