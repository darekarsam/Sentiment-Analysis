3	Wetzels Pretzels are delicous! I love them! Although i would appreciate if they made some improvements like the price range. Seriously?, A plain pretzel for seriously 3.99? I think that is a horrible price. Im pretty sure a plain pretzel are other particpating stores are like $1.50, So its pretty obvious to me where i would go. Cheap OR Expensive.
3	A bit over priced for a pretzel (3.70) that was hard. I expected it be better then Auntie Annie's Pretzels (nation wide) or Pretzelmaker (Hawaii). The hot cheese dipping sauce didn't tats like real cheese either. The plus side of this location is the employees are polite and patient. The restaurant is clean and presentable. It gives no health hazards flags here. Overall the 3stars are for the food an 5 Stars for the employees. Ok place to go.
2	Pricey, of course it is in a mall on Las Vegas Blvd. Price might be excusable if their product was great but it's not. I had a pretzel dog. The hot dog was OK but the pretzel part was staleish- as in a little dry and too chewy.  Definitely not Auntie Annie quality. The service was fine - quick and pleasant.
