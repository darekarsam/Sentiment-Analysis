1	Dairy Queen is over priced to begin with. I wanted a plain cone but wanted it in a cup and I just found out that it costs extra to do that. It was $3:50 for a plain ice cream. My advice is to walk to the closest store and buy a tub of ice cream for that money. oh, I should mention that the ice cream was partially melted. I understand it was a hot and therefore a busy day, but $3.50 for a melted ice cream.. now that's highway robbery!
1	I had heard abt there so called BLIZZARD but was very disappointed with the taste or   Flavor or I would say was that an nice cream
5	Gotta speak up against all the haters- how can ice cream ever be less than 4 stars?DQ is a Canadian staple, always consistently yummy and reasonably priced, unlike all those poser boutique ice creameries in the oh-too-hip cities.I'll take a Chocolate dipped softserve cone  any day!
5	I don't understand people complaining about the price. That's the price. It's the same for any 4 season ice cream shop. They obviously haven't been to Bilboquet before. Anywho, the five stars is for customer service. I'm not a huge sweets person but it's a beautiful/hot day out and I'm biking around. I told the cashier (Doug) and he helped me pick out something good and simple. I asked for it to be something that wouldn't melt seeing as I still had to eat my Lafleur lunch before moving on to the creamy delicacy so he even offered to let me pay in advance (to skip the lunch rush) and that he'd make it on the spot once I was done my lunch. GO DOUG!!
