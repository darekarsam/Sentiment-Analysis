5	Laser away is awesome!
5	Always had such great service. I highly recommend this location and there staff.
5	LaserAway provides a pretty good service to remove hair permanently, in my case - from for the facial area. It works. Before, I tried the service of another organization to achieve the same purpose, the girl applied a small metal plate to my skin there, I wasted time & money for about 20 appointments there without any result.LaserAway uses different technology: a kind of pencil with electrical current with stream of air. Fortunately, 90% of the hair (beard & mustache areas) does not grow anymore. 10% of the most stubborn hair are still there, but become thin. Hope, the last 3 procedures will have removed them forever also.
5	Service is great
5	I feel very comfortable with the staff, equipment, and procedure. I'm on number three of a tattoo removal, I'm happy!
5	Great service and results
5	My experience at Laser Away is always positive. The nurses are experienced, thorough, and I always feel comfortable during treatments. Scheduling has gotten progressively better over the years I've been using Laser Away and now I only experience on-time appointments. The treatments are effective, but you have to commit to the treatments and be prepared to purchase another round of treatments for permanent hair removal and probably some periodic follow-up treatments. The investment is worth it.
