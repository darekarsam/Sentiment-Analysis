5	I needed a master link to an obscure x ring chain, I called around to 10 different shops, got nowhere. These guys got it for me the next day and one of them met me to save me a trip from Mesa, all for a 10 dollar part. I for one appreciate that kind of service!
1	Drove 35 miles to go to this shop with my vintage 1978xr75 because it was not running.  Said I needed a valve job 375.00 I said ok 3 weeks later said for a 100.00 he would tune the carb I said ok.  I picked my bike up in pouring rain took it home and put it away 2 months later I took it to my race at wild horse pass sputtered and ran way worse than when I took it in.  I looked at the manifoldAnd it had silicone all over the manifold?  It died as it did before I took it in?  Called the owner and he said 30 day warranty!  I said wouldn't you even want to see what is wrong he said no dont you understand 30day warranty.  I was like wow what a retard he must know something about my motorcycle and is not telling me?  Never tell a paying customer no don't come back I was thinking at that point to call him to show me the valves he said he changed or did he?  I have been in retail 35yrs and currently run two national franchise automotive service centers and would say stay clear of this guys place hope this helps someone!!  What a tool!
1	These guys wasted my time, and couldn't accomplish ordering a coolant house for my quad.  I orderd it and was FORCED to prepay for it 8 days ago.  I was assured it would be there 5 days from when they charged my credit card-which was right away.  Here we are 7 days later and they just have excuses, no coolant house.  I thought going through this place might be easier and convenient since they are local, but I was wrong.  Besides, they just order the part from the Yamaha dealer in Mesa, I can do that myself(although I need to give them cc# over the phone to do it).  I will be ordering the house rocky mountain atv.
