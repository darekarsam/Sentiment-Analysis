3	Prices here are what you would expect from a College bookstore- high, but they do have pretty much everything you may need, from meds to pencils and calculators, snacks, and shirts, notebooks and even magazines and used, low priced movies. Books are what they are- expensive.The only issue I have with this place is the fricken lines. Why are we constantly changing the way the lines work here? One semester the line is over there, the next semester it is on the other side of the room, and forced behind the book shelves so anyone just coming in cannot see it. Stop being so Bipolar with the lines!Other than that, it is a pretty decent place, and the return policies are pretty cool.
1	Horrible customer service. Dont waste your time and go someplace else and.save money.
5	I had a great experience here ..had to buy one book and rent another. It's my first semester, so it was my first time. They were super helpful in the back and at the register, and answered all of my questions.
