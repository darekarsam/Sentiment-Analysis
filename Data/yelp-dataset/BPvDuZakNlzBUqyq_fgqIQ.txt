3	I have to admit, a student should not be visiting casinos. However, as years go by, a student starts to wonder if the casino would be a good place to make money. However, sadly, it is not till after visiting that you discover that actually it is not a good place to make money!However, apart from that, Circus Casino in the Fountain Park complex is good fun! It has many gambling games for you to win and lose money. Roulette, poker, blackjack and coin machines are all available. I really only play roulette and have learnt the frustrations of the game!You have to get membership to visit and recently the price has lowered. When inside it has a restaurant which always looks dead and empty. It also has a bar which charges outrageous prices for drinks.You could spend hours in here, but as a student I would advise you to limit you stay!

A few lucky rolls at roulette and you're James Bond, ten minutes later, you're walking home in the rain, angry, depressed, and having lost every last penny in your account.Whilst most casino punters are drunk, it's when visiting sober that the cold callousness of the system really hits you. The draining of colour from an addict's face as his chips, and next month's mortgage payments disappear is counteracted by dead-eyed indifference on the part of the croupier. Not always pleasant, but fascinating.Still. if you know your limits and treat it more as entertainment than a means of making money, you'll have a riot.
