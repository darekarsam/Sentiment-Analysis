4	VIBE I was told that this is the place to go when at the Jean Talon market. I was not disappointed! I ATEIt is all about the maple sugar pie. Two words: sugar coma! Two more words: worth it. There's tons of goodies here but the mini pie was a perfect snack (in between all the other snacking and sugar shacking I was doing that weekend!)OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK It will bring back memories of your mother, if she made any type of sugar pie.
5	This place is tiny, but what they manage to crank out of here is nothing short of a miracle. The staff is sweet, helpful and fun and I'd have to say this is my most favourite spot in all of Jean Talon Market. My personal favourite is the pecan pie: OMFG: Quebec maple, fresh pecans throughout and the flakiest, yummiest pastry on the planet (sorry mum, but theirs is the best I have EVER had.)
4	Known as the Pie and Quiche place at the front part of the Marche.  This place consists of two glass display cabinets stocked up with various quiches and fruit pies with muffins and other baking delights. Also cookies and the real deal (what I come here for) Sugar pies.  The Sugar pie you can get with pecans or without usually $12.95 and they are just divine!  What a Sugar pie should taste like and can serve a hungry dinner table to satisfying delight!  I haven't tried the quiches as my wife makes them well but they look amazingly good as well!  A great pace to fill the need for dinner or dessert and many things in between!
4	Cute little pit-stop if you have time to visit...you MUST try the maple pies - I will be ordering them for overnight delivery to be sure. They have a space at the Jean Talon Market in Montreal, so there's no excuse not to visit!!
