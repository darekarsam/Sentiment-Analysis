1	Took an hour to get one pizza!! Rude staff  n I wasnt the only one that was told 10 more min and waited 30
1	I,m from New York this is not pizza!
5	Everyone was so nice! Great customer service!
1	Staff was cool. Pizza was not. Seemed like it was over cooked, hardly any cheese on it, and tasted tough. will go somewhere else next time.
1	Order took over 1 hour to deliver. Pizza was cold and tasted stale. Asked for refund, manager is an idiot. DO NOT GO HERE!
2	I used to live in New York, and I can say with confidence that Pizza Hut on the East Coast is loads better in quality than PH on the West. Regardless, I have definitely had better pizza in general than any Pizza Hut in the US, anyways, so this review is going to be more about the service. Service: 2 - Feeling lazy one Saturday night, we ordered our Pizza online with some garlic sauce to boot. They ended up calling about 2 minutes after we sent the order to make sure that we actually ordered. If they're going to do that, they should just get rid of online ordering and prompt everyone to make a phone call! It would be much easier on their end.When we arrived at the time that they said it would be ready over the phone, the pizza was ~not~ ready. They continued to state while we were waiting that the "real reason" they called was because they were out of garlic sauce...then why didn't you mention that over the phone? Another 8-10 minutes later, we had a pizza to take home!Poor organization and failure to make a pick-up deadline for a just-okay pizza. Service is slow and confusing--better avoid! Happy food hunting :)
1	Ordered the special 2 med for 6.99 each. 1 was supposed to be half olive and half cheese. They put olives on all of it. Asked them to just do the 2nd pizza. Charged me $12 for 1 medium pizza. No thank you. I'll take my business to someone who can make what I order. The entire time they were looking at each other confused. Rude people.
