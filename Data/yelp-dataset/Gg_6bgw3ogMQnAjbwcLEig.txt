4	I had to take my boys to get their hair cut for a funeral this week.  I love Daphne's bakery and noticed there was a barber shop beside their bakery so I chose this particular barber shop.  There were like 6 men and at first I felt awkward going into the shop.  However, the gentlemen were very nice and made me feel right at home.  The only downside is that they did not take credit cards - only cash or check (neither of which I had on me at the time).  They were very kind and trusted/allowed me to run to the nearest bank branch to withdraw money in which to pay them.  They were very quick and did a great job with my boys.  They can expect a return visit from us.  I was very satisfied!!!!
4	I like this place. Every time I go there's usually 5 or 6 barbers so I never have to wait long. Friendly staff. They all do a great job. I like Stephen to cut my hair. Hair cut is $15 but I usu just give a $20.
4	Had my first visit to the Mint Hill Barber Shop today. This locally owned establishment did not disappoint. I'd met the owner, Stephen, at a Mint Hill Chamber event and I had been looking for a new place to get a trim. I walked in today with no wait. Bruce cut my hair. He was friendly and professional. I love my hair, so when I try a new place, I'm nervous. When he was done and I had said some prayers (I was not facing the mirror so I didn't know what the cut looked like until he was finished) I was pleased. The real judge was my wife. She said it was the best hair cut I'd had in years! If that wasn't good enough, the price was just 15 bucks. You can't beat that in this economy.
5	Amazing barber shop! After years of SportsClips and Great Clips because of their after work hours, I'll be rearranging my schedule to come back.Clippers to start, scissor finish and straight razor neck. Came on a recommendation and was well worth it.
