5	These guys know what they are talking about.  I have been hearing their ads on the radio and saw the boards around town so I thought I would give it a try.  I knew as a diabetic  I had some ED issues but I had no idea how much I had lost.  These guys got me all fixed up and have saved my marriage I can not say how grateful we are.  If you are a man reading this do yourself a favor and go see them and get yourself right too!
5	This was the most comfortable experience I had discussing my sexual health with a Physician. All the staff was very professional and made me feel very comfortable in every aspect. I received so much information along with answers that I never got from anywhere else I have ever been. They offer so much for the sexual health of a man. I couldnt be more happy with my treatment. Now that my testosterone levels are where they should be, I feel like a million bucks!  Im lifting more weight and my stamina is unbelieveable.. Numale, you Rock!!
5	I wanted to say thank you to NuMale Medical Center and the staff that took care of me when I visited NuMale in November. The treatments are working great, my relationship is restored and everything works like I am 25 years old again!  Very professional experience!Brian T.
