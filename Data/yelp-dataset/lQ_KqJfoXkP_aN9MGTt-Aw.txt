4	I recently had the opportunity to play here as a guest.  It was a good experience.The first thing I noticed is the practice facilities, of course.  The driving range was nice, with some nice firm grass to hit from.  Nothing worse than going to a driving range and hitting from bare ground.The course itself is traditional, with large trees lining the fairways, and reasonably distributed hazards.  Everything was in great condition; dead patches were rare.  Best of all, the greens were smooth and fast.The most interesting thing about this course is its location right on the edge of Mesa's eponymous geographic feature.  There are a few elevated tees, one hole with a steep decline 200 yards off the tee, and a few holes where you are hitting up a steep incline to the green.The facilities seemed nice, and the staff and members seemed friendly enough.  Just be careful getting in and out of the parking lot; several holes have you hitting over the road.
5	We had our Wedding Ceremony and Reception at Mesa Country Club on November 10th, 2012. We got married on the 10th tee box, had the cocktail hour on the patio outside, and moved indoors for the reception. It was absolutely amazing! The food was delicious, as we received many compliments from our guests. The wedding coordinator, was GREAT! She was very accommodating, helpful and did not miss a single detail. If you are looking for a classy, yet affordable wedding venue, Mesa Country Club is the place!
