3	This Walmart is pretty good. I got everything I needed and upon checking my receipt I noticed I was overcharged for something. So I went to customer service and let them know. I told the rep and she was very rude. No apology for the inconvenience. Operator # 00007651. I hate when people can't separate there hate for there job, from there job!
1	This walmart may carry everything under the sun, but let me tell you about the hair I found on my sliced deli meats. This guy gave me a sample with hair on it. When I told him he just smiled. Thanks walmart for continuing to suck!
1	I'm less impressed with the way this place is run every time I have to visit.  Today I went in to find  a training collar for our puppy,  and to my dismay,  all of the collars were in a maniacal pile below where they should be hanging,  like a twisted cloth and metal trash heap.  Is it bad management or lazy employees?  SOMEBODY isn't paying attention.  The self check outs are always having problems,  and they should all take cards AND Cash.
4	I been to this Walmart a million times. What I like is the fact that they slice cheese and other goodies. They will give u FREE samples :) I'm still doing the cabbage patch and dancing around because I had free samples of cheese and turkey. The bakery is clean and all the employees are super kind. This Walmart has sure improved with in the last year. I no longer live in Henderson I live in Las Vegas but its worth the drive to come here. Oh and no long lines they have more then 3 cashiers... hmmmm I like the new changes that have been made to this store.
1	Wow ! Day after Xmas and only 4 regular registers open. Lines are at least 20 deep. This is why I hate coming to Walmart
