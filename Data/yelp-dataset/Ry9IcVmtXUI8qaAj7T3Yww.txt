5	This place is great it is difficult to see but its a great place to go for any man. You can definitely get lost in here in a good way. They have lots of different stuff to check out not only do they have Guns, Ammo. They have fireworks, some military surplus IE.. Ammo cans, backpacks, and military tents. And they also have gunsmithing available as well. and last but not least the have mining equipment and live bait. Its a pretty cool idea for a store almost everything a man could want in one place. The staff was super friendly and helpful I ended up buying 2 Very nice pistols one totally custom built. I ended up finding it because I used to work at the nursery that occupied the building before and I was very glad that I found my way in there.. I will defiantly be back..
5	These are great guys here at FOB.  The specialize in all sorts of prepping items, even gold mining equipment!  They have guns, ammo, targets, safes, gear, and they specialize in building AR15's.  They love what they do and they are very helpful.  The place used to be a nursery and the building outside isn't dressed up yet but the inside is pretty nice with lots of good stuff if you are in to that kind of think.  If you are a gun guy I highly recommend you stopping by and at least checking things out.  They are on the North side of Bell at around 20th avenue (cant remember but there is a street light at the corner).  Ask them to show you a pistol AR...they are pretty nice too.
5	These guys are great! From sales to specialty gunsmithing these are the go to guys! Great information and unlike a lot of shops the FOB will teach and inform you instead of judging you or turning you away. Anything theses guys do or sell they stand behind. Great shop, great people!
