5	Great family owned water store! The specialty ice is awesome because its shaved ice, thrifty ice cream, and any flavors you want. I do the vanilla ice cream and hawaiian flavor, its so good.

There is normally a table on the inside to sit but has been moved outside to take advantage of the cool Arizona winters. They also have a great selection of candy there with a few old throw back that you will shed a tear if you are in your 30's or above. I have been here about 10 times and with a mixture of candy and ice cream I cant seem to ever spend above $5 which is a welcome sight now a days. If you want some ice cream or shaved ice and are located near Queen Creek I suggest that you pay this small shop a visit.
4	Appreciate the convenience, just wish the customer service was better
