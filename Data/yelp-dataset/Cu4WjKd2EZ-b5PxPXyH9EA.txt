4	I never had any kind of Asian or chines kind of food .One Saturday we walked around in the mall and they gave out samples and I fell in love with Kato's chicken and they gave you two big sides ,lots of food .The food is reasonably priced.
4	I was walking around the mall Christmas shopping when I was struck with a sudden hunger.  While walking around trying to decide where to eat a nice gentleman with a sample tray walked up to me and had me try one of every sample they had.After sampling the Orange chicken, the teriyaki chicken and the bourbon chicken I decided to get a triple entree meal from Kato's.It was delicious, and they did not skimp on portion sizes like some places o it was mounded on my plate and was freshly made.the only complaint would be that the fried rice was rather bland and flavorless.
3	I too was served a toothpick with a hunk of chicken on it at the mall.  I decided to order the bourbon chicken to go.  The flavor of the chicken was really good.  The price is average for what you get.  I had the vegetables instead of the rice and they were good once you put some soy sauce on them.  The chicken is hunks of chicken and not mutilated pieces like some of the other mall chicken on a stick places.
1	I felt compelled to write an update on my latest visit.  The chicken was awful! It had a funny taste to it.  I can't seem to put my finger on it.  It did not taste like chicken nor did it look like chicken.  I felt it was way overpriced for what I got.  I will avoid from now on.
