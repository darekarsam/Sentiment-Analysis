4	Solar Nails is a new nail salon by the Green Valley Library. It is nicely painted inside; you can tell a little thought went into the interior design. There are only a couple of those cheesy French manicure posters up as opposed to the splatters of generic nail prints you find in other places. But my biggest praise for this particular is the cute little girl who does the most amazing nail art. I went in on my lunch break to get a quick pedi, and I usually just go to chill in a massage chair and get my feet bubbly. This was not the case however. I wish I knew her name, but she was the tiniest thing, and she decided to go all out on my toes. We decided on "The Thrill of Brazil" red, and then she asked if I wanted a flower. I never get flowers or anything like that, but she convinced me. I don't know how, but she was a damn good salesman. So I thought I would get the typical dot-dot-daisy (you know what I mean, right?) but instead, I came out with a Georgia O'Keafe replica on my big toe. Ok, that's a bit of an overstatement, but honestly, why is this girl doing nails? She could be painting the next Renoir! Anyway, I have finally found my pedicure palace, and my very own polish princess...
5	I come here once a month to get my nails done.  While Friday evenings and Saturdays are impossible to get in on, I've never had to wait longer then 30 minutes.It's tucked away at the end of a strip mall, but such a great find!
1	New owners.  Won't be going back. :(
