5	Howdy!Some restaurants are destination restaurants, others are worthwhile eating at if you're in the neighborhood. After having a Michigo with onions (a pogo covered with Michigan sauce and onions) I am seriously contemplating moving to Verdun so that I do not have to hike across God's half acre in order to eat there. It is is better than a destination restaurant, I wish it was my kitchen.
