1	An hour late, no call at all.  Called vendor when appointment time passed, no response.  Did not do business with them.  The next day the sales person (Grant) emailed me repeatedly to tell me he didn't know what time the appointment was and to argue that expecting a call from them or for them to be on time was an unreasonable expectation.
