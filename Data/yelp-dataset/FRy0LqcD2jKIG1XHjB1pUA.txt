1	**Summary**       - What is it? - You're given an hour to escape a room with your friends. There are clues all over the room and puzzles to solve. They give you one "free hint" to use.       - Decor - I was expecting detailed "room escape" scenes I've seen from pictures in Hong Kong or Japan. Rather, it seemed like a dirty, dilapidated office space that has been cheaply renovated. It reminds me of a couple years back when I was looking through foreclosed houses.       - Air Conditioning - I cannot stress how hot it was. When we got there, they said they just turned on the A/C, but it was uncomfortably hot the whole time.        - Price - The sign behind the counter said it was $15 a room an hour per person with $3 extra if you need more time. They had a new room open, so we tried that. However, they then said it'd be $20 per person and there'd be a charge for credit cards. Since it only was a little, we figured it'd be ok. However, after an hour, rather than ask for $3, they asked for $20 extra per person for more time. When I asked about the sign behind the counter, the response I got was, "We can take the sign down if you want."       - Puzzles - Though some of the puzzles were nice, a lot of the puzzles seemed less about figuring stuff out but more about making giant leaps in guessing. I believe this is to necessitate you using your "free hint" or being stuck for a good chunk of the hour.       - Professionalism - The level of professionalism seemed on par with a haunted house you'd see middle school students put together in a class room vs an actual legitimate business. The randomly changing of rules to milk the customers of more money seems to support this.**Price**       - Advertised on the sign: $15 a room for an hour per person. $3 for more time.       - What they made us pay: $20 cash only per person. $20 for more time.       - They also informed us that next week, the prices were going to go up.**Recommendations**       - I wouldn't recommend this place. I actually thought this was "Live Room Escape" which got phenomenal reviews, but this is just a cheap knock-off.
4	Basic concept : You're locked in a room with your group and you're given clues to solve puzzles that will ultimately help you find a key to escape. Super fun! It was pretty hot in the room, but we were working so hard to solve the clues that we didn't really notice. The company just started in May, so it seems that they're still working out the kinks (decor, broken items, etc) but the experience was SO interesting, innovative, and fun!We did the Under the Table scene, and we had to get more time (you're allotted 45 minutes). We'll be back for sure to play the other scenes!
5	Well-thought-out, well-themed puzzles. The production is minimal, but what the rooms lack in production they make up for in challenge and originality. I've done all four of his currently available rooms and I was impressed with each of them.Some require more lateral thinking; some more logic. All require at least some combination of both, but none require special skills. Highly recommend to any people that are a fan of puzzles!
4	I purchased the Groupon and my room was White Lie.   The place is a converted office building on the second floor of a strip mall.  The game started on time with just myself and my wife and were really locked in a room. Actually there is an emergency exit so you can really exit the room if you need to because the main door is locked from the outside!.  The game was intense. My room was pitch black and we were given flashlights and walkie-talkies to call staff members in when we needed hints. We were definitely given more than one hint for no extra charge. When our time ran out, we paid a few extra bucks and finally was able to get out of the room.  They just opened a few months ago so I agree, with the fact that they need to put some more work in remodeling the place but for now, it was definitely worth it.  Word of advice, plan on staying awhile. We had dinner reservations and was distracted with the time and tried to rush through the ending.   Stay focused and you'll have a lot of fun. There were some scary parts of my room so be prepared!
3	My group has done every room at this place. As Arthur L mentioned in his review, this is not as sophisticated as its HK or Japan counterparts. A room in a foreclosed home is a spot-on description of what you can expect. Not much air conditioning just like most Asian businesses. Don't expect a physically comfortable or visually entertaining experience. I remember my main motivation to solve the room was to get the hell out of there because it was so hot and uncomfortable lolThe game itself is not bad, however. They put some thoughts into constructing a background story to help you conceptualize the situation. Most of the puzzles require some creative thinking, but nothing a high school level student can't figure out. In fact, the rule of KISS definitely applies in this game. Your group will have fun figuring out these puzzles together and laugh afterwards about you missed an obvious clue. My recommendation is to have no more than 3 people in a room. 4 is pushing it, and 5 is definitely too many.
4	***NOTE: there are NO SPOILERS in this review***I've been wanting to do a room escape since I heard about it months ago. I'm now eagerly seeking another one in the area because this was so much fun.Admittedly, I was a bit apprehensive to the point of almost being disappointed when we entered the business and our puzzle room, but that all changed very quickly. The other reviews mentioned how warm the place was & the stairwell to Live Game Escape was pretty warm. However, when we entered the room for White Lie, it was downright chilly. That was such a relief considering the temperature outside was creeping up on 110 degrees.The puzzles inside were well thought out. At no time did we have that "How was I supposed to figure THAT out?" feeling. I'm not saying that the puzzles were easy, just that they were logical.Afterwards, my boyfriend commented that they did a great job of recreating an escape the room game in live form & I'd have to agree. They also did a good job in weaving a story into the puzzle, so you don't feel like you're just looking for the next clue.The staff was very helpful and friendly. The place could use a bit more of an investment in decor & furniture inside the puzzle & in the waiting area.
5	This was my first time playing a live game like this and it's so much fun! Gave me chills along the way and I couldn't wait for the next step in solving the mysteries.  The staff is super kind and friendly.  My friends and I will definitely come back here again.
5	This Escape the Room game is exciting and very well crafted. Amazing puzzles. We did Under the Table and Farewell. We escaped from the more difficult Under the Table and did not escape from the easier Farewell. Regardless both were well crafted and we will be returning.
4	We went on Monday, and had a blast. Yes, it was alittle warm for my wife and sister, but the fan made it tolerable. The young man that checked us in was great. Very helpful and obvious enjoyed what he was doing. Even though we didn't solve the room, we had a great time. Don't expect a glamorous building or interior, but hey, you are here for the puzzle. We will be back for another room!
5	The owner was out of sight. Me and my girl walked in he showed us around and then helped us with details.The room we picked was white lie. It was fantastic ..The puzzles was sweet...I will be back :) thank you for the great time.
1	I feel bad giving this place one star, especially when so many people liked it.  First of all, I asked the person if it would be scary and she said no, it would not be.  Well that is fine and dandy until they put me into a dark room and then at one point something literally fell on top of me (as part of the game).  That scared the poop out of me!Also, I thought that it would be more problem solving, but it was just a series of locks that led to keys that led to more locks and the only thing you had to figure out was what numbers to use.  We had trouble getting the right numbers lined up because each lock was different and it was hard to see with the flashlights.  Stupid obstacles like that took the fun out of actually "solving" the riddle.
5	I have been chatting with someone on their Facebook page and he was the most accommodating person I have ever met. He was willing to open Christmas Day for my group but we opted for Christmas Eve - even though they are supposed to be closed. The best customer service I have ever received from an establishment!! Seriously a MUST TRY!
3	This place is fun and the staff is very friendly.  It's better if the room was sound proof and more isolated. We could hear people from the other maze.   It's $30 per person which is overpriced for my taste.  If it was $15 per person then I'd give it five stars because you are given on 45 minutes for $30.  If we were given an hour or another room to solve that would be worth $30 to me :). Finally, production can be a lot better.  #justsayin
