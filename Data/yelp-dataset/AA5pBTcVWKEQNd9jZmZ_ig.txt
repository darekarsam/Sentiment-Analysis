4	They do a great job for kids birthday parties.  We had the girls party there this weekend at 10am.  Kids wore pajamas and had a blast.  Tons of art projects followed by sprinkle donuts.  Good value and super easy!
4	My 5 year old attended art camp here with a friend.  It was a 3 hour camp and when I realized it was only 4 days instead of 5, the value of this camp sharply decreased... oh!  but wait a minute... they released a coupon for pay for one child and the second goes free!  Score!  This only worked for me because I had not paid for our session yet.  Had I already paid, this deal would not have applied.  Imagine how disappointed my responsible, early-paying friend was when she realized the offer was not available to her!The camp itself was well run and organized.  The art work was adorable.  My daughter had a great time and did not get too messy!  They also gave them fun snacks.The camp is advertised for up to age 10 but my "free" 10 year old only went twice as it is really geared toward the younger children.
