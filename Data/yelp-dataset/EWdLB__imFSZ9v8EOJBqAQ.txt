3	Great customer service! Everyone was friendly and very helpful. Kiosks clog the entry way, you feel like you are in everyones way using them. The food tasted average and the presentation was less than but delivered to the table. They are high priced and the pastries were less to be desired, for a Sunday morning. Overall OK!
3	Clean dining area. Friendly efficient staff good food served fresh. I look forward to trying more menu items in the future. Decent prices. Food is cooked to order.
5	There is absolutely nothing wrong or not delicious at this recently opened establishment. I've tried several items off their menu (pastries, cookies, sandwiches) and sampled their range of coffee in the short time they've been open and found everything delicious. Friendly customer centric staff, an immaculate atmosphere thats warm and inviting. I couldn't be more pleased to locate such a great place, fairly close to home, to write my novels. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
1	As you walk in the order Kiosks are too close to the door and you walk right into people trying to order or people are walking into you as you order, bit akward, I don't suggest using them. The food was somewhat bland and a little overpriced for the quantity you get. There was fast and friendly service and the place was very clean. If you are hungry and you love to eat be prepared to drop a lot of cash!
4	Great soups, great sandwiches, nice people, clean place hopefully they can keep it clean since the area is not so good!
