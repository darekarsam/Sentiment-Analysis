5	John DeRosa was an amazing DJ! We spoke with him before the wedding, gave him an idea of the music we wanted and he hit it perfectly! I would HIGHLY recommend him! If we ever need a DJ in Vegas again - he is our guy! THANK YOU!
5	We hired Bruno productions for our wedding reception... All I can say is wow.... John did an amazing job. We were so happy with his work and all of our guests were telling us how much they enjoyed his music.... We would recommend Bruno productions to anyone who is looking for a DJ! Thanks again JohnMr & Mrs Kiers :-)
5	We hired DJ John D for our Wedding a couple of years back in Las Vegas. We where living in San Diego at the time and planned everything for our event from there. He was so professional and amazing! Everything was so seamless and effortless. The day of the wedding, everything went off without a hitch. I was VERY sick with a stomach virus and John worked so well with us on moving things around (song wise) and changing all the plans to accommodate for me being sick. Everyone had a lot of fun. I was so impressed with how quickly he came up with a whole new Line up and game plan because of my illness. It really made my day that much special. I was so happy to not have to stress about anything (other then being sick). Also, Being Hispanic, I wanted some specific songs played. When he didnt locate them on his music logs he just asked me to send them over! It was great! I sent him the song I wanted and he found them. My Godfather Wrote special song for my Grandmother that I wanted played as my Father Daughter song and I sent him the File with the Song and he played it. He really made the day so special for me. Really Highly recommend John D. Great pricing, Very professional and Very accommodating!
