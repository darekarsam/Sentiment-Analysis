5	DEFINITELY A 5 STAR EXPERIENCE!!I have been using Danielle's services for almost a year and its always perfection. She comes early to set up, stays late to clean properly and is fantastic with all guests and staff. Our events have 50-150 peeps. Can't go wrong!
5	I had a bartender for my Sunday football get together with a bunch of my friends. Bryn the bartender was super energetic and added to the energy of the party, not to mention she was super cute. She also thought of some creative new drinks for the girls. I have tried other bartending services, but Raise the Bar definitely exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend them for your next party and I will be using them again.
5	I hired Raise the Bar for my holiday party a couple weeks ago and they were great!!! Brittany the bartender was such a trooper!  She wore a Santa hat and even made the kids root beer floats. She also brought a menu with three different and delicious drinks for our guests. That made it really fun because they were all Christmas themed. I have used another company in the past, but Raise the Bar blew them away!  It was very reasonably priced and the service was excellent.  I will definitely use and recommend this company for future events!
