5	Jimmy D with Starz Entertainment did a fantastic job providing us DJ services for our wedding and reception. Jimmy D has a great and well-deserved reputation in the DJ community. We are lucky we were able to hire him to DJ our wedding and reception. He has many years of experience and it shows. He was energetic and super professional in every aspect of the planning and execution of our wedding and reception. He answered our emails immediately and met with us several times before the wedding to make sure we had everything set up the way we wanted. He spent hours before and after, setting up to make sure the lighting and sound was the best it could be. He had great suggestions for songs and activities and helped make our wedding and reception absolutely perfect. It was seamless, and everyone had a great time! We highly, highly, recommend Jimmy D and Starz Entertainment for DJ services!
5	Jimmy D is the best DJ that you will find in Arizona! I attended a wedding that he DJed and he did such a great job that I booked him when I got married 4 years later! He gets everyone up and dancing, there wasn't a single person in the room who wasn't dancing once Jimmy opened the dance floor! He is so fun, charismatic, and extremely professional. I highly recommend anyone who is looking for someone to entertain guests of all ages, who can control the energy of the room, and who is easy and delightful to work with!
5	Jimmy did an absolute amazing job as our wedding DJ. It's the only wedding I have ever seen where the dance floor was PACKED all night long. Not only was his playlist amazing, his ability to keep everything organized and on track was very key. We actually didn't have a wedding planner, and without Jimmy there to basically run the show, I'm not sure what we would've done. His assistant Carie was awesome as well. She played a really key role in keeping everything up to speed and organized. We would highly recommend Jimmy and Starz Entertainment!  SUPER IMPRESSED!!!!!
