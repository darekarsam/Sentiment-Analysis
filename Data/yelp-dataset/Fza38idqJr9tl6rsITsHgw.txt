5	This location recently opened which has me excited as I love to shop at this store. As a career woman The Limited sells quality clothes that are tailored well and last for years. You can find this store right across from BCBG on the main level 1E.The new location is  very organized and well stocked. Plenty of inventory for all sizes that are in order to help you identify your correct size. The manager and the sales rep really worked the floor. I was in the store for the 1st time yesterday and they were pretty busy. They handled the floor of traffic professionally and were very helpful. As soon as I walked in the door I was greeted and the sales were mentioned to me. Once I had merchandise I was asked if I needed a fitting room along with my name. After that I was referenced by my name during the remainder of my shopping experience. As I found a selection of items I liked I headed to the register. Though one person ahead of me I was still addressed by the sales rep that she would be right with me. My purchase was wrapped neatly with tissue paper and placed in a cute bag.The Limited mails coupons regularly so be sure to provide your email address. I also get them in the regular mail. Be sure to look over the receipt as surveys can be done to save an additional $10.00 if you spend $50.00 or more. Student discounts are granted if you show your student I.D. non sales items.
