5	Dbat is the country's premiere indoor baseball and softball practice facility with world class instruction.  This facility is brand new as if March 2014.   Beautiful facility and friendly owners.
3	This is a nice enough facility but man is it expensive. What happened to the days of $5 batting cage sessions? So you have to pay $80something a month for a membership fee and then on top of that you still have to pay for any lessons, camps, and clinics. For $80something I better get ALL of that included in the price. I guess if you can afford to pay that much for instruction from former "MLB" players, more power to you, just wish there was an alternative for the working stiff who just wants to help his kid become a better ball player.
5	Visited here earlier today...1st rate clean facility! No signs of wear and tear anywhere. Equipment all in good shape. Enjoyed my time here today. Was the only customer here this morning when they opened and it was very relaxing. 1st rate batting cage...don't think I've ever seen better yet.
