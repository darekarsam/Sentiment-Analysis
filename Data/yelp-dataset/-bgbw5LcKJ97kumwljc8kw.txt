5	They are doing an awesome job for cheap, and really fast. If you take the special, you got the inside, and outside of the car clean plus some polish on your wheels for around 16$. It's been the second time I went there, and I wasn't disappointed.
5	This place is awesome!I have a small SUV and they charged me $18 for in/out + armor-all. I asked to vacuum the rear part and to wash the plastic baggage tray and they did it for $2 extra. For $20 including tax, this is an excelent and fast service! One thing though, they don't accept credit cards so bring cash or interact.
5	hand wash inside and out, plus wax and rubber armor, for only 18 bulks taxes in. excellent
5	This car wash is amazing. Very professional employees.I tried a lot of others, and Auto Spa is the one that got the best price/quality ratio.
5	I was worried about the quality for the price but when I showed up every other person there was a Porsche owner who had clearly been there before so I couldn't really get too protective of my little Mini. Yes they may be slow if they are backed up. It's like three guys that really care and that means it's not at speed. They take appointments for big stuff (shampoo the whole car, etc) and otherwise just do an amazing job for less than $20.
5	I'm new to this area and my car needed a good washing. The employees were very nice and very professional. When I arrived I was six cars back and they told me it would be an hour and fifteen minutes of so. Since I wasn't in a hurry, I waited, mainly because they gave me a heads up on the time frame. But they got me in did a great job on just the outside of my car (I only wanted that) and was happy to drive away have only spent $14.00. I will be back for a full detail.
