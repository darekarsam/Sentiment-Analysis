3	This is a typical McDonald's.  There was no wait at the drive thru which was nice.  They got our order right which is always a bonus.Any soft drink is $1 so you might as well get the large.  At the McDonald's at home drinks are only $1 on the weekends.  All other days they are regular price.Fries were good which is important.  McDonald's makes the best fries in my opinion so I'm always bummed if I get a bad batch (soggy, not salted, too salty).
3	Food is good, generally fresh and staff is always pleasant.  However, recently I have had two issues with my order being inaccurate when I ordered through the drive thru.  They seem to try to rush you through without verifying the order.  Overall the place is not bad.  But double check your order before you pull away.  Unfortunately customers have to do the staff's job.
