1	Old fish = sick. Can someone explain this to the people here? Please. Twice this horrible pain and bloating within 30 minutes of lunch. Twice. Run for your life!
4	Placed an order for delivery 2 weeks ago.The lady on the phone was very polite, and had a smile in her voice.Ordered Tuna nigiriSalmon nigiriRising sunThe aiko special rollFried scallop roll with mint and pickled radish Crunchy tuna and crunchy salmon tartar in a rice paper with lettuce And they offered us a dragon roll and I believe a couple extra pieces of the fried scallop roll.At the exception of the aiko special roll that did not do any sparks for me, Everything was perfect! The fish was good and the rice as well. Our sushi were really awsome. The delivery was quick, and both phone host and delivery guy were kind and polite. I appreciated the special attention to offer us a couple pieces for having a good order.The sauces were delightfull, even the soy sauce which I would love to know what kind it is for it was better with a slightly sweeter taste and less dark than regular soy sauce.We enjoyed a lovely fresh sushi diner with a good homemade mango cilantro salad and a great cold white wine on the house patio with a beautiful sunset and views of the mont royal. Thank you Aiko sushi for adding a delicious souvenir to my life :)
1	one word, it s not good, it's not sushis! I can cook better sushis by myself!
5	Ordered from here at least 10 or 12 times and only once was it a little underwhelming... Every other time, the sushi has been absolutely fantastic! I highly recommend the Nizakama, it's by far my favorite. I haven't found any other sushi I've liked as much as what I've had from Aiko.
