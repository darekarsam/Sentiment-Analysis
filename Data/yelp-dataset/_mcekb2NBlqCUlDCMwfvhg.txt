5	Awesome, beautiful place to live!  Totally recommend!
5	If you are looking for apartments in Ahwatukee, I would definitely recommend Liv Ahwatukee.  The staff is so nice and helpful.  I would give them a call to be put on the list for when they open this summer!
1	***Fake reviewers/employees have left 3 5-Star Reviews (Mike, Robin, and Marjon), they left similar comments for LIV Avenida, LIV North Scottsdale and LIV Northgate, notice that the comments are from 8 months ago before the property was opened... Nice try! Be aware of this and the deception!!!***
