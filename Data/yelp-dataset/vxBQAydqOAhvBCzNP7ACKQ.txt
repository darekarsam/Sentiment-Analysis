1	Visited this store yesterday and was greeted by a hateful old woman who seemed annoyed by the fact that my friend and I were even in the store.  She later informed me, in a very rude way, that I was not allowed to photograph a mirror on the wall.  When I asked her why, she refused to tell me.  When I told her I was an antiques dealer who could potentially be sending business her way, she referred to antiques as "old crappy junk".  This store, Jerry Kitman's, mind you, is FILLED with outdated, TACKY, ugly black and white plastic garbage that looks like 1985 puked all over the place.  In a recession economy, I don't know how this lady can afford to be so nasty and rude to people who walk in the doors of her store.  AVOID THIS HORRIBLE PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE.
1	I agree with the reviews online about this store.  I went in to look for some furniture for my home.  The awful woman there looked me up and down and determined that I was not able to afford anything based upon my appearance.  It was winter and I had on boots, etc.  I do not wear my wealth on my person.  I could afford anything in the store, but would not buy anything there.  Not to mention the store has huge fans running to combat the mold and musty odor there.  No one wants furniture that smells.  Stay away from this store.
1	I walked into the store today with my son and niece and was probably greeted by the rudest woman in retail history. As  glared at me like I was homeless I asked her what the problem was. She then called the police on me... Not kidding. She is out of her mind do not spend your money there.
