5	A great shopper is to shop around. The price, services especially about quality. When I lived in Henderson, NV area in 2005 to 2011, I found Sal's Taylor's and Dry Cleanse near to my house. They had the best prices for dry cleaning & laundry.  If you want to do Taylor they do very excellence quality. You can't find a mistake on your clothes. I've been taking my clothes there for 6 years and I am constantly pleased with the good service, low prices and excellence quality.  Right I move to Santa Ana, CA but I still sent my nice clothes to do Taylor over there because I can't find one like them. It a little price to send to them but I believe they do it right.  I will never do anywhere else because they always get my order right and take care of my clothes!
5	Words can not describe how amazing my experience was with this place. There are two things I always look for;  quality work, and quality service. This lady far exceeded my expectations. I came to her with a very oversized suit jacket that was assigned to me by my new employer and was to be tailored by my first day, which was two days from when they gave it it me!! I checked multiple alteration locations and nobody would take the job because they were all loaded with work being that Christmas is in a few days. This lady was clearly very loaded with work, but sympathized with my situation and took on the challenge. I was worried that with her having to rush through it, the quality would not be that great, but I was very wrong. My suit looks like it was tailored by god himself!  Quality service? Couldn't be better!
