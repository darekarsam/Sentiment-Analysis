5	I was referred here by a friend and it was a great suggestion.  The entire office is friendly, patient, and well-informed.  Dr. Gailey educated me on many things and answered all my questions patiently and thoroughly.  I didn't get any extractions done but the hygenist got me for a deep cleaning on one side of my mouth.  She was great.  Gentle, patient and she knows her job.  There was minimal pain; she used some type of rub-on anesthetic that did ok.  10,000,000 times better than any needles.They brought me back for a check-up and was just as informative.They seem flexible with insurances and the prices were really good.  I have absolutely no complaints or problems with anything here.  Awesome office and dentist!
5	I would recommend Gateway Family Dentistry to anyone! They are friendly, easy to make appointment (email/online/by voicemail). The receptionist will get right back to you if you email her or leave a message. They sent me a Thank you Card and Thank you Email. The office goes the extra mile for you to feel appreciated... and I appreciate that! Dr. Gailey also fitted me for a retainer. He does it all. Sedation dentistry is amazing. 5 fillings and a deep cleaning- no memory of the entire event. Its the best thing ever (since i was tramatized as a child). It had been years since I went and I was amazed AMAZED *AmAZeD* at their level of service. I will never go anywhere else.If you are thinking about changing Dentists, I recommend Dr. Gailey. You will not be disappointed.
5	Dr. Gailey and his associates are so caring, kind and helpful.  I was in dire need of a root canal and he took me in quickly and alleviated the problem.  The entire office staff has always treated me with thoughtfulness and respect.  I highly recommend this office to anyone in need of a dentist or hygienist.
