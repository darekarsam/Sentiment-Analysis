4	This place use to be called Tiffany's (check there for reviews). First time here the epitome of five dinner. I'm in freaking love!
5	Best hole in the wall you've ever been to.  #1 coffee in Las Vegas!  Hands down is the most classic diner experience you'll ever have!
5	we used to have our lunch delivered from ther old owners and it was mediocre at best.    now that vickie took the place over ... the food is 1o times better and the diner has never looked better.  super daily specials and great friendly service.  reminds me of a good old fashioned jersey diner!    go there and be happy!
5	The best hole in the wall old Vegas diner. Not many people know about this place. It's hard to tell from outside that there is a diner here. I've been coming here for years. Great food at very decent prices. My favorite is the ribeye dinner or ribeye breakfast. The BLT is good too. It's open 24/7. It's a hidden gem.
4	Used to be Tiffany's. This place had pretty good food but not too many vegetarian options and definitely no vegan options. My friend got the greek salad and was very happy with it. The veggie omelete was really good. Even the grilled cheese was awesome. Only complaint was that it was very crowded and a short staff so it was quite a wait to get our check. Very nice service however.
