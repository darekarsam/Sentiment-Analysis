5	I have used Avis on Baum for years an they are great! The location is so convenient for me and the people working there are really good.  They are so down to earth and really try to do their best to be accommodating. I haven't owned a car in 8 years and it is so convenient to be able to walk or bike somewhere to rent a car when I need to go visit family.
5	The couple that runs it is super nice. I've rented from them half a dozen times, and each time there's a car ready to go. Once I forgot to return on time, and Angelo called me to remind me...a good thing, because otherwise I would've forgotten.
