5	This store really caught my eye when I was walking through the mall and searching for various items.  I liked how the store featured both smaller items and bigger bedroom sets, plus online options for future purchase.  I felt like it was a mini IKEA with lots of kids bedroom decor.
1	We seen the web Paige for pigsty as we were looking for a bunk bed for my daughter, that's all she wanted for her 7th birthday, she didn't ask for any tos or anything else just a bunk bed. When we went to the store in superstition springs mall everything went very well, the people were very helpful and pleasant to work with, we payed for the bunk bed and to have it delivered and were told it would be at our house the next week. While we were driving home they called us and told us it was back ordered and it would be 3 weeks before we would get it, not a problem for it would still get here before the birthday. 4 weeks later we called them for we had still not heard anything and were told the earliest we might possibly get the bed would be 6-8 weeks more, this whole time the bed is showing in stock on their web page. When I called back they tried to get us to take a much more cheaply built bed which even the sales man in the store agreed with us in the store did not even look safe on the steps. I decided I would just get my money back and go else where but even that took 3 weeks, only took them 15 seconds to get my money yet it took them 3 weeks and some very unpleasant time on the phone with a manager to get my money back.   We found a better bed on the Internet for almost $300.00 less. Take my advise and go else where before you have the same headache and a seven year olds broken heart to deal with.
