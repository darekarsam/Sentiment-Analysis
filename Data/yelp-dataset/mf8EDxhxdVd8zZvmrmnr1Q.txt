3	I went to RC and she was nice and helpful, paid little over $150  hope I didn't over pay. But I needed a resume by a profesional cause I haven't been out of work in 15yrs and my old resume wasn't getting any calls. I'm going to pick it up today and start the search with my new profesionally written resume. I will update this review in the next couple of weeks to let you all know how it goes. Feeling optimistic !! 3 stars for now since I've had a bit of a problem with them calling me back about pick up appnt  I did find a job on my own for now, but not my target work. So hope this resume does the trick.
5	Ok so I am updating my review because since January I didn't look for work. But end of march I put my resume out on Monster, Indeed and few other websites because the place I was working was a joke and miserable. And to my delight my Resume written by RC at AAA resume got hits right away from interested employers I started interviewing and I also walked it in some auto dealerships old school like. 2 weeks later I am working at my new job auto industry doing exactly what I wanted. RC took my over 14 yrs of office work experience and made me very attractive to employers. I had 5 interviews in 1 week and am still getting employers calling but I'm so happy with my new job I won't be going anywhere. Good pay + benefits happy co-workers. And lots of compliments on my beautiful resume. Thanks RC and staff.
1	Wow, this place is a COMPLETE SCAM & please don't waste your time here. Talk about SUBSTANDARD SERVICE & A BUSINESS WHO ONLY CARES ABOUT COLLECTING MONEY!  I rarely even leave reviews but my experience was SO AWFUL & UNPROFESSIONAL with such HORRIBLE & UNPROFESSIONAL service I felt I had to let others know not to waste their money here..    The owner claims to have years of experience & done thousands of resumes, but all your time in the beginning in spent with her assistant, as she simply introduced herself & disappeared for the entire 2 hours that my initial appt ended up running.  They insist you need a more fancy resume package once they have you in their so-called executive office space which is one tiny room actually. They then lead you to believe their pricing will be reasonable, as their are several options.  BUT OF COURSE, THERE IS THE ONE VERSION they claim "most people go with & really works best." Although all of their 3 resume choices all will still run around $300 for your resume & cover letter basically & that's without any rush additional fees, now seeing how they REALLY WORK when I returned for my 2nd appt; I realized they probably just plug your details into their "READY TO GO" resume templates they keep saved for usually every position & THEN just hand it off to the customer as a true quality "Professionally Done" Resume that just cost you around $300.    This place is more about selling ad-on services TRYING TO SQUEEZE EVERY DOLLAR THEY CAN FROM PEOPLE REALLY LOOKING FOR QUALITY HELP & squeezing as many customers as possible per day.  TRULY ONE OF THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL BUSINESSES I HAVE DEALT WITH IN LAS VEGAS THE LAST 17 YEARS HERE.  Also, the first consult I came in for, they insisted of 65% of the total price being paid up front, right then & only by check or cash.. CAN YOU SAY MAJOR RED FLAG???65% up front BEFORE they THEY EVEN begin to do a single thing? THANK GOD, I didn't have that amount in cash on me & was told to bring it in the office when was set up for my next appt & didn't get taken for $150+ dollars! THE NIGHTMARE JUST GOT WORSE & WORSE attempting to work with Arsenia "RC" Pitts & her "assistant" was more like the sales closer at one of those time-share SCAM OPERATIONS. They operate out of a 225 SQ FT Executive Office/Shared office space which dozen's of different companies share one larger office with multiple small offices. Located off Sahara & Rainbow, which probably should have been the first major sign, if the so-called business can't afford more then $250 a month in rent for their offices, especially when their average resume package EACH RUNS AROUND $280-$300, if they DONT CON YOU INTO MORE THINGS YOU REALLY HAVE ***NO NEED FOR.***   Horrible when they try to EVEN SQUEEZE YOU FOR MORE MONEY & sell u on more garbage cheesy looking & just folding very bssic business cards with an outline of your resume instead.  BEST PART IS I WAS QUOTED I BELIEVE $250 FOR ONLY 250 CARDS, when I can go into any printer & have a 1000 made for $55-$75 max! TALK ABOUT A STRAIGHT SCAMMER.  After came in for my initial consult, it was all downhill from there,  Scheduling me for my 2nd appointment days in advance where I have a 25 min average drive each way, I showed up to find out they decided to book another appointment SEVERAL DAYS AFTER ME & NEVER NOTIFYING ME ONCE.  THE ENTIRE REASON I WAS SCHEDULED FOR THAT SPECIFIC day was because her assistant, I believe Heather who is just as much of a scammer; suggested waiting a few extra days even after I explained the urgency, so I could take the afternoon appt & allow "RC" TO SPEND  A COUPLE HOURS WITH NO INTERRUPTIONS with me.  Mainly due to my extensive job history & important details that were to be included.  Basically even called a few min before my appt time to let them know I was running a little behind with the random rain & flooding.  Instead of telling me then on the phone that they decided to book another appt days after mine, AFTER THEY CONFIRMED ME SEVERAL TIMES FOR THAT ORIGINAL DAY JUST TO HAVE UNINTERRUPTED TIME WITH THE ACTUAL RESUME WRITER, which was going to cut my time by more then half now.  THEY JUST CONFIRMED THEY ARE A TYPICAL SCAM BUSINESS, TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF UNKNOWING OR PEOPLE SIMPLY NOT PROPERLY INFORMED..I believe In Karma & will leave these rip-off artists & scammers FROM AAA RESUME WRITING in god's hands.  JUST DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN SLEEP AT NIGHT, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF INNOCENT PEOPLE EITHER TRYING TO IMPROVE THEIR CAREERS / JOBS, ALONG WITH UNEMPLOYEED PEOPLE.  With many of these people prob spending the last of their money on your so-called services. AAA RESUME WRITING are BY FAR the most expensive & OVERRATED SERVICE. THEIR ONLY PRIORITY HERE IS COLLECTING MONEY & SQUEEING IN EVERY CUSTOMER THEY CAN, WHENEVER THEY CAN, REGARDLESS OF PRIOR CLIENT COMMITMENTS, PROMISES, ETC..Tried giving them the benefit of my doubt, but my instincts WERE EXACTLY ON POINT. TRASH SERVICE
5	Great service all around. My resume is getting way more than the zero hits that I usually get, and I'm loving it!  The girls inside were friendly, and helpful.  I recommend everyone to go here.
5	Exceptional service due to the 30+ years of experience of the team at AAA Resume & Writing Services!  Within in 2 days I had a completely revamped resume and am now hunting down a salary north of 100k.I am newly 25 and came in with a pretty sturdy resume; however, after the team enhanced basically every part of the resume I felt very fortunate to have walked into 'AAA'.  My resume seemed to jump off the page and 'WoW' me like it never had before.  The thought - "I can't believe I've done this much stuff' actually came out of my mouth.  My previous resume seemed to be a story of what I had done.  My new resume was who I am today and what I can do for you tomorrow.  My resume is now PERFECT, every word, every bullet, every experience, and every job is perfectly placed and worded!  And when I say it is PERFECT I mean it.  'AAA' was even able to express my traits which I would never have thought possible on a resume but they did it.  My resume is now a work of art and I would be more than willing to recommend 'AAA' to anyone in need of confidence boost before a job hunt. I never had a problem getting job interviews with my old resume so I am extremely excited to get my professional resume in the hands of the top executives and start improving my financial situation.  Thanks RC and AAA
