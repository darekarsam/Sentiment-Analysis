5	I initially contacted Harvest Design Group and Todd directly after a large construction firm totally botched a patch and resurface of a deck on my investment condo. To call their work incompetent is too generous. The large firm made a mess of the surface, laying out roofing felt and tar and making a disaster of the whole project. At first I was concerned that my needs were too small of a project for Harvest Design, but after speaking with Todd he assured me he could help. Not only did his group remove the disaster that was the large firm's work he totally sealed and resurfaced the deck with appropriate matching color. It looks better than it did new. Todd's attention to detail on a project even as small as this speaks volumes to his firm's work ethic and perfection. HIGHLY recommended although at first I was thinking of not writing a review to keep this tradesman all to myself. If you need any sort of work I recommend contacting Harvest Design Group...if they don't specialize in your area they'll give a good recommendation of who does. Hire this firm only if you want reasonably priced great work. Otherwise go spend your dough on some Wal-Mart of construction companies and endure the pain.
1	I was really looking forward to meeting with this firm because their designs and reviews were spectacular. Unfortunately they never even called me to schedule an appointment. I tried for weeks to get them to come out and give me an estimate for a bid but Todd stopped emailing me 3 weeks ago and seems to have forgotten that I was a prospective client with a whole backyard redo pending. This does not inspire confidence for being able to reach them once your project is underway. It's a real shame because their designs on their website are stunning. Oh well.
