3	Large, clean supermarket.  Seems to cater to the latin crowd.  I think prices a little less then supermarket chains.
4	I've been on a mad hunt for Horchata. Even though Don Jose's site says that a variety of grocers carry their product, they don't. Not in Scottsdale anyway.However, I finally got the courage to go to this Food City. I've been to Phoenix Food City locations in the past, and they have all been really gross. Dirty floors, awful smells (like feces), rude employees/customers.NOT THIS ONE! The store is clean, and smells like a grocery store should. AND! They have almost an entire refrigerator section dedicated to Horchata. Their cashiers are super friendly, and the customers are nice too.The parking lot is huge, and I've always been able to get a spot practically inside the store.I think Albertson's has a better price for this Horchata, but the only one I've been to that actually carries it is in Phoenix, and it'd still be cheaper at Food City when I calculated the gas it takes to get there.
4	Have liked this market since it opened. To this person it has some character and not quite as cookie cutter as some. People always helpful. More of a family atmosphere. Some very good values.
