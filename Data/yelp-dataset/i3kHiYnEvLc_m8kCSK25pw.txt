5	Dr. Quach is the new doctor at this location, and wow is she awesome!!!  Took a lot of time with me and answered all my questions and concerns. The front office staff is also top rate.  They have a vision plan if you are uninsured that makes eyecare very affordable.  I highly recommend this location and this Dr.
5	Such friendly and helpful staff! Admittedly, I was "that annoying customer" who came in looking for new frames ten minutes before closing time. They neither rushed me nor made me feel like an inconvenience. In fact, I feel like they went out of their way to make conversation with me. I will definitely be returning.
5	I had heard from friends that Lasik was "the best decision they ever made," but I really didn't understand that until I got it myself. I hated wearing contacts, and life without them is so much more comfortable!I had an excellent experience with QualSight Lasik Nationwide in Phoenix. The doctor and medical support staff were supportive and understanding of my apprehension, and made sure I was as comfortable and ready as possible. The whole procedure was done in a flash. I was surprised how fast they got me out of there. I also appreciate how thorough the staff at Nationwide were in explaining the costs of each kind of Lasik procedure, and giving me all the information I needed to make the best choice for my eyes. Now, I have better vision than I ever did with contacts. Lasik actually made my vision 20/15. I have recommended Lasik, as well as Nationwide, to my friends. If you go for it, I hope you're as happy with it as I was!
1	The assistant manager Lindzy was rude and stated we were late for our appointment. I clarified with her the time that we were scheduled.  She insisted she was correct. I came into the store the day before to make the appointment and was sure of the time. She continued to insist I was incorrect. I cancelled my appointment due to her attitude.
