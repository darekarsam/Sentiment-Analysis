4	Banana cupcake (no nuts) the cupcake was so moist! I wish I lived in vegas, I'd definitely go back! My boyfriend got the strawberry cupcake, it was decent but the banana cupcake was delicious!!
4	Delicious cupcakes for such a good price! The truck also offers tasty refreshments. Great service as well. Wish I could find a way to track them down online... Anyone know if they have Twitter or Facebook?
5	I found Cheryl on Yelp of course because I wanted cupcakes for my wedding; and frankly all the other bakeries here in town just pile on the frosting which i think masks the flavor. She came out to meet with me and I  tasted many flavors. I fell in love and placed my wedding orderThe cupcakes are so moist and perfect. My guests  and husband loved them all Will definitely use her again and again. Thank you Cheryl for making my wedding perfect. :)
5	Ordered some cupcakes for my boss's birthday and they were a hit! I did the mini cupcakes so we could get a couple different flavors. I chose Oreo, red velvet and banana nut and they were all amazing! The minis are a one bite kinda thing, so plan accordingly! It's the perfect cupcake to frosting ratio. Some cupcakes are just a huge pile of nasty icing on a bland cupcake.  Not the case with Bake My Day! These were perfect! The owner is very nice. She was super helpful when it came to choosing flavors. I love that they deliver! Will definitely order again in the future. Looking forward to trying the pumpkin flavor this fall!
