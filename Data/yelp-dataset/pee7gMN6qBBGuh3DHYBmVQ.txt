5	I live in a development at the bottom of South Mountain and about twice a year the scorpions come off the mountain and in to my house to stay warm or cool. They have a mission to live in my home and sting/and or terrorize me and my dog.Scorpions are my least favorite of all the anthropods.. Picture a scary creature that glows under a blacklight, has eight legs, crab like pinchers and a stinging tail.. I can't stand them. I sprayed last May and that lasted until this month. Then I saw 4 in one week. The deal breaker was when the dog alerted me to one crawling on the bedroom wall. I gave up and started calling around.I called several companies (Orkin, Terminex, Rid ect) and found that they are all very expensive... they all wanted to lock me in to a one or two year contract and the cost was more than $400. My current economic situation being what it is, I only wanted a one time spray. It is much cheaper to have them come out when the scorpions show up, than to pay for year round treatment. And I have no other problems (knock on wood) no crickets, ants roaches, nothing.I had used Stanley before and still had their card so I gave them a ring. They came out the next day and sprayed my house down like it was on fire, I mean they drenched it. Standard service right? So why 5 stars? The guy that came out was AWESOME. Then I remembered why I liked him so much the first time. Not only did he spray my house, but he took me out back and walked me around to show me where I had a termite tunnel, then her showed me my breakers where the termite company certification was so I could call them and have them come out and treat my house (FOR FREE). He was informative and friendly and very affordable. I would recommend Stanley to anyone. I haven't seen one of those evil scorpions since.
5	Mark is great! We've been using him for two years after using another service and we have been critter free. He's super attentive and very knowledgable. I highly recommend him.
