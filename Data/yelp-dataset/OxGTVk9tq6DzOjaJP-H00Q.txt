5	The people that work at this Autozone are awesome! I needed a headlight for my Honda and I wasn't sure if it was going to be difficult to replace. The manager replaced it himself for me. I truly appreciated the help. I have been to this location a couple times and they are not pushy and don't sell you stuff you don't need! I highly recommend this Autozone.
5	Great service, took the time to check my car battery and inform that it could be recharged, unlike O'Riellys who wanted to sell me a $120 battery
4	I went in with issues on my 98 Jeep Cherokee and I was helped out immediately. Although we didn't find an immediate answer they worked with me for a good amount of time and got the answer in the end. All in all pretty happy with the customer service and knowledge at this store.
5	I was left in a pickle when I left the light on inside my car overnight (silly me).The car wouldn't star, and I knew it was the battery due to the light draining it. I got my car jumped, and headed over to AutoZone.I was helped immediately. The gentleman who helped me (didn't catch his name) was phenomenal! He tested my battery and advised that it was dead and couldn't be recharged. Boo.I bought a new battery and added the 5 year warranty and a few other little things to stop corrosion near the battery. He gave me a discount, which was awesome!We then went outside and I watched him remove the battery (he made it look easy compared to the two hours I spent just trying to get one of the connecters off) and install the new one. He explained battery basics to me and how to keep make it last longer.All in all, AutoZone is more like AutoHeaven to a car-illiterate person like me. Thanks AutoZone!
