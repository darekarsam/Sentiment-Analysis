5	I received 2 quotes for BUR and then called Mikku and Sons and their quote for foam was not much higher so I decided it was worth the extra expense after talking to Devin. Josh came out (on time) and taped the plywood seams and sprayed on the foam with a nice level coat of foam and offered to return to apply the second coat of elastomeric after the stucco guys finished, just in case the damage the coating. I was very pleased with the results and would not hesitate to recommend them for a foam roof.
5	These guys were on time, worked all day, cleaned up the yard, and did excellent work on the roof at a good price.  I would use these guys again or tell my friends about them any day.
5	Hands down, this is the most professional, caring, hard working company with which I've ever done business. If all companies operated in such a manner, the world would be a completely different place. The work surpassed the price 10 fold. I will recommend them to anyone.
