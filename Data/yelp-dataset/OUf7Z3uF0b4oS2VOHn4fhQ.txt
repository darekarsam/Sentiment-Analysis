5	Very cool place!Really just came here to check the place out and see what kind of stuff they have. Roommates ended up leaving with a Hookah, Tobacco, and charcoal. The guy running the store was supper helpful and very friendly.  We were monkeying with the singling bowls, and he came over and demonstrated how they work (Very cool by the way!)   Over all pretty cool smoke shop/ knick knack kinda store.
5	What an appropriate name for this shop.What you expect to be here is: Incense on the cheap, funny little knick knacks, hookahs, candles, oils, jewelry, etc. It's employees(a husband and wife duo) also make you feel right at home, and are very knowledgable about their otherworldly products.I can't seem to come here without buying something. And that to me is a successful business.
5	How many stores do you walk into and instantly just start air drumming to the cool tunes you hear?  I've never done that before, until I went into Cosmic Delights and it seemed totally normal.  Lovely, little head shop with all kinds of  "cosmic delights."  I drifted through this store on a puff of incense smoke and surrendered myself to the fact that I was going to drop major dime on large amounts of eclectic items, and so it was my friends.  Dude with a mohawk behind the counter was funny and chill.  I'm pretty sure I want to buy everything in this store.
