5	Magellan was the perfect spot for my strategic marketing meeting! The space is comfortable and made everyone feel "at home". The colors and creative art in the space were 100x better than the boring conference rooms at our offices. Snacks and beverages were provided free of charge. I didn't know this when I booked but they also have a meeting facilitator available for hire. I think I will do this next time so I can feel like I am participating more in the meeting than having to be in the "leader" role. I highly recommend renting this for meetings, events or focus groups. Very reasonable rental rates.
5	Magellan was so easy to work with and totally exceeded every expectation! Their amenities covered everything we could've needed and then some. The exposed brick, toys, and comfortable seating made our strategic planning meeting more comfortable and encouraged creativity and idea creation.
5	We like the place. Ideal location in South End, not too far from uptown. Management is very professional. Courtney was very helpful and accommodating. Place is spacious enough for what we needed and plenty of parking space. Highly recommended
