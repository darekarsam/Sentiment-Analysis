5	they always greet every customer here
1	Horrible Pharmacy! Expect to be waiting at least 30min to wait for an auto re fill prescription. Costumer service is non existent. I am going to avoid this location from now on.
4	Thankfully, all CVS Pharmacy stores are the same.  It makes it easy to shop and find what you're looking for.  This place was no different.  When I developed a cold during this past Winter, I dropped by this place to grab some cough drops.  The cold/flu section was easy to find and checkout was a zip.  Friendly employees here too.Return Factor - 70%
5	Best cvs pharmacy in Scottsdale! Staff is amazing! Avoid the cvs on Indian school and miller and come here if u want fast reliable service! Debbie the pharmacist is so helpful and she will go the extra mile to help any customer!
5	I love this CVS location, they always take care of my needs and the staff is great, there is a new manager in the building who is a really friendly guy, helped resolve back to back issues at to the front while I was waiting to check out.I will continue to come back here, the staff is great, the place is easy to navigate, and I always have a great experience here.
3	Decent store and even more expensive than Walgreens.  I don't see the need and preferred CVS on Cape Cod.
