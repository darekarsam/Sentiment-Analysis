4	There always seem to be sales when i walk in here. Customer service is usually ok though Ive had a couple of visits where its been spotty. Sign up with their list on website & get coupons!
4	Evertime I come in there sees to be a sale!  Clothes are cute and is one of the few places that I found that has skinny/slims that fit my 5 year old with a 4t waist but a 6 in length with out having to sinch the waist in so much that it looks rediculas from the back.
1	Customer service is horrible at this location..The manager doesn't even speak when u walk in and she could be standing right in front..
2	This store is awful. It seems to always be a mess! I never get greeted when I walk in, even if the SM is standing right next to the door! Really? It is awfully crowded in this store and hard to maneuver. I can't understand why they place girls items on the boys side, I always end up missing those racks until I'm checking out and I'm not going to go back to look. When you find deals here they are good however but that's more of a company thing than this store location. I always walk in and walk out without a purchase and mad at myself for wasting my time thinking things will be different.
