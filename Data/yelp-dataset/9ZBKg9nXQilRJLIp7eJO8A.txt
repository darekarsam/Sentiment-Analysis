5	Best pizza I have had since Pendelli's in the 70's. Real pizzeria style pizza! Sooo good!!! Service is amazing! Price is right!
5	This place makes one of the best pizzas in Montreal. I should know because I've tried many. My friend Frank and I lunch at this place frequently. Joe, the owner has memorized our order. It's a large pizza, half all dressed and half with anchovies. Along with that we have a Brio to wash it down and an espresso to finish. I can't vouch for the other items on the menu because I have not tried them but I'm sure they are just as good. Please give this place a try, you won't be disappointed. They also deliver.
4	Best pizza in this area hands down. The cheese is melty, the toppings are bountiful, and the sauce is nice n sweet.The fries are good as well. My fave is the all dressed with bacon. The bacon is actually cooked well, not raw.This place is located in a small strip mall?? Can we even call it that? It's the only good thing in it anyway.Order it and try it out yourself. Yummy.
4	Service here is great.  The owners take pride in their restaurant and are happy and enthusiastic to talk to you, joke, greet etc.  It's nothing fancy, just a good casual Italian restaurant with huge sandwiches and pizza...
4	best pizza in town and amazing Subs (even better if taken on pizza dough)!have eaten in their restaurant and the experience was great!highly recommended if you're in the area.
