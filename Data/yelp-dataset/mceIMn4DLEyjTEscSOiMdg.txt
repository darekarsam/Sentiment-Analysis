1	This is the worst State Farm ever! They will mess up on your account information OVER AND OVER, especially your payment card information!!I have had to call them many times every month to inquire about inflated bills that I keep receiving, because they never put me on automatic payment from the beginning! Every month they have even taken out a HIGHER payment than what my policy says, and even though they said that they have fixed it and the problem will not happen again.. five months later IT STILL DOES. I have stuck it out this long, because I believed that the problem has been fixed month after month.But this is absolutely ridiculous!! The only reason why I chose State Farm was because my parents in California use State Farm; however they charge me higher prices here in Phoenix because I cannot combine accounts in different cities. Please go to another agent!!!!
5	I saved so much money moving my home and auto policies to state farm, I even got a life insurance policy practically for free.  So happy I found this place!
1	Eric is the WORST agent I have ever dealt with!  From not adding a driver to my policy when I spoke with him directly. (I called and questioned his office when I got a summary and was told he was on there. It wasn't until I received a check from State Farm for overpayment that it came out that he failed me as a customer.)  I called about a false claim someone was trying make & of course my agent cant help me.  I contacted the claims department they assured me they wouldn't pay out anything, I called after 90 days & was told nothing was paid and it was closed.  Of course when I started a new policy they did payout on the claim. . . . . . . Now after cancelling with Eric directly I am still receiving a bill from state farm for a policy I canceled before I was due again and now State Farm is calling me as well.  Of course I cant get a hold of anyone at Eric's office to resolve this.  All I can say is DO NOT use this agent!!
