5	This place usually serves restaurants and depanneurs but anyone can go in; no membership required and the selection and quality are better than any crummy Costco. Shop with your room mates or with a bunch of friends and save yourselves a bundle. Even if you just want to purchase small quantities of certain items for yourself it's worth the trek. Best buys are cheeses, pasta, cereal, spices, anything you can think of for a party and frozen stuff including pasta and veggies. For canners and pickles it's a paradise. I can't believe it took me so long to write a review of this place - it is, quite simply, the hidden gem of St-Henri.
5	My little secret, well along with other restaurant owners and people-in-the-know.  This restaurant supply store is open to regulars such as myself.  Costco like in the bulk way to buy food and ingredients but where can you buy Valrhona and Callebaut chocolate at a discounted price?  Also some of my faves are (frozen) confit d'oie/de canard, 1 kg version of fleur de sel, cheeses galore (why would you go to Atwater Market jus t to get ripped-off?), Badoit sparkling water by the case, etc....  Discover for yourself!
4	Correct this place does service restaurants mostly, but as mentioned it is opened to the public.  It is great for the people who cook and I would like to add that I often find unique products like specialy oils (see flax seed, almond,truffle etc), vinegars and spices you can't get anywhere else.  It is also a great a place for the home cook to pick up cooking utensils and baking supplies.  It has a great parking lot which is a must given the volume of things people like us buy, in bulk.
