5	The best GastroPub in Montreal (actually in the South Shore)
3	I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars simply because I wasn't 100% sold on this place and here's why:The starters ordered: French onion soup, beet salad & farmer's plate.The judgement: The French onion soup came in a tiny ass ramekin, pretty much creme brulee size, not only that, it was also oddly flavoured, way too sweet, pass, I also have to add that this miserable little thing cost a whopping nine dollars....NINE (please remove this from your menu, it's almost insulting).The beet salad was small but tasty, the hubby was pleased with his choice, I normally don't like beets but I have to admit I did in this case.The farmer's plate was pretty darn big, something tells me it was supposed to be shared, however nobody informed us about that, the flavours were nice however.The mains ordered: Lamb & lentils, Duck confit, Hangar-steak special.The judgement: My lamb was well prepared, flavour-wise it sort of lacked something for me, salt maybe? It was a weird mix of bitter & sweet. The duck confit was pretty much perfect, crispy skin, good flavours, and the barley risotto that came with it was amazing (cheese goodness).The steak looked good and when asked our friend responded he enjoyed it, so I have to trust his taste buds on that one. So 3 stars for now (technically 3 1/2).I will have to give this place another try, change up my order and see how that goes...
