4	I can't tell you much about the quality of the gas, but I can tell you that the gentleman behind the counter will be happy to help you select their finest bottle of Riesling with a screw cap.I was staying at the Charlotte Airport Sheraton next door and there happened to be zero options other than the marked up hotel rape service and the mediocre in house restaurant/bar.So if you're stuck in the middle of nowhere, this little station has a fairly stocked convenience shop where I was able to score some snacks, gum, and white wine before meeting a friend to hit up the gay bahs.
4	I stopped here for the 7Eleven, NOT the gas.  While I did get gas, I was more interested in my slurpee. Minus one star because, the women behind the counter were more concerned with their own conversation then trying to acknowledge me salivating over my drink.  I found the crazy straw that goes with the slurpee and I was in heaven!!  Not the toy straw, but the candy straw.  They are a rare find and they always bring a smile to my face.
2	Boo. They had no bug spray here! In fact, this wasn't a very well-stocked gas station. I imagine they mostly get people bringing back their rental cars and other people near the airport who are interested in going inside for convenience store amenities... :(
