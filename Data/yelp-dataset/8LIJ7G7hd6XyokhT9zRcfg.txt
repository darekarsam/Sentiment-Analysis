5	We used Leach Painting for our house interior last year.  They were very professional, and completed the work on time and cleanly.  Their quote was also very reasonable.  I can recommend them wholeheartedly.
5	Recently had the exterior of my 15-yr old home (never previously repainted) done by Leach.  This is a family-run business that's been around a long time, and feels like it in dealing with them (and I mean that in the most complimentary way).  The whole experience was outstanding.  Prep was very thorough, and end result looks great.  Price was very reasonable, and the work completed within the specified timeframe.  I had to wait a few weeks due to business being brisk, but the wait was well worth it.  I also had Mike do an estimate for my interior, and will have them paint it as well eventually.
5	I had Leach Painting paint 2 walls inside the house, the entire exterior of the house as well as replace the slats in my back gate with synthetic slats.  They did an outsanding job.  The employees were friendly, efficient and very knowledgable about their trade.  The price was great too.  I would highly recommend them.
