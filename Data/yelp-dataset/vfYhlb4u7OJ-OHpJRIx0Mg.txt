5	A great breakfast and lunch spot. Excellent food -- the breakfast burrito is stellar, as is the french toast. At lunch the bacon cheddar burger is excellent, and if you enjoy wraps you need to try the Turkey Cranberry Wrap - it'll remind you of Thanksgiving at any time of the year. It hasn't been super busy any of the times I've visited -- yet. That will be sure to change as word spreads about this hidden gem. Nice job by the staff too!
5	Excellent place to have a good quality breakfast or lunch at a reasonable price. Have tried many things and nothing has disappointed me yet. Onion rings are especially good.
5	We got breakfast delivered a few times and it was great. Large stuffed breakfast burritos for a great price so delicious ! Great strawberry salad, and variety.  The best breakfast burrito I have ever had ! I will keep ordering the large breakfast burritos. He really hooks you up !
