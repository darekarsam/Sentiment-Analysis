2	I always want to like Panda Express. They're friendly, nice establishment, conveniently located- but the food always leaves me disappointed
3	This is your typical Panda Express; the food is predictably good - the same predictable food you will get at any other Panda Express. Nothing to write home to mom about; but so much healthier than the typical fast-food joint.
2	Typical panda. All the food looks so amazing and then you get it home and its just Eh. Could do worse with a quick meal, but I always leave feeling so dissatisfied with the food. Service was quick and friendly, so no complaints at all with staff. But unfortunately service is only part of the picture, and pushing $10 for lunch I have higher expectations.
1	Their customer service sucks there. Every time we decide to go their I hope different people are working there.  Today the orange chicken was bla. Not impressed.
