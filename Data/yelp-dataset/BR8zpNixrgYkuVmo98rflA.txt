5	Dr. Rick Owen owns this. He has been a D.C. for many years in Las Vegas. He is caring and knowledgeable. He takes time to help you understand what your problems may be. I'm a LMT and I highly recommend him for his professionalism and high quality of care.
5	Been to chiropractors off and on for years.  Dr. Owen is head and shoulders above any I've ever encountered.Dr. Owen gets right to the issue, explains everything in words you can understand, and does not "string it out" - and he doesn't try to load you up with all kinds of accessory items.His concern is strictly for your well-being, and it shows.Thanks ever so much!
5	I have been going to Dr Owen for over 20 years now & he is the best chiropractor in Vegas. he really connects & knows his patients. He takes great care of them as well. I would refer Dr Owen to EVERYBODY
5	Dr. Owen is by-far the best chiropractor in town! He has helped me tremendously with new and old injuries from car accidents. Quality is the name of his business and quality is what you get. He is a highly proficient chiropractor, knows a tremendous amount about health, and truly wants to see his patients get well and succeed. Other chiropractors I have been too do not take the time and make the effort that Dr. Owen does. I highly recommend him.
