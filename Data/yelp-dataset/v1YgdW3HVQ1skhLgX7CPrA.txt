3	My only experience here was shooting the GSSF (GLOCK Sport Shooting Foundation) Match right after SHOT Show in January of 2013.  The turnoff on the left side of the road is easy to miss, so when you get within a mile or so, you want to step up your awareness just so you don't miss it and have to turnaround like I did.  Once you get there it's your typical range with dirt roads and buildings made from converted cargo containers.The match was held on what I believe was the backside of range, some people had to walk, but there was a limited amount of parking available close by if you didn't want to walk from the main lot.  The range and match cadre were very friendly.  This was a 200% improvement from the Las Vegas Metro range where this event was held in 2011.  As always, a special thank you for all of the ROs that volunteered their time and the GSSF Employees that spend their lives traveling all over the country to host these matches for GLOCK owners.This was actually the best match I have shot thus far placing second and third in two of the five divisions I competed in.
5	Desert Sportsman's is a private gun club. You must be a good standing member of the NRA and pay yearly dues of $200.00. If you live on the West side of town, this is a great place to go. They are open every day except for one Saturday a month is a cleanup day.There are many ranges here for all types of guns. You need to bring your own targets and be sure to clean up after yourself.This range holds many competitions and training for Metro and other departments. They also hold competitions for clubs.It is a great place to shoot. Everyone here is really safe due to the fact that this is a private club.
