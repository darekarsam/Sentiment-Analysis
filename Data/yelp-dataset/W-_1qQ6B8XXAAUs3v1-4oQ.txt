4	Very pleasant location, near the Schlosspark and a block away from the tram.Large grocery store 100 meters away a big plus - open from 7AM-10PM.Rooms are clean, modern and decently-sized (especially for european standards) and the free internet is wonderful.  Hearty German-style breakfast.  Highly recommend.
3	If you check in, take care, that you will end up in the new building across the street. The rooms are new and functional!The hotel is located kind of central and easy to reach by public transport.The hotel parking garage is very difficult to drive in, so be aware, if you drive a huge car.
