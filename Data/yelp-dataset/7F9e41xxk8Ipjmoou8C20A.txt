4	Good food at a reasonable price.  It is a small quaint restaurant.  I like it better than their fancy Belmont location.  The food there has a different taste.  They have a friendly staff and the food is worth the value.
4	For japanese fast food, I love it. I can run in, order, head out pretty quick. The staff is friendly. If you want to eat the place has always been really clean. I just wished they deliveried!  :))
1	Went there last night, great concept, good looking food ... Tasteless and bland.
4	you'd walk right by if if you're not careful. Sake Express 2 Japanese Steakhouse & Seafood please! In fact everything on a skewer! Beer all around. A great place for late night snacking with friends, and it's kinda near times square so you know all the trains stop there. Yes Bourdain stopped here, and yes you should get everything on a stick. You won't regret it.
