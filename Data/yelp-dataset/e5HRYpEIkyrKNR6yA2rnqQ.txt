4	This is a cute place to catch brunch in the South Hills. I loved their cinnamon rolls, home fries, bacon, and french toast. The service was efficient and friendly (the customers were as well). Yet another strip mall secret gem!
3	Even though I pass this plaza almost daily, I never even thought of eating at TBA until a recent Saturday morning when I was craving something tasty. We arrived around 11. About half of this tiny (maybe 10 tables total?) restaurant was full of happy, smiling patrons. The inside was covered with what I would describe as years worth of memorabilia of the locals celebrating the community. We ordered at the counter and awaited our food. Within a few minutes, my huge chocolate chip pancakes arrived. Soon after came a large cinnamon roll covered in a rich icing that was melting down the sides. The pancakes were the lightest, most fluffy melt in your mouth deliciousness I have had in a long time. The cinnamon roll was equally as delicious. Overall, everyone was pleased with their food choices. Now the reason for 3 stars. The drink selection was sparse. Cans of soda, plastic containers of what some call "juice," coffee you pour yourself. I feel that these options are in need of improvement. The tables, chairs, floors and walls were also in need of a deep clean. The other customers didn't seem to mind but as a self proclaimed germaphobe, it would prevent me from coming back.
