1	First they told us that the bank is going to pay for all the fees ( no points no hidden fees) We dealt with this company for refinancing. Yellow Pages also has 4 negative reviews. This company may be just a "front " for an appraisal company. The Manager/ Owner told us we are "approved" and when asked about the Lending Disclosure in writing, they slapped us with 'actually you are not approved the bank said your appraisal is not good. The appraiser they sent came on Saturday wearing shorts and very casual. The company will tell you this appraiser was sent by the bank yet the bank rejected their own appraiser? Then they offer to pay for the next appraisal if we agree to go to another lender, this time, they sent us a Lending disclosure that they are going to charge $$$fees now. BEWARE. Dont deal with them for any of your lending needs. You will loss money over the appraiser which I suspect , is their side business.
1	If I could give them negative stars, I would. Terrible company to do business with. Would not recommend to anyone unless you want absolutely no communication (none, zero, zilch, nada), slow action, and a higher than promised rate (.75 higher including .24% they added for no apparent reason). I assume the .24 is how they cover the "zero charge"processing. With all of the good mortgage companies out there, there is no room in the market for such a poor company. Whatever you do, learn from my error and don't use Blue Brick Financial. Read other reviews. I wish I would have paid attention to them. Will never, ever, ever use them. I have made sure to tell everyone I know and posted on the electronic bulletin board at work for my fellow 3000 employees in Phoenix not use them.
