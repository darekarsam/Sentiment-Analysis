3	Aldi is like the Sam's Club of grocery stores. There are no frills, you have to pay a quarter for your cart, and there are no baggers because there are generally no bags. This location, in front of the Black Lion has bags for purchase, something I had not yet seen in an Aldi. The cashier and the selection were in line with other Aldi's I have been to. This location in particular I think needs to do a better job with scheduling employees because the lines were ridiculous. They also only take cash or debit cards, so be aware when you get to the checkout line.
5	I love Aldi!  Where else can you purchase avocados for $0.59 each??Aldi's business model is phenomenal.  Why pay extra on food items just to cover extraneous overhead costs (plastic bags, fancy product displays, laborers bagging stuff for you)?  I really don't like the wastefulness of plastic shopping bags (I'm looking at you, Harris Teeter!), so I love that I can come to Aldi, shop, grab a few boxes off the shelf, and pack up my groceries by myself.Aldi has also been increasing their organic product offerings, which I love.  They now have nitrite-free bacon and organic salad greens, in addition to the many wonderful food items they've always sold.  Have you tried their bacon-wrapped filets?  They're $4 for two whole cuts of beef!  This store is truly amazing.I recommend Aldi to any person looking to save money on great food!
5	Affordable prices and quality groceries.  So yeah this is a winner in my book! Took me awhile to bond with the bag it yourself routine- and yes they don't care a lot of fluff but they do carry affordable food and it's quality products !
