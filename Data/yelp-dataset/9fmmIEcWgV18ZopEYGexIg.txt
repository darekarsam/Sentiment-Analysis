5	They got the good stuff for a very good price.  Always willing to help in any way possible.  If you are looking to get Base Boards, Casing or Trim... start here.  I got my solid pine door casing here as well as my front door hardware (Emtek) looks great!
1	My wife went to pick up something ordered..when she told one of the employees there her name and account info, he went off on her in the most disgusting way, blamed her for getting them stuck with wrong hardware, talking down to her and not listening that she was just told to pick something up, this worker was nasty, rude, deplorable an obstinate fool, so disrespectful. Another employee looked up the account and said " oh actually it looks like everything is in order" She requested an apology for this stressful attack, his snide response was " listen lady I gotta do what I gotta do and could care less about you" If that's the service you want go to avanti in Las Vegas...to be verbally assaulted..Bring a body guard. Real a$$ holes. Should not even be in business if this guy represents them.
