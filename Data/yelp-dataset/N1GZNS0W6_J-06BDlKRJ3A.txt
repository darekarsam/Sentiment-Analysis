4	Fresh tasty big puffy gorgeous Italian baked goods can be found here, in addition to the fresh pizza Gibran mentions in his wildly succinct review ;) This is a takeout spot, not sit down, but you can mosey down the street to one of the sweetest little parcs in town with your eats. You can also get nice gelato here, and cakes, and the small crowds of Italians always leaving here with big white boxes full of pastries attest to the deliciousness to be found within.
1	This review for Roma boulangerie is strictly for the "ice scream" the worst ever. It is possibly old, not enough served to make fresh? But it is not worth the $4.00 a styro cup, (no cones) that you will inevitably through away after one small plastic spoon half full....awful, I cannot describe, but nothing like an Italian gelato!!On the up side, they make wonderful croissants, chocolatine's , pizza's maybe slightly overdressed, but good none the less.
4	My family and I found this place after I would trade my salami sandwiches at lunch for my friend's pizza while I was in elementary school. Somehow my mom found out about it and asked my friend's mom where she got it - and then the whole family was turned on to their items.From plain tomato sauce pizza to cannoli, there are some very tasty goods that will satisfy many tastes. We usually order an eggplant and olive pizza, which has marinated eggplant and deliciously salty kalamata olives. They also have some dense, sweet and slightly tart, lemon cookies - but if you only have room for one item, get a square of pizza. I could eat it every day and not get tired of it, that's how good it is.
