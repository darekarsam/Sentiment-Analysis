5	Love, Love, Love!We visit to see Badger Women's Hockey.  A great facility that is easy to navigate, clean and the people are just super nice.Highly recommend!
5	What is there to dislike about the LaBahn? Small, intimate, no bad sightlines, you're close to the ice and action and it's $5 to get in to a women's hockey game where you're watching literal Olympic-level talent. It's Madison, so there's no parking. Concessions aren't spectacular, but games are usually at 2 pm, so you can avoid eating there. But those are the only two bad things I can say. It's so nice for the women to have a facility where the crowd doesn't get lost and for both teams to be able to practice on campus.
5	Best hockey arena I've ever been to, I really wish the USHL team was playing there in addition to the UW womens.
