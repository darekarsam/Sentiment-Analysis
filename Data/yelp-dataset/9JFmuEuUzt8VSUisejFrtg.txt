5	I love these people. I see Stacy the physicians assistant most of the time. She is wonderful and is a great listener. I do not have insurance and they give generous discounts for self pay patience. The staff is wonderful . And the man who takes my money at the end makes me feel good about it, always so sweet.
4	My husband and I visited them recently because he was experiencing chest pains.  It felt great to speak with someone who listened patiently and not make us feel like they're ready to bolt out the door the second they walk in the room.  We felt like we were important.  And all are questions were answered to a satisfaction.  Now, that's real doctors work.
