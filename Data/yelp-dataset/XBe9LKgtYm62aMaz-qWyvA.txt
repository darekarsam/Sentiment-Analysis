5	LOVE this location! Its so open and absolutely beautiful. I'm a VIB Rouge member and I was treated like gold here. They have all the same brands as the other locations PLUS a new one called Becca which I have fallen in love with. The staff are also so sweet. The navigation is very easy in this shop as well. Everything is clearly labeled and simple. Great addition to Summerlin!
4	This was my first visit to this Sephora and it was a weekday afternoon so they weren't super busy.  I had a very helpful employee who showed me how to do a "smokey eye".  Not for me but at least now I know it!  I refilled all my normal stuff plus some so really dropped bank.I love the selection Sephora.  They have a foundation not found elsewhere that actually matches my glow in the dark skin.. which is surprisingly olive since I'm actually a mutt.  They are also very helpful in selecting new products and helping you try them on.Overall, it's just great to try before you buy and have someone help you do that in a very hygenic way.
5	I love exploring products without being bothered too much, so I've learned to appreciate the despondency of the typical Sephora employee. That said, I was taken aback by the absolute warmth, knowledge, and attentiveness of their employees. Carol was awsome, helped me with everything, and her product recs were spot on - nothing I want to return!
