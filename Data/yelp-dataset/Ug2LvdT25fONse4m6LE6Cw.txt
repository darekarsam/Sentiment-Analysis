4	I love coming here, it's the perfect size, not too busy and well laid outPrices are decent, great selection of mostly Mediterranean food, only their bread and prepared foods selection is a little weak.Their cold cuts, steaks, cheeses are all varied and not too pricey..Their fruits and veggies are well priced, which is a big plus for me.PS. Easy parking on the street, it's amazing how we take that for granted living in the city.
