3	These people are always so friendly. Whenever someone walks in the door, the cook/owner(?) comes out from the back and greets you with a big smile. The girls in the front are also very nice, but are pretty quiet.The food itself is decent, but nothing special. It looks like they're going for Greek-ish food. Gyros, falafel, etc, but they also have fish and chips and other Canadian-ish foods.I do like the falafel pita here a bit more than at Grab A Greek because they have more choices for veggies and sauce rather than just tomato, cucumber and onion at Grab A Greek. It's also quite a bit cheaper: $4.50 rather than $6.50.

3	Good place to grab a gyro for the value. Especially for those days when you're studying on campus and have no time to pack foos yourself. They have a deal of 2 gyros for $7 which was good. The gyros had a generous portion of meat and the honey mustard really had a great flavour. All the toppings were fresh as expected! And the new manager is so friendly compared to the old manager. He really makes going there 10x more pleasant than it use to be!
