5	This is the first high end store I've ever been to where the sales girls are actually really friendly.  I guess it's because it's Vegas and you never know who's rich and who's not there.  Anyway, I'm a big fan of Guiseppe Zanotti's shoes and I had unfortunately/fortunately forgot my clubbing heels at home on this Vegas trip, so obviously, I needed to buy a new pair.After searching through every shop in the Forum Shops and about to lose hope, I found this lovely little store and my hopes were up once again.  As mentioned above, the sales girls were totally not snotty and helped me choose the perfect pair of sexy sky high heels.  I walked out of that store feeling great about my purchase and ready for my night out on the town.
5	Fabulous store layout and design. Beautiful merchandise.  Enjoy stopping by after lunch in the Forum Shoppes to drool! Great sales every now and then for all you locals who can stop by whenever.  Make friends with an employee and you'll be good to go!
5	Service is key with Giuseppe Zanotti. Went to Caesars looking for a birthday pair of shoes. Was thinking about Christian Louboutin, but once I fell in love with Giuseppe's chain sneakers... My mind was set. Sun Simmons was a great sales associated she was so nice and friendly. She made my shopping experience such a nice one. I really love Giuseppe's styles and materials... And the craftsmanship of the shoes are beautiful. I'm in love!
