3	Formerly Gilda's, Prevue is a small night club with a significantly understocked bar.  It's basically two rooms, one a bar/lounge and the other a dance floor.  Each has a large mirror that helps to make them look bigger.  The enjoyment of your evening will completely depend on the DJ.  A big plus is that what the bar area lacks in seating is made up for with several couches in the main room.  So if you don't feel like getting your groove on in the "dancing mirror room" you can chill out in the "drinking mirror room".There is a huge lot for parking and the bus will get you there as well.  However, there is nowhere to go once you're there if you want a "similar but different" experience since it's located in Noda.  If you're out for a night of dancing make sure to have a backup plan which will most likely be downtown.
5	Great spot to see improv comedy every Fri & Sat.

Turned out we were there on Improv night and it turned out to be quite entertaining and funny - there was a cover (probably to make up for the little amount of alcohol I saw being drank) We spent about an hour there before heading on out to other joints in the NoDa area.  Might be a cool date night place if you both are into improv and comedy.
