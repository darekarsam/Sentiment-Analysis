4	Such good beer from people who know beer.  Had an awesome BBQ pulled pork grilled cheese.
4	Good beer selection and it's fairly priced. A little rough around the edges design-wise, but it's a great spot to tip a few back. Food is decent - they have a grilled cheese of the day that a lot of people enjoy. Unique to the area, hope it sticks around for a long time.
4	This review is for all the non-beer lovers like me. I've never had a beer I've liked, so I ordered their house red wine. It was a hefty portion size for only $7 - and it was actually pretty good! But what surprised me even more was that there was actually a beer on the menu I liked! It was very fruity and less than 4% alcohol, so it was really more like juice, but hey, I liked it.Some people also ordered some food. The fries were really good and the burgers got good reviews as well. I wasn't a big fan of the hummus and pita appetizer though - the hummus was very spicy and not like what you would expect.
5	To put it simply this place is a beer lovers heaven. Tons of craft beer but not just from Ontario, they have selections from all over. I fall in love every time I walk through the door. Their menu is also very beer inspired and melt in your mouth delicious. The staff are very knowledgeable as well. You can tell they are beer lovers!Chances are you'll come for the beer and stay for the food... and more beer. My only complaint is that they don't open until 4 and they can be really busy. I hope they expand one day.Keep being you. Bent Elbow
