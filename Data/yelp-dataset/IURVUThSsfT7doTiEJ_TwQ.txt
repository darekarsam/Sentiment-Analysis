4	This is a fairly inconspicuous stop along the Little Sugar Creek Greenway, but you really ought to stop and give it a look! Or rather, a feel. The feature attraction of this little plaza is an art installation set in braille, sculpture and music. At one corner of the plaza sits a poem written in Braille. Then to the side are several small silver balls on posts, which (sometime in the future as of April 2013) will play music set to the Braille bumps. Confused? Intrigued? Think about the little bumps inside a music box, and that ought to help. What a neat idea, hopefully it will be done soon, 4 stars just for the potential of being really cool.
4	What a beautiful space! Thankfully, lululemon is utilizing the grassy area for spring/summer outdoor yoga.  The City of Charlotte (?) keeps this area so nice & well-kept.  Plenty of people use this area to walk, run, & the kids use it to play. As Casandra mentioned, there is some nice art to look at.  Additionally, the stone archways make for a nice backdrop for photography/picture taking.The only downside is you have to park at The Met, since there isn't any street parking.
5	One of my new favorite green spaces/frisbee destinations. There are few things better than a well-kept section of manicured grass and this little portion is found next to The Met and right off of the Little Sugar Creek Greenway. Love that there are plenty of tables, chairs, bike racks, shaded areas, and tons of reflective steel orbs. The installment(s) here are interesting and there is plenty of literature to check out. Great spot to walk to with your lunch or just hang out for a bit.
4	We always stop here during our walks on the greenway. There's a nice area to let the dogs run around and do some of their favorite activity - sniffing. Great place for photos too with a skyline background. The big reflective ball is cool too.
