3	Perhaps I've been spoiled by Walmart competitors who offer wifi. I find myself frustrated with the lack of wifi when shopping. I like to use my phone to pull up recipes,  the walmart savings catcher, etc and was unable to use their network.  I will say that mcdonalds and the photo area have public wifi,  but they don't do a lot of good for shoppers.
2	Not a huge fan - but I am not a huge fan of Walmart in general so theres that. Overcrowded, crazy, meh customer service, store was not super clean. I wont be back unless I have to.
1	This is one of those stores where you hate going but you have to. Walmart is a disgusting store expecially this one , this store is dirty, has a prostitute motel in front and also attracts the crazies. I cannot stand Walmart and will avoid it whenever I can. If you need help with ANYTHING in the store I garuntee you can look up on your phone on how to build it or find it faster then the employees can think of whats going on. And the "management team" is always never to be found . YAY for the biggest company in the world.
