1	unprofessional and expensive; manager had to track down and recall the worker Rick to have the ac work correctly; you have to stay on top of these people if you hire them to fix your ac... make sure the job is complete before they leave...
1	Unprofessional work, worker left without fixing AC and took home parts.  Had to call a different company to fix unit after three days.
1	Rip-off. Quoted me $5900 to replace a failed A/C system. I responded that's too much. The guy went on to explain that they were going to replace condenser, coil and furnace. The furnace was not failing. Without furnace their quote was $4480. Then I called the highest rated AC repair company here on Yelp and their quote was $3500.
5	Great, speedy, friendly service. Got my furnace working with a quickess, just in time for the first freeze. The repair guy was personable & took time to explain each step to me.
