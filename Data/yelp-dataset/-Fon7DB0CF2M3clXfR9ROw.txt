3	A nice, good-sized pool with one lane for lap swimming, and a diving area. There are 4 or 5 big umbrellas around the cement decking, not a lot of shade. No grass, no eating. There are a bunch of lounge chairs available on a first-come basis. Lots of kids & families, a separate kiddie pool, ok locker room. Nice. 5.75$ for non-residents.
5	Amazing pool - great for kids and playground and wading pool is great too! It would obviously be best to be an Outremont resident to get a good deal here, but still, it's $5.75 for adults and children for a day-pass. You can bring anything you want on to the deck (snacks, towels, strollers) and there are decent change rooms and showers. The adjoining playground and wading pool make it easy to spend an entire day here, which we often do. Make it a point to visit nearby Van Horne bakery Mamie Clafoutis - definitely not to be missed!
4	Nice big pool, very clean and there is always a deck chair and some shade to be had under umbrellas and big, leafy trees. The change rooms are kind of dark though and the showers are right there out in the open which is a tad odd. Adult swims at noon are perfect for laps and there is plenty of room for lots of people at what I think is a fairly steep price though: $5.75. I like the pool itself a lot, but would pick the free Laurier pool over this pool more often than not. My biggest complaint besides the price though? The life guards were annoying and confusing absolutely everyone by blowing their whistles every couple of minutes. People would stop, look around, wonder what we were doing wrong only to realise that it was the teenage girl lifeguards whistling at friends to bring them something or to get their attention...don't do that!
