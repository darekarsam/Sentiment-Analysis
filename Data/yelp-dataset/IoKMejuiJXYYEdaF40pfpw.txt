5	I have been to many chiropractors over my lifetime and Price Chiropractic is my favorite so far! Super friendly and professional and the adjustments rock! They have reasonable cash prices for patients without insurance and take almost every kind of ins if you do have it.
4	Dr. Price was extremely professional and helped me with my neck pain immediately. He wasn't pushy like most chiropractors who try to get you to pay for a treatment plan upfront. I highly recommend Dr. Price because of his professionalism, pricing, and ability to alleviate pain in one session.
4	Dr. Price was very helpful and answered any/all question I had regarding my situation and pain.The staff was friendly, and I was able to call and make an appointment within just a couple hours.Very helpful being it happened to be a last minute ordeal.4/5!
