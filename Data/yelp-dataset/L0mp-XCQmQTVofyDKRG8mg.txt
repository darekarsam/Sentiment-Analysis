2	Burnt down and reopened recently.  The rebuild is nice and modern...too bad they couldn't rebuild their customer service too. But I guess it is your typical fast food place filled with unhappy employees and wrong orders with decent food.
5	Much nicer since the old one burned down and was replaced.  Typical Wendy's, fast &  hot.
4	You never hope for it, but this location burning down really helped it. Nice modern building now.
