4	Had a group dinner here and wasn't sure what to expect.  The restaurant I would classify as modern ordinary fusion.  Why I say this is because you have your ordinary classic family restaurant dishes:  pizza, steak, pasta or fish with a multitude of other items.  The restaurant has a funky flair that is what you expect when "out on the town" for a night.  On this evening I had the hanger steak (bavette de boeuf) with fries.It  also came with a great little assortment of veg!  What made it however was the "meau mustard" sauce.  The sauce had a great rich flavour that complemented the steak wonderfully!  I ordered my steak rare and it was a bit tougher than other bavette's I've had. Atmosphere was nice and we had a good evening!  I'd come back to try other items and noticed they even have a cool little kids menu!
5	I love this place. Been there about 20 times and I always get the Dijon chicken or the Californian salad so I can not speak about any other menu items. A little pricey but well worth it.
