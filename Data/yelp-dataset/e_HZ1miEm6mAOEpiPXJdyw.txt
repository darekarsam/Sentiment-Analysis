5	Dr. Iain is fantastic.  I've been to many chiropractors over the years and some of not so good, others are OK, very few are very good and Dr. Iain is VERY good.  He has a great personality, listens, gives good advice, knows the science and anatomy very well, has good 'feel' to his patients.  He also won't force a neck that doesn't feel like going... cannot tell you how important it is to see only chiropractors who listen to both patient and the body.   His wife Evelyn handles the office duties, they are both wonderful people.   I saw Dr. Iain regularly over 5+ years and there were times I was hurting and he fixed me every time.   I was having knee pains and he described in detail the structure of the knee and which muscle was likely weakened by my desk job resulting in my kneecap being off center and why that was causing the pain.  He suggested some specific exercises I could do.  A few weeks later the knee pain was gone.  I could run down stairs again pain free.   I miss them since I've moved to San Francisco!
5	Simply put:  Dr. Iain fixes me. I get back and neck adjustments. A couple times I was in deep trouble, back-wise, and I was so thankful to walk out of his office feeling so much better.  He has been very patient and flexible for me to get in to see him. I think I've been going to him for almost 10 yrs.  He is very capable and he and his wife, Evelyn are very nice people.  I recommend highly.
5	Dr. Iain is the amazing. He gives me the best adjustments every time. He takes his time, and makes sure that I am ready for the adjustment, and is very thorough. He is never pushy, but is honest about the treatments that will help. He is also very fair in his pricing, and his hours accommodate my schedule well. I can have an appointment, or walk in. His office is comfortable and efficient. I cannot recommend him enough.
