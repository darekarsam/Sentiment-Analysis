5	Fresh sandwiches, salads and homemade soups make this deli a winner. They are very friendly and the food is good. I love the variety and they have daily specials. I've been eating here a while and I've never been disappointed.
5	First time stopping in and was greatly pleased by the sandwich choices as well as the prices. I had the North Shore sandwich and really enjoyed the combination of flavors and left satisfied with my choice.
4	I was in the mood to try someplace different on my lunch hour, even if it meant trekking a few blocks out of my way.  And after having tried Boulevard Deli, I can safely say it was well worth the hike.  Nearly all of the items on the menu here have Pittsburgh-centric names and it was hard for me to decide.  The Pittsburgher?  Hmm, I'm not exactly fond of chipped ham, so no.The South Side?  Well a good cappicola is always tempting.  The Squirrel Hill?  Hey, that's my neighborhood, so why not!  The Squirrel Hill is corned beef, 1000 Island dressing, and 'kraut.In other words, a Ruben!Oh, but my sandwich was excellent and I was so glad I was able to walk a little bit of it off on the way back!
