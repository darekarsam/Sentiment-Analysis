5	I found Shea Wellness Group through a business networking connection. I'm glad I came to check out the office and sign up for acupuncture treatment. The front office staff is friendly and courteous. I got my treatment from Dr. Valentina Khoury Dubasik. She's friendly, caring and very knowledgeable about naturopathic and conventional western medicine practices. I came here to find an alternative to the western medicine approach of swallowing a pill for my chronic conditions. I found my answers a Shea Wellness Group. I am impressed by how many different services they offer and the wealth of information available about non-traditional treatments such as herbal remedies, acupuncture, and some treatments I've never heard of. The prices are reasonable which was a relief to me because I have a high deductible plan and pay for most services out of pocket. I found Shea Wellness Group, especially Dr. Khoury, to be passionate about naturopathic medicine. I'm glad I know I have other treatment options, delivered with care at Shea Wellness Group.
5	I have been going to Shea Wellness for massages from Ed for about a year now.  I continue to go because other places lack in skill and their ability to provide a comfortable environment. Ed is very professional and concerned about helping you to get rid of all those uncomfortable lumps in your body that store your stress. I prefer a deep tissue massage and Ed's hands are perfect for that. I would and have recommended him to friends the same way he was recommended to me.
