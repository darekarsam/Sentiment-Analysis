5	I have used quite a few different printers in the past and have had mixed results.  Sometimes the product wasn't consistent, sometimes the service wasn't dependable... So when I finally was introduced to Despins Printing & Graphics I had great hopes but also some reservations as to what I should expect.  After being a customer and receiving excellent products and service I would gladly recommend Despins to anyone looking to have a solid experience with a highly dependable staff and product line.  It's so nice to find a business which really values their customers and makes sure to offer the highest quality work.If you're looking for a printer who is dependable and consistent look no further, I highly recommend that you try Despins Printing and Graphics out!
5	My daughter has a discount at a national printing company but her discounted prices could not compete with my wonderful business printing at Despins. Jackie, the owner is always smiling and working;  all the employees are helpful, friendly, artistic and most importantly, competent. My brochures are faces and the laser printer does the most realistic skin color i have ever attained from a printer.They make me feel special!Marilyn B
