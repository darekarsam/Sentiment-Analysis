2	Very very bad online service. I ordered a printer a few months ago showed to be "on sale" on the french version of the site. The day after I placed my order I revisited the site (the english version) and the product I ordered was listed as "Refurbished". So check well before you order anything from them as french an english sites don't have the same info always. I ordered a Tablet 3 days ago to be shipped to a physical location of the enterprise and I was told to receive it today (picking it up at the site) between 9h and 17h. At 15h I receive an e-mail saying that it will take 7 to 14 days more as the stocks they had runned off. So WTF they had to tell me that before as I already bought accesories for that tablet. Now I have to wait 14 more days, almost until the day Transformer Prime will be avaible to buy.Don't deal with they online, do it if you pass by one of their stores. Online service is   c r a p from them!!!!
