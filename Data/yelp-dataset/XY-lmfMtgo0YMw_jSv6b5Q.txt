4	Wow, I notice all these new QuikTrip popping up in the Charlotte area, stop to get something to drink.   They had about 20 or more selections of fountain drinks, any type of coffees u can think of.  And fast food items u can order on a touch screen plus they had some hot foods like hotdogs, sausage and etc that actually look freshly display.New and clean !  Amazing!,  Nice addition to the Charlotte area.
