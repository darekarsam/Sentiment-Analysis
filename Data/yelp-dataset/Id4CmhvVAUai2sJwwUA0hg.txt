5	A small, family-owned business, Florateria has been selling beautiful flower arrangements and house plants for nearly 60 years - they opened their doors in 1956!Florateria is open 365 days a year, offering a wide and interesting variety of flowers and plants - both cut and potted - for any number of occasions. The flowers are always fresh, with a selection of the regular favourites (e.g., roses, gerberas) alongside some more rare and tropical stunners (e.g., ginger plant flowers, birds of paradise). The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful, and the service is lightning fast. The prices are extremely reasonable - on a recent visit on Easter Sunday, I picked up a large potted hydrangea for $30 (decorative pot included!) and a bouquet of a dozen stunning tulips for $14.95. Despite the fact that it was a busy holiday morning and the line-up of customers practically went out the door, I received great service. I stop in about once a month to pick up gifts or a small bouquet just for fun.
