2	City Tavern is an attractive restaurant in the heart of uptown Charlotte. They boast a nice menu with a great seafood selection, so we gave it a shot. For starters, we went here on a Saturday night at 8pm and were practically the only ones inside, which is never a good sign. I ordered a mojito, which was really good and refreshing - one of my favorite parts of our experience there. I ordered the seabass and it really wasn't anything spectacular. This is definitely one of those restaurants that gets the job done, it is clean and the food is OK, but I would probably wouldn't think to go here when looking for a good restaurant on a Saturday night. If you do head over, look for my second favorite part of our experience, our waiter. He was so cool and absolutely hysterical!! I can't remember his name, but look for the guy who looks like Dave Chappelle. You'll get dinner and a show.
