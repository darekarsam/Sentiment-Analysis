He has Great Talent and knowledge and as far as I could tell there is a good team working positive environment, great sense of humor...everybody was  very Professional Great staff, clean , very well decorated. Environment of peace and good karma. I am happy with my new tattoo, oh and the prices are very reasonable.
5	Kong is Amazing tattoo Artist. My tattoo came out better than expected , the tattoo lines and colors were very clear.. The establishment is Very Clean and everyone was very professional. I highly recommended to everyone.
5	Great place. Just got my first tattoo there. While it wasn't anything complicated, just lettering, Anthony did a great job making it extremely clean and impeccably lined up. Anthony was also a great guy and made my first time much less intimidating. The place is classic as hell, I wouldn't want anything less from a tattoo parlor. Price was 20 bucks less than expected and was worth it. I recommend Anthony, of course, but I know any artist at Stedfast is dedicated to his work.
