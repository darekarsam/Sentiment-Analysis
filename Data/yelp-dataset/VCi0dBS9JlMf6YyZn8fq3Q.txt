5	The cutest 50's diner around! Friendly and fast service, but I wouldn't even mind if it was slow, because I could sit there for hours and be happy!  Food is so yummy, and will take back to sitting in your moms kitchen! Ooh La La the local fire dept just walked in for dinner! Yes please!!
5	The service was great. Nothing special but that's how I like it. I don't like places to make a huge fuss when you first walk in. We ordered burgers and it was so yummy even the fries were great.  Staff was friendly and the environment was fun and inviting.
1	I have been here a few times and will not be going back. I love the decor and music, but the staff has no clue what service means. Food quality is NOT consistent! Sometimes good, others horrible, never great... Every time I am there, there are new/ different employees. I love mom and pop shops but this place is a nightmare! Where is the manager?!
