4	After working up an appetite walking around the Jean-Talon market, I walked by this place and thought the sandwiches being eaten by everyone outside looked pretty good so I decided to give it a go.  I had the lamb sandwich and wow, I had a moment.  The baguette was perfect... soft on the inside, toasted on the outside.  The tomatoes, fresh and juicy.  The lamb, melt in your mouth flavor.  I should have asked for more hot sauce though.  Before this, my favorite baguette/bun sandwich was Nicky's in the East Village, NYC.  All hail the new king.
4	9 months later, I came back again, and had the lamb sandwich.  It was still the awesome incredibleness that I remembered the first time around.  And of course, I didn't re-read my previous review and forgot to ask for more hot sauce.
4	i don't know how to describe this place as its more of a restaurant than a butchery. at least, i didn't see any butchering being done. maybe on weekends?its a halal sandwich shop that offers kafka, merguez, lamb and chicken sandwiches as well as poutine, french fries and moroccan tea.the sandwiches (in baguette form) are quite tasty. you get a choice of condiments (mayo, mustard, ketchup, hot sauce) as well as toppings (lettuce, tomato, green olives, onions) then the sandwich goes in the press for that crispy exterior.the french fries are frites. thin, long and crispy. didn't tried them as i wasn't looking to eat more carbs.service is decent enough. not a long wait.place seems to be popular enough even though it's stuck between 2 great places.price is cheap compared to other shops around
