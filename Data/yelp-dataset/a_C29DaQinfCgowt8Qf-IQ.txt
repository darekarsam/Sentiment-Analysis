3	If you are looking for reliable, fast, affordable vietnamese in Mile End, look no further. If you are looking for "wow! amazing!" vietnamese food you may want to go continue looking. While there's nothing wrong with the food at Milani there's nothing exceptional about it either. The menu has a robust collection of soups + rice dishes, but only one vermicelli dish. There are a handful of vegetarian options which is great. Service is friendly and quick and take-out service is available as well.
2	Milani is disappointing if you love Vietnamese.  I ate here before I tried other Vietnamese and I thought it was great.  Then I had good Vietnamese, and now I can't bear to go back.  It's just ... kind of blah.  Nothing terrible but nothing great either.  The  pho is just disappointing, not the burst of flavour you are expecting.  There's not really other Vietnamese in the neighbourhood though, so go if you want too ... but if you are jonsing for a great imperial roll over vermicelli with pho and che ba mau, you are not going to get it here.  But what you are served will be fine and the price is quite reasonable.
2	simple, reasonably priced, pretty clean food in a no-frills space. Heavy on the salt and oil. The husband and wife team are friendly. CASH ONLY.
