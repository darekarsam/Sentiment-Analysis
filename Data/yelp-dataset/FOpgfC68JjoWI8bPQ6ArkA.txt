5	Joe was always on top of things and answered any questions I had. He negotiated a great price for my house and made the house buying experience fun. I've used other agents in the past and I felt like just a number to them but Joe took the time to call me daily  and keep me informed on the transaction. I highly recommend him.
1	Man is a jerk...answers the phone Hello...and like he's drunk! Wow...called to list my Home for sale, but I think NOT! Beyond unprofessional...outright WEIRD!
1	Clearly Joe Pruchnicki, you are as INCOMPETENT as you are RUDE, as I've purchased and sold homes all over the USA & just because my Profile states California does NOT mean I was looking to sell a home in California. The home I was selling (just SOLD) is located in Las Vegas, Nevada near Charleston (in Summerlin). Further, the manner in which I answer my personal home phone is none of your business, as you do NOT pay my phone bill. I have a right to know who's calling. I've never said "Yeah who's this", as I am highly educated (USC Law School) and do not speak the way you have accused me. Be honest, I was the one that determined I did not want to do business with you...remember!FYI: I basically use YELP as my Shit List, which you are now on. : )
5	I don't normally leave reviews on here but buying a home is one of those things where you just need someone you can trust. I just bought my first home in northwest Las Vegas and have been through a couple bad realtors before I was referred to Joe. You tell him what you want and you'll get it. I wasn't shown a bunch of houses that were a waste of my time and ended up with a house I couldn't be happier with. He's very personable and professional which is rare it seems now a days.  Highly recommend  him. He won't waste your time and even made my first home buying experience fun and stress free.
