3	Dr Lesani did a great job removing a cancerous tumor from my husbands kidney.  I would have given him a much higher rating but he was frustratingly slow communicating with the hospital during the 76 hours after surgery, delaying modifications to standing orders like meds, ingestion of food and discharge.  These delays were stressful, painful and potentially hindered recovery.
2	I went to Dr. Lesani a few years ago for a robotic surgery on my kidney.Up until my surgery was over, he was kind, patient, and very caring.AFTER the surgery however, when I would end up in the hospital (for a different condition.  He is a good surgeon, and the surgery was successful)  He became defensive, abrasive, and mean, saying things like "The surgery was successful!"  Um...yeah, I know it was...but what else is going on with my kidney?Not to mention the fact that he left a surgical clip inside me.  His office staff is ok, and his surgical skills are the only reason he is getting 2 stars.  His bedside manner and interpersonal skills need serious help.
5	I was referred to Dr Lesani for his experience in less invasive surgery. He was very professional and explained my procedure with detail and care. I have since recovered fully from my surgery. I recommend him to anyone looking to have surgery.  Interestingly, the other reviews here also mentions their surgery was successful!  (also clips are used in surgery all the time.  I have them from my gallbladder surgery 3 years ago and this does not mean the doctor did anything wrong!)
