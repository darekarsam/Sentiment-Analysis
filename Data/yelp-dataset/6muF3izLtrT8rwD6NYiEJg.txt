5	What a great shop! If you wind up in Vegas and have either forgotten something at home, or have nothing to begin with - this is your one stop shop.I was staying at Caesars for a friend's b-day a couple weeks ago, and forgot a clutch. Not wanting to wander all the way into the Forum shops, I decided to check out what Carina had to offer. Their selection of accessories is unbelievable. I never would have expected this from a little boutique inside Caesars! The woman helping me showed me some adorable stuff, and I wound up leaving with a clutch, earrings, bracelet, and ring - which were all a huge hit that night.I returned the following night before I left to check out the dresses - they have a HUGE selection of brands from BCBG to Gracia to less expensive options.I am considering not packing a suitcase when I come to Vegas next, because they really have everything here (tons of shoes too!).VERY helpful staff!
