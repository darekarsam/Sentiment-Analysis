4	Once in a while everyone decides that they need to start a regime of eating healthily and being physically fit! This was me a few years ago, along with my flatmates and we decided that we wanted to play tennis! Well, after walking past the tennis courts on the Meadows daily we popped in to give it a go. And after playing there for a number of years it is certainly I brilliant sporting facility. There are sixteen courts to choose from, some of the courts are protected more from the wind at the far end of the courts. All of the courts are of a good standard. Whenever we have played in the morning, it has never been really busy, but I suppose after the early risers have played then it does indeed get quite busy. However, a word of warning, at times when I have played in the morning there has been classes of school children there and only selected courts are available. The benefit of going down early though is that we have not had to pay yet. You can become a membership, and the prices are below in Robert's review. If you are going to go down and play in the spring and summer months in the afternoon, then it might be best for you to get a membership. A really good sporting facility, adding already to the many sports you can undertake at the Meadows!

They're not the lush greens of Wimbledon, but for a little knock around they'll do just fine.And I shouldn't really complain about them charging - as Robert says, if you go out of hours you can get on for free anyway. And they need to recoup the cost of maintaining them. In fact, scrap the whole first thing I said - good on them for charging. It does, however, sum up Edinburgh, that we have 16 tennis courts in the middle of our public park area. Pimms anyone?
