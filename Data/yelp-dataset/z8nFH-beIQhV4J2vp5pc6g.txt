5	The Guys at Fitchburg Cycle are top notch. Professional, knowledgeable, and local. They take the time to get you exactly what your looking for and know their customers by name. They are the real deal! #Giant
2	Nice shop but limited to one bike brand. I'm sure the staff must be nice but no one offered any greeting or assistance when I visited. (I was only one of two customers in the store.) I looked at bike carriers for about ten minutes, walked around checking things out for another few minutes but was never acknowledged. Seemed odd for a newer store.
5	Fitchburg Cycle has the best prices and a great staff that is knowledgeable and helpful.  This is a great hometown store and the owner really understands customer service.  I'm from out of town, but this has become my go to shop.
