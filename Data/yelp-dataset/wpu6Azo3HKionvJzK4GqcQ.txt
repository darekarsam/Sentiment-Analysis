4	Yay first review which is surprising. Anyways really cool little cafe. Specializes in organic food. I believe almost everything there is organic. They even have organic beer which I will be trying next time I am there. The service is friendly and the place was packed! Had a delicious savory cheese scone that was nice and fresh along with some ginger beer that was fiery and not to sweet which i quite like. Located at the end of lothian road right at the start of princes st. I will be coming to this diamond in the rough more often especially for the healthy spread of foods and that ginger beer that opens the sinuses!
