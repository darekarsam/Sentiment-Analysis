5	I love this Old Navy.  It is big and clean.  They have a large sale selection too (BONUS).  The employees are always friendly.
3	I love Old Navy for the sales really.  Things priced at the regular price are not quality enough to warrant the price.  This location is good, I hate the clearance area it's always a mess.  But this is without a doubt the friendliest location in the west valley.
1	This location was filthy and disgusting today!   When I tried clothes on the floor was so dirty I had to clean my feet before I could put my shoes back on.   The restroom trash was full of dirty diapers that smelled aweful.   I was there at 9am right when they opened so it's not like they had been busy all day.   There was trash all over the floor by the fitting rooms.  I was really disappointed.
