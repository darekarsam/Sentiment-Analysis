4	I love this place for a few reasons but mostly for the staff. They are welcoming and super helpfull.Get gas pay cash get a discount on price per gal get a wash get gas and pay cash get 25 cents off per gallon. The car washes are $6 $8 $10. The $6 wash gets the crud off our car just fine. They have gaming a icee machine and donuts . The cigarette prices are better than most. Gas prices are lower than most
2	I go everyday on my way to work. And I love corn dogs. They have a hot food section by soft drinks. I get them every morning except when Luis is working the mornings. The oven is always broken when he working. I come in there's nothing hot. He drags his feet and once he did my whole check out with his gf on the phone and told her to hold on as if I was interrupting him. I've been coming the last few months and this morning I was just straight irrtated with this worker! Everyone else is very nice and friendly.
5	They have the friendliest staff of mostly any convenience store in Henderson. They store is always immaculate. Their fountain drink selection is huge as well.Pay debit or cash for a discount on gas. It's a great store and I've even seen Mike Tyson there two times, so keep your earmuffs on!
5	Great location, great staff, and they always have my favourite iced teas & sunflower seeds!
