3	Did drive thru here when I needed a quick meal.  I wish I could sit down and have a nice relaxing meal, but sometimes I don't have enough time - or good company to spend with.  Drive thru here was pretty efficient and they got my order right which is 90% of the service.  The people were nice and the food was what I needed to hit the spot and keep going.
3	Though I drive past this McDonald's every day - twice a day sometimes because it is directly between the house and the school - we have probably only eaten here a couple of times since we have lived in Mint Hill.  I think that those may have even been when we were moving, and stopped to grab a bite so we would have something to eat while we were moving boxes into the house.While the corner location is decent, it is not the easiest business to get into and out of.  You have to do a bit of maneuvering into the Bi-Lo parking lot, and that can be challenging - especially if you are headed back towards Charlotte on Lawyers Road.The good news, such as it is, is that the staff typically does a decent job and are generally friendly.  That is really about everything else you can ask for at a McDonald's, right?
4	Good food and quick service.  Fast drive thru and a nice smile at the window.
3	The "morning woman" could use a lesson in hospitality and just plain kindness. (Yeah, I'm talking about you!) But when I'm taken through the drive thru by my DD at 1am, I really appreciate it when they let me order a fish sandwich, and don't force me to bypass the dollar menu and go home hungry. This happens 2/5 times. Thanks Tarter Sauce!!
1	I never expect much from any mcdonalds... I mean it is fast food. However, when I order a Big Mac, I expect it to taste like a Big Mac. My fries were burnt and my burger tasted like sour fish. I took one bite and had to throw it away. With a mcdonalds on every corner, I'll make sure I never return to this one.
