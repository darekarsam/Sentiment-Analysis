2	Not a big fan of this location.  It's small and one hell of a task to get in and out of.At the end of the parking lot for the Giant Eagle nearby you have no idea where the parking lot ends or where the "road" begins before the station.  The store inside is rather small and much what a convenience store is suppose to be like.  Staff are very friendly however.
3	No complaints here.  Very friendly staff.
