4	Best place to go for an eyebrow wax in the area. They use baby powder and lotion instead of the oil which works great on sensitive skin. After the wax they take their time to get the smaller hairs with tweezers and to even out the shape. Afterwards I didn't have any redness or small bumps I used to get from oil and harsh waxing, and my eyebrows were perfect! They lose one star for the tacky decor. They could definitely use some upgrades to furniture, decor, and some better paint colors. All in all I go there just for my eyebrow wax and they do an excellent job!
4	Very clean salon and friendly staff. When I went in, it was empty so they got started on me immediately. Not too expensive and a full menu of nail and wax services. Definitely coming back.
5	I came here for a pedicure, manicure, and wax. Great service and Jimmy did an amazing job on my nails. I live in west Phoenix and will definitely be back!!!!
