5	I love Ashlie! She is amazing, has been doing my hair for years and have NEVER been disappointed! I look forward to coming here every few months. If you don't know exactly what you want she gives great suggestions. Extensions, cut, color, lashes, wax..she does everything! I definitely recommend Shears Salon!!
5	My review is simple and to the point....Ashlie is the greatest.Moving here from a different state means finding a new salon and that's hard to find! Shes easy to book with which makes my life easier. Goes out of her way to fit you in. Also she knows what shes doing and wont charge you an arm and a leg like   of the other salons around Phoenix.  She stays on top of current styles and will always make you happy. Shes wonderful and a very very good hairdresser. I tell ALL my friends and family to go see her. My mom lives in MI and will now wait till she makes trips here to get her hair done. Everyone has loved her as much as I have.
5	Ashlie is awesome, been coming here for years. Heard about her thru word of mouth and have been visiting her on a regular basis. Ashlie has done extensions for me in the past and they turned out amazing every time and stayed in very well. Ashlie also does color, cut, waxing, men and kids cuts, and deep conditioning treatments. Ashlie always keeps up on the latest trends and is a true professional. This is her own shop with other stylists there as well and you can tell she has a true passion in what she does and takes pride in her local small business.
