3	As you walk in, an ad for Armani Exchange dressed ginos stares at you in the face, and pretty much sums up the essence of this gym.I went to this gym 7 years ago, before I moved. I returned for a couple one day sessions as I was visiting family in the area. A $10 day-pass later, I was back in my old gym. Nothing had changed at all.First floor has 20 or so bikes and threadmill, a hairdresser advertising the gym's tanning booths. All the machines/weights in the basement. No windows, so it's gloomy. Most of the equipment dates quite a bit, and most of it is upper body. For instance there is only one leg press, but about 20 different small barbells (for biceps, triceps, delts). Most of the other machines are extremely dated and uncomfortable. For instance the lateral pulldown machine doesn't have any padding for your legs (your legs hold you down), and the metal just digs into your skin.There is however a very good selection of dumbells (up to 120lbs, as I could see), which probably illustrates where most of the patrons spend their time: with dumbells staring in the mirror.Not a classy/modern gym by any standard, but if you're looking primarily for bikes/dumbells or if it's the only gym where you live, it'll do.
