1	They categorize this company as a professional service...Resortcom is far from being professional or ethical.  Unfortunately I had the horrible experience of dealing with them first hand.  Resortcom plays the middle man between Mexican timeshare resorts and unsuspecting Americans.  They "enforce" questionable contacts from Mexico and use every tactic to intimidate and harass.  It's the old, He Said, She Said and you will be stuck in the middle paying for a timeshare that you can't use or didn't purchase.  I lost over $50,000 due in part to Resortcom.  They could care less about the truth or what is right, it's all about the money....yours!
1	After issues trying to redeem a purchased package, I suggest they start focusing more on the "hospitality" end of their business and less on telemarketing sales. I haven't even arrived to the hotel yet, and I'm already disgusted with the companies level of service. I wouldn't spend another dollar with the organization.... and good luck with making a sell on a timeshare presentation when you can't even get through the initial process to get to the presentation.
1	ResortCom is a very antiquated company without technology to support its customers. Resort has been saying for years that it has been updating its computer system, but after 6 years of not getting it there, it is best to just avoid this company as the operator. Computer use is very limited (Only to pay your yearly fees) and if you buying a timeshare and the operator of your timeshare is ResortCom, I would highly recommend that you DO NOT Buy with ResortCom being the operator.  They will tell and promise you evrything under the mood to get your money. STAY AWAY.
