1	Traveling from San Francisco saw the store ate breakfast next door and then went to go to the uniform store and they were closed even though the sign said they open at 8amWe waited until 815 still no sign of anyone Very disappointing
4	Lots of options in the store, and they offer a 10% Scottsdale healthcare discount- so be sure to mention it.
1	A couple months ago, on a tip from a client, I made a visit to this store. At that time there was a very knowledgeable and helpful person there to help with all my uniform needs. As I was not quite ready to monogram my logo, I waited. Just last week I contacted the store to find out time frame for monogramming. The sales person was not at all helpful as she could not answer one question. Come to find out the helpful person I'd worked with on previous occasion was no longer working there. I should have taken this as a sign of what was to come. I thought I'd have better luck with the manager/owner Linda. NO SUCH LUCK.  Eventhough she stated the mockup of my logo would be completed by the next morning, it in fact took her two days and only after I contacted her twice by email and by phone had she sent the mockup. To add more frustration,  she sent only one of two and the one she sent was incorrect. Her response to me was; 'I have a lot of orders. Which one is yours? Who's calling? ' I again reminded her off my time frame, which was missed. To date, it's been four days past my need by date, she has still not provided the second mockup or has she contacted me re my pending order.   Utterly ridiculous!I would not recommend this place to anyone. What's the point of you can't get what you need when you need it?
