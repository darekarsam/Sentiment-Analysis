1	I brought my car in a few months back due to a transmission fluid leak. They found the problem to be a broken seal where the driveshaft connects. They were great when it came to fixing the problem but they put the blame on the company which I bought the driveshaft from. They told me the seal had broken as a result of the driveshaft being welded too short but when I got a second opinion I was told that it broke because of old age (car has 200,000 miles) when the people at brake masters removed the driveshaft they had disassembled it at the middle joint. They put the blame on the company who sold me the driveshaft saying it was welded too short but when I brought it in to a separate place for a second opinion they measured the driveshaft and told me it was the correct length. The people at brake masters broke my driveshaft and did not want to take responsibility for it which took $500 for me to replace. The staff here is dishonest and I would not recommend it to anyone.
1	Break Masters replaced the gasket on the intake manifold on my engine and got particle pieces in my engine. This ruined my engine. I had to have another dealer replace the engine because I would never never take my truck back here ever again.They use the shoot approach. I had previously taken my truck in for air conditioner problems ....$1000 later had to keep taking it back because it was not fixed then another $2000 to fix the air conditioner. they do not have any idea what they are doing.Go to Spooners instead! automotive north phoenix....you'll be glad you did!
