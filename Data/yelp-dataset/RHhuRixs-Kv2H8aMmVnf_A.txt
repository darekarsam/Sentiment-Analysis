3	Great decor and large, expansive areas. Lots of stained glass and multiple seating areas. Close to table games and video poker at the bar. A great meeting location when visiting Sunset Station.
3	Sunset Station's website indicates a daily happy hour is offered at the Gaudi Bar that includes $5 martinis.  Our bartender provided a list of the drinks offered and I noticed the non discounted prices ranged from $5 to $6 - what a deal!  My wife ordered a Hello Kitty (Absolute vodka, Hiriam Walker white cacao,  1/2 and  1/2, OJ and strawberry puree) while I chose an Orange Creamsicle (Ketel One vodka, Hiriam Walker white cacao,  1/2 and  1/2 plus OJ). The major problem with both drinks was neither was particularly cold because the bartender failed to cool the martini glasses or stirred them long enough with ice.
4	Used to really love going to this place when a group called the Busker Kings played music there. Shawn and Arrow were two of the most amazing musicians, we spent every night they were playing there drinking and having friends join us.  Shawn Eiferman is one of my favorite musicians in Vegas and we tend to follow him whereever he goes. Not a fan of the guy who is there now who touts that he was on the Voice, too arrogant and loud.
4	The Gaudi Bar is a bit of a trek as it is in the Sunset Station Hotel in  Henderson, NV. Nine miles off the strip. The reason to go... The Gaudi Bar.Inspired by the Spanish architect Antoni Gaudi, the Gaudi bar embraces the traditions of Catalan Modernism and it is an amazing surrealistic experience.This is unlike any bar you will find, not only in the Vegas area, but also in the US. The architecture goes beyond the circle bar and into the casino area. The color, lights, and molten cavernous ceilings draw you in and overwhelm you with curiosity and awe.
