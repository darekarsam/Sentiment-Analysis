4	This is a shoe store that is joined with Sloan, the women's boutique downstairs from it. Great selection here! Again, like downstairs, the sales associates are very friendly and helpful. They've got tons of shoes for you to browse through, and a wide range of styles. They've also got handbags up there, and pretty nice ones too. I didn't find them to be too pricey. Go check them out!
4	Welcome to shoe heaven, ladies. My heart skips a beat as soon as someone says, "shoe shopping", and Step by Sloan is a great place that sends my heart a flutter. Step is the sister store of the clothing boutique, Sloan, and offers a whole slew of gorgeous shoes for a variety of tastes. The price point for summer sandals and heels is pretty vast, at $50-$500. Regardless of the wide price range, Sloan carries a great variety of trendy, quality shoes. They offer a smattering of shoes from Cole Haan, DVF, Dolce Vita, Giuseppe Zanotti, Kors, Rosegold and many more. They also had a sizeable sale section with current season styles - saweet! The store is beautifully laid out with tons of light from the upteen windows. The staff is accommodating and definitely lets you shop around. When needed, the staff was helpful and polite and made some great suggestions. They also have a great website, if you wanted to do a bit of browsing before you stop in: http://sloanboutique.com/shoes.html While the focus is shoes, Step also hosts the cocktail and formal dress section of Sloan. This is a sweet little spot to grab all of your necessary outfit makers - shoes, bags and accessories!
4	Step holds a special place in my shopper's heart because long before the DNC,NM and Nordstroms considered Charlotte to be "on the map" and before free shipping on the internet, Step quietly offered fashionable women of Charlotte a place to treat their feet and make their party dresses happy.Good service, cute pooches, off beat brands and a mixed set of price points make this a Charlotte staple!
