5	We love this store. It is an artists haven and I have a little artist on my hands. From making tshirts, drawing, painting, creating wreathes, and baking, this is always the place we come to.
5	Amazing Staff.  They are the best a framing.  Such great quality and awesome service.  They go out of their way to go above and beyond at this location.
4	This Michael's is a lot larger and it has much more selection and variety of products than the Michael's in Toronto.  It is a very busy time of the season and the store was kept very well, clean, organized and everything was easy to find.  The lines are fast moving and we didn't have to wait.This is probably the nicest Michael's we've seen.
