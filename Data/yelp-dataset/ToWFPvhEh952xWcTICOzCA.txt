5	Great staff! They are very friendly and helpful. I come here whenever I need to buy a small gift and a card and want to avoid the crowd at Walmart. It's a pretty slow location but it makes card buying easier.
4	I love this store. It's always a quite place to find great cards! I love the quite time I get here reading all the funny cards :) The staff is great too, because they never judge me when I am there reading cards for 45 mins. ! The stores have a way better selection than anywhere else and they also have great one of a kind gifts too. Also during the holidays, nothing beats a Keepsake ornament. I can fill a whole Christmas tree with all the Keepsakes I have! My mom would always buy, send and give Hallmark cards and that has just been something that has stuck with me. I know that nowadays you can find Hallmark cards almost anywhere, but it's not the same as when you actually go to a real Hallmark store. If you haven't been into a Hallmark in awhile or at all it's something to checkout.
5	Each time I go into this store, I receive the best service. They are so friendly and helpful and are willing to help you find what you need. It's always such a pleasant experience.
