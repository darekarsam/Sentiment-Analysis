2	On my way through Charlotte we stopped at both Niche's, and this one didn't seem to be that great.Sure, they have Johnny Cupcakes garb, but I liked the Southend location much better. The Southend store has a lot more clothing, and Good Charlotte goes there. Trust me.
4	Hipster boutique for art, toy, and clothes junkies.  Affordable pop art prints decorate the studio.  It is anti-Republican and pro Obama all the way!  I loved the green and white promotional print for Obama in Charlotte entitled, Chi-Towns Finest!  The clerk, Kevin, is fun to talk to, and he is definitely passionate about clothes and art, especially vinyl toys.  This is a new sensation that I am somewhat unfamiliar with, but I thought the ones on display were creative and interesting.  They are participating in the NoDA art crawl by having a turntablist and a Munny Show.  Munnies are little blank vinyl toys that you can paint and draw your own designs on.  I will definitely come back to pick up a pair of cool PF Flyers, or maybe even a funky kaleidoscope!
3	An extension of Niche in South End, Niche MKT offers more of a variety of items and seems like a great place to buy a gift for a hipster guy. They've got a selection of T-shirts, sneakers, posters and novelty toys. I was happy to see the store expand into NoDa, and I generally feel much more welcome at this location than in the South End one, where the employees have been pretty apathetic to my presence.
