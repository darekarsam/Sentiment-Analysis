4	Dirt cheap and very good. Tony is correct it is not an elegant place but when you want BBQ I think this is one of the better places in town.
4	This place is tucked in between some junk yards and check cashing places. It has no windows and is just a brick rectangle. The inside is slightly more appealing with covered wagon light fixtures and saddle gear nailed to the walls. The staff is southern and kind of friendly and rude at the same time, which in my book is fricken' hilarious. The menu is laminated and the pork sandwiches are served wrapped in parchment with no plate. Can you say awesomeness? Choice of pork or beef bbq, sliced or shredded. Bbq plates available too sopping with delicious bbq sauce, vinegary and savory.  Hush puppies, you ask? Hell yeah. Want slaw? You got it. Buttered Texas toast? In your face, baby!Just go already...I know your mouth is watering.Side Note: There are alot of people out there who like to take sides with their food. The most famous case of this was the new england clam chowder vs. manhattan clam chowder debate which of course sparked the now famous Chowder War of 1920.The same holds true for Barbecue or BBQ for short.Some people like it dry and dip it in sauce.And some people like it wet seeped in vinegar.It's cooked the same way essentially...slow.Taking sides on this issue, or any food issue is ridiculous. They're both friggin' good and I'd eat either style of BBQ any day.
4	This gem is located in a squat brick structure on a grim stretch of North Tryon, not where you would expect to find a good restaurant, but then again, isn't that so often the case?  Better than any road sign is the wafting scent of hickory hanging over the road as you approach.  I believe I could find this place blindfolded.In compliance with the federal regulations regarding BBQ joint decor, this place looks as if the crates holding all the old props from Bonanza! blew up in the middle of the room and everything lodged in the walls.Service is super-prompt and friendly, you can sit and watch the pitmaster doing his thing in the corner, and what can I say?  It's just really good and tasty.  It's not going to blow your mind, but this is a good place.It makes you wonder why people pay a premium to eat at places like Mac's Speed Shop (they're good too, but at twice the price).Anyway, carry on.
5	Consistently the best "purist" BBQ in CLT. Meat is cooked over **real** wood in a pit I would be proud to have in my home (yes, I am a BBQ freak). Wife is instructed to have these guys cater my wake.Most/all the BBQ posers these days cook with gas or electricity. It ain't the same folks. Before you go into a BBQ restaurant, drive around back. Woodpile? If not, keep driving. Is the wood neatly stacked? If so, be suspicious because a fellow smoking meat at 4AM isn't typically neat with his pile. Does the restaurant only seem to smoke during dinner hours? We've got a chain joint near us which cooks electrically, but has a smoke-emitting stack- kinda like a smoke-sign. I refuse to set foot in the place on principal.Hickory House does pork, beef, and chicken. The beef and chicken may be good (can't say), but this **is** North Carolina, folks. The only BBQ worth having in NC is pork. Never order french onion soup at a chinese place, I say. Go to Texas if you want beef.As others have said, this place is a nondescript, brick, rectangle in an area of North Tryon which has seen better days. Ever heard of the Hidden Valley Kings? Lock your car and hide your valuables. Speaking from personal experience, here.This is one of those buildings I wish could talk. The restaurant obviously started out as a road-house of sorts back when this part of the world was out in "the woods". I bet it has a ghost or two roaming around. Looks like the kind of place your parents' doctor/lawyer/accountant met his receptionist for "overtime" work back in the 60's.Personally, I am partial to their chopped BBQ sammich, brunswick stew, and hush puppies. If you're lucky/blessed/living right, your sammich will have some crunchy "outside" in it. You can get the sammich with or without slaw- your choice. I alternate.Brunswick stew is worth driving across town for (I do).The hushpuppies are not health food, but they are addictive. We start out with an order as an appetizer. Don't know where they come from, but they will contribute to my early demise, I'm sure.If you're like me and despise MBA-driven, vinyl restaurants, Hickory House ought to be on your short list. This is the place I hold up as the finest example in CLT of the way BBQ is supposed to be done. Even if the food wasn't 5-star, it is worth a trip just so you can tell your kids about it someday. There are fewer and fewer of these places left every day and we'll all be poorer when they're gone.
5	This is hands down the best pork BBQ I've ever had and I like to consider myself an amateur BBQ connoisseur as I've eaten at every "good" local BBQ joint in almost every state in the South, and some not in the south as well.  Its one of the big reasons I moved to charlotte and everytime a friend comes in from out of town I make sure we go there and NO ONE is disappointed. I ALWAYS get the small pork plate, if you want to get the best part of it, make sure to ask for the BURNT ENDS, dont just order and hope to get some, but ask for them specifically, easily the most flavourful part of the pig.  The sweet tea is magnificent (I dont trust a BBQ joint that doesnt serve it) The hush puppies are unbelievable, once again, probably the best ones I've ever had, and the brunswick stew is hands down some of the best slop I've ever had.The staff is all very friendly and I'm my sweet tea never dips below the half full mark.  I just wish this place would get more business because everytime I go there there are 2 other tables of people there at the most, and the restaurant is very spacious, the last thing I want is for this gem to go out of business.
3	If you're scared off by areas of town that aren't the best, you probably should go elsewhere.  There are plenty of other places to eat.  This isn't the ghetto, but it is right next to it.If you prefer to have fancy decor and modern furnishings, you might want to check out another location.  Not of the Old Hickory House (because I don't think there is one).  But of some other restaurant.  Mike K.'s characterization of old Bonanza! props blowing up is not inaccurate.If you need another, think of an old-time steak house.  The walls are paneled.  The interior is dark.  Even the wall sconces - which you would probably never hear them called - are little covered wagons.  In the one nod to the current century you might find, they do have compact fluorescent bulbs in them.  It also might be the only way they can keep said covers from bursting into flames.Over in one corner is indeed The Pit - or at least some representation of it.  It is a bit dark inside, even well before it gets dark outside.  So I can't tell exactly what is over there.  When you order, the man I will call the Pitmaster gets your order and pulls some meat out of The Pit and prepares it for you - generally this means chopping it - and then you get the freshly prepared meat on the plate, right to your table.There are a couple of downsides to the Old Hickory House.I personally don't care about the location.  I lived in an area similar to this for ten years.  So that didn't bother me.  It was like going home again.  But if this is the sort of thing you care about, you may want to think twice.I didn't really mind the 50s steakhouse kitsch, but it could use a bit more light.  Not saying they need an atrium or skylight or anything, and I understand why they may not want windows now that they operate next to the ghetto, but maybe they could turn up the brightness on the interior lighting or something so you don't think there is a Barbecue Mafia hit happening in the back corner.  At 2pm.I did mind the service.  Just a bit.  While others mentioned the service was speedy, I will agree - but only after the initial contact.  It took probably 15 minutes to get someone to acknowledge that we were there.  This may not be a big deal during a dinner rush on a Friday night.  But in the middle of the afternoon, when there are only three tables, and there are at least six employees standing behind the counter while only one (the eldest by a good margin) waited on tables?  Unacceptable.  After she came by to take our order, both food and drinks kept up a good pace however.I would suggest ordering the sauce on the side.  I get that some people may like it, but I really didn't.  Like Dave S., I ordered the beef and pork plate, and I also much preferred the pork.  That pork in fact may be some of the best pork in town.  But the sauce was so thick and heavy that it killed the taste completely.  The menu does say that the sauce comes on the meat by default but it needs a more stern warning!  A little of this stuff goes a long way - either it needs to be on the side by default or they need to be a little less heavy with it.I did find it interesting that they are old school.  No sides to speak of (and no, fries, hush puppies and beans don't really count).  You won't even find macaroni and cheese here.  But the puppies are pretty good - crispy on the outside, if a little too chewy on the inside for my preference.  The beans are indeed tasty.  If I go back I might go for just some un-sauced chopped pork and beans.Sweet Tea Report: Excellent, sweet goodness.  Among the best in town and awesomely drinkable.  The only problem I had was keeping the glass full enough to keep it flowing down my throat.
5	When I was 15 I bought a t-shirt from the Salvation Army thrift store from a BBQ joint with the words "Praise the Pig, Pass the Napkins" emblazoned on the front. I still own that shirt and every time I wear it I get a craving for Old Hickory House.The pulled pork is absolutely delicious: smokey yet tangy and they certainly give you enough of it. I have it on good authority that the ribs and chicken fingers are also tasty (though I still don't understand why my coworker ordered chicken fingers at a BBQ joint). Do you like hushpuppies? Of course you like hushpuppies. Get them. Crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. Wonderful. The cole slaw is sweet and creamy and makes an excellent addition to the pulled pork, as it always should.Oh and there is texas toast. Mmmm.The dining room isn't much to look at (I actually find the covered wagon sconces a little creepy) and the waitresses will rag on you a little, but its all in good fun. If you cant lighten up enough to enjoy the experience you probably shouldn't be there in the first place.But of course you can enjoy, y'all are Yelpers.
2	I went to the Old Hickory House on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  I was looking forward to sampling some good BBQ.  I left very disappointed.  The restaurant was not very busy.   There were about 4 or 5 booths and one table with a big party of about 10 or 12 people.  The decor has definitely not changed recently.  The interior is dark with wooden paneled walls.  It looked like no one had touched a thing since it opened in 1957 which is not a good thing.  There was some paint peeling from AC duct running across the dining room and some of the chairs were patched with duct tape.  Overall the place looked like it could use a good scrub down.  This is not a bad thing, but for me if a place is like this the food better be very good.  The waitress let me know I could sit anywhere.  After I sat down the waitress came over to take my drink order and I also placed my order for lunch.  I ordered the large beef & pork plate which comes with 2 sides.  For the sides I choose baked beans and hushpuppies.  I requested to have them put the BBQ sauce on the side because I wanted to taste the meat without any sauce.  I took a while to get my food.  The waitress came by after about 4 or 5 minutes and appoligized because I sat down after the big table.  I told her I understood and it wasn't too much longer before my food came out.  Everything looked pretty good.  The pork & beef were both chopped.  I forgot to tell the waitress I wanted my beef sliced, but oh well.  I tried the pork first.  It was tender and that was the only good thing about it.  It was lukewarm and very bland tasting.  There was no smoke flavor at all.  I tried adding some of the BBQ sauce.  The sauce was thin with chunks of onions I think in it.  I thought it would have a vinegary tang, but it was sweet and had a citrus or fruit flavor.  It did not compliment the meat at all.  The beef was also tender, but again it didn't have much flavor and was also lukewarm.  The beans looked good with a thick sauce which is how I like them.  Like the meat they were very bland.  The tasted like they had just come out of a can.  The only redeeming thing about the meal were the hushpuppies.  The were crispy and hot with an excellent flavor.  The meal also comes with Texas toast.  One piece was brown on one side, burnt on the other.  The other piece was not toasted at all.  This kind of sums up what I think is going on at the Old Hickory House.  It probably was a great BBQ place at one time, but now, at least for my visit, there was no attention to detail of the food coming out of the kitchen.  The just is no quality control in the kitchen.  The prices are in line with other BBQ places I have eaten at in Charlotte and the food was not bad.   I have to say the service was excellent.  My waitress did a great job.  But with all the other choices out there my recommendation is to go somewhere else.
5	Yelp, you have served me well...once more. I was suffering through one of  the longest road trips I have ever endured (ATL to DC) and we had to stop for gas. Did a quick search for barbecue near me and I found out Old Hickory was 5 minutes down the road. We walk in and are greeted by the cutest bartender/waitress ever. Behind her all I could see was open fire and what I'd describe as meat heaven. We ordered a pulled pork sandwich and a barbecue chicken sandwich and all were pleased.Excellent recommendation for a miserable road trip.
2	Old Hickory House is not very far from my work, so I decided to have lunch there one day.  When I stepped in, I was transported back in time.  The look of the restaurant, with its wood panel walls and Western Sizzlin-esque decor was definitely an interesting touch.  There were fewer than 10 people there, so a waitress immediately came and took my drink order while I mulled over the menu.  I finally decided on the pork and beef plate (I requested the pork be chopped and the beef be sliced), with BBQ beans and hush puppies as the sides.  Apparently you can request the BBQ sauce to be on the side, but I neglected to do so.  Less than 5 minutes later, my food came out.  The beef was sliced between 1/8" and 1/4" thick, and the texture of it reminded me more of roast beef than a beef brisket.  There was no smoke flavor to it whatsoever.  The taste was okay -- not really overwhelming or remarkable.  The pork was finely chopped.  The bites I managed to take without sauce on it were okay -- again, nothing really remarkable.  The sauce didn't really do much for me.  It almost seemed like a sort of tomato-ish gravy.The beans were bland, and there were pieces of pork dispersed within the beans.  That's all I'll say about that.  The best part of the meal, in my opinion, was the hush puppies.  With the exception of one rogue hush puppy (that was probably from a much earlier batch), the hush puppies were very crispy on the outside and just right on the inside.  Plus they were round, unlike the tubular-shaped hush puppies I'm used to seeing here in the Carolinas.  To summarize: the service was top notch, and the food... well, not so much.A similar review with pictures can be found at http://www.bigwaynerbbq.com/2011/01/26/review-old-hickory-house-charlotte-nc/
5	Well well this might be my favorite new spot for bbq (pulled or chopped pork of course, thats what the definition of bbq is in these parts).  Sure the purists say that it should just be pork with a vinegar base sauce, with maybe a little tomato.  I don't know how to properly describe the sauce served here.  It was tangy, thick..definitely had tomato and vinegar, but it wasn't runny.  There were shreds of pork in the sauce.  It was simmered savory goodness.  If your definition of good bbq is Mac's pork smothered with their sweet syrup sauce, you probably won't like Old Hickory.  But if you enjoy the unique bbq you can get from places like Bessinger's mustard base in North Charleston, Pam's buffet in Hartsville, the original Lexington Barbecue...then make a trip to Old Hickory House.  I will report back after I try the ribs. Oh and about the atmosphere.  Yea the neighborhood is a little sketch.  But once inside the restaurant I think the ambiance is right on point for a classic Carolinas bbq spot.  I had carryout so I can't say much about the service.  But honestly I don't care when I'm eating for under 10 bucks.
5	I was lucky enough to be taken here by my buddy Johnny L. while in town visiting for my job. Wow, all I can say is amazing. I felt like I got my total Pork Bang for my buck. I got sweat tea, a small pork plate with hush puppies and brunswick stew. All was amazing. I'd kill for some more brunswick stew right about now. If I had this place near me I would be 100 pounds heavier.The bread was scrumptious with the Pork, and was happily given more when asked. The prices are unbelievably cheap.
5	My first visit to this place was fantastic. I loved the barbecue.  I wish I were closer so I could pop in more often.  I usually love the vinegar based BBQ but Old Hickory House's sauce was delicious.  I'm now a convert.  The building did seem a little sketchy but once I was inside and seated, the waitress really made me feel welcome.  She explained how long the place has been around (a LONG time) and how everything is cooked and why it's so good.  She was super friendly and talkative.  I highly recommend this place and hope more people check it out!
5	Best barbecue in Charlotte, in my opinion! This place kicks ass on all accounts...pulled pork, ribs, hushpuppies, Brunswick stew, you name it. Eat your heart out, Mac's...hate it for ya. This is real deal eastern NC style barbecue, my favorite, despite being raised on sweet KC-style sauces and Memphis dry rubs. The tangy tomato-ey vinegar based sauce is right up my alley and OHH nails it. Hushpuppies are sweet southern style and so crispy and yummy. Ribs fall off the bone and come unsauced so you can do them up to your liking. Friendly folks, great food, local business... that's alright with me! And for those concerned about the neighborhood, it isn't any worse than eating in parts of Noda or Plaza Midwood, in my opinion. C'mon people, don't be scurrrred!!!
3	Drove all the way here from the other side of town, and wow! YUCK! Old chicken, I don't eat pork, so that was not an option.  My kid liked the pork sandwich, but my chicken sandwich was terrible, don't think I'll be going back, so disappointing!
5	I'm still in Charlotte on business, and decided to go find me some more BBQ.  I looked online for something, and while I had plenty of choices, however I wanted to say close to where I am staying.I found the Old Hickory House.  When I got there, I was a little suspicious, quite honestly the place looks a little sketchy, a plain brick building with no windows.  It looks like it may have at one time been a bar.I went in and ordered a small beef and pork plate with a side of Brunswick stew and small salad.  The beef and pork were both very tender juicy and flavorful, but the Brunswick stew was to die for!  I thought I had eaten the best in the world (I won't mention where, because theirs is still good) but the bar was definitely raised tonight!If I lived here I'd definitely be a regular!
4	I think some ppl read the reviews then make reviews based off others... Meaning... whats up with all the reviewers saying... "sketchy"????anyway.. to the point.. this place it great. love the food. in the summer time you can smell the hickory wood smoke from down the street.. (talking about free advertising)the B. Stew is to die for.... well maybe not to die.. but you get the point!i'm not a Chopped pork kinda guy. Rather have the pulled kind.Go in and try it. "Sketchness" and all.... You'll make it out alive. And if you don't.. well at least you had a Great last meal.
1	I found this restaraunt on Yelp and after reading the rave reviews, I couldn't wait to try it!  Everyone had mentioned the "sketchy" location. It didn't seem THAT bad to me.  Yes, the interior is old and dark, but I've had some really awesome bbq in similar places.  We arrived about 2pm, so we were very hungry and wanted to try a little of everything.  The waitress was very nice and helped us choose how and what to order.  We ended up with two small rib plates (these have 2 ribs each) and 1/2 pound of chopped beef and 1/2 pound of chopped pork.  We got beans, fries, hushpuppies, and Brunswick stew as the sides, and we ordered sweet tea to drink.  Each pork plate came with 2 slices of Texas toast.  Our bill totaled $31.31 before a tip.The food was ready very quickly.  I tried the Brunswick stew first. It tasted ok, but it was barely warmer than room temperature. The hushpuppies had lots of positive reviews, so I tried one of those. It was cold and unremarkable, not the crispy outer/ moist inner deliciousness I had been promised.  I decided to move on to the meats.  The meats usually come with sauce already on them, but we ordered our sauce on the side.  I've traveled and lived all over the south from Florida to NC to Texas and I've never seen bbq sauce like this.  It was fairly thin, like a cross between a tomato base sauce and a vinegar sauce, but it was chunky with what seemed to be onions and maybe corn and small meat chunks.  It looked more like a vegetable soup than bbq sauce.  There was a distinct citrus flavor that I first thought might be orange juice, but was later told it was lemon.  The sauce was an epic fail for me and there is no other kind of sauce available there.  The ribs were ok, but bland since I hated the sauce and had to eat them dry.  The chopped beef was dry and bland and not just because it didn't have sauce. It was just dried out.  The chopped pork was definitely the better of the two, but still not good enough to even make me want to give this place two stars..  The sweet tea was good and the Texas toast could have been good if it was warm and not room temperature.  I almost forgot to mention the fries.  That's because there just wasn't much to say about them other than that there weren't many of them.My friend and I both felt the same way about this place.  We find it very hard to believe that so many people love this food and love this sauce.   I would have paid $35 to have known the truth and skipped eating here.  Next time, I'll try somewhere else.
5	I have visited over 100 barbecue restaurants in NC. This is my favorite. They have the best Brunswick Stew I have ever tasted and the cue is totally tasty! I love the pork and beef so I often get a combo with the baked beans and stew. Oh Lord, I need to drive to Charlotte right now.!
2	I read the reviews for this restaurant on yelp and decided to gamble because it seemed either people really loved this eatery or hated it. After arriving and tasting a bit of the food, I found that i joined the ranks of the latter. The Positives: The hush puppies were amazing. The Negatives: The brunswick stew came as a small and tepid paste that had the taste of stale vegetable soup and had the consistency of crushed saltine crackers. The bbq pork and beef was dried out and the house sauce over both meats was flavorless and thin. The texas toast was alright, being the only warm thing served to us on our table.
5	I love this place! Awesome pulled pork with the perfect amount of sauce on top. One thing I do miss is the chili they had YEARS ago as a side. It was some of the best I've ever tasted. I love the Brunswick stew and beans. Hush puppies are just a tad overdone on the outside but they're still great! I miss the old BBQ bread they used to include but the Texas Toast they replaced it with is fine.Great iced-tea. You won't find better BBQ within 100 miles of this place.Your pal,Walter
5	this place is the greatest BBQ joint ive ever been to. last time i came to visit family in the area Old Hickory House was the first place i went once i got into my rental car. i returned here once a day for the entire trip after that and in that time sampled the whole menu. the service here is great, helpful, and with a big smile!
4	The place is pretty much original from the fifties. It's dark and rustic. I had the ribs, fries, hushpuppies, and Texas toast and finished everything but the fries and toast. I usually get the rib sauce on the side, but this time I did not. I think I like it better with the sauce actually on the ribs, but it is quite messy that way. The iced tea was great and the service was very friendly and on the spot with refills. Will return.
1	Where I'll never eat BBQ again and it's not the BBQ. I have been known to travel for good BBQ as do a lot of BBQ lovers. This place was one of the best I have ever found. If you went there for lunch the building was packed. So I started to go after the lunch crowd had left so I could take my time and get better service too. It is a dreary atmosphere in the dining room with no windows and the lights were always dim. I don't remember why I started eating there but it was the best BBQ around.After a year or two I noticed that the bbq prices had become marginal on being practical. So, I started ordering a less expensive item, the Brunswick stew. They had the best by far I had ever tasted. Over the years I would stop in ever few weeks by myself and sometimes with a friend or two and I would have the stew while my party would have the "Q". It was then that I first noticed that the guy at the register, (the owner) would often make mistakes on the amount of the check, always to his favor. If we caught it he would always apologize and we would pay and leave. Later I was in with a friend that had never eaten there before and as we finished I suggested we tally the check. I pointed out to my friend that the register guy will probably charge too much and we should already know how much we were to pay. Sure enough, he charged too much and I looked at my friend and spoke loudly enough for some of the other patrons to here, "I told you he would charge too much!" Nothing was said by register guy just an apology. He corrected the check took our money and we left.        I never took anyone there again although not long after that I went and I ordered the stew as usual and as I took my first bite I thought it had a "odd" flavor. I had been eating this stew for years and I knew the taste explicitly and for it to have an "odd" taste was enough for red flags to go up. I called over the waitress and declared that the stew was not good. She said no problem and she would get me another bowl. Taking my bowl away she went through the swinging doors to the kitchen and soon returned with another bowl and set it in front of me and affirmed that the cook had just made it this morning. So I took a bite and it had the same "odd" flavor. I can't say for sure, but it did remind me of the smell I have experienced while in a restroom. Then I looked over at the kitchen door and noticed the cook sheepishly peering out at me. That's when I had a very strange feeling. I wonder if he and the register guy put something in my stew as to get back at me for embarrassing him when I was last in. No...they wouldn't do that would they? Maybe if... no, I can't believe that anyone would do such a thing!  So,  I got up and left never to return again. I'm just going to leave it up to you. What do you think?         If you ever go there to eat and the register guy charges you too much...maybe you shouldn't say anything if by chance you ever plan on returning!
4	You can hardly tell this was a restaurant from the outside but the food was very good.  I am not a BBQ expert, but I thought the ribs and chicken was terrific.
5	Best BBQ and Brunswick stew in Charlotte hands down.
4	You know it's good BBQ when it looks like a road side pit stop. The service was great--super attentive and my sweet tea always had a refill nearby. The beef BBQ was tender and juicy. The hush puppies were excellent, and the coleslaw standard. I also tried the brunswich stew which was surprisingly delicious.
4	This place is quite delicious.  I picked up a big platter with a few meats (I think I got chopped beef, pork, chicken, and ribs).  The chicken and ribs were ok, not amazing, but pretty decent.  The pulled pork and beef were great with the sauce they gave to us with it.  The hushpuppies were amazing, best we ever had.  The brunswick stew was also delicious...I have never had it before but it was great and super thick and filling.  You can eat it with a fork.  Overall I would recommend this place.
5	There is a reason why this place got 5 stars. It is literally as good as Carolina BBQ gets. They serve a mixed platter of meats which is well-worth the 15 bucks that they charge. The mixed platter is also enough meat for a small army.The key to this place is the BBQ sauce. It is so good that thinking of it makes my mouth water. The sauce has this incredible vinegar tang that you can't describe. You'll just need to try it for yourself. Pulled pork is literally as good as it gets.The wait staff has attitude and is pretty entertaining. When I'm in NC I go to this place over and over again because it is truly a gem.
2	After reading reviews of this resturant I wanted to give it a try. After trying so many bar-b que resturants and not finding a great one yet. I decided to give it a try. So we and my girlfriend went for early dinner and I have to say it wasn't much to talk about. I ordered ribs and beef with sides of hushpuppies and fries. The meat had a nice taste to it but the sauce is very different. It tasted more like a watered down pizzia sauce. I guess the worst part of the meal was the fries and hushpuppies. The fries had a weird taste I can't describe and the hushpuppies might of been good but them came out really cold. I really wanted to like the food. The atmosphere was like i was eating from the movie Fried Green Tomatoes. I just hope the meat was from beef and pork. All kidding aside I will not go back still on the search for great bar-b-que.
3	Preface: I'm not a huge barbeque fan. I'll eat it (and even enjoy it), but it's not something I'm regularly hankering for.Another CLT institution that's as old as dirt that I've only recently made it to. My office goes out for lunch to celebrate birthdays and this was a recent coworker's pick. This is about as authentic as you can get - meat of all kinds roasted and chopped right there. On my visit, at the recommendation of others, I had the chopped pork sandwich with a side of Brunswick stew. Both were off the charts - lots of flavor, especially the stew. The meat is dripping in vinegar sauce and the stew is hearty. While you wait on your order, they give you a basket of hush puppies with butter. I could live on these. If you like your sweet tea on the sweeter side, you won't be disappointed.Be prepared for sarcasm from your server, though. They've all been doing this for quite a long time and have developed a rough-around-the-edges approach.Chad E. gives a very accurate description of the restaurant itself - dark wood paneling and very kitschy decor. Think a 50s western movie tribute. It's one big room where everything is dark wood (even the walls) and covered in wrought iron farm equipment, covered wagons, and steer horns. I would imagine this is how people in China or Japan think of Texas.
5	After reading many of the reviews for this place, I agree with several:  this place is as good as Carolina BBQ gets.The building is nothing short of scary:  less-than-great neighborhood, old, dingy, no windows, older than dirt...I never would have entered this place had the reviews on here not been so positive.There's a big smoker right inside that you can look into.  The guy operating it will tell you all about the meat, too.  From the time I ordered, it took about 5 minutes to get our food, as he cut the pork and beef right there after we ordered.  No steam trays or tubs of warm juice!Their hush puppies are amazing; best I've ever had.  They also dropped a plate of Texas toast onto the table, which I would typically ignore, as I'm not a big bread fan.My girlfriend ate a piece, and commented on how good it was.  Next thing I know, I downed two pieces, and would have eaten more, had we not already finished it.How do they make it so good?  It's just toast!I've eaten at many good BBQ places in Charlotte, but they were just good.  This place was excellent:  great service, great food, and a positive all-around experience.  Definitely worth driving up to the UNCC area to visit.
1	I finally tried this place for dinner on Saturday evening. For the life of me I cannot understand why so many rave about it. I was thoroughly disappointed. All the reviews mention how old the place is so I certainly didn't expect much. But I cannot stress enough how bad it really is.  Also the men's restroom looked like it had not been cleaned in a year.  I arrived at about 6:00 PM and there were just three tables occupied.  Telling for the dinner hour on a Saturday.  When I left 45 minutes later, still just three tables occupied.They serve beer but only offer the usual domestic light beers and the like. I admit I am a bit of a beer snob so the lack of a decent beer list was a big no-no for me.  And they were out of several of their usual selections to make it worse. But all that could have been overcome if the Q was top notch. I just didn't think it was good at all. When you walk in, you see a big smoker behind a counter.  It did not appear to be operating. There was no aroma of smoke or BBQ at all in the place. I had a combo plate with chicken, ribs, and brisket.  All were clearly not fresh or even recently made.  All the meats were very dry, tough, and served cold.  And the ribs were the strangest cut I have ever seen.  Must have been some kind of alien pig or something. They were awful.  Sides were limited and were not good at all either. Two bright spots though:  First, the sauce is very good. A perfect blend of vinegar and other spices. A good thing because you needed to drown the meat in the stuff to make it edible.  Second, the service was outstanding.  Bottom line:  Old Hickory House is just coasting on their history.  Too many other options for Q that are far better to justify returning. I will not.
3	Pretty good barbecue. Dark,1950's, Bonanza interior. Friendly servers. Expensive.
5	I can only speak for the ribs because I am on the low carb thing. I get mine with no sauce, they are the best ribs I have had in the charlotte area.    To get ribs  this good I was driving an hour away.    My daughter loves the chicken, beans, and fries. I can not say anything about the sauce because I have not tried it and when I do have sauce I always have it on the side, to many opinions on what makes a good sauce and I would not want the sauce to ruin a great rib. These ribs need no sauce anyway!  I love BBQ ribs and I am very happy to find ones so good so close.
4	If you are in the mood for old school ribs, this is the place to be. Everything is original there. Everything. Well, minus the TVs, which are on the Carolina News channel and not blaringly loud. Everything is quite tasty, but the hush puppies are crazy good. The sweet tea is sugar coma inducing and one of my favorites in the Queen City. You do not leave hungry. I ate all the ribs on my plate, the hush puppies, and a half gallon of tea. I took home the chicken and fries for another filling meal at a later date. It's a shame the place is such a drive for me. Will be back.
5	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM! The barbecue is flavorful, moist and delicious! The Texas toast is always to buttery and delicious and the restaurant is cool because if the old-fashion look. I will be back soon!
4	Perfect atmosphere. Nothing fancy. Tasty bbq. Very friendly waiter. Hush puppies n stewReview for 5/18/2010
4	Dont go!! Thought we were in for a treat with the 4 star rating and no negative feedback. We ordered pork and ribs - Very disappointed. Pork ribs tough and the pork meat was minced. Beans canned. Slaw had too much relish. Nealbwas saved by hush puppies.
4	Very good BBQ. Ask for bark pieces and consider yourself fortunate if you get them. The Brunswick stew is the best I've had.
3	I thought it was about a 3-star joint. It's just a different style of bbq that I'm not used to.
2	Service was good . I was expecting authentic eastern  NC barbeque. The meat had a decent smoke flavor, But the tomato sauce that was thrown on it ( Where they do that at) smdh. The brisket was a bit tough. The ribs where tough on the ends , tender in the middle. Get a new barbecue sauce. The sauce is ..... Not doing it. The Price is reasonable , a good place for cheap eats. Brunswick stew was good.
2	Tried all 4 meats. Ribs were as chewy as tire rubber; could only eat about 40% of the meat. The rest was just OK; they smother everything in their very soupy, tomato-vinegar based BBQ sauce, which tastes more tomato than barbeque. Chicken was OK, nothing special - I could taste the smoke a little, but mostly just sauce. The pork and beef are diced very fine and I could scarcely tell the difference between them. The restaurant itself is old and looks like it has never been updated since the 50s. With no windows, it's dark, dingy, and also a bit on the dirty-looking side. Especially the bathroom - wash your hands BEFORE  you go. I would look for a better BBQ, Charlotte.
3	Old Hickory House has everything you look for in a great barbeque place, except good barbeque.  Now wait a minute, maybe I'm being a bit too harsh here.  Old Hickory House has been around for a long time now, since the 50's from what I understand.  And from the way the place looks, everything is still original, the recipes, the furniture, the tablecloth's, and the waitresses.    It's five thirty on a Thursday and we drive up to this cinderblock old building, the parking lot was empty except for one pick up truck.  It had my buddies and I thinking "wtf are we walking into?".  Tired looking waitress with dirty ankles seats us promptly.  We order drinks and a variety of foods.  I ordered the beef brisket sandwich with beans and slaw.  My two buddies order combination plates.  My sandwich was all right but I was looking around for some sauce.  None was offered.  Beans were good as well as slaw.  My buddies ordered the combo plate which was pulled beef and pulled pork.  The cook mixed the pork and beef together....yea thats a combo all right.  Couldn't stop laughing about that.  Service was quick, prices weren't too bad.  Much less expensive than Memphis BBQ.  Decor was something else, kind of a dingy old west look.  Not dirty but not clean.  This is worth one visit to decide for yourself if this is for you.
2	I have to agree with Jeffrey C here. Great service, old-school barbecue atmosphere, but really really lousy barbecue. Low and slow is the way to go boys. Chicken tasted like petrified wood. barbecue is only as good as the cuts of meat start with. Their cuts seem to be on the cheap and tough side. Even ribs that should've fallen off the bone were tough and harsh. Barbecue sauce way too heavy and vinegar and not enough heat. Presentation is a big cafeteria zero. The Brunswick stew was chopped up mishmash that looked really disgusting although it tasted reasonably decent. Hush puppies were the only thing that lived up to advertising. Local yelpers let me down here, or y'all just haven't had much good barbecue. Tickets one star for service and one star for atmosphere. If they could find someone who can cook in that great smoker, then it might be a really cool hip place.
5	As a Texan in NC I came here to try some of their BBQ. I ordered their Pork Sandwich with slaw and it was pretty good. No complaints there. Their coleslaw was a little too sweet for my taste but still very good. Also definitely try their Brunswick Stew and hush puppies! The service was also prompt and they were friendly. The only complaint my party had was that they wish there was more meat for the price. Other than that, we would come back again if in Charlotte.
2	Ate their brisket last night.  It wasn't good at all.  Restaurant was pretty dead.  I'm surprised the rating is so high.
4	Came from Vegas, and really enjoyed the BBQ! The tomato vinegar based sauce was something different, but me and my son loved it! Hush puppies were awesome, and rubs were nice and meaty! I love supporting businesses like this, and appreciate the non-corporate uniqueness about this place. Sweet tea was great too!
5	No other bbq comes close. This place has been a family tradition for forever and I've never had anything better. I always get the large bbq pork plate with coleslaw and hushpuppies or beans, and a bowl of brunswick stew (to share with my sister). Everything is simply perfection - especially the buttery toast  that comes free with your meal! I love how nothing has changed from food down to the decor - I hope it never does!
5	Over 2 years later and their Brunswick Stew is still the best I've ever had. Their brisket is better than I remembered and I had the exact meal as before-but without the ribs. Finally I grabbed a slice of Pecan Pie ala mode-not homemade but very good!All in all I'd add another star if I could for the consistency!
2	Prob was good back in the day.  Inside looks it did 20 years ago if I had to guess.  Food was okay, mostly reheated.  It tasted good but did not want make me want to come back.  Sweet tea was spot on.  Waitress was friendly.  They do not clear your table of any plates until you leave so don't plan on staying and visiting at your table.
4	Amazingly-friendly service, classic American BBQ and priced to kill. No doubt a standard go-to for good BBQ in the area.
4	What appears to be a classic barbecue joint that might have been here for decades, Old Hickory House is feeling its age. But hey, so what? The second clue that it was going to be good was when we noticed that there was no extra sauce on the table. "These folks mean it," I said to my dining companion.We ordered a couple of barbecue platters it is was more than decent. Finely chopped pork and beef topped with a sauce that was both tomato based and still had a good vinegar kick. I had mine with beans and Brunswick stew. A basket with four slices of excellent Texas toast was also delivered.A very different Brunswick stew from one I've ever had before. While it's probably an old family recipe, it was mush (like an oatmeal texture) and had quite a lot of corn in it. Strange?
4	Good grilled cheese for the kids and hush puppies. Good pork sandwich but not so crazy about the bbq sauce! :-)
1	We've had this venerable (began operation in 1956)BBQ Joint on our NC Barbecue Bucket List for more than a few years now.  Last Tuesday we paid them a visit, and it was much less than we'd hoped for, much less in almost every respect. There is little here that represents the more traditional NC barbecue restaurant, which doesn't mean it has to be bad, but here it did mean that..The building is beyond well worn, the parking area seems a work-in-progress, hard to tell where the roadside ends and the parking begins. The inside is dark (almost brooding), and not a great deal of light spreads out from the small, faux oil lamp fixtures.We were seated promptly in the almost empty dining area, drink orders secured, and our food choices followed quickly. We went with 1/4 BBQ Chicken (dark meat) with Brunswick Stew and Baked Beans ($8.19), and a Small BBQ Pork plate with FFs & Slaw (also $8.19). The meals did not come with HPs but rather with thick slices of Texas Toast - the first of a number of things not traditional in NC BBQ restaurants. You can buy an order of HPs for $1.79 if you'd like, we didn't.The food was out of the kitchen rather quickly, and that was perhaps the highlight of the ensuing meal. The BBQ Chicken was simply awful - it was overcooked, dry & tasteless sans the sauce, the skin tough and leathery - the whole mess smothered in a thick sweet, red barbecue sauce that quickly became cloying. The Brunswick Stew was pretty good though very different in texture and content from that normally served in this area. The stew here is thicker and contains no lima beans, and according to UNC TV food guru Bob Garner, it probably contains stale bread, which thickens the end product. The Baked Beans also were nice, with some pieces of meat in it.The pork is minced, much like Stamey's in Greensboro, but the pork here is not cooked over hard wood coals, so there is no smokiness to it, at all. The sauce is a thick red sauce, rarely found in this area, usually found farther west. I like  this style sauce on occasion, but not this sauce, and not on this meat.The service was very good, until it came time to pay the check. We waited over 5 minutes at the register while several employees milled around, apparently not authorized to operate the register. Finally, an unpleasant and rude man (the owner or manager, I guess) came out of the back, took my money without a "I'm sorry", or a thank you. Well, I've a thought on the thanks part - no thanks for this food, this restaurant, and this arse at the register.
4	This restaurant is a Charlotte Must Try.  It is like a time capsule with the decor and open pit smoker in plain view.   Traditional southern BBQ with all the sides.The servers were friendly and the BBQ was great.
5	Love this place.  Did take out for the first time here yesterday.  Food was great and hot.  Going back today to try the brunswick stew everyone keeps talking about.  Havent had bbq this good anywhere else in charlotte.  I had the pulled pork, teriyake and canjun wings.  The teriyake wings were alittle too sweet but the cajun wings were perfect.  I recommend you try this place.  Prices are alittle high, but what do you expect, ITS BBQ!
2	Not what I expected.  The brisket (hash) was flavor-less, without the sauce; like wise was the ribs.  The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, but tasted like it was cooked without even the most basic salt and pepper seasoning. It also had not a single hint of smoke flavor to it. The sauce, although different, was very good and salvaged the entire meal.The decor is like stepping into a diner from the late 80's. But it works and I kinda like the feel of this place. The visible opened-faced smoker is a great touch and adds to the overall laid back atmosphere.
