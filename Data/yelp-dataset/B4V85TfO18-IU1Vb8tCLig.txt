4	I came here with a lovely friend who was showing me his beautiful city of Montreal (I am from Boston). I had a sip of the orange juice, which was fresh squeezed and it was truly some of the best OJ I have ever tasted. If you like pulpy juice, which I do, then you might really enjoy this. Puis nous sommes partage une omelette  d'eggspectations (filled with bacon, sausage and veggies) and I can say it really exceeded my eggspectations! Les pommes de terres etaient amazing, Je les ai mange sans ketchup which is a big deal as I am addicted to ketchup!And as always, if you have broken francais comme moi, c'est ok, toutes les personnes parlent les deux, francais et anglais! Je t'adore Montreal et Eggspectations!
