2	Who came first Rudsak or M0851 (formerly Rugby North America)? The store is nice and well laid out, staff friendly and prices reasonable, however Rudsak still seems like a cheaper imitation version of M0851. The leather is of a poorer quality (calfskin on the surface that flakes off with age) and their latest seasonal line comes with their company name plastered over some of the goods. If you want a new bag, wallet or coat and want to invest and own a classic item that will age, visit M0851 on St. Laurent instead.
3	I was going to give this place a 4 or 5 until I read conrads review!Everything looked beautiful and great quality but I guess beware...Everything was super-cheap/on sale this week, go bad economy!
2	I wish I had read Conrad's comment earlier. The clothes here are stylish, but it is true that everything in the store is made in China. I also found out the hard way that the Rudsak policy is no return and no refund if you buy an item with any promotion. Only exchange. Rudsak has promotions going on all the time, so please be very sure of your purchase. I can't recommend this store.
1	customer service at this company is ZERO. They just don't care.Online system, zero as well. They always put something online that is not available at the store nor online and you have to run around calling stores and the warehouse to find out at the end that it is not in stock.Also they don't respond to any of the emails that you send and when trying to call the head office you always get the voice mail.Unprofessional, unacceptable and RIDICULOUS!
