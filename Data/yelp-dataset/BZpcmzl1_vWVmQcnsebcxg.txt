4	Brought my family here for a brief spring break trip to Charlotte.Very pleased with the property. Pleasant staff, comfortable rooms. Excellent fresh breakfast choices.My only quibble is the showers. During our stay the property was having trouble providing hot water. The General Manager, Juan, made a point of checking in with me after I first alerted them to the problem as I saw him doing with other guests. Their exercise room is small but has a few cardio machines and a full set of dumbells. They also signpost a trail for running outside. Overall, it's a clean well situated and run property. I would stay here again.
5	Beautiful, clean, and well run. Comfortable rooms, good food, decent coffee. Large and comfortable showers. Comfortable and clean beds with a pullout couc for our daughter in the outer room. Pet friendly, which was such a relief as we're traveling with our dog. Great pale and we will definitely look for other Home2 locations when we travel!
5	LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! Yes this is a premiere spot. We had a king size suite with all the apt amenities. The room was so spacious and the bathroom was cute. As for breakfast? Let me tell you!!! Bomb! I had waffles with strawberries, butter, and syrup. SO GOOD! Okay, so this isn't the Ritz but for a regular hotel, you'd wish you could get away and stay in diggs like this. Here's a tip: bring a couple empty travel bottles to filler up with the shampoo and body wash they have in the shower.
