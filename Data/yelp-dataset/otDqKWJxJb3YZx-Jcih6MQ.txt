3	Your local Terrible Herbst.  It was clean and well maintained.  It had all that you would expect from a convienence store, it was convienent (hopefully I spelled convienent correctly, haha).
4	Always friendly service, but parking can be a zoo, and getting to a gas pump is like playing a slow speed game of chicken more often than not. The store like all Terribles locations sorely needs an update and a deep cleaning (or a bulldozer to wipe it out and start over). For all it's flaws I still stop in here a lot so I can't complain too much. 4 Stars...because service with a smile covers a multitude of sins. (This review is for the gas station side, I've never stepped foot into the McDonalds it shares space with.)
1	I like terrible herbst. But this specific location sucks and had a bad experience  here with one of the employees. I went to pump gas and went inside to pay I handed the clerk 40 dollars and told him the pump number while pumping my gas the pump stopped at 35.00 and didn't pump any more and I knew it wasn't because of a full tank cause 40 dollars gives me about a half a tank on my SUV so in went inside to get the change only to be told by the same clerk that I only gave him 35 dollars now that got me boiling and demanded to have my change and told him to review his surveillance tape and he will see the two $20 bills I handed him but since I didn't feel like going to jail I just let it go...so F this place and double F to that clerk I hope those five dollars got you feeling like you are on top of the world.
