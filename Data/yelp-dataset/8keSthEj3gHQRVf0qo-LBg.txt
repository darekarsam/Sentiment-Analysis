4	My new go-to dry cleaners. I haven't gotten anything fixed or hemmed here, but in terms of just getting your suits or pants cleaned, it's perfect. Friendly staff and quick turn around. Reasonable prices. Speaks English.
5	I love this place! Their prices are affordable, $3 per item!! and I have never had a problem with any of my clothes being ruined.  I have gone to dry cleaners that charge $8-12 per item and then shrink my clothes.  Ridiculous!! When I first heard of this place, I thought it was too good to be true, but it's not.  The only thing that I was skeptical about was that you have to pay in advance before they clean your clothes, but trust me, this place is good and your clothes will come back clean and with no damage.
4	This is a great little gem of a dry cleaners! They've got great prices and have never had any kind of an issue. All items have always come back perfect! On their alterations? Outstanding! I went in recently with a  complex request, "party shirts" for my entire wedding party. Providing donor shirts, fabric and minimal instruction they came out great! The only downfall for the alterations side is that they don't have a changing room. Makes it a little tough if you want pants hemmed, or dresses for the ladies. I'll also post a couple pictures of the shirts they made for me!
5	It's New Years eve, I have a brand new suit that NEEDS to be tailored. First place I called was Careful Cleaners (mostly because they are down the street from my place of employment), I explained my situation to the very nice tailor that answered the phone, she advised me to come on in. I originally went in just for the pants to be altered, and she recommended a few alterations to my jacket as well. She was incredibly nice and told me I could pick it up after 1PM (I came in at 10:30AM!!). I am blown away by the customer service I received here. This is my new home for all my dry cleaning and tailoring needs.
