1	One of the worst places on earth they lied and cheated me. I called and talked to a person named Tim and he told me he would price match the tires from discount and take 10% off. I went in the next day and tim said they don't price match anymore. I asked to speak to the manager and they said he was gone it was only 330pm. Then Tim left me saying he had to leave. So I had to wait for the other person to finish. The other person was Erik he seem to care about the problem. He was very sorry that Tim said that we would price match and he would price match because Tim lied to me. While I was waiting to get the tires put on Erik was waiting on at any given time 3 or more people and never lost his cool. It seem to me he had to take care of a whole shop. Erik was the only reason I will ever go back.
2	I went here a couple months ago and got what I expected thats why it gets at least 2 stars. I went  today though to get some tires repaired and i waited for 40 mins with out anyone acknowledging I was there. The man checking people in for sure saw me but didn't even wave nod or say anything to confirm I was waiting. He then walked off and showed back up only to talk to other employees in the garage. I left and went to firestone tires up the street and got helped right away
4	I have not used their services for a considerable period because of having a superb garage that is much closer. I write a review to balance out the other reviews. I had a lot of service done here. Service at counter and on vehicles was always four stars.Product was three to five stars. Price was average to high. Every person, and there were a lot, were always courteous and professional. I was never ignored nor did I ever see someone else ignored. They never gave me cause to find fault.
