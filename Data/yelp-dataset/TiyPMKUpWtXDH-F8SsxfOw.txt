4	This is an outdoor store for men / women.  From fly-fishing to outdoor clothing, this is for the active outdoor living family.  It is high end, high quality items, with a great knowledgeable staff.Located right in the middle of Phillips Place (across from Brooks Brothers) this location is easy to get in and out of.  If you need clothing and shoes for that long hike or cold winter, these guys will be able to assist with a wide variety of quality manufacturers.I am happy to have found this place locally, as they have a wonderful online store as well, that I have been using for years.Think Bass Pro Shop or Cabela's, then add ALOT of class.  These guys are wonderful.Definitely for the distinguished shoppers.Thanks for the great service......NCFoodGuy
1	LOVE Orvis clothing! HATE the indifferent, non-service, that I experienced.
5	I'm a student at Appalachian state and I am home for the thanksgiving holiday, I went here because I was given a gift card and a needed some new flys and accessories for fly fishing, as soon as I walked in the best service and attention was given to me, they laid out everything I needed and made sure I did not over spend, I commend there service and will always be a repeat customer because of my EXCELLENT experience. If you need anything fly fishing related or just anything I would recommend going here!!!!!
