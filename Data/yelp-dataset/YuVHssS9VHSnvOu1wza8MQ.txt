5	This is one the finest Chinese restaurants in town...excellent customer service and excellent food. They have a buffet menu from which one can choose as much as one wants and taste every possible dish in the menu. The food is brought in small portions, but its basically a all-you-can-eat type of thing, without getting up from the table. Near Metro Namur. Good choice to bring friends and family and enjoy hearty Chinese food...it hits the spot.
2	Am I the only one who thinks these hot and spicy restaurants are seriously overrated?I have always been from the school of thought that nothing good ever comes in an all you can eat format. I don't care if it's a Chinese buffet, Vichy, La Stanza, or the Pizza Hut lunch buffet! The food is just okay. But the wine is 3 - 3.5 times the SAQ prices! Seriously!!! Who wants to pay $43 for a $13 bottle? It's flat-out insulting.
