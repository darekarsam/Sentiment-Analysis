3	A new place by Wal Mart that just opened up, very clean and polite service. However despite being a new place their soda machine was broken, or perhaps they just haven't gotten it operational yet? Either way it's a rip off for the canned sodas they make you buy instead. Also the meat served here is mostly just fat tissue, not really any actually meat.Pretty good pricing and overall a nice junk food run if you're in a hurry.
3	good customer service. food was okay. their 'fried saimin' was tasty, however, instead of saimin noodles, they used a thin chow mein type noodles. i hope they research more into hawaiian food because some of the desciptions in the menu of classic island food were wrong.
3	I had lunch here with some co-workers as it is close to our employer. I ordered the #1 combination plate which comes with fried shrimp, mahi mahi and your choice of one item.I like that they allow you to substitute items, so instead of the mahi mahi I decided on bbq short ribs and chicken katsu.Their plates come with two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad. I really enjoyed the chicken katsu and fried shrimp. The rice is really good and I am not normally a fan of white rice however when you mix the macaroni salad and the katsu sauce in, it was tasty!The bbq short ribs left a lot to be desired as one was completely inedible as it was all tough grizzle, the other one was good.The meal is generous and for 8.95 you can't go wrong. I think we will do lunch here again, I will just refrain from the bbq short ribs and try a different choice.The macaroni salad is not so good stand alone, however mixed in with everything else it is ok.It was not the best however not the worst. I am down to try it again.
