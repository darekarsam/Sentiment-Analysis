5	If your looking for a stylist that you can ALWAYS depend on, you have found her with Kuuipo at Colors N Cuts Studio.   In addition to the wonderful cuts and styles, she has done it all with me.  Frosting, colors, Brazilian Blow-outs and recently extensions, that I am loving!    She is professional, and often has gone out of her way to accommodate my schedule.  Also, I love that Kuuipo is a student of her profession.  She is always going to classes, and learning about new products, and the latest in her industry.  This lady is as good as they get.
5	I have been going to Colors N Cuts Studio for over three years.  I can count on Kuuipo to be on time, to get me in and out while I feel connected to and cared for by her, and she ALWAYS does an amazing job.  Her prices are fair and reasonable especially with the high level of quality.  I do a lot of work in the public and I need to KNOW my hair color and cut show me in my best light.  Kuuipo's work is something I count on and I am NEVER disappointed!  I HIGHLY recommend you give her a try.
5	I had been going to the same stylist for 10 years and when she moved away I was in a panic! Lets face it when you trust your stylist you don't want to change. However, I have a good friend who always has beautiful hair and I mentioned to her I needed to find a new stylist and she told me about Kuuipo. I have been going to her for the last 3 years and I have never been happier with my color and my cuts. I also have a very crazy schedule and Kuuipo has been so incredible to accommodate my hectic schedule. Thank you Kuuipo for always making me look and feel amazing!
