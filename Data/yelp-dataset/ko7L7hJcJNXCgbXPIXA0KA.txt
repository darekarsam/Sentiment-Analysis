4	I met David Frers of The Living Room through a mutual contact.  We were looking to get some things framed and matted for the place where I work.David was able to provide us with different options and price ranges to accomodate our budget.  We were able to get the job done in a short amount of time with the least amount of hassle and the framed pieces look great!We will definitely use him the next time a project like this comes up and I personally will take my things to him to be matted and framed.
5	David is amazing to work with. Very passionate about what he does. Always helpful and LOVES emergency framing projects. What a great experience!!!
5	I agree David is amazing to work with.  What a brilliant eye for framing.  The Living Room is definitely my go to place for framing now.  In the beginning I may have been reluctant to turn pieces over to be framed with little input, but David has proven that he knows what's best for the artwork and knows what he's doing.
