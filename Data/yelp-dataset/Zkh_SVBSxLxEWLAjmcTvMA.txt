2	The cashier told my husband that should he get change and the air machine just don't work don't come back in asking for a refund. This location the employees are uneducated on any kind of hospitality when having contact with human customers. I just don't care for employees who have a rude attitude. How do store owners proudly have a rude person as a cashier?  Well let's see how that will work out for them. ATTENTION all friends the people are rude at this location.
3	Need my truck wash and I was padding by rebel so I decided to stop. Was busy and I got in pretty quick. Got a full service wash which included tires and protective coat. After waiting nearly 25 minutes my truck was finally ready, only to find out that it wasn't fully done. Water still on back window and when I opened the door drips of water came down. Dirt smudges still on tail gate. After I pointed everything out they took care of it and finished it the right way. Just took about another 10 minutes. Wasn't terrible, but wasn't great either. At least the customer service was good...-Joe
