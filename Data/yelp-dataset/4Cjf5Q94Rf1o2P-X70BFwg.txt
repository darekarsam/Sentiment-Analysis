4	Get the one dollar bbq pork bun. Have them heat it up for you.
3	Apparently this restaurant has learned their lesson regarding the importance of proper sanitation in food preparation and storage - a big ATTABOY and plus two stars. Gordon Ramsay would be proud of their constant improvement. It is a little amazing though that it took them FOUR years to get their act together. Frankly, I'm amazed that the health dept. let them remain open when their score hit 74.0. If they ever reach grade A, I will drop by to get some Chinese BBQ.

Just ignore the pig hanging from the ceiling if you find that gross and also ignore the food rating as I survived my visit and I am sure you will yours.  Just make sure to wipe down your silverware when you get them.Personally I really liked the BBQ pork which you can see hanging with all the meat in little strips; which, they cut up and serve with rice is really good.
5	It's inside the mall and the food is awesome! Probably the best authentic Chinese dinner you can have on Christmas Eve in North Carolina. Just don't peek in the kitchen. You're all good.
4	Pretty run of the mill mom & pop shop, roast pork & bbq pork is sold at $9 a lb. and what can I say the bbq is pretty on par with what I can get in Boston both crispy and flavorful respectfully. Great to know I can find some comfort food in Charlotte.
