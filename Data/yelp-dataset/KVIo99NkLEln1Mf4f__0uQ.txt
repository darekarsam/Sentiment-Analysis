1	I waited 2 hours and nobody showed up with my food! Absolutely ridiculous all I ordered was a burger and fries
3	I ordered a pasta dinner and Stromboli through Eat 24. The site showed an estimated 45-60 mins for delivery, and they arrived almost exactly at the 1 hour mark. The pasta noodles were over cooked, but the sauce's flavor was OK. My boyfriends Stromboli was "alright" and unexpectedly large. The garlic knots were very, very good. I added a little of my own garlic, but I would buy them again here. I've had much worse. I will probably try Smashlee's again at some point.
