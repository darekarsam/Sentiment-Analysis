5	THE best cheesesteaks, freshest buns, there is nothing bad here!!
5	Recently realized that I have been a customer of Rudy's for 40 years. When I was a kid we got Sicilian-style pizza from his previous location on Washington St. in Swissvale. Then when they moved and became a sub shop I got hooked on those wonderful cheesesteaks. Now I live over 15 miles away and still head over there from time to time for my cheesesteak fix.Now to be clear, this is probably not a place your typical Yelper would like. There is no ambiance. No "decor". No table service. No boutique brands of soda. Nothing on the menu is "infused". You'll probably want to get your sandwich to go.But if you want a delicious cheesesteak, I don't know why you would want to go anywhere else. The two best hoagie places in the area are less than a half-mile apart on the same street  - Rudy's and the Triangle bar.

I live 1100 miles away, but my first (and third, and fourth and fifth) stop when I go to Pittsburgh is always Rudy's. I usually avoid meat, cheese, and white carbs, but this definitely merits an exception. I have tried everything and like most all of it, but always get the steak and cheese, with egg. We never even heard of that back home. Get the smaller one unless you're sharing. I have to take part of the small to go, its enormous.I think they've been in the same place for 30 years and never heard about paint. Who cares what it looks like though, when its the best thing you ever put in your mouth?
