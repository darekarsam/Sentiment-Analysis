3	Standard Panda Express food.Did find what appears to be a small bone chip in one of my chicken entrees tonight.
2	The item I wanted when I went thru the drive thru wasn't available, the black pepper chicken, which was fine, it happens sometimes. So I picked 2 other items that were, the sweetfire chicken and the honey walnut shrimp. after paying for my items, the lady at the window asked if I wanted some soy sauce, I said yes and then asked her for some rice wine vinegar. She then said, what is that? now I don't know if y'all sell that at all, but I enjoy a sauce similar to that at my local Chinese delivery place. I don't know your menu selections because frankly I have only been to a panda express once or twice before... Now back to the order of food when I got home.... Well, both of the items I selected were very soggy with cooking oil, every bite I took just flooded my mouth with an oil taste not the flavor of the sauces I was expecting. The chicken had pieces that were nothing but breading and very hard. The chow mien noodles were even really oily and not cooked properly, they were hard to chew, rubbery. It was overall very disappointing to me. I don't think I will return to this store anytime soon.. I'll stick to my favorite delivery place, they are cheaper in price, and the quality and quantity of food is great.
4	Eh. It's Chinese fast food. Satisfied the late night craving. They were nice at drive thru.
1	Went to the drive thru and waited for 20 mins!!! This is the worst panda I've ever been to!! Customer service is bad! I don't recommend on going to the drive thru unless you have extra 20 mins to spare! Not coming back here!!!!
1	Store employee Anna was very rude, she expressed a bad attitude when I asked for a little bit more shrimp. We asked for a sauce, she told me to hold on while she finished counting the pieces of meat. Go to another Panda Express. Poor Customer Service.
