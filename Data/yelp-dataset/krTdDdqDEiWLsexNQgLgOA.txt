4	I used this company for the purchase and installation of the gravel in my backyard.  Pricing for the materials and labor was the best I could find and I checked numerous places.  Everything went well and I am happy with the service I received.  Clean-up was good as well. There were a few areas that were uneven and there was some damage to a few of my plants,  so I can't give them a 5 star rating.  But overall I'm happy,  so I will be using them again for any household projects that I cant take care of myself.
5	I used fix 'em up for a complete landscape of my backyard. The options were extensive, the prices were fair and very competitive, and the service was honest. We were given plans to choose from, everything was customizable... When everything was finished and set up, we were satisfied.
