5	The 99 Cent Store on 43rd Ave & Bell is as good as it gets !They have just about anything you want or need imanginable and its only 99 cents.  They even have milk by the gallon but that is $2.59.  You can get all your staples here and supplement your grocery shopping.  The store is clean and cashiers are friendly this is definetly the best 99 Cent Store in Phoenix.
4	This 99 cent only store is a lot better than most of the others I have been to. This store is very clean and organized. I knocked a star off because the cashier was not very friendly. Overall, an above average 99 cent only store.
5	Everything is really 99 cents!!! And they seem to have everything even brand names, I'm impressed! Nice store!
5	Huge 99 cent store the biggest I have found. Everything is here!!
