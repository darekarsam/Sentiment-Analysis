1	It was easy to get an appointment. However, the first time we used them we were still seeing black pincher bugs. The following month we tried them again and we are now seeing spiders! The pest control worked for the cockroaches, but we never had an issue with seeing either of the black pincher bugs or spiders until we used js pest control. Since I used a groupon they will not come out and respray. Thus, don't waste your time or money unless you want to start seeing some new bugs in your house!
5	Brian came out the very next day, on time, called before arriving, and walked us through the initial Pretreatment.He offered us understanding and insight into what was important to consider and what not to be concerned about. He kindly took away traps that Orkin just left and didn't want to return for. There was no pressure - we can contact him back over the next month or two should we decide to continue on a scheduled treatment. Will update this report should we see any issues over the next month.
