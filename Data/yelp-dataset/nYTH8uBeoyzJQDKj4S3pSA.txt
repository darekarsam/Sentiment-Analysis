5	I LOVE this store, hands down the best prices on tattoo and piercing supplies, I always get my orders really fast. I know their shipping says 5-7 days, but I think the longest it has taken in the 9 times I have ordered from them is 3 days. I have never needed to contact customer service. My orders ship out the same day usually (unless it's really late in the day), so far all the ones I have received are correct and good quality. The only not so great things are that I wish they had a bigger selection so I could order everything from them instead of only ordering some of the items I need. Shipping is also a little pricey and there is only one shipping option.Overall though this is a great online store and is the only one I order needles from!
5	I have been going to the Needle Supply for years to get supplies for my studio. They really care about the industry and the artists in it. They have good products at reasonable prices and I never have any issues with them. All in all a very good place and I will continue to order my supplies from there!
5	Great prices and products. I love that they are constantly getting in new and different supplies too.
