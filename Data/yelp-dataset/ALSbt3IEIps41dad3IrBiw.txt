1	I called yellow cab (also a 1 star wonder), and this Elite cab showed up.  I tried to ask if they were related, but I'm not sure the hispanic driver could understand me.  I got in anyway and headed to the airport.  I still don't know if they are related.  I had to direct the driver where to go.  When we arrived, he did not stop the meter until I mentioned it.  I then tried to pay with my corporate business credit card (like any business traveller).  He then tried to get me to pay cash.  We went back and forth and it says right on the widow, "accepts credit cards".  He finally relented and started the process, I got on the phone with the dispatcher and read the number to him.  The driver then proceeded to take an imprint of the card.  He was spending a lot of time to get the imprint right and I mentioned that I need to get going.  Finally he passes me the "chit" to sign.  I don't like the hassle or the customer service.  The dollar amount was blank, so I filled in what was on the meter and signed it.  He then said it was $3 more for a credit card charge.  I took my copy and threw the other paper at him, closed the door, and caught my flight.  Do not use this cab company.  Terrible customer service and deception.  Made to feel bad for trying to use a credit card.
5	They were prompt and very friendly. SUPER CHEAP as well. I'm a young college student and to avoid running late for work and classes, these guys are on my speed dial.
4	Excellent service, fast and affordable.
1	Horrible, had to wait almost an hour for a cab to pick me up. Should have just called somewhere else in the meanwhile.
