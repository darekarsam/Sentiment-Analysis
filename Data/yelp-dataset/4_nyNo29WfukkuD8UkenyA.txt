5	PSA is perfection. Anyone who knows me will tell you that I'm very protective of my hair, and hunted high and low across the city for over a year before finding, and falling in love with, Paterson SA in Leith.Ashley, my stylist at PSA, has the rare ability of really listening to her clients, remembering their past cuts, taking into account their needs and habits whilst also having the creative flair to know what will make a cut flattering, personality fitting and lasting. She always wants to know how you've been finding your hair since the last cut, and develops the style well according to your comments. I can safely say that their the only hairdressers I've had in a long time that I've completely trusted. Their free hair drying tutorial session is also a wonderful chance to learn some tips that you can actually use at home, and if you're saving they also have regular model days to train a fantastic set of up and coming stylists. The actual salon is lovely, with local artists providing a constantly changing set of pieces for their walls. And the head massages... Oh the head massages... I would have one every day if I could!Hope you have a happy haircut!
