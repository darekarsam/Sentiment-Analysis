4	This is a very conveniently located Chipotle for me. They are just down the street from my home and the staff are always very friendly.It's also quite amazing how quickly they fill my order. I can be in and out with an order of four Burritos inside three minutes. The results are always tasty.
2	Cheap on RICE. That is just the start. You'd be hard pressed to find unfriendly chipotle staff. These people are among the friendliest I have encountered. But, they are cheap on the rice, let alone the meat. How else do you improve same store profitability? I've had better. Recently their guacamole is pretty good.
5	Chipotle is the greatest food on earth.
5	Is it true that a chicken bowl only has 550 calories?
5	Who doesn't love Chipotle?!?!The quality of food is always good and hot! i love their burrito bowls, they fill me up and fill me up again during a second meal! I love food that has longevity. They may skimp out on rice, or whatever ingredient you love, but all you have to do is ask for extra and they will giveth, without charging!! (except for meat) The service is always fast and friendly. I love going here when I'm in the mood for something cheap, quick and yummy!
2	First of all, let me say I love Chipotle. But this particular location has not been up to par. First of all the tortilla is always over done and hard. Secondly, they fill it so much, that at the end, they can't fold it to make the ends meet. I know that's a weird complaint; a burrito that's too big?? But it makes a complete mess. It's just less enjoyable. Mine isn't always so bad, but my husband's burrito is always out of control. Funny thing is he gets a vegetarian burrito with no meat! I think they feel sorry for this meatless burrito so they load it with all the other stuff!! Other than that I have no complaints...it's always fresh. It's still tastes good and the service is OK. Nothing to rave about.
4	i don't know if i would have to do a review for chiptole because everyone already knows how delicious chipotle is.  i think this particular location is pretty good though.  they are normally generous with the portions and the food is always fresh.  i will forever try to avoid the location by the lv outlet mall on lv blvd - we both found hairs in our food last time we went and they somehow got our burrito bowls soupy.anyways, yeah - compared to some of the other locations we've tried in vegas, this one is pretty solid!
4	I love love love Chipotle! Fast food but it doesn't feel like 'fast food' if you know what I mean. Quite addicting.
4	What can I say, if you have been to 1 Chipotle you have been to them all.  One downside I have noticed here is that if you place a large group order online, they have a tendency to mess it up. But if you give them a call they have never put up a fight about making it right either then or next time you are in.
4	This place gets 4 stars for fast casual dining.  The great thing about Chipolte is the consistency amongst it's restaurants. Food is fresh, flavors are great and it is one of the most efficient restaurants in regards to putting out the food and moving the line along.
4	it felt like fresh mexican food was a first for me. you can pick and choose to make tacos, burrittos, salad, and rice bowl. the ingreidents seem super fresh and the portion was huge. I wasn't that big of a mexican food fan now i am!
3	If for some reason you are just crawling out from under your rock and have never had Chipotle, you should. I was first turned on to burritos made to order like this at a place called Edrito's Burritos back in Buffalo. Being that they have no Chipotle or to many other decent Mexican / Tex-Mex food in Buffalo, I was in heaven at Edrito's.Found Zaba's out here when i first moved to Las Vegas. Wasn't until after being out here for couple more years that I tried Chipotle who seemed to be the main known place for this burrito style. ( I tend to avoid franchises and chains)Onto my order today. Grabbed a steak burrito from here on lunch. All in all it was good but seemed to lack the flavor one from Zaba's does. Chipotle is a tad cheaper and has way more locations. This one today was busy but I was still in and out in less than 5 minutes.So to sum up, if you like made to order burritos, I prefer Zaba's but Chipotle is good place to get your fill.
5	OMG, I wish I could franchise this restaurant.  Their veggie bowl comes with big serving of Guacamole. I always skip the rice, low carb diet and this gives me a great meal.  I eat here too much, at least 3 times a week.  The servers are starting to remember my order I go here so much.
4	Still consistently good. Often in chains you will see a decline in quality over the years, but that's just not the case here. Recently added brown rice as an option, perhaps in response to competition from Zaba's? Definitely one of the best "fast food" options around.
3	I used to eat here very regularly, and I really like the Chipotle concept.I noticed the last few times when I ate at this location, it was very hit-or-miss with regards to presentation.  At times, the counter where the workers served the food just looked messy.  And sometimes the aprons would look messy.I used to work in fast food and know what its all about.  I don't see any excuse for this.  I probably pay more attention than most people to this issue, so take it with a grain of salt.That said - the vast majority of the people who work here are really good and friendly, and the food is very good, which is why I was a regular.Now I tend to eat here a lot less often, simply because I feel it is a crap shoot as to whether the presentation will be OK or not.
4	I have always loved Chipotle. I really like the way you can design the way your food is made (options). I have had been to all the Vegas locations and they are great. Check out the Steak Burrito bowl..... rock on.
4	Chipotle is the tits! If you haven't been... GO!Review over.
5	1st time and its delicious!!  Its also healthy and a good serving the rice is yummy.
5	This place is the best! I love their simplistic menu and calorie chart. Everything smells all fresh and tasty. Their tables are all configured like Subway with add-ons for the ultimate recipe. Definitely and A++
1	The worst food ever!!! White or brown rice? Are you kidding me? Has anyone ever had real Mexican food? Walk into don tortaco and ask for white rice and they will say.. Estas loca? A freakin joke. Worst food selection. The brown bag my food came in tastes better than my chicken taco. Seriously chipotle is a joke. If you want to eat healthy, don't eat out or go to whole foods.
4	I eat here once in a while with the mindset that when I do, I am eating the healthiest mexican food.  The low calorie count are even posted on the menu to prove their point that Chipotle is less fattening than what you normally get in other mexican restaurants.Expect a very american taste to the food served here.  The burritos don't taste like authentic mexican burritos but nonetheless it's still very good.  The chicken burrito is my favorite and it's up to you individually of what you want inside you burrito, something similar to the subway concept.  I like mine with black beans, brown rice, hot & medium salsa, lettuce, sour cream and guacamole.  You can also order it in a bowl instead of having it in a tortilla to lessen the calories.Overall if you've never tried this, you should! I know its a mix review here in yelp but for me personally I think the food here taste great.
4	I love coming here! Plenty of parking, kind/fast service, and awesome food. Everytime I come, I'm greeted with a smile, food is fast, fresh, and always on point. To top it off, arguably the healthiest option in terms of mexican food. Would deffinitely reccomend coming here.
4	In the back end of a huge plaza, it's neatly tucked away so it's hard to find but if you know where it its, it's easy access if you take the back roads. Big fan of chipotle and this location always have great service and portions.
5	Probably the best Chipotle I have ever been to food was made promptly and made exactly how I wanted it. Best Fast Food option in the area.
3	Chipotle is a good place if you want quick Mexican food.If you are looking for anything els, turn around and go some place els.
4	I normally don't eat burritos but I would for sure go back and eat at Chipotle. I had the burrito in a bowl and it was great. Everything tasted really fresh and very tasty. I had high expectations going in since my friends that I went with really talked this place up and Chipotle did not disappoint.
5	Always fast, friendly and fresh!!
4	Chipotle - fast, fresh and always good. Whenever I am having a craving for a burrito, burrito bowl, or tacos, this is definitely on the top of my list. This location is tucked away in the back of the shopping mall, but there is plenty of parking and during lunch (around 12noon) it will get packed. I've seen people walk in and then out because the line was too long, so be sure to come a little bit early if you are in a rush.The usual options are available for your choice - chicken, beef, barbacoa (shredded beef - a little spicy), pork. Now available is brown rice or white rice, and be sure to add the fajita mix (stir fried red onions and green peppers). They say there is a secret burrito menu, but still haven't found this. The only thing that I've tried is asking them to melt the cheese first (like a quesadilla) and then filling in the burrito - this way you get the melty cheese and the burrito wrap a bit more toasted.
1	usually a great place but I was hungry and the line was too long and the service was way too slow for a fast food place.
1	I wish I could give them 0 stars, but unfortunately, Yelp will not allow me to do so. I was starving after a long day of work and decided to go to Chipotle since it was on the way home. I asked for the steak bowl and when the lady scooped up a spoonful of meat, she decided to shake some back in their container and left me with only 5 cubes of meat! The spoon wasn't even 1/4 full. I'm a small person, but that's even TOO little for me. I had to ask her to add some more meat because that was too RIDICULOUS, and to make things WORSE, she charged me for extra meat. I was so hungry I couldn't even argue with her about how little she had given me the 1st time. I don't know what kind of business Chipotle is running but this isn't the first time this happened to me. It was, however, the most absurd and smallest portion I've ever received from them. So, i had to write a review. I cannot express in words how unhappy I was that day and how angry it made me, but all I can say is I'M NEVER GOING BACK!!!!!!! Even if it was the only place left on the planet that had food; with their portions, I would die starving anyway.
5	Borrowing from Homer Simpson...."Mmmmm. ahhhh, uhhhHHHhhrghhhuuuuHHHggrruhhhHHhh..."  This is what happens each time I go into Chipotle Mexican Grill.The their burrito bowl is like a magnet every time I am in the area....drawing me inside to purchase one.  It must be the fresh ingredients used along with the room full of happy customers also chomping down on their menu items that tells me the food here is great.I could write more, but challenge you to just "Experience It!"
4	If you haven't had Chipotle before, seriously - STOP reading this and go now.The first thing I must mention is that every time I come to this location -- -- the music is awesome. Whoever DJ Chipotle is, he\she is amazing and should do parties.I used to not like Chipotle. I think it was because my first few times I really didn't know what to order and I felt intimidated to just hurry up and stop holding up the line. But now I'm a pro!.Chipotle as a whole is just consistently a good meal. They make healthy Mexican food possible and... cool! They post the calories on the their board, their menu has no fads or frills, it's just great fresh food ready to be eaten.I always try to get the highest caloric meal I can for lunch.... also the most unhealthy. So I'm a barbacoa hard taco gal (yes they have hard shell tacos, just ask). I really enjoy their guacamole so I always get some to go with an order of chips.As most Chipotle's across town, this place gets busy busy busy at prime lunch time when I normally go. This location does get the line through quickly, so if you can spare a few minutes, it's worth the wait.
5	I LIKE IT. Fresh, healthy, quick food options without a hefty price tag. The line moves quickly and there's LOTS you can get. My favorite is a Chicken Burrito Bowl! Brown Rice option too! Woo woo.
4	Great food!   But stop being so stingy!!!!    I'm being charged $2 for extra guacamole then give me $2 worth!    I hate always having to ask for more..
3	At this place you always have to ask for extra stuff cause they are so cheap!
5	The Chipotle chicken salad is the largest food group in my nutritional pyramid. And I treat this Chipotle like my personal home kitchen! Except I really don't do any of the cooking. And it tastes delicious every time..The workers here are for the most part very friendly, generous, and efficient. Like all other locations it gets busy during peak dining hours but they do their best to keep the line moving. Until you get those n00bs in line that speak too quietly or don't know what they want which in that situation nothing can be helped. My personal recommendation is to order ALL THE SALSAS! Go for it. Don't be shy.
4	This particular location is in the deep part of Arroyo Market Square, but it is a really nice location to visit if you enjoy Chipotle. The restaurant itself is clean and I haven't had a problem with the staff. One of the things I like about this particular location is that they have outside dining that provides a calm, relaxing environment. If the weather permits and it's not too it or cold, take your meal outside and enjoy it!
1	**Summary**       - Cheap - I love Chipotle, but this location's service and portion size has been dwindling in months past. It's to the point, I'd rather drive an extra 10 minutes when I'm getting a craving for burritos.       - Strike #1 - Trying to charge me for double meat when I didn't ask for it and they only gave me the normal amount.       - Strike #2 - Being so cheap with their portion size as compared to other Chipotle's in town.       - Strike #3 - Treating their customers like criminals when they screw up and order or forget to give you what you ordered.**Visit 1**       - After getting the normal amount of steak I usually get from any other Chipotle, the cashier charges me for double meat.       - When I told him I didn't order double meat, he had to verify with his staff (since he didn't trust me) and then tell them they'd have to "talk" later.       - This shows me that they are actively trying to lower the amount of meat per portion.**Visit 2**       - Ordering a steak quesadilla, the amount of steak on there, couldn't even fit half the quesadilla.       - When they cut it into 4 pieces, there was a 1/4 of the quesadilla that had 2 tiny pieces of meat on it.       - I ordered a bowl and drinks as well that day. After I paid, I asked the cashier where my drinks were and she told me she gave it to the person I was with, who had walked to the drink area to get napkins.       - When I looked over and saw this wasn't the case, I told the cashier. The cashier has to walk around the corner and actually visually see she had not given the drinks to us before actually giving me the drinks.**Recommendations**       - I wouldn't really recommend this place. There are many other Chipotle's around town that don't try to cheat you at every turn.
4	I always order the same thing here. At all chipotles really. I love the consistency. As with most places like this, they have standards to adhere to and this location does a fine job of that. I always know what I'm getting here. This location seems to be popular by the amount of people I always see here.Contrary to some reviews about this locations, I don't feel that they "skimp" on the portion sizes. I don't get beans, sour cream, sauces, or "extra" anything and it's still overflowing. It's enough for me and I'm 6'1"... Although it IS pretty addictive so I always want more. Lol. My recommendation would be to go at non-peak hours because the line is significantly shorter.
2	Not the chipotle it used to be compared to couple years back..they are stingy with everything now..I barely come here anymore it used to be 2-3 times a week..step it up you are a big franchise now
1	Today was the first time I had ever gone into this location. The staff is nice but unfortunately, my image of this location is terribly tainted. I took my order to go. When I sat down to eat my veggie burrito bowl, I found a large dead moth in the lettuce. Discussing! Since I was super hungry and really didn't feel like diving back, I decided to just toss out the chunk of food surrounding the dead moth, and tried not to think about it as I tried to enjoy the food. As I took my second bite, I noticed a dead fruit fly in the lettuce. It was at this point that I couldn't take it anymore, so I drove back and got a refund. Never coming back to this location, ever! The manager handled the situation well, but these are just one of those things that a restaurant can't take back.
5	I love this place. Especially when I want a quick, healthy lunch. I always get 3 crunchy chicken tacos with guacamole on the side. I'm excited that next year Chipotle will be committed to using non-GMO ingredients for all their food!
5	I always order a kids meal: chicken quesadilla with two sides of brown rice. It comes with a kids drink of choco milk or apple juice and small bag of chips. How much total for this meal? $3.50 before tax! Best quick eat deal Cos it includes juice :)But that's regarding the whole chain. This location in particular I hold my appetite for because my food is so consistent here. Servers were always nice to me and when I tell them my sides, they always fill up the tray divider with rice. Today I even got more chicken and cheese than I'm used to. Overall: I've always had someone smile at this location.  Consistent and friendly. I wouldn't go to any other chain location.The worst Chipotle for me has to be Fashion Show...they looked miserable and my quesadilla was dry (very little cheese) and half full sides.
5	Started work today on the west side of town and the first thing I did was look for the nearest Chipotle. This location had a nice lunch crowd and the staff kept the line moving quickly. They had nice seating both indoors and out. As always the food was the bomb! I will be here on a regular basis!
2	Um, usually I do not have any challenges at any Chipotle, but I guess theres a first for everything...  I went there to pick up something for lunch on my way to work.  The people behind the counter were not on their A game that day.  I just got there in time, minutes before the lunch crowd came.  First gal was nice, second gal that did the salsa/condiments seemed like I was ruining her day by having her work, and finally the cashier gal was frazzled (and it wasn't busy yet).  I ended up getting charged double and it took about 8+ minutes for a manager to come refund me.  Now, given I really wasn't paying attention to the total when I gave her my card, but realized that the total was too much (it's what I pay when my husband and I go to lunch there, so I think that's why it didn't phase me at first).  Now enters the manager/supervisor of some type.  She was ok and not very communicative, by now the cashier was super frazzled and about 10 people had already came and went.  There were also about 10 people or so in line waiting.  Manager takes my card and proceeds to train the cashier on how to do a refund (still did not say a word to me)... DURING LUNCH RUSH... I would have done the refund really quick (if I was the manager) and told the cashier that I would show her AFTER the lunch rush.  Refund done and no apology or anything.  Then I started to walk away and the cashier hurriedly says "I apologize," half-heartedly.  Still nothing from the manager...
4	Here's burrito is my favorite~ I Can add everything i want and there also have guacamole as well~
3	It is February 6, 2014, I went to lunch here around 12:20 and every one seemed to be in a bad mood. Starting down the line, the black guy gave me a bad attitude when I ordered, the white guy was supper nice and awesome, and the big white girl wanted to charge me for a burrito for my quesadilla because I asked for pico De gallo and lettuce. Did not appreciate the bad experience :).
4	I love me some Chipotle about as much as I love my Starbucks. I go to them so often my girlfriend thinks I'm a connoisseur. Back to the review... So this Chipotle location is everything you'd expect. They have a nice clean dining area, a small outdoor patio, it's set back in the corner of a large shopping area so the patio is reasonably quiet and enjoyable. The price for what you get here is well worth the value. My favorite is the Burrito bowl. Basically all the contents of a burrito with all the calories in a giant flower tortilla. So you basically get the same great taste without the extra guilt. For a small up charge of less than $2 you can request double meat! It's handy for the times you get the girl who's trying to save the company a little money by shorting you. They have a pretty consistent system for portion control but there's inevitably employees who seem to act as though not quite a full spoon full is going to get them employee of the month or something. Anyway, Love the food, Great value for the price, comfortable quiet location, plenty of free parking!!
4	Always a go to spot if I'm craving a hearty burrito! I recently got into the quesorito which is now hands down my top 5 burritos of all time. You have your regular chipotle burrito but instead of your average tortilla, the wonderful ingredients are wrapped around a quesadilla which just kicks your taste buds up a notch. It may be filling for everyone else but just right for me. I do also recommend the taco kit, which is pretty much two tortillas, rice beans and choice of meat with a side bag of chips and a drink! You cannot go wrong there! It is one of my girlfriends favorite things to get.
4	I  go aleast twice a week. This place is good if you like american  mexican food. I like plan white rice or plan brown rice with out any wierd stuff in it. Its a secret menu item. If you ask they can give you these items.I usually get the steak burrtio with plan white rice, vegs,1/2 black beans, 1/2 pinto beans, cheese, and a coke zero. The only thing I dont like is the wierd music and it overall great food.
2	I'm a little bummed today chipotle.... The first thing I said in my old review was that I liked your consistency. Today's serving sizes were kids portions. And conveniently the guy behind me has an overflowing bowl. No I do not want "extra chicken". I want a proper amount. I want a FAIR amount. For $11.65, I expect a solid meal from chipotle. Not a child's meal. I'm unimpressed. I'm your second best guest according to yelp. Fix this crap.
4	I go here at least once a week.Amusingly, it's basically a Subway with Tex-Mex, but higher quality.  The meat is all organic which makes it actually pretty tasty.   They do a pretty good job at moving the line through too and never have an issue with custom orders (extra rice, extra corn, etc).Always get a similar item, and regardless of where you go, most Chipotle's are similar.   The corn might be a little hotter in some places versus others, but that's about it.Believe me.  You could eat here every day for weeks on end.   I have before.  And it's just.... so... yummy.
1	I will keep going to Roberto's! Chipotle is soo cheap with their meat! I ordered a burrito they put soo much rice and beans in it, and one scoop of meat inside. Then I asked is that all the meat she literally scooped 4 more peices of steak and kept on going. On top of that when I took a bite of steak it was really fatty and chewy. Never eating here again!
1	I've been to this chipotle about 15 times since my wife is obsessed. There are literally 100 other Mexican good places in this city but this is what she likes. Normally I deal with it because we're able to get in and get out. Tonight was probably the worst service I've ever received while coming to this place. Right before me a customer was told that he had to wait for chicken because they ran out. I guess he waited about 15 mins and they never called him to tell him it was ready so they sold it to other costumers. I waited in line patiently and then tried to order. The girl making the food made me repeat myself about 20 times...no exaggeration...because she was talking to people on the line. Then I tried to order and she laughed because they were out of soft taco tortillas. They only gave me two. Who I assume was the manager did nothing. As I tried to leave the door was locked..I asked if someone could let me out and they pointed to a side door and laughed at me like I was an idiot because they locked the door. I will never go back to this place..The way the manager treated the person in front of me and myself should warrant at the very least disciplinary action. Extreme poor representation of the brand, restaurant, and the company.
3	I've been a fan of Chipotle since 1998 when they opened their first non-Colorado locationn in Kansas City, MO. Over the years when you walk into any Chipotle like this one at Arroyo Crossing you know what you're going to find. The menu is the same, you know their food with integrity background so you're getting organic products as much as possible. But just in case you've never been to a Chipotle before the other Yelp reviews can tell you how good the food itself is. So this review looks at...space...and cleanliness. The Arroyo Crossing location feels a bit smaller in floor space than some of their other Vegas locations. This location is one where I found full trash cans on more than one occasion. I've also had to ask for drink cup lids more than once. In short it's Chipotle, but not as good as it could be. It does have a row of seats along side the East wall that goes all the way to the back door. Some people like to eat without being in the middle of a lot of people and this location can offer that. And it does have nice sized parking area that's not as hard to get in and out of as some of their other locations are in the valley. Overall rating: 3 Stars.
5	New manager and everyone smiling there. Great all way around!!
4	Chipotle was okay. I must say food is prepared fresh daily. I ordered a steak rice bowl with the white rice steak and corn salsa. it was yummy, but the amount of food was very little. I am not a big Eater and I ate the whole thing. Also had chip and guacamole.  very fresh with huge chucks of fresh avocados inside, nice and creamy.The salsa was very fresh as you could get the Chuck mild one medium or the hot and spicy one. very simple menu to selected from. You can have it in a taco style, burrito, or rice bowl style. I must say that the food was very well prepared, but wish it was a little more hearty for the value that you pay. If I was a big Eater I still would be hungry or hungrier later on.
5	Best chipotle I've been to in Las Vegas. The burrito bowl with carnitas was perfect. I like this location especially because of the size and layout.
1	Terrible today compared to usual. Ran out of everything around lunch and started making our food. No veggies and so the line was held up. Then when they brought them out they weren't cooked and slapped together our food. Was the first time there for my friend and was disappointing for her. Not even a friendly smile in the bunch while serving. Sorely disappointed today. Even my burrito wasn't put together properly and fell apart.
5	I've been going to this chipotle for years and never had an issue. There have been waves of employees that have been better (faster, more engaging, cleaner) than others but as a whole, it's been a good neighborhood location.  Also, this location always seems to have all the ingredients ready for replenishment, whereas others I've been to have been sometimes long waits for ... Chicken. Wtf?Anyhow, shout out to the manager has been there for a while - good job, sir!
5	Such caring management. I had the Facebook QR code and I guess the numbers weren't working and he managed to work his magic and hook us up. Usually we get margaritas when we come for lunch but it's dinner time haha. The bowls here are jam packed with delicious veggies and fresh cooked meats. My absolute favorite chipotle :)Heads up, the lines get loooong!!
1	This was my first & last time going here. I went there around 9:30 (they close at 10) Not only did they seem upset my daughter and I came in they managed to mess up everything on the order to where they had to make it again. They were to busy chatting with their friends at the table behind me while I was ordering. The store was disgusting and near the soda machine you couldn't even set your cup down to put a lid on it, as the whole counter was wet with who knows what! Stay away from this location!
1	Roach by the kitchen door... Considering floor was filthy, makes sense roaches a hanging out. Must note,: roach was on the back squirming around like it was dying and after the staff was notified, they came and swept it up.
4	Just like most Chipotle's - very inconsistant. I have had very good and poor meals from this location.It is still Chipotle, so I will go back!
1	1 star given for this location because they gave me a burrito bowl with absolutely nothing in it. I'm super surprised. I looked at them like...reallyyy? And it still was pretty much an empty bowl. Usually they fill it up and I'm quite irritated at the inconsistent service.
3	Chipotle is my favorite option for a quick meal. It's often my go-to choice when traveling because it's quick, good and relatively healthy. So I've been to many locations nationwide and you could say I am a big Chipotle fan. Unfortunately, this location is the one closest to my home and it is the worst I've ever been to. They are wildly inconsistent. They tend to be pretty busy and I think they try to skimp on portion sizes do they don't run out as fast. One day you have to pay for extra meat to get the same amount of meat you got on another day. And you pretty much always have to pay for extra meat to get what the normal portion is at other locations. With extra steak now being nearly $3, this is straight up ripping off the customers. If you're going to offer a double meat option and place a 40% upcharge on it, you better consistently define those portion sizes.Some of the staff are quite polite and friendly while others are rude. This is pretty standard for fast food or fast casual establishments who employ young people for low wages so I wouldn't judge them on that. However, I have been there at 11am, when they open, and the line is wrapped around the store and out the door and not one staff member is in sight - all were in the back, apparently getting a pre-shift pep talk (you cound hear the cheer when it ended). Service did not start until 11:12! Some people had left. This is lunch hour and many only have 30 minutes - when you start serving 12 minutes late that's nearly half a person's lunch break.
1	I've been to this location multiple times because it is near my house and it's always been okay. Tonight completely left a sour taste in my mouth that wasn't from my mediocre burrito.When my friend and I (who also works with me) arrived, the staff looked extremely unhappy and exhausted. My friend tried to make small talk with the girl who warms the tortillas and she was so exhausted and mentioned it had been busier than normal when my friend asked which is understandable. the girl who was working the line seemed upset as well. it was then I noticed the cashier, Jalon (whose name was on the receipt, which is really convenient when the employees don't wear name tags) was berating the girl working the line for a mistake she had made and for not being further on the pre closing checklist. my friend said to cut her some slack and I interjected that as a manager in my job, I've never treated my employees with such disrespect. she immediately responded that that was her friend and continued to berate the girl. Jalon rang me up incorrectly and when I corrected the order she yelled at the girl working the line and said loudly to me "and see you were trying to defend her!". it was such an uncomfortable situation and I noticed she continued to be rude and abrasive.this is pretty unacceptable for a place of business and I will be contacting this store directly to inform them of how their employees are being treated. no wonder everyone working looked like they'd rather get hit by a bus than be working the line with such a rude person.
2	So lets begin with the fact that this review is due to the performance of a single employee at this location who ruined the entire experience. a few friends and I came in to grab a quick and delicious meal at what has always been one of my favorite little places. got in just before the rush, which is always nice.everything was fine until we reached the condiments section of the building process. the young lady has no sense of any kind of listening skills.My fiance asked for hot salsa, cheese and guacamole... instead he got lettuce... i don't know on what planet lettuce and guacamole sound the same but whatever, maybe its because they are the same color.... when we cried out "no!!!'" the young woman looked up at us, she rolled her eyes at me and said "what?" thats what you ordered." I looked at her and said, "no, he said guacamole." and the dialogue continued...chipotle girl- "do you want me to take it off?"fiance -"yes please that would be great"CG- "there its off" (still a mountain of lettuce covering the majority of the burrito)fiance - "can you please get at least the big pieces off please? or could you maybe remake it?"instead of removing the rest or just simply remaking the item she literally takes guacamole and covers the remaining lettuce and rolls the burrito closed.CG - "its fine the way it is"Last time i check its not your call as to if its "fine" or not. another girl standing on the line next to her made a face to me as if to say "oh my god i'm sorry she's crazy"the problem associate then with a fierce attitude tossed the item into a basket and almost knocked it off of the counter.I've literally NEVER has a worse experience from any other establishment. the manager on duty was busy so i chose not to bother her - the restaurant was beginning to fill and i didn't want to take away from anyone else's experience.In closing I'm pretty sure mouthing off to a customer isn't in the chipotle employee handbook... our entire group was completely taken aback by the complete disregard for any kind of professionalism. I know it seems silly but I was really upset by it.
5	Enjoyed my meal very much. Service was great. Very efficient. Jay was very welcoming and so were the other employees.
5	My bf and I go to this location a lot before work. They remember his order more cause he's always in uniform. Other than that it's always packed and such a good vibe. I love how friendly the staff is and the cleanliness. Thanks chipotle! I might just have some for dinner tonight just talking about it lol :)
5	I don't make it a habit of reviewing chain places, but this is an exceptional location. The service is fast, friendly and helpful. Once they even helped me carry my food to my table when I had my infant carrier. But beyond that, it is just darn delicious!! Best Chipotle I've had. It's as if the cooks actually taste what they are serving instead of just following the recipe, because the seasoning is spot-on every time.
4	chipotle is my jammmmmzzzzzzi love chipotttlllesssssdalkjdal:sdja:sjd"!!!!burrito bowl all day every day. steak dat shit. put some of that cheeeeessseeeeeee!!!!
1	Giving this particular chipotles a 1 star because of their customer service . I go to this particular chipotle a lot because I work close to it. I ordered what I always order which is usually 5 bucks and the lady at the register named jalon told me 12 dollars . So I was like what? And she was trying to blame it on the guy that made my food when I saw him make it correctly. Plus she was trying to make me pay for a bottled water that comes with my meal because a drink comes with this meal and I have never been charged   For in the past . I order the same thing every time and am always charged the exact same until today. And she was arguing with me about it when I come here all the time , what happened to the customer always being right, no instead she basically accused me of lying about the price I am normally charged . I still like chipotle but customer service sucks at this particular location .
5	I go for lunch and even if I see a long line I get out of there fast and everyone is friendly I always tip them
4	Oh Chipotle, I can't get enough of you.  Great lunch place.  The burrito bowl is the bomb.  Healthy and reasonably price.
4	A regular here and outta all the chipotles, this one is my favorite.  A great change and way better than your typical greasy burger joint.  Fast casual is the way to go if your in a dash.  Customizing your bowl and getting that helping of guac and rice surely fills you up!  Plus their music is always bumpin!  From funk to techno and country.  It's just a great place to casually chill or get your belly filled quickly.
3	Chipotle is great and we visit this location about twice each week as this is about . The quality of the food is always consistent and what you normally expect from Chipotle. The service is what you normally get, except it seems that we often get what we consider to be smaller than normal portions of meat in our meals, compared to what we get at other Chipotle locations. If it were not for them being stingy with the meat servings, we would give 4 stars. If they added some more friendly staff, they could even get 5 stars. I know that working fast food is a grind, and that finding good workers in that industry is difficult. However, serving coffee is also a grind, yet the lady at Starbucks always brightens my day with here outstanding attitude. All of this being said, we prefer the Chipotle on the corner of Fort Apache and Sahara.
4	Love chipotle!! But yes one downside is that some of the restaurants are stingy with the meat. Don't be stingy!!! I love my chicken!!!
5	Always delicious and fast, went in for dinner last night and the line was short. They must have been working fast
3	Food is always good. This place does portion control ask for veggies and get about six, ask for salsa and get a shovel full.
5	I love coming to this chipotle. It's so lively everytime I walk in. I love it. They have their food fresh and ready to go for you. I guess it's because they're always busy that their food is always freshly made. But I have been to other chipotle and their food is definitely not the same.  The staffs here are very friendly and nice. They're actually happy to work and serve you unlike other places. I did see one guy ,with a tattoo of a letter A on his left arm, fixing his underwear right where they hand you the food... D: lol kinda grossed me out a bit but I guess it's just a one time thing. I hope. Anyway, their tables and bathrooms are very clean. They always have someone cleaning everywhere so it's pretty clean. The chefs are hilarious bc they actually talk to you and make jokes which I like because I'd always want to come back and eat. It has such a chill and fun environment to be in while eating. It was great. Thanks for reading and o hope this helps. :)
5	You can't ever go wrong with this place! I don't care what any of the bad reviews say. It might of just been a bad experience and now chipotle gets a bad review. The food here is fresh, tasty, and plentiful.I love that they have brown rice, and healthy alternatives. Everything here is good so picking one item is difficult. I personally usually get the burrito with pinto beans (black beans are available though), chicken or steak, brown rice, and cheese! Yum!
