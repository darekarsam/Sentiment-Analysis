5	Born and raised in Vegas, Priscilla is definitely the queen of the fade, best I've seen. Easy to talk to, great environment.
5	I've been one of Priscilla's many loyal customers for almost two years now. NOBODY else ever cuts my hair; simply because nobody does a better job than her.She's an endangered species, a thoroughly competent and personable professional who takes her client happiness and satisfaction to heart. No "chop-shop"here!Five starts because I cannot give TEN.Highly recommended!
5	Priscilla does an awesome job on my hair! My husband only trusts her to even touch his hair ( he is very picky). I always walk out with a smile because she has nailed every look I ever wanted to try. She is awesome!
5	i love this locations of priscys she has been cutting my hair since i was a young adult and it grows so fast and pretty thank you
5	Priscilla has been cutting my hair for 2 years and I hate going to anyone else. I was sad when I had to move to Cali but I always wait to get a cut from her when I come to Vegas. Her attention to detail and passion for doing hair always shows. She is such a great person and stylist. Male or female, if you are looking for a great stylist to always go to, Priscilla is it.
