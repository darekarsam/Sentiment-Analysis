5	Love the ambiance of Massage Heights. The employees are very professional...I especially like to speak with Mandy at the front desk. She is professional, yet makes her conversations with more personal, like you are someone she has know for awhile and considers you a friend.Chistina is one of the best therapists that I have ever had massage me. She has been able to work some knots out of my back that I thought would be impossible to ever get out! :)Thank you Maassage Heights!
3	This is my first ever massage hoping to relieve severe back pain. I've tried PT and Chiropractic but neither has provided long-term, if not permanent, relief. I've been meaning to try out a massage but have been putting it off. I haven't had a decent sleep in over two months!  So I came in, the staff is nice enough and my masseuse is amazing.  I signed up for 6 months after this visit.
4	I really enjoyed my massage! It was definitely one of the best I've had in this area. I would recommend this place for sure.
2	I called last minute and was very excited to be able to get a massage in the next hour. I rushed through traffic to get there a bit early as I was asked to do. I arrived at the Cotswold shopping center but couldn't find it so I called for help and they informed me my appointment was at the stonecrest location. Confused, I cancelled, hung up and went back on Google to take another look. The phone number was the same and the address was for the Cotswold location. I called back and told them my situation and to which they replied "yes, we have a Cotswold location that is under construction and their phone calls are being transferred to us." I cannot understand why they wouldn't find it important to let me know, after I told them I heard about them on the Internet, that the Cotswold location wasn't open right now. So I rushed, wasted a bunch of time and was extremely disappointed I wasn't able to get my massage I was very excited about and desperately needed.
