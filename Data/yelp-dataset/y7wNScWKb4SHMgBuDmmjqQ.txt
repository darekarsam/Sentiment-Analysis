2	Great food but flawed by poor service. I wanted to love this place, great location, interior, trendy, interesting menu. However the overall experience was very subpar. There seemed to be around ten waiters and waitresses. Each time a different person would serve the table, resulting in confusion to the point where some dishes did not even arrive. No apologies given. Would probably visit again, but only once they settle in a bit more.
3	Went for lunch today. Nothing great on the 6-7 item menu. Had the ramen. Noddles seemed homemade and broth was tasty but lacked zing. Still in opening-restaurant mode after one month: no espresso cups, no choices of tea, couldn't get a gift certificate yet, etc. I'll have to come back and see what they're best for: French-Japanese cart dinner  So far, nothing more than average.
5	The food here was excellent and the service was amazing. The menu choices are very interesting and full of taste. The twists on Western food are descent and not too out there and the more traditional Izakaya is very good. I also like the choices they bring around on the Giridon. The layout is modern Izakaya with lots of seats close together but still some separate seating for the less community oriented people. Everyone should try this place!
