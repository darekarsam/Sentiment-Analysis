4	This location is located in the lobby of the UNC Charlotte - Uptown Campus building that recently opened in August of 2011.  Great location especially since you have a captive market of college/night school students coming in an out from class.I'm sure their menu is a bit limited given this "satellite" location, but it still gives you an option to get a snack or some much needed caffeine before class.  I took advantage of grabbing a wrap and a coffee.  Watch the sizes, since they only offer Medium and Large drink sizes.  I guess if I had the metabolism of a college student, I wouldn't mind, but this is me and the medium size coffee was a good 20oz...  Needless to say, I took full advantage of the break we had in class to take care of all that liquid.The wrap was kinda over-priced, but I was super hungry and half of it hit the spot (I saved the other half for lunch the next day since it was so packed full of turkey, tomatoes, onions, a little lettuce, and some 'mexi' sauce).  The best thing about the location is the seating area, added with the floor to ceiling windows give a great backdrop of the city.  A great 'break' to sit and people-watch before the next class.
1	I live in first ward and am constantly disappointed. This place seems to be never open! I just walked up there this morning with my family and it was closed. At 9am on a Tuesday! And I never see any business hours. I have tried many times and it is always closed. Any idea on actual hours? Not a very easy neighborhood bagel place. Luckily there is 7th st market. They get our business when this place is not opened. Which is quite often.
1	Tried again. Not open. To the ppl who own/run this location- you are not neighborhood friendly. #einsteinbagel
