1	I was referred to this company by my wedding venue which only allows a handful of caters to work at their establishment. The first tasting went very well, when I emailed asking for specific items and made a second appointment that is when I was called an "over zealous bride." That the tasting was just to give confidence in his skills and that he would not be doing 15 tastings for one bride and that there are 10,000 other caters in AZ and to pick one of them. The lack of professionalism was honestly astounding. It has been the worst experience of planning my wedding and took me completely off guard as the flip from nice to disgustingly rude was instantaneous.
5	A Savory Affair catered my daughters wedding this weekend and they did an amazing job! The food was absolutely delicious and they were punctual, friendly, helpful and professional. Many people complicated us on the food and the menu that we had for the buffet. Thank you Chef for helping to make my daughter's wedding fantastic and memorable!
5	The food was terrific and Chef Tim was a pleasure to work with. We had filet mignon and pork medallions which everyone raved about. Guests are very picky about food at weddings and all of ours were happy with the food and the beautiful presentation.
