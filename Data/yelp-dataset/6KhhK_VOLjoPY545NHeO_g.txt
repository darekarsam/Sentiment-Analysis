5	Profesional fence and deck installer
5	Very happy with Raphael and his team. They were affordable and very efficient. They got my fence up in 4 hours, I have a small yard but a project like that would have taken me 4 days (4 weeks if you ask my wife) and not have looked as good. Even when my HOA threw a curve ball at us they adjusted and made it look great. I appreciated Raphael's service. Every time I call him he answered the phone or called me back right away. I recommend this company.
1	Lies! Takes your survey and claims he will write everything up for your HOA since he deals with them all the time and get your fence approval.  Come to find out months later the HOA never spoke to this guy and he has a bad rep for telling similar lies!  Now I'm having to work with my HOA and neighbor to resolve the issue of never being approved.  Owner of this fence company has since stopped answering my phone calls and he will be facing a small claim law suit if more money has to go into this fence.  Avoid this company and look elsewhere!!
