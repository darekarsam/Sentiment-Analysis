5	Everyone in this law firm that helped on my case was amazing. My 2 felony case dismissed and during the 3 month period of waiting Jeremy Geigle & his staff were always available to answer questions, stay in touch with updates, and allowed me to be on a payment plan. Bit pricey but can't put a price on justice! Because of this law firm I continue to have a squeaky clean criminal background.
