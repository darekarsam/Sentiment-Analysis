1	Horrible is not the word for this company. Minus 5 stars!! They don't return call or emails. They keep your refund and give you no just cause!! How can this company be in business?? Please, Please don't use this company. I filed a complaint with the BBB and I suggest you do the same if you were done wrong by this company. They have to be stopped!! They cant keep taking hard working people's money and get away with it.
3	My lease just ended with them and honestly They are just like any other management company. Anytime something broke in the house someone was over in the next few days to fix it. We ended up getting our full security deposit back which I was happy about. Would I rent from them again? Probably not just because of their customer service when I called. Always rude and almost mad that I am calling with a question.
1	WARNING!!!! Do NOT rent or use this company for your management needs. If you rent from them say goodbye to your entire deposit. I was renting a property managed by this company and not only did they took my entire deposit but they are actually charging me more on top of that. I left the house in great condition. I added landscape and took really good care of it. This are very bad people. They take advantage of common renters like you or me.
1	WARNING! For the well being of one's sanity and mental health DO NOT RENT from this company. Terri White the Corporate broker/Manger has no professionalism and is a completely rude. A one year old has more integrity and manners than Terri and her whole team. I wonder if the commissioner of  Reality knows that the only place Terri deserves to manger is her ass. This company is a JOKE! I hope 2015 will the end of the company and its unprofessional ways. I wish I could make a BIG YELP sign stating to visit this website first before dealing business with them. Horrible, Horrible company!
