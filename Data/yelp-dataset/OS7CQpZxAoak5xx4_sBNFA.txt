5	Furbabies was started by a trained chef name Angela...and get this....he husband John is the human treat taster!!  He does not have it bad, as I must admit, they do look and smell pretty tempting.  I am extremely picky and conscientious of what I feed my furbabies, so I LOVE that these are grain free, BHA free, meat by product free and dye free.  They use human grade ingredients and do not use preservatives, by products, salt, artificial ingredients or sugar.   My pups are picky in the treat department and they woof this down and wag their tails happily.  I learned about them at Whole Foods' Yelp Gets Schooled Event.  I love that you can buy in bulk.  If you want to treat yo pup, I suggest you do so!  Hit up a demo if you can, she hooked me up with a bag of treats (one of each kind) for each of my babies...way cool.
