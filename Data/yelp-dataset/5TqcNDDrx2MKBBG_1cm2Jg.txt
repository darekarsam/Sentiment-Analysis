5	I highly recommend Massage N You.  I chose to have a massage here initially because of the great introductory price and proximity to my home; however, after meeting Lucas and having my first massage with him, I was thoroughly impressed with his skill, knowledge, caring nature, and love for what he does.   This is all very apparent during the massage, and he customizes the massage to your specific needs.  Since I lead a very active lifestyle (hiking, yoga, running), I have since returned to him several times to treat sore or pulled muscles, pinches nerves, etc and each time, I have left with significant improvement as he truly knows how to work at the source of the pain and restore mobility.  It is a relaxing, comfortable atmosphere, and the complimentary aromatherapy is an added bonus!
5	I received a massage from Lucas today, he did a great job. He concentrated on the areas I asked him to and provided the deep tissue massage that I was looking for. I will be a repeat customer !
5	I went here a few weeks ago. Lucas is great- I told him that I had been diagnosed with carpal tunnel and he was able to figure out that most of my problems were actually coming from knots in my chest, neck, and head that were hitting nerves and making my hands go numb. He took a lot of extra time to explain how things work with the chart of the muscles, and show me some stretches that would help my issues. Since my massage, I haven't had any problems with my carpal tunnel and my neck soreness was completely gone.  I can't wait to schedule another massage with him! Also, the price is great...
