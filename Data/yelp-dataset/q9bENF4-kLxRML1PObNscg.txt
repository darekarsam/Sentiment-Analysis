4	I am so glad this Morrisons Local is here! Living in the city centre can conjure fears of dreaded expensive supermarket experiences but while this place is quite small, it doesn't feel like I'm paying double what I would be in a superstore a bit further out. It's no Lidl or Aldi but they have some fierce specials, especially later in the evening, and it's darn convenient.
