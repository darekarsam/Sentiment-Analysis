1	The worse club I have ever been too...  I never pay for a club, but here it was a 10 dollar cover.  The music was terrible, the drinks were just ok, and the music was aweful.  Next time I'm in Charlotte we will not be hitting this place up...
4	Parking free, drinks are doubles, free w/guestlist.  Spanish dancing all night in a classy location!
1	This place is now closed. Thank Christ!Let's hope it's replaced with something even a little better. Shouldn't be too difficult.
