5	Parc Laurier is a 5 star park for sure, what with the newly shady and sizeable pool, the ping pong tables, the great leafy expanses of gently rolling grass dappled with adorable picnic'ers, the tidy old timey public bathrooms and overall sense of laid back community.
5	We've been playing anarchist soccer in Parc Laurier every sunday in the summer for what, like, six years now?  And it's just an awesome parc. We play next to the dog park and man, those dogs go nutso in there. It'd be awesome to do a giant soccer game - dogs vs people except they'd totally win.But yeah, aside from soccer, there's a sweet pool, a massive kiddy park, 2 (count'em, 2) baseball diamond, a huge massive soccer field (which we don't play on, it's so intimidating), and now ping-pong tables and more nook and crannies for you to have a picnic than is even mathematically possible. It's the kind of parc where you go and you're bound to run into one of your buds.So yeah, get your summer on at parc Laurier!
5	Parc Laurier is either my favourite or second favourite park in the city. Big leafy, shady trees in the summer keep this ginger from burning to a crisp, but also a tiny skating area in the Winter to keep me entertained...this park truly has a bit of everything. The swimming pool is lovely (and freaking cold!), the grass areas are plentiful, the public washrooms are decent and close and helloooo, there are ping pong tables, niiiiice. People BBQ, drink wine and act their age here; now that's a great Montreal park!
5	Seriously the dreamiest parc ever. Huge tree canopies, lovely benches and trails, tons of dogs & people on blankets. Picnics, outdoor pool, baseball fields, and a fenced in dog parc. It is truly perfect! A+
5	My favorite park in a city full of them. I love also the surroundings. For me, that's the best area in the popular Plateau.
