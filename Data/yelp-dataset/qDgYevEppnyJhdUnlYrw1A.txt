5	I love this church!  I have attended this church since 2002. Pastor Mark is a great Bible teacher and  there are lots of things to do for adults and children.
5	Be aware of the pastors of this church, carefully observe some of the pastors who are allowed to lead while separating from their wives (with only the most superficial injunctions), or are  living effectively separate lives from their wives. Just a small amount of question asking about the marital relationships of the pastors will unsettle you.  Don't take my word at face value - please don't,  Just ask around with an open heart and mind and decide for youself.  The truth is surprisingly easy to find, it's very close to the surface somehow at this church.
