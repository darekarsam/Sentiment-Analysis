5	This was my first time at Two Blondes and a Brush. Amanda cut and highlighted my hair today, and I cannot say how much I love it! I showed her some pictures of what I was going for and she assured me it would work for my hair type. I went from hair mid-way down my back to just above my shoulders! It is a huge change but it looks fantastic! The layers are perfect and the highlights are beautiful too. My husband loved it as well! She was very friendly and we chatted comfortably the whole time. I'll definitely be back!
5	I have been going to Amanda for a few months now and she has helped me get my hair healthy and beautiful . I have  see her work on a lot of my friends and she rocks!  Plus she is always good for a laugh. I definitely recommend her!
5	Amanda is amazing! I bought the Groupon, being new to the area and not having a hair stylist yet. I LOVE my hair! I am always a little hesitant going to someone new without a friend referring me, but take my word: she's awesome! I love my cut and partial highlight, AND she has a great personality. Highly recommend, even if you have to wait a week or two to get in. I'm sure she is booked out a ways!
5	Best haircut and highlights/lowlights I've had in a long time. Amanda is a lot of fun to talk to and she does amazing work. This was my first appointment with her and I already scheduled my next one. You won't go wrong with getting your hair done with Amanda! I highly recommend her!
