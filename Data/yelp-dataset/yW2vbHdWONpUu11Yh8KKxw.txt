5	Friendly staff and efficient service. I have been using Collins services since they opened for business and won't go anywhere else for my dry cleaning.
1	Really disappointed with the service from Collins Cleaners. Apparently, they service the Marriott Hotel at South Park. Collins totally dropped the bail on my order. I sent in six dress shirts through the hotel with specific instructions for folding and starch. Received back the order at night with the shirts neither folded or starched.   Collins couldn't even follow clear instructions and of course tried to charge me full fare.
1	Worst cleaners ever! I got a call my dress was ready I get there from living all the way in southend to see that there is stains on the dress after they called me 3 times telling me it's ready for pick up. Then the girl asks for me to pay for it when it's not even ready I told her no! I'll pay when I see it's done right. I get another call that it's done and go back dress looks fine and the lady says sorry can't accept your coupon it should have been presented when you dropped the dress and I told her I did the other girl told me to hold on and bring it when I pick it up. Nope sorry can't do it now that's the kind of service you get there. NEVER GO THERE!!
5	Collins Cleaners did a great job on my comforter after my dogs got red mud all over it. It now looks brand new.
