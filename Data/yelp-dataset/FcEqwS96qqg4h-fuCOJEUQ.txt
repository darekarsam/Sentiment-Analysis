5	Super chill bar right by my house, they also serve wine. And they just opened, check it out!
5	Nice clean new place with a great owner.  Chris is quick to make you feel at home and is new so is really great about getting in what the quests want.  Have nascar on Sundays with beer specials, bloody sake bar and food specials.

1	Quite lame, too light inside, terrible choice of food/snacks? Bartender pompous (not the owner), hard to park nearby.Great Sake, Cold Beer, and Satellite TV is a bonus.
5	I'm from out of town and was bored so I went out for a drink. Wasn't expecting much since it was a Monday night. I stopped at 3 different bars before coming here. Most of which were good in there own right but I felt most welcome and at home at SO Lounge. Mostly thanks to the owner/bartender Chris (female). And the locals there were also friendly and welcoming.Not a sports bar but if your looking for a chill friendly place to have a drink this is the place.
