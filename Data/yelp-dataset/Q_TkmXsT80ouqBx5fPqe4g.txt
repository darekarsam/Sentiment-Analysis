1	This was by far the worst restaurant I've ever been to. First off it took 20 minutes to get seated although restaurant was virtually empty. Then another 10 for someone to come see us. We got our appetizer of calamari. It was severely undercooked. And we weren't refunded for it. Then my gnocchi tasted like dough and was undercooked. My gfs pizza tasted like a plate of salt. And the meal costed 120$ also only a bite was taken out of each plate. I've never been so angry in my life. The waitress was rude and didn't care. And the manager was way worse. I hate you Andrea whoever you are. Will never return. Even if they paid to eat here I wouldn't. So mad!
1	Horrible service. Food and drinks were not very good, bland and greasy. Wont be going back!
