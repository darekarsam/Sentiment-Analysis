1	If I could give no stars I would! RIP OFF artists! Told my brother he needed a crown and build up and that his tooth was "disintegrating" in his mouth. Tooth has never had so much as a filling and is in perfect health! HORRIBLE!!! STAY AWAY!
1	This place is the biggest ripoff.  Every time we go in there go in there, there's a different dentist and are always trying to sell you work. This place deserves no stars. They should fire the current Dentist  that is there.
1	Worst experience ever. First my husband went here to have some work done and told them to only do what our insurance covers but instead they did what they wanted to do then told him he had to pay for it even though he told them to only do what our insurance pays 100% of. So now we got stuck with a bill. You would think after that we would have learned our lesson but Then i went in for a root canal may be 1 week later after my husband. I asked for laughing gas so that i can relax better. After he claim he numb my mouth he begin to drill and i can feel the pain. The stupid ass dentist kept telling me that the pain is mental, that it is all in my head. I am a mother of 6 kids, i know what the hell pain feel like. I begin to cry and tell him i am in pain. My husband was in lobby and could hear me crying and came back there. The dentist claim he numb me enough. He shot me in my gum with the needle one time. Im no dentist but i know one time is not enough for a damn root canal. To make a long story short, he didnt continue with the procedure and i left. I left in more pain than i was before i walked into there doors. And i still have to find another dentist to complete the root canal. I have contacted my insurance and made a complaint about the dentist. I Will never and i mean never go here or recommend anyone to this place to anyone, not even my worst enemy
