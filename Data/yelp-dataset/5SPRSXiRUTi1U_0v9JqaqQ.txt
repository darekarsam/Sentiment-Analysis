5	I just enjoyed an amazing 60 minute massage here and it made me feel wonderful. The staff was very friendly, personable and the whole process was easy. I actually had a flat tire on the way and so I was a little late but they didn't hold it against me. You can do a cheaper 30 minute massage or go mid range like I did or you can really treat your self and do a high end 90 minute massage. They offer a range of services and just wow, do it for yourself!
5	This place is a gem since it is a small 'medspa' it doesn't pull in as much traffic off the street, but the quality is at the same level of the associated medical care!  I had a 60 minute massage with Alyssa, I have regular massages and this was one of the best I've ever had!  She was able to target my knots while still giving a relaxing massage.  They do price match and have good coupons, so I highly recommend checking them out!
5	OMG, thanks to Alyssa I feel like a human again!!! I had a prenatal 30 minutes massage and she work on me!!! Beautiful environment with friendly staff.. Good job guys!! I will see you soon!
5	I had an hour massage today and it felt amazing. I haven't felt that relaxed in a long time. They did a great job at finding knots I didn't know I had, and working them out. I'll be going back for sure.
