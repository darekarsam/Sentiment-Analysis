5	I have always had a great experience at this Arby's.  Although I am not a fan of roast beef, they have many other options such as chicken and salads and their curly fries are amazing!  Their dining area is clean, the staff is always very friendly and the food is tasty and relatively cheap.  I definitely recommend this establishment!
5	This has got to be the nices Arby's I've ever been in. Most of them are spaced strangely like the one close to Baseline and 7th St. in Phoenix.The service was great. Food made fresh and they call out to you with a smile on their face. They say goodbye! when you're leaving. Food itself was your typical Arby's. I gotta figure out where I can buy my own Arby's Sauce though.
1	Ordered pecan chicken salad. Got it ate it and thought "that was the blandest chicken salad ever". Just happened to look at my receipt and see it was supposed to be PECAN chicken salad; I did not have a single piece of pecan in the entire salad! I took my receipt up to the counter and the manager was standing there when the cashier asked if he could assist me. When I explained the situation the manager just turned around and started asking who made it and totally ignored me. I walked out spending almost $8 on the salad and drink with bad customer service from management. I'll never go back :(
5	Hands down, my favorite location.  I have been coming here for years.  The staff is one of the friendliest in the biz.  I rarely have had an issue, but whenever I have, the staff have gone above and beyond to resolve and/or compensate for the error.  I also appreciate the fact that they make an effort to remember the names of regular guests, no matter how infrequent.  I'm thinking THIS Arby's!
