4	Great food quick and easy and at a very reasonable price. I've order from here all the time
2	Went here a week ago and placed an order online, tell me why the ready time said it would be ready at this time, but when I got there at that time, it was another 20 min wait? Upon that wait, they forgot that I was still there for my order and also forgot a food item and put something completely different in my bag. They also double charged me on my order when I told them I paid online!!
5	First time experience wasn't so great, then we realized how to order the product. Don't get the dark meat chicken. Extra charge for White meat but its definitely worth the extra $1. We also get the noodles! Delicious! My Boyfriends loves the honey walnut shrimp and I'd have to agree with him =) Enjoy!
