5	Looked like a mom and pop place. Tried it for the first time and it was good Mexican food. I had a beef torta and bean and cheese burrito. Price is cheap and reasonable.
3	The food is fine. The only thing I would recommend never ordering is anything with 'cabeza' in it. I love cabeza, but theirs is salty as hell. Completely inedible.Also, every time I go there things seem to  have a different price(and I'm not talking about the menu prices, I'm talking about the amount charged). The owner should probably watch his employees closely.
