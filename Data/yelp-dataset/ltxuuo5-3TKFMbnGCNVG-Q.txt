5	Derek came out and I had things fixed in no time...He evaluated my problem and didn't gouge me like has been my experience with two other companies...not only was he on time, but early!!
2	I haven't used their service but a few minutes ago a RUDE employee in a company truck honked and yelled at us during a red light and rush hour traffic when we couldn't turn because of a short light.... .yeah, that will make me ever use their business!
1	I had a new unit installed and have had nothing but problems with there poor workmanship. Eventually I had to a get a lot of it redone by a professional.
