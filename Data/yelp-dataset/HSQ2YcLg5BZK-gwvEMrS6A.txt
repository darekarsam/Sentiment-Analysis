5	I had tried at least 3 other dentists in the valley before a friend recommend Dr. Belden. So I have experienced a lot of different valley denist offices and his is the best on every level!  Starting the receptionists, these ladies are so kind that they make each patient feel valuable and cared for. The assistants and hygienists are amazing! Carol really knows her craft as a dental hygienist, for example I had sinus surgery and started tasting metal and Carol immediately knew the problem I changed to a dental powder and poof problem solved.  Dr. Belden is also a craftsmen - he does amazing work and is so gentle. Unlike others, he has always taken the time to make sure that any filling or cap has the proper fit and bite.I write this review in part because I was amazed at no one had wrote one before- especially consider all the folks that I know that go to this office.

5	Dr. Belden came highly recommended by a friend and I needed a new dentist since I'm a transplant from the SF Bay Area.The staff is so friendly, and they make you feel welcome and relaxed.  De. Belden is wonderful, takes time to explain things and give you options for your dental care.  The whole office is  kind and considerate to your financial situations, scheduling restrictions, etc., and they do all they can do to help you obtain a healthy mouth and a good outcome.  I recommend Dr. Belden and his staff to anyone who is looking for a great dentist!  Smile!
