5	Having had Electrolysis treatment  before, I already knew most of what to expect. My 1rst. visit to Blair was absolutely wonderful. She had answers to questions i didn't even know I had. Her service is a wonderful experience and first rate. I'm happy and will discontinue searching for a place for treatment. I will definitely continue to seek her services. Yes I am that pleased with her service. http://www.elementalwi.com/
5	Sorry to say that I'm not going as often as I used to, but not because of the service. Blair is the one to go to for permanent hair removal. She's kind, friendly, caring, but she's all that and get's the job done! Her place is always clean. Which is why you too which each visit will see that final day and have to say Thank you for all your great work. When I need to come back, I know you'll be here.
