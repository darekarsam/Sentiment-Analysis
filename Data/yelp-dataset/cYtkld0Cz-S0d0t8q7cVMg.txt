5	Awesome! We had the Texas pesto shrimp at a friend's house from here Friday night. It was so good I went to their store saturday and picked up 3 meals for this week to try. Great idea for dinners!! Oh and the pumpkin cookies were amazing!
5	My friend hosted a birthday party and had the Sweet Potato Enchiladas amongst the fare, and I have been obsessed with them ever since. Just buy them, lots of them and top them with sour cream and/or salsa if you want to live dangerously. Also get the Cheeseburger casserole with pickles. You will not be disappointed.
