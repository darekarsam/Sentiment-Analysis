4	Cow pie! We went to Andersons for our Hogmanay steak pie and it was scrumptious: lots of tasty filling, topped by thick and delicious puff pastry. The rest of the meat on display looked good too, and staff were friendly - I'll definitely go back.
4	They're local and provide a good selection of fresh meat. Staff here are very helpful and always happy to advise on cooking or even a full recipe. The few times I visited I was pleased to see that many locals do shop here. I struck up a little chat with the lady from the flat above ours. You should be prepared at times - as it will be busy - especially on Tuesdays - when the freshest meats have arrived. I would have expected them to be really expensive, but they're very affordable - especially when you know that the beef is actually beef from a local herd.
