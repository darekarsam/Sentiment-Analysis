4	Nice new building, staff was friendly and helpful.  Jet A is very expensive (more so than NY).    Typical amenities.
2	Nice facilities. Line guys are awesome, desk staff not so much. Fuel is uber-expensive, but ramp fees aren't too bad if you don't meet minimum fuel requirements to waive the fee.  This is what you get when there's no competitors on the field.
3	Comfortable, quiet, clean, and friendly place to wait for your private flight. Lots of electrical outlets to power up your devices.
