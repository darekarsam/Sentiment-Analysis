4	I love the channel, but if you ever get the chance to check out their office, it's really cute. I grew up in Latrobe (Mr. Roger's real neighborhood) and really appreciated that most of the space was dedicated to preserving his good name.If you get a chance to have a meeting or tour there, take it!
4	You can now rent out the original studio's Mr Rogers Neighborhood was shot in!  Seriously, if you were searching for a unique venue for an event or wedding this is your place!  They've decorated it with twinkling lights behind a black screen so it gives it an intimate feel.  So jealous I couldn't have snatched this up when I was getting married.  PLUS Mr. Rogers old castle and tree is on display in the lobby, which of course is a killer decoration!  I believe it holds 250 for a seated dinner and around 400 for a cocktail event/reception.  I don't think the puppets would be suitable guests though, so find some real ones:)
