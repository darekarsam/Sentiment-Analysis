1	was a nice place to live at first. and then the A/C started dripping, the microwave burned up, the washer and dryer were old and cost a fortune to run, the neighors downstairs started to complain about us just walking in the kitchen, because the floors are thin. And to top it all off we got ripped off over 750 dollars for moving out of a clean Apt. tryin to deal with the office staff is impossible.  Worst place to live. YOU WILL BE SORRY YOU MOVED THERE.
2	I've lived in some pretty cruddy places before but I think this one defiantly takes the gold medal for shady offices, renters, and staff.  It looks okay during the daytime and it even takes pitbulls which is why we signed the lease. The apartment they show you looks nothing like the one you re going to live in despite them charging you an arm and a leg when you move out. The walls are usually cracked (it looked like someone punched a hole into our bathroom wall) and the kitchen is older than I am. The office staff seem genuinely uncaring and can boarder on being condescending and snide. The pool isn't cleaned often and the grounds are a mess. I lived in Solara in Tempe next to crackheads before and I can honestly say I felt safer there than I did at Coronado. The staff tells you they do background checks and blah blah blah but with police roaming the grounds every night and domestic issues happening weekly I don't believe that for a minute. Just know other apartments take pitbulls and other big breeds and you dont need to put up with this place.
2	I've lived here for over 2 years now and the staffing that work here are horrible. The complex is kept looking nice from the outside but nothing is ever done to update the inside of the apartments except fresh paint. They half ass everything. Only gave 2 stars because it's the nicest complex in this area and they don't have breed restrictions on dogs.
