1	A small useless company run by amateurs. Very disappointed in the lack of concern towards me. Not worth the hassle of signing their lease , very poor and shameful !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	Cowboys!!!!!!! Not a business , this is a sham, let out their flats to any walk of life especially those who come without manners and any thought of noise to neighbours . Disgusting business .
1	Amateurs amateurs amateurs , idiots idiots idiots , they are a joke and take money for this -that explains it all!!!!
1	Still having to put up with a tenant from Bruce Rae making noise from his rented flat, they take in students so you can imagine the  racket I have to put up with- I have asked this so called professional business to deal with this matter and all I got was " I have had a word" what a shower of imbeciles .
1	Absolute terrible company to rent from , stay away from them . They take your deposit and do not return it as they find excuses.
