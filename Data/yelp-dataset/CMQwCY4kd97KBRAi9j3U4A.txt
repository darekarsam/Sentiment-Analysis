4	Rows of candied apples!!This is a relatively new addition to the epicness that is Carrefour Laval. Right next to the dining area, in front of an ice cream stand, this boutique WILL make you stop dead in your tracks. The display is phenomenal: they have all the candied and caramel apples you might want, for Halloween, for Christmas, to celebrate your love for the Habs, marshmallows on top with gummy bears and coconut shavings.. Now would be a good time to sever all ties with your pancreas.I have tried their candied apples and they are luscious! Crisp and rich.. My parents are fans of their fudges, which they sell in 1-inch thick slices. Their caramel tough.. Well, this is a candy store, so don't expect the finest quality-chocolate. This is my only complaint: it is candy-quality chocolate and candy-quality caramel meaning, corn syrup galore! My stomach can only take so much..You can expect an apple to be between $6 and $13, a slice of fudge is in the same prices..
4	I can not believe this place exists! "CAN I WORK HERE"???I am a very big chocolate fan, and I come here for my sweet treats. The fudge is great and tasty, and the great thing is that make it on the spot. They do have Caramel Apples, which i have not tried yet, but they look really juicy. Bring the kids, and they will go crazy! The sugar rush fills the air of the entire place. I highly recommend this place to fill you sweet tooth.
