4	My husband and I go out at least once a week to buy his magazines.  Border's has become our preferred bookstore because they always have the magazines he likes to read and I love their rewards card.  Tonight we went in to make our weekly purchase and talk to the staff.  They have a great group of people working there.  They are always helpful and knowledgeable about so many different subjects. While it is a chain store it gives the feeling of being a community store.
3	A nice walk through books that always turn out cheaper online. Despite they have some good deals, I always end up buying my books online or in Changing hands. It is nice to take a coffee and just look around. Anyway, it seems they are about to close as they are on sale after sale...too bad bookstores closing more often!
4	Nice atmosphere, great staff only place I can find Top Gear magazine!! I think this is what Borders is known for, having a broader selection. This magazine is published in Britain and it's hard to find in the states.
