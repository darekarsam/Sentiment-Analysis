5	Wonderful service and very relaxing atmosphere.   Will definitely get my next manicure done here again.The free parking is always appreciate - especially downtown.
5	Mani padi - great job! Came out a very happy girl! They offered Brazilian too. Shall give it a try next visit!
1	Most dissatisfying hair-cutting experience ever. Went in asking for a long and typical layered look but came out with a short, blunt and jagged cut. Pino speaks very highly of himself and his work but in actuality the service he provided was the opposite. I will not be returning nor would I recommend anyone else to do so either.
4	I was in town for a wedding and we booked hair updos there and manis and my friend also got a pedi. I was very happy with the service. Staff are super nice and friendly and our updos came out great! Also, they squeezed me in for a mani last-minute - thank God! Because my nails were a mess.  Nice place to go !
5	Amazing people there! I got a mani-pedi and got exactly what I wanted and left super happy and with super flawless nails! :) I so recommend going to this salon and I am super excited to go back.
