5	I have a store online so I am  always shipping obscure items. Whenever I come in the owners and associates are always so helpful. Any questions I have about sizing of boxes or shipping advice they are always glad to give  helpful and knowledgeable advice.
5	I've been here to ship things for work, and to ship things for my own online business. No matter what you're shipping they are so nice and so helpful. Plus I've never had to wait in line like at the post office or FedEx.
5	I come here often and every time I've been welcomed by the staff, who are knowledgeable and helpful, and I've been in and out within just a few minutes -unlike when I go to the post office and stand around for 5 minutes in line just to finally reach the counter and stand there for 5 minutes! They ship via every carrier so they'll always find you the best rate, and, like most shipping places, they sell packing supplies too so it's a one-stop-shop :)
