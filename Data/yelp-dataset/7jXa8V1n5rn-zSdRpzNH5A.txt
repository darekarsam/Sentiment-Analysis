4	I know I go to Montreal for Chinese food. Doesn't entirely make sense but you know what? Glad I checked his place out. Very central if you are staying at the Meridian on Sherbrooke st.I really would have given this place a 5 star but I had a few iffy dishes...So there's the recap:1. This place is so cheap. You will be full having spent $13 with tip....2. Skip the soup and the side dishes. I would have paid more for better soup!! The hot and sour soup was so starchy with a few pieces of tofu and seaweed. I also ordered the seaweed. That was just tons of sugar and vinegar....3. Xiao long bao!!! That's what you want to get. I ordered the pork leek because that is my go to and the most traditional dumpling filling really. So what is a xiao long bao? It's a soup filled dumpling and they are really soupy! So watch out for your first bite.4. Sauce... Ask for Ginger and mix it with black vinegar (this is how elitists and elites do it!!!) with a dash of soy sauce... You're welcome.Until my next food adventure! Hiyay!
5	Delicious juicy home made xiao long bao. Sweet Pork are my favorites. Fried dumplings are excellent too. Note that you can also see the ladies make the dumplings through the window :)
5	Finally a place to get my Xiao long boa fix. I go to toronto but no more. Their spice also is 5 star along with the smile and service which you do not get at most other chinese dumpling places. Although I have never seen lamb XLB in china they make them here and I love them. The pork are just as good but as a Greek we love lamb. I can have it on anything,
