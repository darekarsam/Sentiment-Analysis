5	They have some of the best blended coffee. I work above this place so I pass it every morning and there is always a line. The girl in the morning is great! Super nice and always does a great job with my peanut butter chocolate coffee.
4	This is a very cool location for a coffee shop: right in PPG Place.  It was a perfect stop for my family and I in between our Holiday adventure to see the decorations.  They have a large variety of sweets including cookies and biscotti and a friendly staff who is willing to help you choose you sugar future.  They were, however, out of their flavor and did not have any brewed when we were there.  Very sad I know, but the Red Velvet biscotti made up for it.
4	This was a nice little stop downtown while we were doing out rounds at the arts festival.  Was not busy at all, and we were able to get in and out quickly.  The staff were polite and had our drinks made in no time flat.  It was that quick that I wasn't able to notice anything else about this place except that it had outdoor seating, that's how quickly they work here.
