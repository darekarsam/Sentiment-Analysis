5	This is the only dentist I've ever been to in my life.  Yes, I live in Boston now.  No, that doesn't mean I don't go to the dentist now.  I still go to him!  This is how much I love my dentist.  My whole family does.  When my dad was 2 he went to see a dentist and the dentist hurt him so he bit his hand.  So the dentist smacked him across the face!  Sure it was 1957, but still!  So my dad's mom immediately switched dentists to Dr. Hull.  And then Dr. Sowell joined Dr. Hull years later.  This is how we got started here, and my family has never left!  My dad has been going to the same practice for so long!They are always awesome with scheduling my appointments since I come from out of town also.  I'll be there in a few weeks and I'm already looking forward to my visit!
4	I love Dr. Sowell and all of his office staff.  I could not find it in me to give a dentist 5-stars.  I dread, and I do mean, DREAD going to the dentist. His hygenists are awesome.  Melissa is my favorite.  HIs front desk staff is wonderful.  For those suffering from severe dental anxiety, he will give a magic pill 30 minutes prior to any work to be done.  I have not done this... yet.He also sees well-behaved children. That said, he sees 2 of 3 of mine ;) and is great with them.--their reschedule policy is difficult-- don't cancel appointments!
5	I have been going to Dr. Sowell for 15 years. He and staff are great. Christine has been my hygienist the entire 15 years. Very stable staff. No staff changes/losses that I've seen in the entire time. I highly recommend Dr. Sowell and staff.
