3	This girl working the refreshment counter had no personality and was a little rude.  Plus all the tables are dirty.Mom & I like to stop the refreshment area for some sticks & pizza while shopping this Target...we enjoy these little stops.  But it can be hit or miss with the employees.

1	If I could give 0 stars I would. The customer service is horrible! Especially by the so called manager "Rachel" she is a total rude B! I came to return something (which I had the reciept for) but she kept saying the only way I could get a refund is through a store credit along that she had the worst attitude and kept asking why I was upset. I asked to speak to the manager and she said I am the manager but the way she was talking is in no way professional. Avoid coming to this ghetto target!
