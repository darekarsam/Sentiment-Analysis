5	My name is Bill Ringling and I have worn glasses or contacts since I was 12 years old and I'll be 49 this year. That said, I've never had such a comprehensive exam and I finally found out why my eyes have always been red and dry. My oil glands arent producing!Dr. Steinhauser found my resolution and thats after roughly 25 different exams....my custom glasses were not easy to make (bi focals seamless and using my existing Nike frames glasses properly fitted great vision and were delivered 1 day earlier than promised)State of the art exam equipment and Dr that truly know their stuff.... who could want more?
5	I love Phoenix Eye Care! Within the past year I developed moderate dry eye symptoms and finally received the care I needed here. My dry eye symptoms have reduced significantly after doing the LipiFlow treatment. Also, Dr. Steinhauser did a routine eye exam and found some issues that my other optometrists never noticed. I love how the doctors here always take time to actually figure out my issues and I never feel rushed. They also are super friendly and have a great sense of humor :)
