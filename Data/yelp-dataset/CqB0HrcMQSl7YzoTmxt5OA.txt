4	Ella is a great photographer with a busy schedule. She cares about her work and her business very much. I would be sure to ask tons of questions and get a detailed plan on how the process will work to avoid confusion.
5	How many times can I rave about Ella? Not enough!! Ella and her hubby work together photographing and video recording weddings all over the world! My hubby and I were lucky enough to have 2 wedding ceremonies... Ella did one (the big fancy one) and her company high class studios (photographers that work for her) did the small.  Both were amazing, everyone was there on time, super nice, and had great and creative ideas.  She also does family shoots, newborn and everything in between!!
