3	Well this is a USED car shop. It was busy when we came. It is a family owed lot with husband/wife and a mechanic. We were interested in a BMW they had out front. They let us test drive by ourselves which was great. We ended up liking the vehicle. They did not let us negotiate at all. I am a pretty experienced negotiator and they were not having it. We pretty much purchased the vehicle at full sticker price. The car ran great for a while but then having plenty of problems a couple weeks later including radiator leak, bad window regulator, airbag light came on. Luckly we did purchase a small warranty that will help us with these things to get the car in shape. It is a really nice car and we really like it. They will provide carfax report which is nice. Just dont think you can work these people down, cause like I said they expect to get full sticker price on their vehicles.
5	I've been looking for a mercedes clk 2001-2002 for some time, the one I have recently purchased at this warm and friendly dealership was nothing less than what I had visioned when I saw my self in the car. Well kept, low miles, looking beautiful, and after inspecting it in the mercedes dealership, no mechanical problems. The mercedes rep actually said: you have a winner. That wasn't the first clk I've inspected..Others had major problems that the dealer wasn't even aware of...In short, great place to buy a car from. Fair prices, good customer service, friendly atmosphere, and the best thing - great and well maintained inventory. Well done guys. Keep up.
