3	Ah, Burger King on the base - because there aren't many other options.Stopped here on a few occassions, typically when I'm on base with family. BK is not high on my list of places I like to patron on the regular, but it will do in certain cases.Perks - No tax. Shares dining room with Popeyes. Other customers are nice. Dining room well kept and clean.Cons - Employees seem... A little out of it sometimes? On a recent trip the cheese on my Whopper wasn't even melted. Prep of food could use improvement.Why go? You're on base and it's convenient. But honestly I'd pick getting sandwiches or sushi at the commissary over BK 99.9% of the time.
3	Pretty average BK. It shares a dining room with Popeyes so you'll have decent variety in the building.  The trash cans are always turned facing the walls for some reason, and the fountain drink machines don't always function, but overall it's not much different than any other BK.
3	As far as food quality goes BK is a BK... I have always gotten friendly service here and in the many times I have been there they have never gotten my order wrong, which is what makes it 3 stars when most fast food has to fight for 2 stars from me. My bun has never been crusty and my food has never been cold. It's my go-to stop on overslept school days for a dependably fast breakfast. (No one likes a hungry first grader.)I often stop just for fountain pop (I love fountain pop) and it has never had too much syrup or soda water. The staff does not take offense or act unconvinced by my small order, which is a reaction I have gotten at many other fast food places.Fast food isn't my favorite,  but in a pinch it does the trick. I know I will stop here again. Most likely the next time I hit snooze too many times.
