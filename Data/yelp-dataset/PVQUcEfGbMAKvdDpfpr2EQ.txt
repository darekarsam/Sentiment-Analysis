2	tasty food but the dishes were swimming in a sea of sauce which made it extremely heavy and in a sea of olive oil. i had the pesto pasta which was ok. lots of parmesan and not much basil flavor. snails were better but like other dishes, too much oil. on the plus side: big portion. entrees could be a main on their own
