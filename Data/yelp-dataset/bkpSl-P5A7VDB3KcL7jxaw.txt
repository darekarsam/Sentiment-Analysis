5	This is a wonderful yoga studio. I've taken classes at various studios and gyms and this has been the best overall experience.  The variety of classes is comfortable in size in that it is not crowded.  The owner is respectful, friendly and is open to suggestions.   Harumi, the owner, approaches yoga from a holistic perspective and her style of yoga promotes physical, mental and emotional benefits.  P.F.
5	This studio offers authentic yoga and a wide variety of yoga types and disciplines. Those who are new to yoga or just learning will find a warm welcome and respectful caring inclusion and instruction. If you are an experienced yogi you will find the challenge you require.  I have taken yoga in California and in the northeast US and this is hands down the best yoga studio I have had the good fortune to find.
5	I love this yoga studio because the yoga instruction is individualized and you are made to feel welcome the moment you walk into the studio.   The studio offers so many classes that there is really no excuse that I don't have the time.   The location is perfect for those living in north scottsdale.  I went once and have not stopped it has been a year today.
5	A wonderful respite to practice with others who are like-minded.  The breadth of class offerings is amazing, accommodating both the self and community. The instruction is the best I've encountered.  Very respectful, mind-body nourishment.
