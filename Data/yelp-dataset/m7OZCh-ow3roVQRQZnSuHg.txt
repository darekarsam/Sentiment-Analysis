3	The Lachine waterfront is quite notorious, with the beautiful views, the marina and the line of restaurants/terraces. It does not however have a pub/bar. This is where Bar Trois Devins comes in. Ambiance/decor : Very clean (including bathrooms). It has a heavy, sombre feel, with wooden beams and exposed brick, which is very appropriate. Drinks : What differs them from most bars is that they import beers and stay off the mainstream track. Kudos.Their cocktails aren't decorated like Mardi Gras, but very well mixed and taste good.Service : I was actually impressed on how fast our waiter served us, considering the bar was completely full. (to both bring our orders and when we were ready to check out). PRO : Location. Many enjoy the restaurants on that strip, yet feel that their night is cut short due to regular restaurant hours. It's right next to (walking distance) all the restaurants and is open late.CON : Due to the fact that it's one of the only bars in the area, it can sometimes attract a clientele that may not be right for you. If you are with a small or larger group, this would go unnoticed however.NOTE : This could be an interesting place to rent (as a venue).Reason of 3* rating : I was not blown away, considering Montreal is a bar&restaurant capital, but nothing disappointed me or anyone at my table.
