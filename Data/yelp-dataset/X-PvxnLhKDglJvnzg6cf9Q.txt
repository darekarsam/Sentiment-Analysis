2	The coffee is good. They have lots of varieties to offer. If I was going to rate the place on coffee alone, I would probably give it five stars. Unfortunately there are other things I need to mention.The food I've ordered there has been pretty boring. And my number one complaint... Service. Wow, you can sit there forever waiting for service. They are notoriously under staffed. The poor waitresses are running around completely incapable of keeping up. Maybe Marie & Marie could splurge a little and get another waitress on board.
5	I loved this place.  My sister and I discovered it while we were visiting Montreal on vacation and literally were there everyday that we were in Montreal.  The croissants are yummy and the bowl of cafe au lait is delish.The staff is friendly and doesn't make you feel like a jerk for not speaking French.Really lovely cafe.  I wish I had one just like it at home.
3	The coffee is quite good and flavorful, but overpriced. Service was slow at first but our server was really nice but overworked as some other employees were sitting back and not really doing as much.
