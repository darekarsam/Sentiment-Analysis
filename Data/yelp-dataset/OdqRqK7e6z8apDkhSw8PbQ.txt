4	They stage a car show twice a year at Westworld.  The show spans the entire main tent where the merchandise vendors are located and the lower field and lot area, where all of the cars are on display.  This is an all day deal, so good thing it's held over 3 days.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/good-guys-car-show-scottsdale?select=saHpTPTUiALB9FbK_-OF8Q#saHpTPTUiALB9FbK_-OF8Qhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/good-guys-car-show-scottsdale?select=jqmdBbxjo28_UI-yOQG8rA#jqmdBbxjo28_UI-yOQG8rAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/good-guys-car-show-scottsdale?select=4KkK7_A8T9Df0g1RzZbsfQ#4KkK7_A8T9Df0g1RzZbsfQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/good-guys-car-show-scottsdale?select=nz0wzjkdYud1Pl_Fmu6L4w#nz0wzjkdYud1Pl_Fmu6L4whttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/good-guys-car-show-scottsdale?select=H4JhRfp6OEuXYAO9DKWw3A#H4JhRfp6OEuXYAO9DKWw3AAround the perimeter of the field is where the food vendors and swap meet are located.  The swap meet is a good place to pick up parts & accessories for your car project.Parking can be tough and the walk is long.  Since you'll be on your feet all day long, wear comfy shoes.I can't wait for the next show.Return Factor - 90%
5	Biggest  classic/custom show I've ever been to in Arizona. Between parking and entrance fee it's a little pricey. So much to see that I would have liked to come back for a 2nd day but, not at that price...
5	Just moved here in February from NYC. Had to have two BMWs tinted. Steve and his team are AMAZING! He helped me choose the tint, which highlighted the cars, but did not detract from their beauty. (2014 X6M Space Grey with Red Interior and 2013 M3 Frozen Black). I also had the Paint protection film and radar detectors installed in both cars. These guys love what they do and "excellence" is their mantra. Highly recommended.
