5	The food at this place is amazing. My favorite is the Chicken shawarma! I bring all my friends and family to this restaurant! The staff is friendly and very professional. Very delicious food, don't hesitate to give this place a try!
5	Love this place! The portions are generous but it's not so much food that you feel gross afterwards. You can tell all the vegetables are fresh especially in the tabouli.. The tabouli is my favorite and its satisfying but still light..  If you are looking for authentic Lebanese food in Henderson/7 Hills area I suggest Shawarma Plus forsure.
5	This is easily one of my favorite places to eat at! I love the chicken shawarma wraps! The garlic sauce is AMAZING and the chicken is sliced right in front of you! The fries are always hot and delicious. Also, make sure you try their homemade rose water ice tea, its ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!
5	Finally - a place in Henderson to get great chicken shawarma!!  The prices are reasonable too.
