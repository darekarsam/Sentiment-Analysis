5	Best McDobalds I've ever been to. There fries are always fresh. They have messed up my order only once but they knew right away when I went through the drive thru.  All other McDonalds are ruined for me.

Occasionally you get someone working the window who fails to greet you and seems to be in a bit of a trance. However, the service is generally good and you are "in and out" (drive-thru or inside) in little to no time. All-in-all: Good place to eat with generally good service.
4	Ok, McDonald's is McDonald's but this is my favorite location. It is a little bit smaller then most because it is attached to a gas station, but the play area for the kids is great! The play area is actually about as big as the rest of the place.The people are always friendly and it is always the little things like that which can separate on franchise restaurant location from the other. The other super cool thing was that they were giving out backpacks to the kids as a going back to school promotion. Just something fun that the kids were super excited about. Thanks McD's
