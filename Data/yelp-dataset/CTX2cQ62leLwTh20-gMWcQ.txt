5	When we first started talking about hiring a doula, I wasn't entirely convinced. We decided it was worth trying, and I cannot say what a difference it made in our experience. Erica was there for us every step of the way, and helped us both to remain calm as problems cropped up. I am not sure what we would have done without having her there to settle our nerves and run interference with the Hospital staff. Do yourself a favor and get yourself a doula. It's the best decision we ever made. Erica is spunky but maintains a professional attitude. She goes above and beyond to make your birthing experience exceptional. Because of complications, we were required to go to the hospital 8 times in the last three weeks of my wife's pregnancy...sometimes at 3 in the morning. Erica never ONCE failed to be waiting for us when we arrived. Hire this woman. You will not regret it.

I had an AWFUL experience with my midwife at my home birth and thank God we had hired Erica as my Doula .I really think I wouldn't be here today, nor would my son, had I not had Erica or my husband by my side.  She was so calm,  and has a lot of experience in this business. We love her and can't wait to have her at our next hospital birth. She's an angel!
