4	This branch of the credit union isn't really all the convenient for me on most days, but there are times that I'm out and about when I'll stop in.  Strangely, they have a K-9 unit parked there many afternoons.  I can't say that matters much for most people, I just thought I'd mention it in case it matters to you.Many services are available at this branch, and most days there are 3-4 tellers are available, so even on busy days, the line moves quickly.  There is also an ATM in the outside vestibule and a drive-through ATM in the parking lot, so you have many options.
3	Te coastal credit union doesn't exist anymore, i had lost my credit card from the michigan state fcu and needed to cash a check, the new bank at this location is NOT part of the credit union consortium, and i ran out of gas in my car because they wouldn't cash my check.
