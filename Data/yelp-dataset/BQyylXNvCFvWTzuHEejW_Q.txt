4	Great place to get black and gold gear.  Mostly Steelers clothing but lots of Pirates and Penguins paraphernalia, too.  Many discounted items and plenty of small, inexpensive odds and ends.  Friendly staff, good prices.
3	As a die-hard Baltimore Ravens fan, walking into this store made me cringe with sheer horror.  As a die-hard Baltimore Ravens fan that is married to a die-hard Pittsburgh Steelers fan, however, I felt it necessary to prove my undying love and devotion to my husband by allowing him to drag me... uh, I mean, come into Yinzers to look around at the merchandise.I will say that if you're looking for Steelers paraphernalia (or Pirates, for that matter), this is the place you want to be.  I've never seen so many NFL-licensed items in my life.  Jerseys, shirts, stickers, mugs, keychains, sweatpants - whatever it is, it was slapped with a Steelers logo and sold.  I can't comment on the prices because I was just goggle-eyed looking around the place while my husband's going, "Oh... YEAH, oh YEAH."  I dared to walk into this place with a Baltimore Ravens shirt on my body.  While I thankfully wasn't bum-rushed, I did receive quite a few stares.  (It was expected, heh.)  Kudos to the people of Pittsburgh for not killing me.  :)  This place may not be to my personal taste, but if you're a Steelers fan like my husband is, you'll feel right at home.  Now, if I can just get him to give up that misguided perception... I'm working on it.  :p
