5	I just can't say enough wonderful things about Dr. Graham, his assistant, Steven and Diversified Eyecare Associates in Matthews!  They REALLY do care if you are happy with your glasses.  Please give them a try and I promise you will NOT be disappointed!
5	This was my second appointment with Dr. Graham and the entire staff at Diversified Eyecare are nothing short of spectacular! They are flexible in scheduling and take the time to answer all questions/concerns in a professional manner. Our family will be going to Dr. Graham for years to come!
5	Just to make known, our 1st time visit to Diversified Eyecare Associates was  wonderful. Routine eye checkup and new order for glasses was effortless. Even purchased a additional pair  of reading glasses to go. Good folks,  Steve Kinslow
5	I had such a wonderful first experience at Diversified Eyecare. Dr. Graham and the staff are extremely friendly and knowledgeable. I felt truly taken care of there. Dr. Graham explained things about my eyes that no doctor in over 10 years of eyecare has told me. Steven is passionate about glasses and super helpful when it comes to picking out a new pair. I had trouble choosing just one from their selection! I will happily return and recommend them to family and friends.
