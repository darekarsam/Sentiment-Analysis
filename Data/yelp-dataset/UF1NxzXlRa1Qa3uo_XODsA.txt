4	Even though we had coupons for free burgers and fries and a discount on big Macs at McDonald's, when dad and I saw this Burger King, we decided it was worth paying for food. We ended up giving them a confusing order at the drive-through, but the lady who took our order did a great job sorting everything out.I have to say that the french fries they gave me are the best I've ever tasted... Ever. Did I mention ever?! They were hot, fresh, perfectly crispy on the outside, perfectly salted, and soft on the inside.The frappe that I got was perfect, as was dad's milkshake.The burgers were much better than McDonald's could ever hope for, and better than what we usually get from Burger King. Beingin the poorer part of Phoenix, I expected pretty crappy service and food quality, but the whole experience has been exceptional.My only complaint, is that my Cinnabon was cold when I got it. They should've  heated it up.I would definitely recommend this location to anyone who's nearby. Id even go out of my way for it!
1	Went through drive thru, ordered two 5 piece chicken strips. Drove away, got on freeway headed out of town. As my daughter opened box we discovered they gave us two orders of 10 piece chicken nuggets. How can you confuse an order of 5 with an order of 10.....I had to get off freeway and return them. As soon as she saw me she KNEW why I was there. I never had to say what was wrong.  She did agree to adding a order of fries free of charge.  There is a huge price difference between the two different orders.
2	This is a nice-looking building in a not-so-nice area. They have two Coca Cola Freestyle machines and a self-serve ICEE machine. Looked promising but we didn't see chicken fries on the menu, and never got a chance to ask because we stood there for about 5 minutes and no one bothered to greet us. So we left.
