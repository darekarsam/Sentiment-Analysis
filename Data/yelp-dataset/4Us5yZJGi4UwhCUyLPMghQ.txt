5	I needed to pick up some fuel injection cleaner. While I usually go to AdvanceAuto or PepBoys, I tried the AutoZone (near the Scaleybark lightrail stop). I walked in & it was super clean and well lit. I found the selection of fuel cleaners but was lost when I had to choose. A Service Rep approached me and recommended 'Lucas - tune up in a bottle'. It was about $6.00, the mid price range. And the Rep said it's what he uses after every oil change. I asked how it 'cleans' and he took the time to describe how the fuel system works. Very polite & they didnt try & oversell me on anything else. FYI, That Lucas cleaner worked wonders! It has increased my gas mileage & I'll be using it after I get my oil changed from now on.
5	After a few rainy days' worth of squinting through my smeared windshield, I visited this AutoZone for new wiper blades.  Right next to the Scaleybark light rail stop, it's easy to find and there's ample parking.Well-placed signage directed me to the proper aisle, and the catalogs on hand enabled me to find the blades compatible with my car.  The registers were fully staffed, and my rep rang me up in a snap.What prompts my five-star rating?  Not only did my rep proactively double-check on his computer to make sure I had the correct blades (hey, it never hurts), he also offered to put the new blades on my car.  His courteousness and going the extra mile went a long way.
4	Excellent helpful staff, helped me choose an air filter that can be cleaned and will save me money and windshield wipers and helped me install them in the vehicle.
