3	This liquor store is incredibly convenient if you're going to L'academie restaurant next door.Otherwise it's an incredible inconvenience.  It's a pretty small and narrow store with a decent selection of wines and liquor for its size.  However if you're looking at getting liquor from here for purposes other than for your meal next door, it can get extremely crowded.Good thing though, is the cashiers are all super efficient and the layout of the store makes it easy to funnel in and out.Unfortunately the large line ups that take up the aisles make it a little more difficult to browse for some products.
5	This is a fantastic SAQ. They recently gave this location a serious upgrade. They doubled the size of the store. Let's call it what it is... A giant express SAQ. What more could anyone ask for.
3	So, it's a SAQ, and the booze is there, and it's not one of the tiny ones, and there is a section devoted to the organic wines which I appreciate, so yay and A-OK for sure. This one is on the corner of St Denis and Duluth, so it's very BYO-central and useful and the staff here seems young and laid back and the long lines move quick.
4	Bright, clean, and renovated SAQ with an incredible wine selection on the doorstep of some of Montreal's best BYOB restaurants. Really impressed with this location.
3	We ducked into this SAQ when we were walking around the city, just to browse the selection a bit. They have a fairly extensive selection of alcohol but their prices are ridiculous. With a quick google search, you'll realize that most of their bottles are insanely overpriced. I guess if you're trying to hunt down a particular brand of ice wine or something and needed it for a gift, this would be a convenient place to hit up. Otherwise, I don't see why anyone would purchase alcohol at such unfairly steep prices. It's probably mainly a store for tourists looking for souvenirs.
5	Alcohol close to home = happy Sabrina
