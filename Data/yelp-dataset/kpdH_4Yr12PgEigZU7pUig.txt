4	I've loving this whole deal Edinburgh Leisure has got going on. Granted, it's not the cheapest option for fitness, but what you get is access to NEARLY EVERYTHING. By that, I mean across Edinburgh. Commonwealth Pool I seem to recall is the only exception to this rule. But, if you want classes, rock climbing at Ratho, a game of golf, indoor bowling, gyms, pools, there is a membership that gives you the lot. And I like that, especially as my fat backside really needs to get into shape, stat. What I had struggled with in the past was the, if I sign up to the gym near my work, then I have to trek out at the weekend, but if I do it near my home, well there isn't anything, and it means by the time I get there, I'll be too tired. This way, if I am home, I can nip out to a gym like Portobello (with Turkish baths!), or at work, run into Ratho, or Gracemount, which is a happy halfway point. Gracemount is a pleasant gym, a little rundown, and with one endlessly running tap in the ladies loos (come on, don't tell me you haven't noticed it!). It has a pool (haven't tried it), and a decent sized gym. Seriously, Meadownbank has a gym the size of a cupboard - this is mansion sized in comparison. I've never had a problem getting onto a machine here and I can work away to my hearts content, and if I am near a window, I can watch the pigeons doing what pigeons do, which helps while away the misery of a walking machine.
