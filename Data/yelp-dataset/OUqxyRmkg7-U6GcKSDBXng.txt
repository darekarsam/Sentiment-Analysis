5	You may THINK you have seen diamonds but until you've been to this ultra sleek jewelry store . . . you aint seen nothin. I have never seen diamonds sparkle the way theirs do. They make Tiffany diamonds seem "murky". The staff is phenomenal. They are super helpful, polite and no where near overbearing. I was able to try on anything I wanted and the fabulous older gent that was helping me stored the info of the ring I liked, my size and birthday in the computer just in case woobie wanted to get me a real treat. Their black diamond thin bands are the most gorgeousest (new word) around.
5	James Elliot and his team are the BEST. They listen closely to you -- what you want, what you are looking for, what your budget is. They then show you the incredible items for your collection and if they don't have it for you they will make it for you -- with no obligation from you. If you love what they make great. If not -- no problem. I have lived in many large cities but I have never met a team that is as focused on finding the right piece of jewelry for you and your life.
5	James Elliot is THE MOST WONDERFUL JEWELRY STORE!!!  Their new space is outstanding, and they are SUCH a pleasure to work with.  They have AND create really amazing and unique pieces of jewely.  I showed them a ring I wanted redesigned and they were so helpful about what would  look great with my stones. I was absolutely overjoyed and thrilled with the result!!!  I ended up with a beautiful, one-of-a-kind ring that is truly a piece of artwork.  I JUST LOVE IT!!!  I can't recommend this store highly enough!!!
5	James Elliot is a great jewelry store. Their collection is beautiful and the people are super nice and helpful. Although I only went there to get a diamond ring resized, I was really impressed with the service (and the resizing was very affordable).
