3	Via Veneto was just okay for me. They did have a nice shoe selection, although mostly very expensive. In the center of the store they had a sale section, but I couldn't find anything I would purchase here (a pair of flip flops on sale was still going for $75). The clothing was pretty basic. If you are in the area it may be worth a look, but I don't recommend going here just for this store.
3	My dad and his friends would love this place, but it's not really my style.  They deal in mostly golf type stuff.  Clothes, shoes and accessories which is great, but it's been a while since I've sported such a preppy style.  If that's your thing then go for it, you'll probably enjoy it.
3	When Via Veneto first opened, it was one of the only upscale shoe stores in the city which made it a great place to shop. They tend to stick with classic styles - at times feeling outdated. If you're looking for modern & fashion-forward looks, this is not the place for you. They do carry some cool designers like Frye, Giuseppe Zanotti, Stuart Weitzman and...they have great espadrilles, made in Spain.
4	Via Veneto has certainly made some changes in the past year or so. While their shoe selection has always been upscale and interesting (Frye, Donald Pliner, Kate Spade), they've added some fresher, younger brands to their array of clothing (Joie, Tibi, etc). The store layout is very open and leaves plenty of room to walk about and check out the gorgeous bags, shoes and clothing. Staff has always been very sweet and helpful. While there are plenty of shops to check out in SouthPark, Via Veneto is certainly worth a look if you dig beautiful shoes from all over the world. Bellisima!
