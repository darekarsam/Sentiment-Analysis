5	So happy Eric, Vincent , and Tonya are back! Have been going to Eric for years and does an amazing job! FYI Yelp address is wrong but it sends u to the right shopping center so just look for 702 nail lounge.  Great nails and great prices!
5	This is not my normal spot for my weekly pedicures... But I was in the area and I thought it had to offer something great! I checked on yelp, No reviews... I decided to take a chance. Walked in and was kindly greeted, picked my color and off to the bowl I went. I got the deluxe pedi and I just may be addicted, the hot stones were amazing. I just had back surgery and I'm limited on movement but the tech did everything possible to ensure I was comfortable, this making her job more difficult. I initially was just going to get a pedicure But got additional services. Prices are a bit higher than competitors but the quality and atmosphere are worth it. I'll be back!
5	Amazing service!!! I have not had a great pedicure experience in awhile.  Very clean and neat design- not like a normal salon.  A must see
5	By far the best place I've been! The staff is so friendly and are very personable. Not to mention the decor in the nail lounge is gorgeous! I loved it from the moment I walked in! My guy did exactly what I wanted and my nails came out perfectly! Thank you 702 nail lounge! You'll be seeing a lot more of me! :)
5	702 nail lounge is my new go to spot. Huge selections of colors in gel and polish. The service never feels rushed and the massage with manis and pedis is the best. A few dollars more than I pay at other salons but well worth it. My gel manicure lasted 3 weeks and could have gone longer but my nails were getting too long. This is a great salon!
