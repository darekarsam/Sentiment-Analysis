3	It's a Taco Bell, so let's be real, they can't get more than 3/5 stars. The place was hardly clean for being there late night (the floors needed to be mopped) , but the food was served quickly. So, egh.
2	Its your typical taco bell ...butIf you use the drive thru expect a heavy unpleasant odor..and the few times i've gone..they've gotten my order wrong..or took forever
1	I went here through the drive thru last week and then this week I go for breakfast, and the signs are all taken off and the windows and doors a boarded up. It closed really quickly
