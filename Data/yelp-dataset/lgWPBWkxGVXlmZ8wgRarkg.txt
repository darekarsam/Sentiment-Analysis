4	I haven't ever had a cut at Gordon Wilson hairdressing but I heard about it from a friend of mine who always gets her cut and colour done here which always looks fabulous.I do need my haircut but I always stay loyal to my usual hairdresser who I will definitely need to visit very soon as I'm starting to look like Cousin It. I was told that this salon sold Dermalogica products and seeing as I usually order mine online, I decided to venture in and see what they had on offer. As soon as I was on Salisbury Place I could see the huge selection of Dermalogica displayed in the window. They offer single products in various sizes and also skin packs that are a full cleansing range each targeted for specific skin types. I always go for the sensitive skin kit and was delighted that they had it - it saves me paying the postage charge online! The staff were very friendly and even though I was only in the salon for a short time I could see that it was very fresh and modern and that the staff were very attentive too. They also sell GHD's and I noticed the brand new ones in purple, green, blue and red.
