5	I love trying new things and mixing things up with my work schedule helps keep me engaged. I have found I enjoy martial arts type workouts a lot but it's hard to find a good one near by,So across my groupon feed comes a groupon for Title Boxing. Wasn't into boxing so I ignored it until my friend forwarded me the link and said she bought one. So I read more into it to discover they offered a kickboxing class called "Power hour."  A workout designed to burn up to 1,000 calories in just an hour.I guarantee you I didn't come close to that but I did get an amazing work out in.  The moves are basic that I could keep up with the work out.  The instructor would show variations for those (unlike me) who were more advanced.It was a great setting, and an amazing work out.  I also find that their class schedule is very accommodating for those of us always trying to squeeze a work out in. I would highly recommend this place!
1	The facility is nice clean and the workout is A+, but the customer service is not up to par.  No wonder the facility has a hard time getting memberships.
