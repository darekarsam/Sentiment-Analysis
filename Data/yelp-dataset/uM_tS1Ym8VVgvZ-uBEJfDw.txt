3	There was a bug in my yogurt!! Theh took a look at it and sure enough there was a little critter. They were nice enough to let me get a new one after that. Beware of the fruits!
1	Way too expensive.  My wife and I spent $20.00 for two small yogurts.  Product was acceptable but the cleanliness was questionable.  Flies everywhere.  Management is aware of the problems but feels that it is the customer's issues rather than the business 's problems.  If amount of business is an indication, we were the only customers the entire time we were there and we will not be back.
2	SUMMARY: Overpriced, stingy on samples, bad customer service, and no water!  Using Yogurtland in Chandler as the baseline of what a good yogurt place SHOULD be, let's review:1.  Yogurtland is not afraid to set sample cups out and let you have at it.  Swirls refuses to let you sample it unless the checkout girl personally fills up your sample cup and hands it to you.  2.  Yogurtland has a nice fresh lemon/fruit-infused filtered water with cups sitting out.  Swirls doesn't have ANYTHING to drink, unless you want to buy a bottle of water.  3.  Yogurtland's price is about 2/3 that of Swirls....and Yogurtland has better and more flavors and much better looking toppings.  Ultimately this just becomes another example of how you go to a place because you're in Scottsdale mall, and what could possibly be less than amazing, cool and wonderful inside that place?  Answer:  Anything people are dumb enough to patronize for that reason alone.
5	Swirls is a great rest stop in the middle of your Christmas shopping!! Great location in the food court at Fashion Square...such a friendly staff, and the best yogurt in town!!! A must stop!!!! Highly recommend
