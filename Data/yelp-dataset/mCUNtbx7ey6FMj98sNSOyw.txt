5	Always a great time.  Great prices, great food specials, and Jenn, James, and Sean are some of the best in the business.
5	Great food! We went in about midnight. Not real busy. The bartender waited on us and gave us great service though we didn't get alcoholic drinks. The tea was horrid, but we are Southerners and very picky on our tea. My mom asked for a root beer, and was accidentally given a Dr. Pepper. Other than the drinks (Dr. Pepper was great), it was a nice experience. The food was phenomenal! Had a BBQ chicken sandwich, mom had a burger. I can't believe it was so inexpensive!$20 for food and drinks for two people. 24 hour place. What more can I ask for?
5	Beautiful, friendly staff and excellent service. Food and drinks are great...gaming and pool tables and it's right down the street from my work.  New hangout, not a crazy/dance bar, but a nice place to sit and chat, or even spend some time with yourself in the company of nice, professional servers and bartenders.
