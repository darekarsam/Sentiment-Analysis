4	The lovely tweaker cashier was so funny.. she was grinding her teeth so much that her smile had become rather crooked in her short years. Her hoarse cigarette voice boomed over the customers talking amongst each other as she called for assistance from another cashier. The life of a tweaker can lead you to many places but I have to respect the fact that she was working and contributing to society. In her tweaker way she was quite pleasant to me.. in fact she was far more friendly then the 'buds' over at Best Buy who are to busy comparing their stretched earlobes then to answer a few quick questions. I love tweaker cashier.. she makes me feel like my bottle of water is just a little bit colder then the rest.
4	CHEAPEST GAS IN CENTRAL PHOENIX! The outside area and inside the store may not be as nice as some Circle K's (309 E Osborn is the nicest in central Phoenix), but the gas prices here will beat the other area Circle K's by as much as 10 cents a gallon on regular unleaded.
