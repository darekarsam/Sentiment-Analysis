2	Sometimes I will occasionally venture into this Dollar Store.  It's right next to Fry's so it's very convenient!  It is very small, but I only go here for cleaning supplies so I'm not on the hunt for much more.  It's fairly clean and it's for some odd reason very quiet throughout the store.... For a Dollar Store it's honestly not that bad and it's in a great location.  When I need a new plastic broom I will return here :D
4	Great place to come for gift wrapping, ribbons, cards, etc.  Always find what I need on the cheap at this store.
4	This is a good store. Fairly deep variety. I like to buy a bunch of reasonably priced greating cards. It allows me to already have when I need them. I got 6 congratulations cards for three dollars total. They have good buys on batteries at considerable true savings. It is worth checking out to see if they have a number of true values for you.
