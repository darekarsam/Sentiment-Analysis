5	Mike Jones is a great artist.  He touched up my tat that I was not  happy with.  Now it is beautiful.  Mike free handed the add on work.  Want a touch up cover up or just an awesome tat.  Go see Mike Jones.  I suggest making an appt if you can so the artist in prepared for you.  But they do wait for walk ins as well.  I was one of them.  THANK YOU MIKE JONES.  He will make you enjoy your visit too.  Funny guy.    While I was there Ashley also did 3 piercing another great person.  Gentle and she talked you through it.  Very professional group of people but fun as well.  I'm going back for another touch up by Mike them I'm going to ask him to help me create one bad azz tat.
5	Great spot. Mike jones is a great artist. The shop is full of people with great customer service skills. Most tattoo shops are not. 5 stars for sure .
5	I went to Shannon to have a small teacup wrist tattoo done. She did a wonderful job. With the different things I wanted to incorporate into my idea, she was able to put all of them in and also add her personal touch, which was perfect.  I love the fact that it is vintage/feminine all in one. Thank you Shannon.
1	I had a tattoo cover up done at the shop in aj and it was not finished I didn't pick my colors my cover up isn't even covered he left parts untouched looks like shit very unhappy And upset I spent the money on the cover up When I could have just went and got it removed instead I would rate it with no stars but it made me click one so it would post lol
