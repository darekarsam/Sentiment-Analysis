5	What can we say about this little nestled GNC store?  Let's see...Nathan was VERY helpful and extremely knowledgeable about the products within the store and was able to help me get what I wanted and get me out the door quickly so I could head to my workout. He suggested these awesome little appetite suppressant/ energy boosters that I love! Lychee Mango something or another, they have a bowl at the checkout so you can take one a try for free.  They don't last more than 6 hours for me, but during those  hours- they are GRRRRRRRRRRREAT! I had to go back and Nathan was there again and helped me out just as quickly as last time.  People like that REALLY make a store, especially when you know nothing about what you are buying and count on a good solid opinion!
5	Went into this store having absolutely no clue what all I needed. I have started Insanity and wanted to maximize my progress with all the supplements I needed. Nathan also helped me out, like the last reviewer. I was highly impressed with how much he knew! You could tell he works out frequently and probably takes all the same supplements that he recommended to me. He also explained each supplement, what they are, and how they work. He put it into laymans perspective so a newbie like me could understand. This store also had a huge selection of things to choose from, and different brands and prices of each product. I think Nathan hooked me up with the best deals they carried to help me have a longer supply with as small of a cost as possible. I definitely recommend this store to anybody, knowledgable or not about the products they carry.
