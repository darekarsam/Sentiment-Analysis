2	I got a good deal on a Google offer so I decided to try this place out.  The car wash itself is a little old.  Service was friendly, and they did hand wipe down my car.  However they didn't get off all the bird poop I had on my car, and some other dirt on my tires.  Also when I was paying the guy on the right side started spraying water when my window was open.  A little water got into my car, he could have waited!  It only took 2-3 minutes to pay.  Overall it's an OK car wash.  Prices are high if you don't have an good coupon.
3	I can't speak to the car wash, but Brian did a great job detailing my car!  After  my paint job had an unfortunate altercation with some concrete dust and paper towels (not by me), Brian was able to buff and polish out the myriad of tiny finish scratches.  I dropped it off and it was done a few hours later, looking fantastic!  Price was about average.
4	Just stopped in for a car wash and they did a great job. They even gave me a card for a future discount. I will definitely be returning.
