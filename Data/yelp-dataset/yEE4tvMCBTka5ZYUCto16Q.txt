3	The food was good, it is a step above most Italian restaurant in the West Island, and so is the price.  But it's worth sometime it I think.  They have private wine selection. We had a nice red from a small Italian producer that was very good for $55.  Note of caution, Friday nights hosts a tenor that sings about anything.  He his very good but the place is not big enough for such loud entertainment.  You have almost no choice but to listen as it impossible to have a conversation around the table, and he is on for most of the evening.  I almost lost my voice by the end of the evening, shouting to  my friend sitting next to me.  I think the staff was also annoyed by the show and it was reflected in the somewhat slow and clunky service.  This nonetheless seemed to please some of the other guests, which danced and sang along.  Very much an "older crowd".I probably will go back again but not on Friday
4	A small, elegant and pricey Italian place in a surprising strip mall location. My work associates and I came here on a quiet weeknight with good appetites, and we were not disappointed.The menu was simple but had lots of good choices, plus there were four or five specials that night. I chose the red snapper special, and it was excellent, large, and perfectly cooked.  A delicious bottle of light chianti for the table, and we were set.Ambiance was very pleasant: Red curtains on one wall, birch branches in vases, elegant photos and prints surrounded us. The service was also excellent and attentive. I'll make an effort to return if I'm in the area again.
5	Some friends and I from work had dinner mid week. I had my 3 year old son with me. This was one of those rare occasions when it was hard to tell what was better the food or the service. Great wines, amazing entrees. Just a fantastic evening.
