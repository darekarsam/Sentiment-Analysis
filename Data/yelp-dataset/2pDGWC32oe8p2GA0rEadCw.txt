5	What a great experience we had! Will for sure use them again! Professional and nice, very reasonable price with no hidden fees and it was no problem that I ordered a bounce house only 4 days before I needed it!
5	GREAT COMPANY! Very professional, very clean and was on time. I will be calling Chipmunk Bounce Houses for all our future family events.
5	Had the 13x13 castle bounce house for my daughters 5th bday party. Comfortably fit 11 children, ten kids were ages 1-7 and there was one 11 year old. (Who enjoyed it just as much) I actually came across this company by luck, I had already had an arrangement with another company for a house and they called me the DAY BEFORE the party to let me know they couldn't do it! Ughhh I was pretty upset. So I searched and searched the internet calling all the bounce house places but no one was able to do it with a days notice :-( I ended up getting Chipmunks number from another bounce house company who recommend I contact them as they were unable to meet my request. I called them right away and sure enough they were able to do it!! With a day notice! They saved my party! Very thankful. A guy named Jason delivered and picked up the bounce house. He was unbelievably sweet and very understanding with my girls who just couldn't wait to get into the bounce house. Set up and break down time was pretty fast too. Overall super happy with service! Would recommend!
