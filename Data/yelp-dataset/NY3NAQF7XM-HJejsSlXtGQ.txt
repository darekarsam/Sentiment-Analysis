5	We called this company out for a potential bat problem at our home.  The owner is first-rate and I would highly recommend this company to anyone.
5	This company is worth your trust and your dollars. I used them to trap and humanely relocate a family of tree squirrels that decided my 70 foot pine tree wasn't good enough anymore and moved into my attic. Not good. So, Critter Control to the rescue! All 4 critters captured in 24 hours, relocated as a family, and we are at peace since they also fixed up the entry points on the house. Kristen in the office, you're amazing, girl, thanks for the responsiveness. Trapper Casey, well done my man! And you even braved the attic repair on a 120 degree forecasted day! Simply professional service and highly efficient.No ripoff attempts, expert knowledge in their field, superior equipment.Well done guys, well done!JR ParrowScottsdale
5	From the moment that I called their office Kristen was very knowledgable and took the time to troubleshoot our issue. Our the field rep had great follow-up and was genuinely concerned to solve our critter problem. He even told us when we didn't need to pursue a project that another rodent advisor tried to steer us towards. Thanks for your honesty. We will continue to give your company our business!
