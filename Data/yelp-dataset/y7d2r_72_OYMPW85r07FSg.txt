5	They were fantastic! Got stranded in Phoenix on Saturday and needed to have clothes ready by Monday morning to wear to work. All other dry cleaners in the area were not able to clean clothes on a Saturday.  The owner here said he could clean one outfit that day and then get me the rest on Monday, which would have been amazing by itself.  But instead, he did all of my clothes (4 outfits) on Saturday, and then, when he thought I wasn't going to arrive to pick them up before he closed (knowing that I would need them to wear Monday morning), he drove to my hotel to drop them off.  Fantastic service!
2	...I need a washer and dryer.  Badly.  This place just confirmed something I already knew.
2	Pretty standard crappy laundromat.  About half of the machines are broken, most annoyingly ALL of the double load machines which are the most cost effective for my laundry needs.  AC is marginal, and I am actually pretty sweaty in here.  The driers seem to work well and are pretty cheap
3	I recommend getting a quote on wash and dry services before coming here, explain exactly what needs to be cleaned and pay up front.
