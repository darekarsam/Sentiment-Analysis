1	Also goes under the name Widow's Extreme Machines.  Contact the BBB before you send any business to this shop.  The owner is the most dishonest and inconsiderate individual, ever encountered. They do not even deserve one star but it was necessary in order to post this.
5	Very easy to work with. Imaginative and Friendly guys to help you get what you want out of your muscle car. Widow works with you to create a plan to get what you want out of your dream car. I had used a couple other shops around town for my 1968 Camaro RS/SS and Widow Industries was a great find.
5	This is a place where u can have a vision of something and these guys will make it happen custom to the fullest or just your everyday car care need these guys make it happen.
