1	I don't care how busy your day is or how tired you are... this is a store. It is totally unprofessional to lie across the checkstand as if you can't stand up, lazing around throughout the entire transaction and finishing up by laying your hand across the receipt printer and weakly muttering the word "here".I've seen better days at this location.
