5	Do you follow Miss Daisy on Instagram?? Because you should... the arrangements are the most original, vibrant, creative and beautiful you could possibly imagine. The next time I need flowers for an event, I'm calling her.I also got a flower crown from her at the Life is Beautiful festival in Vegas - it was so stunning and lasted a few days after the festival. Magic!!!! :)
5	Not only are Miss Daisy's arrangements beautiful, fresh, and inventive, but her enthusiastic personality will make you want her help with everything!  Every arrangement I see is not like any other place I can reach out to, so I know I'm getting my bang for my buck!!If you are in Vegas, you MUST contact Miss Daisy for an event because she will do whatever you need and her fun personality will make you want to be her best friend at the end of it!!

She made me an arrangement for mother's day and it was not only gorgeous- but the flowers LASTED for over a week! High quality and she worked around a tight schedule to make us happy. Thanks!!!
