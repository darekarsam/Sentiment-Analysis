4	Hole in the wall with excellent food.  Been at this location for years.  BBQ beef ribs, fried chicken, collard greens mac-n-cheese, corn bread and sweet tea.  These are the items I always get.  This is a cafeteria sytle set up.

1	Floyds on Nation Ford rd is terrible!!!! Worst collards and macoroni and whatever in the world. And space. Taste like noodles, salt, and water. No milk or cheese. Not made with love. Food made with HATE. Im so sorry the owner died. Should have taken this so called restaurant with him. I should have known the food was gonna be bad because of the bad service!!! Floyds food does not taste nearly as good as mine. Reply to my post and i will sell a real recipe for collards and real macaroni and cheese. Oh, the location milton road food excellent!! Holla at me or them to learn how to cook!!!
