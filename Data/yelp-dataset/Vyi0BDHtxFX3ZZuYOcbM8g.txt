5	What a lifesaver! Can't tell you how pleased we are with Jonathan's skill and expertise in flushing out the five foot female diamondback who had taken up residence under our house. His efficient and humane handling of the situation, as well as advice on preventing future problems, was outstanding. Would give them ten stars if we could.
