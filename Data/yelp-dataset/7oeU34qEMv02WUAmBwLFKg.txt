5	Formerly Coupe Bizzarre, this my place has changed ownership and name in 2013. I have been going there since 2009 for haircuts and I love it! My regular stylist is Olivier, he just seems to be able to read my mind and my hair always ends up looking amazing with him. I also got good haircuts there from Amy, Megan, Sarah, and Ben, and one haircut with Yannick which turned out to be a bit too edgy to my liking.All the stylists there are talented and friendly, and it's a good place whether you're looking for classic cuts or edgy ones. Not cheap (around 50-60$ for a cut, over 120$ for highlights), but totally worth the money in my opinion!
5	Very friendly, unpretentious, non-corporate vibe. Excellent service, talented staff, excellent music choices in a bright, light cheerful but uncluttered space. They also use and sell sulfate-free products. Open 7 days a week and are often very flexible about scheduling cut and colour.
5	Love this place.  I get a haircut about once a year.  Last year I walked in off the street and Caroline was available, she took me right away.  I have really thick long straight hair.  I told her I never wear it down because it gets so big, especially in the winter with all the humidity/temperature changes between indoors and outdoors.  She found a way to keep it long but take off a lot of volume underneath without making it look too layered. I loved it.  Went back today after ~ 14 months and she remembered me and gave me the same cut, equally excellent to the first time.  The whole vibe is cool in there, feels like people I would like to hang out with, and the chit chat is interesting instead of the normal trite salon chat.
