3	I really like this place the food is good for the price. the service is good since most times the waitress is also the cook.
4	This is an excellent Mexican restaurant, very authentic. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The restaurant goes under the name El Rodeo and is connected to the market - great meat market by the way. There can be a language issue at time (I cannot really speak Spanish) but we got it worked out and had some great food.For really good and inexpensive Mexican food, visit El Rodeo.
4	The prices! The Service! The Cleanliness! The Friendly Staff! I can't put enough roses on their shoulders! I don't bother shopping anywhere else,even my sister who travels from Homewood shops at Ramirez Market.
