5	Empire Theatre Kitchener Studio 12 Gateway Park is the best movie theatre in the City of Kitchener.  Yves, the Manager, and his team run a efficient, comfortable, clean and enjoyable theatre experience.Even when the place is absolutely packed with moviegoers at the holiday season, this Empire Theatre location keeps everything humming smoothly.  With the latest renovations complete, this facility has the latest state-of-the-art digital projection capabilities, as well as a new IMAX experience.The theatre is located in a big box development close to the 401 with East Side Marios and Chapters with Starbucks.  There is lots of free parking available to make your theatre-going even more convenient.
3	Just saw Interstellar (IMAX) at this theatre and I had a problem I've never encountered in going to the movies:  the sound was overly loud and blown out during action scenes and I missed a lot of the dialogue as a result. I changed seats to the back of the theatre, which improved things, but it was still noticeable. Should be a non issue for the sound to be properly dialed in for $16 a ticket.
