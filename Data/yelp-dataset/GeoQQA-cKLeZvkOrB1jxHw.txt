5	Claire gives the best massage in the valley. She's professional and very good at what she does. I recommend her to everyone. I love her new location, too!
5	My mom and I had skinny wraps and facials by Claire.  We both had a wonderful experience and would definitely do it again.  Claire was super personable and was full of great information that really made our experience fantastic!  We would both definitely recommend her services!!
5	I had a deep tissue body massage and it was really awesomee!!! Claire is really good at this and I will recommend this place to evryone. I had a great time and feel completely relaxed. Also Claire gave me good tips and advice for my sore muscles..looking forward for my next session with her :)
5	Claire is an amazing massage therapist.  I have referred a number of friends to her and when I have friends visit me in Arizona, I always book a session for them as well.   I would highly recommend her and her service at Fireside is so convenient.  Michelle Schooff
5	Claire and the Hands in Motion team is the best there is.  I have monthly appointments and one of the few that can actually make my lower back feel better.  Claire's massage is like Dominick's Steakhouse always perfectly done, everytime!
