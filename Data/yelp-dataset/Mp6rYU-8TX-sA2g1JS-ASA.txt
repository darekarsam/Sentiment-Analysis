3	Very laid back atmosphere.. Interesting (if limited) selection of organic sproutlings in the spring-- the jalapeno plant I got from these guys is producing an awesome amount of peppers. Prices on the soil, fertilizers, and additives stocked here are higher than Home Depot, but worth it, as they are trusted, organic producers making high quality stuffs. A selection of hydroponic gear is here if that's your bag. I'm a novice at growing things, so I've brought afflicted planties and vegetables here in a panic, had the problem diagnosed, bought a suggested product, and watched the problem fix itself, thanks to whatever magic serum I ended up purchasing--They know what they're talking about without being know-it-alls. Only issues would be a smallish inventory of (like I said) plants in stock, and less selection of garden essentials with multiple price options. I ended up going down the street even though I'd much rather give these guys my cash, but wasn't going to spend $26 on a watering can.
