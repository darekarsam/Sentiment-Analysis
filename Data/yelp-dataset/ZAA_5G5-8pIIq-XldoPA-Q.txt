5	This studio is tops!  This gal is so awesome!   When I leave her studio, I feel like I've taken a tranquilizer.    Her knowledge of skincare and her professionalism is fantastic.I have had a facial, dermaplaining and a peal.     I'd totally recommend this studio to anyone.   I've given my daughter a gift certificate to Lavender Skin Care and she was impressed.    It would be a great Christmas gift.
5	What a relaxing treat my facial was with Elizabeth! She knows her business well...very professional and caring....overextends herself to care for my specific skincare needs. New location is gorgeous!
