5	I'm a horrible person for not writing this review sooner, because these guys rock. First off, I got my inspection done when they were playing with their new toy - a thermal imager to detect heat/insulation problems, so they threw the information from that into my report gratis. Secondly, their report was very detailed and extremely professional. They answered all the questions I had as a newbie homebuyer and were very patient with my lack of knowledge. All issues discovered during inspection were sorted into severity levels I could understand, and well organized.Third, due to problems with the seller's contractors, these guys kept having to come back to re-inspect the house, once well into the evening. They didn't charge me much for the re-inspection, and were just as thorough in pointing out deficiencies / things that may become problems.
1	This is the rudest company I have ever delt with. If you call Tom to ask a question contrary to his report he interrupts you and starts yelling at you. He out and out lied to me. They damaged my mothers home she is a senior citizen on a tight budget. They  put incorrect information in there report. I could not even talk to him as he kept yelling at me. I recommened you warn others about his temper
5	As a Realtor I have worked with several inspection companies.  I feel very confident, whenever Cornerstone is involved, that they will do a detailed inspection and point out problems that are there now, as well as items that could cause a potential problem in the future.  They are patient with both buyers and sellers and will go over the entire report and answer questions for those of us who don't know about building codes and potential hazards.  They also categorize items so it is easy to see if this is something to note, or something normal to the aging process of a home.  They are professional and a first rate company in my book!!
