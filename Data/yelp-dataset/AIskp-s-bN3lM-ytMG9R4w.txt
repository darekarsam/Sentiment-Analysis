5	I've been vaping for a couple of years, and it was time to upgrade to the latest. I wanted something that would do the job, but also add a bit of stealth to it. Most people who vape go for the larger, bulkier, bad-ass-look-at-me-I'm-vaping sized but I wanted something stealthy, pocket sized and could still do the job as the big boys.  On a Saturday morning, I head down and the sales man wasn't pushy, explained every concern and question and was very friendly. Getting a free coffee helped as well. All the models were shown and demonstrated. You're able to try different flavors, the list is easily understandable and most importantly, unlike the vape shop I normally go to, on St. Denis, they actually addressed my concerns and helped me pick an e-cig that balanced power, durability and stealth. If you're starting out or a pro, this shop didn't disappoint. And, they apparently make their own e-juice themselves. A full kit and 2 e-juices for under 40$? That's a win for me.
5	Checked this place out on a whim while visiting Montreal this weekend. Tasted just about every flavor, and every single one was delicious. We ended up buying way more than we ever intended, but were happy to do so because the prices are reasonable relative to the really excellent quality. The staff was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. I wish there was a store like this in my city!
5	Finally, a shop in Canada that caters a to the "advanced" user! After visiting three or four shops, looking for someone to rebuild my atomizer without any luck, these guys came through. I ended up spending a few hours at the shop discussing diff technologies, juices, etc. they make their juices in house and creating new ones. Super chill. Reasonable prices. Go.
