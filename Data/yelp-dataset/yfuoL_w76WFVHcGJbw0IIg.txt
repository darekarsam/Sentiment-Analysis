2	Although I've never had any of their other menu items except their gyro, I wish I would have gone elsewhere. Since I can only comment on their gyro; here goes... First, the meat is embroiled with fatty particles (it's fake meat or something), second; they don't include enough dressing, third; there are way, way too many onions, forth; there were only two very small slices of tomatoe, fifth; the feta cheese is not crumbled but in a patty, sixth; they just pile the stuff on top of a pita, - to be quite honest, it just tastes bad.
1	Nick's used to be good with the previous owner, that all changed. Which is pretty sad.
4	Nick's has legit New York Style pizza.  It's dirt cheap too!
4	Stopped here after a wedding and it was delicious!  My mom had the blt hoagie, she said it was the best blt she's ever had.  The bacon was crispy and not greasy, perfect amount of tomato, lettuce, and mayo.  I had the gyro.  The meat was perfect and it was a very large portion.  My sister had the fried zucchini and popcorn shrimp and fries.  Everything was perfectly cooked and delicious.  Plus reasonably priced.  We'll def go there again.
5	Best gyro you will ever have in your life. They really give you a ton of meat. You basically get two gyros for the price of one that's how big it is. It tastes simply amazing. The fries are average, but the gyro is to die for. Pizza is decent here too.
3	The gyro wedgie is my go-to menu item, and it's awesome,  but I've also had their pizza, and for the price, it's just alright.  I would have rated them higher, but sometimes they just don't answer the phone during their posted business hours.  This led me to try other pizza places in the neighborhood, and I saw what I as missing. If you want a gyro wedgie, don't go anywhere else,  but if its just pizza your looking for, I highly recommend going elsewhere (Doughboys, DiPietro's, or Cerasoli's...just to name a few).
