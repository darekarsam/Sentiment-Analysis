3	This is a typical comfort food restaurant. The service was alright, though I wish they refill my water more than once.I ordered the club sandwich, the chicken was very dry and the taste was mediocre.All that being said, it is still a place I enjoy as the prices aren't very high and the portions were very large.
2	The pizza is a classic. Had it many times over the years and will still order it. Almost as good as Como Pizzeria.Last night however, we decided to try something new. BAD idea!The veal piccata was no better than the rubber soles of my shoes, the spaghetti bolognese was over cooked pasta with a fad brown sauce that tasted old and like it came from a can, full of preservatives and thickeners. My hubby's "scampies" we're actually tiny, well overcooked shrimp, spread open and heavily breaded with an oily garlic butter served in a cardboard cup. His food was served 5 minutes after mine and was cold.If you stick to the pizza you'll be fine. But if you feel like eating Italian, this is not the place.
