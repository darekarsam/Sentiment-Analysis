5	Love this place! The pies are delicious and you can choose between hot, ready-to-eat pies, pies to go, or even frozen pies. Prices are reasonable, pies are filled with yummy goodness and just ask to know more about anything you are uncertain of.The first pie I ordered from here was the Ned Kelly which is an awesome pie stuffed with beef, bacon, gravy, boiled eggs, and every other artery clogging ingredient you can think of! Mind-bogglingly good, make sure to have a spot to lay down after consuming this one!
5	Delicious! A bit spendy, but a worthwhile treat! I'll be back again, I want to try them all. Pastry layered to perfection.
4	I now know what an Australian Pie is and what it is not. To my disappointment, these pies are not dessert pies; nevertheless, they are tasty savoury meat pies. The guy running the place was really nice and helpful. There is a nice little place to eat outside too! I would go back sometime.
5	Delicious pies and nice helpful people at the counter.  Perfect food for a little indulgence on the go.  Tasted the butter chicken pie and also the traditional.  Both were great.  I like and will go back.
5	This restaurant makes the best meat pies ever! I am really sad that this location has closed.
