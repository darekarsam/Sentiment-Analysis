2	I have been to a couple different City Tavern locatations and had the exact same experience. The food is not good at all, and is completely over priced. I've had their crab leg special and crab cakes and wasn't impressed at all. I would only return to get drinks, and because the City Tavern by where I live has great outdoor seating.
4	I have been here a few tomes but only for lunch.  I have always had the chicken panzanella, and it is quite yummmy.  Also at lunch the prices are really reasonable   I think at night time this place is yup city, but they do have a wonderful outdoor patio on top of the restaurant that's cool.
3	Yeah, they're closed.  Shock of the century.  Overpriced drinks and a pretentious menu that didn't live up to its vision.  For this neighborhood in general it was too ambitious.  The same restaurant downtown probably would have soared because Uptowners tend to ignore prices more.  But in Dilworth it's trying too hard.  Just be a pub!  People love pubs!
