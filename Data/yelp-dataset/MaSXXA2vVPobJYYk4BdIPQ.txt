4	Ok, to be up front, I used to work here a little while ago, when they were located in the centre d'achat. Since I have moved, they moved to the old Dunkin' Donuts location, just across the parking lot. So it's been almost a year since my last visit, and I've been twice in the span of a week, since I am visiting my family. Maybe I am biased or sentimental, but this is still a Starbucks that is friendly and has great drinks! The old location was a bit cozier, but this new one has more natural light. They also have a drive-through now, which is convenient if you're really in a hurry.
