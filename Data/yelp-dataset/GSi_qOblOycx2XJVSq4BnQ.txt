5	Nice, helpful Staff! I went in last month;  the place was still under construction!  (Literally,  there was a Guy laying Tile!). There were 2-3 customers ahead of me & it did take a bit to get service,  but when it was MY turn,  it WAS MY TURN! The guy, literally acted as if no one else was in the Shop! He taught me how to use my "starter kit" & invited me back with ANY questions/concerns! I haven't had ANY problems & I will DEFINITELY be going back!
2	Not impressed with this place or the guy behind the counter. I asked him what brand of  oil did not contain distilled water. He said "probably the organic one because it doesn't have any chemicals" (Apparently distilled water is a chemical now). So I checked out a bottle of the "organic" oil and first thing I see on the label is the California cancer causing chemicals warning. First ingredient listed: distilled water.  Ehh...I bought some anyway and it was awful.
5	The guy was really helpful. Recommended very tasty liquids you have to try the MISFIT it tastes exactly like Trix cereal :)
5	D.j helped me out, really nice guy. He drilled my tugboat RDA so cleanly. They have a large selection of juices and drip tips. Since they do free drilling I ended giving him a $3 tip.
5	Always fantastic to come here. D.J. and Mark are always amazing and help in any way they can. Love this place! Juice selection is of decent size and hoping that they will carry more soon.
