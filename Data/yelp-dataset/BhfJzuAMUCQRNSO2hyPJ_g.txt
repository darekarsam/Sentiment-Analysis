5	Dear Sun Valley Bakery,You have a special place in my heart (and stomach). I don't even have to tell you because you already know. My constant trips arise from not being able to stay awake for over a week. "Bakery", yes you are. But you also serve an entire menu of DELICIOUS Vietnamese food that surpasses any other in the valley. Yes, I know that is bold of me to say, even on Yelp for everyone to hear, but it is the truth. Everyone, this little diamond in the rut is a wonderful little treasure nestled in the tiny corner of an almost hidden shopping center. This officially serves THE BEST BOBA I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. Pho and Boba crazed as I am, this sweet spot is a gem in Phoenix that I am blessed to have come accross. I urge all fellow pho and boba addicts to swing by and see for yourself. The place is tiny, the shopping center is a bit run down, but if it is amazing pho and the best boba in the state you seek then that you will find. The lady that is always there is such a sweetheart as well and is always happy to see people enter this tiny, happy and special place. Oh yeah, the super low prices don't hurt either. :)

I've had the pho, the rice soup (chao bo), and the steam buns.... all were fantastic!  the location is a bit sketchy but don't let that deter you.  The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly and the food is awesome.  Go have a great meal and take some steam buns home for later, you won't regret it.
5	Nom Nom! Awesome Pho and Spring Rolls! Prices are great and staff is super friendly! Stop and try if you're a Pho fanatic like me =)
