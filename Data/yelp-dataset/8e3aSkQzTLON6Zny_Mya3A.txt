3	I do my business banking here and find it to be more pleasant than the average bank. The staff is plentiful and cheerful. They have a sort-of middle person who approaches you as you enter to help direct you to the right place - it often seems like overkill, maybe a little patronizing, but I am sure lots of people enter banks not knowing exactly what to do or who to see. It even has character, such as the security guard who loafs around, cracks jokes and participates in what seems to be a mandatory friendly greeting policy within this branch. They also keep a water bowl out front for thirsty critters. Now if only they handed out glasses of wine to customers...On my last visit, I had to leave a message for a specific employee who was working out of a different branch that day; he called me within the hour! The same person has previously made it clear that it's ok to call his cell, even on the weekend while he was out golfing. I do not like to support the golf habits of bankers, nor do I agree with many of the policies of big banks, but this particular branch glosses over all that bad stuff with admirable expertise.
4	This branch was my home branch when I lived in Shadyside. The staff were always friendly, possibly too friendly, and as Heidi said maybe a bit overbearing- but I always felt they were genuine and generally seemed happy to be there and help anyone who walked in. I travel out of the country a lot for work and they always worked closely with me about making sure to keep adrift of my travel plans. Everything always went efficiently there, even the drive through- although it was oriented very oddly and getting in and out of the parking lot was never fun.
