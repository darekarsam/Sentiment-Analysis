3	Nice enough folks, no street bikes or street gear, so if that is your genre skip this place.  On the other hand, if you are into motocross and 4 wheelers, you will find plenty to choose from.
5	Great gang, their off road knowledge and selection for either 2 or 4 wheel fans is second to none!  By far the best KTM selection in the Valley.
5	I was in the market for a 2014 KTM 1190R Adventure and met Geoff at the KTM demo ride earlier in the year. I also met several other dealers there that are in the Phoenix area but MotoCity stood out in my book. I have been around motorcycles my entire life. I like how Geoff went out of his way (California) to find me the 1190 R. He mentioned he would take care of me and he did just that. I also like the fact that MotoCity are true racing enthusiasts and help local riders. Great group of people who really care and love what they do.  Thanks  Joe Bacal
5	Great shop and friendly staff. Bought my first brand new dirt bike from them. They made the process so easy and stress free. Easiest 10 grand I have ever spent haha.  Great shop if you are a racer or just a weekend warrior. Thanks Geoff and the staff at Motocity.
5	Great company, great people and great service. I have bought 5 bike from them and I have been nothing but extremely pleased!!!
