5	There is nothing like a fresh from the oven pizza with melted cheese and my favorite toppings! The quality and freshness is consistent and I love the dessert pizzas, too! MC
5	Couldn't get enough of the new Angus Steak & Garlic pizza. It was a meal with all the fresh vegetables and meat. I highly recommend it.
3	No Yellow Cheese!! Keep it off, is convenient easy to bake & eat fresh, just don't add yellow cheese. Pizza should have the right type of cheese, melted not chewy.
