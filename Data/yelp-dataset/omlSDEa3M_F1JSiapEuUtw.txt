2	A quick trim and she did an okay job, but I had the impression that my stylist would have preferred to be taking a break instead of cutting my hair. I'll get another stylist next time.They have an app so that you can check in when you're on the way, so you don't have to wait.
2	Returned for another cut and at least this time, the stylist was able to hold a conversation while sharp implements were whizzing past my head. All good.I noticed later that my credit card had been charged $20. Is a $7 tip appropriate on a $13 cut or does the $15 at the bottom of the slip make more sense? Anyway, I'm done with this Great Clips. I will not return.
3	First time here at great clips here. I walked in had no wait time which was great. The hair cut was fast but the whole time was awkwardly silent. For a last min hair cut it was great, though I just needed a fade. But could be alil more customer friendly...maybe smile? But it was a good cut and she shaped me up as well and trims, much better then sports clips at river gate! $13 +$3 tip I was pretty satisfied, where as sports clips I was charged $28......
1	Won't be going back....my sister who usually cuts my hair saw how bad of a job it was. A hair person herself, pointed out the simple little things.....won't be going back plain n simple.
5	Close to my house, friendly women, my regular Stylist are always available whenever I arrive, great fades, great price, I'm a regular here now and I will  keep coming back! :)
