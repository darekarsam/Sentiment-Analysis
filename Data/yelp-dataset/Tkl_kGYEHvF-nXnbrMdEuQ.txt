5	I adooooooooore Ivory and Willow!!!  It is the most haven-like of havens for a vintage decor and interior design-aholic like myself!!  Ivory and Willow stocks everything from mirrors to bedding, to cards and gifts to four poster beds and it doesn't maintain a ridiculous price tag to boot!  You would be forgiven for thinking that Ivory and Willow might be a tad on the pricey side, merely because everything it sells is so luxurious!As if that wasn't enough, built into the back of the store is a fabric stall providing numerous different styles and patterns to go with all your lovely new Ivory and Willow purchases!As for the decor of the store itself, I couldn't possibly tell you, as it's so jampacked with lovely things for us to buy!  And if you tire in your pursuit of loveliness, there's the instore cafe fro you to rest your tootsies in, complete with outdoor picnic tables!  I wound't go anywhere else when on an interior design spree, Ivory and Willow is phenomenal!
4	The coffee shop is a bit on the dark side, which isn't helped by the dark wooden furniture and flooring.   Thankfully, they got rid of the plasma tv that played dance music...  Totally inappropriate for the demographic that visit.That said, their cappuccino is the best in Corstorphine, and much much better than you'd get in many other places.It's a shame that Wetherspoons along the road are selling their coffee at almost half the price.
