4	Finally, a bulk food store in Montreal that really does offer food in bulk (and not just prepackaged in store-branded packaging). I believe that this store has opened recently -- at least, it's the first time I've noticed it.This storefront on Jean-Talon backs onto the Jean-Talon market (near the oysters) and has a wide selection of spices, nuts, snacks, baking ingredients, coffee and tea (including lovely flowering teas), candy, candy and more candy, and, for some reason, stuffed animals. They seem to make their own candy in a workshop off to the side and up a step. I'll be coming here often to refill my spices, powdered soup base, Dutch-process cocoa, shredded coconut, ...
5	Ouvert depuis 2 mois seulement, j'espere qu'il est la pour rester! J'adore ce genre de magasin ou tout est en vrac et tu peux acheter un peu de plein de choses :-)Bonbons, chocolat, epices, farine, pates, riz, poudre a soupe, the, cafe, etc! Et ce n'est pas le choix qui manque. Il y a une petites section toutous? Ca j'ai pas compris! Parfait si on veut faire un cadeau ou se gater soi-meme avec un peu de tout!
4	i love bulk store!this one ain't bad at all. they have a wide range of stuff including plushies for the kids or those still young at heart. its not the best bulk store in town as certain things are pricier if you shop around but it is pretty convenient being next to the market.place is extremely clean and feel spacious. it doesn't have the lovely smell of anatol or the colorful look of oscar though which makes it boring. it lacks personality but still, a decent store to go to when one is in the market.
