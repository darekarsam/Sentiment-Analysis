2	Since moving back to Madison from San Diego in August, I have spent inordinate amounts of money on dry cleaning at Kinke Cleaners, which I thought was the only game in town.  However, the quality of their service was poor, in particular the pressing (especially for delicate fabrics like silk) and removal of smells from shirts.  I had to have items re-pressed and over time have become increasingly dissatisfied.  The final straw came this week - Klinke on University Ave. nearly destroyed a formal dress with complex folds on the bodice that I need to wear tomorrow to a black tie invited wedding in Chicago.  I had them re-press it, thinking it would be fixed; it was worse and I had no idea what I'd wear to the wedding.  Thankfully I found another dry cleaning company (Right Touch Dry Cleaners near Woodmans on the west side) that executed the job perfectly.  I will continue to bring some routine items (pants) to Klinke since it so close to my home/job, but will drive to the far west side for anything that needs high-quality treatment.
