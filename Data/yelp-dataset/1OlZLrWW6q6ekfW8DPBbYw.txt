5	It is really a good nail salon in Sun Prairie! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone who want their nail done!
5	It was such a wonderful experience to get a mani and a pedicure over there. All the staffs are so friendly. I would recommend this place to all my friends.
4	Nice modern interior and competitive prices. They were able to get me in last minute when my usual nail salon was booked. They were pretty busy and it took an hour before they started on me, but they stayed an hour after closing to finish all their clients.Great regular manicure was $20 ($15 plus $5 for removing old gel polish) and included a paraffin dip.
5	I moved to Madison/Sun Prairie area 2 years ago and have been looking for a good mani/pedi place since.  I have found that place in Blush.  This was the best best mani/pedi I have gotten.  Michelle was so awesome.  She was very thorough and friendly.  I'm used to being rushed out of salons, but she took her time and stayed after closing.  It was a great price.  $40 for a mani and pedi, which included a hot stone leg massage, paraffin hand dip and oil treatment.  Usually all of that is extra.  I can't wait to go back!
1	Appears to be a racist establishment. I was told the wait would be an hour. However the wait time was 5 minutes. They rushed my services and were very rude. I have been in here directly after work hence I was dressed up. No issue. But today I had on sweat pants as it was my day off. They made an assumption about me that was completely false.  Will not return.
