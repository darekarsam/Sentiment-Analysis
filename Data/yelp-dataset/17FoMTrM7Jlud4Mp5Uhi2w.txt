5	Exploring this old downtown area I was not expecting to find this!  Cool Comic Book store!  The owner was very friendly and knowledgeable!
4	This shop does not always open on time, but the selection and prices are amazing. They have an extensive selection to choose from. It does not look like a lot from the outside, but if you like comics this is a great place to stop by.
4	Great spot went in for supplies! Great prices and huge selection found my new favorite card and comic shop.Only problem I passed it a few times before finding it if using GPS to find it when they say you are there look to the right!!
5	So to be honest I dont really know a lot about comic books, but coming here I didn't feel like I was being judged on that. The owner was super friendly and very helpful. He seems to know a lot about basically anything you're interested in. Extremely friendly, and compared to the (one) other comic book store I've been in this one has an amazing selection.
