5	The best out of all the filibertos. Gets my order right all the time and comes out great.
4	This place has the best lengua (tongue)of any of the filibertos restaurant. And the chicken enchiladas are great too.I would if given them 5 stars but there was one occasion it was thick and not as well cooked maybe the regular cook was out that day. Other than that best one I've tried in the Phoenix tolleson area.
4	If you live in the phoenix metro you've heard of filibertos. This particular location is newer and clean unlike the other ones i have been to. The food quality is tasty and comes in big portions. I come here when i need a taco fix. I always get the 5 taco plate that comes with carne asada, adobada, lengua, al pastor, and my favorite carnitas. Its awesome and inexpensive a lot better than eating bk mcds. Love this place. Try it!
