4	It is good to be able to go to the mall and find what sporting equipment or athletic shoes, or something as simple as an airpin!  When I need new workout gloves, I can always depend on Dick's to have my preferred brand...and a very reasonable price.  Overall, the store is great....and I have even received some pointers on how to get better putts!!! And my girls love to go in when getting new sneakers and wak the mini-track to ensure proper fit and feel!!!  The only challenge, like most stores that are near the mall entrances is parking.   Prepare to walk at least 1/2 block or more unless you get lucky.
4	Best Stocked Dick's in the AreaMy wife, the most fanatical football fan that I know celebrated her birthday last week. While she is a dyed in the wool Pittsburgh Fan, what she wanted was a #59 Carolina Panter;s Kuechly Jersey.Found it at Dick's.  Had to look to find the right size but the staff was great and helped us find it right away.Store is well laid out, very well organized and the store personnel are outstanding. The know their merchandize and answer questions quickly and accurately.That said, with Dick's only about 10 minutes from my house, this made for one of the easiest birthday shopping trips ever.
3	Who doesn't like Dicks....right?I really like their selection of local sports wear.Panthers, Hornets, UNC Charlotte and all the ACC teams.
