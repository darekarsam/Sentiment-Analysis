4	A great place to grab brunch or lunch on a summer's day. I love the huge backyard with picnic tables. It's such a great spot to eat in, it makes you feel like you're out of the city.  The food is solid, beer selection is alright and prices are reasonable. While it didn't blow me away, it's a solid option if you live in the neighbourhood, and the backyard space blows away a street side terrace any day.
4	A great little gem of a brunch restaurant in the neighborhood. The staff were super friendly and accommodating. The food was unpretentious and tasty. We both had omelettes with house salsa that was flavorful. The price was very reasonable for the quality of food.It was a very casual and relaxing atmosphere.
2	My friend and I decided to go here because of the reviews on Yelp. Because of the number of English reviews, I thought there would be a portion of the menu in English. There wasn't but our servers did speak English. The food took an awfully long time to arrive at our table. Two tables who arrived later than us both got their food earlier than us. We didn't even get water until we asked for it. If you don't speak a bit of French, I wouldn't recommend going here. But if you're ok with that and a long wait time for food, the price for the amount of food is pretty decent.
5	Stumbled upon this great cafe on accident. Even though they were pretty busy, we were seated, allowed to order, and served within a short time. We spoke almost no French (though my lovely boyfriend uttered attempts), and the waitresses were still kind and patient (and spoke English). The food was excellent--healthy, hearty, and delicious--and even better, it was the cheapest price tag we've seen all over the city. If you want a local, passionate eatery, look no further.
