3	Silvi's has Mexican and Southwestern and burgers on the menu.  Waiter told us that most items are homemade including soups, chili, salsa's and tortilla's.  Also, the owner/chef is from Texas and wife is Mexican.   Chose a Creamy Corn/Poblano soup that was delicious.  Thick with nice flavors, still green poblano so not hot, just a nice flavoring.  The chips were good and the mild salsa was really tasty but spicier than expected for a mild.   The pork taco was good with a tasty corn tortilla.  The pork was not very flavorful and probably a little overcooked, but the toppings and salsa were very tasty.The place is small and very casual.  Would expect a bigger crowd especially on weekends, once the Southside crew learn about Silvi's.

For the appetizer, we had the cheese wedges, which were the perfect blend of crunch and spice. The breading was delicious, and provided a great shell for the melty pepperjack cheese inside. Silvi's Big Burrito (I think that's what it was called) was SO delicious, and just as good the next day! My mom had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, which she raved about. For dessert we tried the Choco-Flan, which was the perfect end to the meal. All of the food was very fresh and tasted home-cooked. I highly recommend Silvi's Southside Kitchen and will make it a point to eat there every time I am in town!
