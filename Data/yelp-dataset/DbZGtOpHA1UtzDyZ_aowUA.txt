5	Dr. Blackwell and her staff at Desert Sky Animal Hospital have gone above and beyond being kind and gentle to our animals. They will go out of their way to accommodate your needs. The waiting room is always clean, open and friendly. Dr. Blackwell is very knowledgable at her practice and patient with any questions you may have. Highly recommend them.
5	I recently moved to AZ from CA and was extremely nervous about finding a new veterinarian. I have been a vet tech for the past 6 years so I'm very particular about who treats my animals. The clinic looks brand new and is very clean, the staff are nice and helpful, and Dr. Blackwell is wonderful. She was welcoming, great with my dog, and very knowledgeable. I definitely am making her my primary care vet and highly recommend her.
