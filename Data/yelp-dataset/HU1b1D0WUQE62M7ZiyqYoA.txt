5	Great prices and friendly staff!
5	Wonderful staff!! So helpful & the prices we're very reasonable.
2	They do have some really cute stuff, but this whole new pricing thing...it blows.Things were so much more less expensive before...However, if they'd follow suit with other JCP's and add a Sephora...I'd be there weekly!
4	Yay! Sephora is finally here!! This is the only reason I decided to return to JcPenney. I was pleasantly surprised that things have once again been changed to include sales. In fact it seems that the whole store seemed back to normal with sales and clearance. I may actually start shopping here again.
