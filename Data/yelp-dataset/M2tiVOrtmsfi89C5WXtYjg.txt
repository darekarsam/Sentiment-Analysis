5	Someone that understands business. I just went in to get a new battery. I didn't have any cash on me so he told me to come back whenever and pay him. I don't often go to watch repair shops, but if I ever need to or someone asks I will certainly send my business to DeChance. I will also be going back tomorrow to pay him.
5	Doug has been maintaining my two Rolex watches for over a decade.He is honest, and technically superb.A  pleasure to work with!
5	Doug did a great job on my Tag. It took longer then expected but was not his fault. Fixed it and polished it like new. I highly recomend him.
5	Always professional and reliable service for big or small jobs. I highly recommend their services.
