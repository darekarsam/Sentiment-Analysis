4	Great, quick Pad Sew!  Brand new location, clean and a definite return visit in my future.
4	Clean, fast, consistent and service with a smile.. what more can u ask for a Thai fast food place.
3	2.5 out of 5.  I'll bump it up to 3 as the eating surroundings are simple and nice!  Checked this joint out as it is a dual Thai Express and other side is Sushi Shop.  I had sushi as I ate a huge lunch today.  Sushi shop to me is the lesser side of mediocre.  They cut their sushi fish as thin as Tim Horton's cuts their bacon.  You couldn't think fish could be cut so thin!  They must use lasers to do it!  Anyway, I found the rice a bit too sweet and rice texture didn't taste as fresh even though we ordered it ahead!  Also I believe they sell sushi @ "highway robbery" prices.  This is Montreal sushi however and as I've mentioned before I'm spoiled as I have Vancouver and Toronto sushi to set the bar for me!I actually try to avoid eating sushi here in Montreal as I know it's usually way too expensive and quality is questionable!  Call me a sushi snob but I eat it it quite a bit!  Check my other reviews if you don't believe me!
1	It's the worst Thai Express. Very bad customer service. I told the girl I wanted my meal to be spicy (she is supposed to ask me but she didn't so I said it myself). After I didn't see her put it on the bill, I asked her: it will be spicy right? She said yes. And guess what? Not only it wasn't spicy at all, but the pad sew was so dry. I took a take out so I couldn't waste more time to go back. She charged extra when I asked for a bowl instead of the usual tight box when the other Thai Express don't do that. Not only I didn't get something worthy of the money I was paying, the cashier was just busy chattering with her colleagues and didn't pay attention to giving the right service.
