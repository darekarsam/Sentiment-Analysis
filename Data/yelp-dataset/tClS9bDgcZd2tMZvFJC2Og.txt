5	I found a living social deal for Sol Crossfit. I had a few unanswered questions before purchasing.  I reached out and Lance was very friendly and professional in addressing all of my concerns.  We are beginners and we are looking forward to our first class just based on the great service we have received.

5	Different than any crossfit gym you've ever been to. From the moment you walk in the door one of the many coaches greets you immediately and gives you the tour of the gym. Pointing out all their unique amenities available to all members. Not only does the support and motivation from the coaches set SCF apart from it's competitors but encouragement from the other friendly members definitely creates a very welcoming community feel. And to top things off they are also active in helping the community and host monthly events to give back. I'm hooked!
5	I never had any desire to try crossfit, but a good friend of mine talked me into trying it.  Long ago I lost interest in "regular" gyms but was needing something to pair with running/hiking/biking to help with toning and regain muscle.  I'm so glad I tried it, and even more glad this is the gym I tried!  The people are what make it awesome- the coaches are super nice and friendly, and genuinely care about your health, fitness, goals and progress. They teach you form and don't push weight on you until you have it right, which is important.  The members are all great too.  Even if you are shy, you will make friends and feel comfortable quickly.  There are different levels of workouts for each session, and even the most out of shape or most fit people could get a good workout in.  Sol (& coaches) has really motivated me and I'm excited to see my progress.  This place also gets mad bonus points for being dog-friendly!  Definitely worth checking out!
5	As a serial quitter I never stuck with anything because of laziness or lack of motivation. I tried a groupon for sol at the beginning of the year and I can honestly say it changed my life. I stopped wasting time at the gym pretending to work out and now I wake up sore every day. I took a break for a couple of months and when I came back I thought people were going to judge me for being a slacker but it legitimately felt like they were happy to see me. Everyone makes you feel like part of group and are super motivating. they ar e great at encouraging you at the end of a work out to make you feel proud of yourself and actually keep coming bak. Lance, Joy and Jake are some of the best people I have ever met. super genuine and sincere. I live 30 minutes fro mthe gym and if I ever transfer jobs Im certai nIll still make th e drive to come to this gym
