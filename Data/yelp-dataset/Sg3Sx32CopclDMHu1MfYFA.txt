4	Customer service at this location was top notch. Good job guys!From the second I walked in the door to the check-out counter I was well taken care of. It is really nice to walk into a store and not be hounded by all the sales folks, but when I was unable to find what I needed on my own there was someone there to help me. This Office Max is like most other office supply store, except the customer service at this location was stellar!
4	The clerk in the printing area was extremely helpful.  He was able to answer my questions and thoroughly explain his answers.
2	Items in the Office Depot / Office Max ad that show trade in on old printer. This is for select models of purchase. However, none of those models for purchase are in stock. Bait and switch to be sure. In fact, one of the models has never been carried at the store. The other has been sold out for quite some time. In order to take advantage of this deal you need to drive 30 minutes in any direction to a different store.
