5	Stepped in here on the request of my husband and was pleasantly thrilled at the place. This is a great aviary place. a lot of the birds that were surrended by their previous owners, some are 2nd or 3rd home birds.They have small birds as well as large Macaws. some of the birds have health issues that they are being treated for from either poor nutrition, or environment issues so some have no feathers which is sad.they have lots of toys to purchase and treats and they offer free classes to educate people on birds behavior and activities. their birds are available for adoption, and they also offer boarding services. If you own a bird this is a great place to stop in and check out
5	A stellar selection of food and toys. Superb retail shop with fair prices and it helps to know that the retail selection helps birds in need. The real star here is the staff and services offered. If you have absolutely ANY questions about your parrot this is the place to go. They know their stuff and are happy to share with anyone who wants to learn about parrots or has a question/issue with a parrot at home. The classes are FREE - absolutely no catch whatsoever. All of them (yes, I've taken all but one) are highly informative and an absolute must for parrot owners. I started classes here before my parrot hatched and by the time she arrived at the airport I felt more than prepared to handle any issues that may come up and if I don't know then I know exactly who to call!
