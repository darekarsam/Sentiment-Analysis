1	when i was in high school a friend of mine worked here. one day while at work he was bored and put his boot in the fryer. lol. it melted his heel. i remember the food being decent at best and the location was pure scary. i also heard a urban myth about this place. Ed and Pete were close friends and they both had a fish an chip place, and they were partners. Pete wanted to expand, Ed didn't, Ed ended up dead. murdered under suspicious cercumstances...then Pete opened up a few other shops...now you see Pete all over the valley..and Ed just gets a crappy review from me. i wonder how much of the above is true. i'm too lazy to look up police records to confirm it. but none the less. a great phoenix foodie urban myth.
