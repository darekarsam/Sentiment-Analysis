5	GREAT esthetician! I got a chemical peel and a vitamin E and collagen mask treatment.  She knew exactly what to use on my skin type to get my face feeling clean and looking healthy! She made me feel very comfortable throughout the process and was helpful by explaining what treatments would be best for me, the products she was using, and why. It helped me to understand my skin a lot better. My skin felt very hydrated and refreshed afterwards and I even received a few compliments on my glowing complexion! I would highly recommend!
5	I love Kyong!! She is so knowledgeable about skincare. I've lived in Vegas for almost two years now and have noticed a change in my skin. Luckily, I met Kyong. My skin's appearance is so much brighter. Not only is Kyong very knowledgeable, she also provides the best customer service. Her professionalism and expertise will keep you coming back for more. Thanks, Kyong
5	LOVED my facial! She adds special touches per face type (oily, acne probe, sensitive) etc and truly takes the time to explain thorough skin care routines. She goes behind just treating your skin, but preventative measures as well. Nicest esthetician you will find out here in Vegas. I highly Reccomend coming to Kyong for anything & everything! 5 stars and nothing less!
