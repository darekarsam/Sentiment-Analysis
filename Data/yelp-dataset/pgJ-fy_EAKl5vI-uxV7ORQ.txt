3	I hadn't had Papa John's for at least a year.  It's one of the better chain pizza places, and unlike the Domino's that moved, it's conveniently on my way home from work.  I got a $10 gift card for $5 from www.saveology.com and they had their large specialty pizzas for $11.  The large is only 14" which isn't really large, but the Spinach Alfredo pizza is pretty tasty.  I was disappointed they no longer put the butter sauce and pepporncini in the pizza box, but I understand it.  The service was a little slow as they have two registers but only one person working on one of them with a lot of people standing around.  I'd stop here for a pizza on my way home again if the price was right.
3	For a papa johns restaurant it's exactly what it's suppose to be. It's quick, good customer service, and accurate. Prices are more than dominos, but that's not this particular stores fault.
1	We ordered from them mid day during the week for delivery.  It took 2 hours and our pizza was cold.  We were told by the manager that they would give us a free pizza.  We called back a few days later to order and there was no record of the incident.We will never return.
