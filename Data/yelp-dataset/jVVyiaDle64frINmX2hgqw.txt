2	Blech! Darren's often too nice in his reviews. The pizza was really greasy, and the bacon was minimal. It's just a little shack of a joint on a desolate street where you'd think you might meet Freddie Kruger after dark! But Darren was dying to go here just so he could review it, and it sucked, didn't it sweetie? ;) They didn't even deliver to us. I had to drive him there just to get it, and you can't eat in either. Cash only. Avoid.We could have ordered from Slice, which I like and is in our hood, but noooo...:D
