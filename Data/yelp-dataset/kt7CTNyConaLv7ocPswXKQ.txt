3	I came here because Imperial Spa was closed for renovations. My sister and I were in town to celebrate her birthday and after a long night of partying we wanted our massage/scrub. This place looks totally sketch from the outside. It's in a desolate strip mall/office strip complex directly across the Gold Coast and you feel like you're gonna get an STD if you look at the place for more than 2 seconds. The windows are painted over with a faded Niagara Falls-esq scenic handpainting...the kind you see at really bad seafood restaurants and we ALMOST didn't go in. Turns out it's not so bad! It's clean and has the essentials of any korean spa. There are no jade rooms or anything fancy like that but totally did the trick. The little lady here gave me a better massage and scrub down than the ladies at the Imperial Spa. She hopped up on the table and even walked on my bad and feet! Weird but totally cool. Definitely worth checking out.
