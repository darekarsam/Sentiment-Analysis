2	The preliminary visit went well, the procedure was smooth, but the follow up was ridiculous. My appointment was at 2:30; I don't like to keep people waiting so I was early. I was showed into the Dr. Pasha's office at 3:10 pm, at 3:20 pm I left without seeing the Dr. I feel this is incredibly unprofessional and no way to treat a customer. My time is valuable too. No one ever said anything to me like, "We're sorry but the Dr is running way behind." Who knows how much longer I would have been there waiting, waiting, waiting ...
3	Have been coming here since May for a specific issue, while the wait is always long, Dr Weisz is very warm and assuring. Staff leaves much to be desired and their education on Gastro diseases is minimal. I  only wish Drs in general and specifically this team knew more about proper diet to help heal and restore health, the entire staff was eating McDonalds when I was waiting, that's disappointing. Dr Weisz could be more forthcoming and helpful about whole health
1	Terrible.  Overbooked and forced to wait an hour over appointment time after time.  If insurance let me go to other doctors would in a heartbeat.Poor bedside manner not too friendly.  Very disappointed.
