1	Whatever Einstein Bros. serves, it is not a bagel.  Bagels are boiled, and Einstein serves up a round, puffy, baked roll with a hole in the middle.  No boiling involved, since that is time-consuming, i.e., expensive, and creates real bagels with a chewy consistency.You might like their rolls, but they really shouldn't call them bagels.
2	This Einstein's has seen better days. We stopped here on a road trip to grab a bagel and coffee and it was dirty.  They only had one coffee available (Vanilla Hazelnut) so we we disappointed with that lack of selection.
2	I felt like I was bothering the employees here with my order. It took me making eye contact with three employees (one of whom was standing around) before anyone came over to take my order.
5	Great place to eat. The place is pretty clean the staff is very friendly and the good is great! Come on and get a bagel!
4	Realistically when you enter a bagel place don't expect to be blown away by anything but the bagels,schmear and coffee. I have never been into an Einstein before but was there yesterday morning and was very delighted by the pleasant staff and bagels available. Some of the bagels I wanted  to go weren't available but the wonderful man taking my order said if I was planning on eating there, the bagels they had in the oven would be done. The place isn't spotless but for the area it is in I am happy to see pleasant/polite people who have wonderful customer service and so I didn't take away any points for that. I do wish they had the pumpkin bagel but I am happy with the bagels I am now eating this morning and because of that will try and get there earlier to grab a pumpkin bagel!
