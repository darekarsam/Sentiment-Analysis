5	Awesome place to worship! It's a come as you are environment and everyone is welcome! Everyone from the ushers to the choir and pastor himself greet you with a smile! They even provide breakfast, so I'm encouraging you to at least visit them once I promise you will be amazed!
5	I absolutely love my SCC Family!
5	In seeking a new church home, I was lead to Sanctuary.....The motto of this church is 'Daring to do church differently" which I found to be the truth.  From the men that greet you warmly at the door, to the coffee and donut holes, to the soul stirring praise and worship team, and a Grammy award level house band and a real and relevent  message from Pastor Reeves on in his stead Minister Jimmy.... 9;00 am service, mark it on your calender and give it a try....you'll be back.....
