5	Steve's Hot Dog Shop just reopened as Nana's Hot Dog Shop and it's amazing!  If you haven't been there yet then you need to try it out!
5	It's hot dogs, french fries and soda. They do one thing and they do it well. Hot dogs come in two kinds: pork and beef.
5	This place is great, I didn't know a hot dog could be so good. The beef hot dog was bangin', the chili sauce was bangin', the fries were bangin', the prices were bangin'. 5/5, would eat there again.
2	The hot dogs are good, but every time I go there the line for ordering is unorganized and chaotic.  Sometimes I have to wait over 10 minutes to even have my order taken.  I've often been in there when people flip out because they had to wait a long time for their food, which for hot dogs, really shouldn't take that long.  I love the hot dogs there but they need some better organization for handling the orders when a lot of people come in.  Organize the line, greet people when they come in, acknowledge they're there...don't just make them sit and wonder if you saw them or if they're gonna get served.  Also, try to keep the drama out.  People have made a scene several times when I was in there and it makes me want to leave.  I don't want to witness drama when I just wanted to get a hot dog.
