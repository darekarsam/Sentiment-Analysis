5	I have had my hair highlighted and cut by Meghan for the past 6 years. I love how she does my hair. Sometimes I want something specific and she listens to me and does exactly what we discussed. Other times I leave it up to her and she always has great ideas. Meghan is willing to be flexible with her appointments so that I can have my hair done when it fits my busy schedule.
5	Love love love my hair cut. I can't wait to go back this month. I have had many compliments on my hair.
5	I'm new to the area and had procrastinated finding a stylist long enough.  Meghan's great reviews on yelp and other sites were spot on.  A very pleasant and easy going lady who gives a great cut, color and style.   I was able to book an appointment for the next day as well, and no wait at all when I arrived.  Thank you!
