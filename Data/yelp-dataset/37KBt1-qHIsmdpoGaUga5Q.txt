1	I bought a protective case last night, paid 15 for it.this morning when the phone dropped on the floor the case broke! I took it back to the store to either replace it or get a refund. The sales person who is the same person that sold us the case last night dayes that we proudly broke it and therefore there is no exchange. Apparently there is no sign that says sales are final plus this person does not even give you receipt! Therefore he offered me to buy another one and pay him 7 dollars, what a joke. Be aware of this company and their deceptive and shady sales with no receipts!I handed him the broken case abd told him to keep it. He took it and put it back right next to the new ones. I basically threw away the money abd was hoping he had the decency to make it right
1	Had a similar experience, case fell apart after a week and the sales person refused to give a refund or replacement. Same issue the sales person wanted cash and did not give a receipt so he did not have to charge tax or claim the sale. This place should investigated for tax fraud. I am also disappointed with the mall management for allowing such a dishonest retailer to operate. This place is a ripoff and their products are garbage. Avoid Cellairis at all cost!!!!
1	No costumer service at all. A broken iPad case ( broke after two weeks) didn't get repaired or returned.  We put 40$ in trash due to that.  AVOID!
