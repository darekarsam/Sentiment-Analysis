5	The Dog Run is one of the best bars in town, the food selection is varied with amazing selections. The two chef's prepare amazing burgers, grilled sandwhiches and large salads. The Prime Rib and Fish Fry Specials are cheap and tasty. Great atmosphere for sports, dogs and chasing the thirst after a long day's work. Highly reccomend for lunch or dinner.
5	Fresh hot fish all you can eat every day. Some of the best fish I have had in Arizona. A clean  well run bar with pool. Very good friendly and efficient waitress. Beats the Dirtwater. My wife had a delicious ruben. An excellent place with a great bar atmosphere and reasonably priced.

4	I was on a date in Apache Junction. My buddy said come here since there is only a few good places in Aj. Cool bartenders, cheap beer and good food. The karaoke on wed was awesome lol. But yeah, next time I rub though AJ I will most likely stop through here because it was not that bad of a place.
5	Great atmosphere, great service, great WiFi! latitude was our bar of choice during our three week stay in AZ. I reckon wee went there at least every second night. Zane our waitress was just sensational. It was she who made our experience the best; she looked after us and we became friends. The personal touch was just brilliant. The rest of the staff were great too and the patrons we mingled with were fantastic. The food was fantastic! the drinks perfect! It was like a bar like home, away from home. Bottoms up! Cheers !!!
4	Pleasant waitress prices are great food was excellent. We have been hete at least 5 times now and when lost for a place to go we end up here.
