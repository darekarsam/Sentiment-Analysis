4	I deal with them occasionally through my work and they have always done a good job and reliable. I bought a used Ford truck that only had one key and I needed to get a spare transponder key. They  gave me a fair quote (Rodeo Ford wanted $45 more and by appointment only) and I will be going there in the next few days for that key.
1	First of all if you have a sign on your door that say you are open till 5pm be there!!!!    So then when i finally got their earlier in the day, i was really surprised that the old guy that say he owns the place is such a grump.   I have had keys made in the past and the young lady that works their is so friendly.  I must have woken him up from his nap.  I am sorry I didn't spend a ton of money at your place, but I will never spend 1 more $ there ever again.   AVOID VERY RUDE AND NOT HELPFUL AT ALLI really think some of these small business owner need to realize what customer service really is all about.

The next day a technician showed up on time and ready to work. He showed me exactly what he would be doing and gave me a rundown of the costs and the total bill. He finished the job and I paid. I had no problems with them or the price or the quality of the job whatsoever. So I think it's safe to trust them anyone.
