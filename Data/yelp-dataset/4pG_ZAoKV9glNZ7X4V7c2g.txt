5	Great location. Friendly staff. Fast service what else could you ask for. The doctor was very nice and really informative.
1	Rude and slow. Arrived 455 for drug screen for new employment. Still sitting at 520. Not only did the front desk person announce my "drug screen" to everyone but she took all patients in order despite the fact that I didn't need to see a doctor. Simple UA. Never again.
5	Came in and was greeted, explained the forms and taken back quickly. The tech who did my vitals and reviewed my history was nice and personable! The nurse practitioner on staff answered my questions thouroughly. Will come back when necessary!
