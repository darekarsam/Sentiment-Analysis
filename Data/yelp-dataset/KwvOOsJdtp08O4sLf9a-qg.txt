3	My friend lied to me and told me montreal had real beaver tail....so stupid me, i went up to the cashier and asked him if it was real beaver tail and he said YESSS. My face dropped and he stood there laughing at me. bahahahathis place is great for dessert, it's sorta like an auntie anne's in the mall. We tried the cinnamon sugar, and it was veryyyy sugary. It was overly sweet, but i liked it. I wish it was served hot, cause it was hard and felt like it had been sitting there for some time. Way overpriced though, it was almost 6 bux for a tail! And we had nothing on top of it. It was half the size of a regular fried dough.
3	The best place to go for a mid-day pick me up. I love their banana Nutella one. It's not too sweet, just right. You can also try their smoothies, which are the same price as the Beaver Tails (probably a better deal 'cause you get actual fruits instead of sugar).
3	I stopped by BeaverTails on my way lunch today and here are my thoughts.This place must have been a big hit in the past before people realized that deep fried food is bad for you. If you want 3000 thousand calories packed in a palm sized snack go for it and dont be surprised if your heart start beating just a notch too fast.I am a fan of sweet foods and had a bite from my friend who ordered cinnamon sugar and this much sugar could probably kill a mid sized horse if its had one of these for a week.I did buy their smoothie and thats why they get 3 stars. It was actually good :)
