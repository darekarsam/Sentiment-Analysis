4	I was looking for a place to print out a 1 page PDF form. Places like bureau en gros have minimum orders so I was looking for another place to do it. I stopped off to get cash at the bank before getting bagels and I saw Copie 2000 and thought I'd drop in to give it a shot.Not realizing how they work, it took some time, however I realized that this place is probably one of the best copy shop models across Montreal. Drop in, they'll ask you what you need, either do it for you or direct you to 1 of maybe 8 self-use computers. Grab a document, note the time you get on the computer on it, print out your documents on the printer they told you to use, grab your print outs, finish marking off your time sheet and then go pay at the cash registers in the other room. Takes time the first time around, but once you know how it works it goes pretty quick.As their folder describes, they do photocopies, computer graphics, digital printouts, commercial printing, stationary, finishing services, t-shirt printing and even send out faxes.If I was still in Montreal this would be my go-to print shop (over Copie Nova even).
1	Slow & expensive and overall the worst experience I ever had at a printer. It took them over 30 mins just to wire-o one document...!
2	Slow and understaffed. Paying takes way too long. Computers and printers are at best average
