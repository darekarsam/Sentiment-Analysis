4	I love this location !My favorite is the macho burrito ( Huge ) and the french fries all for about $5 give or take plus tax.Del Taco is right next door to the ghetto Circkle K so you can't miss it.  They have great specials from time to time such as .39 cent tacos.If you live near one give them a try.
5	Del Taco is to Taco Bell what Church's Chicken is to KFC.a better product for less money. WORD TO THE MUFFUGGIN WORD.
4	Typical Del Taco, located inside Circle K. There are tables and chairs to sit at inside and a drive thru. I like this location because it is so convenient- I can get gas, tacos, beer, and a movie from 1 of the 2 redbox kiosks all at one stop!There are taco deals on tue and thur 3-11. I believe it's 3 beef for $1 tues, and 3 chicken  for $2 on thurs.The staff is friendly and always gets my order right. No complaints!
3	Still love the food for what it is. Service is friendly but it's been a consistent long wait whether its inside or drive thru for over a month now. Please hire more night staff! This is frustrating!'
2	Too much Spanish here. Employees are loud and obnoxious. I sat in my truck, couldn't listen to the constant bla bla any longer.
1	This was the worst del taco ever! The chips in the nachos were totally stale. The fries were cold and the service was VERY mediocre! Being from out of town and getting such poor food was SO DISAPPOINTING!
