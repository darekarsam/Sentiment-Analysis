4	I was a little concerned after reading one review after I had already made a reservation. I did check out the company with the Better Business Bureau and seen they had an A+ rating.  Additionally I called the Real Estate division to make sure the company was legitimate.  All checked out and I stayed at the property called "Movie Star Luxury" this January with 12 girlfriends for a bachelorette party.  Great property and  a definite thumbs up to Crystal Properties!  Here is the property I rented which I would definitely recommend for this type of event.  http://lvnvacationhomerentals.com/index.php
5	Yooohoo just came back from Vegas and have to say that was a blast.We rented a furnished rental property from Crystal Properties and Peter Anello. The house was very comfortable and very clean. At night we decided to use the Jacuzzi but could not figure out how to turn it on with the directions provided. Peter Anello personally came over at 11p.m. on a Saturday and helped us turn everything on. Overall experience was very pleasant, it was easy to make the reservation and the house was in good order when we arrived. Definitely will be renting from Peter Anello again. When you are ready to go to Vegas I would highly recommend this one particular property here is the link: http://www.lvnvacationhomerentals.com/crystal-properties-227599.html
5	At first i was really hoping it wasnt a scam, but once we got the info and got to the property everything was more than perfect. stayed for 5 days. any questions we had ,peter was able to answer right away. Already planning to use CPI for next years trip
