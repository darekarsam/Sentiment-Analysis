4	A nice Starbucks that accepts mobile payments, unlike the other location further down Mont-Royal. Sweet n' Low loyalists beware though- they don't carry the pink packets here. Only Equal and Splenda.
4	Starbucks is great although not a fan of this layout.  Plus way to many people chillin' for like 2-3 hours straight.
5	Good place after night work to relax a little bit and drink a hot drink in the Winter. Feel warmed and satisfied.
