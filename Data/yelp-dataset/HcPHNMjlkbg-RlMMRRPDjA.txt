5	Very happy I found this dentist. He is very skilled, gentle and efficient. I just got my wisdom teeth out there and it was done in under 30 minutes and healed up easy peasy. His staff is very friendly as well. He does all his own dental hygiene which seemed odd at 1st but I actually have come to like it best. Guess that makes things flow even faster. I have never had more than a 5 minute wait when I have gone in.
5	I've been in and out of many dental chairs in my sixty years; done just about everything you can do to one's teeth, even fell asleep during a root canal once. So, when I felt the pain of an abscessed tooth, I knew the drill (no pun intended) and found Dr. Davis. What a joy to work with. Great staff, nice office, got me into his chair within an hour after I called and scheduled my next appointment for day after tomorrow. I didn't think it was possible for any dentist nowadays to make appointments so soon. Very gentle, very knowledgeable and like one other reviewer wrote "no nonsense." To top it all, he discounted his examination and x-ray because I don't have dental insurance. I should have found this guy years ago. Five stars!
