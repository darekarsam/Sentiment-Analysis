5	Dr Faylona is great! She is very understanding and checks everything!  Oh and she listens to her pat!
3	Doctor, Physician's Assistant, Nurse Practitioner and staff are good!Main issue for me is just the office-- it's run down, definitely old, it wreaks of all sorts of weird, bad smells and the lighting in the office is always so dim and low.After all, you should feel the sense of cleanliness and care coming into a doctor's office.
5	Dr Faylona is the best there is, the best there was, and the best there will be!!LolKidding aside, Dr Faylona has more than 18 years of experience as a family doctor. Straight forward but devoted to patient care. Office staff are very efficient and can speak many languages like Filipino, Spanish and English. They also perform Blood draws etc. in the office so thats saves us a lot of time waiting and traveling. Busy doctor so make an appointment!! Tell her Rick James sent you. =)
