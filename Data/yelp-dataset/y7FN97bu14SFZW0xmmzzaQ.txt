5	Maid Brigade in Gilbert made my life so much easier. They were extremely professional, arrived on time, and worked around my time constrictions. My mother and I arranged for a "deep clean" for my Sister who just delivered her first child. Through out the process they were much better than other experiences I've had with cleaning services. They even tried to be as quiet as possible so they didn't disturb the newborn. Although we've only used the services once, I would highly recommend the Gilbert team. I read reviews on Kudzu to find them, but I wanted to give my fellow Yelpers a heads-up!
5	I don't use a housecleaning service regularly, but for those times when I feel like the house can use a professional "deep cleaning," I've always relied on Maid Brigade.  They make the entire process seamless - everything, from start to finish.  The scheduling is extremely fast, and I've never had an issue with them getting back to me.  The ladies who come to clean the house are always professional and friendly.  They are considerate with our belongings and furniture, which I appreciate.  The house always looks and smells amazing afterwards, and I'm constantly amazed at how much two ladies can do in such a short amount of time (it does kind of put me to shame). :)
