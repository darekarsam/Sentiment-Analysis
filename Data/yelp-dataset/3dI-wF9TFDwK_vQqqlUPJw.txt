3	This is a pretty small Wine & Spirits Store, but it's convenient for me because it's close, on the way to/from work, and the parking is way less crowded than the Wine & Spirits Store by Whole Foods.
4	Great location for a wine/spirit store in the heart of Lawrenceville.  Small but packs a punch w lots of options on the wine, champagne, and alcohol fronts.  The price is in line and the service is friendly.  Oh and there is a great Byob spot down the street (Piccolo Forno).  In fact hubs and I came here last night and picked up 2 bottles of red, bottle of champs, and some vodka.  Total bill was $50.  I like you you cute little store!
