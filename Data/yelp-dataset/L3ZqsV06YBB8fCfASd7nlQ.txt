1	***BEWARE***Very unprofessional...we had a scheduled appointment at 8am and she arrived just after 12pm. I gave clear instructions on how I wanted my two golden retrievers to be TRIMMED. I went out several minutes after she began grooming my first dog to find that instead of trimming like I instructed she had SHAVED my dog!! She shaved my dog so close to the skin that she cut him in 5 areas on his body and has left razor burn throughout the rest. I wish I could upload pictures to show you the damage she has caused not to mention the pain my poor golden will have for the next several weeks. Please do your animal a favor and look elsewhere for a groomer. P.S. she claims she is Licensed and Insured but when you ask her to provide documentation she is unable. I will follow up with another review in a few weeks if anything else occurs.
1	***BEWARE***Very unprofessional...we had a scheduled appointment at 8am and she arrived just after 11am. I gave clear instructions on how I wanted my two golden retrievers to be TRIMMED short but NOT SHAVED. It took almost 4 hours for her and her assistant to complete the job and instead of trimming like I instructed she had SHAVED my dogs!! Later that day I realized that she had shaved my male dog (Jake) so close to the skin that she cut him in 5 areas on his body and left razor burn throughout the rest. If you look through her pictures you can see the pictures I uploaded  to show you the damage she has caused and give you an idea of the pain Jake is dealing with. Please do your animal a favor and look elsewhere for a groomer. When I confronted her over the phone and through text the next day, she claimed that her assistant must have done that to him. I demanded a full refund and she said she would not give me any of my money back. After hours of arguing with her, she then claimed that she had before and after photos of Jake that proved that he did not leave her van looking like that, implying that I must have shaved him more after she left!! I never wanted my dogs shaved in the first place.. why on Earth would I shave him even more and inflict pain on him?! Two hours later, she finally sends me a picture of some random dog's backside that she claims is Jake's. First of all, the color of the dog's coat is not even the same color as Jake's, the coat is still fluffy and not shaved at all, and there is tile in the background of the picture.. I am 95% sure there wasn't any tile in her van. The picture was so zoomed in that I couldn't even tell what part of the dog I was looking at (I uploaded this picture as well).This woman is a liar and is completely unprofessional!! DO NOT use her! P.S. she claims she is Licensed and Insured but when you ask her to provide documentation she is unable.
5	She groomed my dog, and my dog is like super super hyper. My fiance and I are really pleased with my lyla being not so hairy and smelling so pretty. My vet has a hard time getting her to sit still, and Candice did it ease.
5	So cute, she groomed my dog again, and I am so amazed,  my dog is a pretty hairy dog, but not anymore. Lol and she bathed my chihuahua and they both both smell so good, and fresh.
5	I'm so glad I found her service called her early in the am told her I needed service asap within an hour she was at my home  I'm very satisfied & happy with the service I would recommend her & will continue to use her to groom my chihuahua
