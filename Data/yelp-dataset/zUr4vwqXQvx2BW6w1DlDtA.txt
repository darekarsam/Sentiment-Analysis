2	Coffee Fellows = Mediocre Espresso?I knew it before, but I gave it a try. I ordered an espresso.Inside of the Karlsruhe main train station beside of burger joints, asian fastfood and bakeries is a Coffee Fellows shop w/ drinks and bagels.The shop was a "greasy spoon" and two not very motivated employes tried to handle the few customers.The espresso arrived and as expected, it wasn't the best espresso.
