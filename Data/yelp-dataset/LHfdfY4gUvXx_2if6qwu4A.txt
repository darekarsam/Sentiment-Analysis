5	This is a lovely store with lovely things and lovely folks. I was purchasing something there and I had hours to kill before I had to pick someone up at the airport. I asked about local antique malls and the owner kindly drew me out excellent maps of nearby places and I spent the rest of the day quite happy.  I just love what I bought there too!
5	At Park Road Shopping Center there is a treasure of a furniture and accessory store frequented by designers and consumers alike that is owned and operated by a woman of impeccable taste and friendly demeanor.  This place never disappoints... lovely furnishings, lighting, art work, pillows, etc... it is pricey, so if you are looking for a deal, come during their semi-annual clearance sale- or check the back, where often there is sale merchandise.They fabricate orders and offer design services.
5	My husband and I love this store. The owner and designers are so friendly. Everything they have is gorgeous! I wish I could buys it all. We purchased two large, vintage framed prints from Traditions for a large space behind our couch and absolutely love them. We will be back!!
