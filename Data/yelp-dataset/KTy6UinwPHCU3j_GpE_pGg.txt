3	This Walgreen really is conveniently located at the intersection of two of the busiest streets in University area.  This store is 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  This store is getting old and the employees seem as if they are really tired of working at that place but they are nice.  The pharmacy staff are slow always!!!!  This store is not setup like your usual store but they have a lot of what you need.
2	Kind of a dingy version of the Walgreen's chain of drug stores.  I'm not sure how long it's been there but it seems like it has not aged well no matter how long it's been.Getting to the place is a challenge in this strip mall at the corner of Harris and Tryon but at least once you're there, the parking lot situation is not too bad given the decent number of reserved for Walgreen's spaces that exist.Finally, being open 24/7 is a plus at least.
3	For the location that it is in, a very busy intersection across from a hospital the parking lot is annoying to maneuver around. Once you finally make it into the store it is very hit or miss. And I'm talking everything from product selection, employee politeness and prescription availability. Went to Walgreens early in the morning (3am) and they where not able to fill a script because of it being written for the same day. Kinda makes being across from a hospital and having a 24hr pharmacy a waste of time. Children get sick in the middle of the night. How are you not going to dispense the medicine? Where not talking controlled substances here! I don't know that I would go back again.
