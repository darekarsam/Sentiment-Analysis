5	Ordered takeout; fried rice and crispy spinach and peanut butter tofu.  Although simple dishes, they were amazingly done by this restaurant.   Fresh not soggy and really tasty.
4	The only reason I give it a 4 start is because of service. If you happen to be served by the women... you won't appreciate her service. The rest of the guys are ok.The food is excellent. Must try the Hunan Dumplings (peanut butter sauce)The black pepper chicken is awesome also....The chef is the owner himself
4	Have eaten here for many years and always had great food. Ordered pan fried noodles with chicken and vegetables for take out. It was delicious and I had enough for 2 meals.
4	Our family had a fabulous meal here in this small, unassuming little restaurant on the corner.  The vegetable spring rolls were perhaps the best we've ever had: crispy, hot,amply sized and stuffed. Delicious. We also had a curried noodle dish, two chicken dishes (one was General Tao. It was wonderful!), and a simple tempura shrimp dish. All were perfectly cooked and seasoned.The waitress was attentive and the owner, Tony, stopped by to chat as well, to see how our meals were. Nice. As is custom, they brought us tea after the meal, with fortune cookies. My kids loved it.My only suggestion might be to serve rice with the dishes (especially the spicier dishes). But other than that, this is a super place for Chinese food!
