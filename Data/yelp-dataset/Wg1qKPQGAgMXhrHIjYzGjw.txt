5	We were very impressed with Matt Bartlett and the entire Granite Dude team. After consulting with 5 other businesses for granite for our New Phoenix home, we contracted with Granite Dude because Matt responded quickly, was well informed, a great listener and addressed all of our concerns. Pricing was very reasonable for a beautiful product! The installers arrived on time were respectful of us and our home and did a beautiful job on our kitchen. We have also contracted with them to do our bathroom. It was a pleasure working with them and we receive lots of compliments on our beautiful granite counters! You can't go wrong with Granite Dude!
5	Quick, efficient and friendly. They were so helpful and made it an easy and painless process.
5	Holy cow!  Granite Dude, Matt & the installer, Kirk, did an excellent job in our home.  They did our kitchen, laundry room, and a small powdwe room .  Matt was very respectful and listened to our concerns.  He walked us around the shop and showed us several beautiful pieces of granite. From low end to high end pricing. He paid attention to what we were saying and could totally understand the color scheme we were going for. Not once did I feel that he was being pushy or trying to over sell us at all. He was totally there for us. I was seriously blown away at the pricing and how incredibly quick the work was completed. When it came time for the measuring, cutting and installation, I was amazed at the respect that I and my home were given by Kirk.  He went above and beyond what I ever could imagine an installer would have to do. It was very important to him that the color flowed from the countertop up to the backsplash. It was very important to him at the color from one slab of granite flowed to another slab of granite. You can't even find the seem on our counters.  He is an artist at his work and takes great pride in what he does. I would give a gazillion stars to Granite Dude.
