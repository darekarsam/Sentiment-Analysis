4	So it seems like the outlets are not so much an outlet of extra stuff for stores, but a completely separate store with merchandise not found in the normal store.That being said I found a seriously adorable shirt here that I know is going to be a favorite. They also had my favorite sports bra from Gap Body for $16, so I was pumped!The store is relatively neat, probably not as tidy as it could be, but stuff seems to be where it is supposed to be, not thrown around everywhere.Worth the visit for sure.
1	As I was approaching the register, a very naive and young associate says very loudly to her coworker, "See, I told you they always come when I'm about to walk away". I  apologized, but she completely missed the sarcasm like I inconvienced HER. Sorry you had to do your job!
2	Not a fan.  Hey, no deals for us so only two stars.  Maybe that is not fair to give them only two stars.  The store was very clean and organized.  Staff was nice enough.We have always bought stuff at Gap outlet stores.  First time we came out empty-handed.To be fair, we would return here.  Maybe next time, we will have good deals.
