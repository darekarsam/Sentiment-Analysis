2	Might be a different country, but it is the same old Hard Rock.The usual food, the usual super happy waitress and the usual "why did I eat here", after you leave.
2	I've eaten at many Hard Rocks, and they're all the same and there's a certain fun charm to some of them. This one didn't have it. The servers were very interesting (my waitress was a McGill student from California, so we bonded over that) and the food was meh. I do enjoy their burgers, and that's what I always get, but the prices, the noise and the crowds all lead to a 2 in my book.
2	a good place to have a couple of beers,but basically is just another HRC,nothing special about it.
1	HORRIBLE place, food was absolutely disgusting. Greasy burger for like 15 dollars. I definitely said why did I eat here in my head after I left
2	Mediocre food and drinks. We were in for an early lunch (late breakfast) and staff was very slow and not very helpful.
