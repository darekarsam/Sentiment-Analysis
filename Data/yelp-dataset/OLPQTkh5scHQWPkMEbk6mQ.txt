1	If I could give them a zero I would. Called 4 times and emailed once for a home I have listed for sale as a Realtor. Never was able to get an appointment for estimate. Total waste of time. Who knows what kind of job they can do but customer service stinks!!
1	Terrible customer service!!! If I could give them negative stars, I would. They scheduled an estimate for me on a Thursday, they didn't show up, I called them, they said the rep was in Anthem and asked if I would reschedule for Saturday. I said yes. They called me today land left me a message stating that unfortunately, my zip code is out of their service territory. Then why do they have a sign advertising 2 miles away from my house!!!??? It's obvious these people do not know how to run a business if they can't even deliver on something basic like customer service!!!
1	NEEDS A ZERO....Used this company for years and had always been happy with Laurie (the "get it done girl") in customer service.  This year??  NOT SO MUCH! Estimator had NO IDEA what sort of vegetation I had in my yard and I had a total melt-down when they didn't give me what I was expecting from my proposal.  I spoke with Nicki (?) the estimator on the day the installers were on site...  She basically told me I had to eat it and live with what I had. She couldn't have cared less that I would be using another service next year especially when my proposal was twice what it was last year.  You see, I justified that when she indicated my magnolia tree was included in the price (20 feet +) I could almost understand the increase...  Nope she was talking about the Blueberry bush at 6 feet...  REALLY??BUYER BEWARE!!!!
