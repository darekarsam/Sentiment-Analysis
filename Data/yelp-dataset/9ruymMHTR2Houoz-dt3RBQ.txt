4	We keep going back for the 2 tacos + drink, $2.99, deal.
5	I can never turn away a good carne asada burrito.  Their value meals are good and the portions are decent
4	Filberto's is a chain I've been frequenting for over ten years. I've ordered up and down the menu and not found a bad thing yet.  Excellent, cheap drive-thru Mexican is my Achilles heel. If every city I went to had a Filberto's, I'd be a happy man.
4	Probably the best fast food Mexican place in town the Carne Asada fries, super nachos and rolled tacos are the best. The salsas are bomb, good spicy the way they should be. Highly recommend it, prices are fair for the quantity of food received. I liked it way better than Nico's.
