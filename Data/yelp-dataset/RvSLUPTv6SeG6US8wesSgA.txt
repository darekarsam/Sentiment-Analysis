4	Service is great, everything is home made. Very helpful staff.
4	This place introduced me to mole sauce and I am forever grateful!This restaurant is a little out of the way but worth the trip (Van Horne and St. Urbain)  I used to live in Montreal and when I come back for a visit, I make sure to visit La Hacienda.The guac is amazing and while I haven't tried many things on the menu, based on their mole sauce..I'm sold.
1	A place to skip for sure!  Food was tasteless and staff/service was horrible.  We all felt like we were bothering the waitress.  We ordered 6 meals and not one was flavorful.  There are too many wonderful restaurants to choice from, this not being one!
