1	Worst experience with any company I have ever dealt with. Nothing was completed when promised. Final deadline was missed. No estimates provided for any work. You have no idea what your budget is and when you ask you are not given any helpful information other than to go to the store and pick out like for like items. If you don't remember or know brands you are not provided any guidance. Regardless of whether you follow insurance allowances you will always be told you are over budget and need to pay out of pocket. Don't feel pressured to use this company, take your time and figure out how to do it on your own.
5	ATI has been continuously helpful to me and my business associates
5	Eric did a really great job of getting to the job in under 30 min of my reporting a problem and getting the site secured amid the chaos that was ensuing. He appointed Ron to be my project manager and Ron did a really exceptional job of manuvering through all the hoops with the city to get the permits we needed. There were a few issues along the way, but nothing unusual for a project of this size and Ron did a great job of getting them taken care of quickly. When it was all said and done the building is looking great and I'm happy with the results. I would recommend Eric Wingham and Ron James at ATI for your building restoration.
1	Had a bad experience with ATI.  My roof still leaks in three different area.  I am reminded of the bad experiences with them every time it rains.  In addition to a bad job on the roof, they lost personal property, took 3 times longer than promised, sloppy workmanship and used the cheapest subcontractors.If you have a fire or flood, find a contractor you trust.
