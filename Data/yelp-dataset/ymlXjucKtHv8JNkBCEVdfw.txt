1	Love flammable fabrics? Aged 15 and under? Looking for an outfit to wear when you try to get into Cav at the weekend? Then Quiz is the shop for you! Beloved of chavs and tarts alike, Quiz manages to stock an astonishing range of really awful clothes - I challenge you to find me something made of natural fibres. From diamante studded vests emblazoned with words like 'Sexy' to super short dresses made from clingy neon polyester, this place has it all. Clearly I am not a fan, but I honestly can't understand why anyone would want to part with their cash in here? And, given their target market you might expect things to be super cheap, it's not; which begs the question, who are they attempting to sell this rubbish to? Gullible mothers with scant regard for their daughter's chastity is the best I can come up with.
1	Quiz exists purely for people who are 12 and on "Mcat" to shop in. For whatever reason, whoever I am with, whenever we walk past here one of us will always make some sort of  witty comment about this place.Quiz basically dresses the teen mothers and Jeremy Kyle guests of the future. If you want to dress like the McQueens from Hollyoaks then this shop is ideal. Apart from that, avoid!
3	Has very cute clothing and the price is pretty decent which makes it all the worse for me as I am famously stingy, but I couldn't help myself.It has a huge variety of casual and clubbing outfits... Looking for something to wear on a night out, I would recommend this place for sure.
