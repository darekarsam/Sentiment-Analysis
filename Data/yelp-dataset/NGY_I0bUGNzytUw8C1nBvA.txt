2	MWas in yesterday with Rosie for her routine vaccination. The receptionist was very cold and not hospitable. We arrived 20 min. early, yet still waited another 20 min. for her to get seen. Tech and Dr. where GREAT!!! Upon leaving and scheduling Rosie's surgery the same receptionist proceeded on giving us instructions for surgery appt.  With a harsh tone of voice reminded us about missed appointments!!! Yes I DID call and rescheduled 3 times due to death in the family. I'm very dissatisfied and disappointed this time. We will have Rosie's surgery there, but will not return to that location.
5	I've never had a bad experience with Banfield. Everyone that works there absolutely loves animals. You can tell that the pets come first, but they are considerate to the needs of owners as well. I recently had a vaccination for my dog scheduled, and several emergencies came in before my appointment. They gave my dog a rawhide to munch on while we were waiting and offered me a glass of water. Wow! I will never go to another vet!
