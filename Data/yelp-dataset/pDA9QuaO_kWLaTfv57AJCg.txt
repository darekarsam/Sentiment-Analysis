4	A and w is, and always will be, the place to go for root.. beer. But their burgers and other fast food offerings are still pretty good. They now serve sweet potato fries, thick cut onion rings, and homestyle fries . They also happen to be my favourite fast food place for breakfast.
3	Thus far, I have had inconsistent experiences with this particular A&W. My first visit was unremarkable, and I mean this as a relatively positive thing. It was exactly as I expected, the food tasted like A&W food should and the service was reasonably polite and quick. My visit for breakfast this morning was also satisfactory. The egg on my English muffin tasted very fresh and looked much more natural than the round or square pucks i'v had at other places. The hash brown was a little oily, but not too salty, and the coffee was *ok* (but not great).My interim visit to this location was quite different. The service, although polite and friendly, seemed slower than it should have been. The counter person seemed a little stressed, and they seemed to to be having some trouble communicating in the prep area and pushing out the orders. I also noticed that their pep person did not wear gloves while assembling the order. We also realized once we where 2 blocks away, that the plain burger we ordered was slathered in condiments, despite the prep person being specifically told twice that the burger was to be plain (just the meat and the bun). We turned back to have it replaced. That being said, despite the initial trouble, they apologized, replaced the burger and told my daughter they would give her a free meal next time (although it was a verbal promise... No voucher or anything...)
4	First time eating A&W..... Simply amazingly fresh. The beef was real tender and juicy, it was actual meat. We ate the combo of 2burgers for 6$ made to a combo for about 10$, overall very good fast food. Establishment was a bitndirty but didn't care too much for I was enjoying my meal.
