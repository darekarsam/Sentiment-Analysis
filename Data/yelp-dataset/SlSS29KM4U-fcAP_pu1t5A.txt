5	Absolutely fantastic place! It's probably the best place I've been in Montreal for burgers. It's a small little restaurant and if you're in the neighborhood or on the plateau, it's worth a little walk. Great place and the 5 stars are completely worth it.
5	With the proliferation of chic burger joints in the city, I was very happy to discover this unpretentious little gem of a restaurant in a secluded corner of the Plateau. All I needed that cold Saturday evening was a burger and a poutine, and I must say they filled my cravings with flying colours. My burger was well put together, held its shape even towards the end, when usually burgers start to fall apart, and it was daaaahlicious. I can't remember the name of the burger, but it was the one with a strip of bacon in it. The poutine also made my heart sing, for they were crispy in all the right places, sweet in the right degrees and covered in just the right amount of gravy. As for my husband's order, he had a plate of boulettes d'agneau topped with feta and emmenthal cheese. and he loved it. The restaurant atmosphere was also cosy and being away from the hustle and bustle of Mont-Royal Avenue, I felt a bit like in a small town's greasy spoon, which was a sweet feeling. At the end of the meal I said to myself, why haven't I been here earlier?
