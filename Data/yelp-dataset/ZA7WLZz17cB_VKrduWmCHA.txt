5	Really like this gym.  I used to be a member at the Y and not that there is anything wrong with it, it just got old.  This gym is smaller but its perfect for me.  The equipment is up to date life fitness , is super clean and it always smells good in there. The gym is open 24/7 which is nice, I dont feel rushed to leave when I workout in the evening.  Plus there isnt a TON of people everywhere! I never have to wait on a machine and most of the time I will be the only person in there! Love that!  The owner David is really nice and accomodating.  Love this place!
5	I would just like to let everyone know how well run this gym is, especially when compared to others. It's an absolute pleasure to workout here on a daily basis. The facilities are spotless and well maintained. Dave, the owner, should be commended on how he operates his establishment. I have been to a few other gyms, including other Anytime Fitness facilities, and to say they pale in comparison to this one would be the understatement of the year. Most people generally take the time to review an establishment when they have something negative to say so I thought I would buck the trend and take the time to recognize something positive. Kudos to you and thank you!!!If you are looking for a clean, well maintained, classy establishment to workout, look no further!!
5	I love this place ....its my newest find !! Thanks to a friend I joined about a month ago. It just works if you know what I mean. Small but not over-crowed ,clean, with great equipment.... what more can you ask for .....well just like all the Anytime Fitness locations 24 hours access 7 days a week !
5	Relaxed place to work out with most any fitness items you would need. Owner and staff keep this place wiped down and sanitized all the time. Overall great gym to workout at.
