5	Great service, great fish taco, CHEAP DrINkS!!!
5	Great value, helpful chatty staff, kinda a locals hangout...we are from out of town yet made to feel very comfortable. Fish tacos were good not great, but everything else was perfect. If you're looking for something other than the overpriced strip stuff, Charlie's could be on your list!
1	Me and my girlfriend went there yesterday we had fish and chips food was excellent the service was good but the problem was when I check my bank statement they charge more than what the slip was I did call back the restaurant give my name to the girl and waited for the manager to call me no response yet.
