5	The service from this company is outstanding. They do a thorough job and highly recommend them for their services. I've already referred family and friends and will definitely be contracting with them again in the future.
5	This year's allergy season has been the worst one for me yet. Arizona is one of the dustiest places I'd ever lived, sinus infections were seeming to be never ending. They were causing serious pain and additional strain on my finances due to missing time from work because of illness, doctors appointments, and prescriptions. My primary doctor made the suggestion of getting my ducts cleaned so that at least I could possibly have some comfort at home. A friend gave me the number for Honest Guys because she'd used them. Needless to say, they came in and were very efficient. It's been about 2 months since they did there service and the air quality in my home is still optimum. Thank you Honest Guys for doing what you do!
5	I had a great experience with this company. Showed up on time, manually cleaned and disinfected my ducts and made my home smell fresh. You could also tell they take pride in their work.
