5	This is a great shop. Its really helped by the fact its independant so, as i understand it, they can stock whatever they want without being told by a wider company what they've to stock. Although it's called Vino it's very much a wine / ales / lager / cider / whisky / spirits shop and, from what i can see, everything is good quality and fairly priced. Im more into beers than wine but the one time i bought some wine i was given really useful and friendly advice and it turned out to be spot on. In terms of beers i'd have to say its surprisingly excellent. The range is fairly focused on Scottish beers which is great to see but they also have a good selection of UK and foreign beers, some fairly hard to get hold of so i've been impressed with that.I'd like to continue to support them and hope other do too as its a local business and seems very customer focused rather than necessarily driven by the bottom line which is great to see nowadays and is a very welcome addition to the likes of Appelation Wines and Cornelius.
4	A decent enough off-license, but blanket 5 star reviews is perhaps going a bit overboard. I can see how Gibson is grateful for getting weaned off the White Lightning, and how the mysterious Calum R is grateful for a store whichshares his enthusiasm for more leftfield brews, it isn't all that mindblowing in my opinion.It does have a good selection, especially when it comes to the foreign beers which are my main point of interest, and despite the slightly pretentious name it feels a bit less wanky than many of the other businesses on the increasingly nauseating Broughton Street. Deep down it is really just an offy though.
