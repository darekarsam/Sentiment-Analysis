5	This is a review for Ray Izadyar - mechanic who works at Autos Unlimited.I cannot emphasize enough what a great mechanic Ray is. As a woman, especially in Las Vegas, finding someone to replace the clutch in my car was nerve-wracking. I went to Ray on recommendation. Immediately I was at ease. Ray is friendly and genuine. He explained to me exactly what was going on with my car. He was not condescending, but he made sure I understood what was going on. He gave me at estimate that was a range of potential costs.When I dropped my car off, he told me exactly when it would be finished (one day!!). When I picked it up, the cost was at the very low end of his estimate.Oh and I must add - his cost was half what Honda quoted me. The car runs like a top now.Ray is the BEST.
1	Auto Unlimited is the worst car dealership I have ever had to deal with. They break the law and the owner is a terrible person. I bought a car that pulled to the right, during the purchase I told the salesman that I would not buy the car if it pulls to the right. So he assured me that they would take care of it. After they looked over the car twice the problem was not fixed and the owner said tough shit I am not helping you. The car also has a DTC for a sensor that came on 2 days after I bought the car. I checked and they cleared the code right before I bought the car. THAT IS AGAINST THE LAW!! Never ever go to this dealership, They lie just to get you to buy a car.
5	I have done business with this dealership for over 30 years, and have sent many friends and family there. They are a cut above the rest, it has been my experience that they not only offer a very fair price, but frequently ignore the 'as is' and help customers with issues when they have no legal obligation to do so....duh, something has kept them in business so long...highly recommend!
