5	First of all this bank is very close to my home. Which makes it most good!!   2ndly they are always very friendly. Every time i have come in if there is the slighest bit of a line they ask you right  away, what can they help you with. This comes from those working on the side lines. This is the only bank i have  ever seen do this.   Every one here is very helpful and very friendly. They will print up your statements even no charge. Extra parking in bank. It is located right on the corner. Good choice if you are in Tempe.
4	Had to withdraw some quick cash today . . . Friday you know.  So I ran over quick to this location (which I have fequented before), to grab the funds . . .As always, the employees were cheerful, courteous, and didn't try to offer you any unneed services.  Three people ahead of my, and guess what . . . Three tellers . . . the visit was quick . . . and I was outta there.Nothing worse than going to the bank and spending 20 - 30 minutes in line . . . only complaint . . . I wish the withdrawal limit at the drive-thru was higher . . . if I only wanted a couple hundred dollars, I would have used the ATM.
