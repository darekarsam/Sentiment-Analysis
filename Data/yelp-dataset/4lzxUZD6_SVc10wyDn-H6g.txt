5	I ordered Pad Thai only slightly spicy, since I'm a spice pansy.  The food was delicious and the service extra quick and polite.  It is fairly new, so no big crowds yet either. (But that will probably change)
3	I ordered Red Curry with beef from the lunch specials.  It had lots of fresh vegetables, good quality beef, and a delicious red curry sauce that was just the right level of spicy (I ordered a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10).  My friend had chicken pad thai (spicy = 9), which she said was very good.  The space is pleasant and clean, and there are lots of booths.  My only issue is that with a fairly busy (not packed) dining room, there seemed to be only one waitress and she was quite busy.  We had a bit of a delay in getting our check.  Hopefully they will increase the staffing a bit to account for the downtown lunch rush.
5	Lunch may be crowded and a bit slow as they get organized, but at dinnertime last Saturday, the restaurant was empty.  I've eaten here twice now and think it's a great find.  We had the sushi boat.  There was more than enough for two and all of it was super-fresh and delicious. Park right around the corner on the side street.  .
3	Tastes great, amazing food, quick service. But they do NOT follow their "Open" hours. Very inconvenient..Just an update; they have changed titles and ownership- they now go by Chile Noodle. This review does NOT apply to the new location- I haven't been there yet.
2	The food was disgusting, waited 45 mins to even get our waters,  and my pas thai tasted like it came frozen out of a carton from trader Joe's.  Not good.
