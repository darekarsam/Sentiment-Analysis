5	In an area of town dominated by low quality tourist trap eateries, The Little Inn, and it's sister branch up near the castle, provide a rare sanctuary of decent, affordable food aimed more at local punters than 60 year old Norwegians with sandals and white socks.Owned by a chap called Fred, who's become a bit of a legend among local office workers, it's just really your usual lunchtime and breakfast selection on offer. It's all very tasty, but it's more the homely atmosphere, New York Dolls on the stereo, and comical but fun sense of organised chaos when it gets busy, that combine to ensure I keep coming back.Fred's cappucino is excellent, and he sprinkles loads of chocloate on top. It's a must.
