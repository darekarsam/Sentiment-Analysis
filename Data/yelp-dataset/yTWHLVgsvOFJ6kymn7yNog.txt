2	I think it broke my stomach.The only reason they can call it Salad Cafe is that they have salads. The salads are not good. The ingredients are not fresh. It's as if someone took the lettuce, tomatoes and other toppings of a Subway and decided that that constituted acceptable salad ingredients. I don't understand how they can claim to have a "California Salad" if it doesn't have avocado! It was supposed to have kalamata olives (implying nice, black, possibly pitted) but instead came with the weird canned kind.Mediocrity incarnate. Avoid.
5	I love this place!  My favorite is the Chicken Caesar Wrap.  The owners are always so friendly and kind.  Everything is always fresh and tastes wonderful!!  I highly recommend this place if your downtown.
3	The quality and options are great but a little too expensive for what you get. You'll be eating a better sub than you'd get from subway or Quiznos but you'll definitely pay for it. Also, if you want to add an extra vegetable or any other topping to your salad, be prepared to shell out about $1.25 per. Overall a pretty good lunch option if you're not on a super tight budget.
5	I was famished after a meeting downtown and their sign drew me in! I had a Cajun tuna toasted flatbread sandwich - Holy cow! It was the most absolutely delicious thing I've tasted in a long time! I'm trying to find reasons to get my butt back downtown to have an excuse to stop here. Such friendly people too! Thanks for a great experience, I'll see you soon!
