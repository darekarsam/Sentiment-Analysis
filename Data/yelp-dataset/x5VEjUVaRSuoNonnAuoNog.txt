3	Went here because it's associated with Floyd Mayweather. Cute spot, kind of a tourist attraction, but a bit pricey. Not a plus size store by no stretch if the imagination. I'm really into customer service and perhaps I may have bought something if it were a bit more genuinely welcoming. I'd give them another try I'm totally down for small businesses and #girlpower
2	Was excited to visit Devanna Love, Its important to patronize Black establishments...I do have to say my 1st experience wasn't so good, When I entered the store I didn't see anyone, then after a few minutes a young lady stuck her head out of the dressing room and said hello, I thought she was a customer since she was trying on clothes during regular business hours, Nor was she very friendly. Customer service is the main KEY to a successful business.
1	Horrible service.   The girl working the front just doesn't care devanna.  She didn't greet us nor help with anything.  WE greeted her.  She was too busy on the iPad checking her facebook or Instagram.  Hopefully she was on here reading the comments.  Anyway devanna.  You need to invest into new employees
