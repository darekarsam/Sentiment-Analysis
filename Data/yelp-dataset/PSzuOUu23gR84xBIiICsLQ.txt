5	I've been going to see Dr. Brigham for some time and I'm constantly reminded of how big of a difference there is in his practice compared to other ones. His management  truly makes all the difference. The girls are great and they've always explained everything to me in addition to being gentle. I love this place!
5	Absolutely wonderful service. The office staff is so great and Dr.Brigham is so good with whiney patients like me who fear the orthodontist office. I would recommend him to anyone.
5	Dr. Brigham is the guy to see if you're looking to improve your smile. He enrolled me in Invisalign and 18 months later, I now have a perfect smile. This practice is in a prime location. Upon entering, you'll notice the upscale environment immediately. You can check in independently via a console upfront, but the staff upfront got to know me by name, so, they would normally just check me in without effort on my part. They use the best technologies available, too. His crew is another reason why this place is great; they make you feel so happy to be there. I really enjoyed my visits as they often turned into a social pow-wow. Besides being friendly, the employees here are highly skilled. Many of them are furthering their education in dentistry school. Very smart gals. Between the professionalism, pricing, experience, and results, I would HIGHLY recommend going here for your ortho needs. In fact, just stop reading and call them now. You won't be disappointed.
