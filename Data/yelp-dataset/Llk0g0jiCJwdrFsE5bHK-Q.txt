3	The community manager (Donnell) is really awesome, he is willing to do what it takes to make u happy with their homes. Our Realtor (Sandra) is a really unorganized but nice.
3	Meh. I feel like maintenance just puts a band aid on everything and doesn't truly fix problems. Community is no longer gated, which was one reason we were willing to live here.
3	This place isn't aweful, but not good either. I have lived here for almost 2 years and can say they do take care of stuff in a timely manner when called. With that said, the self help place is never open. For example, I went there yesterday to get a weed eater and lawn mower and they weren't there. Yes this was during posted operating hours too. When they are open they don't have enough equipment for you. It's either broken or already loaned out. There's hardly ever any security, and the grounds keeper sucks. Especially on the octillio manor side. There's a walk/running path with tree branches in the way and they never pick up the trash that gets blown around during storms. This place isn't horrible, just not up to the standards of a military installation.
