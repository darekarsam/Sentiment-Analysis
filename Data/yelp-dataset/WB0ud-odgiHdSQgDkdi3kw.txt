5	Always always always very happy with Kendra's work.  She is amazing & I will never leave her.
4	Decent prices, large salon. You get a shampoo with each haircut at no additional price. My only complaints is that when I left I had hair all over me.
5	Heather did my hair and OMG she was VERY PATIENT & truly listened to what I wanted & actively tried to help me troubleshoot what I was unsure of. I've had the same hairstyle for FOREVER (20 years) & I was truly scared to let someone i didn't know do my hair. I'm S OOOO GLAD I met Heather. THANK YOU!
