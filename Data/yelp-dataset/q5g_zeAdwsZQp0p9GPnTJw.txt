5	Old-times feel, but they have awesome hoagies, great pizza, and very good italian food.They do deliver, and pretty much anything on the menu is able to be ordered for delivery.  The drinks are by the can or by the 2-liter.In-store, you place the order and they'll either hand it to you at the counter or bring it out to you.  There is very limited seating.You can call in your order and pick it up, too.Definitely would recommend.
5	This place is the bomb.  Great hoagies.  Great pie.  Fair prices.  Cheap delivery.  I have had a LOT of pgh pizza over the years, and this is a solid non-chain joint.  The sandwiches are fantastic. Probably skip the wings or anything fried, to be honest though.  Cheesebread is fantastic.It's WELL worth a try folks.
