3	Maybe i've been yelping for too long...Ok.This place cleans you're dog for you. Not like you do in the bathtub, they do it in Salon chairs. With Special doggy shampoo, that will make all the other dog's jelous.The scariest part is, I saw one of the staff talking away to the dog as she was grooming...like having a conversation with it.Not for me.

Still, when I saw this place I felt I had to let the world know about it - a wierd place where you're pooch can be pampered, even though it might not be too happy about it.
