2	it's a small inexpensive bar that offers the standard fare (beer, wine, rum & coke drinks), coffee and i believe food too (bagel)if you're looking for anything fancy, this is not the place. the place is usually empty with the occasional crowd for special events. it's more crowded during summer as the terrace is open thoughthe only redeeming factor for me is the inexpensive price and the hospital on the other side of the street in case something were to happen
5	Tres cool! Figo!This is a very cool, little-known place with tasty food, cheap (good) wine, and very friendly staff. Johnny & co.'s friendly, trilingual (French, English, Italian) greeting immediately warms you to the place. Their thin crust pizza is wonderful! Ask for the *salsa piccante* that brings a *Blue* (sorta Gorg) pizza to new heights! Their house wine is a fine accompaniment to the pizza and their *caffe'* can close out the meal with a satisfied smile. The place is friendly (locals drop by for a quick coffee and chat about the last Habs game), clean, and has a warm feeling in the afternoon. We'll be back asap. Once the *terrasse* opens, we'll be shading ourselves under one of their patio umbrellas with pizza and house wine while the Vespa cools down after all the local food shopping! C'est tres cool, la' ... e di una fighezza particolare! "
1	This place looks DIRTY!!!!!!!! The staff seems miserable and a bother. Not to mention the barmaids serving can only understand french and look desperate, and I dont mean only for that job. Owner should invest a little to get this place up to date. The clientele is loud and abnoxious and take all the room. Wanted to sit on the terrasse, which is infront of a busy 2 way street, and not inside with the smell. The food is not even worth paying for since I could have probably made better, Should have just gone to the Subway but it was right across from the Jean-Talon Hospital. This place is GHETTO and dirty in more ways than 1. Don't even bother
