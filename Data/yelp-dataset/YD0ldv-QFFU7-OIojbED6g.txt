4	Dined at Cebu Inasal at least 4x last week--breakfast (twice), lunch and dinner. The food was excellent, well presented and just yummy. Great service by the very friendly staff! The place (including the bathroom) was very clean, I highly recommend this place!And oh, btw-their yummy leche flan is sooo cheap for a perfect single serving size!
2	So the family was really excited for this place to open and we really wanted this place to be our next "go to Filipino restaurant" Unfortunately, it will not be a usual spot for us. We ordered the lumpia Shanghai, dinuguan, chicharron bulak, pork bbq on a stick and pancit Bam-i. The bbq on a stick and pancit were both delicious. However when we placed our order for the lumpia , we asked how many pieces in an order. We were told twelve. When my mom picked up the order, they showed her what we had ordered, she counted 9. Their excuse was it's because the pieces were cut big. My mom, didn't bother to say anything. But excuse me, if the lumpia was cut into the twelve pieces, they would have been only one bite lumpias. Regardless, that should have not been an excuse.Next up, the chicharron bulaklak, we asked for it to be extra crispy. What we got was crumbs, maybe 5 small pieces of soggy chicharron soaked up will oil. The dinuguan, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.With the amount we paid for the amount of food that we received, we could have gotten a lot more and better quality at another Filipino restaurant that we frequent.
3	Its alright place, the cashier is kinda loud, server are really slow. I ordered the inasal na chicken and it has alright taste nothing exciting. Then my friend ordered tapsilog its ight too. The eggroll kinda taste like its burned. The desert leche flan is sooo small.
