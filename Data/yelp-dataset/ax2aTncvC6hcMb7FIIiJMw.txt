5	Every time I've been here even during busy season the holidays, the service has always been fast and with a smile.  I will continue to use this store when I have packages, faxing or whatever I may need.
3	Service is okay, but this location's notary never seems to be there when I have something to be notarized. I recommend the Ann and Camino location instead for notary services.
1	We shipped a package at this store and there was a problem with the package.  When we checked the UPS website it states the package was damages and someone would contact us.  5 days later and no one has called us so we contacted this store.  The woman we spoke with was rude and would not help us.  She said they would be in contact with us in a few weeks.  When we asked to talk to the manager the woman  on the phone said no.Very rude people work here and do not care about customer service at all.
3	Come early...or you'll be in line forever.
5	Alonda was very helpful and super nice! she helped my boyfriend and I print some important documents and was very personable. will definitely be returning for our Shipping/ printing needs!
