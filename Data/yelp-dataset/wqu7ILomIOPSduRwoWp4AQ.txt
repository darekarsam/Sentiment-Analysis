1	We went on a weeknight.  Place was not busy waited over 20 minutes for drinks and to have our order taken.  We ordered an app and it came out with the meals and that was another 20 minutes or so.  Food was luke warm at best.  I would not go back.
4	Went for breakfast on 6/16/14. We received very good service and meal came within a few minutes.Waitress could have smiled more but was friendly. I had a Grand Slam... it was more than enough food. Meal was very tasty... We will definitely go back. It is a popular Denny's.
5	I love their stakes and i come here every week just to get the t bone steak, it is completely delicious! Great atmosphere, there is always a lot people and the waiters are nice; food portion is great as well!
5	Perfect time with hubby, after work which is 4 am and you can still have a hot nice meal, waitress was such an adorable girl. Her arm was broken or smth but she still dis a great job!Strawberry lemonade was just smth i have been craving for for so long but did not know what it was :) Strawberry milkshake, nachos and t bone steak is smth we never stop ordering!Its always nice when u go late at night like us, it is not crowded, not noisy, nice music playing and always nice people around. If you want smth quick and it is late at night then i would say Denny's!
5	This location never disappoints!! Food is always consistently great, and if you come at the right time, (witching hours) you may see the cook singing and dancing along with the music in the back. And it is awesome! ! Love this place!!
