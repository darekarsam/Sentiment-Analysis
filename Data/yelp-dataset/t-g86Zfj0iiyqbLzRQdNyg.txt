4	I love Cracker Barrel they have something for everyone. Service is always friendly just once we had a problem where we had to move from our original table because they sat us down accidentally then they took over 8 min for us to get our drink order taken. We had to get the managers attention. That will still not change my mind about how awesome this place is. We completely stopped going to IHOP and Denny's this place is so much better. Their blue berry muffin is one my favorites. Their pancakes are made out of cratch! I mean you don't get that out of a franchise.  It feels very cozy and welcoming.
5	For a chain restaurant focusing on Southern comfort food, Cracker Barrel is as good as it gets.  You get quality food, reasonable prices, great service, a shop in the front where you can buy candy, souvenirs, and tchochkes, along with friendly,  sort of down home, roadside atmosphere.  Those of you from CA need to stop at a Cracker Barrel while you're in AZ as there aren't any at home.  Not every Cracker Barrel is created equal, and the service at the Buckeye location knocks the socks off the one in Goodyear. I had the grilled catfish, potato casserole (cheesy potatoes), fried apples, and biscuits.  Everything was excellent and the catfish portion was bigger than I've found at other locations.  If you open up your biscuit and put some of the fried apples on there you've made yourself a biscuit apple pie.  Oh yeah!
4	Came to visit my pops and he suggested this place, well done, well done. . I recommend the campfire beef,  seasoning was exquisite on the meat and veggies.  My dad got the granola pancakes I was impressed. The decor is lovely,  antiques everywhere and cozy ambience. I also like their little store good knick knacks and candy. The only bad thing was we waited a while for our food, the waitress was nice it just seemed a forever wait to indulge our food. Will definitely come back :)
5	My husband and I had a great lunch here as we passed through town. I had the chicken campfire meal and my husband had the chicken BLT both were super tasty and served up quick and hot. We will stop here again anytime we pass through.
4	Always yummy
1	Never again! Worst breakfast and service. Burnt food, cold food, incompetent manager.
4	I had just arrived at my friends place in Arizona and was hungry after the 5 1/2 hour drive.   My friend suggesting a few places to eat, but there are few options in Buckeye, AZ and Cracker Barrel is the only one that sounded good.   I'd heard of Cracker Barrel but never been, so this was my chance.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#OxMsiZSZZirWcIyF4cK2EQWe walk towards the front door and past a bunch of rocking chairs.   Anyone up for a game of checkers?  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#PGEF5EAJo5qhMJOngYbbxAThe front door.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#y7qIOF2AHtS6EFjJ7AKUVwWe walk in and what a surprise...  a country store inside!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#c-haZxlixRhVcchfMsCb0AWe're taken into the dining room and seated.   Yessiree Billy-Bob, if this ain't country, I don't know what is!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#sRuGjwo7Pn78W7CL3EaPogSERVICE:  Our server Deana was pretty awesome.  Very friendly, always with had smile and not far away if we needed anything, including a beverage refills we never had to ask for.   The food came out of the kitchen in a timely manner as well.FOOD:  After looking over the large menu of southern comfort fixin's, I decided on the Fried Chicken Salad ($8.69), a side of Mac & cheese ($2.59) and a side of the "Hash brown casserole" ($2.59).   My friend ordered the chicken tender sandwich platter ($8.49).My salad was good as salads go.   Crisp lettuce, crispy chicken tender pieces, grape tomatoes, cheese & croutons.   Simple, but tasty overall and really hit the spot!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#z6-H47IpF9u2nPk3QuEhIQMac & cheese = ooey, gooey, creamy & cheesy.... Pretty tasty and more flavor than just melted Velveeta.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#DFuHeGdidUkXxC5-qBA9MgI had to try the Hash brown casserole because "it was there".  Very cheesy and oniony, it's quite rich, but quite tasty!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#tba2M2j_hNS77K2TVaflCwMy friend said his open faced chicken sandwich (w/fried rather than grilled chicken) was very good, though he didn't eat any of the corn bread and apple butter that came with it.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#HrYnebcGZiuIR2jAzi_yhwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#NmgWAszQaw1pN0_bEwy-UgOVERALL:  Nice place and friendly service, for when you want those down home country vittles in a VERY down home country environment.... 3.5 stars rounded up!
