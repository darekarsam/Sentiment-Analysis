5	I don't know which flavor kettle corn is more addictive.  If you like spice, Cayenne Lime will tickle your taste buds.  Regular and Cinnamon Sugar are great for those who are less adventurous.  I haven't tasted the new Chipotle Cheddar and White Cheddar, but I'm looking forward to it.  If kosher is important, Kettle Heroes will suit you.  I especially love how two brothers started this company, and give 20% to charities like the Boys and Girls Clubs of Phoenix and the Pat Tillman Foundation.  It's available at most Basha's stores in Arizona, and online at their website or on Amazon.com
5	Holy yumminess! Great popcorn made by great people! I got 4 bags of the Cayenne Lime Kettle Corn because I fell in love with it at first bite, and I'm still just as much in love with it as I was before. I definitely recommend this popcorn to anyone thinking about trying it!
5	We usually pick up some of this popcorn at the Gilbert Farmers Market. I usually get the plain because it is that good.  My husband, who does not like popcorn at all likes this popcorn.  I have also tried the Cayenne Lime and the regular kettle corn.  All are really good.
5	Very helpful people and yummy kettle corn!  You can tell they genuinely care about making a super high quality product.  Thank you!
