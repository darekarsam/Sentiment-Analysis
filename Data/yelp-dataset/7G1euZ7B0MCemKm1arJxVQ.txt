5	Suzanne was great to work with!  I explained to her the goal of the balloon structure and she made it tangible, as a true artist would.  She was flexible and willing to work within my budget.  She is extremely creative and I was very impressed with her work. Her delivery was prompt and she was a pleasure to work with!
5	I've been looking for a balloon arrangement to surprise my wife on her birthday because she loves balloons. I found Sin City Balloons here on yelp and why not give them a shot and I'm so glad I did. I spoke with a woman (I'm sorry I suck with names) and she was very helpful. I wasn't sure of what arrangement I wanted to get for my wife and the lady that helped me over the phone was very professional. She guided me through her website of different designs to give me ideas and found the one. Also added on extra balloons on the design and fudge for a surprise. Extremely smooth process and promised her I'd leave a review. Thank you again.
5	I love balloons! And this company makes the best most beautiful bouquets! If you need decorations that are over the top they are the right choice! The owner is very kind and always professional.
