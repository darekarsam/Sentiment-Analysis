4	Pottery Barn is known for its simple, yet classic style. It has a great location in the South Park Mall. The store is large, but it can be tricky getting around in there since it's stocked wall to wall with items. Great bedding, house accessories, and dinnerware. I'm in love with some bath accessories and saving my dollars to get the set. If you are shopping to update your living space, make a stop here.
4	Really helpful employees. Dennis helped me out on a few different occasions with ordering lamps and shades that they didn't have in stock. He was super friendly through the entire process.
4	With my Mom recently relocating to Charlotte we were on a hunt for a few items. The staff at Pottery Barn was welcoming and assisted w/ our questions & order. Great customer service and obviously a great variety of home selections, from candles and frames to rugs and furniture...a great spot as we walked away w/ a few bags and a shipment to be delivered by the 10th.
5	I shopped at Pottery Barn over the 2014 Holiday Season.  The selection was top of the line. The sales associates were very helpful and courteous.  Great Staff which always helps the shopping experience.
