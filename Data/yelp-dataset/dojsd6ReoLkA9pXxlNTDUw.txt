2	I have a hard time passing up a Chinese Buffet but in this case I probably should have. The food was ok, and the place was tiny! As a business traveller I eat alone a lot and this lends itself to eaves droping. I don't make a point of it, but in a place as small as this it was impossible not to. One of the conversations was a late forty guy with a grey shag explaining a situation where Jackie Chan couldn't remember his lines and what a bad actor he was to an Asian woman that just ate and looked beyond him.  Another table was three rather loud late 20 early 30 something women talking about back in the day. Now I am 57 and I don't say things like that cause my parents are in there 90s an I figure I am just now living those back in the day times. So unless you like listening to others conversations and a limited variety you should pass.
2	Cheap food fast is the best way to describe this place.  I understand the the concept of a buffet and you basically serve yourself.  But to be bombarded before you even sit down with questions from the servers is a bit irritating.  Like they already know what you are going to order, so there is really no need for a ton of questions.The food is mediocre at best.  It's not gourmet for sure, but it will do.  Buffet size wise, it's a bit on the small side.  So you get the basic Chinese fare, but nothing extravagant.  You will get full here, but you may not feel all that great afterwards.
3	China Buffet and China Garden are one in the same, CG is a portion of the restaurant for take out and delivery while CB is obviously a sit down and serve yourself buffet. I really don't have any complaints, as a vegetarian this place satiates my hunger pangs. Veggie lo mein, egg foo young, peppery fried potatoes, veggie egg rolls, mac and cheese, sauteed mushrooms, string beans and mixed veggies are always hot and tasty.
