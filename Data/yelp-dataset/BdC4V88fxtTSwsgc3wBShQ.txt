5	Walked out feeling great again today:) Love the $55 a mth deal for 4 visits & they are open on Sundays. I have a bulged disk & need regular care. Misty asks me every visit how I feel & takes that into consideration during her adjustments. It's more than a 5 minute out the door adjustment done w/ the  same procedures w/ previous offices I've been too. I love her recommendations for after care & how I feel instantly after adjustments. I sleep better, feel better & know I'm spending so little on weekly adjustments to make me feel great! Highly recommended:)
