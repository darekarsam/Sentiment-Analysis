5	Le fish'n ship est tout simplement sublime et les pommes de terre grecque succulente!!!
5	Every time i come to visit my parents i`m guaranteed to come here. If not i feel disappointed.I seem to always get the one piece fish & chips special.For $15 you get a choice of soup of the day (usually 3 kinds),Bread, your fish comes with choice of potato and coleslaw. And about 15 desert choices.Face it you can't go wrong with that. The portion is filling and everything is as tasty as it comes.The fish is lightly rolled in a light breadcrumby mixture. You wouldn't call it battered since it isn't and fried so light that i can't even say it's fried.So obviously it's not greasy.Be prepared to see a lineup on any night but they process people so fast and have plenty of seating it would be rare that you have to wait more than 15 minutes. Besides since it's Quebec the odds are that you'll end up in conversation with the others waiting with you.Top notch service, quality food, can't wait for my next visit to come back here again!
