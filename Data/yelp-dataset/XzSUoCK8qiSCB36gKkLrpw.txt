3	Peek-A-Boutique is relatively new, I believe the man working at the time said less than a year, maybe 4-6 months. The shop had a lot of unique items that were interesting. I did see a dress and some jewelry that interested me, but the dress wasn't my size and I was just looking. I did like the ambiance, Frank Sinatra playing in the background, rat pack t-shirts hanging on a wall nearby. It was a cute little store. If I'm in the area I may stop by, seems like they'll have something different every time you come in.
1	Absolutely terrible!!! I waited for 20 minutes to even get soaked for my pedi and then after an hour had passed and no one came to attend to me I just asked for a towel and left. I can't believe I wasted an hour just sitting there soaking my feet expecting that the lady would come and work on my nails. Do no go here, period!
5	For my first time getting my feet done . I must say my experience was very pleasant. My nail tech POOH was highly experienced n educational on foot care. Guys if looking to get a good service ask for POOH, she the best.
