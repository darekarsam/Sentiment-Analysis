4	Who knew that there could be a line before the place opens? Clearly this type of clinic fills a need in the community! Friendly, caring staff, the perfect sized operation for those things in life that need medical attention but don't warrant a visit to the ER or that should wait for days or more to get into a primary care doc.
4	The PA's really listen and do their best to take care of their patients. I've only ever had a long wait once or twice and have been coming here for at least 5 years.They always take my insurance (I've changed at least 3 times since I started coming here) and they handle my whole family. My husband works nights so it is difficult for him to get in at his Doctor...but he can always be seen here.
5	This place was a Godsend for me - I only have catastrophic insurance, and was looking for a place to deal with an ear problem - this location inside Fry's was perfect - Natalie at the counter was friendly and efficient, and Shannon who solved my problem in a matter of minutes, really knew her stuff and took care of me with professional kindness and confidence. And the price was just right, with no membership or insurance required. Will definitely come back and recommend to my friends and family. Thank you, Little Clinic!!
