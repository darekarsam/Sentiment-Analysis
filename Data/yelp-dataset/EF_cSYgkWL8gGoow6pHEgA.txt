2	This is where I have to come pick up my package when they leave a yellow slip at my residence. I don't like this one- it's packed- the line is out the door, every time I have to come here. I don't understand why this one is the one I have to go to- it's still in the same zip code, I suppose. It's just past Fremont/Boulder near a mobile home community. There are three people at the desk, but the line seems to move so slow. The last time I went, someone in line had really bad BO. Sometimes someone asks if you're there to pick up (yellow slips).
1	Awful place my house has the same number as the other house in the next block and the mail man puts 2 out of 3 packages at the other house and when i go to this post office and ask about the package they say he left it in my mail box wat a load of crap!!!! I cant even rely on getting my bills!
