5	I absolutely love this shop!! Sharyl is an outstanding floral designer, so if you need a great arrangement, go for it! She made a lovely centerpiece for my sister's birthday/Thanksgiving last year. And I love that she is going green with reused vases and containers of all kinds. But what you may not know is that the shop itself is full of unique gifts, accessories, and home decor!! The stock is always changing, and it is a joy to browse - you will be certain to find something for the Badger fan, scarf lover, or writer in your life.
5	Sharyl of Promises Floral met with me and two of my sisters to discuss a casket arrangement for my mom when she passed away last October.  She asked us many great questions that helped us to honor our mother for her unique contribution to our lives and to her community via the arrangement.  The end result was a gorgeous rose spray that beautifully adorned her casket.  Her attention to detail and compassion have no limits.  I would recommend Sharyl and Promises Floral for anyone seeking the best possible service and artistic floral expression for their special event.  And the gift shop is awesome, as well!  Great gift ideas!
