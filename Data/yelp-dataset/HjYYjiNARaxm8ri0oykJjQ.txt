5	Sol Yoga is wonderful!  The instructors are fabulous and extremely knowledgeable and precise about poses.The studio is very warm and inviting.  I would recommend it to you!
5	This studio is very well designed, very nice cork floors. The teachers are great. They all have anusara training which is what I look for in a yoga teacher. It's a little hard to find but lucky for me I found it! You will get a good yoga class if you go there. They are adding Zumba too which is always fun! The owner is a very well trained and experienced teacher.
3	... I had only been to one class a year ago ... it was not difficult enough ... it's not power yoga ... it's sort of easy going yoga ...I'm on their email distribution list ... today 8-20-13 received this email:"It has been truly my honor and privilege as the Owner of Sol Yoga over the last seven months ... It is with mixed emotions that I inform you that Sol Yoga will be closing its door on September 15th, 2013."..."If your membership has run out - no worries- you may join us for any of our classes until our last day Sunday Sept 15th. If you would like to make a donation know all of it will go toward the teachers who richly deserve ever penny and a whole lot more. "(signed)Neil Winikoffinfo@solyogaaz.com
