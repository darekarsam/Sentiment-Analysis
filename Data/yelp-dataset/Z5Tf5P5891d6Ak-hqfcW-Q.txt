2	Although the resort was nice, we were severely disappointed in the customer service.  You would think that paying good money for a timeshare would result in a little more attention from the staff.  We complained and the resort manager did offer us a few nights stay for free, however since this place is a 6 hour drive for us I don't know that we will ever be able to use it.  We appreciate him trying to make is right, which is why I won't give them only 1 star.
2	The place is pretty nice so that's not my beef. The service sucks sucks sucks. Over priced for the wrong service and they will not refund anything. Go elsewhere.
4	Had a great time this past weekend with my family.  Nice pool, nice room, i liked the food.  The only complaint I had about the trip had nothing to do with the resort.  Someone could make a fortune putting in a good breakfast place anywhere within 3 miles of there.  It doesn't exist right now.  But outside of that I had a very good time.
2	This is a typical 3 star timeshare "resort".  The bed comfort was ok, there were stains on the carpet.  The lighting was horrible, it was hard to find a decent place to apply makeup.  You are out of luck if you want to see yourself in a full body mirror, as there isn't one.  They must not think that people like to look good on vacation.I also had a mani/pedi, which was very relaxing; however my polish was flaking off the next day.I would stay at a Candlewood Suites over this resort.
