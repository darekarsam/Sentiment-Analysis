4	When I first moved to the Henderson side of town, I needed a new dentist and I have to say it was surprisingly difficult to find one.  So many of the front office staff were unfriendly or acted put out that I wanted an appointment as a new customer (which based on all the hype about the bad economy made me wonder if Dentists are not affected?).But then I found Laser Dental and I love their front office staff.  My dentist is thorough and a little preachy about me not flossing enough, but that is OK.  I just take it with a grain of salt and move on.  Bottom line:  I continue to go there and would recommend them to my friends and family.  Absolute, number one reason? Amazing front office staff - nice, friendly, helpful and concerned!
5	Love the staff of laser dental... they are very professional, always greet you with a smile, helpful,attentive to their patients needs....and would highly recommend it to everyone who is looking for a good/reliable dental clinic..
5	I love Laser Dental :) the front desk staff is awesome and very personable. I started coming here because of the Groupon offer they were having. When I went in for the cleaning, they mentioned my wisdom teeth, which I knew I had to get out soon, and quoted me. It was very reasonable. I don't have insurance and they do everything they can to make it of affordable for me, which I appreciate a lot!
5	I was looking for a new dentist/dental office and found them, I yelped them and saw the reviews and so I made an appointment. The staff is friendly and helpful. I need to get some crowns and I am amazed that I'm not paying an arm and a leg. It's a nice small office and they have tvs in the rooms to help pass the time in the chair.
5	I will never see any other dentist anymore!!! He is the nicest and the best...he does take his time. Not to mention the staff here is superrrrrrr awesome.. I love ANA and ELLEN they are the best. Smile :)
