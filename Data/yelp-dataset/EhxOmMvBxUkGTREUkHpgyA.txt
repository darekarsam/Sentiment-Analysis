5	Mary W. Is awesome at Kokomo! She's been doing my hair for over three years now and I wouldn't ever go to anybody else!  She listens to what you want, explains what she is doing and offers a flexible schedule for her clients. I always get compliments on my hair too!  If you are looking for a great and consistent stylist that knows color, cutting and highlighting, I'd strongly recommend Mary!
5	I lost my previous hairstylist when she moved out of state and her boutique salon closed.   I tried several salons and I couldn't get anyone to listen to my wishes for color or style.  I tried Salon Kokomo based on a Groupon offer and couldn't have been happier with the whole experience.   The receptionist was very accommodating, my stylist, Whitney, was punctual and very pleasant, but most of all she really listed to what I wanted, offered suggestions and gave me great color and a fabulous haircut.    I really wanted something where I could blow dry but didn't have to.  Whitney suggested modifications to the picture I showed her and gave me the perfect cut.  I definitely will be returning!!!  Thanks Whitney.Kari J
