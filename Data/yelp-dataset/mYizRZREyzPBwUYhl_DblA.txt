1	Well had we not been thoroughly hammered my buddies and I would have never even thought to go in here. But the sales pitch we got was pretty convincing... there was a woman (we'd later find out was a prostitute) standing by the door, and as we walked by she flashed her big breasts & said, "Come up and by me a drink!"  How could we refuse..... My guess is that she wasn't actually working FOR the bar, but rather working the guys at the bar.They had a few pool tables, but the place was more of a dive bar then anything else.  We had a couple of rounds with our "new friend" and left after around the 18th time she asked us if we wanted to "go somewhere with her."  And no, she didn't leave with us... she had moved on to the next guy at the bar when we were heading out.
