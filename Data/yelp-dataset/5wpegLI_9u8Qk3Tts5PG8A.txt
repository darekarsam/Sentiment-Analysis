5	I found Massage Pro because I was given a Spa Finder gift certificate and needed to find a place to use it.  I was skeptical at first because their rates are one of the lowest in town and the website is pretty bare bones.  I also couldn't find very many reviews of the place, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I decided to press my luck anyway because they offered medical massages (I suffer from wrist tendinitis), and I am so thrilled that I did!  They are located in a medical office building, so their place is set up more like a doctor's office than a spa, e.g., spartan waiting room.  But the massage rooms are exactly like the rooms found in spas, and are nicer than some other places that I have been to that are more expensive.  My massage therapist, Shanie, is excellent and gives one of the best massages I've ever had!  She really gets down to the deep tissue and gets all of my knots out!  My arms and back feel so much better now, and now I am seriously considering getting regular massages for my health.If you make an appointment, be sure to ask for Shanie!
5	Best in the business. This is my go to when I have in the area. The owner Christina is fantastic. She has such energy and clearly knows what she is doing.  The office is very nice and clean which is important. The prices are fantastic, had to do a double take. Highly recommended!!
