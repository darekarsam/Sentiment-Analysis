1	This place was recommended by our regular auto guy as a place to have our AC looked at. The mechanic (or owner?) was not very friendly throughout interaction. We ended up paying $100 to have the problem diagnosed, which was more than we expected. We were told the air compressor was out, and it would cost $900 to replace. We decided not to have it fixed, and it felt like there was some amount frustration directed towards my husband about that choice.  Here's the reason for the one-star review: My husband gets home, starts googling to see if he can do this work himself. He finds out, that on our model of car -- which is a very common model -- there is one electrical relay that always goes out first on the AC. My husband bought it for $60 on ebay and fixed it himself. AC fixed. I just quite frustrated to consider that we would have put $1,000 into repairs, and it wouldn't have fixed the problem.
5	Archer Auto Repair does fine work. Joe has always been totally honest with us, telling us certain repairs aren't needed when they could have gone ahead and done them and we never would have known the difference.
5	Joe has worked on all of our cars and we always feel like the repair was done correctly and at a fair price.
