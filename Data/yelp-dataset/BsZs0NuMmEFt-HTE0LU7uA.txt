5	Stop here! This place is great lots of items, nicely displayed and clean. Friendly owner(I presume) great vibe. Even found a little treasure!
5	Their tagline is "greed-free prices" and this couldn't be more true! I've been to many vintage boutiques and this one takes the cake. So much to choose from and everything is priced perfectly! Can't say enough good things about this place.
5	Amazing items! Beautifully curated! Unbelievable prices! I wish I had a larger place so I could fill it with unique and quirky items.
5	I try to stop here once a paycheck. Favorite store in town! Definitely worth your time to check this place out. Plus, dexters is across the street.
