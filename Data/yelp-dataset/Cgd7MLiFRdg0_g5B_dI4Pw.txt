1	Watery drinks and average ambiance, my friends and I left after one round and found the front door LOCKED, which I'm sure is against the LAW. I guess they don't want potential patrons seeing how many people flee after one watery drink. We found the exit which was literally a back door down some fire escape stairs and a lovely dumpster that'll make Oscar from Sesame Street cringe. I won't be taking my business here again.
5	Great place!!! Very few people know about this place as it's just on top of McKibbins and most people think the entrance is for the irish pub! Safe to say it's a hidden gem! It has a mixture of everything here; from the music that goes from Biggie Smalls to Michael Jackson to Macklemore and The lumineers!! The people here vary from the trendy club goers to the relaxing hipsters to the Montrealers looking for an escape!! I strongly recommend going!!
