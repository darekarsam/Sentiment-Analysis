4	I went here today to buy a new coat.  The shop is attractively laid out and the staff were very helpful.
4	Expensive? yes. But it is a brand so you know what you can expect. What was my most pleasant experience was how friendly and very service minded they are. Missing a buckle, button or your cuff is torn? They will try to replace all that free of charge! Does Barbour come with a lifetime manufacturer's guarantee? I don't know but their service point to this. The shop is well stocked and you find it reminds you of the country. Gentlemen country. Waxed coats, leather bags, padded undercoats and boots. I only have a bag from them and if I only had more money I would get lots more. Their stuff is quality, proper and timeless. Very pleased.
