5	I contacted Hudson through Yelp to complete a walnut C-Frame and paint-grade cabinet.  I was pleased with the the C-frame cabinet and buffet, and had him help me design and build a solid walnut audio cabinet (pictured on his website) that was executed perfectly.  His pricing is reasonable, and he is very good at managing expectations and understanding needs.  Respectful, timely and a pleasure to work with.  We'll be recommending and/or utilizing his skills again as needed without question.
5	Hudson is a master craftsman.  We have trusted him with projects involving wood refinishing and new cabinetry and every job has been meticulously done at reasonable cost. We highly recommend him and will definitely call upon his services again when needed.
5	Hudson created for me a contemporary built-in cabinet for my SF condo. He created designs for the work, presented me with drawings on which we made a few last-minute additions and only a few days later, he was finished. A few hours of install and I was enjoying our new built-in. The quality of his work is very impressive, Hudson is quite the craftsman.
