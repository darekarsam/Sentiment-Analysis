5	One of my favorite places to be hands down, I look forward to haircuts all week! The barbers are the best, great conversations and haircuts.  Nothing these guys can't do designs are out of this world.  For the best cuts ask for Miguel!!!
4	This place is fun and they do a great job. Every one is welcome there...unless you have thin skin because there is a lot of trash talking and no one is safe. It is sort of like a cross between Cheers and Barber Shop.  I love it.Sadly I moved all the way across town now so had to stop going there though if I am ever back in the neighborhood I WILL stop in.Now, the negs. They do talk about Jesus in there sometimes. Not a lot but it is their opinion and they feel strong about it and like I said there is a lot of debate in there about music, sports, politics, drugs and even Jesus so...Also, sometimes wait times are long. That is the result of them doing a fantastic job and giving full attention to the customer in the chair. Tip them well for the service they give.  Just be warned, it is not a quick in and out there.All that  being said, I miss these guys and strongly recommend them.
