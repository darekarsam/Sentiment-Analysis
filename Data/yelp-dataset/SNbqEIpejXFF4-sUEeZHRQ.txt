4	This is one of my favorite locations in town. They always seem to move faster than a tradition Starbucks.
3	Its Starbucks. Inside the Casino. Coffee was yummy. Exactly what you're expecting when u walk in.
5	The staff is always friendly and they know what I want. It would be better if there were two people on staff all the time. The store is always clean.
