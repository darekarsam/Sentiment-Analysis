5	It's rare for me to add, check-in or review a business within a business, but I'm making an exception for the coffee stand inside the Station Square Sheraton. This is based on two things: Starbucks coffee and friendly, pleasant service. The former needs no explanation but the latter is much appreciated.I've stopped by here each morning for my daily dose of java and the lady working here solo is not only efficient, but always very friendly and polite. She even gave me a complimentary cup of coffee, thanking me for my service (I was in uniform) during my first visit. It's a shame that this type of friendly, upbeat customer service is the exception vs. the rule nowadays.The only minor drawback is there are no standard hours of operation, so you never know when she might step away and close during the day. But it's somewhat expected with one employee doing everything.

3	I stayed at the Sheraton Station Square over the weekend.  I have stayed there many times but this was my first time eating at Station Break.  We had breakfast there, they are a decent menu (a la carte) for breakfast/brunch, and they also have a buffet.  I got the breakfast quesadilla, and a fruit smoothie from the kids menu.  My food was pretty decent.  The quesadilla came with plenty of fresh tomato salsa.Everyone else got the buffet ($15 for adults, $8 kids), and I am very glad that I didn't!!  The eggs looked cold and foul.  The sausage and bacon were sitting in a lot of grease.  The rest of just a continental breakfast.  Typical disappointment on a buffet.  Our server was also very slow and neglectful.  He forgot to bring us several things that we asked for, even after reminding him, he never brought them.
