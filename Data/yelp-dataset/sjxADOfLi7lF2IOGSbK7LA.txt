5	If I hadn't made an effort to visit a friend on this street I would have never known this place existed. It's a small underground furniture store with great surprises and amazing bargains. Most of its furniture are antiques and there is always a good deal to pick up.My friend got this GORGEOUS old trunk suitcase she uses to keep her clothes in. Beats the plastic container boxes by far. They are constantly changing their stock and it's almost like a hidden treasure trove. Well worth a look in if you are in the area!
