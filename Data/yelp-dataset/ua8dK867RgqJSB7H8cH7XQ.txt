1	In any USPS it is always a cluster----. & this place isnt any better.  The service is rude and no-one smiles at all.  We get it that youre  grumpy, but geeez dont need to spread it to me.  The pace of the service is okay, Im sure they want all of us to leave already & noone wants to wait any longer than they should have.    The place doesnt seem very kept/clean (last time I was there). Other than that, I normally avoid this USPS.
1	This has got to be the most ghetto post office I've ever been to. Employees are not very proffesional. The place is so dirty. Place needs a good paint job and scrub down. I understand its not in the best neighboorhood, but keep the place clean for your customers.
3	What can I say about a post office? I usually do shipping from UPS as I have a pick up service that comes to my home.  I ended up getting a P.O. Box here.  I didn't know if I was going to be moving and needed a concrete place to get my mail.  I hate filling out a change of address form.  Plus, you can put your mail on hold if you go out of town, and they will hold your packages.  I had friendly service when I set up my small P.O. Box and was given a run through on how things worked.So, it's just a part of life.  No problems but no expectations either.
1	Beware of Tina!! I understand policies if they were explained at first. But as a government employee stay professional and don't judge because I'm young and think I'm trying to abuse the mail hold policies. Never been treated like a kid before will never go to this location again.
