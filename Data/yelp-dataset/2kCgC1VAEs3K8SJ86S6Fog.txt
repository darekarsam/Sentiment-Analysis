4	good pizza, great price, nice guys
1	Had their pizza last night for my sons sleepover. None of the kids ate it and complained that it tasted metallic. It was indeed pretty horrible even for $5.99 per medium. We will never go near the place again.
4	I really like this place. I get delivery all the time.  I feel like its better than a lot of other chain pizza places. You can order everything from wings to subs and dessert pizza (never had that) The owner or manager, not sure which one is very nice .  Its located in a strip mall near a Harris Teeter.
5	I don't know how this place makes a profit.  The ingredients seem so fresh and prices are very low.  Best pizza crust. Cheap lunch specials too
