5	I've been here well over 50 times and I have never once been dissatisfied with the service or the food/drinks! On a busy day, you never even have to wait too long. The store is always clean and the employees are always so kind, especially the young man that works later on - always brightens up my day with his kindness!
1	Everytime I've gone there the food has been very disappointing. The employees just slap the food together with no care of concern for the customers. Also the coffee was horrible the one time I tried it! The manager is difficult to understand and tries to upsell you on everything! I would not recommend this place.
3	Good for a snack and always got treats at my job. Wish they have powdered sugar donuts without the jam filling in it
