1	It's a beautiful warm pre spring day and nothing sounds better than a DQ blizzard. I passed up dessert at the Iron Bridge for this blizzard. I had never been to this particular DQ, but I figure they are all the same. Boy was I wrong. The service was quick and friendly, but my blizzard was a cup of chocolate ice cream. I couldn't find my peanut butter cups anywhere. With great disappointment, I threw it away. Needless to say, I won't be frequenting this joint, which is a shame because I work down the road.
4	As far as DQ's go this one is pretty nifty.  Brand new facilities with a friendly staff means you can expect clean bathrooms, clean facilities, and awesome ice cream.  They staff is relatively young, so there's a certain space cadet-ness quality to the service, nonetheless, it gets the job done.
