5	I was referred here by a friend after being in a rear end collision. Let me just sayd, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CLINIC!! Dr Fair/Dr Teddy Sim are extremely polite and knowledgeable. Everything was explained to me in detail and I was never pushed into something that wasn't needed for me. I definitely will be coming back on a monthly basis for adjustments!
5	I have been going to Dr. Ted for months and cannot express how thankful I am to be his patient. I've been to other chiropractors before but have not experienced the relief I receive from adjustments like I do when he adjusts me. He has helped the subluxation in my spine to the point in which I no longer experience tinnitus or headaches. When I suffered a back injury and was in so much pain I couldn't touch my toes, Dr. Ted treated my injury. He monitored me closely and made sure I was progressing and showing signs of improvement. He had a plan for me and helped with my recovery without the use of more invasive measures. Dr. Ted is knowledgable, approachable, and cares for his patients. He truly had a steady clientele and has a following of other patients who feel the same way as I do!
5	I was amazed with the physical therapy area, the staff knows the latest and most effective exercises to rehabilitate an injured back after a car accident injury.  Every time I went I never had to wait, very relaxed environment. The doctors are very careful with the adjustments.  They know you are injured so they apply the right amount of pressure.  The doctors explained me exactly what I had and how it would be the recovery process.  XRays are on site so that saved me a trip.  My advice for anybody that goes to the Neck and Back clinic is that please follow their directions, f they tell you to do specific exercises at home or don't allow you to do certain activities, do it.
