1	i used to buy incense here on a bi-weekly basis, because it is damn good. then i bought expensive massage oil here, and when the bottle fell off a table a foot from the ground, it broke. my husband tried to return it and the owner basically accused him of being a liar - they actually 'tested out' a separate bottle by filling it with water and dropping it on the floor. well congrats, assholes, that bottle is not dysfunctional LIKE THE ONE YOU SOLD TO ME WAS. beads and botanicals sucks and i hope it goes out of business. the end.
1	Outright Fraud!!!Do not patronize this business!! On ALL their websites including http://www.wiseweeds.netand ebay store:http://stores.ebay.com/Aroma-from-Wise-Weeds-Botanicals?refid=storethey happily take your money and send you NOTHING!! They will not communicate with you either by phone, e-mail or snail mail, no matter how many times you try. Once you give them your money - it's GONE FOR GOOD!!Bad business practices and bad people - AVOID!!
5	Cute little store. I went in to look for dried sage smudge sticks. They had a wide selection at various price points. I would go back again.
4	I've been here for products (lovely stones, excellent incense, nice candles, essential oils) and for Reiki and Reflexology treatments by Marlita.I've always been happy with my purchases  - the incense and oils that Catherine makes are top quality.Treatments with Marlita are always special.  No matter how I feel going in, I feel much much better coming out!I'm lucky this store is not close to my home -- I'd be there all the time!
