5	Great place for a peaceful drink. Its small but thats its beauty.Try the boot beer if u wana get drunk ...
4	This pub is a cool small hole in the wall place. Come here with a couple of friends if you want a low-key pub where you can get crazy all night! I was here thinking it would be a chill place, but maybe because it was the weekend before St. Patty's Day, but people at this pub were all having a ton of fun, dancing on the floor, and just having a good night. "Pregame" definitely sums up this bar. If you are looking for a place to pregame with your friends, this is it.
5	This place is awesome!  It's a great hangout for the night and the clientele are all wonderful.
