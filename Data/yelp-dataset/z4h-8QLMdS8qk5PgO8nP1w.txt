5	What can I say about version 2. For starters, they actually know their trade. They can tell you what will fit with what, and how to do it. They have the hands on knowledge. They do offer minor repairs/installs. (hid kits, lips, and others depending on how busy they are) and also can special order in parts,wheels and tires within a few days. Plus they are cool people to talk with, every single one of them. Brian, mark, you guys are awesome. Just get more things in for EFs ;).
5	The customer service here is amazing! Contacted then and got back to me same day. These guys know their shit! Super friendly. Highly recommend this place for sure! #CoSign
5	Great service and amazing personalities. As long as you arent trying to low ball them, they will help with pretty much anything you need. Great at what they do.
1	Made an appointment to have my fenders rolled but the guy doing the job is out of town for family reasons. No biggie but made the appointment when he'd be back. I stated that 12 noon was the latest I could bring my car to have the work done. I heard more then once that their garage was full of cars. It made me feel like they weren't interested in my business. So I finally talk to the guy actually doing the work and he wants me to bring my car in to see what hes dealing with. I'm pretty busy and don;t have time to just bring my car over for the hell of it. Plus it's a very very common car so obviously this person doesn't do to many of these jobs. So I tell him I cant come over and he says to just bring it in on the day of my appointment but he tells me to bring it in at 1 which is to late for me. So I email the owner or whoever and tell him I have to cancel the appointment because it's to late and he says ok. So they really didn't want my business which is sad because when I find a shop I like I spend a good amount of money there but oh well there loss.
