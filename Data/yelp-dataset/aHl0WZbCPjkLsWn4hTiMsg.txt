4	They came through on the phone quote. They were all pleasant to talk to and work with us when we left some items in the car.
1	The Hertz in Chandler was very pleasant when we first got our rental car.. when I tried to get a hold of them to ask questions about when and where to drop off the car I called 20 times got disconnected after hearing them laughing and joking in the background I got placed on a 20 minute hold with out anyone checking back with me. I also talked to Cassie would told me that her computers were down and would give me a call back as soon ad they were back up which never happened. When I finally got a hold of them again I spoke with Tyler who was very rude and wouldn't let me tell him why I was calling. He cut me off and told me I didn't know what I was talking about. I will NEVER rent from them again!!! I wouldn't even give them 1 star...
5	I've yet to encounter any issues with this Hertz location as I'm a repeat customer. The staff is usually courteous & helpful. No problems with pick up & drop off as well. The car selections they provide me are usually good. Cassie has been my point of contact whenever i rent from this location. Keep up the good work Hertz! Thx
1	Terrible service. Reserved a car online to pick up at 11. Arrived at 1130 and the car wasn't ready. They charged an extra 200$ deposit on top of the rental fee which they didn't tell me about until after they swiped my credit card. Car was finally ready nearly 30 minutes later and it is horrible to drive. I can't tell if it's poorly maintained or just an awful car. Also the employees just act like they don't care and provide poor service.Will never rent from here again and wouldn't recommend anyone else go here either.
