5	I had a great experience with an Angie's List Big Deal service provider. Outdoor Lighting Perspectives came and balanced and tuned up all my front and back yard landscape lighting. Joseph Wilaby replaced all the bulbs and was professional and a pleasure to work with. He is getting me an estimate on some improvements. Best 30 dollar coupon ever! Highly recommended! http://phoenix.outdoorlights.com/Great job and I look forward to having the work done that you suggested.On time, reasonable price, professional and personable. What more could you want?
5	We used them for design and installation on extensive grounds, citrus trees, pool, walkways, lighting outdoor art work, etc.  Rich had great ideas and suggestions, and the crews were always prompt and efficient. One follow-up issue with condensation in a couple of lights was repaired quickly.  Their products are top of the line, and we have received many compliments on their work. Highly recommended.
5	Moving to a new home is seldom easy, but on our recent move, we did something smart. We saw an ad  in a local home magazine for a company called Outdoor Lighting Perspectives and we called them. Several days later, owner Rich Perry came out at twilight with an assortment of battery-operated portable lights. He placed the lights around the house: front, back, sides. As it got darker, he made a few adjustments and incorporated the lights we already had.It was amazing! Our yard was transformed! The lighting was subtle: lights shining up into trees and down onto bushes, flower beds and walkways. We were treated to a nighttime light show...and could make suggestions and changes before any installation work was begun. Nothing was left to chance and through it all, Rich was knowledgeable and professional  and helpful. Now we sit out every night and enjoy what Rich and his crews at Outdoor Lighting Perspectives did for us. And for our yard!
