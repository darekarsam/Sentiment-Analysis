3	Maybe I just don't get the appeal of spending a car payments worth on a pair of jeans. Maybe I'm not a huge fan of boat rigging as stitching on a pair of pants. Maybe I don't like equating clothes that cover my ass to a religion.Maybe I'm just broke.Maybe.
1	Bad customer service. Douchy tall guy acted like he was the store bouncer and made certain that I knew that the store closed at 9pm "SHARP". This isn't a dance club, it's a place to buy jeans. I get better service online.
4	Every pair of black jeans that I've ever purchased have shrunk and faded into a dusty gray, except for my True Religion jeans. True! (lol) Years later and they've retained their shape and color.  Yes, they are expensive, but the quality is great, and I love the way they fit.I went Christmas shopping and the guy (hot, with a British accent!) was very helpful with picking sizes and styles.  I forgot to ask for a gift receipt so I called and was advised that I could just bring back the original receipt and they'd print a gift receipt for me.  No need to lug any bags back into the store (as other stores have required).  Very easy and convenient. And the lady that assisted me when I returned was also helpful and friendly.  Nice store and employees.
