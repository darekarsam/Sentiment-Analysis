5	Delicious tacos!! Small carniceria that makes food inside such as, tacos, tortas, quesadillas and burritos. They also have some bomb guacamole salsa and another delicious red salsa.  At night they bring everything outside and have a taco stan in front of the building in the parking lot. Probably some of the best tacos in Phoenix! A hidden gem for sure.
5	Bomb tacos hands down! Super legit and super cheap! The pastor is my favorite. It's a dive place but a must have if you like authentic street tacos. On the weekends they have a taco cart outside and can get pretty packed so make sure to go before it gets to hot outside.
5	This place catered a tailgate for the ND - ASU game last weekend, and I can say with 100% certainty that they are the best tacos I've had in my life. The meats are cut in a way that allows you to put just enough on the taco, and the juices don't bleed through. Oh yeah and the meats are salted perfectly. I had 9 tacos, and though I don't live in the area would consider stopping by just for a lunch! The employees are super friendly and really enjoyed the time - this was an unforgettable taco experience! I want some now...
