5	The most thorough eye exam I have ever received.  Dr. Hanian takes her time to make sure every dimension is covered in the Best diagnosis in eye care.
5	Great new digs, love it!, so easy to find. Got a great exam and contacts that are super comfy,also got new specs they are so cute, they are a leopard print. oh yeah:).  Dr. Hanian was very thorough. The ladies out front hook me up with everything else. Got my eye on a pair of  Maui jim sunglasses too.
5	Dr. Hanian has been our fantastic eye specialist since we moved to Scottsdale in 1996.  She is honest, has the most current equipment, a great personality, and a great staff!!  We highly recommend her to all ages!!
1	Took my boyfriend here for an appointment during our lunch hour. On the phone we told them we had limited time because it would be during lunch, and we were assured the appointment would take no more than 20 minutes. They double-booked and his appointment took more than an hour, with the optometrist running back and forth between exam rooms.  Most of our time was spent sitting and waiting, and consequently we had no time to even eat lunch.  Their selection of frames is very limited, with no name brands except a few Gucci hidden in a corner. And they have no contact lenses in stock, so you have to wait for them to be ordered.We will be taking our generous eye care plans to another provider in the future.
5	I LOVE Northsight Vision! My whole family has been coming here for 10 years now (WOW!) and love it! The girls who work at the front desk are so sweet and we know them very well. They are so helpful with check in, choosing glasses, adjusting glasses, paying, and doing the beginning of your eye exam!The new office is so beautiful, and so was the old office--always very clean, well lit, and inviting.Dr. Hanian is so nice and you can tell she knows what she's doing. I feel like she knows my eyes very well and I trust that she can take care of my vision!
