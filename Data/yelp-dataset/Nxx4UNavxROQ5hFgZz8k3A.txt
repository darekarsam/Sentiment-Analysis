4	Navarino is a landmark on Parc Avenue. Once upon a time an older generation of Greeks off the boat sat there and sipped coffee as they plotted their next moves. The place specialized in baked traditional Greek pastries and cakes, but branched out to lunch fare and salty snacks like little pizzas and cheesepies. Up until a year or so ago, the place was more or less unchanged from the 1970's - it had a weathered and worn look to it, but people from the Mile End wanted it to stay just like that. In any case, an overhaul was undertaken and now the place is gleaming and sleek, albeit still a bit dark and homey inside. The kitchen serves the same stuff, which is fine because where else are you going to get a decent sandwich with side salads and a drink for under 10 bucks, taxes in?For 9 months out of the year the terrace is open and there are 4-5 tables and about 15 chairs in various stages of movement across the space. It's a great, relaxed, and very neighborhoodish place to sip a coffee and lie in the sun with a newspaper. I love it. Highly recommended.

4	I just started working in the area, and came in for lunch. Nice little spot, fresh looking ingredients and friendly staff.I just got a tuna sandwich ($5.50), and a kombucha. They made the tuna sandwich on spot, very yummy, and the Kombucha was $4 (cheaper than usual $5 in places).I'd return.
