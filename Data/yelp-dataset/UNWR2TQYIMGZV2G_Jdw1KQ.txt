5	I went here with a Groupon and have been seeing Patricia for six months now.  She is a great lady and is as nice as they get.  I have had  several  microdermabrasion  and a peel.
5	I'm so glad that my first facial was from Patricia.  She is professional, kind, and very accommodating to her clients.  I left my first appointment feeling (and I personally feel looking) five years younger.  I am officially hooked.
5	Saw Patricia for first time this week. So impressed. Just the best combo of skill and personality. Beautiful, classy and well appointed suite. I had a microderm and enzyme mask. Skin still feels great. I've been looking for a new aesthetician since the woman i had been seeing up and moved out of state. Patricia was the third person I've seen and as they say, third time is the charm.
1	This is not a place I want to go visit again when I am looking to pamper myself . I was very unhappy with the way I was treated by Patricia .She is very unprofessional and I did not feel comfortable lying on the table with her working on my face. Once you have purchased the groupon coupon it's hard to get in touch with her to take an appointment. Will definitely keep looking for people who respect their customers and believe that each customer is special.
