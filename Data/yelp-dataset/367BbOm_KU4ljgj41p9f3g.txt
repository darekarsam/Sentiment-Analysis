3	Whenever I'm looking for something quick to eat and there's a Del Taco nearby, it's one of the first places I consider.  I was playing golf at the Wig Wam golf course and this location was right off the 101, so I stopped to grab breakfast before my round of golf.I ordered 2 Del Cheeseburgers ($4.58) via the drive thru.  It came out fast, fresh, and accurate....there's not much more I could ask for.  If I'm in the area again I know there's a Del Taco I can count on.Return Factor - 75%
4	The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars is the food always comes out hot and fresh. Service can be slow, but the crinkle fries are worth the wait. I like this place over taco Bell because sometimes u just want fries with that taco or burrito!
1	I swear I think they tried to poison me my drink was sour and tasted like something rotting the next morning I went to pour the soda down the drain and it reeked of something awful. I can't go back after that.
5	Great fast food place. In all honesty the only thing I like from here are the caramel cheesecake bites, I get my Americanized mexican food from Taco Bell but can only find these delicious snacks here. When I was in Iraq I ate cheesecake bites once every other week and I would count down the days to the next time they'd be available. I am so happy that I am back in the states and I can eat cheesecake bites until I'm sick of them. Friendly workers, fast service and reasonable prices.
3	Had never eaten at this particular Del Taco location before. Got my usual: the Del Combo Burrito with fries. The food tasted as it should, although if I'm being picky I would like the cheese inside the burrito to be melted... it was just kind of a clump of cold, shredded cheese. Some of the fries were a little on the crunchy side, but most were still soft inside and still good. You get a lot of fries in the medium! Some of the tables needed to be wiped. It was a pretty good lunch though.
