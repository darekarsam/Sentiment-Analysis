5	We LOVE this place :)The phos are delicious (especially with their brown sauce).The general tao is great.And it's cheap.Love it!
1	Why doesn't Yelp have negative ratings?This place is pure crap.Service is slow and inefficient, because they only have 1 chef and 1 waitress on a busy Saturday night.The food is alright, but the service is just unbearable. I waited for 45 minutes for a bowl of pho, and had to remind the waitress about it because apparently the cook forgot it... 45 minutes!!! FOR PHO!!?? Gosh...Then when she gave me the food, there was no apologies or anything. The worst of all, it was not even the pho I ordered. So I had her return the dish and ended up not paying for it. A Saturday night dinner with a friend ended up like this, just bad.I still left her 10% tips despite all this, but she somehow had the guts to tell me I should give 15%...How does this place even exist?
1	This restaurant put waaaay too much MSG in their pho to the point that I couldn't even move for several hours after finishing the pho. Service was bland, the restaurant seems like an old broken building.
5	Ordered delivery! The service to my place was very fast! They have an awesome delivery system on their website that makes it very easy so you don't have to call to order. They confirmed my order by phone after it was placed to double check everything. The food was delicious! Would definitely recommend this place!
