3	I love a good massage. My husband purchased a gift card for couples massage and gifted it to me for Christmas. Scheduling the massage was very easy. This location is very clean and the waiting room was very therapeutic. The massage room was ok. It was barely decorated and in kind of a weird layout. Our massage therapists were very friendly and professional. I can't say that I will be back after I use the rest of the money on my gift card, though. The massage was ok, but I've had much better ones. They really try to sell you on becoming a member when you are checking out, which I do not like.
5	First time at this location and it was one of the best massages I have EVER had. The girl definately knew what she was doing. Had the 1.5 hour deep tissue and she worked out every knot I had (hurts so good!). They were running a special for free 1/2 hour upgrade and I was a 'new customer' so the price was good, otherwise they are SUPER expensive unless you are a member.
1	Had a great first massage, so purchased the year long membership. Do not recommend this "deal." The massages are easy to book, but twice I have been given less than 24 hour notice that my massage was canceled. Rebooking usually pushes out time frame by a few weeks. Halfway through my membership, they misplaced my billing information and threatened to turn my account over to a collections agency. Hasn't been the kind of experience I would expect from a business that promotes relaxation. If you are look for a decent 1-time experience, this place is ok, but don't buy into anything else.
