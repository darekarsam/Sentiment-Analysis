3	This review is for the outdoor gas thing.This was one of the cheaper places I found gas, but its gone up! The store is easy to find right on the corner and it has 4 pumps... oh my! One side of the area to pump gas is a little narrow but it suffices. The one thing I hate to do is go inside! If I pay with my card I'm obvi doing it for a reason! To not go inside! Alas if you want a receipt you must go in, but ill pass!!Typical 7-11!
4	Hey, it's a convenience store... But after stopping here for gas and store items at least 100 times, I have grown to appreciate the staff here.
5	It's a 7/11 which is pretty generic convenience store but the staff here is fantastic.  I stop in quite often and they are courteous, plus if they have any specials going on (especially with anything that includes coffee) they let me know to get the best value.  I often get coffee for my office and if there is a specific type of coffee that is empty, the staff has always made me a fresh pot.Great service and the gas prices are generally lower then most places are in area.
