4	For $5 cheese and pepperoni pizzas and no wait, not to bad. Besides my kids love the crazy bread and you don't argue with a 5 and 2 year old when it's dinner time after a hard day of playing. Little Caesars is really great when you need dinner quick and don't want the grease in the box places. So far we haven't had anyone complain when you show up with a couple of pies and a 12 pack.
3	Chow time.
2	You get what you pay for then a little more here I just  hate that they advertise hot and ready pizza but I order and it's 6 min for them to make it how is that hot and ready
4	Friendly customer service. Hot and ready made pizzas togo. Affordable, convenient, to feed the family
1	I get the idea behind having pizzas ready to go and for $5 they are cheap but honestly just drop into local grocery store and get a frozen Red Barron for lower price and way more quality. Little Ceasars fresh and ready pizza tastes like the cardboard box it comes in. Sauce is bland, cheese is crap, crust is tough.  Avoid what my friends refer to as prison pizza.
1	Bleh!  Most bland tasting pizza I have ever had.  I get the whole $5 pizza frenzy....sure, it's cheap, but it's terrible.  I'd rather pay another $5 and get a way better tasting pizza at even Pizza Hut or Domino's.  At least they actually put seasonings into their sauce.
