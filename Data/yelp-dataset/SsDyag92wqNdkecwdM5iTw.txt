2	There's so much better apartments you can find around this area. It's literally right next door to a elementary school, so this place is crowded and lots of traffic at about 9am and 330pm. 1,2 & 3 bedrooms, pool, playground, community laundromat & they do allow pets. It is close to a lot of things as well smiths, food for less, 215, 15, china town, Mc.D and more.
1	Terrible place. Drug deals and fighting at all hours, noisy neighbors and police are there so much they need their own unit! The fire department is constantly being called because children play with the alarms. Management is horrible!! Try to make this a last resort and only if you are desperate!
