4	Busy place for a reason!  Linda knows her pavers! Took back everything I didnt use with no questions. Delivery driver took time to explain the pavers and what to watch for when installing.
5	Went there to pick up gravel for driveway with pick-up truck.  The process couldn't have been easier. You drive on the scale with your empty truck, drive over to the pile of material that you need, the guy comes right up with the loader and loads you up, back on the scale and pay and go.  Slick system!  Everyone there very friendly and knowledgable!
5	I needed 3 yards of decent quality top soil to build up an area in my backyard. I searched and called several different businesses for their prices.  Midwest Decorative Stone & Landscape had the best price for the shredded topsoil.  The receptionist was very nice and helpful with questions I had.  I was able to pay for the topsoil over the phone and it was delivered to my home the same day. They dumped it exactly where I had requested in my driveway. Very pleasant business, they will receive my business again in the future.
