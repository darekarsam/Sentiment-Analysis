5	Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! Great wines and always good company. The owners are usually the ones pouring their wines and most of their large family is involved in the business. I love to support local businesses and this is more than just a mom and pop shop!
5	Family-owned tasting room right here in Peoria.  They offer chardonnay to rose to cabernet and EVERYTHING in between.  You are pretty much guaranteed to find a wine that you will love.  And the best part is that they're all Arizona-made wines, so you know that you're supporting the local economy.  Winery 101 is a diamond in the rough that I hope more people catch on to!
5	Hey Westside Winos. You need to check this place out. These wines are bona fide delicious.  All of the Gallifant Cellars wines are fantastic but my favs are the Chenin Blanc and the Petite Sirah. Owners are fabulous people. Check it out.
5	We stopped here on a whim.   What an awesome find.  The wines were exceptional. Owners were gracious hosts.  $10 tasting fee for 5 wines of you're choice is a bargain.
