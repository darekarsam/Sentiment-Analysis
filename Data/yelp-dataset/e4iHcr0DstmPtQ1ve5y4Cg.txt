5	AMAAAZIING! I cannot express how good the food was. Took my mom out here last night, we only ordered lamb biryani, chicken tandoori, shrimp bhoona and lassis. Felt like I ate twice as what I ordered, They gave us 3 kinds of condiments to go with our meals, all of the chats were really delicous including the carrot chat which I have no clue as to how they made it but only that I dont care of what and how and ITS AWESOME. The yougurt one was sweet.. a bit rather different then regular Raita but perfect if you accidentally order your food spicy. I usually stick to mild and found the food just perfect to my taste. The tandoor came with a fresh garlic nan, salad i guess on the house? And with two plates of vegetable curry. My biryani was made excellent the lamb not stale and the food had some nice twist to it that definitey set it apart then other local indian restaurants. Last I was here had only ordered lassis and appetizers so this time when I skipped straight to meals found the experience very pleasent. As always I was served by the owner who was really sweet and polite and made sure to check in on us every now and then. The vibe of the restaurant is nice, hospitality rate 5 stars and the food great. Last I ticked of a star was because I felt it was overpriced but after trying them everything was justified. Verdict: Must must must try this place out if you dont love indian cuisine.....yet :)
