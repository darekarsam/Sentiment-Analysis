3	Its a bank. I keep my business account here and they give me standard service not really much to say. I have heard people talk about the poor treatment they have received at their banks. The only thing I could say is change banks. Whether I was in Chicago, Cleveland, Miami, Las Vegas, or New York it didn't matter Chase seems to have consistent customer service. Friendly polite...OK
4	Came to cash my check to pay an overdraft and the clerk said No you have to deposit it and the funds won't be available till tomorrow go to Bank of America they can cash it for you. wth?? So I left very upset, sat in my car for a minute then I went back and signed in to speak with a manager. Carmen Martinez the branch managerwas so understanding. Amazing CS she cashed my check. THANK YOU! Now I can pay my bills on time.
1	An hour wait to talk to a banker to do a simple wire transfer. Bank agent saw the long line while on her way out to lunch and we told her about the long wait and she said that there were other chase banks around the area. Horrible service and badly staffed. Manager should pay attention the the line and his/staffing.
