5	Tammy is the best!! I have been taking my two persians to her for the last nine years and my newest addition for the last four years. She is very accomodating  when I call for appointment times. My kitties are like my babies and I would trust only Tammy to groom them. They always look so pretty and smell so good after their grooming. If I could give Tammy 10 stars I would :-)
5	Took my pitbull here and they did a great job with her, for a great price! Will definitely be bringing my other pets here aswell.
