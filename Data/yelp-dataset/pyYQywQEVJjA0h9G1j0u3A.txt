5	A little more expensive then others in town but the customer service and the friendly service is worth it!  They got my car in and out in 15 minutes!  Now that is service!
1	Went here the day before Christmas simply for the convenience of being able to get in and out in a timely manner and ready for a road trip.  I also hoped that I could avoid the common "up-sell" tactics employed by all the other shops (you need this or that) given that this place being solely focused on oil changes - I was wrong.The Tech said that I needed to replace my air filter and transmission fluid.  I had just had the car's transmission inspected 3-days prior by a highly reputable shop and they said it was all good and didn't need anything even though I asked them several times about changing out the fluid.  I told the tech that I just had it inspected and I would pass on the additional services.  He seemed a little put off that I would not want him to do these additional items and gave a little "attitude" about it but they went on to change the oil and filter.Once done, they brought the car around and we went in to pay. .."that will be $51"  the tech explained..."for an oil change and filter?" I asked.  He said "yes, that car has a special filter on it"  he explained.  I went on to tell him how I can get it done at the dealer cheaper than that plus any one of the local shops will do it for between $19 and $24...even with the high tech filter!  He said "yeah, but you have to wait around all day for them to do it".So, I guess Shell Rapid Lube charges a $30 convenience fee for their service! I learned several things with this experience 1) don't wait until the day before your road trip to service your car - take the time to go to a real shop with people you know and trust (or DIY). 2) get the price up front - I would have NEVER paid that price had it been disclosed to me initially and 3) Shell Rapid Lube is a rip off!
