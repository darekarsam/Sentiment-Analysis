5	I use this service. When my refrigerator broke down. I was amazed at the low cost. he charge me less than half of what I was expecting to pay from previous experience. he told me he started working on his own because he got tired of working for other companies that rip people off when they are in need. when I went online and checked the cost of the parts he provided it was exactly the same cost with no markup. I've since called them when my air conditioner broke down, as well as checking out other air conditioners as I am a real estate investor.the guy is honest and cheap, what else can you ask for?
5	I've had other companies come to my house to fix my refrigerator. They kept telling me it was too old to be repair that I would have to buy a new refrigerator, I'm a single mother I barely have money to afford a new refrigerator. I called zenon company I had technician Billy, he looked at the refrigerator showed me the part that needed to be replaced he even showed me the site of how much the part was. Very affordable. I never felt so happy with company before. I'll keep calling them for all my home appliances
5	Had my fridge fixed when it wasn't cooling and freezing. Excellent communication and professional.  Highly recommended!
