5	Amazing customer service! I drive an '04 Toyota Corolla S. This is the second time I've used them within 6 months (apparently people like to rearend me.......... ha ) and they always do a great job! I trust them with any body work! My car came back looking like I had just bought it at the dealership! They were even able to squeeze a few more dollahzz out of the other persons' insurance company and were able to fix a few other damages my car had suffered over time! Things that were not even related to the accident! Love them! Love their staff! Love their work! Highly recommended!
5	I went to Collison Authority as it was one of the selected service providers for my insurance company and it had good reviews on Yelp.  I had to have my passenger door replaced as someone back up into it.I had a great experience.  John the service rep was really nice.  It was done in four days as promised and I am very happy with the results.  I did not consider price as it was paid by the person's policy (same insurance company as mine).
5	Went in for a simple estimate after having a few other estimates done around town. Other shops just didn't work out, either the customer service wasn't great, they weren't thorough, or they just didn't seem like they cared for our business, made a stop at collision authority. I am glad I did, service was great and then some. Monica Fox helped us and she was extremely thorough, informative and friendly. And this was just for a free estimate. Saw the work rolling out of the shop on the way out and was extremely impressed. Needless to say, I will be trusting my truck in their hands to bring it back to new.
