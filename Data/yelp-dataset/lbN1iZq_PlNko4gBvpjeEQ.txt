5	I shot Evan a message on Facebook. He reached out with his cell phone. We scheduled a service call for the next morning. He showed up right on time, acted polite and professional and got the job done at the price he quoted. Easy Peazey!
5	Evan came to my house the same day that I called and fixed my cracked Ipad2 screen in less than an hour. Would definitely use him again. Thanks!
5	I dropped my PHONE and broke the screen. They immediately got it fix within an hour for me at a much cheaper price than others. 130$ at in touch while other places i called would charged me 175 and even 230! Can you believe that?! Overall, their service is quick and efficient. Totally would recommend it to my. friends and family. And no, i was not paid in any form to write this review, I don't usually write reviews but i was so satisfy with their service that i felt like i have to put the words out there. 5 out of 5 stars for in touch. :) .
