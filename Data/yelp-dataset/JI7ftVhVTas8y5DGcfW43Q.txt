5	Just as the previous reviews go, very friendly staff and willing to work with our schedule. Dr. Weisner is my chiropractor and he has worked wonders on my back since my first visit. Tammy and Waleen are very nice ladies that go the extra mile for the patient. So lucky to have found this office. I always talk this office up to my friends
5	One of the best Chiropractors in Las Vegas,Not only the best chiro but the best boss.  Miss you Dr.Sincerely,Norma
5	Love Dr. Weisner and his staff. I have a little girl with CP. Would not trust ANYONE else with my baby! He treats my whole family! My 2 boys get adjusted from playing competitive soccer when needed. And the staff always tries to fit us in whenever its needed! We moved far from the office buy would never dream of going elsewhere!
5	I have been seeing Dr. Weisner for various ailments since May of 2000.  He has helped me recover from a serious car injury, and allowed me lead an active an healthy lifestyle.  Always very professional and willing to spend time with you.  Great staff as well!
5	Dr. Tino is great and very knowledgable. His understanding of functional fitness (Crossfit) helps him understand what is going on with your body. I have seen multiple chiropractors and none have been as good as Tino. Looking forward to getting back into the USA and making my next appointment!
