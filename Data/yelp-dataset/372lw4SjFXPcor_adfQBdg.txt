4	What can I say, I love bargains.  It's usually hit or miss with dollar stores but I am consistently pleased with the products, service and cleanliness and this Dollar Tree.  I'm almost always greeted when I walk in the door, the merchandise is neat and tidy (not strewn around like some dollar stores), and the inventory is great. 2 thumbs up in my book of cheap places to get your everyday items as well as decorations/seasonal items.
4	This Dollar Tree is fine and close to where we live.  It has a lot of stuff, but I think the one on Val Vista & Williams Field has more stuff.There is a higher turn over in employees here than in the one on Val Vista.  Sometimes when there are a lot of people, they should open up additional registers.  But, this location is clean inside the store, but sometimes outside, there is a bunch of garbage.  Maybe it's windy and garbage blows around.Customer service is so so.  Depending on whom you get, they can be nice or neutral.  No one is ever really bad in terms of service.
3	This store has a ton of stuff, cheap stuff for my class which is awesome but the reason I'm giving only 3 stars is because of the poor customer service. I get that this is probably a low paying job and granted when I was in the employees were younger people, but come on!! They ignored every customer while they talked about outside activities when I went to checkout they continued to ignore me and quite frankly I felt they were just rude, rude, rude.
