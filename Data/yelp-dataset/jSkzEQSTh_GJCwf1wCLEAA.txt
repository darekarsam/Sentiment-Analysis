4	They had the best price when I needed my furnace replaced mid-winter and they were quick to schedule and perform the installation. The office staff and service people have all been friendly and easy to work with, and assisted us in getting energy efficiency rebates. They recently serviced my A/C thoroughly when it pooped out in hot weather, and they did so on the same day I called it in. They've earned my recommendation and continued business.
4	We've used Warren several times now and most recently when our Furnace took a dive in the middle of the icy doldrums of February.  They're fast and efficient.  The service techs are always polite, pleasant and knowledgeable.  Most importantly, the prices are always very affordable.  Even an emergency service call on a Sunday didn't burn my pocketbook.  We'll definitely continue using them as our "go-to" heating and cooling company!
5	I chose Warren Heating based on a word of mouth recommendation. I found this business to be a modern day company with old fashioned integrity. The phone was answered promptly and professionally by a real person, service was scheduled quickly, and the technician confirmed the actual arrival time within the appointment window. I ended up needing to replace my 18 year old unit. The installation went smoothly, the several "glitches" encountered were handled without fuss, and the fixes were improvements to the existing set up. Bottom line: this company did everything they said they would do and more. They were knowledgeable, professional, reasonable and trustworthy. I wish more businesses were like Warren Heating and Air Conditioning.
5	They did an amazing job.  Very helpful and professional.
