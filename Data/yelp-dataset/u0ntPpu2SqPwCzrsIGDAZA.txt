3	Your average terrible herbs. This location has a car wash & lube. Id give the whole chain an extra star if theyd start carrying my brand of cigarettes, capris.
5	My new place to get my oil changed! They don't try to upsell you on things you don't need! You get great service, for a fair price. I would recommend this location for a quick and easy oil change.
1	Horrible place to ever get an oil change. I took my car to gm on the 26 of nov and they did recalls on my car and checked my fluids and let me know everything was fine. I then went to this location on the 7th of dec to get a oil change and two weeks later my check engine light came on. I found out there was oil in my coolant and I immediately had it towed to gm to get it checked. They said the oil issue wasn't from the engine and that it was put there. So I had to pay 500 dollars out of pocket to fix this issue because I need a car to drive to work and get my child. I had to wait till the following Monday to get ahold of terrible herbst corporate due to Christmas week. I got in touch with a Quinn winters who kept making escuses to call me days later and after a week of escuses finally calls me back and lies and says gm told him that the problem was the age of my car. I called gm and they tell me that they don't know what he is talking about. I call him back and he says that's what he was told and his tech has been there for 15 years and wouldn't make a mistake like that. I said what does that have to do with oil being put in my car. He says that's his final determination and terribles won't be responsible for anything. Your a horrible person you back your techs up when they screw up people's cars. Now I have to spend more money and time to take you to court to get my money back. Shame Terri or herbst shame on hiring people like him!! I am outraged and will get the justice I deserve for this.
