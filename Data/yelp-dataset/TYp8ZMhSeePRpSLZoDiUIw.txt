3	After a disastrous visit to One Stop Mailboxes and More, I came here to get my Printing & Shipping done.All I needed was to:1 - Print a few documents.2 - Package up some product.3 - Ship the package via my UPS account.It was a bit of a process, but after a few minutes of working with the employee I was able to get the services that I was looking for done.  She too had issues printing from my Flash Drive....when did it become such a huge problem to print from a Flash Drive?Overall, it was an ok experience.  I'm sure it will go 10x better the next time I need to get it done.Will I return?  Yes.
5	I have been a box customer with this location for almost 2 years.  Jess and the team there are great.  They totally help me take care of all my business and shipping needs day in and day out.
5	Outrageously friendly staff was patient, helpful, and didn't try to sell me crap I didn't need.  Very clean store also. Thanks :)
4	This store is cool I do business here often. The staff are nice respectful very professional. I'm always glad I stopped in here to take care of my personal business. Should you decide to stop in well you will be happy with your outcome as well.
