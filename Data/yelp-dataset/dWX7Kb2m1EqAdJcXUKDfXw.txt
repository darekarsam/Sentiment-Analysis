5	What a great idea! A vet that specialises in cat care only. If your a cat owner you'll understand how scary it is for your cat to have to be in the waiting room with lots of big angry dogs barking and smelling! But none of that here. Just a lovely quite reception and a very friendly receptionist. They were friendly, professional and knowledgeable. Exactly what you need from a vet. New cat Button got a great check up and her problem was quickly figured out and solved. The clinic is super clean and the vet made a point of cleaning the table down before examination. Its always risky finding a new vet but I'm glad we gave them a try. We will definitely continue to use this place in the future. They also stock a great range of specialist food, toys, treats and the likes, and you get a free toy mouse to take home with you, which is a lovley touch. Button certainly likes it!
5	This place was recommended by a good friend. I checked out the reviews on Yelp and was immediately sold. I love the fact that they only deal with cats.  The staff are lovely and very helpful.  They put Milo (my kitten) and I at ease straight away and were brilliant with him. We've been three times now, twice for his vaccinations & the last time for him to get 'chipped and 'chopped. Great service.  Highly recommend them. Wouldn't go anywhere else even if they are way over the other side of town.  It's worth the extra journey for the peace of mind you get from these guys.
