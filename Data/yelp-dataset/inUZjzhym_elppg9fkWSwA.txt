5	I loved this bar!!! The location of it is simply  awesome! It's a little small but that's fine. They have a bunch of TVs with all the major sports on. The workers were nice and attentive. Never really had to wait to order a drink; they were on it. It's a nice place to sit down, take a break and entire the people walking by or gambling on the slots. I will be coming here again!!
4	We had a great time at this place I am here with some people from city national Bank .The staff here was wonderful they had are drinks coming all night long .The bartender is the best .One of the coolest bars in Las Vegas I will be back
3	Just a side bar off a casio, better than average. Met some friends here. It is a little better than your average side bar. They have some decent craft beer and were nice about letting me see if I could earn my beer playing video poker while waiting for my friends and I did.
