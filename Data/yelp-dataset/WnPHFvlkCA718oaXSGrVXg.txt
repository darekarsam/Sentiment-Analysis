5	I've been coming here for years.  I like to treat myself to a delicious juice or smoothie while doing my grocery shopping.The staff has always been friendly and efficient.  The juices are all delicious.
4	Very quick and friendly service. I never grew up around the idea of juicing vegetables so I didn't think it could possibly be palpable. The idea of liquifying kale and carrots, to me, sounds awful. Try "The Doctor" and you'll change your mind!
4	Since I couldn't bring my juicer with me whilst on vacation, I had to find a place like this. Tried Le Docteur and Le Vege-total. Le Docteur is hands down my favorite. The smoothies were a little on the sweet side.-1 star as their juices have this weird foam on the top and of course, it's not organic!
