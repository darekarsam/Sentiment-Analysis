4	Steak sandwich - very different from the roast beef sandwich they offer, so please take notice. Thinly sliced beef, griddled and stuffed into the same nonna roll. The sandwich is topped with lettuce, tomato, marinated eggplant and pickled hot peppers. Like a naked lady walking around in the middle of downtown, not much is left to the imagination; this sandwich tastes exactly how it looks, you can already imagine how it tastes. The bread is crusty on the outside, warm and fluffy on the inside.The perfect amount of jus and fat from the steak mixed with the creaminess of the mayo and the tart and spiciness from the eggplant and peppers inspired me to present to you first, the birth of a new word in the English language... I give to you... "Sandwich-wood"... if you know what I'm saying. A word... or should I say "scale" by which all future sandwiches should be judged and defined. That being said, if I had the whole thing to myself, I'd probably have to excuse myself and step out for a cigarette afterwards; and I don't even smoke.
3	Good food and coffee, not so good service. I had a iced coffee with a sandwich and it was all very good. I guess the folks there were having a bad day because they were impatient and arguing amongst each other. Since I have only been there once I want to give them another chance. I will be giving them 3 stars now and see how it goes on my next visit.
