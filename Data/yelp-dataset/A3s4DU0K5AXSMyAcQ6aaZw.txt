5	This gem of a store is in a strip mall on S Kings Drive in the same parking lot as Mama Ricotta's.  They carry used CDs and DVDs and they will buy, sell and trade with you.  They have a small but growing Blu Ray section if you just recently purchased a player like me and are upgrading your favorite films.Even though there are always a few customers browsing along with you they always have tons of parking available in their lot.  They have two CD listening stations (a simple player w/ headphones) so you can preview potential music purchases.  What I like most is not having to pay full price for a great selection.  And shops like this always inspire the "hunt and peck" approach to discovering things you haven't seen or heard before.
3	The CD Warehouse is kind of like a used bookstore, it's hit or miss.  I have found some great CDs here on some occassions, and on others I felt like I was flipping through a fourteen year old girls CD collection.  However, they have no problem taking your used crap that you no longer listen to, no matter what it is.  You can also redeem your old CDs for store credit, which earns you a little more money.  The CDs run from about two to ten dollars.
4	great prices on used music and movies....wish they had a little bigger selection.I do love the staff here I have found them to either be big music fans or local musicians.Just the kind of people that should be running places like this.
