Birks should cover all your needs for bling from the simple silver chain to Elisabeth Taylor-style extravagance. This particular store is rather small so you may not find the most lavish pieces but they have the core collection along with watches and home decor. This particular store gets boni points for the excellent service: the staff is so courteous and helpful (unlike some other locations *cough*)! They can also be a bit chit-chatty which I love! After all, it softens the blow of spending a month's wage on a single, not vitally necessary item :)
1	Never would I step into a birks again because of the snobby salesman. They think their clients don't have enough money to buy a product they want to see first or something ? Horrible customer service.
