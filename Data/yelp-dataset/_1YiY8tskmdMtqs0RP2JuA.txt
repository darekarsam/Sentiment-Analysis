4	Great over all place. .. only lose 1  because they do greet you coming into the store but its very drone like they never really look at you
5	As usual QT keeps it's business sharp and clean...Also the staff was kind and courteous ..... Always a great experience
5	Simply the best convenience store there is. Stores are clean, crew is friendly, selection of snacks/drinks are extensive and boy are they convenient. Puts Circle K to shame and you'll never want to step foot in an AM/PM again.
