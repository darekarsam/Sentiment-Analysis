5	It is no exaggeration to say Wayne is the best computer repairman in the greater Pittsburgh area.  The service is fast and very affordable compared to other quotes I had gotten.  I trust Wayne with all of my computers and would whole heartedly recommend him to any one of my friends or family.  He is also made some great recommendations on off site backup of our data.
5	Wayne fixed my Asus tablet quickly and at a very reasonable price. I am glad I found a tech person I can trust with my computers and at a price the big box stores will never be able to match!, just all around great, personalized service!He is also a really nice guy willing to explain the techy stuff to people like me who are not tech savvy. And so nice to support a small business:)
5	Wow! Great service! I would recommend Wayne to anyone who has a computer problem. Super friendly and helpful - Wayne wanted to make sure to fix my problem. Willing to go above and beyond. Hopefully I won't have to come back, but if I had another problem with my laptop, I definitely would! Best computer repair in Mt. Lebanon!
5	Let's get to the punchline and I'll give you the story in a moment.  This guy is a genius,  he saved my computer,  worked a miracle,  and saved my holiday.I'm from out of town on a deadline.  I call Wayne at 7pm and say I need my computer fixed can you take a look?  I drive over to his  home/office and tell my sob story of having a 12 noon deadline tomorrow.  He tells me that he can't make any promises but he will try.  Over the course of the next two hours he completely reconfigures my mother board and saves me weeks (everyone said they'd have to ship it out to the manufacturer).  I can't believe he fixed the computer and he didn't even have his full ensemble of tools.  Also the price was more than reasonable given the situation.  I can't recommend him highly enough.  A miracle worker!
