5	I've been going to Camille for my color & cut since she was at another salon.  I would follow her anywhere!  My previous stylist didn't really listen and my red hair was always muddy looking and cut in almost a mullet.  Camille listened to me and gave me a look that I love.  Red hair is notoriously hard to keep but she finds a way to keep it vibrant and beautiful.  I recommend Camille to everyone and now she does my mom and niece too.
5	I have been going to Camille for over a year now  and I wouldn't even consider going to another stylist.   She does a fabulous job with my cut and color.  I even have strangers coming up to me to ask who does my hair!
5	I've jumped from hairstylist to hairstylist my entire life. Ever since I've found Camille, I've been going back to her again and again! She is a perfectionist who always knows what she's doing. On top of that, she is a very nice, outgoing, and sociable person. Camille will ensure that her clients are satisfied with their haircut, and every single time I go to her, she does a splendid job with my hair and cuts it exactly the way I want it. I highly recommend going to her for your hair!
