5	Laurie Hamilton is the owner/hairdresser of this amazing one-woman show. She has been cutting my hair for 10 years at least. During that time, I have lived in Phoenix, Tucson, and Yuma...and I have chosen to keep having Laurie cut my hair! I go every 6 weeks, and 9 out of 10 times I change my appointment day or time. She is flexible, good-humored, tender-hearted, confident and people constantly look at me after I leave her shop & say:  "Wow! Your hair looks great!" If there is something more to ask for in a hairstylist, I don't know what it is! Go to Laurie! Now!!!
5	Talented hair designer with great suggestions on color, cut and style. Great humor and energy. She cuts all kinds of hair. Highly recommended!
5	First timer!!!!! Absolutely love Laurie!!! After many boxes of hair dye, I finally gave in and went to a professional. I should've done it sooner. Laurie fixed my botched hair dye jobs and I've gotten nothing but compliments on how great my new hairdo looks and how healthy it is. Thank you so very much for doing such an awesome job and getting me in quickly and keeping me on budget. :)
