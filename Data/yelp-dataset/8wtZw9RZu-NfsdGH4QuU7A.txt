4	Great new SAQ. the selection is not the best in town, but who complains about a shiny new express?
4	Not the best selection, especially on the hard liquor side of things, but this new location is shiny, bright and all of the staff completely rock. The old location on Mont Royal was dingy and ghetto, but this place makes me happy and is right by a proper crosswalk so I don't almost get run over when I am in dire need of some vino.
4	I've only been to one other SAQ, but compared to the Toronto equivalent LCBO they do have fewer selection. However, they did carry whiskeys for the white elephant holiday party. Super friendly staff and customers.
3	It's a nice location and clean and the employees are always extremely helpful, but on Friday and Saturdays avoid going between 5-7pm, you'll have to wait in a line that winds around the entire shop. One thing that could make this saq better:  Get some Oregon reds on the shelf.
4	Where there is alcohol, there is a Happy Sabrina
