5	My wife and I have used Mesquite Tax the past two years for our tax return preparation and have had very positive experiences both times.  The quality of service and timeliness of the preparation process was far better than what we were getting from our previous tax preparers.  Thanks Tyler!
5	We have been going to Tyler Hamelwright for two years and found him to be helpful, professional and personable. We highly recommend him!
4	Tyler did a great job helping us with our taxes this year.  He was fast, efficient and cheaper than the "competition" which is helpful.  You will have repeat service from us!
5	Tyler did a great job on our taxes, we had a complicated issue on them and he knew exactly what needed to be done and he did it incredibly fast! He was also very accommodating on our appointment, we called the day before new years eve and he had us come in on New Years Eve! From this point forward we will use him for all our accounting and tax needs!!
