1	Scumbag who talks smack...big time. He's scum.With the ugly records to match his misguided look of purple/pink glasses, clothes from disco days, etc. So do your homework. Its public records. Hes been in trouble already in his short time of practicing. And it doesn't take rocket scientist to know you not only don't stalk som1,  but you don't do it when the victim is yur clients wife!. It  says a whole lot about his character...that & the fact that she's also a stripper. Where he stalked her at work. Get the picture?  CREEP!Now wait....this rocket scientist's (LOL) stalking  included TEXT MESSAGES! That's a bright lawyer.
1	LOSER ALERT! This guy is a drunken idiot who steals property & beats on women! Just because he's a lawyer doesn't mean he can break the law & get away with it. I wouldn't be surprised if his license is revoked in the near future.
1	Wish there were minus - negative stars, this guy is trash that assaults defenseless women when drunk POS that's what he is and anyone would be crazy to pay a guy like this to defend them in court when he is himself a criminal.
1	Is this the same Michael A. Urbano who, according to the State Bar of Arizona, underwent a six-month suspension for violating various Rules of Professional Conduct? Always make sure you do your due diligence before you hire a lawyer.
