4	I wish we had Aldo Outlets in the USA. Shopping here was so much fun! They were having a mega sale of 3 for $5 accessories. I ended up buying three really cool headbands. The store is filled with shoes for men and women, bags, and hats. The cool thing is that Chaussures Aldo also carries other brands such as Paul Frank and Volcom. The place is huge. It's definitely one of the must see stores on Mont-Royal (even if it is a chain :( ).
4	Wow, twice now that I have visited Montreal, I have accidentally stumbled upon this outlet and both times have been shocked to find 50% off everything or buy one get one free. So what does a girl do? Shop until my legging run, of course. I got a bunch of socks, leggings, fishnet stockings, cream winter cap, gloves, and was very tempted to get the shiny leathery looking leggings, but finally found some restraint. All of that came to about $20 CAD.
1	Ok I've been here a couple times. If you're looking for the ugly shoes that didn't sell in the regular ALDO store back in 2010, then here's your second chance at buying them now! They are ALL here. The ugly pointy light brown loafer, the gladiator sandal, that other sandal that had that horrible loop around your big toe, all of them are here at 75% off a price that was obviously way overblown.
