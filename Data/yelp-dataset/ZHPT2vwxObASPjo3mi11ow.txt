5	Wonderful spot in Parc-Ex! With a great atmosphere, food and people! They also do alot of good for the community.
1	Too left-wing for me. Cafe has no food and the store part is small and closes early, even if the place is open late. Total commies!
4	This is a great, huge cafe. Good coffee and nice food specials. I haven't been to any events yet, but it seems like they've got a lot of great community events and such going on.
3	Large space,communal tables, mismatched. SallyAnn salvaged crockery,hippie-dippie atmosphere,and skaterboy -looking waiter  and,yes, the store section does indeed close early.  We didn't order anything to eat,only coffee which was way too weak and not worth recommending at all.Atmosphere very laid back,almost sleepy,you can just relax and read, surf the net,tweet,FB,whatever,you won't be prompted to leave or order again,unless of course you want to.
3	I went here for a night of blues dancing a little while back and enjoyed myself. I didn't get a chance to really taste the food, but I can tell you about the their other wonders. I was surprised by the beer selection here. Deu de Ciel? Yes please! What I also liked was the spacious dance floor, which is lacking at other blues events. The big down side was the atmosphere, which is not as classy compared to other blues venues.
