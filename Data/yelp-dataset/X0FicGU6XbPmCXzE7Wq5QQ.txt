3	This is a very busy Tim Horton's. The cashiers are very friendly, though they don't speak very good English so you may have a bit difficulty ordering. We especially had trouble ordering a shot of Hazelnut in our coffee. After looking at the menu again, we tried to pronounce it in French, noisette, to which she eventually understood what we wanted. If you choose to stay, all food is served on ceramic plates, making it feel like a cafe. The pastries and coffee are all made fairly typical to the Tim Horton's standard. There is no place to put your garbage or plates so it can get a bit messy as some people leave their trays on the table or just put it along the cafeteria-style counter.
3	They renovated this Tim Hortons. It has a patio in the parking garage now. Aside from that, pretty much the same!
3	Glad they have a parking lot, though a drive-thru after their renovations would have been awesome.It's a bit better than the one in Parc Ex, but the clientele still feels sketchy, so I mostly take it to go.Same food that's overwhelmed you from coast to coast, I eat there as a last resort as there are not too many options at 4AM
