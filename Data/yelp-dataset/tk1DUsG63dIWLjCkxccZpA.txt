1	There should be a never ever, ever use button on here. This company is the biggest rip-off artist. My family has dealt with them three times and this is how it goes. "We've called your insurance and this is what they cover. You just need to pay this amount." You leave with your item and then get mailed an invoice for more money. You can't return their product because it is used and they rush to collections. My mother was given a walking boot and told to take it to try on shoes with it,. when she came back, the same day, they told her the insurance had denied the claim and she needed to pay the full amount. She tried to return the boot, then and there, and was told that since she had left the premises, it was not possible, even though they had told her it was 100% covered and she should take it to try the shoes and come back for adjustments. I paid the extra 300 I was invoiced for my newborn's leg brace and was charged twice to my card. These people better hope I don't see them outside the office, because I will hurt them
5	The main orthotic maker (Ms. E) is a consummate professional who really knows her trade and good customer service.  She repaired a 5 year old orthotic that another hanger facility said was irreparable.  And when the manufacturing facility in Florida botched the new prescription/order, she immediately straightened it out and made them expedite both the job and the shipping.
1	In a word, unprofessional. The people behind the receptionist desk were chomping on candy bars and acted like I was inconveniencing them with my presence. I was there for a pull on leg brace and waited for over thirty minutes. I asked if I should come back another time and was informed that she, the receptionist, was just getting ready to call my insurance for approval. What the heck was she doing for thirty minutes? I was the only one there in the office and the phone never rang. Once she called I was out in less than 10 minutes. Will never return.
