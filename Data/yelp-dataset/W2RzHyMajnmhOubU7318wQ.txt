2	It is open on sunday.  It has stuff in it.  The fruitcups were good.  I got a premade "Italian" sandwich.  Which I regreted buying almost as soon as I walked out the store.  I dobnt know what else to say about this place.
4	7 Eleven standard fare made a 4 star affair by being clean and having friendly staff.  Pittsburgh doesn't have many cheap lunch alternatives and for those looking for healthy this wouldn't be an option...but I do like stopping by when I've got little time and just need a snack-ish lunch.ps:  LOVE THE DOUBLE GULPS!!
3	Attached to the Doubletree hotel.  They have the items you would expect: popcorn, ice cream, frozen meals, sandwiches, coffee, bottled or fountain soda, milk, ice tea, energy drinks.  They also have a decent variety of packaged snacks.  Staff is very friendly.  Prices are average convenient store prices.  They don't take AXP cards.  You can get hot dogs but I wouldn't trust them.
3	6-11.   That's what this should be called because on weekdays those are the hours it's open.    This is a super convenient place if you're staying at the DoubleTree and they have a ton of food, snacks, drinks available to satisfy nearly every urge.It seemed like this one guy was working every time I went in and he was very cool, friendly and professional.  The place is pretty clean, although there is always cheese residue on the nachos machine, which just sort of looks gross.I can't bump this up to four stars because they do not have seltzer or club soda.  I need my fizzy water and it drives me nuts I can't get it at convenience stores outside of NYC.But overall, this place is good.  Thanks for letting me give you the 411 on this 7-11.
2	The items in this store are more expensive to those of other 7-11s.  This location is attached to the Doubletree hotel so maybe that would explain higher priced merchandise.  It does seem like tourist prices. Also they do not carry fresh bananas.
