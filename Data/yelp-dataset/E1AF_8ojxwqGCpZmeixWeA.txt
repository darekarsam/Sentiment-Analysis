1	Rude employee. I ordered sub and sat down to eat and was asked to leave cause they were closing right at 9:00 pm. You could have said something when I was paying and not be so rude about it. I will not be returning to this location where there is no customer service. Smh
1	I like Subway, but this location is always packed! Every time I come here there is always a wait. Don't bother going during lunch, because the line is out the door. I've literally had to turn around and leave because the line/wait was too long.
3	It's subway, food is...subway...if you can't get to a local mom and pop spot, thyey'll do.
