1	Used to be run by AllState Storage, and they ran the business very well.  New owners, changed the name to Black Canyon Bargain Storage...TERRIBLE!  Do not rent their units. They doubled the rates to all customers, they do not know how to run a business or what the term "customer service" means.  If I could give this business a negative star, I would.
5	Excellent customer service -- very friendly and warm! I called from out-of-state to reserve a storage unit for a friend in Phoenix and they helped me pick the right size unit and took care of all my questions.
5	Recently rented a large unit and found the manager (Lacey) to be EXTREMELY professional and helpful. She responded promptly to my emails, and was quite pleasant in person. The process of signing the lease was seamless and took all of 10 minutes.I feel safe visiting my unit, with cameras and lighting everywhere.I will keep renting here... it's convenient to me on Bell Rd and I17, and easy to get to from the highway.Very pleased with my experience and  highly recommend to others.
5	This place is so convenient right off of the the I-17. They had some great deals right now for paying the first month then getting several free and that made this the best price per square footage of anywhere around that I saw. What I loved the most was the customer service orientation of the management. I was taken care of, all my concerns were heard, and they have been great about returning calls or following up with any other items that I need. The manager, Lacey, is absolutely stellar and very friendly. I will definitely get more units here.
5	My friend and I rented a small unit for the summer with an amazing discount!!! The service was very good, Lacey was a tremendous help for us, making the sign up process quick and easy. The unit itself was clean and just what we needed to store our belongings.
