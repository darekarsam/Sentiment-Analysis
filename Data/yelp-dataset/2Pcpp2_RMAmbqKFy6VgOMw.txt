5	I've starting getting shellac manicures on a regular basis because of C&C. It's clean and the prices are great for nails that last 3+ weeks! It's a one-woman shop, so don't expect to get in in 24 hours. As a regular client I get priority treatment, which I appreciate. When I've had to change my appointments (which is a little too often!) I've had minimal trouble getting a reschedule. I love the range of fun, funk color choices and enjoy some quiet time in the :45 that I'm there. She also keeps up on cute trends, Keep up the good work C&C!
