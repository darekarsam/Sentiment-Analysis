5	I dont personally do alot of supplements, but the owner is pleasant, and the location is close to LVAC on Rainbow which is nice if you need to grab a quick something. I walked in to pick up a Blender Bottle to mix up my protein shakes, and he had them at a good price. If you want mainstream bodybuilding supplements, this guy has it, with isles of protein powder! Nutrition Rush is on Rainbow and lake mead, by Pin Kaow.
5	All of the Nutrition Rush stores are absolutely top notch....as a nutritionist and a former personal trainer, I can say that ALL of the locations have quality staff and products with excellent customer service. I've been in Las Vegas for 6 years and as a fitness industry professional and enthusiast, I can say that these stores versus any other nutrition store here are the BEST to go to when looking for anything related to health and fitness.....no hassle sales, best price matches, and QUALITY!
5	Good selection and friendly staff. I appreciate the fact that the employees are fit and have product knowledge. I recommend this store.
4	This store has a great selection. Joseph helped me and was very knowledgeable and friendly. Because of his professionalism I keep coming back.
2	I went to check it out after my workout at LVAC store was extremely hot and uncomfortable inside. Poor customer service did not  seem interested in helping me. Selection poor and price high . Definitely not worth checking out !!!
1	Back in Vegas again last weekend. Went to check out rush nutrition. The store was a very small with hardly any supplements. Little selection and prices were high. The employee working was trying real hard to push some house brand on me then lied and told me it was not their house brand. Very confrontational made me feel really uncomfortable, not a good experience. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.
