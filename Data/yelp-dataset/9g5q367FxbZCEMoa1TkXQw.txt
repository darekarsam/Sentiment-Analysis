1	my boss sent me here to grab some graphic tape [i had no idea what it was] for some of the white boards we got. she showed me what the item looked like and sent me to this location.the location is kind of in the ghetto, and its a fairly small location. i went in, and passed maybe 3 sales associates, and not a single one acknowledged the fact that i had walked in the store.i walked around and hoped i could find the item myself, and after a lap or two around the entire store, i couldnt find it. i asked one of the sales associates and she seemed really caught up in the re-stocking she was doing, but helped me find the section the item should be in. come to find, she has no idea what the item looks like.needless to say, i wont be going back to this location, unless i absolutely have to.
5	Awesome customer service.  As we walked in we were greeted by two separate employees.  When does that ever happen?! We found the colored Sharpie Markers we came for.  We inquired if they had gift bags.  We were told they did not but one employee remembered some on clearance but the other reminded him those were for Xmas and were long gone. Wouldn't have worked for our application anyway, but thanks for trying to save us some bucks!He instead directed us to the CVS in the same center.  Not being locals, that was nice for him to point out.Way to go OfficeMax!
5	I came here looking for some things for a project I was working on.I'm from out of town so Yelp lead me to the nearest office supply store.  They had what I needed, the employees were helpful and greeted me upon entering and it was a quick, seamless transaction.  If I'm ever in need of office supplies when I'm back in town I'll seriously consider this location & store again.
1	I would never giver a star on this location. Very unprofessional people works at the printing. They should be fired in my vocabulary. I'm front the east coast and I mean business. I was there 11/24/14 at 9:45 am. Calling store manager....
