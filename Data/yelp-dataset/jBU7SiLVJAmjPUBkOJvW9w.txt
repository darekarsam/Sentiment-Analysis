4	If you're in the mood for a greasy diner, this is the place.  We had a nice big plate of smoked meat and a big plate of poutine.  Both were delicious, but I was actually expecting slightly better poutine.  It's not the fanciest of places (i.e. you need to get a key to use the bathroom), but hey, it's a cheap choice and open late!
3	The breakfast is ok because their pancakes are not too good. Such big portions with very nice prices. But.. the servers are not all very friendly or attentive which kind of annoyed me.
3	Smoked meat is pretty good considering the reputation of the restaurant.
