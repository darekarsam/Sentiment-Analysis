4	Being fairly new (not counting a few ill-advised golf outings in high school) to golf, I don't have a lot to compare this course to as far as conditions versus other courses I have played, but I would still recommend to most (especially novice) golfers.As others have mentioned, it is fairly flat, and other than a couple bunkers and a couple water hazards, it is a fairly "easy" course.Prices are reasonable too; even with the new price hike ($35 for 18 with a cart during peak day hours) it is reasonable compared to a lot of the Valley's more prestigious courses.The staff is friendly, clubhouse facilities are clean, even though fairly dated, and they have a small selection of shirts, bags, balls, and shoes for purchase.
4	I hadn't heard great things about this golf course, but since the name3 change and I presume ownership change this have changed for the better. We played a foursome last Stayrday, and with the exception of the green on the second hole the course was in good shape. It's tight, but for the high handicappers no houses, so there aren't to many chances of lost balls. But you could easily be playing from another fairway.We are not great golfers but we enjoyed ourselves, pace if play was a little slow initially but improved as the round continued.I would definitely go back especially since the rates are also very reasonable.
2	You get what you pay for.  Played for 24 bucks on a November Saturday .. Sweet deal!  Play was slow .. I get that.  But there was no marshal anywhere on the course to try and speed up slow playing idiots.  We wound up skipping a hole to get around a mother and father who thought Saturday morning was a good time to give their elementary school aged sons a golf lesson.Just brutal.The course was in decent shape.  It's just no fun to play when the pro shop lets you drown out there.
