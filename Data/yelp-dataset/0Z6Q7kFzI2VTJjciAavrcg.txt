1	WARNING: Nationwide Vision WILL rip you off. They billed me for a medical condition, so that they could bill my medical insurance instead of vision and I ended up paying out of pocket. No other optmistrist i have visited has ever seen any sign of this condition. They made me sign paperwork right after dilating my eyes(I couldn't read), gave me contacts that made my eyes worse than before and now, a month later they are trying to bill my insurance AGAIN. I am never going back there. READ EVERYTHING they make you sign, they will scam you for everything you are worth. We plan to sue for malpractice.
5	I visit this Natiowide location often for both work and personal reasons. The staff is very helpful and courteous - every time. Great service and great results.
