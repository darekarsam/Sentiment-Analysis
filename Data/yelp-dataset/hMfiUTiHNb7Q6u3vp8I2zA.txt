3	A new bakery in Verdun! So new, it wasn't listed on Yelp yet, so I decided to stop there today to grab a coffee, and treat myself with a fresh pastry. It looks like they are baking many things on site, but they also have specialties from other venues in Montreal, like some bagel from Fairmont bagel. They also have a nice selection of dessert which seems all very good. Last but not least, they are making some Panini with your selection of meat, dressing, and cheese: it was very tasty on some fresh bread, and nice condiments.They don't have many tables, but enough to get 10 people at the same time. They offer free wifi, but the speed was terrible, even when I was the only customer. Despite the fact that they have wifi, I was only able to find one power outlet, so it's not the best place to go with your laptop. I would prefer to go there for reading a good book, as most of the customers seem to order for takeout, so it was really quiet, and the ambiance was mostly dictated by some classical music.A good venue in Verdun to get some fresh pastry like croissant, dessert, and bagels.

4	Excellent bakery! The owner was extremely friendly, I was visiting from New York she made me feel at home. I Had Bagel and cream cheese with a coffee. I took some French pastries. I will be coming back on my next trip to Montreal.
