2	prices are high, customer service is good. The guys dont know anything about vape. They are charging over 35 bux for a pro tank.. Nope. Their juices suck.
4	They stayed open an extra 15 minutes for me because I called before hand. Although they didn't have everything I was looking for in stock (an ash catcher couldn't be found in the whole store) They still took great care of me I will be back
