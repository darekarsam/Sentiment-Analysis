3	This store is good if you're looking for furniture - they have TONS of it. If I lived here I'd probably buy a few items (we're talking huge amazing sofas, tables, chairs, etc). Woman's clothing is ok - I didn't see anything that really stood out. Overall the store is clean and well organized.
4	LOVE this Salvation Army Family Store---it's ginormous! As Liza said, if you're looking for furniture-this is the place to be. They had sofas, entertainment centers and tables as far as the eye can see and alot of them aren't hideous as one may suspect. They have a sweet book selection too, which is set up to the side in the front of the store but can be a little creepy since the lighting is really bad in one part of it and god knows who is there or what's going on in the book nook. They usually have two colors of  tags of the day which will give you 50% off and I found a few Express and Izod sweaters and tops ranging from $1.50-$2.50 today ---can't wait to wash and wear! Nice employees but some of them don't wear the traditional red vest or apron they normally sport so you don't know who works there and why a man with dresses is walking right behind you when you're looking through stuff. I tried to donate stuff to this on as well and was a little confused by the process, they have a section outside on the side but it looks sketch to me so I just ended up donating to Goodwill instead. I've never been disappointed by the selection there but getting there can be a little rough if your northbound on 74.
4	They have great sales like half off on clothes - lots of furniture but sometimes overpriced but then they'll reduce it a ton sometimes. Good book selection too - housewares have seemed overpriced and I haven't bought much of those - clothes not as stylish as Lake Norman and Pineville areas.Nice people, good mission - I'd stop here a lot more if they were open later!!
