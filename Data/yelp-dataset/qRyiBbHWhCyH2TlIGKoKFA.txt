3	This office has several people in it including doctors and at least one physician's assistant.  My mother-in-law's coverage includes this office, and it's reasonably close to home, so this is where we come.  Thus far we've found the staff to be friendly and professional.  No complaints.  And they aren't in a hurry to leave the exam room, staying to answer all questions.  The tests they order are reasonable for the complaints of the patient, and they seem thorough in evaluating the results.Overall it seems to be a solid medical practice.  We will continue coming here for the foreseeable future.
4	This doctors office is very clean and close to my home. Doctor smith is amazing and great with people. Amy in the front office is so sweet and is totally their for you. I would have given this place 5 stars but the lady up front is not very friendly. She seemed to get very upset at the smallest things. She seemed to just be there to get a pay check. Just my 2 cents
5	I've been looking for a good family doctor for a few years and I finally found it in this office. Dr. Smith is great he really takes his time and you can tell he truly cares. They offer allot of services in office even minor surgical procedures and blood work. Staff is friendly and the wait time is minimal.
