5	George is fun to work with. I had several issues with my home and building project that seemed insurmountable. His knowledge and proffesionalism were a welcome relief. He was prompt efficient, knowledgable and a spectacular value. I appreciate the little extras that come with good solid service, and a sense of humor. I reccomend this business to anyone who wants real value, and a great finished project.
5	George came over today with another person (I forgot his name) and put up used cabinets. They were pretty worn out but both of them did a really great job on putting them up! They look amazing. George and his teammate were both very fast and efficient and did a good job on making everything fit together really nicely. The price he charged me was also under the estimate he originally quoted, which was a huge blessing. I would highly recommend this company and will definitely be using their services again!
5	Everyone needs to have a good Doctor, Lawyer, Mechanic, and Handyman at their disposal.  Look no further for the Handyman. I usually try to do repair work myself, but lately, I don't have the time, patience, or the skill-set.  We found George on Yelp and decided to give him a try.  He came on-site to look at the work and give a quote. He ended up staying and doing the work right then and there.  What would have taken me a full day (or more), took George 2 hours.  He's easy to talk to, listens to what needs to be done, offers his advise, and his prices are very reasonable.  After he finished, I inspected his work and it was perfect. I will definitely be using him again. Now I just need to find a good Doctor, Lawyer, and Mechanic.
5	We called George to help us build two media centers to accommodate our electronics and large televisions. George gave us a fair price and did excellent work. We are very happy with his company and his services. Thank you Yelp and thank you George.
