5	This is a Destination XL store now- which is still affiliated with Casual Male, but it's definitely more upscale and from the modest storefront you'd never guess how nice this store is once you enter through the glass doors. It's tough to find 2XLT sizes at your typical stores, even those with a Big & Tall section. Here, I find everything in my size and it's made by Michael Kors, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Nautica instead of Toughskins or Carrhart. They also carry shoes in extra large sizes so I can finally get the 14EEEs off the rack and that NEVER happens. Belts, sunglasses, ties, socks, boxers, tshirts, suit separates and workout clothing- you could get your entire wardrobe taken care of.It's not the cheapest price-wise, however it's worth it for the great customer service I got from Les and not having to hunt for my sizes amongst the mortal sized gear.
5	Good staff here. They actually started remembering me even after being gone for a while. They always go the extra mile to make sure what you are buying is what fits properly. They have a great selection. Yes, their clothing is a little more expensive but I can tell you after years of shopping there that they truly are a better quality and are worth every penny.
5	Amazing store!  Friendly and professional staff make you feel welcome.  This was my first time in to this store and I was truly impressed.  Thank you guys for the great experience.  I will be back.
