4	Not fancy, this venue is all about ice cream. Well situated on Wellington street in Verdun, Boboule is a nice place to go take a refreshment during the summer.There is not a lot of space to eat there, but you can always take your threat to go. The venue seems a bit old, but the service is always good, and the ice cream very yummy. The only negative thing for me is that take cash only.Not the only place to eat ice cream in Verdun, but one of the most friendly, and popular.

I always ordered a smoothie and they were quite generous with the fruits. Yum! Then came a new owner and now I'm never going back. I ordered a smoothie as usual. It had a unusual texture. It looked whipped, kinda like a milkshake. And I didn't taste any of the fruits; only milk. So I returned and I told the man that I don't taste anything and the texture was wrong. "What do you want me to do? I can add any slush flavor you want." That's just terrible customer service. If a customer is not satisfied by a smoothie because it was not well done, you give your customer another one. Last thing: It's still cash only.
