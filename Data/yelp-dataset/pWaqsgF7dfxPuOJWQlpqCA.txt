4	Great spot if you're into threading. There's an older lady there that I typically go to. She's the best.
5	I love this place! They have great customer service fast-paced threading your in and out in a jiffy!
5	After the last bad trip to the eye brow bar at the Mall, i was back out there looking for a good threading salon. Preetys came up so i drove halfway across town only to arrive half an hour past closing. But the proprietors were inside making repairs so they allowed me in. I was directed to a smiling older indian woman who promptly ushered me to the chair and got right to work. With a very gentle touch she cleaned up my very overgrown brows in a jiffy!  I was skeptical because she worked so tenderly but my brows were pefectly shaped and groomed. I will be a regular and refer friends!
5	I usually go to the one on 3rd and Indian school however i live close to this one i had no idea they had one here. The girl did such a good job only 8buckd idk how they get away with that talent ;)
3	This place is okay for an $8 threading. I had higher expectations, but when I walked in, the lady was on the phone and was unable to listen to what I wanted. My brows came out thinner than I wanted- I purposely grew them out to have a thicker brow, but when I was explaining what I wanted and when she was threading one of my brows, she was still on the phone. Also, the threading hurt. I don't think it ever hurts much, but I was in pain and even had a drop of blood on a corner of one of my brows. I will keep looking for a great place. I might go back here if I needed to- although they are thin, my brows look even.
4	Great pricing...beats the mall booths, hands down.Usually only 1 person working which is why I can't give it five stars right now.Spacious waiting area and the 2 girls who have worked on my brows were careful to not leave my brows too thin and listened to my instructions on shape.My new brow spot for sure.
