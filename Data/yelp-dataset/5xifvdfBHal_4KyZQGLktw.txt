5	Chipotle:) this place never disappoints me and I always leave happy. They always have fresh food and if I ever have a problem with the way they made my food they don't have a problem redoing it. I've been eating at this location since it first opened and I've never had one problem.
4	Good quick service. Even with a long line the employees speed you right through. It's chipotle so the food is always good. Only downfall is the portions, But other then that never had a bad experience at this location.
5	Love this place, good customer service, fast service and out of most Chipotoles I been to, this one gives the largest protion
1	I come at least once a week to mesa location was in the Phoenix area and decided on chipotle. The portions were a lot smaller was not told how much extra steak is or guacamole made my order wrong at the very end put to much sour cream on my husbands bowl and had to wait to pay because the cashier had her back turned to me and she did not offer me a drink or chips. I will not go to this location again even if I'm the area
5	Hands Down to my Night crew(Matt) & the whole Team. Always Pleasant and polite. A Very clean place. Love This location, my food always FRESH & HOT. 7427 West Thomas RoadPhoenix, AZ 85033
