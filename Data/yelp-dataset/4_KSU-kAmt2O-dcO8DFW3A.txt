4	Good store, but not found alot yet.  Great cleanliness, and I totally agree about the pleasant employees (and that starts at the top, so I assume the manager here is a peach!).  Bought a few things, but still seeking that big item for less on my hunt.
5	I love this location!First it's big and very clean!  The staff is nice and ready to help all the time!One thing I enjoy is the neighborhood. This place gets excellent donations because the neighborhoods surrounding it are upscale nice houses. The housewares section is a little lacking when it comes to vintage kitchen stuff. I never find jewelry boxes here but do find  other things like shelf's and what not. They have a huge selection of furniture here!  Most of it is priced very fair and it great shape!The thing I love the most here? CLOTHES! They have tons of awesome women's clothes.  I have seen Tommy Hilfiger, Express, Banana Republic, Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, and more.  They have great clothes and dresses. I never had much luck in men's clothes but it's hard to find clothes for my BF size. I have not spent much time in kids clothes or toys either so I can't speak on that. However I am going to get my son summer clothes here this week so I will update my post then. When at this GW I never got the feeling someone might stab me to steal my $5 cash because they have more normal customers!  I have spent time talking to some of them in line and some of them thrift just to donate to homeless and shelters. That is AMAZING!
3	What can I say, its the "WILL".
