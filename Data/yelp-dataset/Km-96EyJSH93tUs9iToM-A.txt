5	Staff is always helpful and the place is well stocked. You'd be surprised what they have there! Great selection of food, beauty items and medication. Great little place when you need to grab something quick.
4	First off, if you're reading a review for RITE AID, I give you some mad props. I give them because you're either genuinely looking for the best damn place to buy pepto bismol, sweet tea, and emergency underwear, or you just got your girl preggo and you need a test--FAST! It's Rite Aid. I suppose this place could be better if they served some hot chili.
1	I had the worst experience with David in the pharmacy. I had called to refill a prescription via the automated system (which I will never do again) and then had my husband go pick it up only to be told that it wasn't ready because they had to order it--so there was no way we could get it before we leave for a trip tomorrow. I called and unfortunately David answered the phone. I explained to him what happened and he kept rudely going on about how they had called me earlier. I explained to him that I hadn't received a call--no missed calls no voicemail and he just kept insisting that they had called. So when I said I don't like your stank attitude) he threatened to hang up on me. I'll file a complaint with his manager about the mistake and his rudeness and I'll pull my business, but the fact is he'll keep being rude and my child will still have to travel without his medication. Stay away!
