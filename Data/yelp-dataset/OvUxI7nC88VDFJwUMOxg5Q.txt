5	All the employees at East Valley Ophthalmology were very nice and understandable. They helped me to make the decision on whether to get eye surgery very easy. They clearly told me my options and provided plenty of useful information. Some of this was literally life changing for the better. Dr. Hill actually talked me out of having unnecessary surgery. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for quality eye care where they care about what happens to you.
1	The Bad:I will not returning there again.   I saw Dr Kao and he was not knowledgeable about my semi-rare eye condition.   I was only told it was congenital which is something I already knew seeing as I have lived with it since birth and as a matter of fact I had written that on the paperwork.    I was told there were no treatments that would make my condition better and even doing a simple search on Google disproves that.    Some of the equipment to determine a proper eye glass prescription was dirty with smudges.   It should also be noted that the receptionist was dressed in sweatpants and T-shirts.   I know the last statement is being nit picky but over the years I have come to expect a certain level of professionalization and care.  The Good: Office had a very nice fish tank.Wait time was under 20 minutes
1	I was referred to Dr. Kao with what was initially diagnosed as a cornea issue. After a YEAR of infrequent appointments, a long term therapy of useless OTC eye drops that resulted in absolutely no progress I stopped going.For a short time I had an eye infection and while that was timidly addressed, it took going to another eye specialist to get a treatment that really resolved the infection part of my problems.
