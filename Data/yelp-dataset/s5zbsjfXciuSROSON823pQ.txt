5	Great deli! Sandwiches are creative and delicious. My favorite is the Italian. They have a pepper dressing that is to die for. The people are great and the store is very clean!
1	I paid $7.75 for chicken fingers. That is a typical price in the valley for fingers and fries. However there were 4 chicken fingers and that was it. Felt totally ripped off. Look at picture that I took of my " Meal" .
