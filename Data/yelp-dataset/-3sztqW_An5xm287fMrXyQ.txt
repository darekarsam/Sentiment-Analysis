4	I love the food and the price is right. So, if you're hungry for some quick and delicious Mexican food you won't regret it. Also, you'll be dealing with very friendly staff. Great place, great people.
5	If you are looking for a nice, sit down restaurant - don't stop here.  If you are looking for some real honest to goodness Mexican food, this is your place.  Yep, it's a bit divey.  But, their red taco sauce is some of the best I have ever tasted (and while tasty, it's not too hot).  I had their Number 5 plate - enchilada and taco - wow!  Their enchilada sauce is also something worth trying.  This restaurant is best for driving through and taking back to your hotel to eat.
5	Great food . Not too many authentic Mexican food places in the area. Definitely have the machaca burrito and any breakfast burrito is awesome. Trying the 5 rolled taco supreme tonight. Aguas frescas are authentic and homemade. Great service too. The cook goes into detail on making every meal a good one.
3	Ok just stopped in for some greasy authentic Mexican food... I got what I wanted. From the outside it looks like and old sonic or a and w. Parking lot is set up a little weird but good use of space. Inside the dinning area is small 6 tables. Very colorful. Menu on the wall has many was to use meat and tortillas in the same dish. Tacos, burritos, chimichanga's and so on. Beans and rice are average. Chips are soaked in hot grease but taste old. They masked the old taste with tomatoes and onions. The green salsa is very mild but has a good flavor. Red salsa has a slight more heat still mild. (Gringo Style) the chicken is spiced with peppers. So so as far as chicken goes. I would have giving 4 stars if the chips were free for dine in. Over all just a regular Mexican restaurant just like any of the "berto's" throughout the valley.
