5	I've finally found a gym that I LOVE to go to.  The workouts are challenging but so fun to do.  The workouts are different everyday so you won't be bored.  The owner Jimmy is great and really cares about the people who go here.  It's a friendly environment and they even have a play area for the kids.People of all ages, shapes, and sizes come to workout here.  I'd recommend this gym to everyone!  Great people and great workouts =Win Win
5	This is an awesome crossfit box! The trainers are knowledgable and friendly. And the workouts are challenging. I have been to tons of boxes and this is by far my favorite!
5	By far my favorite place to come 6 days a week!!! I highly recommend anyone interested to stop in and see what Crossfit is all about!
5	Jimmy has done an amazing job with the new box! I have been doing crossfit for 3 months now and I am hooked because of Crossfit Unwavering!  Great sense of community while you are here. Challenging WODs daily but feels so good when you complete them! Set goals with Jimmy and he'll ensure you hit them! Check it out! You wont regret it!
