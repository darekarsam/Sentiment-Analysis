2	Great teachers but the lady in the front doesn't have a friendly attitude! They need better customer service if they expect people to stick around.
5	My daughters have always been very interested in dancing. After finding a Groupon for the Base, we decided to give it a shot. I cannot say enough good things about the teachers and especially Julie at the front desk. She is overly accommodating and helpful (I have no idea what the previous reviewer is talking about... besides, you can't trust anyone who has a cat as his profile picture and gives Bachi Burger a poor review). We can't wait for the next recital!
5	By far the most family friendly environment I have seen in a dance studio.  The hard working lady at the front desk is absolutely amazing. If you are looking to take your kids to a great studio this is the place!!!!
5	Can't say enough good things about this dance center! The staff is awesome.  They are so friendly and accommodating.  Not only a great family atmosphere but the level of training is so much higher than other studios that we have taken our kids to.  True professionals!  I Absolutely recommend this place.
5	We absolutely LOVE The Base! We joined this dance studio when they first opened and couldn't be happier. Our 3 daughters can't wait to go to dance class each time they attend. The most professional and fun dance instructors and a wonderful lady at the front desk who helps everyone with whatever they need. This is a family business and the staff all work hard to pass along their vast knowledge to the next generation of dancers. Highly, highly recommend!!!!
