4	I don't believe it!  No reviews for Dream Lanes.  I get to do another first!  Well I used to bowl here a bunch and I can say that they have a good amount of lanes and we never had a problem with anything there.  There was always a good crowd there and a pretty nice clientele.   They did their best to stay out of our way and offered some great deals for the bowling groups through which I got a new ball and some nice new shoes.   Close to five starts but I don't review bowling alleys too much so I don't have a lot to compare them to.  They were good to me.
3	I really like this bowling alley. Despite what time I've gone, it's been active with bowlers of all ages. They are super family friendly and are very reasonable with prices. For 3 adults to bowl 1 game, I paid $21. Not a bad price at all. Order pizza and a refill gallon drink from Pizza Pit for $17 to get your belly full while you're bowling. Again, great price.I do think that there is room for improvement . The alley, facility,  is very outdated and you cant get any Internet connection in your cell phone when you're inside which I why I give them 3 stars. Aside from that, I love bowling here. Highly recommended!
4	$8 2-hour unlimited bowling specials (shoes included) on the weekends after 8:30. Pretty decent place but definitely shows its age. I have not tried the food but everyone else around were eating something. I saw a lot of pizzas which looked decent.My one complaint would be that it is hard to find bowling balls with the weight I want and holes large enough for adult hands.
