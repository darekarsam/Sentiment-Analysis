4	Great location to buy cleaning chemicals and supplies. I have been patronizing Clean Center Peoria for years and have no plans of changing. Arnold, Clint and Eldee are great people and very helpful. Just thought id mention tho that when they where not able to descale the heat exchanger on my truckmount they would not admit it. I had to take it to Interlink Supply in Mesa. However this did not change where  I do business. I have made mistakes in business also and am very happy with their service and products.
