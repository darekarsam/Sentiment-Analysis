3	I had the #3 Chinese dinner. It was alright but they did not put enough broccoli in the almond chicken. I also got a grilled chicken Ceasar salad and they did not put the dressing on the side which caused the salad to be all soggy by the time it was delivered. It didn't help that the drenched it in dressing...like way too much. All in all I would give this a 3.5. I also think that there is no difference in the Chinese combo's when u add a person aside from the fact that they add 3 more egg rolls to it (for double the price) I may be mistaken thoughFinal words the food was good but the small mistakes made it less enjoyable, could've been a 4.
2	Diner with the regular pizza and subs. They also have a Chinese menu and I mean old school Canadian Chinese food. It's no better than OK.
5	Always a fast delivery within 15 minutes!  All the dishes are delicious!!! Try it yourself!!!
