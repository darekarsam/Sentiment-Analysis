2	Extremely overpriced buffet, with low food quality. The brunches are ok after a late night... waffle machines, on-demand omelets, cereal, and donuts/sweets. Everything is very heavy and unhealthy, though. Be prepared to gain the freshman 15 very quickly if you eat here a lot. They try to rotate dinner foods, but everything starts to taste the same after a while. They clearly reuse foods from one day to the next which is pretty sketch. The servers tend to be pretty nice, though, which is surprising considering the messiness of the student patrons. I think I may've eaten dinner here once after no longer being on the mandatory meal plan, and that's totally ok with me.
3	The food is nothing special here, and they not infrequently run out of stuff--cereal and orange juice especially.However, it's not *bad* by any means. It's an all-you-can-eat buffet, so you can get a lot of food.I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here for other meals, but their breakfasts are decent, and they're open early (I eat there at about 7:45), which is convenient for those 8:30/9:00 classes. (one note about breakfasts: it may be cheaper to use DineX than a block, depending on your meal plan.)
5	Healthy, diverse, cheap, friendly, fulfilling, nice staff, generous... no adjectives can be enough to describe this joint, better than anything on CMU's campus.
4	I'm talking about the dinner buffet here, never tried breakfast or lunch. The food is healthy, but the choice is limited. The location is great (on campus), generally a good place to have a big treat after exams or whenever you want to engorge. Also, each Wednesday it has special dishes. The price is fine (about $10). The suggestion is to provide more kinds of food.
