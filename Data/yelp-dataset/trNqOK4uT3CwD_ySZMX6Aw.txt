4	Hamburger Heaven sounds a lot less suave than it actually is.  For me, at least, the name strikes up images of post-club buger vans selling fat, gristle and sugary ketchup in a napkin.  Contrary to expectation, however, the food is actually excellent.  All their burgers are freshly made with good quality pork, beef or chicken, and they have a good quality range of fresh salad and sauces to accompany them.  I went for a beef burger in a bun with onions, lettuce and ketchup which tasted amazing.  It was all the better fr the quality of the bun which was nice and fluffy, not one of those crumbly things you get in Lidl.  To top this off, the service is friendly and the prices are reasonable, making it a great place to visit for lunch or dinner when you fancy an alternative to the mighty Big Mac.
