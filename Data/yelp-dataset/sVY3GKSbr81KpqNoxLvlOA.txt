3	The food here is French cuisine, nothing truly inspired but nicely done and well presented. The decor is interesting with salvaged tables and chairs that in some ways are in keeping with the food, but in other ways seem a little too hippyish. The owner however is an anxious type and her customer service leaves much to be desired. Several good wines are offered by the glass, which is nice, and prices are reasonable.
1	Bad Ambiance.  My wife and I visit Montreal several times each year to visit family, and one of the things we love the most about the city are the great restaurants and friendly people.  We heard good things about this restaurant so decided to go check it out.  Showed up and found the restaurant to be very conveniently located close to our house, and was totally empty except one couple dining in the front.  However, we were turned away from the restaurant as we had our two young girls with us, and the host told my five year old to "hurry and grow up".  Seriously?  They actually turned us away despite having a totally empty restaurant?  Wow, how rude.  We then somehow ended up at "Casa de Mateo" in Old Montreal and had one of the best mexican dinners in years.  We usually hate the cheasy Mariachi band, but these guys were ridiculously good and very friendly.  I would definately avoid L'ambiance.  Unless you like to be treated like dirt.
