3	This is a clean store with a good selection of convenience items.  However, gas is usually a little more expensive at BP stations & this one is no exception.
1	If your gas light has been on so long that walking and buying a gas can is the only other option, go here.CONSISTENLY THE HIGHEST, MOST UNREASONABLE GAS PRICES IN SOUTHEAST CHARLOTTE.  Haven't found the staff to be terribly endearing either; but, the store is clean.  There is almost never anyone there.  It's safe, as CMPD is regularly patrolling the area.
3	This BP, conveniently located off of Ballantyne Commons Pkwy in Ballantyne shopping center, was fine for a quick top to top off my tank.  The gas was $.10 more expensive than what I paid off of Tyvola earlier, but the pumps were fast and all appeared to be functioning.  There is a large-ish convenience store, car wash, air pump and vacuums.  If in a pinch, or in the area, this is a fine choice, but I would fill up elsewhere if you are looking for a bargain at the pump.
