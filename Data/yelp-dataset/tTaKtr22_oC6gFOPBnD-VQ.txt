5	Rick Orr is more than a florist, he's an artist.  He did weddings for a couple friends while we lived in Champaign, and they were perfection - they stood out as zen-like natural sculpture.  Excellent place to get an unusual hostess gift, or to comemorate your anniversary *hint*.
5	For years Rick Orr has created the most stunning arrangements in the C-U area.  Growing up in Champaign I have counted on them to create corsages and boutineers along with Birthday and Anniversary arrangements.  I was sad to learn that Rick Orr has recently retired and the number has been forwarded to blossom basket.  We shall see if they can live up to the legacy.
