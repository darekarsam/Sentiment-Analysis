5	Fast, honest, and well priced.  Definitely worth a call when you need plumbing help!Buddy came to our house, was clean and professional, quickly diagnosed and fixed our problem.  We also had him look at another problem we were having and his quote was much lower than other companies that looked at it.I totally recommend Buddy.
5	My family and I have been using Buddy's Plumbing for about 10 years. He's honest and trustworthy. His prices are great. You won't find a better plumber anywhere.
5	We went with Chris at Buddy's plumbing after reading reviews to fix a clogged kitchen sink (the sink was filling up with water: strange).  Our problem was urgent and he was able to change his schedule to fit us in immediately. He was very pleasant and easy to talk to.  He explained in detail what the problem was and what he was doing. I felt absolutely comfortable watching what he was doing (normally I don't like watching) but Chris answered all my questions along the way. I'm curious how this stuff works so that maybe the next time I could do it myself. He used a hose that I had lying around the garage and took $20 off the final bill (nice surprise).
