4	A good burger. You can taste the oldfashioned-ness.
2	I was there the other night, 20 minutes til close...they were out of mayo, ketchup, lettuce, tomato, iced tea and baked potatoes...what's left to order?  Just close early...
1	Horrible Horrible service. It was like we were bothering them. I don't understand. I work customer service everyday and I know how to treat customers,  not here. I will never go eat here again, and would never recommend this Wendy's to anyone. The management needs to seriously look at how people are being treated here. Then when the food finally came the order was all wrong,  I didn't even bother to let them know.
2	Lady with lip piercing didn't seen welcoming. She was annoyed it seemed that I was there. I had a frosty it was like most and I had a value fry which was also good! Food is good just work on the friendliness and welcoming attitude please.
5	Nice and clean, looks new inside.  Friendly staff!  I'll be be more often forMy lunch breaks!
1	No breakfast?..really? Well that gets -2 out of the 5 stars and -2 because of the 2 times I went and got my order wrong and one time at night time they took so long to ask for my order. it looked like they were closed but no they were just chilling inside side, I had to go to the window and tell them what's up? You guys rich you guys don't need to get my order anymore? Haha I only come for the biscuit and gravy which they don't sell so bye.
