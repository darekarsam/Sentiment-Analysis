3	Greg's BBQ used to be here. Greg retired and East 74, which was in Indian Trail, moved here. I had a burger and fries. Nothing fancy...and it wasn't. It tasted fine and service was average. I'd go back for a business lunch or breakfast, but not to impress anyone.
1	If you see this place, keep on driving.  Bozena told me, "Don't go in there," but I didn't listen.  If you eat here, the odds are your entire meal will be brown, and though it may contain 4 or 5 items, they will all oddly taste the same.  I had fish (soft brown), shrimp (light crunchy formaldehyde flavor brown), squash (brown slices), hush puppies (brown balls), and mac and cheese (surprisingly white, with cheese somehow in the middle of the "clump" but not the outside).  The fish fry is like a brick of wet mushy paper towels.  I enjoy Friday night fish fry, I grew up with it back home.  The batter was not attached to the fish and slid off the soggy (not flaky) meat.  Given, all the meals here are under $10, I expect a diner to turn out some quality product.  On a lighter note, the guy at the table next to me was wearing a "North Carolina Powerball" hat, logo and all.  He was a huge fan of gambeling, which I thought was hilarious.  At one point during his meal he loudly proclaimed to a woman I presume was his grandmother, "Dad gum, that sure is tender, isn't it?"  Good times at East 74 is what I say.  If you were with me, I would announce one of my grandfather's famous sayings, "Take a good look around, because you're never going to see this place again."
