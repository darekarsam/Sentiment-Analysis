3	Ah, the Cogo's of my 20s.  I was living at Velma Courts nearby, from the time I moved out on my own until I got married in 2004.  This Cogo's was an old reliable whenever I needed milk or a newspaper or candy (I need a supply of the sweet stuff on hand in case my BGs go low).  An evening walk in the summertime to simply get a diet pop was always pleasant too.I really haven't been this way on Beechwood Boulevard in awhile, so I don't know how the place is today.  It's still there and hopefully as friendly and as convenient as I remember it.
3	Finally stopped back here tonight on my way home to get some gas.  I think it's been years since I've been to this Cogo's/Citgo.  I remember coming here in my 20s when I lived in the neighborhood.  Still the same good ol' Cogo's!
3	It's a Cogo/Citgo combo.  Always busy, but a quick busy.  Product selection is the norm for a convenience store.
2	Just your average neighborhood convenience store/gas station. Has what you need if you're on the go. I actually found Indian brand pumpkin seeds for a quarter here! I loved those tiny seeds of salty goodness when I was younger. Two major cons: Gas is almost always cheaper at the Sunoco headed toward Homestead and the air pump is out of service more often than not.After midnight you have to be buzzed in.
