2	This is the worst parking garage. They do spray the stairwells with something that smells like bleach to clean things. However, we pay a decent amount for our monthly parking passes. And the spots are tight, with the lines faded and you can't even see most of them. Also, people park in "no parking" areas, and in the car rental spots and nothing is ever enforced even though there is signs that say they will be towed. There is giant cobwebs all over and the lights are constantly flickering or out.
1	i dont even want to give them a star. this is the WORSE company ever. they dont know what the hell they are doing. i wish there were other companies in the city but they have a monopoly on all the garages. The price for a lease is a bit rediculous considering my car windo was busted out when the garage was supposed to be gated and shut and no one seemed to know how in the world that could have happend. For the amount of money i pay to park you would think the garage would stay open i dont know til 6pm when im leaving work and then i cant get in because the gates are shut so now i have to go all the way around the building to get in and use the escalators. i hate this parking company....HATE. plus whoever handles the billing... what a joke seriously.
1	They are an awful company. They have a monopoly on the garages in Pittsburgh and don't give a **** about you. I lease in of their garages, its expensive considering I don't get a guaranteed spot, the "guards" are extremely rude, the manager is rude to a whole different level. It's a zoo and poorly managed.
