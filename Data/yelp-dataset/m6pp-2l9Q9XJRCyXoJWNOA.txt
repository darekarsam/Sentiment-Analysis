5	Thank You for nominating my company to be on Yelp. As the top rated company on Angie's List, in the Mold Testing, Mold Remediation and Restoration category, I look forward to dealing with everyone honestly, fairly and affordably.
5	We just moved into an older home that had some pretty extensive mold damage. We called Moldex to come out and remove the mold and repair damage.  They did an amazing job. They were completely professional and their drywall work was perfect. I can't even tell that there was ever a problem. Great Job!
5	My husband and I used Daryl/Moldex for our mold remediation and couldn't be happier that we did. Not only was he very fair with the pricing, but he was a wealth of knowledge on the subject of mold and best ways to remediate it. The testing offered by Moldex is less expensive than many of the other companies and all around he is great to work with. I highly recommend using them if mold is a concern at all, even if you just want your home tested for it.
5	Daryl visited a house I rent out where a termite contractor suspected a mold problem. He was able to make an initial visit almost immediately. He determined the issue had nothing to do with mold and was able to explain what was going on. He didn't charge me anything for the visit since it was on his way to another call anyway. Rather than take advantage of the situation he was completely straight with me. On top of it, no bill was above and beyond the call of duty. I have no doubt he treats all his customers fairly and wouldn't hesitate to call him in the future.
