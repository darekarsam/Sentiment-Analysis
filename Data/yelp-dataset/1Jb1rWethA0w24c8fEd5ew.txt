5	The owner is almost always at the store and is very attentive.  He will help fill your shipping needs and engage in some light chatter.
1	Looks like I am not the only one that had a poor experience at this UPS store. I went in to ship a package that I needed to return to Amazon. The owner barely glanced at my package, told me the box I had was "too big for the item," and that I would need to purchase one from him for $6.95. I'm not sure how the box could have been "too big," if it was the same box Amazon used to ship the item to me. I had even added my own bubble wrap, just to be sure the item was secure. The owner was very confrontational during the entire exchange. I would have given him the benefit of the doubt and said maybe he was just having a bad day, but judging by these other reviews, he is ALWAYS having a bad day. I left with my package and I won't be back.
