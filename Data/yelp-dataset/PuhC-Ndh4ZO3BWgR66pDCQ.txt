2	Salty miso soup.  Disappointing sushi.  Likely due to the possibility that it looks like not a single Japanese person works here.  The waitress had no idea what Futomaki is...sigh.  Montreal.... Not one good Japanese restaurant?
4	Mikado adds an interesting and creative touch to their sushi, with various toppings and sauces that compliment its taste. The atmosphere is intimate, quiet and comfortable... BUT it's expensive. I recommend the ebi gyoza, sashimi (salmon is my favourite), paradise roll, mikado roll, ndg roll, and titanic roll, along with a bottle of Hakutsuru sake served cold. The lychee and green tea ice creams are a great way to end the night too!
