5	My daughter has been going here for over 7 years. They always makes sure she is comfortable. They educate her on how to take care of her teeth. The staff are very friendly. They always take time with you and give personalized service. And it's great that she rewards the kids for good grades!

1	Was very disappointed with this practice. We have been going to them since my little girl was a year old now seven and a 4 year old son we never had any problems.  We missed an appointment for the first time in the 6 plus years we have been going and we received a letter 2 days later saying we missed an appointment and they no longer will be able to take care of my kids.  I always thought the the practice was professional, great with the kids and our kids where never a bothersome either; to do that to us really broke our hearts that they would do this over one overlooked appointment.  Very saddened by this!
