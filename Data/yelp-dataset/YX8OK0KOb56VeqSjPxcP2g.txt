4	I used to live in NY and I thought no pizza could beat NY pizza. I was right. But this place makes me miss NY pizza much less. It's one of the only places I will get pizza from in Pittsburgh. The buffalo chicken pizza is AMAZING!! The crust is perfect with the right combination of chewy and crunchy and they serve homemade ranch with the pizza. Best. Ranch. Ever. I would recommend to anyone who hadn't tried their pizza.
5	Excellent.  Best in the Millvale area so far. Always fresh ingredients and dough.  The wings are great, not soggy or microwaved. Try the square cut pizza,  it's awesome.
5	This location is quite close to work, and at times when morale is low or he feels like he's been kind of a jerk lately, the boss will get us a couple pizzas from Frank's Pizza and Chicken. I have had some regular old pepperoni pizzas from there in the past, and they were definitely better than average. But the famed buffalo chicken pizza.... Oh boy. The crust is flavorful and at the perfect level of chewiness, the chicken chunks are large and tender, the buffalo sauce is spicy and not too greasy, and the cheese blankets all in wonderfulness. Then you get sides of ranch, and it's homemade!  Thick and rich and you can taste all the lovely dill they've put in there. It's the best dipping sauce ever. It was so good that I felt indebted to the boss man for this wonderful gift and volunteered to stay late. Perhaps this will be positive reinforcement and he'll buy me pizza more often.
5	Excellent food, the wings are by far the best I've ever had.  Warning, very addictive!!! (:
