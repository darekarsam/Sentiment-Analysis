5	I am a small business and want to support local small business, so I was impressed to find The Sign Jungle on  Craigslist.com that looked so professional and also in Mesa.  I called them earlier in the week to come out and give me a price and design idea on our monument sign that was getting a face lift.  Jeremy came out right away, had helpful ideas and I was thrilled with the price he quoted!  How's this for speedy delivery, he had my order installed before I left work today!  Thanks so much to Jeremy, I will definitely be calling you for business cards and t-shirt in the next month.Thanks again for your awesome customer service!
5	We used the sign jungle for our business 2 times already, great service and product. We will keep using them!!! 5 stars
5	I have been a customer of The Sign Jungle for a very long time now. Jeremy the owner is great to work with. Having worked with other design people, Jeremy seems to really tune into exactly what I am trying to do with my artwork. He is very artistic, is probably why. I had him design a logo for my business one year.For my business, I have had him make for me everything... from small car decals to huge window stickers, giant banners, also a auto wrap for my truck. The wrap has been on my truck for 3 years, sits in the sun everyday, & still shows no signs of fading or peeling off. It goes through the carwash once per week as well. I would highly recommend The Sign Jungle.
