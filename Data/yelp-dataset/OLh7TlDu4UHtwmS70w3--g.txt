4	Very close to my house which is why I love this place. They seem to have very standard/average pricing.They have a wide variety of cigars, papers and pipes.All the employees are nice but most seem to be lacking the knowledge it takes to answer a true smokers questions.
2	Friendly staff for the most part decent priced cigarettes but if you're coming here for vaping hardware you've come to the wrong place they overprice everything by at least $10 to $15 and because of that they get a 2 star that's shady business. I get they are not a vape store but come on over pricing even more then other smoke / vape stars.....
