2	Had chicken salad. Was good but very pricey. Their pizza is about 20-30% more expensive than any comparable pizza in the area. And since the pizza is just mediocre it is definitely not a good value so I'll pass!
1	Yesterday I had the misfortune of getting a pizza from Bishops. It was my first time getting a pizza from there in a long time. Needless to say. I won't be getting one again. I got a pepperoni and sausage pizza. The pizza was bland , tasteless. Crust tasted like frozen pizza crust. The sauce was meh. Cheese was okay. Sausage was disgusting. Bishops used to use a delicious hot sausage. I don't know what this sausage was other then disgusting. I don't recommend getting a pizza from Bishops
5	Been ordering from them since the early 90's. Always hot and fresh.  Best white pizza I ever had. Hoagie's are great. Burgers with curly fries with cheese is always a favorite. Sometimes they don't answer the phone for what ever reason, but when they do its great.
3	Bishops used to be the best pizza place around but anymore, it is mediocre at best! It really just depends on when you get it. Some days it's better and other days it's not. The taste and quality isn't consistent. Just recently we ordered from bishops and the pizza did not have a lot of cheese and the crust wasn't warm or tasty. It just tasted bland. I know that this particular location has been for sale but still operating, so hopefully new management can turn this place around and make it as good as it always used to be!
