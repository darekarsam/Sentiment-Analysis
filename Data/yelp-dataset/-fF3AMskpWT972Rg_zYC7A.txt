5	I've had facials, brows and lash extensions done here. Other stylists always asks where I go. Very professional and Carla is a miracle worker. I went in with seasonal dry problems and had never had a facial before. Jamie worked wonders, and after just one facial, I didn't have any more dry skin problems!! I also brought my teenaged step daughter for a brow threading and she was floored. Even her mom asked where she went! Carla and Jamie are the absolute best! And you walk away with the look you want!
5	I have been coming to see Carla for almost 10 years. I would never want to go anywhere else. My brows' natural arch is kind of funny, but she manages to make the perfect every time. She doesn't lash tint as well. Very comfortable and friendly atmosphere. You also have the ease of using an online booking system.
