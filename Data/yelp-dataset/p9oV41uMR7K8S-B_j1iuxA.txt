2	I called in a lunch combo for takeout on a Thursday at 11:30. When I came to pickup, my order was ready but the young girl behind the counter seem to be having trouble multi-tasking ie: ringing me up, answering the phone, making change. You're bound to get that at a new place and with high school kids working so I thought "no big deal" until I got home and my combo was missing the eggroll. So check your bag before you leave, at least until they get the kinks worked out. The teriyaki chicken was just ok but I thought it strange that the chicken seemed to be cubes of mostly white breast meat instead of the dark meat most chinese places serve. I will probably wait a few months before I go back since they only recently opened for business.
5	Went for a late lunch early dinner.  Food was very tasty and portions were generous. I'm new to the area and this is already on my spot of places to return.  I've had food prepared at Japanese restaurants that cook before you not taste this good. Very pleased. Customer service was also excellent.  My kids loved it too!  Definitely limited seating as stated in another review but worth the visit.
5	We ordered takeout (Hibachi Beef, Teriyaki Chicken Bowl, and Beef Fried Rice).  I asked for the fried rice to be made without peas (I hate that!) and they happily accommodated.  We tried this place based on a recommendation, and I have to tell you it was excellent!! I was prepared to have over-cooked, dried out meat but it was tender and perfectly seasoned.  The veggies were cooked more than your typical hibachi table-side cooking, but I actually prefer that.  I will definitely be back!
5	This place has the BEST food! So glad it opened up 5 minutes from my house! I love the teriyaki chicken... Comes with rice, delicious veggies, and a huge egg roll! The people there are super nice and the food is cheap, delicious, with good portions. 5 stars!
