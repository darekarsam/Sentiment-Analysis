5	This place confirmed what I already knew: In order to find good Portuguese food you have to travel away from the big city.In the Vancouver (B.C.) region we had to go to Maple Ridge for Sagres and now while living in Montreal we seem to have to travel to Laval for this place.Super affordable, amazing octopus, lovely people and the promise of Carne Alentejana next time we visit.Not to mention a great wine selection and the most amazing dessert EVER: Heavenly Cream. No seriously, you have to try it.So in love with this little gem.
4	Small and quaint, as most Portuguese restaurants are. But this one actually delivers the experience as well. The staff was friendly, the food was spot on. Everything from the cod croquettes appetizers to the chicken was great, including grilled calamari and grilled cod with chickpeas. And all at a fair price. Too bad it's to far from home for takeout.
5	What a Taste !!! One of the best grilled chicken i ever had. Ordered the spicy Portuguese whole chicken. We enjoyed it till the last bite. Very well cooked, full of flavour .  I cannot comment a lot on the restaurant as i ordered to go. A small place with simple decor, i was well welcomed and order was fast and professional. I would definitely recommend it bases on the food and will definitely dine in next time. 5 star for the freshness, flavour and taste.
