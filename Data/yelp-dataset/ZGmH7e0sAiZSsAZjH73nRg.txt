4	In short: Clean, nice owner, quick, and reasonable prices. I may stop in within the near future for some new designs. I had a pretty good tattoo experience here.
5	Great personality. Always gives you an honest answer. Works with some amazing vibrant colors. My tattoos get complimented all the time. Cannot beat her views when it comes to custom tattos.
5	This is the BEST shop in town. Emily is amazing. I thought I would go to a little bit cheaper shop and ended up with a crappy tattoo. I crawled back to Emily and she very kindly promised to fix it. She fixed it so well that I ended up getting an amazing lower sleeve that looks like it was done on a TV show all off a tattoo that originally looked horrible. They are worth every penny! I will never go anywhere else.
