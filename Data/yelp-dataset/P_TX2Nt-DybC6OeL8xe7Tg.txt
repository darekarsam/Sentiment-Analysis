5	Friendly service every time and I love the drive-thru ATM.  It takes pictures of your cash and check deposits and adds the funds to your account quickly.  I've been banking with them for 8 years and they are great!
5	Great staff here...very efficient and helpful, not to mention their people care about you and your banking needs.  Love how the ATM has been upgraded to show a picture of your check or cash, depending on what you're depositing, and then it adds the fundage into your account. Pretty cool! I recommend anyone I know looking for a good bank to look into opening their account with Compass. I've been a loyal customer for the past 8-8 1/2 years and have been completely happy and satisfied. I would think of banking anywhere else!
5	Consistently helpful and fun. This is a killer bank in general, but this branch takes service to a whole new level. The company should model its service ideals around this location and Britney especially.
