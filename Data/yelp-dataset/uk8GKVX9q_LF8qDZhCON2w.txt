1	Five people waiting to get their haircut, one dude. He turns and tells everyone that the person he is working on is his last before lunch, the other barbers MAY return shortly. Dude thinks he's an airtraffic controller or something, that he is required to take breaks? Also, where are the other four barbers? These lazy asses would rather sit and talk, as opposed to cut hair. This buisness has been here for a while, but they are on their way out. New age? Lol.
1	heard they are having a tenth anniversary? so they've given about 15 haircuts, now?
1	Not a huge fan at all.  The hours are actually inconsistent, and they do not have a business line which makes things very frustrating.  They also are understaffed most of the time.  Not a good experience.
5	I came across this place one day when I was looking for a barbershop closer to my home. The location very convenient its near ASU and the light rail. I can also drive there in less than 5 minutes. The wait was not very long at all and they had several tv's playing several sports channels which is great. The overall vibe was really chill and the 3 employees there were friendly. I got a haircut from the gentleman named JJ. He did and amazing job on my cut, it was probably the freshest hair cut I have ever received, no joke. JJ took his time to to ensure his work perfect or close too. I wish i could have found this place sooner. JJ was also able to hold a good conversation unlike most babrbers who kind of just make akward attempts. Overall i liked this shop and very much appreciated the professionalism the employees of this establisment exuded.
