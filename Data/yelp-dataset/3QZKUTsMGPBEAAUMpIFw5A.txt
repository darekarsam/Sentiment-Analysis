4	Restaurant is clean, recently remodeled and the staff is surprisingly friendly for a fast food joint.  I guess it's that Mint Hill charm.  Predictably awesome buttermilk biscuits and good coffee and the line moves fast even on Saturday and Sunday mornings.
3	At least judging by the building itself, this does not appear to be the newest in the Bojangles' chain, but it is actually quite nice.  When you go into some of them, it feels like you have entered another world - like crossing over into the dingy underside of the Cool World, with no hip Detective Harris to pop out and save you.As Seth mentioned, it may be the fact that it is in Mint Hill.  It might be that there is less traffic than many locations, such as the ones on Albemarle or Independence.  I really wish I knew.  But whatever the case, it is a decent location and you generally do not need to feel like taking bathing in antibacterial lotion after you leave, and you can just enjoy the spicy chicken goodness.
4	This is a well-kept and clean Bojangles.  It's always my go to on the weekends versus the other Bojs locations that I could go to.The lines move fast [if there is ever a line] and the food comes out nice and hot.  Usually just grab biscuits here... haven't been here for lunch so I don't know if their quality drops [but I don't think it does].  You can tell the Bojangles ship is run tight here with the employees being very friendly and everything always in the right place.
3	I was here in the morning time. Must say.. EVvvvvvvery time I come here, I feel like I should bring my AARP card, cards to play Bridge, Tea and maybe some crumpets. lolIT is the place where our elderly citizens come sit and chat a spat. (hey.. it ain't nothing wrong with that.. right!!)Coffee steaming HotFront extreamly clean
1	Close this store because they never have chicken! You order three wings they have 2 ready, you order beast dinner they have nothing but thighs. I guess they do have chicken but never what I order.
