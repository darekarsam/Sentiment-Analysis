5	Large store.  Great selection.  Not too busy, so it's easy to find a representative if you have questions.
1	This company is the worst. They send coupons all the time. We try them online and they work for the products selected. We go to the store (to keep the damn thing open and people in their jobs, online is feeding the unemployment in the country) and the cashiers always make an excuse why the coupons will not work. It is ridiculous. If it works online, it works in the store just the same, you're just being lazy.
4	The gals were super nice and did a check for some products, they didn't have it in stock but it was nice that they went out of their way to check. I'm sad that they carry very limited Benefit stuff. The store shelves are FULL of everything I want. Since I'm so close to this store I will definitely be back
