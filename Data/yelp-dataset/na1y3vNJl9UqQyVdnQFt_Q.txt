5	I like Costco!
4	Why am I reviewing Costco? Because you, dear Yelper, are a perfectionist like me.Where should one go for 20 chicken breasts in a bag for $20?Where should one go for 4 bags of bacon for $7? Costco.There are deals people. Just make sure to have enough space in your fridge wto stuff this stuff for the next few weeks/months.This is the place where I go to buy 1-2 select things I really need but always end up leaving with $200-$300 worth of extra junk.I now have enough razors, body gel and deodorant to last me until 2015.Ladies! How you doin'?This place is huge, it will happen. You will buy extra stuff you'll never need.It gets pretty chaotic and people are generally poor carriage drivers, especially since the ones you use here are Americanized. (huuuge!)I make it a point to visit this place 4-5 months before a holiday, because if you're here in August, they'll be selling things for Christmas.
5	I LOVE COSTCO! they always have such great things at pretty good prices. You need to make sure you know your prices before you go (it's not always a bargain). But besides that, I love it!
