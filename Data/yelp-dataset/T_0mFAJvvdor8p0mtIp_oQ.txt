4	Nice store and friendly staff.
5	This is the best game shop I have ever been to.  The owners are great, the "games library" they have is an awesome feature, and there is always something going on so you should never be bored.  If you like games at all, in any way, then this is the place for you.
4	Nice, well lit, clean and friendly. They have tables you can reserve to play games (about 6 by my count). Close to downtown Matthews with places to eat. Plenty of parking in the back. Could be a little better stocked, but over all big thumbs up. Nice in store game library as well!
5	I was visiting on a business trip and decided to check this place out. Boy was I happy that I did. The atmosphere of the place was just wonderful. The staff, especially Tim, was helpful and even help explain several new games I have never played before. The selection was decent and there was plenty of space to play your choice of miniature games such as Warhammer or Warmachine. I definitely recommend the Magic Draft night if its your first time here as its a great way to meet new people.This is a place I would love to make as my neighbor gaming shop, and would definitely stop by again should I be in the area again.
