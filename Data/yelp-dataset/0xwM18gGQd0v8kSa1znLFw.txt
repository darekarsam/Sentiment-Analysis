4	O Soeurs Volantes, the restaurant's first food truck opened their doors today! Had the pleasure to try their famous magical meatballs, garnished with salad, quinoa seeds, and grilled vegetables - all for less than $10 taxes included! Will certainly catch them again and try another item on their lunch or dinner menus offering a wide assortment of organic, vegetarian or even gluten-free selections.Be on the lookout for the food truck in one of the designated locations from now till September 29th!
3	Fun street foodThis type of food is way out of my comfort zone.First time having a salad wrapped in a tortilla with smoked trout. Along with a juice that I can't remember but was certainly exotic.Amazing pudding chomeur to finish off.Is it worth $14?Probably not, but it's fun eating out in square victoria during a free concert.
