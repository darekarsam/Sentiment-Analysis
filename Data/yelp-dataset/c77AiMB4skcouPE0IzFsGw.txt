4	If you're wandering around Easter Road and are in need of a quick bite to eat, then the Filling Place is as good as any other. The Filling place certainly can ruffle up a good sandwich, especially a ham and cheese salad baguette! And what made it even better was that the cheese was extra special, as it is sourced from the famous cheesemongers of Edinburgh, Iain Mellis. This little cafe however, doesn't just do sandwiches. They do baked potatoes, soups, Paninis and salads. All the produce looked fresh and the shop smelt full of fantastic flavours. I also believe you can purchase cheeses and hams from the cafe's deli counter. And the prices aren't too bad either, actually on the cheaper side of the coin. When I was in the cafe it wasn't that busy, and that in a way was quite nice, munching a small lunch time snack while people watching from the window seats. That will do me nicely.

Some say these are the best pies in Edinburgh, and I'd have to agree. They're a step above your average Scotch pie, and filled with delicious meat and gravy. The bridies are pretty damn good too. Mmmm! It costs more to have it hot and sit in (damn that pasty tax!), but I live so close that I just take it home and heat it up in my oven instead. Before devouring them in seconds and dribbling gravy all down my chin.I have had a hot roll from here before, it was alright. It's just a shame that it's not open on a Sunday, the day of the week when I most crave a roll and sausage. NOTHING is open on a Sunday on Easter Road that meets my roll requirements, sad face. Why won't someone think of my stomach?!
