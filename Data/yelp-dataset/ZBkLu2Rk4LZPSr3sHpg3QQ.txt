1	Poor customer service, inferior work and overpriced.
1	This dry cleaners charged me $7.75 to launder my husbands shirt.  A little excessive!!!
1	Terrible. My husband's shirt needed to be ironed after I took it straight out of the plastic bag from Carefree Cleaners. Absolutely unacceptable quality. Won't be going back! We moved to a house less than 1 mile from them and would've been a regular, repeat customer because of convenience of location. But their work was beyond unimpressive. I'll be going to Ultra Cleaners at Carefree Hwy and Scottsdale Rd.
