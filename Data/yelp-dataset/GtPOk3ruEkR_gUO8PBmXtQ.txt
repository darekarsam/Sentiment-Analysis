1	Would not recommend. The shop keeper gives cooked looks the entire time. Makes you feel unwelcome. Do not want!!!
5	The previously written review was not the experience I had at all.  I found the staff to be very friendly, helpful and I found exactly what I needed.  They were even able to switch the music out of the box with a song I needed instead.  There are signs asking not to personally handle the display merchandise, so If you respect that request I'm sure you won't have any issues.
1	Wow don't call asking for a manager. I called to speak with someone about a purchase and she told me she was busy and hung up on me. Didn't even ask if I was a customer or salesperson. I was definitely just a customer. This lady needs to quit/be fired/not work in customer service ever again.
