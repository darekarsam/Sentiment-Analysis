3	The Wife was planning to take a trip and didn't want to drive her car.  So, we went on Expedia to find the lowest price rental.  This place was the lowest price on Expedia for this trip. However, be warned that when you fill up before returning the car, you have to show the receipt and the station has to be within 5 miles...what's that all about?!  I've easily rented over 100 cars in my lifetime and I've never had to do that before....I guess that's what happens when you go with off-brand companies.  When I travel for business, I stick to Hertz and Enterprise...more expensive, but also more convenient.Anyway, we sucked it up and went on our way.  It's a minor inconvenience, but an inconvenience nevertheless.Return Factor - 20%
1	the rental you select isn't what you get...i rented a jeep wrangler or equivalent. what i got was a captiva.jeep wrangler                            captiva =========================================powerful 6 cylinder engine       4 cylinder pos engine  all wheel drive                          front wheel driveconvertible                               not convertibleso it isn't very comparable but what makes this criminal is thatadvantage doesn't even have a single jeep wrangler at the phoenix airport although; they advertise on orbits "jeep wrangler or equivalent".
5	If I could give them MORE than 5 stars, I would!!!  I was (admittedly) hesitant to rent from Advantage based on some of the reviews I read, but I could not pass up the great pricing Advantage offered!I went in "expecting" there to be a problem... I expected the employees to be rude, I expected they would not have the car I reserved and I expected them to try and talk me into everything additional they had to offer (at my expense)... NONE of that happened!  The employees were super friendly, I reserved a mid-size SUV and got a mid-size SUV!  The additional items (insurance, prepaid gas etc..) were "offered" but I was not pressured to purchase them once I declined!  The SUV was almost brand new (only had about 5000 miles on it)  It was a 2014 Jeep Cherokee sport, it drove awesome and had every feature I could imagine!  The only negative (which is NOT really a big deal (in the whole scheme of things) is the exterior was a little dirty which did not matter because the day after I rented it, it rained and there was a dust storm!  It's super hot In Arizona this time of year and I know they don't have each car professionally "detailed" every time it's returned... but I'm the type to look it over in its entirety and it was kinda hard to see past the water spots and surface scratches to mark any defects on the little sheet they give you (it was also almost 10pm)  I did not think the exterior cleanliness was a big deal! Come to find out, the gentleman that helped me at the counter, was actually the manager!  He was a really nice guy!  We ended up discussing Yelp and some of the reviews online, I was quite surprised that HE actually reads the reviews on yelp!  He was open and honest about the criticism that Advantage had received (some of it warranted, and some not... in my opinion) and showed an interest in wanting to correct the negative and make things better.  I assured him that I would be writing a review on Yelp once my rental period ended and without hesitation he said he was looking forward to it!  I had a GREAT experience and was VERY happy with Advantage and would definitely rent from them again!
