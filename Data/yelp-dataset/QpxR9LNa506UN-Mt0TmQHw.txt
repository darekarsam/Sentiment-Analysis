5	This is a great bar to watch football or any other sport for that matter, play darts, pool or just have a beer and hang out. The people there are friendly and it really does have a feel of a Phoenix "Cheers," where everybody knows your name. There are pool and steel-tip dart leagues throughout the week and on Sundays it becomes Bears country, the favorite football team of the owners. They have drink specials and giveaways anytime the Bears score or win so it's a double-bonus for any Bears fan to come watch the game here. Definitely the best Bears bar in Phoenix and the friendliest too.
5	Amazing Bears Bar with a true Chicago feel. Excellent bar selection and great service. The highlight is definitely the entertainment. Darts, pool, video games, and SO MANY TELEVISIONS! This is THE place to watch football.
4	Came here because we bought a Restaurant.com gift certificate. We had to ask the server for the certificate back because the two of us could not spend the $20 minimum required. Inexpensive food prices. We got burgers which were good. My complaint is paying $3 for a soda and $1.50 charge if I wanted to use my credit card. The place is nothing fancy; it's a sports bar. So if you are looking for a place to drink and shoot some pool this would be a great place for you.
