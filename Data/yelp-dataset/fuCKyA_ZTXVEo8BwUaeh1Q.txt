4	I just wanna know why  is it that everytime I go outside of the Bay Area I always get the option of pepper jack cheese?!?!?!Don't they know that's what makes the sandwich?!?!?But I thank and LOVE those that do!!Team Pepper Jack cheese! :)
3	Prices were higher than the ones here in SD and the sandwich wasn't that good.. I actually got a 6 inch and I only finished about 1/2 of it and had to throw the rest away. Soda refills were NOT FREE! wth??? kinda ridiculous...
3	I stopped in for a breakfast sandwich which is normally $3.25 at every other subway I have visited. Here it was $6. Absolutely insane. The sand which was fine-nothing special (is it ever at subway?)  and the staff were kinda rude when I asked why the price was so much more vs everywhere else.
1	When a customer ask for napkins it is possible they need more than the two you so kindly reminded me were in my bag. (Rude). It just so happens that YOU over filled my drink and it spilled. But I won't let your poor interactions with your customer navigate my day.  The one star rating will let my people know;)
2	This subway's already down hill. They have less options (no silantro or Swiss cheese). And  that is not all, they charge for refills, unlike other subway's or other sub places. And also their meat has a weird taste. But my sub was okay, but a bit dry.
2	Just like their jingle on TV "$10. $10 footlongs" Wait, no, that's not right. It's in the middle of a tourist trap mall. Not sure what else I expected.
