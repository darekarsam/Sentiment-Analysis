3	Came in to grab some boxes It was very dead & quiet just like how staples are generally when it is not back to school time...It was pretty clean and well stocked... In this business area, I think that they try to keep their store stocked well...Staples usually has good prices on everything but the boxes were pretty pricey... However I did need them and they were cheaper here than at Office Max...The general manager was helpful and very nice...Good store. Good service.
1	I came in to purchase a computer desk as well as a desk chair. Asside from being greeted by the cashier I recieved no assistance. A clerk who appeared to be the general manager sat down at one of the desks in the middle of the show room area where I was shopping for over 15 minutes and never greeted me nor asked me if I had a question. Many of the desk chairs did not have a price tag. Due to the lack of customer service I decided not to purchase from this store. This location did have a wide selection of office furniture.
1	Don't come here...  I was in the store for 15 minutes and no one attempted to assist me. I finally made my way to a checkout counter. No one with friendly or helpful at all. I will never visit this location again. Just realized that the 20oz coke I purchased is expired!!!   I'm out done now..
