4	Employees were actually helpful! The prices are high but the apparel and merchandise is pretty cool and of decent quality. I found prices similar to what you would pay at most big-box sports stores. The clearance section (where we got our hats and shirts) was 50% off, which made for a good deal. They sell Sun Devils stuff and also baseball stuff during Spring Training. So, if you forgot your Chicago stuff at home, rest assured you can pick some up before going to the games.
5	Whether you're looking for ASU or Cactus League gear, this is the place to go. Owned by an ASU alumni and located right on Mill, Cactus Sports has the best selection of clothing and other Sun Devil gear on the strip. Prices are basically MSRP, but they always have lots of items on sale.If you're a Sun Devil fan I definitely recommend Cactus Sports!
1	Received a hat as a gift that was purchased from this store. Sadly hat sizes are very hit & miss. Went in to exchange the size and was told that I can't even exchange it for a different size without a receipt. The guy I talked to was very rude and said, "how do we know you didn't buy it somewhere else?" Um how about the tag that says Cactus Sports?? The hat has all tags and is obviously brand new. Horrible customer service, don't spend money here.
