4	This place is a stand in the Pittsburgh Public Market.  While in town visiting we checked it out in the market.  We tried a spicy sour soup and a grilled cheese with tomatoes and basil on an artisan bread.  The soup was excellent fresh, tasty and flavorful.  The grilled cheese had just the perfect amount of cheese and paired perfectly.  $6 total, a real deal.
4	Delicious homemade style soups.  They don't cut corners, just delicious soups that will have you returning for more.  I had the clam chowder, which was a traditional New England chowder.  It comes with fresh slices of bread or a roll.  People rave about the black bean soup, so I will have to go back to try that next.  Part of the fun is talking to the Soup Nancys (neither one is named Nancy).  They are smart, articulate and funny.
5	These two amazing women serve up the best soup I've ever had at the recently relocated Pittsburgh Public Market.  They usually offer three soups - meaty/veggie/vegan - so there is something for everyone.  In addition to hot fresh soups, they offer delicious hot sandwiches and grilled cheese.  Don't forget to ask about the frozen soups to go that will satisfy all off hour soup cravings!
5	This place is awesome!  The soups are delicious and homemade.  They people working there make the experience and the paninis are bomb!  Love this place!  What a find!
