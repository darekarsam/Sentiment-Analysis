5	Fun! HIGHLY recommend them to anyone getting married in Vegas, regardless of your wedding style: wacky Elvis or Hangover theme or romantic in Ceasar's Palace Garden.  The Reverend is funny but still performed an intimate and special ceremony. Amazing photographer! Their customer service is also top notch and easy to work with them.Especially recommend for people who live out of state. They are pros and make it easy and fun! The Reverend did a great job entertaining our group of 12 while we took photos.  Had a wonderful experience and know you will too!
5	Awesome company to have officiate at your wedding.  It truly was a SIMPLE process.  Scheduled the entire wedding via text messaging & purchased the deal thru Yelp. Minister David was prompt, professional, friendly and quick.  They didn't even jack up the prices on the day of our wedding which was on 11-12-13, considered a "special occasion" day by some other service companies.  We highly recommend Simple Vegas Weddings!  Thanks.
