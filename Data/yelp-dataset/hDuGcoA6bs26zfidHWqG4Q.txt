4	Great Carne Asada burrito!
4	Love their carne asada tacos! We have never had anything but great quick service and good food from mi casita. One of the workers was telling me they will probably close down when their lease is up and I truly hope they don't.
4	Decent and cheap Mexican.  Not as good as Tacos N More, but not bad either.
1	Now called Peppe's, same owner Jose.... it was a good spot. they have lost their way. the owner is a nice guy, but, his kids ALWAYS mess up the orders and don't care. after many chances i'm out, food quality has dropped dramatically and i will not tolerate rude attitude from his wife. never going back, ever.. I'm OUT!
