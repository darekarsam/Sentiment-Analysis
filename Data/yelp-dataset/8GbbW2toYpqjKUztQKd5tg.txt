5	Orlando the Employee was above awesome, with his customer service. Anytime i have a issue he seems to be the one who always helps me. This is why i choose Walgreens plus one stop shopping when you dont need to make a Wally World run and deal with the crowds. THANKS ORLANDO AND WALGREENS.
5	Had huge problems with my insurance.Kenny in the pharmacy made a ton of phone calls and went above and beyond.I have severe back problems and without his help I would have been back to the hospital.
5	Great store! I love my neighborhood walgreens! Pharmacist is friendly and staff is helpful! Took 4 scripts today for my husband after a surgery. They filled them right away for me. I appreciate the helpful service and consideration.
5	This Walgreens is awesome all because of their customer service. Friendly associates. I was looking for a specific item. An associate was readily available offering assistance before I even asked and led me right to the item and even gave her opinions of it. I like this place.
