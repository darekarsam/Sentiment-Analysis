3	The Vitamin Shoppe in Matthews has been there for a while, but I never had an excuse to visit until recently.  The store is kept very clean and the staff was very nice and available to help you find what you need.One downside is that this location shares a common parking lot with the Panera Bread next door so the parking situation can get a bit frustrating at times.  Luckily there are 3-4 reserved "Vitamin Shoppe Parking Only" spaces, but that doesn't stop people from idling in them while their family members go place and order at Panera.This is a big place (for a Vitamin store), I didn't know they made vitamins out of some of the stuff they offer!  But then again, I can't really see myself taking 20 vitamins at one point in the day... I guess it will happen sometime when my hair starts turning gray.
