1	6 months ago, this was the best sportsbook on The Strip. Now the TVs are blocked off by a terribly placed bar, and anything resembling comfortable seating is blocked off as Members Only (regardless of the fact that seating was only at half occupancy at most). It's insulting placing hundreds of dollars in bets and being given a shitty conference room chair to sit in. If you want to see a good sportsbook gone terribly wrong, head to Caesars.
5	Nice place to stop, have a cocktail, and do some video gambling before & after a show or any time. *** Tip *** You can buy premium cigars from the casino's "cigarette girls"
