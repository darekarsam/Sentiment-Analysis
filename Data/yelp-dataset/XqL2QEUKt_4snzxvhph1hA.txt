5	Made an appointment last week for SparkleTime Window Cleaning and decided to try them out. Really nice, professional guys who did the job fast and really well. Showed up on time for the appointment, and the house looks fabulous.
5	I was very impressed with SparkleTime!  Scheduling was easy, pricing was better than the others and they did a fantastic job both inside and out.  I'll never use any other company again.  A++ experience!
