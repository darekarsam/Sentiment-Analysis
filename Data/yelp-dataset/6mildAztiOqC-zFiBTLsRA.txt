4	Swanky yet comfortable bar adjacent to the lobby of the Delano (formerly Mandalay's THE Hotel) on the south strip. Nice environ with knowledgeable bartenders serving craft beers and mixologist cocktails. It's tucked away, allowing patrons to mingle in the shadows while enjoying a nice drink or two. Not a destination in itself, but a good place to catch a drink or two while waiting for the real Vegas festivities to commence. Also note: Franklin. . .at the Delano. . .like the former President Roosevelt.
4	I just stopped in here for a few drinks as I was on my way out for the night The server brought these hilarious question and answer cards for us to start conversations with our group as we drank and hung out. A neat little place- the Delano used to be THE hotel at Mandalay bay and it's still a work in progress as I saw them hanging decorations in the hallway while I stayed here. A neat and cool looking place though!
5	I'm a local and this is easily the best bar I have been to! The laid back and sexy vibe will keep me coming back. Jeff and Cesar were so knowledgeable on every one of their specialty spirits. Not to mention they have a great Gin originating from the Rouge in Oregon, where I am from. They have a different punch cocktail everyday that I have learned to love. Myself and my friends will definitely be back!
1	As a 20 year local of Las Vegas this bar is just another example of the Wall Street controlled Las Vegas strip ripping off customers.  We decided to come here after a concert and after ordering a round of drinks discovered that a glass of champagne cost $29.  This bar has a nice atmosphere but unfortunately not nice enough to charge $29 for a drink. It will be my last trip to the Delano.  The mob figures who ran Las Vegas in the 1960s and 70s would be disgusted with the way the Las Vegas strip now treats customers by gouging them at every opportunity in its restaurants and bars.
