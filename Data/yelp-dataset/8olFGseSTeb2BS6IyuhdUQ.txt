5	Friendly Starbucks. Not long wait.
4	The wait was really long, except during nighttime, mainly because it is located in the middle of Place-des-Arts.The outdoor seatings are wonderful, especially during summer where all the music festivals take place annually.The service were always up to par. Once they got my friend the wrong drink, and we were in a hurry so he took the wrong drink instead of waiting for them to make another one. They barista offered him two gift cards that he can use to exchange for a free drink of any size in any Starbucks.It's not really the drink that we are paying in a Starbucks cafe, it is indeed the service.
1	Doesn't compare to America. Go on, give me some hate.
4	Location, location, locationAtmosphere: This is a very cool little Starbucks.  On the corder St. Catherine and Crescent, it provides patrons with a unique opportunity to sip on java and watch Montreal pass by.  From the revellers  (with their tiny-tiny dresses and sky-high heels in mid-winter!) on Crescent street, to the boisterous Habs fans on their way to the Bell Centre, it's all on display.Service:  I've never had bad service here ~ and I've been a customer for over 7 years.  The training the new recruits  receive must include a major debriefing on how to continue the legacy of being awesome!Food: Standard menu, but I find that the deserts on offer are a little fresher than other places. Perhaps due to the heavy traffic this outlet receives.Fun place & very convieniently located!
4	Friendly staff, ample seating.
4	Service was great and English speaking. The coffee was hot and the muffins were very fresh. Starbucks never disappoints.
