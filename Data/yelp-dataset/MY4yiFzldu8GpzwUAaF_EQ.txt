4	The church itself is beautiful and the people were pleasant.  I have gone twice.  The services were quick and a bit different than what I am used to but none the less a nice experience.  The only thing was the choice of sermon topics at both services was kind of strange, almost seemingly on the verge of inappropriate.  Nazis, their cruel ways and torturing of people isn't exactly a choice I would have gone with, but to each his own. I think he got the point accross though.  Even if you don't attend a mass I definitely recommend you at least stop inside and check out the architecture.  Beautiful
