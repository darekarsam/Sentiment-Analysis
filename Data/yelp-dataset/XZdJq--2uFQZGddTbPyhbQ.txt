2	Samosa's(2), naan bread(1), chicken curry, butter chicken, and rice cost $36.10 before tip. The serving size of the chicken for both plates could've been bigger that's for sure. Curry sauce WAYYY to liquidy. I enjoyed the meal however but won't order there again.
3	The food is very good. Naan is perfect, Lamb Korma was the dish I tried I likes it, but the size of their dishes is not acceptable for the price they charge (when you order by phone or online you get more food, but two times I went to dine in there the dishes were so small that made me to go for an additional naan.
