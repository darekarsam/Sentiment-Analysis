4	One of the nicest coffee shops on campus. Seating is haphazard:  a large number of teeny-tiny tables and a few larger tables that would be nice for group work, but are typically monopolized by a solitary and grumpy looking person. Lighting is good though. People here tend towards the quiet, so if you come here to chat, expect angry looks. Can't comment on the coffee (I hear it is good), but for those of us who don't like coffee, this is the place. Tea is high quality and the chai is fantastic, unlike Royale's Chai, which is watered down and awful.  They also have gelato here, but the Crepe Cafe's gelato far surpasses it.
5	I joined yelp just so I could provide a counter-review to the one by Tom. It's not that I don't believe him, it's just that I think that is far from the average experience there; he probably had the misfortune to get someone who just started working there or somesuch.Let me tell you, I love Bar Guiliani. The only drawback is that like many of the cafe's in town, it's only open til 11 at night, because I would glady stay there to study and drink their coffee all night if I could.Why? Because their coffee is spectacular, and I love little independently-owned coffee shops, especially ones that have nice employees, awesome seating for studying students, and as I mentioned, some fairly kickass coffee. (With REALLY pretty cups if you're not taking it 'to go!')I do agree with Melissa that most people there are fairly quiet, but at the same time it's not unwelcome to talk with others as long as you're not obnoxiously loud and you try not to sit next to a group of studiers (which is easy to avoid, since there's so much seating)
4	Fantastic coffee! Beats the Espresso Royale chain any day and has a great atmosphere (feels like a real cafe). GF loves the hot chocolate with peppermint as well. Don't listen to reviewer, for the quality you are getting you should let them do it their way...
