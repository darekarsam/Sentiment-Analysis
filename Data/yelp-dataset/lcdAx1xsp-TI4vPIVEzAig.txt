2	Laser quest is a fun experience for kids of all ages, but the adults that play at this establishment, honestly kind of creep me out.  The best time to bring your children here is during the middle of the week, because there is always an abundance of birthday parties on the weekend, and it can take hours before you are able to participate.  Each game is about fifteen minutes long and the setup is fairly large, with many areas to run around and attack friends.  Bring your childhood self here for a good clean time!

2	Recently had my son's 9th birthday party here.Staff is super nice but the overall facilities are small and lacking for a child's birthday party.There is not an area for adults to sit while kids are in the laser tag area.No assistance is provided in the 'party room' for distributing drinks, pizza, etc.No hand sanitizer provided for the kids prior to eating.The employee at the front desk said "we just use soap to clean our hands the old fashion way." Ok, but the bathroom soap dispensers were empty.We've had parties at Sports Connection that are fantastic.Lesson learned and will continue to have Sports Connection host.The location is great for small groups of Teens or Adults.Just don't expect much for a child's party.Once again the staff was very nice and polite.
