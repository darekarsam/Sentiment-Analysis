4	We (my bf and I) stayed here a few weeks ago when we were in montreal for the weekend. It was by far one of the best hostels I've been to in north america. They have taken something from the european and australian hostels and added some genuine montreal charm. The price was reasonable, the place clean - the staff was really friendly and helpful. Excellent kitchen and common area set up. They even had a local band play one evening when we were there - all in all a great place!
5	I recommend this place highly. Kitchen area is wide open, comfortable, and there is a lot of room to store food. It's in a great location in old Montreal and is very quiet at night.  Very homey. Staff is lovely. Free towels, sheets, and fair trade coffee.  Bathrooms are clean and comfortable. Rooms are small, like any hostel, but lockers are spacious. Expect to pay 25-26 dollars a night. Very worth it!
5	I had a wonderful stay in Montreal, thanks to our friends at the Auberge Alternative!This hostel is situated in a very safe (and cool!) part of town, and it's very accessible to restaurants, bars and the metro.This place is very hip- everything is painted in cute colors. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I stayed here with two other people, and we got a private room on the top floor- I would highly recommend this! The 'family' room has two huge windows with massive window sills that you can sit on, overlooking the streets. We were extremely comfortable there.Everything seemed clean. The free breakfast was a hit. They even have a washer and dryer in the hostel, which was awesome because we arrived halfway through our roadtrip with a ton of dirty clothes.I would definitely recommend this place! Very chill. Just keep in mind, you must pay in Canadian cash for your stay.
