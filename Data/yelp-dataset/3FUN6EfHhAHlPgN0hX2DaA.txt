4	I've never taken the time to write a positive review for a "fast food" establishment, but this one deserves a tip of the hat. Was passing through Peoria on business with a family member and stopped here for a quick bite. The restaurant was especially clean and well maintained, service was quick, food was good, and the manager "Mark" was extremely friendly and even entertaining. There's a bell by the door you can ring on your way out if you had a good experience, which I took advantage of after seeing another patron do it on their way out. Not a typical "fast food" experience for me, and thought worth noting!
5	Very clean, nicely decorated and friendly servers
