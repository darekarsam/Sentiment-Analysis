4	This place is twice as big on the inside as it appears from the outside.  In addition to the main showroom, which is organized loosely by type of stuff (beaded handbags, silver, china, military decorations, that kind of category), there are about 10 little rooms off to the side that are set up like as the room of the person whose estate the stuff in the room came from.  There's lots of actual GOOD STUFF which actually outnumbers the amount of the usual stupid antique store dusty crap. I am going to go back soon and buy a bookshelf I saw.  Highly recommended.
5	Unfortunately, this gem of a store is closing. However, everything is now 50% off which is amazing. They have truly beautiful pieces of classic furniture and accessories. Seriously, I've been schooling myself on interior design for the past month (i.e. obsessively reading the blogs of top designers) and when I walked in here last weekend I was in HEAVEN!
4	Ugh I was so sad to hear this place is closing, or maybe already has since I've been in town. I went here a few times when moving into my new (very empty) downtown apartment and I snagged some really awesome silver antler candlestick holders and a really excellent cow-hide rug. Mind you, this is after I spent hours LOST in this place. They really do have something for every taste, even for my mid-century furniture loving self. Of course, the prices are steep but these are real, high-quality antiques, nearly all of which were in good condition.
