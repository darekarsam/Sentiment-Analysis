2	Internet connection in the room did not work.  Repeated calls to the ISP and front desk resulted in no repair over several days.  Scottish breakfast was adequate.  Awful location if touring Edinburgh.  Horribly over-priced given the lesser advertised opportunities closer to city center.
2	There are two holiday inn in Edinburgh. Holiday inn at queensferry road is not bad. But service is not so good considering price. Moreover breakfast and wifi is not included. Food is very slow at lunch and dinner. One thing good is to use two devices if you use wifi. Last, downtown is not far (about 8 pound distance by taxi).
