5	I love this library. The staff is super friendly and the large kid area is a zero cost method for the kiddos to have a blast!  Peoria also has these cultural passes at the front which gives you 2 free tickets to popular area attractions. Great way to spend quality family time without wasting away money!
5	Wow! A few weeks ago I was wondering "who still goes to a library?" Little did I know what great kids programs that libraries offer. I took my baby here for a play group and it was great. We sang songs, had bubbles, and tons of toys to play with. There was even parachute time. Now I am wondering why I am even paying for gymboree when this is offered for free.The library also has a great kids section with tons of books, computers, toys, and an outside play area. This is the place to go to bring your kids. I am so excited to check out the other classes!
2	I love this library, but the workers can be incredibly rude. There is a few great workers at the library, but a few too many who have ruined my experience at this library and make me flirt with not coming back ever again. They are rude, don't listen to the guests at the library, and nothing adds up. Some librarians will let you do things while others won't and I'm absolutely sick of it. Besides some workers, everything is great.
5	Always clean, quiet. Great selection of DVDs and CDs. Great indoor/outdoor play area for kids.
4	If, like us, you've always wanted to stand beside the guardian lions on the steps.just do it and then enter and ascend to the upper floors.to explore the reading rooms.in all of their glory.The reading rooms of Sunrise Mountain Library are impressive in the extreme,but there's something about Peoria fabled library that will live with you long after you'veleft. That's a good thing.
