1	Absolutely AWFUL Service!!! Good luck getting an appointment!!! I got a groupon for a massage a couple of months ago. Over the past couple of months, I have called this business at least 4 times and left voice mails and sent 2 emails to schedule an appointment. Nobody responded. When I sent an email confirming that I would report them to groupon and the BBB if they did not contact me within 48 hours, I finally was able to make contact. She suggested Sunday Nov 2nd but I told her I was going to be at the Dunes that weekend and we agreed on October 26th. I turned up for the appointment. I was 10 minutes early. Nobody was there. I waited 25 minutes, she did not turn up. There was another lady who was also waiting for a 12pm appointment and said she too has had problems with this business in the past. I cannot be responsible for the fact that Jeanette, the owner is not able to schedule appointments competently. I have spent so much time and effort trying to get a massage. I don't want to waste any more time chasing and don't feel this business is worthy of my money. I can only imagine receiving a malicious, harsh massage because of my persistence.
1	This place is awful.  I bought a package for massages which they have refused to honor and refuse to refund my money.  They either double book, don't show up or show up late.  Do not go here.
1	Like the other reviewers, we have had a horrible time trying to make an appointment.  After complaining to Groupon, we were able to finally set an appointment.  What a surprise, they never showed up!    Maybe the common theme is, crappy service for Groupon customers?
