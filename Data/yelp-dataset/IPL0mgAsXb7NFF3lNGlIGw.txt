4	Fresh mom and pop sushi local in Kirkland.  Really yummy - I have the stamp cards to prove it.  It's always busy at lunch and dinner times.  If you live in the area it's worth the trip.
5	Mom and pop shop with very friendly owners. I go at least once a week for lunch and the quality is always consistent. My favorite roll is the spring maki with wafu sauce, it's so good!!
5	Great sushi and very reasonable prices.We eat there and order their platters for parties also.
