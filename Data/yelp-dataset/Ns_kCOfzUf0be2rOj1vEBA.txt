5	The best service of any convenience store. This one is on par, for me, with Carleton Ave Grocery (Georgetown, WA). (Check my other reviews)
4	Wow! What a hidden gem! This is a convenience store with a good selection of beer and they make quality fast mexican food in the store. The chicken street tacos are great for late night. Good portions of very good quality ingredients. They serve 'til 2:00am!
4	These guys are great. A little corner shop reminiscent of the bodegas of my native East Coast (that have delis inside) . These guys have a taco stand inside that has some of the best mexican food around IMO. The ingredients they use are top notch. Very tasty, very clean. Diamond in the rough.
4	They have a dude making burritos, pipes, booze, condoms, beanies, and more. They put the convenient in convenience store.I just wrote their jingle.
