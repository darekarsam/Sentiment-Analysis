3	Enjoyed the lunch but service is slow. Glad to see an updated menu, wish dinner was offered.
5	Brought my 2 boys for their first ever time on a golf course. We had a great time. The staff was very friendly. One guy offered to take our picture since it was their first time golfing. The course is perfect for the beginning golfer or to play with kids. Very affordable too. Kids were only $10 for 18 holes. Will play there again.
5	Consistently nice views on this short course make it one of my favorites - Superstition Mountain, fall leaves, clear ponds, and blooming Flowers. Many, 13,  par 3 holes provide plenty of opportunities for the elusive hole-in-one. Right after over seeding the greens are slow but generally they are pleasantly fast and well-kept for the rest of the season. The driving range as well as putting and chipping practice areas are conveniently located. Nov. 2014 has new golf shop and expanded restaurant with special events.
