5	A great family business. They are a pleasure to work with and very good at problem solving.
1	Not happy at all with the prints this company did for us.  I would not recommend them to anyone.  Very unprofessional and they just did not care that I was unhappy.
5	Thysse Printing is the best! Their sales staff is friendly and helpful, the quality of their print jobs is unmatched and they always make sure you get your project on time and 100% to your satisfaction. Would recommend them to anyone looking for a printer that will make their life easier and that's coming from a graphic designer of ten years.
