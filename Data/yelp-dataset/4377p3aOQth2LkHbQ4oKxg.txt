5	I was in a car accident about 10 months ago and a friend referred me to attorney Lew Moore.  I had been in an accident years ago and had hired another firm (I won't say which, but they have a lot of ads on tv) and I didn't realize what bad service I got until I worked with this new firm.  Working with attorney Moore and his team was an amazing experience and a far cry from my experience with the other law firm.  What I liked most is they actually cared about what was going on with me and they knew exactly what the status of my case was at all times.  I feel like they went above and beyond to look into every aspect of my life that was affected by my injuries from the accident.  My case just got finished...my bills are getting paid and I'm walking away with more money than I ever expected I would.  Very happy!
5	This is the most comprehensive, helpful and hard working of any law office I have come by, and there have been many.  I am so thrilled with the outcome of my case.  I got the care I needed, which was a worry.  They truly cared about my recovery from injury and fighting to get me the compensation I needed and deserved.  I highly recommend Lew Moore and his amazing paralegal Kristen!
5	I so appreciate this law office's prompt, friendly help!  I had been elsewhere, and didn't have my car accident-case resolved.  Moore Injury Law completed everything in a few months!  They were respectful, efficient and genuine.  Thanks again!
5	These guys are awesome!  I'm so glad I hired them for my car accident case!  I can tell they worked really hard on my case and negotiated really strong to get me a fantastic result.  Great job here guys!
