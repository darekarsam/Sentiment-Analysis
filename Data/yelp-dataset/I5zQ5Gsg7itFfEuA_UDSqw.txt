5	First time at this dog park. Looking for a place closer and came across this on the internet. Showed up at 7 am and we were the only ones there. It was very, very clean. Grass was well maintained, and the landscaping around the fencing was well kept. Benches are around the outside for owners to relax with trees that would provide some shade. It looked as if there was lights around the outside during night hours. There was plenty of tennis balls but recommend bring your own toys. I wore out my golden lab throwing the ball from one side to the other in about an hour. Nice place to take the pups and let them run free without worry of running off, or breaking the leash law in public. I believe this time would've been more enjoyable if my dogs had others to run with, but all in all, very good time. Hope to see more and more dogs there once the weather cools off and word spreads about this nice dog park.
5	my dogs have so much fun here!!!!    The people are all nice too.    My dogs are so tired after being here because they live if.
5	I bring my 30 pound mixed breed to this pocket park practically every single day. We love it here the owners seem to be very mindful of their dogs behaviors and are quick to leash if their Dog gets unruly. Everyone seems to be really good about picking up after their animal. I love that people bring their kids! There's always one or two people that can tend to ruin it for everyone at times but overall I have had nothing but good things to say about this park!
