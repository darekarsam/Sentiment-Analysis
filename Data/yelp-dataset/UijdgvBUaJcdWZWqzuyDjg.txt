3	This Subway is located inside the WalMart in World Famous Queen(tucky) Creek. What a great place to get a good/fast quality sandwich on the go!  Whats even better is I always seem to have a coupon! SCORE!!! Try the Tuna Salad on the honey oat bread with Jalapenos. Yummy!!!
2	Anytime you go to a walmart Subway they are just greedy with the meat!!! my daughter 3" sub gets one slice of ham and one pepperoni.....really? I do like the fact that they added a the most unhealthly snack right next to subway here LOL so bring on the angel and demon on each shoulder.....what should I eat? Subway here gets 2 stars the people here just act like walmart employees they dont wanna be here and they are just greedy with the meat. There are better option near by.
1	Came to this restaurant, and got me a salad. Needless to say I found several hairs in my food. Well ! That totally grossed me out. Brought it to the attention of the associate, was told I would have to return tomorrow cause Kathy the manager wasn't there. Asked, do you have a store manager. This black kid working there screams out, YOU WERE TOLD TO COME BACK. It's not like I was asking for my money back, I work in the restaurant business. We are told as associates to assist the customer, offer a replacement. This has happened to me twice here, I gave them another chance. If you don't want the hassle of being told to come back, don't come here. Firehouse is across the parking lot, they always ask me if I like my meal. If not, they will replace it, or give me something else. Now this is customer service. I will not be returning to subways
