3	This location just opened about a week ago, I stopped in for one of their ready-to-go Pepperoni pizza's for $5.  Should have checked it before I left, a good portion of the pizza was one of those strange burnt dough bubbles.  Oh well, it was $5 and covered a dinner and 2 lunches.  Maybe I'll pay the extra $1.50 next time to have one made fresh.

So I was coming home one night and I remember that I forgot to leave something out for dinner so I thought let's give this place a try. It's not to be confused with gourmet pizza but for $5 it's hard to go wrong. I had the pepperoni and it was ok. It was cool that it was ready so quickly. If you're looking for a quick bite give it a try.
1	Third time in a row no pizza ready waiting as it use to be.Always have to wait it use to be fast now you just wait.Going to start going to a different one.
