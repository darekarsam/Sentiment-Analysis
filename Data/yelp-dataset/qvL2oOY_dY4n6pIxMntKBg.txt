1	If you're a guy this is the place to go to get a screwed up haircut. Thank The Lord I always wear a hat cause if the general public saw my haircut they would run away like the Asians run from Godzilla. I never understood why people pay 30-40 bucks for a haircut until I went here. I highly would recommend a Man never go here.
3	Ok it's Great clips. It's different every time you go but generally the people are friendly and want to do well. If your haircut isn't complicated you should be fine
