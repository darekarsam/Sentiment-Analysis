1	Had a reservation, waited an hour and a half. Asked for compensation for the wait because no one offered anything while we were waiting. The owner offered to pay for all our drinks and then when the bill came, charged us for the drinks we ordered. The table sitting next to us called out the owner and expressed that they too, heard that the owner had said he could pay for our drinks given our long wait. I have never been spoken to the way in which this owner had spoke to me, especially with a reservation.While the food was good, I would never want anyone to support such a disrespectful man.
1	not worth the cost of the plate! paid 38$ for a chicken on a plate. no sauce and the vegtables were put on a side plate to share amongst 5 people! i was shocked!. high prices for no reason and waited forever to get served.
