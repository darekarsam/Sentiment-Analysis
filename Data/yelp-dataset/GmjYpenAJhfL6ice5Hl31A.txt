5	A little Zen in the city coreCoffee shops for me are not about grab and go. They are about sitting back and relaxing in a comfy chair with a warm brew and a sweet treat.So I was really thrilled when this chain shop renovated and brought in the atmosphere! The new look reminded me of Veritas -- the stores are not related except that they are both coffee shops. Big easy chairs, plenty of reading material in English and French, and delectable goodies to go with simply good coffee. Ask for your stampie card and collect towards a free coffee!This outlet also sells sandwiches and salads. On a nice day there are tables out on the sidewalk.
1	The customer service in this place is so bad, it deserves to be boycotted. They will let you wait and wait and wait to use the washroom, telling you somebody else is in there, when in reality they just lost the key. I waited 1/2 hour, until profuse knocking made me certain no one was in the washroom. I watched while the worker told several other people that 'someone is already in there'. I saw one person waiting for 10 minutes, until I finally informed that person that she was waiting for nothing. Pathetic.
3	This place is cute for quick bite, but nothing special. They have a variety of sandwiches, salads, pastries and beverages. We had a the chicken and sun dried tomato pressewich and the salad with the strawberries and blueberries. Good, but not awesome. Friendly service and a nice atmosphere are a plus.
