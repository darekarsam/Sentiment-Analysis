2	I wanted to get some baloons so I stoped by Party City. I chose what I wanted and asked for them to fill it with helium but it would cost me 69 cents per balloon. I did not realize that they charge for it and what's crazy is that it cost more than the balloons itself. I wouldn't mind paying 10-15 cents each but 69 cents? That's just not right! I left and went to Walmart and they blow up 25 balloons free of charge. The balloons were cheaper as well.That's call GREAT customer service! Sorry Party City I will not be your frequent customer as I once was!
5	Great service and selection!
1	I put in an order for some balloons and they wouldn't transfer my order to a different location.  They said I would have to drive out to the other location and do a return and they redo a new order that this location.  In a computer aged world where retailers are hurting you think they would have a way for their systems to work together.  Not very convenient.  Is this really suppose to be one company?  They sure don't act like it.
