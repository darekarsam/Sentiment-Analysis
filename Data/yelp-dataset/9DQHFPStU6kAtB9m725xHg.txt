5	Even though I arrived with little time to spare and the staff were up ladders and in the window fixing display, I couldn't have asked for better service. They kept my items and I came back when it suited me better.....and found yet another piece: a great striped and stretchy skirt perfect for cycling even. Good news didn't stop there, as I got another sum off the skirt by the time I paid. Well done to the nicest shop for tall ladies.ps - if you have big feet they also have a good range now and again
