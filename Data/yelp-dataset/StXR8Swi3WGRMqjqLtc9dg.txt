4	First!!Anyways, its nice decent Tims. Coffee way better than any other place on the planet. The location itself is decent. Its not the newest (and therefore nicest/cleanest) but i've seen far worse (ie. downtown toronto ones that smell like urine).  The place is also very heavily staffed, so u get ur stuff FAST.
1	This is the worst Tim hortons I've ever been. They constantly mess up everything and are too lazy to even stir a coffee. Don't even think of ordering any food because if it isn't a donut; they will mess it up. They only hire people that are clearly stupid and can only manage to work at a Tim hortons for the rest of their life. I have never encountered more ignorant, idiotic employees.
2	This place makes me want to put my dick in a panenni press....how hard is it to toast a bagel and stir a coffee??? Jeeze, everyone who is involved with the drive thru is hard of hearing and are constantly fucking up orders and screaming their names through the speaker, Donna, relax girl. I don't give a fuck what your name is just make my coffee and shit right....
