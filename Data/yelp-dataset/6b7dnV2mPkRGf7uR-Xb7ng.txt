5	Long story short: I get medication here all the time at a great price and when I had to visit Target to have a prescription filled-  it was 300% more expensive.  Customer service is so polite and personable.  Plus, I've heard from a bunch of people that the lady who owns it is super kind-hearted so that's always a plus.
1	Good luck trying to get a question answered by a pharmacist. My call was misdirected twice and when I finally did reach the pharmacy I was met with rudeness. I'll be taking my prescription elsewhere even though I live within blocks.
