5	Very Friendly and Knowledgeable. Found the perfect Slot Machine for my dad for his Birthday. Brandon (the owner) gave me all the details on the machine and even offered to convert it coins down the road when my dad wants it done.Their pricing is INCREDIBLE! I had searched everywhere, craigslist, ebay and other retailers and for the same machine i was finding Colson Gaming was the best price and the best machine.They offer local delivery and the delivered SAME DAY.I highly recommend them and will be a returning customer.
5	I though slot machines where expensive, but not at Colson Gaming. I went in looking for my favorite slot machine, Triple Lucky 7's. I was surprised they had it. Brandon was very knowledgeable about the gaming industry. I'm sure he could open his own casino if it was allowed.
5	Excellent selection and customer service. I'm very happy with my purchase so far.
5	If you want to be met with friendly service and a staff that is extremely knowledgeable then this is the place to go.  Not is this store clean, but they have the best prices around.
5	Nice environment. Friendly knowledgable staff that provide great customer service. The best place for a casino lover to buy that special gift. Great selection to pick from.
5	Knowledgeable, friendly staff and reasonable priced. I would definitely buy from them again.
