5	Dobbies is pretty awesome, and super addictive.  I first came here because I'm big into my garden and someone mentioned that it's a good place to buy plants.  Is it EVER.  It's massive.  It's huge inside - full of indoor plants, animals, fish, furniture, gifts, tack, etc, but the outside is so big I've not even seen it all.  Outside you will find TONS of different types of plants, a whole section of grow your own fruit/veg, trees, green houses, garden decorations, compost, summer houses, sheds, and CHICKENS AND DUCKS!!  Despite looking, I've never seen the chickens and ducks because the place really is that massive.Almost better than the size is the fact that it's pretty reasonably priced and the plants are well tended and very healthy.Our primary reason for coming here in the winter months is defiintely the market hall.  It's got a little section of locally grown produce, nice cured meats and cheeses, top end beers, wines and spirits, great flavoured oils and vinegars, a fabulous butcher section, and then basically all of that really pretty and expensive food stuff that you tend to get for gifts but would never buy for yourself because it's expensive and really not that practical.  I heard from a friend recently that they host kids' parties here as well which are pretty reasonably priced and *really* well done.  Dobbies literally has something for everyone and is in itself a fun day out just to look around and do a bit of exploring.  It's kind of like Ikea for families and gardeners.
