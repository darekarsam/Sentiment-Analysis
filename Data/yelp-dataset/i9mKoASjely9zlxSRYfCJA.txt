4	Food was like any other subway. Best thing was the atmosphere that the employees brought. No matter how busy it got they still engaged with their customers . Employees had good communication with each other as well
5	24 hr subway. Greeted by a really nice employee.. was super generous with the veggies, and though we ordered two separate 6in sandwiches (it was the same sandwich, just different bread), was charged as only as one footlong. First time in Vegas where I finally feel like I'm coming out ahead! Woohoo!
1	Slowest subway ever on earth. People are nice here but i come to subway to grab my sub and rush out but not waut in line for 15 min for you toprepare just 3 subs.
