4	Go to their FB page to find out what's going on.  Something going on 7 days a week.It's not an upscale fancy place, it's just a nice little venue for a good time.  Nice older crowd, good ole school music.  Staff was friendly.  I think everyday is free admission except for comedy night.  I'm not sure the cost or what day comedy night is.  Call for details.

It's pretty dark inside with black floors and black walls makes it feels like you're walking into a haunted house , you're waiting for someone to jump out at ya. It is pretty small and could use a little TLC inside. It's not too bad of a place I didn't really feel uncomfortable or anything, the area surroundings is not in a great spot.
