1	I am not a believer.  The biggest thing this place has going for it is location because you can easily get on 215 East from Durango, but there are a few problems...I leave for work between 0345 and 0430.  On more than one occassion it has been closed for no apparent reason.  The last time there was an employee inside, sitting stoic, didn't make eye contact with me.Second issue is price.  They are consistently $.08-.12 higher per gallon than the Shell across the street.  Shell is not cheap gas!  If it were a Rebel, it would make more sense.Third is the actually employees.  They have some really interesting people working there.  I am pretty sure they don't drug test.  They are in no way friendly and the service is pretty bad!
4	Friendly staff if you come here alot they will order items that you're looking for i.e. energy drinks and power bars. Only issue I have is the car wash
1	Had to come here to fill up my gas can because I ran out of gas on the freeway and so when I was filling up my ga can an employee ran outside and told me that can't fill up gas cans at our station and the employee pulled the nozzle and place it back on the pump and told me to leave. Worst experience I had ever had with any gas station. I'm from Ohio and me and my family were heading to red rock national park. DO NOT GO TO THIS STATION.
1	I've tried to give this gas station a chance three times. Their receipt machines NEVER work. Don't go here if you have to save receipts.
2	the store looked awesome.....the kid behind the counter was super annoying !!!!!!!!He must have been like 19 or 20.....trying to test me on gas mileage and math....im a 32 year old grow woman who just got off work, all i wanted was a few bucks in gas and be on my way....NOT be on 'are you smarter then a gas attended' game show....really turned me off....
