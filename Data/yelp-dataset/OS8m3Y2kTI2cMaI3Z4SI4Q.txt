3	What can i say, a sports store that focuses on my favorite sport - hockey!   good selection of sticks and other hockey gear.   Family run business and the good service to proves it.
1	My family came into the store about 30 minutes prior to closing hoping to get some ice skates. There were at least 10 employees wandering the floor or hanging out at the front. Not a single one asked if we needed assistance. We found the skate section, where an employee was helping another customer. We waited there until he was finished, so that we could get some advice on picking skates. He walked right past us and never asked if we needed assistance. The only time anyone in the store spoke to us was to tell us they were closing. The only reason we chose a speciality store was to get some sound advice. You might as well go to a big box store and pay half the price with the quality of service here.
