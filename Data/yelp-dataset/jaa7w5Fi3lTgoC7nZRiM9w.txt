2	The staff is rough as all heck. Unprofessional and unfriendly and unwilling to bag your groceries or do anything to go out of their way.  Other Lowe's are way more courteous, clean, and approachable  Convenience and speedier check out is the only reason to shop here.
4	All I can say is I wish it was closer.  Love this place way more than the staple grocer of Charlotte (Teeter). Much more moderately priced, and more options in my experience. My biggest complaint about this place is the produce, it is very spotty. Some times its great, and looks very fresh. Other times it looks like they are trying to sell off the stuff right before its shelf life gives in. Otherwise, the employees have always been helpful, and friendly. When coming here weekly we ended up with a "regular" cashier, and "its always nice to go where someone knows your name."  =)
4	I love Lowe's. Everyone is so helpful and I like how they email you deals and tips that you like according to what you purchase at the store.
4	Shopped here a few times when it was Lowes Foods, but never really was a fan. I  never could find the low prices everyone spoke of; when they did run sales it was never for things I needed. Now it has reopened as a Harris Teeter and that's fine with me. The retrofit was done very nicely, the produce section in particular looks great; nice selection of organics. The only minor quibble I have about the Teeters is that each one is laid out slightly differently, which can make it a bit more time consuming finding items if you stop by different stores. They are staffed for bear this weekend; everyone is almost as bubbly as if it were a Trader Joes. Almost. 10% of everything this weekend with your Vic card, so check it out if you're in the area this weekend.
