4	LOVE LOVE LOVE the samosas! That's all I'm rating them on, they are so worth it! I've thad them twice now during the food truck event at the Olympic stadium and I'm always trying to track them down around the city.At 2$ a piece, these delectable samosas are plump, generous, not greasy, lightly spiced and oh so good with the tamarind sauce. What a satisfying mouthfeel!I'm taking 1 star off because they wouldn't offer a discount if I bought them in larger quantities and when I inquired about their schedule of events on Facebook, the owner, who runs the page, read my message but never got back to me!
