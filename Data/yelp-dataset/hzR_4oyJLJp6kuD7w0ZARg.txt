3	In Michigan, you can purchase beer at the grocery store. In Pennsylvania you have to visit "beer world". The good thing about beer world was they had Yuengling beer in 24 packs and a great selection of other beers. Now you have to purchase them in huge quantities but when you are looking to transport it back a couple states at least it makes your trip to the store worth it.
4	Mainly i say its just another beer store accept for one HUGE detail which caused me to drive all the way across the city to go there.  At a high rate of speed i might add.THEY SELL MIDDLESWARTH BBQ CHIPS!Incredible.  I've never seen them in the entire western half of the state!  What a miracle!  Thank you so much Beer World!And heres the point you wonder.  Whats the big deal?  They're just BBQ chips.  And thats also the point where you veer way wrong.  These chips transcend reality to transport you to a special potato chip heaven.  Try them.  And Support Beer World for stocking them.Three cheers for Beer World:Hip Hip Horray, Hip Hip Horray, Hip Hip Horray!can you tell i love these chips?
3	As an out-of-stater at Beer World, I was kinda mystified that they had only cases of beer: lots and lots and lots of cases of many, many kinds of beer.  I didn't understand the reasoning behind the lack of 6-packs and 12-packs until speaking with the cashier.  In Pennsylvania, you can only buy 6-packs at bars, or other special situations.  So, be prepared to buy in bulk.  One other thing: they'll have you fill out a little slip of paper with some basic info if you have an out-of-state ID, so you may have to do a little paperwork before you leave with a lot of beer.  But hey, a lot of beer means one fewer trip to the store, eh?  The employees were friendly and understanding of our bewilderment to these practices.
