3	For the Beer Store nearby, Liquor Villa is OK.  Occasional specials offset some prices that are just a little high.  For beer, the prices are on par with AM/PM or 7-11, tho the selection is smaller.  For wine and spirits, good selection, by and large reasonable pricing and it's quick to get in and out of the store.Friday and Saturday, they are open until 2 AM and other nights until midnight.A nice find for that "gotta grab a beer" on my way home from work kind of evening.
2	Semi sketch storeThey have an "OK" selection but not muchCustomer service is okay tooNothing much to write about
