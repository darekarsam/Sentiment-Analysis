3	This is a very small branch and it is very oddly shaped. I guess they started out with a skinny strip of land and the builder did the best he/she could to make it work. The staff is friendly. I appreciate the good customer service. It's always a fairly quick stop if I have to go inside.
3	This is the B of A I frequent the most. I mainly use the ATM for deposits and withdrawels. They do multiple check deposits which speeds up the deposits process. There have been a few instances when the ATM was down but that has been maybe 3 times in 7 years. Occasionally, I have had to go in and the customer service has been great. theres never been a line and the employees have always been very helpful.
