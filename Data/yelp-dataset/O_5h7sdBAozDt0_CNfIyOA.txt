5	We had our older minivan towed in for repairs, and judging by the symptoms, we feared that it would require a new or rebuilt transmission for major money.  Lorenzato discovered that the problem wasn't the transmission at all, and the repair costs were nowhere near the total we were bracing for!  They had us back in business in a day and a half and she runs just fine again.It's very reassuring to find an honest repair shop on your first visit!  Rich was a really pleasant guy, and when I mentioned that we lived only a few miles away, he even offered to pick me up from home if I ever needed a ride down to pick up a vehicle!  Class act, through and through.
5	I have gone to Richy since he opened his business in 1981, and know that he is a man of integrity.  He has built his reputation on old fashioned values, and would never jeopardize his stellar name in the automotive world for any amount of money.  I am shocked at a comment from spring of this year, and wish to defend this business and the morals, values, and foundation that brought it to where it is today.  This man could never be a "rip off artist" because he does not know that behavior, and it would be totally out of character for him to act in such a way.  The person that made the comment clearly did not understand that an insurance adjuster evaluates damage, and issues a payment for the damages to be repaired.  That payment is to pay the automotive shop to repair the vehicle for the damages from the accident, and not for extra items (such as painting an entire vehicle).  My recommendation is to take your business to Lorenzato Automotive (and ignore the negative comment) if you want to take your car to someone that you can trust.  Treating you like family is what this guy offers.....UNEQUIVOCABLY.
