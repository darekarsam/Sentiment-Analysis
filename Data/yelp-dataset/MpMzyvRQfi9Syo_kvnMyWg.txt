5	I thought this store was called Le Petite Garconne because that is what it says in the store on the wall and in the window, but apparently they are owned by the same company. Anyways, I loved this shop so much! Really great pieces for very surprising prices! I was visiting Montreal from the US and I couldn't believe what amazing deals they had for the quality pieces they sold. I will be definitely shopping online from their stores. If you are in the St Laurent area, this was my favorite boutique and it is a must see for any woman shopping in the area.
5	I received the most outstanding customer service I've ever received at this store! The saleswomen at this store were extremely friendly, professional, and went out of their way to help me today. The selection is wonderful, but I most especially appreciated all of the attentive service. I'll definitely be back soon. Thank you!!!!
