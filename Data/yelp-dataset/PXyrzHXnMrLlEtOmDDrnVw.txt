5	Family run, personal and wonderful service.  You feel welcomed - they know their customers and they go the extra mile.  Spotlessly clean, Sonny and Hanna his wife make sure your nails and pedicure was the best.   I especially love the solar nails and the spa pedicure. Best place in the Castle Shannon and Mount Lebanon area

4	My favorite nail salon in the South Hills.  Best pedicure I've ever had.  I used to live near by, but have since moved further away.  I make a special trip to come to this spot.
5	I've gone to a couple other places, but this was hands down the most pleasant experience I've ever had at a nail salon.  I've honestly never had a good nail salon experience so I feel that I really have to write a good one here!Everyone was so nice.  Sonny, the owner, told me that he loves his job because he gets the chance to get to know people - it's not just about money.  And it is evident in the work and the atmosphere here. I got a shellac manicure and pedicure and it was simply amazing.  So relaxing.  I want to go back all the time - they really take care of you.  Highly, highly recommend!
4	Had a good experience here!  Tonya was extremely kind and professional.  The owner Sonny was nice and we felt very comfortable here.  I would return!
