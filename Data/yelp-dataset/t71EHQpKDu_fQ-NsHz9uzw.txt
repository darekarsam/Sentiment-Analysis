4	Reasonably priced sushi with reasonable quality for Montreal.  Their Chinese menu is pretty tasty.  I like most of their fried rices and noodles.  General  Tao chicken is good, too. Extra star for delivery!
5	Cheap, ... and nicely done overall!Nothing fancy but for a delivery in HoMa its as good as it gets.Ravioli Hunan are always my favourite here.Seems like an insignificant detail but its so fun to be understood quickly over the phone. They speak good french and english (and japanese I presume!)And that's an extra star for me.
4	Great General Tao. A few veggies wouldn't hurt... But the sauce was a perfect mild spicy. Will have to go back a try something different!
