1	Horrible location.  Lousy service. Manager is a jerk.  Won't accept coupons printed directly from Arby's official website.  I can't say enough bad about this particular location.  I love Arby's, but just avoid this location.
3	What can I say, it's close to my work and I've never had a problem with service or food quality at this location.  I'm not a huge hamburger fan, so I try and find something a little different on the days I have to grab a quick bite to eat for lunch.  I can't rate the lobby or interior as I've always gone through the drive through, but the food is hot and I don't think I've ever had a long wait in the drive through either.
4	I love Arby's.It's roast beef!And a bun!And curly fries!Haters be damned.
