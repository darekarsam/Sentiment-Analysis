4	The first lady that helped me was a tad ditzy, but at least she was nice.  Her boss also decided to help me.  I received some very good service here from these two ladies and they were able to answer all of my questions.  I came in looking for certain items.  I left with all of those items.  Good job!
5	I don't know about that Scott character.But overall I find this store to be well stocked, and the staff kind and courteous.I greatly appreciate the wide selection of high end dog purses and utlra stylish lawn kitsch. And I especially enjoy the soothing jams of bands like New Edition while I purchase my daily supply of condoms and scrunchies.
1	I went in here for stamps... it was a mistake.Walgreen's *DO* sell stamps, but when I went to this Walgreens the poor kid at the register barely knew what he was doing.There were other "associates" in the store, none of which were any help.He pulled out one sad book of stamps and most of the stamps were damaged.i would have bought 2 of 'em, just to not have the inconvenience of driving around trying to get stamps after post office hours, but this was not an option here.When the kid asked one of the other girls if they knew were more stamps were, one of the girls in the store yelled, "I'ont know, I ain't up 'ere today!"Yes.  Seriously.I won't return unless I'm on fire and need a bottle of water.
1	The pharmacist at this Walgreen's location is a HUGE jerk. Not helpful at all. Won't be visiting here again!!!
