5	I looove the cold matcha lattes here even a shot of mint gives it a nice kick.  Never had anything like it..My new fav coffee shop :) Wow, thanks for the overfilling my cup..very nice!
5	I go to this tea shop every week or so.The matcha lattes and lavendar lattes are to die for.It is a very peaceful place to have a relaxing drink, and to study as well.The baristas are very welcoming and polite. They have always given me suggestions on new drinks to try, and are always looking for a good conversation.Everyone should go to this place!
5	SUPER nice guy working here, recommended this fantastic tea. Also had some lovely kochi. Beautiful place with terrariums and a huuuuuge selection of teas.
5	I love this place so much. Finally a tea shop owner as obsessed with matcha tea as I am. This wonderful little tea shop offers plenty of tea options with a focus on the finest tea, matcha!  The owner is friendly and offers a personal experience to all of his clients as long as he has a free moment. It is very clean and really has a positive aura as soon as you walk in. I ordered a bananatcha (mix of matcha and banana) and it was great.  The owner filled my glass up to the top and once I took a few sips of my drink he came around and filled it up again. You have to love an experience like this. Can't wait to go back!
