4	Very nice small optical shop and opthamologist office. I got an eye exam and new contact lenses from them last fall and came back yesterday to get my new eyeglasses (take that, insurance!) and I got the most personal and professional service-because I was the only customer in there at the time! The 2 ladies staffing the office were helping me pick out my frames, bringing me frame after frame to try on and helped me decide which ones looked best on me and which would be best for my extremely heavy prescription. I'm terrible with getting peoples names but I do believe one of them was the one who did my exam last fall, Dr. Uelner.  They were also very knowledgableabout my insurance so that was a breeze. They're selection of frames is more designer than budget, but think of where their office is located, of course that's the case! Still, highly recommended!
4	Wow! What a nice group. My family and I have been coming to Dr Tiffany Uelner for nearly three years and found her and her staff to be excellent.
5	Good job
