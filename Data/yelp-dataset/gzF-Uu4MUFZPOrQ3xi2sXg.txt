5	Another excellent "fancy-pants" restaurant with good meat, wine, and everything. We ate here as a large group a few months back and broke the bank, but was worth every penny.
5	Continental Bistro. Awesome.
4	I'm not quite sure how to rate this restaurant. I gave it four stars, but I would've preferred to give it 3.5 stars. It's good, but not great. I find it just a little bit too expensive. You can eat just as well in other plateau restaurants, but for less money. Location is great. Service can be quite slow at times. They have two nice outdoor Terasse's upfront! All and all a good dining experience.
5	Amazing pork chop...as good as the best pork I've ever eaten.  Great Lobster salad.
4	I love this place. Try the fig carpaccio, the carbonara or the horse/beef tartar. A bit pricey but always a safe pick. Kitchen open late on week-end so it's always busy. Could also be fun to eat at the bar if you're dining alone.
