1	Disgusting place, poor attitudes, parking the worse! I took my daughter for a trim, got stuck with Ana, a person who makes it well known she is miserable and her life sucks! My kid spent less then 5 minutes in the chair, she looked the same when I brought her in, my worse issue is I left a $3 tip to this person.Stay away from this store, many other options, this place deserves to shut down for good.
4	Saira always does my hair. I don't even have to tell her what to do and she does a great job. It's fast and she provides pleasant conversation. All for a great price.
