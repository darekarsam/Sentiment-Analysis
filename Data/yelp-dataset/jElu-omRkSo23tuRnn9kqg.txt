4	You have to go into the Sherbrooke Metro Station to try out this place but trust me, you'll be glad that you did!  Its a very small, unassuming little shop but I can just see this as being where I would stop every morning for a pastry before jumping on the Metro to head to work.  The first time I stopped in I got a bottle of Perrier and the gentleman who rung up my purchase went as far to open up the bottle and give me a straw for it.  Its the little touches that make me smile =)For my next trip I got a cappuccino (a bit to wet but still good nonetheless), Orangina, and a couple of almond croissants.  It was a bit more expensive than some other places at around $15, but it was well worth it!
4	I am a big fan of this place. I happened to come on the most randomest day and had one of their cheesecakes and a chocolate crossiant. The owner was really sweet and his crossaints were delicious. Dont hesitate to come grab a sweet bite if ever you pass by this exit of the sherbrooke metro station :)
5	This shop/cafe is a hidden gem. The cakes and pastry is just superb and the cheese they have is very special. They have special Christmas/New Year 'menu' where you can order a specially prepared meal and fois gras they have is my favorite. Yes, it may be a bit pricier than other places, but the quality, selection and service is worth it.
4	Hey hey I've always passed by the bakery, but never tried it.Today, I give it a chance and...OMG Dat cute EDIBLE penguin made my day! They sell all kinds of dessert : chocolate, cakes, macarons, etc. The staff is really kind. It's a good place to stop by and get a little snacks.Yeye~
