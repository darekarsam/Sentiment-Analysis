1	I don't get the attraction to this place! The clothes are not that cute and they are outrageously overpriced. If they weren't having a 40% off sale, I would have turned around and left. Jeans for a 7 year old should not be $60!
4	Cute stuff but pretty pricey. Still, if youre like me, you only shop during sales. I was pleased to get a cute little necklace for my daughter regularly priced $16 for $7 and change. They have a lot of cute girls accessories, crafts, stuffed animals, games, & other goodies. 3.5 stars but I'm rounding it up to 4.
1	Worst customer service experience ever, manager and floor supervisors are not accountable for their actions. Pricing of merchandise is incorrect and the checkout procedures are terrible. There was one line and instead of co mingling the first couple of customers, the supervisors let the people from the back start up another line. This is why people shop online. This is why businesses close. Retail shops should strive for great customer service, to ensure their businesses' success. They just lost a customer.
