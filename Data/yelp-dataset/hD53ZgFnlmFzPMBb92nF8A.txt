5	If you are looking for home security this is the place to go.  They offer top notch technology with superior protection.  Ask for Nick or Justin and they will take great care of you.
5	Guardian is the alarm company I have at my new home. Justin Kissel from Guardian was very helpful with the process and educated my wife and I on what we should have in our home. We sleep better at night now that Guardian is looking out for us. Thanks guys!
1	If I could give them 0 stars I would. This company sent an installer out to my house who bold faced lied to my face telling me that he was putting a cancelation fee clause into the contract. Then rushed me through signing all the documents and did not discuss that if I wanted to cancel the agreement I had 3 days well here I am 4 days after the deadline wanting to cancel this agreement because your company has already waisted a full 8 hours of my pay waiting on an installer who didn't show up and extremely dissatisfied with your service. I don't want your alarm system I just want to cancel and your company is doing absolutely nothing to help me exit the contract whether it be a fee or a pay off of my months payment for the literal 4 days extra this alarm system has been in my house. So don't let these people strong arm you because they will and will do anything they can to screw you out of your money.
