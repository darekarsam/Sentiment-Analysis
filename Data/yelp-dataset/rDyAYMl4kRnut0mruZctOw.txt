4	This place is having an amazing sale.  You buy one frame & the second is a penny!  I go once a year and buy tons of frames - I love the silver one's and they have some pretty cool contemp styles as well.  I give framed pics out as gifts quite a bit - who needs another tie or a sweater?  Everyone loves a nice pic!And since I go there a lot I know they aren't marking up there prices!  They have a great selection & the people have always been very helpful & nice.  I have also run in there when I need an item to finish up a painting (there paint supplies are a bit pricey) but there frames are great! Don't go during the lunch hour as they share there lot with several popular restaurants!
4	Nice spot, good people, friendly service, and good prices.  Sure the price isn't going to top the deals you can get with coupons at Michael's, but the quality, service, and layout should make you feel okay about spending a few extra bucks.
5	Lots and lots of frames here. Great frames with lots of variety. Or you can also have them custom frame for you. This place is large and very professional. It doesn't feel at all mom and pop like lots of framing stores do. I definitely recommend this place for any framing you need to do.
5	I can't recommend this place enough - we had a world map measuring 4 feet by 6 feet; the staff at Aaron Brothers was great in helping us get a good looking frame for a great price (cheaper than several other places we checked), and with friendly service.
