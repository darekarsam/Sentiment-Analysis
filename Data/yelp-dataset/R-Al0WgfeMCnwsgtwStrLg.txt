Instead of being separated into those spa chairs we were seated on couches in a L-shape. We were ableTo chat while being pampered. Excellent choice of nail colors and the nail techs were efficient and skilled. We even got to sip on some red wine while they worked. Great experience!
1	After a visit last year that went badly (rude customer service), I decided to give them another try. My friend scheduled an appointment for 4 people and I was feeling sick the day before so I called to see if it could be cancelled in case I was still unable to go the next day. I was told their policy is 24 hours ahead of time to cancel. I said it was 23.5 hours ahead of time and apologized, but reiterated that I would really appreciate it. Nope, she tells me they will charge 100% of the price anyways. I tell them there are laws against that and she repeats it's their policy. Paying 67$+ tax for a mani-pedi I'm not even getting? Are they unable to book another appointment between now and then? Are they flying in a specialist?Never returning. No one I know is going ever again either.  Revise your customer service and stop taking yourself so seriously Rouge Nail Salon.
