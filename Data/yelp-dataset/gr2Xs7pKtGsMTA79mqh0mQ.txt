3	This is a definite kids place.  They have everything you might need to keep a little one entertained, whether it's your own or just visiting for the weekend.  They have all kinds of stuff from classics to more modern things.  I have to say, I had a good time playing with the pluch puppets and the fairy pop-up books.  Which, by the way would make a great gift for a adult fairy fan as well.  Is is just me or are kids fairy books getting more and more like works of art?Anyway, if there is a little one in your life this would be a great place to check out for birthdays and Christmas, or whenever.
4	If you've tired of the standard mall toy store fare, Bedford Falls may be for you.  They aren't exactly a learning store, where you'll find stuff that kids don't like - they actually have things that kids can enjoy as well, but they can enjoy in the process: Things like volcanos, build-your own slime kits and even potato guns.You can of course find Thomas toys, army men, stuffed animals, books and all manner of kids toys as well, and the staff is first-rate at helping you find what you might need.
5	Wow! A blast from the past! Walking into this store was like stepping back into my childhood. Lot's of cool retro toys. Lot's of toys you just can't find anywhere else. Up until now Lakeshore Learning has been my favorite educational/toy store....but I now have a new favorite. I was able to find several of the same products that they sell in Lakeshore Learning the difference being that Lakeshore Learning is somewhat over priced in my opinion! Bedford Falls is not cheap but it it seems to be more reasonable than Lakeshore Learning for sure.  I also thought that the educational toys at Bedford Falls were more interesting and appealing to kids....some of the coolest science toys I have ever seen! Once you go here you'll be hooked for sure.
