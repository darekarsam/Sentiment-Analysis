5	Every Great Clips I've ever used is often busy - but that's why they have online check-in available so I absolutely recommend using this feature on their website. I've been to this location 3 times since I moved to the area and I've had a different stylist each time. The quality is consistent and the ladies are always pleasant. They also have great recommendations for styling products. A++ in my book!
1	Your always taking a chance going to one of these low cost hair cutters. I thought since I was getting a basic trim of one inch, long layers and simple bangs it wouldn't be worth paying $50+. But I should have gone to a real salon. The trim was fine, she actually knew what one inch was! Some hair cutters get a little scissor happy. The layers were uneven, choppy, and very noticeable (I guess everyone can get their license nowadays).I asked for sidebangs that "swoop over to one side and blends in with the layers. I would also like to keep them from being too short (pointing below my cheek bone) because I like keeping my hair longer." She said ok I can do that. She literally cut my bangs and hair from the side of my head! She cut it straight across making it look like a giant square right at my cheek bone and like a start of a bowl cut on the side of my face. She handed me the mirror and said "what do you think?" I said "do you think you could blend the bangs in a little bit?" She said "oh... No... I can't do that. If I tried it would start to look like a mullet. But I can try to texture it." I said "this is not what I wanted." She got upset and she let it show. She became defensive. At least she didn't charge me the extra $6 for the cutting of the bangs as I wouldn't of paid for the cut anyways! Maybe she was confused to what I meant? I would have showed her a picture or she should have said I can't do that and I would of been fine with that too.
