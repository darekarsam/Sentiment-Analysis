3	Sign up for their mobile coupons! Great one day deals tend to pop up.Papa Murphy's is a decent neighborhood place. Build your pizza and then take it home to bake it.  It is hot and perfect.  They include great baking directions.  On this visit, I used the $5 any pan pizza coupon.  I got the cowboy pizza, a mix of meat and veggies.  Their new pizza is delicious.  Great, thick crust and generous toppings.  The cowboy pizza had pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms and more.  However, the cooking is kind of complex.  You have to remove the pan pizza from its pan in order to serve it.  That gets cumbersome.  The line is never too long and you can always call ahead.  I would recommend this for a quick week night dinner.
5	One of our family's favorite choices for pizza...staff has always been very friendly and helpful at this location even when we have to customize their specialty pizzas for the kids. Over the summer we have also tried their s'mores pizza and it was a big hit.  Our favorite right now is the  Herb Chicken Mediterranean....would definitely recommend giving it a try.
