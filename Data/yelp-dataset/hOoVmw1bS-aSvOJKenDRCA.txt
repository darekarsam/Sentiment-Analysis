2	This Del Taco is only about 5 minutes from where I live that's why we go here. The food is okay, in my opinion nothing special and more 'Americanized' Mexican food. Tables were dirty as well as the bathrooms. Staff was considerate surprisingly with the customers they deal with on a daily basis.
1	Just about the worst Del Taco I have been to ever.Unfortunately this Del Taco is directly across the street from my housing complex. Moving in, I thought, hurray -- when I want greasy tacos and the morose feeling that comes with eating fast food, I'll go here!I'm being facetious - kind of - but I have actually enjoyed Del Taco in the past. The tacos aren't terrible and are usually quite cheap. Quesadillas usually have lots of cheese and the spicy chicken burrito is one of my fave indulgences.BUT my husband and I came here on a week night and sat in the drive-thru FOREVER. On top of our horrendous wait we got sub-par food (even for fast food standards). My chicken burrito was half-filled and barely warm. I asked for a crunchy taco in place of what was a soft taco in a combo meal, and they gave me - nothing! Yes, nothing. They just didn't bother to give me the crunchy taco I asked for.Very bad experience here. Oh, but they do give a GOOD military discount.
