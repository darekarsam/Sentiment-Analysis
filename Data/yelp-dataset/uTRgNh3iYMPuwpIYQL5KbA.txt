5	Fast, friendly efficient. And they offer to pick you up or give you a ride.Keep in mind: since this is Las Vegas and we have a lot of tourists coming through, you have to pay a refundable $350 deposit for your rental. When you return it they will just deduct your charge from your deductible and give you the rest of your money back.This location serves Nellis Air Force Base so they have a lot of cool photographs and thank you cards from airmen displayed on the wall.
4	Pros: I love that they pick up & drop me off when needed. Most of the time they are fast and accommodating to my needs. I've been to this location over a 6 year span & I've recommended numerous people there as well. The staff is friendly & always greet you with a smile... Cons: They are constantly switching out their employees which at times makes it difficult to communicate what I need. At the moment they have one particular person that I don't care for who has been rude with me in the past and they said she wouldn't be back at that location but now she is. She is a crazy driver who talks & texts while driving not to mention speeds in the same process. Not very safe.
