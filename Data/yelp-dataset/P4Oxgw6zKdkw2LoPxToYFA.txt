5	What a great treat. And at 7:30am, no less.  I had never had the signature Smoothie King experience before, as I am accustomed to the wide world of Jamba, but was impressed at how many options there were, and how many of those options had such unique ingredients.  I had a drink called the Passion Passport, which was a blissful blend.  I cant even recall what it involved, but I remember thinking that I was impressed that it actually tasted like smooth silky fruit not blended ice with fruit infusion, as you so readily encounter at most smoothie bars.  I also appreciate that they categorized the drinks by the mix-ins or boosts or whatever, so that you have a pretty good idea if your drink is going to include protein powder or an additive to aid immunity. You don't have to read the whole list before deciding.  PLUS, they have a ton of other health supplements and snack alternative of the dry/handheld varieties.
3	Smoothie King delivers?! Minimum charge $15 - accepts AMEX too.But I wish smoothies weren't so expensive =(Drink of choice? Muscle punch (no turbinado) - tastes like a strawberry creamsicle.
4	Love me some fresh fruit smoothies especially before work and for breakfast!  I can't help being a fan of this place and the location in the epicenter is great.  Yup I'm a fan!
4	I love Smoothie King!  This is a great location right in the Epicentre on the 2nd level.  They all share the same menus and have generally the same items for sale.  Folks in here are super friendly and quick enough.  I always get the Angel Food smoothie - filling and has protein and other options if you want.  Delicious!
4	Great location & hours, for those of us in Uptown early, or even a mid-day snack. Service is good and the options are awesome! I love the Strawberry-Banana Smoothie! A definite alternative to some of the other morning, snack options.
