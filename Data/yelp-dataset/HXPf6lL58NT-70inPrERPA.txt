5	Pleasant, Professional, & Caring. Everything you want when you are looking forward to a service. Whether you want to pamper yourself, or have concerns with the condition of your skin, Teresa will complete a skin diagnosis before doing a consultation with you and talk about goals to give you the ageless, youthful, and clear skin you desire. I receive Microdermabrasion & Enzyme Peels which help purge out my impurities from makeup & refine & soften my skin's texture! I love it & recommend anyone seeking skincare services to call Ageless Skin Studios!
5	I have thoroughly enjoyed my facial treatments(so far chemical peel, Collagen facial and micro)with Teresa.  She is very knowledgeable when doing her skin analysis and knew exactly what to do to take care of my concerns.  Her microdermabrasion machine is like no other.  Love the Vitamin and Mineral oxygen infusion that is part of her micro treatment.  I have seen amazing results with my series that I have started.  Look forward to going to my appointments. I would refer Ageless Skin Studio to anyone wanting personalized facial treatments either for comfort or concerns.  This studio is located in Salon Boutique which is next to Total Wine & More
5	I have been going to the studio for almost a year now.  The services available have greatly improved my skin's healthiness and appearance.  I have done chemical peels, microderm abrasion and most recently they have added the LED anti aging service which I think has greatly improved my lines and wrinkles.I would recommend this skin care studio to all my family and friends.I want to mention that I was looking at the Yelp reviews for the studio that are filtered, and they too, are good reviews.  So check them out.
