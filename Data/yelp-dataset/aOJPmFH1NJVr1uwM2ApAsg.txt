5	I love getting my hair done here. Super cheap and the students really try to give you a great look. It's $16 for a cut wash and style or $13 for a wash and style, so sometimes I come here just when I'm too lazy to straighten my hair!But, as great as this place is, make sure you leave plenty of time for your appointment because it takes students a lot longer than at a regular salon.Oh, and they give free hand massages!
4	I have to admit, I didn't realize this was a beauty school until entering. The student cutting my hair asked a lot of questions and was open to direction as they don't have too much experience with my super curly black hair. My cut was great and well priced. Plan to spend a little more time on the cut as these are students.
