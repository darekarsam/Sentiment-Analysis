3	I love J. Crew clothes! This location has terrible customer service (all except the one time I walked in w/ my boyfriend's mother) but a decent sale section. The one at Ross Park Mall is better, but this location is within walking distance of my apartment so I drop by often.
3	Not the biggest fan of this J Crew... The store not only feels tight from the volume of clothes inside but also is generally cramped with people. I have never been asked if I needed assistance and generally just slip in and out of the store unnoticed. I would prefer to shop at one of the other J Crew locations in the city.
4	I absolutely love JCrew! I have not been to many locations before so I can't really compare this certain location to others. However, the fact that it is located on Walnut street makes it a pretty desirable store to go to. It only has a women's department though so that may be it's one downfall. The staff are very attentive every time I have been here and they make the checkout process pretty quick and easy.
