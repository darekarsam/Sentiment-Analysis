5	Beautiful, original & tasteful!!! Staff was nice as usual and delicious meal as usual. The lounge music and the decor are very trendy & relaxing
4	Been there for a team lunch, the place was packed, a bit on a louder side - but cozy.Nice menu - would've been considered "exquisite" elsewhere in Canada, though rather common for Quebec area. I like places like that, where you won't get bored by the same plates in a while.Quality of food was very satisfactory, though portion size was good for those who dream losing weight. Personally I'd prefer heftier chunks of food, but that's just me.Price wise, Zibo was neither cheap, nor a wallet killer - especially for an "Italian" place. I wouldn't hesitate visiting it again next time in Laval.
4	A classic as far as I am concerned. Their menu as changed a lot since they have opened and I never have been disappointed. Am definitely a fan :)
4	I've been here before but its been a while.  I always remember the pretty girls that worked here and it seems the tradition still continues. I ordered a California chicken sandwich, which was in fact very good. Fresh chicken breast slices with guacamole, cheese etc... I truly enjoyed it. I would go back for the food next time and not the girls. lol...
