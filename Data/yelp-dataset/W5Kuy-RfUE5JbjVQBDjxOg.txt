5	My baby son had a back and hip injury and after just two visits, he was like new. Dr. Brian was willing to juggle around his schedule to fit us in on short notice. The office is spacious and comfortable, and they even have some toys in the waiting room. Both Dr. Brian and his partner Dr. Ingrid are warm and attentive. I highly recommend the practice.
5	I am one of those people who used to think that Chiropractic work wasn't helpful.  I have to tell you that I have done a 180 on my thinking.  Dr. Wussow is amazing, and I would recommend him to anyone (and I do).  As a person concerned with my overall health & well being, Dr. Brian treated me like I wasn't just a bunch of symptoms he could fix or adjust, but rather as a person who wanted to live a long vital life.  While working together, he gives me great adjustments, as well as helpful guidance on how to live a healthier life.  I would give 6 stars.
5	Dr. Brian Wussow is extremely knowledgeable and professional, and yet very kind and friendly. I highly recommend his practice to anyone needing chiropractic help.
