5	Celebrity Tux and Tails did a great job for me, my groomsmen and my two boys! The suits looked great!! I especially liked the level of customer service from Larry. He took good care of me and all my guys. He obviously knows his stuff about formal attire and very helpful through the entire process. I would gladly recommend Celebrity Tux and Tails.Thanks a lot!
5	Celebrity Tux and Tails was great to work with.  I purchased a suit jacket and was thrilled with the result.  It was altered to fit me and the work was perfect. The best part was Larry came to me!  His prices are very competitive, and every one of my questions were answered.  Thank you Larry!
5	Larry was the best! We recently had our wedding this past weekend and everything went perfect. We had a general idea of the colors we wanted for our wedding but Larry made a few suggestions that really made or tuxes stand out. His service was excellent, he comes to you for everything, this was very beneficial as my dad and groomsmen were from out of town. Larry will come to your house for a fitting, drop the tuxes off and pick them up! Also they were much more affordable then the larger stores. We had a few add ons and I think our total was $165.00 per tux. For the ease of dealing with Larry, it was definitely worth it.
