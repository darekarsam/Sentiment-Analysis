4	I only have positive comments to give Labarake.I was a bit worried after reading the other reviews but I liked it very much.I had the Fish & chips which includedA small black beer.  The Fish & chips portion was very big.Good quality/ priceWe had the chance to sit on the terrasse.  Very nice and excellent service. My friends had the Tuna club and the Beef Tartare and both were very satisfied.
4	I loved the decor and the ambiance. The service was excellent. I loved the food we started off with a roquette salad with caramelized pecans. Then, for the main course I had a braised beef cheek and it was so delicious the accompaniment went wonderful,y with beef.The only hic is the opening hours that are tricky, it's open in the day and then closes until the night service. It took me a long time to try that place cause of the hours that never fitted with when I wanted to go.All and all delicious food, excellent decor and great service.
