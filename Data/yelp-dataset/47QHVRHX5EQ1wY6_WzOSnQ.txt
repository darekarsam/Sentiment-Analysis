5	Dr. Nelson is a wonderful woman and doctor!  She was the first out of 4 drs who I felt truly comfortable with the care of my 5 yr old child.  She did an amazing job on his surgery and if you're looking for a dr who shows respect and true ability to make your entire process as easy as possible, she's the one to go to!  She went to the extent of giving us her home phone number in case we needed to reach her post surgery for any questions or concerns.  Truly gifted!
5	We had been to many pediatric eye doctors for my doctor who had a cornea transplant. We happen to see Dr. Nelson initially by accident when my daughter was in the hospital. I cannot come up with enough words to express my graditude for Dr. Nelson and how she has attempted to help my daughter see.  It is annoying to wait so long for her in the waiting room, but I would wait half a day for my daughter to see Dr. Nelson because I trust her with my daughter's eyes.
1	The people that work the front desk are the rudest people I have ever met. 745am appointment didn't get in to 930am see the Dr. For 5 min and wait 30 more min back in the waiting room.  Done this routine for the past 2 years. I am over it going to find a different Dr. the plus side of it is that the dr is very nice. She should fire the front desk staff and start fresh. Do not recommend this office unless you like wasting your whole day at the Doctor office. It's kinda like you are at the DMV
1	While Dr. Nelson is great the office staff needs to be replaced! Been going here for awhile & the wait is beyond ridiculous!!! This time I made sure to make first appointment after lunch figuring no problem. We'd be in and out. WRONG!! Our appointment was at 12:20 and didn't get called back till 12:45. WHY!? Their lunch order was late arriving so I guess we needed to wait for them to eat!!!! Very unprofessional!! Do they think that only their time matters!!! At this rate they will wonder why they keep losing patients! As of right now we are in wait status again. Shocker....eyes rolling!! Plus no apologies for being late!!! EXCUSE ME MY TIME IS JUST AS VALUABLE AS YOURS!!! Update. The nurse tells me they will be right in as soon as they get here....only problem idiot...I just saw all the doctors sitting in an office EATING THEIR LATE LUNCH DELIVERY!! Yes I know it's late because you all stood at the front desk to hear you not only complain about it but heard you make the phone call to inquire where is your food because you ordered earlier than normal!! EXCUSE ME WHERE IS THE DECENCY OF NOT MAKING YOUR PATIENTS WAIT AS I MADE THIS APPOINTMENT IN HOPES THAT JUST ONCE I WOULD BE SAFE FROM YOUR OBNOXIOUS WAIT TIMES!!! Still rolling my eyes as it's now been 15 minutes since the nurse says they will be in to see us in a few minutes!!! LAST STRAW!!!! Oh & this is at the Goldring office & I've been to Henderson with same thing. So it doesn't matter what office. OH & STILL WAITING FOR THE DOCTOR.....ITS BEEN AN HOUR SINCE MY SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT WHICH WAS THE FIRST ONE AFTER LUCH....EVERYTHING IS SO WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE!!!!!!
