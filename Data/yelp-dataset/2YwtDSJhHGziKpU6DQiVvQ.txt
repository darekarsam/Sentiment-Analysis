5	This shop is a blast from the past with an adorable 50's theme! The variety of options is very wide, with dozens of different soda flavors, shakes, ice cream, and more! There's also a nice variety of sandwiches and baked goods, plus vintage clothing! There's something for everyone at Berties!
5	Great sandwiches!! Great service!!! Great sundaes!! Reminded me of when I grew up as a kiddoes and my kiddoes were welcomed with open arms!! Which if I could give 10 stars I would!!
5	50's - 60's diner style with lots of period memorabilia & knickknacks (some for sale!). Great food & nice ambiance, but very slow service. Don't be in a rush & you'll enjoy it!
