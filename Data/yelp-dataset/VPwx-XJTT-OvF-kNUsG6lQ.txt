5	repurpose, recycle, reuse...stopped in over the long weekend and love the store...hope they do well in town square...
5	This is the coolest, most unique, and interesting store I have ever been in.  This is my third time here.   Each time I see something that I didn't see the last time.  Molly the owner is super sweet.  I will definitely come back when I get back into town.
5	Fantastic Gem of a store w/unusual items that you will not find anywhere else. Wonderful people run this place, I bought a hat, and it was a steal, check out their discounted stuff.Something for everyone, unusual gifts, hand crafted product and repurposed.So neat!
5	A unique and refreshing experience! Molly was delightful, answering all my questions about the unique pieces in her shop. So nice to have a boutique experience that is so outside the box. Thank you Molly!
5	Such a fun store! I found a million things I wanted.I love that even though there are breakables, they are kid friendly, having the chalkboard table and magnet wall. My daughter was able to draw while I browsed. I found a great Nevada state print for my husbands office and so many ideas for Christmas gifts. They offer classes using the cece Caldwell chalk paints as well, if you are interested in learning to paint and distress furniture.
5	I saw a post on IG of floral head pieces. I went in to get one for my Halloween costume and loved the whole store!
