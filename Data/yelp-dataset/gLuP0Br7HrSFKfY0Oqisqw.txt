5	I enjoy the staff here. I love Kali! Everyone is very nice and extremely helpful. My schedule is crazy but they are always willing to work around my schedule to make sure I can get in for an appointment.
5	Dr Homewood is a great Doc. I went to him for the first time back in May and I had no idea what was wrong with me. He was able to give me a diagnosis and has been helping me manage it since then. He takes his time with you and answers any questions you may have. The staff is very friendly and they are always willing to accommodate you. My first time calling them, I complained of pain and said I had been dealing with it for a few weeks and they were able to get me in that very same day!  I am glad that I decided to call and get in with this practice. I will be transferring my kids over to this practice as well. If you are in Mesa and are looking for a good primary Doctor, I highly recommend Dr. Homewood and all of his staff
5	Absolutely love the Nurse Practioner Kionglee Jung. She was very helpful to my needs. I was able to ask questions and get the answers i needed. If your looking for a new doctor come here you wont be disappointed.
5	I love this place! The staff is very welcoming and friendly! I had the pleasure of meeting both providers. Dr Homewood was wonderful! I also met with the Nurse Practitioner Kionglee Jung she was awesome! They both addressed my every need! I highly recommend this doctors office to anyone!
