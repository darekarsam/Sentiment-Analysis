5	This is a great family owned shop that took care of my Jeep and it is back 100% after my fender bender. They will  answer any questions that you have!!! They also lined up a rental car for me. They definitely go over and above!
5	I took my 2008 Honda Civic in to have the front bumper repaired.  My son rolled over a parking block and then backed up.  He pulled the frontend off my car.  I called Queen Creek Auto Body on a Holiday weekend to set up an appointment.  They called me back the next day and got me right in.  They answered all my questions and gave me an awesome quote!  They fixed my car in 3 hours and got me back on the road. I would refer anyone to Queen Creek Auto Body.  They are a Local Family Owned Business that takes care of their customers.
1	We had a friend drop our car off here May 1, 2014 to get both doors painted and fixed.  We were out of town,  which is why a friend dropped it off, at that time he told them EXACTLY what we wanted done.  It is now Oct 9th and we still have no car.  They have given us excuse after excuse after excuse, month after month acting totally clueless when we call.  It has been close to half a year. That is half a year with only one car for my family. They have used the excuse that they thought we were out of town (so what?!), that they didn't have our contact info (they had both phone and email which my husband verified), that there was mis-communication with new employees. We told them numerous times to "go ahead and get it done". We told them once again in person on 9/24 to do the work! But I guess that didnt suffice as a yes or no to do the work. Then they blamed us. If you see my other yelp reviews, I'm not a big complainer, and I praise as I see fit, which is actually quite often. But Queen Creek Auto Body is a shoddy business with horrible customer service. Save yourself time and take your car elsewhere.
