2	Don't get me wrong, I like port of subs, just not this one. Stay away.
4	I love port of subs and this one is very clean, professional and the sub was excellent.  I recommend this location to any one in the area.  Clean, bright and well lit with a very clean bathroom.
2	Yikes! I had high hopes for this place, and I was disappointed.  The customer service was awesome, which is what the 2 stars are for.  The food was not good.  Less quality then Subway.  I got a vegetarian sub on wheat.  The bread is horrible.  no strong and thin almost.  The veggies were ok.  My mayo was kinda warm? blahhhh! Not very good at all, I will not go back.
5	I had made a complaint and management contacted me immediately. This speaks volumes on the companies behalf. They made it right and I couldn't have asked for more. If you have any concerns or complaints this company will take care of you. Give them a shot, it's worth it.
