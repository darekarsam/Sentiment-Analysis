5	One of my favorite bike shops in MTL. Friendly staff, quick service dept, and have a supportive staff. They have a race team and do trips, as well. Awesome location being on the bike path into the park.
1	AVOID. I went in there to get a flat changed because I was too busy with work at the time to do it myself. First, these people did not even do the repair properly - they returned the bike to me with the wheel installed so poorly that the bike would not even pedal. Second, they knocked my bike around so badly that they broke a bunch of the gear teeth, causing the chain to click loudly with every pedal. Third, when I complained, they tried to tell me (I kid you not) that that the gear teeth had broken because my brake wires were old, and tried to get me to PAY THEM to change the brake wires. Now, as a woman, I am frequently fed BS by male mechanics who assume that I don't know anything about bikes. But this was the most ridiculous line that has ever been tried on me in my life.Shady business tactics and con artistry aside, the astoundingly poor quality of work alone merits avoiding this place. I brought my bike in with a flat and they gave it back to me in worse condition than before - with a jammed wheel and broken gear teeth. That says it all.
