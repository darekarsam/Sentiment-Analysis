5	A classic, relaxing, therapeutic massage.  I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with Melinda and will definitely be back.
5	I've had many prenatal massages and I must say Melinda tops them all. So relaxing and refreshing. She made me feel so comfortable and relaxed. Every time I leave, I feel 20 lbs lighter and much more relaxed... at 34 weeks pregnant, I plan on fitting at least 2 more massages in before this baby comes.
5	Thank you for the massage today Melinda!   Amazing job - professional, gentle, and thorough - so relaxed and it really helped with hip pain.  WONDERFUL!!!
