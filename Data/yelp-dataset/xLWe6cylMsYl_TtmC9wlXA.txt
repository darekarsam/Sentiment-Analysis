3	Yes I love Burger King. Yes I know its terrible for me. No I will not stop coming here. I love this location, even though someone was shot in the face here not too long ago, I still can not stay away. I love the fact that I can go through the drive-thru and not have to worry about checking my bag for the right items because they have never messed up one order of mine. And that is pretty damn rare for fast food.Other than that typical BK fare.
3	I've been here several times.I have no big complaints against this store, as they've always gotten my order correct.
2	I've been here quite a few times. (Honestly because it's very near my house) on 2 or 3 occasions,  they've left something out of my order or had me drive up and wait. They're usually pretty slow.in the drive thru. Lesson:: triple check the order while still at the window and don't go here in a hurry. (More than 1 car can't be dealt with at a time)
