5	Wonderful house specials, including scrambled eggs (breakfast), potstickers, curry, ribeye steak, and green tea.
5	If you want excellent Chinese food you have to go to J. Y. Chang's. There are no other viable options in the area.
5	I heard about it yesterday, when some friends asked for ribeyes to eat while enjoying the Super Bowl and, later, they told me about the high quality and service, so I decided to give it a try today. My opinion? Probably the best scrambled eggs and rib eyes I have tried in years and, certainly, the best you can find in the region. Five stars.
