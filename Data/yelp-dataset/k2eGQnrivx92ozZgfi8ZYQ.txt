5	Wow, can't believe no one has reviewed this  "Small, High end, well managed, well staffed, get the best bike" shop in town.  This place is not your "Discount" type Bike shop - these guys are Pros'.  They know what they are doing, they know how to fit you for a bike, and they know the business.  They Ride, they Tri, they know their stuff.  From Tri bikes, to Mtn. bikes, to cruiser bike, to accessories - If you are serious or even casual about riding or just want to get the best service - this is the place.   If you are looking for a cheap bike and no care service, then don't go here -There are plenty of other factory type shops that can help you get the wrong deal. Really - they will help you find what you are looking for - again, great service.
2	Oh I am SO disappointed! Over the last week in June I scoped out four area bike shops in search of my very first bicycle. During that time I went to Bicycle Haus where I spoke with Shasta, the owner about what I was looking for in a bike and what my budget was. She was great and immediately pointed me in the direction of the Specialized Carmel I, giving me loads of reasons it would be the perfect bike for me. When I saw the price tag I relayed my budget concerns and she said "You know, we can make it work for you," and then helpfully talked me through all the accessories that I would need to have a safe, pleasant ride. I told her my time frame to buy was about three weeks later, thanked her very much and went on my way. After visiting the other 3 shops I still liked my experience with BH the best and was also pleased with it's proximity to my house which would make getting there for tune ups and future supply needs extremely easy. Fast forward selector: I walk in on a Tuesday, just to talk to someone about renting the bike before I bought it, and was pointed to John (Shasta wasn't there) and we talked briefly about the model, purchasing and renting. I was a little put off by him because even though there were three other guys working there, he would leave me to go answer the phone and ring up other customers. Come on dude, let's focus on customer service here. I decided to go back a few days later to speak with Shasta again directly. When I went in two days later, Shasta was there but didn't remember me, nor attended to me. I found John who also had a hard time remembering who I was FROM TWO DAYS AGO and we went over all the things I would need again and I told him flat out that Shasta had told me we could make my budget work with this specific bike. He stood there looking at me blankly, pointed to the price tag and said, "well I don't know what she told you but the price is $450." Then I asked him if he would put together an invoice so I could see exactly how much all of this was going to cost me.  More blank staring, then he told me he didn't know how so he left me at the counter just waiting for someone else to help me. Shasta attended to a few other people who were milling around and then said she could do the proposal for me. Still no recognition. After we went through everything the price was almost $200 more than I could spend! I walked out extremely frustrated. I'm sure you could explain away not remembering me, but I work in a similar small, specialized industry and even if I don't remember names I always remember faces and frankly in this economy I don't believe that Bicycle Haus has a ton of people coming in looking to purchase their first bike right now. I find both John and Shasta's behavior very off-putting and very disappointing. I am all for supporting small businesses and ESPECIALLY women-owned businesses but there's no way I would ever recommend Bicycle Haus to a novice rider/shopper based on my very Jekyl and Hyde experiences.
5	This shop carries bikes at all price points but caters to the high end cycling market.Very friendly staff, nice to see a business give back so much to the cycling community. Ask about the vintage track bikes on display in the fit studio!
5	Bicycle Haus is the best shop in the Valley, if not State. It's as simple as that. There isn't another shop that carries the selection (and if you don't see what you are looking for, ask), has the friendly, and actually knowledgeable staff, and reputation that Haus does. This place has a selection like I've never seen before, especially if you are looking for high end product. The inventory and shop is always rotating and fresh, so I like to stop in and see what's new almost weekly, plus the staff is really friendly, and always willing to talk bikes. They have a great selection of apparel, accessories, and nutrition, in brands that you can't find anywhere else around. If you have never been fit on a bike before, this is the place to do it. It is literally a computer science, the two hour long (give or take) session, will customize your machine to you! Taking into account your body, flexibility, physical limitation, goals, and what type of riding you are doing to put you into the most comfortable, efficient, and effective position possible! The shop also does a lot to support the cycling community both in Charity and time and effort. Bottom line, if you are looking for good quality and service, this is the place.
5	Dialed-in.  That's the best way to describe Bicycle Haus in terms of inventory and service.  Always on the bleeding edge of the industry, but not so far away that us "normal" cyclists are left behind.  I know they offer the best of the best in terms of bikes, components, gear, etc, but some of us just aren't looking for that.  They've helped me with a ton of very basic upkeep items and a couple low end bikes (one 26" dirt jump mountain bike and a little kid's push-bike).  I even took my VERY simple single speed road bike in for a custom fit, which was worth EVERY penny.The crew there has always been more than helpful with hosting community cycling events by helping promote and donating items to be giving away as prizes/awards.No matter what level or dicipline of bike or biking you're into, Bike Haus will have you covered.
1	A few months ago, I had a pleasant meeting with the sales manager at a local Einstein's. Being that I had just moved from San Diego, and had started riding again, I was looking for a new bike shop. Surely there are none as GREAT as Adam's Ave. in San Diego, and so far, I continue to believe this.I went in to investigate the store, and upon cursory glance noticed a $30 Specialized bike pump being sold for $70. Hmmmm. Interesting. I went out for a ride last week, and, in my youthful exuberance, forgot my water bottles. I know! WHO DOES THAT!? Along the route was Bicycle Haus. I had a few meager dollars in my kit, and was in need. Surely they would help a fellow cyclist out. I entered, and I did so, feeling like I was getting stabbed by eyeballs. A better term: eye fucked. "Who is this enemy intruder, sporting different colors, and wearing a foreign kit?" "Details.", I thought as I stated my case for two water bottles. After being sized up, the guy behind the counter pointed nonchalantly, and said, "Over there." After grabbing two bottles, I reached into my kit, and told him I was unsure if I had the $12 and change he requested. I asked if I could bring in the $1.50 or so I may have been short, upon completion of my ride. He says, "I'm sorry, you're going to need to leave one of the bottles behind if you can't pay for both." OVER A DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENTS?! Turns out, I had $13 in cold hard American currency to pay the man. But it left a really bad taste in my mouth. I live on the road that the BH crowd frequents on their way to get their LGO caffeine fix. I find them to be a generally unfriendly, pompous, and arrogant  lot. No wave, no smile and nod, no common cycling courtesies. When seen at LGO, they do the same.I was passing this story along to a guy that I ride with, and he said that they do group rides on Monday and Wednesdays. My days might be off, so forgive me. His personal experiences ring like mine, however he passed one on that left me convinced of the depth of douchebaggery owned by these guys. Picture if you will: Group ride winding down. They get to their destination, and one rider develops a slow leak, which by the conclusion of post-ride hanging out has gone flat. He goes to his trusty steed, and finds a hoof gone wrong. Upon asking fellow riders for assistance (tube and Co2), they shrug shoulders and leave. Trusty steed and rider hobbled, he is forced to walk home 1.5 miles, with hobbled steed in tow. Inappropriate. Grossly, and wildly inappropriate. Get it together, guys. Most definitely NOT what the owner had in mind for his store. ***UPDATE***: While at breakfast this morning, I had the honor of being enlightened with a story from a friend about the Bicycle Haus. We were talking about my posting, and she said that she had been asked TO NOT COME BACK to BH because she "does not buy enough stuff" at BH. She is a mountain biker, and was coming in regularly to get service done on her mountain bike. Along with her service stop, she would pick up some post ride bars, and whatnots, and drop her bike, and go. Seems as though they did not take kindly to her "quickies" and asked her to stop coming in, all together. And now one of the service guys calls to ask her come to come back in?? Seriously?  And so, I was left thinking to myself, "That figures." when I heard of these shenanigans. They can have em, cuz we don't want em! But, hey, if the "coolest, sexiest, hippest" poser shit, some nose high attitude self-absorbed, pompous people, and bad service are what you're after, than it sounds like this is YOUR place! BUT... If you're an established, legitimate cyclist, and you look for inconsequential things like good service, competent wrenches, good vibes, good peeps, a smile, an appreciative owner who is thankful for your patronage, and and fun group of people who frequent the shop than you just might want to search elsewhere. I would suggest Adam's Avenue, but maybe I'm the only one willing to pack all of my bikes and drive them to San Diego.***Update #2*** I have never received "hate mail" for a post, until I did from a dude named Robert who said that I was a "douchebag, wanna-be asshole" for writing the review I wrote on BH.Who would think I could irk someone SO MUCH just by expressing my opinion? Love you, Robert. ;)It would be of no loss if this place did not survive the economy.And so, now it just complicated because:Of course, this is just OUR opinion, WE could be wrong.
1	Just popped into Bicycle Haus this past week looking for new components for my ride. I was looking at a custom order  (~$1500 worth). Guy behind the counter was busily typing away and thanked me and said he'd call me. I walked around the corner and glanced over my shoulder. Turns out the guy was on Facebook the whole time....very disappointing.
5	This is my very first time on Yelp, and I have to say, sweet idea!    As I sat to think of my first review, I couldn't help but share some of my many wonderful experiences with the good people at the Bicycle Haus.  I enjoy riding my bicycles in many different ways - to work, around the hood, on the dirt, on the road, or to the pubs/restaurants - and I feel that all my time riding has given me a very good perspective as to what makes a good, solid bike shop - something that is very, very important to me.  A good shop does more for me than just have stuff to buy or help fix my flats - a good bike shop is filled with people who have pretty much dedicated their lives to helping improve the lives of others with the bicycle.  That's requirement number one - a friendly, professional, passionate, knowledgeable staff.  I've been in a LOT of bike shops here in the valley as well as all across the country, and the folks that work in the Bicycle Haus are by far the MOST passionate, friendly, and professional people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting in a bike shop!  They have consistently treated me as if it were my very first time in the shop - greeting me with a smile and immediately dropping everything to meet my needs.  I almost look to swing by the shop for a pick-me-up whenever I'm feeling a little blue - that's how wonderful they actually are!  Plus, I know they serve a delicious espresso - I had one, once!  How cool is that?!?The other aspect about the Bicycle Haus that excels above all others is their obsessive attention to DETAIL!  I've always considered myself a bit of a perfectionist, but compared to the work that they've performed on my bikes, I'm a sloppy-joe!  They rise above and beyond my expectations every single time!  My bikes are in such fantastic shape thanks to the staff behind the counter.  The shop is always VERY clean, fresh, and very progressive in its layout.  I immediately feel comfortable and at home when I walk in and start my shopping - I have never had any trouble finding stuff that I need, and of course, when I can't find it, one of the Haus crew is right there to answer my call - with their seasoned advice.  I've saved a lot of dough thanks to their helpful suggestions.  The next element of the BIcycle Haus that you should be aware of is the QUALITY of their products - they have the absolute best gear.  I've noticed that a lot of their stuff is high end, but when I once went to find my nephew a bike - a little kid's bike - they had exactly what I needed and even gave me a fantastic price!  The quality of every piece in that shop - from their apparel and accessories to their bikes and nutrition - is very, very good stuff.  I also want good customer service in my dream shop, but at the same time, I need to be inspired!  Bicycles are beautiful - I may not be able to afford some of those bikes, but that's ok - I still want to hold them in my hands!  For the record, I found my very first road bike there as well as my most recent bike, which still wasn't too crazy expensive - the Haus folk found the perfect bike for me that fit my budget and still inspires me to this day!  So, 5 HUGE Stars goes to the good people working at the best shop around called the Bicycle Haus!  If you're looking for a shop to call home or buy your next tube, bike, helmet or whatever, find the Bicycle Haus first!  I guarantee that it will become your favorite shop within the first few smiles that greet you as you walk in - the Haus will become a HOME as it has for me.  Oh, I'm on facebook all the time, and if you are too, you should "friend" the Bicycle Haus - their posts are great - informative and inspiring.  Plus, they lead rides nearly everyday from the shop - I've enjoy a couple rides and hope to do more.  Imagine being served by friendly bicycle people - now imagine going on a ride with those friendly bicycle people - yup, that's the Bicycle Haus.Thank you, Haus!  Myself and my bikes are in good hands and shape, thanks to you!Ps. I've read the criticisms posted here, and I have to emphatically disagree.  Some folks seem to just post for the sake of satisfying some sort of chip or bitter itch.  Too bad.
5	If you are looking for a shop with exceptional attention to detail... look no further. I've been riding and racing with these guys for over 15 years and they are as knowledgeable  a group of cycling enthusiasts that you will find. I highly recommend their store.
1	I think they're going out of business!  Stopped by twice this week, middle of the day - closed up tight,  no lights, no bikes outside, no explanation.
5	This was a great experience, and it's funny how it happened. A friend of mine bought some things there like a seat bag with a repair kit, multi tool, etc. and then returned it the next day after deciding not to purchase a road bike as he had intended to. He reported some attitude from them, and then later that week I'd heard some other stories. So, I wanted to go in and look at their bikes as I was in the market for a new road cycle, and judge for myself what the service was like. I found Mark to be very helpful on my first visit even after telling him I wasn't purchasing a bike any time soon.When I did decide I wanted to buy a bike, I went in and rode just about every Ultegra bike in the shop. Before and after each test ride, they cleaned off the whole bike, put my pedals on, provided feedback and dialed in the seat and everything for me. Other shops, even "high end" shops, will just guesstimate the setup of the bike, and often are reluctant to put on your own pedals and instead just want to use test ride platforms. I left a deposit on the BMC I chose, that was equal to about 7% just because it was all I had at the time. They were cool with that, and then excercised patience while I was rounding up the money to pay it off. When I finally came in to pick up the bike, they had everything set up for me and even fitted the bike for me and gave me some free swag. The biggest thing is the owner, Kale, said "thank you for giving us your business." I know it seems trivial, but most places will just say thanks, and it is kind of empty. He made it seem sincere, like I was really important, and they really appreciated me spending my hard earned cash there. I also exchanged a couple of emails and asked a couple of questions to Brock and Russ, who both were prompt, informative, and friendly. If you have a question about your body mechanics on a bike or how it should be set up, Craig is a guru. He even forgot he took out my insole and forgot to put it back in, and then called me and acted as though he was ready to bring it to me. I must say, the stories I heard about the poor service are bunk. My friends must all be doing the same drug, or they get nervous when they walk into a shop with this much worth of inventory.This shop is clean as a whistle, well stocked, organized, and the staff is extremely knowlegable and friendly. I wouldn't feel comfortable bringing a Huffy in here for service, but for anyone who is a semi-serious to a racing cyclist, this is a dream shop.
5	I must say that I am extremely happy that I ignored the 1-2 stars reviews of Bicycle Haus here on Yelp when I was shopping around to pick up a new ride.   My experiences with the store were nothing short of being top rate.   It clearly makes me question the integrity of the individuals that wrote those previous reviews.  Russ, Shawn and Broc were not only extremely knowledgeable and helpful, but they went out of their way to make my experience with their store that much better.  On my first stop into Bicycle Haus late on a Sunday afternoon, Broc and Shawn both spend an exorbitant amount of time with me walking through their bikes and prices discussing all of their pros and cons and helping me dial into a few bikes to come back in to test ride based on my preferences and past experiences.  They are a top of the line bike shop, but they were not pretentious in talking down about other brands not carried in their store like other have discussed.   Even though the bike store was closing, they stayed open and continued to help me out.I came back on the next Friday, and Russ was extraordinarily helpful test riding each of the bikes.   Russ set up the bikes with my own pedals and provided me initial fits to each of them.   They best part was when the store told me to take each of the bikes out for a 5-6 mile ride to get a feel of how they rode on aggressive climbs, windy descents and nice flats.  Most shops would not have allowed me to take bikes of this level out of the parking lot let alone on a 5-6 mile loop.  Russ even made sure the bikes were tuned up properly to make the experiences were what they were meant to be like.  At this point I explored about 8-10 different LBS in between the Phoenix Metro area and Tucson/Oro Valley.I ended picking up one of their 2011 Specialized Tarmac Pros SL3 with a modified Dura Ace configuration that Friday.  Even though I was convinced this was the bike I wanted, Russ and Shawn offered me to take one of the Ultegra Tarmac Elite builds home for a couple days to test ride it and convince myself even more.  I thanked them for the offer, but I still ended picking up my bike that day instead.  Russ continued to completely set up the bike to my desired configuration that same afternoon without any extra charges.   I would normally expect that, but it was a nice touch when he went out of the way to rebuild my pedals for me for free even though I bought a different set to put on the Tarmac.Thank you for a great experience guys!  You definitely know how to win over a client by giving them good ole' fashioned great customer service like it is suppose to be done.  Most of my LBS experiences were only a fraction of what you guys provided.  I cannot wait until I get the complete fit done.  Cheers!!
2	Funny, the first time that I attain a "Dukedom", it's to a place that I'm not really pleased with. I attained this status by having to take my bike back several times for the same BASIC repair. I took my bike in for a tune up primarily because it was not shifting appropriately. When I dropped it off the entire staff was very busy watching the Tour De France. They said they might be able to get it to it that day. Two days later I had to call them asking them if my bike was done. "Oh yeah we finished it at 4:30 last night." Apparently they finished it closer to closing time than that because who ever "fixed it" didn't bother taking it for a test ride. Unfortunately I discovered this on a 15 mile desert ride. it was a rough ride.The next day when I took it back, I believe it was the manager manning the shop. He was busy with a customer when i came in. I have no problem with only 1 person manning the shop on a weekday afternoon, I don't have a problem with the fact that he was busy, but I do have an issue when someone doesn't even bother to acknowledge you. Customer service rule #1 acknowledge your customer. Just say hello and tell me that you will be with me as soon as you can. I waited for about 15 minutes before someone else came into the shop and helped me. Apparently the person that took the bike from me didn't pass on the fact that this was a return issue. When I went to pick up the bike again they tried to charge me for the repairs. Guess what.........IT"S STILL NOT FIXED.
5	Not being a "bike" person, the thought of venturing into a bicycle specialty shop is a little intimidating to me...however, they couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful, which totally put me at ease. They have a very informed crew working there, everyone was busy working on bikes or talking with clients, but they didn't hesitate to take the time to answer questions and educate me a bit about the products I was looking to purchase. My son purchased a "Fixie" and not only is it slick, its a piece of art really (and this coming from someone who doesn't really dig bikes!), but the price was more than fair. Not sure whats going on with some of the haters reviews on here, my experience was delightful and I would definitely recommend Bicycle Haus to novices who are looking to buy a fabulous product but need a little guidance.
5	For years I've been wanting a road bike and being the Internet nerd I spent most of my time online doing research.  As with car shopping decided to then hit some local bike shops to test some out and get some help.  Unfortunately I did not find a shop that worked out for me until my close friend introduced me to Bicycle Haus in downtown Scottsdale.  These guys are the real deal and Brock took great care of me.  Got me set up with an awesome Specialized Tarmac bike and all the essential gear and tips to get me on the road. I had a zillion questions and the team was really patient with me.Had an issue with my right clip not working well and brought it back to Bicycle Haus and they took care of fixing it while I waited. If you looking for expertise and highest quality bike and or gear definitely check out Bicycle Haus.
5	Thanks Kale for checking out my bike and fixing some minor things that could have turned into a disaster.
2	I used to be very fond of this shop, but the differences in attitudes displayed towards high and low dollar customers makes me re-think my original rating.  I had some very poor experiences and follow up with their fit service, which for what it costs should not have happened.  I also had a warranty issue with an expensive frame that I ended up having to deal with independently.I originally recommended the shop to two people and later had some very unfortunate reports back on their experiences, which was a bit of a bummer.  I like the staff members personally, but I can't recommend it to others anymore.People also need to keep in mind that many of these positive reviews were written by people who race for their old team, people who worked at the shop, people who were personal friends of the employees, or who have been a few of the long-time customers.
2	Wow nice looking place from the outside..i was really looking forward to spending my money there! However I was in the store looking around for at least ten minutes no one asked If I needed assistance or acknowledged I was there at all.   When I did inquire about a bike I got probably the rudest brush off reply, like I was bothering them. Very cold atmosphere, rude snobby people they work on bicycles for crying out loud, I almost had to laugh! I will spend twice as much some where else! They got two stars because they place looks cool.
5	Kale and the guys down at Bike Haus are at the top of their game. If you are looking for the most professional high end shop around then look no further.
5	We're from Lexington, MA.  We were in town for a conference and walking around Scottsdale.  My wife and I are bikers, so when I saw the shop, I had to stop in.  Turns out that they were throwing a bbq for their customers as a thank you celebration for their 10th year in business and 2nd year at that location.  Notwithstanding the fact that we were out of towners, they insisted that we have some lunch (excellent bbq, beer, and cookies!).  Shasta, in particular, was very very nice.  We picked up a couple of T-shirts because we liked the shop and the name.  Then when we were checking out, the guy at the register figured out that we were from Lexington -- lo and behold, his father (who happened to be in the shop at the time) was also from Lexington.  We had a very pleasant chat with the two of them too.  Bottom line, even though we cannot be regulars there, the folks at Bike Haus treated us as if we were long time customers.  That's what I love about good local bike shops.  As an aside, they have really nice kits and bikes there.  Some of it aspirational for me.  Support your LBS folks.
