4	Great service here! When Jack is working the window everything is always perfect. He makes sure your taken care of, always with a smile on his face! Nice people make your eating experience and mood change completely!!! I would give this location 5 stars if they didn't close earlier than normal Taco Bells. They are my closest location from home...
4	This location always has great food quality and excellent customer service.
4	Taco Bell is known for its fast service and this location is no exception. Food comes fresh minutes after you order it and I have never seen this one get too busy. You must get the Dorito's Locos taco as well if you're a Dorito's fan
4	This is an above average Taco Bell. I don't think I could ever give a Taco Bell 5 stars, but this one was really great. It's one of the newer updated ones, so the inside area was really nice. We ordered for a family of four, and although it was a little bit of a wait, everything tasted really fresh and good. If I'm craving Taco Bell anytime I'm near this one, I won't hesitate to visit again for the good food, nice atmosphere and friendly employees!
