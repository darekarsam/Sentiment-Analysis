4	Ok so I joined just last week but it seems cool so far.  I liked the fact I didn't have to sign a long term contract.  I can give a 60 day notice and I'm done.  The facilities are nice and well kept.  Staff seems friendly and offer assistance but they're not pushy.  Too bad they don't have a pool but then the cost would probably be higher.  I'm very pleased with Lifestyle so far.
4	My husband and I have gone here for years. The staff is great! Sorry to hear Leo left. The equipment is always repaired pretty fast so you don't usually have to worry about not being able to use your favorite machine. They have a great kids area with staff to watch your kids, and amazing group fitness classes like Zumba and Pump.
5	Lifestyle Family Fitness is a great business...they honored my 30 day comfort guarantee and I will definitely do business with them in the future once my daughter is well.
