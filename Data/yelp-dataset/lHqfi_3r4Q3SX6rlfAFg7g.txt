5	This new gem in the downtown core is an amazing new Italian bar/restaurant. They opened on Halloween 2014, so it's still brand new, but feels like it's been around for a while. The dark wood, the long bar and the wood fire oven give this place a charm I can't resist. The cocktails and the food are delicious, and the ambiance & lighting make it a perfect date spot! I was really impressed and I look forward to going back!
5	I had the pleasure of checking out this restaurant this week and I found it reasonably priced, good quality food and we had great service too! They are really starting strong and I hope they keep it up! The restaurant was really full, on a Tuesday evening, and I didn't find the kitchen slow and everything we ordered was amazing. We ordered the fried chicken, seasonal veggies, calamari, stuff pasta with squash, an assortment of cakes, jumbo shrimps and more. We all enjoyed the meal immensely. This place is only for 18+ because it's also a bar. As well I loved the washroom for its powdered soap and old English pull toilets and hidden hand dryer. Most importantly it was really clean!
4	This place looks awesome, the atmosphere is great and the kitchen in full view is top notch. The plates are on the small side, but I like that (usually too much food on the plate). And the food was great, except for that odd chorizo bread thing. Okay, the Fried Chicken isn't Montreal's best, but it's damn good and definitely NOT dry. The service was excellent too.
3	Service was as good as it gets. The restrooms are worth a visit by themselves. The food was ok. I'd say, a great place to have a drink with a good snack menu but a lackluster restaurant.
