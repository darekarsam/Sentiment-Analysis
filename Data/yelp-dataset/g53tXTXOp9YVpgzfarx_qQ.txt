3	I've been using Walgreens for about 25 years. I travel often due to work so I've had a chance to visit many, many  locations. This particular location is convenient for me, but lately there customer service has decreased drastically . The girls there are very rude and seem always confused and overwhelmed.
3	Solid basic Walgreens. Have all the stuff you need, this one is open 24/7 so that's convenient if you need scripts filled late. The front end is usually friendly, while the pharmacy is a bit hectic. You can tell from a mile away they are short handed and over worked but seem to try to make the best of it!
4	Whats not to like ! Its just your basic Needs and Things shopping awesomeness store ......your just in and out ....kinda quickie ! ..........OK no jokes about the quickie .......LOL .........Come on who doesn't like a quickie every now and then :)
