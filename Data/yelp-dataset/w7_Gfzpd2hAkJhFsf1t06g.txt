4	I'm going out on a limb here and propose that everyone who visits a this shop, enjoys flinging themselves up against the big rolls.  I think this is perfectly reasonable, you have to lay down on carpets sometimes, shouldn't we be able to test how that feels?The sales assistant didn't think so and nearly kicked me out.This place has a great variety of carpets, from the tacky stuff that's been on your Gran floor for 20 years to modern and tasteful alternatives. It's cheap too!
4	Rolls and rolls and rolls and rollsIf anything, it's a little dark, but there is an insane number of carpets and flooring options tucked into a small space. I dare you to walk into the annals of remnants on your own. Gwan...
1	Shop was ok nothing special but had some carpets that i liked but what it did not like was the rude middle aged woman turning her now up me like i was something stuck to her shoe i was  in the store for over 20 minutes looking at the floor and not once did she ask i needed help but shock horror when a well dress gentleman walked in the store after getting out of a flashy motor she was all over him.Well you might have got my money Edinburgh carpet warehouse but your staff cost you a sale and i spent my money down the road a carpetright.
