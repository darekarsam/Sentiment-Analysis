5	The salon now is very nice, very clean, and very relaxing.... All new people servicing... Very Nice! They do an awesome job on pedicures and manicures.. I LOVE IT ...;))
5	The nail techs are very friendly and welcoming. Dustin is by far the best nail tech I have ever been to. Prices are reasonable. I will not go anywhere else. Call ahead to make sure you get in with him without waiting.
5	French Nails is such a comfortable salon!  The services are great and everybody is so friendly and welcoming.  Victoria is such a sweetheart and I love chit chatting with her!  I look forward to every appointment I have with her! By far one of my favorite nail salons!  I don't live close but am happy to go out of my way to have such a great service!
