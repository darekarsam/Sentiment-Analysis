5	Dog food is made on site, by hand - available fresh or frozen. I like stopping by the kitchen but I usually get delivery. Ask the wonderful people who work there what's in it and why - they know their stuff!
5	I cannot recommend this place more. My dog absolutely loves his new food. On top of it being super healthy for him, the owner and staff are really helpful and friendly. Their dog food and their attitude, actually made me feel like they love my dog, as much as I do!
