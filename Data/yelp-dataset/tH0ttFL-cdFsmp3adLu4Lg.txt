5	WOW, talk about a gorgeous gym!!! You have to check this place out, you will be glad you did!!! This is one of the best crossfit gyms I have seen. Phenomenal coaches.  Checkout their free Saturday WOD if you want to check it out first...
5	Beautiful box! Coach Adrian was great. Everyone was so welcoming and helpful. I strongly recommend this place!
5	Great coaches, great members and a great facility. PIM is more than a Crossfit box, it's a community. Stay out of the Globogyms and get into Power In Motion, you'll know the difference right away.
5	I have been going to a gym and working out on my own for years with mixed success. Joining Power in Motion has been a revelation for me. I have been going for six weeks. The first four weeks were a Foundations class, which lets you learn the exercise routines so you can easily participate in the classes.During Foundations, which is a one on one training I lost 5 pounds and two inches off my waist. The amount of strength and muscle I going was amazing.It has been a great experience. I feel better than I have felt in a long time with improved flexibility and strength. What a great gym.
