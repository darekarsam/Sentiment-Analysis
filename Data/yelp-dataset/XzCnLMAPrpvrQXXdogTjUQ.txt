1	Rude, rude, rude! Staff would rather stand behind the counter and chat before helping anyone.
1	Poor customer service!I am never shopping at this Bath and Body Works ever again. The staff is completely rude and acted like I was not even there. There was about 5 of them at the front of the store chatting away. When I walked in they did not acknowledge me.  I stood beside them at one point looking at the product and still no acknowledgement. I was not the only customer in the store and I was not the only one being ignored. Associates passed by other customers and did not acknowledge them either. When I was leaving the store,there was still no acknowledgment.The only reason i am giving this store a 1 is because they had product that they discontinued and still had from their semi-annual sale.
1	I don't know why I try to shop here. Every time I try to check out I leave angry. The "sales" and "coupons" are never what they say when you get to the register. It's always the same story of "oh that item is not included in the sale." What a bunch of crap. Especially for lotion that is incredibly overpriced to begin with.
