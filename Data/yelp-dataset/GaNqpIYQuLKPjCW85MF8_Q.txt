5	Future Tenant is a great non-traditional art gallery. they focus on multi-disciplinary art, so there's always something different going on. they have traditional 2-D art shows, theatre performances, open mic nights, and public window installations. it's a pretty great place for emerging artists to get noticed. and during events there's an open bar, which is always a plus.
5	They do so much with what they have.  This venue is a eclectic mix of visual and performing arts that reminds me of start-up spaces in Seattle, WA.  They run entirely on student and volunteer efforts from Carnegie Mellon University.  Sometimes their productions are a hit and sometimes they are a miss but since the price is right it is relatively safe to make the bet.  Most admissions to my recollection are under $10.  During open mic nights for instance there is usually a visual art exhibit up  as well.  Twice the bang for your buck.  It is also one of the only places in Pittsburgh to see experimental work.Due to corporate sponsorship they frequently have free drinks (alcoholic and non) at their shows and openings.  A trip to Future Tenant is the highlight to most of my trips to downtown Pittsburgh and delivers a more consistent and affordable experience than many, more expensive venues.
