1	The worst chicken ever! They partially fry it and then keep it under a heat lamp until ordered. The result is grease soaked , soggy unedible garbage. The cooks/ servers also do not use gloves or hairnets. They just opened and have a D health inspection. They should have had an F because they are terrible. They do not season anything. Horrible.
1	$25 worth of trash. Look at the picture. We waited in line for 30 minutes to get nasty hamburgers some lame chicken french fries that were soggy all in the container here's the real show
1	I haven't even gotten my food yet, but I wish I had read the reviews before getting in the drive thru.  5 minutes at the menu board before they acknowledged me, another 5 before anyone came to the drive thru window to take my money, then after I paid she tells me it'll be another 10 minutes.  By the way- don't ask for onion rings in your combo instead of fries, you'll be rudely told there are no substitutions.   If the food is better than the other reviews mentioned, I'll amend my review, but for now I sincerely regret this decision.
1	After waiting in a drive thru line for 20 minutes for our food we get home (3 minute's away) to soggy over cooked chicken. The workers didn't know a whole lot of anything except how to charge my credit card. Horrible food don't waste your time or money.
3	When Mr. Chicken first opened it struggled with how busy it got and that resulted in some lengthy wait times. The food that I have tried (5-6 times) has always been good. Mr. Chicken is wavering on that fine line between either improving and becoming a long-term staple, or digressing and becoming an afterthought.I'd strongly suggest more counter help. One person working the front, back, drive through, taking orders, bagging food, and working the register just doesn't cut it.Fingers crossed for improvements.
