5	Doug was there for me with great advice. He is Honest, reliable, caring, professional and gets the job done. I would use Doug's help again .
5	Doug is a consummate professional.  He is knowledgeable, caring and kind. When I was in a very traumatic car accident days before my wedding, Doug assisted me.. Not only did he negotiate a fair and generous settlement, he walked me through every aspect of the case. I felt comfortable with him and I felt protected.  I highly recommend Doug to all those who need assistance in the area of personal injury law. As I understand it, he can represent indivduals in a car accidents, but also provides representation related to injuries suffered in many other circumstances.
5	Doug is a wonderful attorney. He treats his clients with dignity and respect. He represented me a few years ago when I was the victim in a car accident. I had no idea how to deal with the insurance companies and felt completely overwhelmed.He is attentive, professional and detail oriented. Doug took care of every last detail for me and got me a great resolution to my case. I would definitely use his services again and have referred friends and family to him as well. Thanks Doug!
