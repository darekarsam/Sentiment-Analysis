4	Pizza for my kiddos for lunch on a half day of school for $10 for a large cheese!  Yes Please!  Ordered online to pick up after I picked up the kids and it was ready and waiting.  They downed a large in about 15 mins, so I guess they liked it!  I had about a half a piece and it was indeed good, but I'm all about the veggies on mine!Love online ordering and drive through pickup.  Not the best pizza in the world, of course, but it was fast, affordable and just right for today!
4	Out of all the Pizza Hut's in the Charlotte area, this one is the best! I used to live in the University area, so this one delivered to us, which was a plus. I have also eaten inside with my family and friends. I ordered a cheese pizza, honey bbq wings, and breadsticks. It arrived in a timely manner, and I was starving so I paid the delivery guy and checked my food. Upon inspection of my pizza, I guess the guy had sat something heavy on top of the box so when I opened it, ALL of the cheese was stuck to the top of the box. The guy apologized, and called me in a new pizza. He came back within a decent amount of time, and my pizza was hot and delicious.Like I stated before, I used to love ordering from this pizza hut when I lived in the University area. Great customer service, delicious food, and atmosphere.
