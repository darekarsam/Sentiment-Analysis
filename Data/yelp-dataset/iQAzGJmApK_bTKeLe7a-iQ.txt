5	The best CrossFit gym in Vegas. Positive attitudes from the trainers and people who go there. Everyone helps and pushes each other through the WOD's so that everyone gives all that they can. You won't find a better group to workout with.
5	What to expect: bona fide coaching from owner/operator Omar Foster + group setting + functional fitness (squats, sit-ups, push ups, pull ups, deadlifts, kettlebells, box jumps, running, wall balls, olympic weightlifting, i.e., CrossFit-esque and CrossFit brand workouts) + camaraderie What to bring: positive attitude + gym clothes + water Results: fat loss + more energy + genuine self-confidence + improved focus and mental clarity
5	I am currently trying to find a new gym home. I'm not into the lvac type gyms. I prefer specialty gym because they are tough work outs. I visited camp fit force during the "share the love"(free classes were offered all week). I attended a Tuesday and Thursday class. Those happened to be the wod workouts. I do have experience with crossfit,  circuit training, and boxing.Omar is the greatest.  He has a great personality and really knows what he's talking about. The gym is very welcoming. I have one more gym to try out before I make a decision, but I'm thinking that the decision has been made.  Fit force, you know WHOOT!!!!!
