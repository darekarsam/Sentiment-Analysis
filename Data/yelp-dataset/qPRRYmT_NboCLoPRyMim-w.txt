5	A shop that's bubbling over with pleasant smells and colourful products, the Soap Co goes for the classical style of soap branding (think of Pears and Dove) but it's combined with the modern ethic of using natural ingredients in their products!Coloured in toned down shades and packed with components that actually prove to be good for you, the Soap Co's soaps have a nice warm, musky aroma. They have everything, from aloe products sure to wake you up to spicy smelling bath soaps. They also sell ranges of liop balm and body lotion if one wishes to pamper oneself for a night (men included, since they do a masculine range!)For gifts and for you, the Soap Co sell high quality, well made body lotions. Organic and homemade, although you'll be paying a little extra than what you would on the high street, your skin will thank you later. I hate to compare it to Lush because their traditional style has a totally different appeal, but in terms of ethic and choice between products it's on a par. Lovely jubbly.
