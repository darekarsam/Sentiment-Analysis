3	Free Internet, and the unofficial meeting spot Monday nights for keeners that do "after-work-hours" work called Get Sh*t Done Mondays or GSD Mondays. First time I came here, I got a tea, and was amazed at the size of this place.  It practically begs you to freeload on internet, with its ample seating (they have a table that seats 16 comfortably, and just tons of space all around, not to mention plugs galore.) Sadly though, the tea I had was horrendous, I don't know why? I ordered an earl grey, I put the bag in myself, and it tasted dirt-like. BUT having said that, I got a V-8 the next time, and it was fine. They do serve food, and they also have some crazy looking desserts. Im certain all McGill Kids know about this place, but I was and still am fascinated by this 16 person table in the same way that I was intrigued by a 16man tent. Mind Blowing
3	Large place. Can be overloaded by students from McGill. Drinks are fine. Food is okay... Better than the 2 other places on this corner. Wireless network is quite unreliable and fails quite often. If you have to work on the network this place is not good but fine for offline.
