3	Located in the Eaton Centre food court, their portions are smaller comparing to other fast food restaurants for about the same price. The food is just slightly warm when served and cooked probably days ago. The Butter Chicken and the Tandori Chicken tasted pretty good.
4	Maybe not the best Indian,but whenever my craving for chicken Korma hits and I'm near here,this us where I come. So far,so good; the food has always been piping hot and tasty. I would however,appreciate more salad than starch with starch..... potatoes AND rice on the plate. Overall though,pretty good for fast food.
2	-their salade is just uneatable , is like they opened a can of cheakpea and put it in your plate .-their Naan bread has nothing to to with the real Naan , its like wet and re-heated.-i can give them some credit for the cari.
