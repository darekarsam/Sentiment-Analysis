1	I found a hair in my salad!!
3	A bit nostalgic for me. I use to come here every day after middle school and pick up a Tony Special, which is a terrific italian sandwich. They make decent food here, I actually really like their club sandwich.
4	i would definitely call this place again for delivery. the pasta primavera was excellent even though it was in a carry out container. the guy on the phone said everything was made fresh and the flavor backed that up. open late fast delivery. if im hungry and staying in the area again i wouldnt hesitate to call.
