1	Lady behind the register yelled at me because she confused one number for another. Calm down, I graduated college, I understand numbers and I don't mumble. So rude.
4	Located on a semi-busy corner but it's easy to get in and out. If you have to go inside for anything it can be hit or miss. Sometimes you get right up to the cashier, sometimes there is a line. They now take your Safeway reward points for fuel discounts. There is a car wash but I have never used it. The water and air machine is $1.00 for 3 min. Not sure what the vacuum costs.
3	Not my favorite place to get gas. The lot is small and usually packed. It's in a hard spot to exit onto brown if you're going west.
4	Even though I don't like the location and the lot it's self is tiny. This gas station is very close by home and convent for random single items we might need late night or early morning.
