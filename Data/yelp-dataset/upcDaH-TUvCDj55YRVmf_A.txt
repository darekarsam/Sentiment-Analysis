5	Lori makes the best wedding cakes! They are super moist and the frosting is perfect. Not so sweet that it over powers the cake. She has lots of examples of cakes and works with you to get exactly what you want.  We had a three tier cake with different fillings on each layer and had only about a quarter of one layer left.  Everyone loved our cake!
5	We were BEYOND satisfied working with Lori for our wedding. She was easily one of our favorite vendors! She was soooo friendly and very patient answering any of our questions. We told her that we wanted something simple and she drew us out a sketch to let us know what the final product would look like. The cake itself was AMAZING! We ended up getting the pumpkin, apple spice, and carrot cake flavors and they were absolutely delicious. I was very surprised by this because it seems like 99% of the time, wedding cakes just look pretty but end up tasting pretty bland but this was definitely not the case. She even said that she would send us a replica of our top layer for our 1 year anniversary for free. Talk about amazing customer service! Lori was a pleasure to work with and I would highly recommend her for your wedding cake.
5	Excellent choice for a graduation.  Ordered a cake online and it was very good. Nicely decorated and delicious.
