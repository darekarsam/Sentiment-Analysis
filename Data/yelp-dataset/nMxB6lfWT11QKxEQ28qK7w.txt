1	Rude staff. Dealing with the public is rough. I get it. But if you don't have good customer service skills then you might want to try a different line of work. I didn't give the guy at the counter a chance to treat me like a second or third class citizen. I stood in a line 5 people deep and after I witnessed the way this man spoke to the first two customers I decided to step out of line and take my business elsewhere. This is by far the most convenient location for me to frequent but it's worth the trouble to go out of my way to avoid this disgruntled employee.
2	The location is convenient but I've had a few negative experiences with the staff. Also, I tend to get really unpleasant attitudes when I come in with orders I need to ship internationally, which is odd but definitely a pattern. I will say that friends and family have said the exact opposite and have great experiences so maybe this is just a hit or miss kind of thing. Either way, I don't mind making the trip to the USPS over on Spring Gate. It's busy every time but those employees are so much friendlier to customers.
4	This is a express usps location. If your looking for super fast servcie forget it. But if you have a package to drop off...its the best.Easy location and plenty of parking
4	This location is a great alternative the lines that wrap around the building of the post office on Russell. Definitely get to know the self service machine. It's amazing, go in, get out, on with your day!
