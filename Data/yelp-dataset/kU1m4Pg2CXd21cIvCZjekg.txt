5	If you're looking for a job, give QTI a try. I was graduating in May and summer was quickly approaching. I needed to find a job, so I applied and applied and applied. Nothing. I probably applied to two dozen jobs online, and walked into every restaurant to fill out an application. I was qualified for all of them, so I had no idea what was going on. I think people were hesitant to take a graduating student because they thought I was going to work the summer and dip (which I was, but I tried to hide that fact).I saw a bunch of postings online from QTI that I was interested in, so I applied. I had no idea they were a temp agency at first. I got a call, scheduled an appointment, and went in. The appointment was easy -- they just wanted to know my background, my previous work history, what I was looking for, and what skills I possessed. Within TWO DAYS, they had a job for me. Just filled out some paperwork, and I was employed.The job paid really well and I gained valuable administrative experience which I had none. They offered me a full-time position, too, but I was moving.Overall, great experience and I highly recommend them to anyone who has been looking for a while, but can't find a job.
1	So I applied for a position on their website which I was over qualified, maybe even over qualified.  I go in and do an interview with one of them and answer a ton of questions and fill out countless amounts of paperwork.  I leave expecting to hear back on a position, but NO.  It's been a month and I've never heard back from them.  I'm a talented individual with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science.  They never got back to me.  Worthless if you ask me, all recruiters are worthless, only looking out for themselves.  I got a position by myself eventually that fits my qualifications and salary expectations, not these worthless jobs they have to offer.  What a joke QTI is.
