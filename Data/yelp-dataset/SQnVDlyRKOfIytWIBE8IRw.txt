4	The staff here are quite knowledgeable and are good at recommending items from their stock or from stock available nearby. I usually stop in here for something specific, my latest being Innis & Gunn cask aged beer. They have a nice little wine-tasting setup where every few weeks they offer 1oz, 2oz or 3oz tastings of wines that you might otherwise shy away from due to price, or a lack of familiarity with the varietal. They usually also have at least one whiskey or other spirit available for tasting. Prices vary but are very reasonable.
4	I realize there is not much variation in SAQ stores, but this one is as good as the others I've been to (and they've all been pretty good): super clean, nice staff, decent prices, cute wine bags by the cash. The selection of spirits may not be as huge as the stores I'm used to in the States, but I rarely need anything super-specific - just your basic Absolut vodkas and Bombay gins work for me, - so this SAQ served our purposes well.
4	Staff were for the most part very friendly and knowledgable. They even stock the liquor that I normally have trouble finding. Would have given five stars if one of the associates hadn't hit on me. I appreciate the compliment, but when I shrug it off the first time and you try to probe again you're inappropriate with that customer. Good selection, could have thrown someone else on the cash registers when the line got long.
