2	Whenever I give two stars and see the description "Meh. I've experienced better," I think - Meh, I've experienced better.  I was starving when I got here so I felt like anything would just be lovely.  I can't go so far as to say lovely but it was adequate.  I ordered crab rangoons, and teryaki chicken.  The crab rangoons were good, not great and the side sauce was too thick, almost gelatinous.  The chicken teryaki was served with broccoli, brown rice, sweet carrot slices and shrimp sauce.  The teryaki sauce did not taste like teryaki.  It was almost a mix between brown sauce, and teryaki - not a good mix.  The chicken was not tender, but not chewy (just MEH!).  Overall, not impressed.  However, I did really enjoy their self serve Pepsi fountain.  I'm a Diet Pepsi addict so this was just a wonderful feature.  On the plus side, the girl behind the counter was very sweet.  Instead of just calling our order out, she made sure to deliver it to our table, and thanked us for coming in on the way out!
4	Great lunch.
2	Eh, just ok.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order boring food served by equally disinterested employees.   Next.
2	It's okay. Nothing special. I order the chicken Hibatchi large. It's a big portion probably would have wanted the regular size but wasn't given the option when I places the pick up order. The food was at first good but after awhile it was extremely salty even the vegetables. I wouldn't crave this place, still on the hunt for good Hibatchi.
