4	What can I say, I like it greasy. I like the option of bacon and smoked meat on my poutine, and the vintage diner booths that are not ironic, just old. The fries are perfect, the breakfast is huge and under 4 dollars and doesn't come with no fancy breakfasty homefries, just regular fries thanks. Often packed, and with good reason.
1	i'm all about greasy food, but this place is underwhelming at best. i live nearby so i go once in a blue moon when nothing else is open. the fries are alright, but the onion rings are probably the worst i've ever had. all that aside, i almost got run over by a nouveau system delivery car last week, who seriously sped up as i was crossing the street at a pedestrian crosswalk. be wary!
