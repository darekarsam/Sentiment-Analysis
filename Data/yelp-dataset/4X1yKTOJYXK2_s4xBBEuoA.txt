5	I hired Around the Whorl to do my prints so I could run my own background check while job hunting. Annmarie was on time and did a very professional job. I was so impressed with the service and price that I called her back a few months later to fingerprint my son so I would have his prints on file. Again, Annmarie was extremely friendly and put my son right at ease (he was a little nervous about the process). The pricing was great as usual and I feel better having a copy of his prints.Great work Around the Whorl
5	AnnMarie has been consistently courteous whenever we need fingerprinting for our state licenses and security clearances. As always, she was prompt in coming to our officeand made the process very simple... Did I mention that she came to us?... Awesome!
5	I recently decided to start volunteer work at a local hospital and needed a new clearance card, even though I already had my prints done for Real Estate.  AnnaMarie was so great to work with!  Very professional, on time and so easy to work with.  She even came to me!  It doesn't get much easier than that.  She also explained the entire process and the paperwork I needed to fill outDo yourself a favor and use Around the Whorl Fingerprinting Services!
