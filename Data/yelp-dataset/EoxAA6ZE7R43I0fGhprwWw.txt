5	I immediately fell in Love with CrossFit the moment I stepped foot into the CrossFit 400 gym.  The positive environment, peers, and coaches all tied in with the amazing Workouts just swept me off my feet.  My first free week trial was so much fun I cancelled my gym membership immediately and became a member here.  CrossFit 400 is my home away from home, everyone here is  like family and we all support one another down to the last minute on the clock.  Stop by and give it a try and Join the CrossFit 400 family, I guarantee you will not regret it!
5	Crossfit 400 is the best! They have awesome coaches (Shirley and Travis) and you will always leave the box feeling so accomplished. They will scale any workout so people of any skill level can participate. I am in the best shape that I have been in since high school and definitely owe my newfound strength and fitness levels to crossfit 400! They offer classes all day long so it can fit into anyone's schedule- joining this gym is worth it :)
