3	Decent food, really polite and nice staff,  but order got mixed up a few times on an empty night.
4	Every time I'm in Montreal, I make it a point to try some of the local Thai restaurants, because the peanut sauce is better than ANY I've tried in the U.S.Try the General Tso's chicken (enough for 2) and the pork dumplings with peanut sauce (AMAZING - like spicy, creamy peanut butter).If you're still hungry, I'd suggest the fried bananas. They come with chocolate sauce and honey on the side for dipping. Amazing. Only con is that the prices are higher than what I'd get in New York for a similar meal.
1	Food and freshness was below quality, with a fast food deep fried feel about it..., sad given the number of people there. Chicken pad thai was too soft and not fresh, the best thing was exiting from the rest when we asked for the bill, and went to Thai Express which was in a food court and the food was far better in terms of freshness and flavour .
2	Food was tasteless and terrible.  Lemongrass dishes had no lemongrass.  Veggies seemed fresh, but pad thai was bland.  Red curry was neither red nor did it taste like curry.  I'd give this place a miss.  Staff was nice (hence not one star).
4	Really good Wonton soup and General Tso Chix! Made on the fly as I walked in just before closing. Food was delicious and the chef and waiter were very nice and corteous!
5	I really like this place - second time coming good for mixed groups of vegetarians and meat eaters- second time coming and very good. I really like the soup (veg lemon grass) Plus it's bring your own wine!
