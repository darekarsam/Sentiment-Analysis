4	As was pointed out by Marj. C, this place is a take away, not a cafe selling yuppies continental coffee and croissants. Instead think chips, greasy pizza's and kebabs. To be honest, i Have only ever been in here once - and found that its just a standard counter and see-through glass box thing where the food is kept with a few chairs.The real glory is the fact you can order your food online and have it delivered. And what food it is - the kebabs are not your  usual grease drenched dog leg, they are well cooked and as far as I can tell - pretty fresh and good quality. The chips are good too, as are the prices - but be warned, while I am praising this place for its online service - the actual staff are a bit moody and often rude. Still, you come here for the food, right - and thats good!

The latest problem being they had run out of something (called me to tell me), then an hour late I called to see what was happening and the driver had been stopped by the police.  When it finally arrived, I was expected to pay for cold pizza.  I'm fed up with this place quite frankly.
