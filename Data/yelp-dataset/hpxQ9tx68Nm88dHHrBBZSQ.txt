5	I recently visited this store since I had a problem with my phone while traveling in LV. The lady that helped me was so nice and friendly. She always had a smile on her face and even gave me some tips on how I can make my phone work better! I didn't get her name but if I ever come back to  the area I'll be sure to visit this store if I need any assistance =)
1	Horrible service!!! Waited over 40 minutes and the employees outnumbered the customers. How is that possible? Manager kept saying only 3 more people in front of you  and then 2. Employees walking back and forth from the back room. 2 employees helping a person and 1 holding the bag for the other employee. 1 employee just doing stickers on the windows. Finally he said his employee will help but he walked out because his shift was over.  3 people behind the counter and one customer. They looked busy but doing what? We had enough and left. Walked out ad never going back.  The manager did nothing! Just walked around with an ipad. How about helping a customer besides walking around and looking at your ipad. Also they had a security guard on duty. That might be a red flag for the issues they deal with. Do not waste your time. Go elsewhere. With I couldn't give 1 star.
