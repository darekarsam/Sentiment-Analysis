4	Very friendly staff, even tho it was only 3 of them. They still did a great job. $8 for unlimited bowling & covers your food. Good rock music while I was there but will be going back.
2	Place was not clean- tables were dirty, bathrooms were horrible. Too close for comfort at the lanes when bowling next to another family.
