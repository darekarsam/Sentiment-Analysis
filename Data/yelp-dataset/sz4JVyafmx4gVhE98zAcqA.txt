1	Terrible.  I waited 25 minutes to get a 10-second answer to my question.  Implement some customer service triage instead of flirting endlessly with the female customers!
1	I am writing a review about the Cell Helmet Repair crew. They are pretty awful. I went to them because of convenience (close to my work place) and because they had a screen available immediately for my broken phone. Sigh.. so I went to the store and got my screen "repaired." Within an hour, my screen malfunctioned, so I had no working phone. They supposedly "fixed" that, but unfortunately, they fixed my phone in a way so that I could make no outgoing phone calls. Subsequently, I was able to make outgoing phone calls, but unable to check any voicemail.The gist of the story is that when I took my phone to Cell Helmet to get it fixed, I kept leaving with new phone problems that I did not have previously. I had to make multiple trips to get my phone fixed. The people that they have there to do cell phone repair are very inexperienced and clearly not good at what they do. I would never go back again to get my phone fixed there, and I would certainly not recommend this place to anyone.
