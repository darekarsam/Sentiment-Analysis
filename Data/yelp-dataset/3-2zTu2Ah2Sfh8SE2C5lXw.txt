5	So I have been here more than quite a few times and it has been bomb every time. They use to have this spicy sauce that will make you fart fire!! Sooo delish! I usually get the pastor tacos. A must try place if you are by downtown. They only take cash so get some doe before you head over there. The owners are super nice. Oh and they make their tortillas from scratch!
4	The family went to Luv It Custard for a late-night dessert run and just happened to see this taco truck parked outside the liquor store across the parking lot.  We decided to make it a whole late-night meal so we ordered some tacos.  We only tried the al pastor and the carne asada and both were the best I've had anywhere.  We live in Southern California so we have tried countless little taco stands, searching for a hands-down favorite.  Well we found it!  Unfortunately for us it's this little truck in Vegas!!  I can't wait till our next Vegas trip, we'll be stopping for these tacos more than once!
