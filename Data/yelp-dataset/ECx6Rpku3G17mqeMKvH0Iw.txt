4	No matter which Sally store you go to, there's always that feel that the walls are closing in on you because there's so much crap everywhere and the aisles are so skinny. This location is no different. Regardless of which store I'm at, the employees are always happy to help me find what I'm looking for, even if they're already ringing me out. They offer their advice about which products are best for what I need, and never try to upsell me on anything. Thank you!
1	Horrible costumer service. Didn't even want to be bothered. Was rude and ignored me. Also very small store and not enough employees working. I was left holding my baby in her car seat for ever until i got help.
