4	I feel like it's pretty hilarious that I am reviewing the little diner in the bus terminal in kitchener, but this really needs to be said: the breakfast sandwich, while super greasy, is ridiculously delicious. The people who work the counter are generally friendly, it's kept pretty tidy, and when you have a bit of a wait to catch your bus, this is a pretty great place to grab a quick bite to eat.
4	I am absolutely shocked at how good this place is, considering the location and all that. I highly recommend their breakfast special, their egg, sausages, and hash browns are delicious...all for under $5 as well! They do take a little while (5-10 minutes), so if you have a wait longer than 15 minutes and are hungry, this place would be an awesome stop to fill up your stomach.
4	The shocking truth: transfers cafe, at Charles St terminal, has the best pontine in the tri-city area.
