5	Great "small town" feel of the bank. Have always had good service with a smile.
3	I went in there today for a money order. Tell me why the clerk told me there's a $5 charge for the freaking money order?! FIVE DOLLARS?! Whet? Like who does that!? Especially when other places such as supermarkets or even the post office charge UNDER A DOLLAR! I had even checked the website before hand just to see how much the charge was for a money order and the site didn't give one. That's probably because they know $5 is too dang high! Unfortunately, I was in a rush so I had to pay the 5 bucks but dang. Lesson learned.  Do you know what I could've done w/ $5? Well let me tell you: Costco's gas is currently $2.50/gallon. I could've gotten TWO MORE GALLONS of gas. A $5 foot long from subway before the tax. An Old Navy t-shirt for the low. A pack of hamburger meat. Underwear, b/c you can't have enough underwear. Basically you can buy a lot of things w/ $5 instead of spending it on a dang money order.  I have a checking AND savings account there but charging that hot mess price smh. Also had to wait a good 5-7 minutes inside before getting help.
1	Do not bank with Tcf, bank teller closed my account because i made a deposit to my account and she thought the funds wasn't available. Do they even supposed to do this?
