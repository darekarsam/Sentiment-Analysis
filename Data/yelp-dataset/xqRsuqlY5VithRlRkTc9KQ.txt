5	Crossroads Farm is an excellent hunter-jumper barn with a trainer owner (so emphasis is on riding and horses instead of profit)!  A wide range of riders who have everything: ponies, quarter horses, thoroughbreds, and warmbloods.The prices are excellent, too.  I was surprised to find a barn within 30 minutes of the South Mountain area that is reasonable with excellent training and a fun, down-to-earth crowd.http://www.crossroadsfarm.com/
2	I thought Crossroads Farm lessons were good enough until I went to a different stable. The group lessons are not very effective and the tack is not in good shape. One lady actually fell off her horse because the stirrup strap broke.  Hopefully they have improved since I was there which was about a year ago.
5	My daughter loves jumping here. They take excellent care of our horse Todd. They have a team for junior high school age as well as high school and ASU.
5	Calla has been lessening here for two years. They take rally good care of our horse Todd.
