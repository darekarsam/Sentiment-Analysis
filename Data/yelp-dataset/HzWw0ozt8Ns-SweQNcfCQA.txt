4	I've been quite a harsh critic of Greggs in my previous reviews of some of their Glasgow branches. For the most part, I stick by my opinions that the staff are generally hostile, the food revolting, and that the continued success of the company will result in shorter lives for us all.In a dramatic twist of fate though, this particular branch has provided me with a few pleasant surprises. I once managed to get a morning roll with proper crispy bacon, and their new cake, the maple pecan slice is approximately one hundred times tastier than anything else I've ever eaten from here.Perhaps most shockingly of all, the staff were actually quite friendly and cheerful, despite their obvious feelings of misery. Good work Greggs.
3	Greggs is one of the big bakery chains in Edinburgh. Things going for this particular store:-central-cheap food (with good meal deals)-fast serviceThis not so good:- bad location in front of a busy bus stop- It's quite small for the flow of business it receives and ques at lunch time (all the way outside!)- rude service (although quite understandable with the variety of often rude clientele)- There are other more interesting sandwich places quite close by. These basically some up my points. It's ideal if you are hungry and need a snack immediately then head here for something warm and satisfying. The cupcakes are fairly decent as well.
5	Oh Greggs. I owe you one.I've lost count of the amount of times this place has sorted me out. It's hangover food essentially, but damn good hangover food!! They have brilliant sandwiches that are all made fresh daily, and their cakes are yummy. Their sausage rolls are what save my life.This place is almost always full of students, looking for their fix. It's always busy, and the staff are lovely. You can't really go wrong with Greggs.
