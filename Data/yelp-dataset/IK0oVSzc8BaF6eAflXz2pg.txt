4	A good shop where the staff will custom build a PC to your specifications e.g. case, memory, hard disk, graphics card etc. There's not too many places in Edinburgh that provide this service, so it's useful if you know exactly what you want.
4	User 2 Computers is situated in a prime location on South Clerk Street, a busy thoroughfare that means it is well on the radar of students and residents alike.  Like many independent computer shops, they offer a range of services - from sales of new and refurbished PCs, accessories and peripherals; to repairs and upgrades.I was almost forced into using this shop when my old laptop became overrun with viruses and spyware due to a poor choice of antivirus software on my part.  A quick search online revealed this to be the closest to where I lived, and so I paid them a visit.Their repair team were able to successfully restore my computer back to full health in a few days, and were also able to recommend a better antivirus product.  I found the staff to be helpful and attentive, taking time to explain the repairs in detail, as well as providing useful advice about how to avoid a similar situation in the future.Although the shop may appear small from the outside, the website belies the fact that this is shop that can do a lot for you.  I don't regret using them at all - after their work, the laptop ran for another 3 years.  I have recommended them to my friends, and I would commend them to you!  A great alternative if you want to avoid the massive national chain stores.
