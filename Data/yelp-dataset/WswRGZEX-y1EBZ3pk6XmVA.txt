4	Worth a visit just for the rotisserie chicken. It is awesome! It's the kind of chicken that after you finish your serving, you keep picking at it to try to find a little speck of goodness that you left behind, just hoping you weren't thorough. The owner is very friendly and makes you feel at home. Always a nice touch. The other staff members seem equally friendly. My only issue is that the menu seems a bit schizophrenic - like they can't decide exactly what kind of restaurant they want to be. For example, the mac and cheese is Kraft. Why even serve it? Stick with what you do best - chicken and Latin influenced meals and sides. Go though, try it - you won't regret it, just stick with what seems logical on the menu.
4	I will attest, for over a year I walked right by the roasting oven in search of other ethnic delights at the plaza fiesta, but to my dismay the greek place in the mall shut down and i decided to try something new. The roasting oven did not disappoint, chicken was and is super on point, their hot sauces are GREAT, sandwiches are delicious. Like so many other ethnic places, the owner/employee's do a poor job of marketing themselves (they just yell things like chicken when people walk by) but the food is great, service is quick efficient and friendly, and that darn hot sauce is so good (the yellow one). 4 stars it IS!
