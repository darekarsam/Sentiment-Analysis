4	This thrift shop has a lot of really nice stuff.  They had nice furniture, clothes, dishes, purses, etc.  They had a really nice set of china for what seemed to be a reasonable price.  The store definitely has items geared toward the residents of Sun City.There were some items that I thought were a little outrageously priced.  For instance, there was a large TV (the older design prior to the flat screens) for $100.  Back home Goodwill won't even accept these TVs.  Also, the purses seemed a little over priced.  There was a Coach purse for $85 which wasn't in the greatest condition.  You could probably get a new one at the outlet for close to the same price.I did like their special for the day.  Everything was 25% off except for items on the $1 rack outside and items marked "firm".  Most items in the store, other than the clothes, were marked "firm".
1	Prices are outrageous! it is advertised d they are giving 20% off excluding some things but u will still pay an unreasonable amount for used dusty items. mostly all of their Items are old and dirty. The place smells sooooooo bad.
1	Awful place to shop. I was in the store at 3:45 and asked them to turn the lights on in the fitting room so I could try something on. The person working said no because we are closing. I toss the clothes on the counter because I was not going to put them away and I certainly was not going to buy them. I said that is no way to treat your customers then the man working said get out of the store F. B. and don't never come back. He said some pretty nasty words.j
