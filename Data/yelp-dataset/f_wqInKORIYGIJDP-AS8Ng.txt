3	Have these guys on speed dial. Their General Tso's Chicken combo is my favorite!
4	Thankfully they stopped by our neighborhood and put there menu on our mailbox. We were in the mood for Chinese take out and didn't know who to try around our new area. We got the General Tso's shrimp, wonton soup and some spring rolls and for Chinese take out it was extremely good. The shrimp were big and perfectly cooked. They had alto of huge wontons in the wonton soup. We will definitely try them out again.
5	I love this place. It's the best fried rice I've found in Charlotte. Food is great, prices ate low, and the family owners are so friendly.
4	Our go-to carry out Chinese place. Great food and super friendly service! The proprietor's young (8-9 ish) daughter is always there and super friendly if you have kids. Our favorites are the shrimp lo mein, veggie fried rice, crab rangoon and General Tso's chicken.
5	Dude totally worth it man....
