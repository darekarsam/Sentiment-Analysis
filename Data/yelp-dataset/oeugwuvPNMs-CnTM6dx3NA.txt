5	Stax Steamer was recommended to me by friends. I just wanted to say how thankful I am for that recommendation. Tim was exactly on time, was very professional and did an awesome job on my carpets and stairs and I have a lot of stairs. Tim is the only person I will ever use again and I would highly recommend Stax Steamer to any one....If I could give 10 stars I would ....
5	I have used Stax Steamer a few times over the past few years and have always been impressed with the service. I moved into a home and thought I would need to replace the carpet and tile...but Stax was able to clean the carpet and tile (grout looked amazing) which saved a ton of cash! Tim offers excellent service at a fair price!
5	Stax Steamer is the best in the valley! Fair prices and Tim is a joy to work with. Thorough services and the fact that they use green products is such a plus.Wouldn't trust anyone else with my floors.
