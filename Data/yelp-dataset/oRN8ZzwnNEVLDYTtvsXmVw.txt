5	Great service, honest mechanic!  They talked me out of repairs that didn't need to be done.  They tuned up my bike and it is running the best ever!
5	Been into the store for parts a few times, got a VIN inspection done for a dirt bike, etc. Dealt with three different staff members here and each one was great. Super friendly, extremely helpful even beyond making a sale. Don't let the size of this dealer fool you, great people there. Not the traditional "no time for you unless you're buying a new bike" dealer here. There's a dealer just down the street if you want to feel taken advantage of...
5	You couldn't find a nicer or better place to have work done on your bike.  Tom is meticulous and super helpful.  Call first and make an appointment.
