1	Uggg. Went here during lunch this past week. Sux. The lady who did my nails was very stale. Now, two days later my nails are chipping the color. Not to mention the nail where half the acryllic chipped. Save ur money. Go somewhere else.
1	OK, so I went back in today to give another shot on having my horrible nails fixed. Epic fail. The lady who did my "fix" was named Jennifer. She seemed very aggitated at me like it was my fault her employee screwed my nails up so bad. While filing my nails with the machine, I had to pull my nail back several times for how harsh she was being. I have never had a fill hurt so bad. To top it all off, she didnt ask me about shape and filed them the way she wanted, which is not the way I like! She went to paint the whole nail and never asked me. I only get tips done. She was throwing my hands and tapping them instead of actually talking to me like a human being. Then they sat me in a chair where I had to sit at a horrible angle to dry the gel topping. I didnt even get so  much as an apology for the bad craftsmanship, At one point she even began pointing at my nails and talking in a language I dont understand, undoubtedly talking bad about me. I get my nails done every 2 weeks and I will spend my money elsewhere. This place is horrible. Not to mention, the salon was very dusty and not maintained well with cleaning.
1	DIRTY: OVERPRICED: BAD CUSTOMER SERVICEThis place does not seem to care if they have any customers. Its absolutely filthy, dust everywhere, the towels you rest your hands on have paint all over them as if they never get washed or replaced. The final straw for me which made me determined to leave this bad review is Jennifer used a tool to cut a hangnail off her own nails and then proceeded to use the same clipper on me without washing or even sterilizing!! right in front of me! gross! will never returnalso $30 for gel manicure...
1	Dirty, Dirty, Dirty.....will not be returning.
