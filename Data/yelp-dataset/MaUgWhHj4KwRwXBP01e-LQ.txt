5	I am blessed with natural waves and don't need to use a blow dryer or heat stylers.  However, I still need a good haircut that grows out well.  So pleased with the job Chanel did. Kept the volume around the crown as my hair grew out.  My scalp was also very itchy until she recommended I try the Sooth Organics shampoo.  Oh My God. Instant relief.  I don't know what brought on the scalp issue (speculating it was menopause), but I will use nothing else now. I've tried and the itching returns.  The final bonus is she's got a clever sense of humor. Yep, 5 star.
5	I love when Chanel does my hair. From the color, cut, blow out and styling she is very skilled and patient!. She takes her time and listens to what you want. I am always very pleased with the results and get lots of compliments on how healthy and great my hair looks. I also love that she doesn't double book while my color is processing. She is a great person to talk to and I love the time and attention she gives to me. I love Hair by Chanel and you will too!
5	Chanel did the hair for myself and my bridal party recently and I could not have been happier! It was a long and hectic day but Chanel made sure to keep on the timeline and got all 9 of us ready while working around the makeup artist. I have really thin hair that never holds a curl but was pleasantly surprised when looking back at pictures that I was still perfectly styled at 2am! Thank you Chanel for your professionalism and company on the best day of my life!
