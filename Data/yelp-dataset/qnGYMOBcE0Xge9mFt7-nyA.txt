3	Standard Premier Inn stuff, bed fine, TV fine, shower fine, no complaints for a one night stay. Improved by the proximity of The Brauhaus (qv). Close enough to the centre of the city for easy access, a bit too far to walk from the airport bus route if you have many bags. I suspect the restaurant will be OK, but why would eat in a hotel restaurant in central Edinburgh?
4	Well located for exploring central Edinburgh on foot. This is the third Premier Inn I have stayed at (the others are in Durham UK) and they have all been very similar. Rooms are basic, clean and modern. Staff are very positive, competent and helpful. The restaurants are considerably above average for a mid-priced chain hotel, with imaginative menus and people in the kitchen who clearly know what they are doing. The breakfasts included with our rooms were excellent. Wifi is extra. Overall a very good experience, particularly at these price levels.
