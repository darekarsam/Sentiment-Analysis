4	The location is easy to spot and when I went there they were really helpful and he didn't feel pressured into something.
2	The salesperson was very helpful and accommodating, so that was not the problem. I declined the $300.00 insoles but settled for the $77.00 insoles and bought Brooks Dyad 8 running shoes. I needed a good shoe to help with the Plantar Fasciitis. For the shoes and the insoles I spent over $200.00 and I wouldn't mind if they worked. But I hate, hate, hate the shoes. They are the most uncomfortable shoes I ever bought. I tried to take the insoles out, but it didn't make a difference. It was not the sales person's fault. But I will not go back. Foot Solution was not the solution.
5	Amazing customer service! They spend time with you and really care. They want to make sure you get the right shoe, not the right sale for them. They put you first.
