1	Stayed there a month or so ago and consider this review a warning...unless things have changed, the pool was empty and under reno, 1/3 of the rooms were under construction and the entire joint is in a shady area and I don't mean as shady with lots of trees. The staff were young but courteous (the only reason they even get one star) and when we came back a few minutes after getting our key because the door had a broken lock, the young lady at the desk changed our room no problem.We were on the top floor, the elevator was under renovation as well and was filthy. We were visiting from San Diego and when my husband made the reservation, we did not without knowledge of the area. Consider yourself warned....again.Free wi-fi was hit and miss and the motel is right off a busy freeway so it looks like a place that tired truckers and people who don't know better stay at. To the right of the motel is a huge, ghost town like, indoor swapmeet, to the left, a broken down, abandoned porn shop.I am glad we didn't get bedbugs...but we won't ever stay there again.
5	We were in town for a funeral and chose Quality Inn despite the low ratings, mostly due to location. We didn't see any of the issues in Big Mama's review . Sure, it's not the Ritz, but for the price it's quite a bargain. We were more than satisfied with every aspect of our stay. For about the same price as a Motel 6 you get much better accommodations, a more competent/friendly staff and breakfast. We look forward to staying here on our next visit to Phoenix.PROS:Large roomsComfortable bedsVery, very cleanLarge bathroom counterPlenty of hot waterTable and chairs in roomGood lightingLots of free parkingEvening staff is outstanding - especially Mike and SamDecent selection at breakfast buffetCONS:Weird square bed pillows are uncomfortable to sleep onWater pressure could be betterRooms short on electrical outletsDay staff is not as friendly (but still very competent)No snack vending machines - just drinksCheck-out time is 11:00am instead of noon
2	I am being generous giving them two stars - and that's because of the staff! We had our dog with us, so chose this place because they accept pets. Even though we are Gold Members - still got a smoker's room for 4 nights because of a convention in town. When we got there, three cop cars were out front - which should have been a warning. Pros:Staff are niceBreakfast is decentAllows dogsCons:Carpet is filthy - our feet were black at the end of the daySmoker's room was disgusting - even after being "fumigated"Asked for a comforter (it was missing)Asked for clean towels (twice) and they were never deliveredClosed "adult" store next door and panhandlers walking around the parking lotHot water goes to cold when the toilets are flushed next door or upstairs
5	I enjoyed the stay here. I've stayed here probably 3 times over the last 3 years and EVERYTIME I've felt like I got a good value for the money. This place is recommended as a decent place in Phoenix.
1	I would give negative reviews if possible. This was the worst possible hotel experience ever! I booked two days in advance through Priceline, prepaid and assumed my hotel was booked. I drove all the way from Los Angeles and arrived at 11:45 pm. When I got to the hotel/motel and walked up to the check-in with my bags, the man at the counter said he indeed got the reservation but had failed to have the room cleaned and prepped for a guest. No big deal, there should be other rooms available right? Wrong! I was told that the hotel was completely booked due to a softball game in the area. When I asked for another room, he said, " Sorry, there's nothing I can do."    When I mentioned that a hotel as fully booked as they are should have a full staff during such a busy season, he said he was the only person On duty and he would not prepare the room for me. I asked him to call the manager but he refused to do so. There was also two other families behind me about to encounter the same problem. Luckily I booked through Priceline and when I called them to inform them about the astronomical inconvenience, and they were able to get me into a 3.5 star Hilton @ squaw peak resort. I'll never make an attempt to stay at this hotel/motel again and I would advise against staying here to anybody I know. Epic fail Quality Inn!
5	Although I arrived very early, 10 am, and my room was not available, Gustavo Gomez made sure my wait was comfortable. While my room was being prepared, Monica Origel also checked on me. I waited at their bar/lounge and enjoyed some appetizers as I watched college football. The calamari was good, grilled salmon excellent and their wine selection is decent.
