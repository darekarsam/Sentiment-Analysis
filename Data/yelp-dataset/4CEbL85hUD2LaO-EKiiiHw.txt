4	You must be wondering how a DMV could get 4 stars. Let me say, "30 minutes!" I couldn't believe it either. This location was mainly for renewing your title and license plate. Besides being fast, the employees were friendly. I wish all DMVs were like this one.
3	Oh DMV....  there are just no words that can truly capture the frustration.  Don't get me wrong, I don't want to skirt around the law or whatnot, but they could make it a bit easier/enjoyable.  I was just dropping off a tag which took about 2 seconds when I finally got called out of line... it was about 20mins of waiting.  I just felt bad for those that had trouble standing for long periods of time.  There was an elderly lady that was having the most trouble and she was leaning on the line posts occasionally.The whole situation is pretty sad if you think about it.  People are aggravated standing in line... walk up to the agent aggravated and takes it out on them (usually the case).... the agent is then disgruntled and "over" all the negativity... and the cycle continues until 5pm everyday when the lock the doors.  I would probably put some money on the fact that there is probably 5 minutes when the office is actually bearable from 8am-8:05am... then its just downhill from there.
1	F'n retarded.... Avoid at all costs
3	No complaints from me, I've used this location the last 2 years on different days and I was in and out in 15 minutes.....unheard of.  The service isn't the best but I don't care about that.....this is a DMV after all......just have your money, and info ready.  I was able to do this on my lunch hour with no problem, see ya next year.....
1	So after rest frustration trying to GET here. This... Is not a DMV. It's a tag and title agency. Well at least it is now.
1	Wow each teller takes breaks between every customer, do not have any concept how lines or next in line works.  Lazy tellers, nasty building. Feces on bathroom door handle.
