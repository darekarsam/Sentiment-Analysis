1	Everything was spectacular EXCEPT the medical care I received. The waiting room, exam room, and restroom were spotless, and the MA and office staff were nice. The PA who was working on the day I COMPLETELY BLEW ME OFF. Ignored my symptoms, and told me that what I'd already done to relieve my symptoms were pointless (I know enough being raised by a NP to know that they weren't). She didn't even do an exam until I ASKED HER TO. She didn't ask me any questions, and didn't listen it what I was saying. She offered a shot of a pain killer and I told her that I wasn't interested in pain relief...I wanted to take care of what was causing the pain...a few minutes later the MA walked in with the shot. ATE YOU KIDDING ME? WAS SHE EVEN LISTENING?! WebMD will be more helpful than this place.
5	Visiting FastMed was, by far, the best urgent care experience I ever had. The entire staff was friendly, competent, and efficient. I was cheerfully greeted by the lady at the front desk. The paperwork wasn't too cumbersome or time-consuming. The lobby is clean and kid-friendly. I was seen very quickly and the medical assistant and PA were excellent. I was even given a thank you card that listed the names of the staff that I interacted with. What's great is that this location is a mile away from where I live. If I ever need urgent care again, it's a relief knowing that a great facility is close at hand. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who lives in the Avondale/Tolleson/Southwest Phoenix area. My hats off to the staff. Thank you for the first-class experience!
