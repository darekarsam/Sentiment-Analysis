5	Brand new location! Very clean and organized w friendly staff! In true 99 cent only fashion, they carry everything you could possibly be looking for in a dollar store. Picked up some butterfly shaped silicone ice cube trays!  :-)
5	OMG!!! A Ninety-Nine Cent Only store that's NOT in a ghetto, is actually clean and organized, and the staff was friendly and helpful? The end of the world must be near! I know it's brand new, but I do hope they stay the way they are, because no other 99 Cent store even comes close in comparison this one!
5	I love this place and you will too! I like their produce and always check there first before going to another grocery store. The cards are great. The store is clean and spacious. The people who work there are helpful and very cheerful.Its a great place with always a few surprises in store!
4	Enjoyed my brief $8.74 shopping trip, but I only wanted to spend half of that. Everything is pretty modern at this store and some of the deals for 99 cents are way better than the market. They had fresh peppers, huge green onions and nice stalks of celery. This isn't your grandpa's 99 cent store anymore, some quality name brand companies and items are available and the people shopping appear not homeless either.
4	Very clean and organized! Every couple of weeks when I go I usually find a few good items that you wouldn't normally see for     $.99 and they keep it nice and and clean. I just bought a few plastic travel coffee cups with lids, my husband loves them and its so much better than paying up to $10 for one at other stores.
