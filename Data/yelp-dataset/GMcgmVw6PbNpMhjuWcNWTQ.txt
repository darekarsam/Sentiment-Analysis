5	Oh goodness! So many options. Flavors and choices. Make pancakes, sprinkle on yogurt, put it in smoothies! And it's healthy too. What else can you ask for? I bet they have that too.
5	I own a coffee shop in the same Plaza as the Oatmeal Cafe and I can't start my day right without this awesome oatmeal!!!!  Very flavorful,  healthy and super creative!  Melissa can make it into pancakes, burgers, cookies you name it.  She carries incredible,  authentic teas as well.  It's a great place to hang out with your friends for breakfast or possibly lunch.  The owners are very friendly and always make time to chat with you!  Love this place!!!  Jennie
5	This place is awesome.  The Burgers are tasty the pancakes divine.  This place serves up Manna from heaven.  Hadn't tried the smoothies but from the responses of those drinking them while I visited they seemed quite yummy as well...But now lets talk about the people running the place.  Fresh and Friendly a Family Affair.  People are joyous in this fine, simple and clean establishment.  They have internet access and you never feel like they are in a hurry to remove you.  Terrific find and Wonderful Experience..  Thanks Melissa, Thanks Sam.Well done,
