5	Good beers.  Good prices.  They have quite a variety, as well as your old favorites.  A cooler in the back holds cases of ready-to-go beer.  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and even offers to carry your beer to your car if needed.One spot to park in right out front (I think it's a 15 minute loading zone), so you've got about a 50/50 chance that it's occupied.  Parking on Liberty in Bloomfield can be a PITA, but that's not Palanzos fault.Great addition to the Bloomfield/Garfield/Lawrenceville area and my go-to spot for beer purchases!  And as Nichole M. mentions, those cards at the register, always good for a laugh.
5	This place is great. They always have a good selection of local brews, new products and hard to find beers. The guys in there are also super friendly and nice. They always offer to carry my case to my car. Overall an awesome place with reasonable prices!
