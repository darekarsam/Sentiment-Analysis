5	I called PT Plumbing for a shower faucet problem.  They were very friendly on the phone, told me what the problem sounded like, told me the fee and gave me a small block of time he'd be there.  TJ showed up, calling first letting me know he was in route.  Very friendly, polite, and conscience about putting protective covers over his shoes to not track in dirt.  He explained the problem, price and had it fixed in about 20 minutes.  I would recommend this company to everyone.  It has restored my faith in the lack of good work/business ethics in Casa Grande.
5	Called PT for an emergency on Saturday afternoon.  The plan was to replace a ball joint on the main water line, but to do it we had to shut off the well that services a total of four households.  Well we couldn't do it cause the water kept bubbling up.  We were getting desperate cause no emergency plumbers were answering their phones.  The plumber arrived timely and fixed it quickly and we are very thankful.  In addition, he didn't gouge us for tons of money in correlation to our desperation as I suspect many businesses would have. in return, they've earned loyalty and a customer for life.  When we call them back out for work on the well, our neighbor is going to use them too.  In case you're wondering, we aren't related to anyone at the business nor did we have any prior interaction with them. Hire them!
