4	Went here for a concert, Deep Purple, and although facility was adequate, it was a little "funky." Here's the deal... It's basically an event ballroom, not really a concert venue. They set up the ballroom, convention seats in rows, and there you have it! It's not at all like stadium seating or anything remotely close to that. All seats are on one level. But, it seems to work! The venue was very clean, nearby restrooms were immaculate, and refreshments were available inside the "hall" and on the outside. Sound was OK, but it wasn't like 1974 where they set a record as the world's loudest band! I'd go to another concert if I liked the band, but probably not if it weren't a group or artist I really liked. Added bonus- I live about 10 minutes from this place, so HEY! Groovy!
4	Great venue, every seats a good spot for a concert. Just big enough to draw decent acts and just small enough for a great experience.
