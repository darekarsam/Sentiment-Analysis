5	By far the best towing company out there! They put your bike in the back of a pick up via hydraulic lift. Your bike is 100% safe the whole time, you don't have to worry about it falling off the back of a flat bed or swinging around on the back of a trailer. Michele is super nice and treats your bike as if it were her own.
5	Well, a bout a month back i had a very frustrating day, I was riding my bike to work, and the batter just blew out on me, fuse blew and the power stopped while riding..which was weird.  In any case, I was very gratefule for Arizona Motorcycle towing. Was recommended to me by my mechanic French over at Cyclewerks. This a great husband and wife team. The trailer is awesome looking - price was reasonable, and they were able to get to me withing 25 minutes of my call. Was able to pay with credit card - and didn't need to  follow them to my destination, felt totally comfortable leaving my bike with them to make it to my destination.
5	This was the first time that I felt confident with someone about towing my "06" Soft-tail. The Owner contacted me and worked with my schedule. When She arrived she got right to it like a Pro and she was friendly and knew right where I wanted to go with it. I got in my truck and drove to the shop where I wanted to get it fixed. She got ther and unloaded it and charged me exactly what she said she would with no hassels at all. Michele O., Owner/Operator of Arizona Motorcycle Towing & Storage will get any and all my business in the future. I highly recomend Her service...   Louis H. Grenzebach
5	Such a wonderful experience getting my freshly built bike towed from Michelle. She was gentle and didn't put a single knick on my bike. Very very reasonably priced as well as expedite service. Thanks for your services Michelle, I will use your services and recommended them without hesitation.
