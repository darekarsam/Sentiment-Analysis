5	Steve Tarrant has all my stuff.  Life, cars, home...  The other day, he sent me an email to give me a heads up that I would be getting a letter from the corporate offices that some stuff would be changing.  He just wanted me to know that he was watching it and taking care of it and there was nothing that I needed to do.  It saved me the hassle of making a phone call to check it out.He's got my back!
5	Having just moved to Champaign from Southern California (and an AWFUL previous State Farm agent/office) I was hoping we would be able to find an awesome agent. Steve's office staff was friendly, accommodating and went above and beyond with some of the requests we had. They were able to transfer everything from CA and get us up and running here in IL in no time. Super impressed with the professionalism but also with the warmness. You won't feel like a number here.
2	I'm been insured here for over 2 years. And I suggestion is "AVOID THIS GUY". I had issue with this agent twice!First time, I was out of the country for 2 months, and I changed the car insurance to "comprehensive only" which should be only $10 per month. But they charged me over $30 for a policy change fee. I know that it's state farm not this single agent makes the price, but this fee is never mentioned when I talk to this guy.Second time, I've had my drive license for 3 years and should eligible for a price cut. But they never notified me about this discount. And the result is: I payed over $40 extra money for an insurance with less coverage than my new quote half year.
