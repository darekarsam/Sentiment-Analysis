4	Festivals. Fun. Beer. Lots of beer. Charlotte Center City Partners (or Find Your Center) puts on a lot of these types of festivals Uptown and in South End. When you check out their website or their weekly newsletter you'll be able to see lots of events coming up like Beer, Blues and BBQ, Taste of Charlotte, Speedstreet and the like. Many of these events and festivals usually have beer available, hence why I'm a fan. And, yeah, I also really like supporting the local organization that's responsible for Uptown's development. If only there was a PBR festival...!
4	For fun in Center City, Charlotte Center City Partners has it covered!Yes, these are the folks largely responsible for the big ole event Uptown. Whether it's Beer, Blues & BBQ, Taste of Charlotte, Speedstreet or pumpkin carving for Halloween - I give these guys credit. Considering only 10-12K people live in Uptown, they have a large feat of bringing the masses into Center City. As a whole, these events are well organized, nicely promoted and generally a really good time. Stephen puts it well - every event won't be for everybody, but I appreciate that they try to bring Charlotte together (as we're a large group of transplants). In addition to the events, they also send out a really great calendar of what's going on in Uptown & South End every week. If you don't get it already, definitely check it out.
