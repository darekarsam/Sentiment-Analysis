4	This is a great place to get some drinks and check out your favorite local act!  This is quite a chill place, located across the street from The Dog Bar.   The place is filled with tons of friendly locals and drinks are reasonably priced.  I've had a great time every time I've rolled out here.  Admission is usually cheap or free for the ladies.  I'll be back to the Roux soon!
4	Roux is a solid dive bar/music venue.  Cheap cover, cheap drinks, chill crowd, and good local live music.  That's pretty much sums up what I look for when I'm going out in Charlotte, so that makes me a fan without a doubt.  It's a pretty small space, but that's what gives it such a great vibe.  You've probably been to that concert or show where the floor is a little too big for the crowd and no one really gets into it.  That's not the case here, it's a cozy atmosphere that will have you releasing all your inhibitions!The bartender was friendly and they also serve bar food that was eye-catchingly cheap.  I would assume that it's made at Boudreaux's next door, and if so, would be quite tasty.  It doesn't really seem like a place to grab food, but you never know when those munchies might get the best of you!I would liken the combo of Boudreaux's/Roux to Jacques-Imo's/Maple Leaf Bar in New Orleans.  Obviously not on the same legendary status, but that's what it kind of reminded me of.  This place fits the NoDa neighborhood well, check it out!
5	Nice little dive bar in NODA with a small stage for live music. I had no idea it existed until a friend invited me to see his band play there.
5	We are burning the Roux down tonight!!!  Last party ever.  Hope Scott gets a new venue ASAP!!!
