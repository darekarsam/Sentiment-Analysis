5	I've been going here for 10 years. My relationship began when I needed a bunch of clothes tailored for my first trip to Europe. I needed everything quickly and was very specific. She got everything done in time for my trip. Over the years I've brought dozens of clothes. She's done everything from changing a dress into a top to adding bra pads to a cocktail dress. She's hemmed and taken in. She's shortened straps and helped me change out fabric in clothing to create a completely different look. I can communicate anything I want and she'll have it done exactly the way I envisioned it. We've been able to change things so much we sometimes recreate new looks. Her prices are a little high but well worth the quality. Every single person I've recommended has been extremely pleased with her work.
5	I love this place! It's out of the way from both home and work, but I will not take my clothes anywhere else! the owner is a very nice lady!!
5	I LOVE this place! I took in a cut off vest to have a back patch sewn on on a Tuesday. She said it would be ready after 12:00pm on Friday. When my wife went to pick it up, I took one look at it when she got home and said 'This is AWESOME!'. This lady did such a fantastic job that it looks like I may have bought the vest with the patch already attached. I have a couple other patches that I'll definitely be taking in. She's also the nicest lady you'll ever meet. :)
5	She did a little bit on my wedding dress and altered a bridesmaid dress for me and she's awesome! She is really funny and a pleasure to go see. My whole family goes to Q and only Q; we love her!
4	She's friendly and charges reasonable prices for her service. I recommend her!
