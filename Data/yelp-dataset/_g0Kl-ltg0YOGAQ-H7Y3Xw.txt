5	There's one reason why I envy Canadians.... Tim Horton's.  Excellent coffee, pastries, daily soups, and sandwiches made to order.  I over-indulged everyday for lunch on a large coffee, grilled chicken sandwich, and cream of broccoli soup.  Since temps in December were many degrees below freezing I found it the best spot to warm up and get decent food in your tummy within a few minutes.While there's probably a legit reason and all I have to do is google it... Why the hell doesn't the U.S. have Tim Horton's?  I have to illegally eBay my Tim Horton's coffee in for goodness sakes.  So unfair...
