3	Cool concept, but not fully executed to its potential.  It is a baked potato/mashed potato bar where you choose all of your toppings.  The price was right, but the toppings didn't seem as fresh as they should or could be.  The staff had their friends/family in the restaurant and they were extremely loud...it was quite distracting being the only paying customer in the restaurant.
1	They have clearly no ethics, and have no idea how to run a business. Sadly, they are wasting the huge opportunity of this amazing concept.
1	We ordered delivery from Famous Potato through Grub Hub and I have to say we were pretty disappointed.  We had a 6 topping potato and 6 topping mashed potato bowl.  The potatoes tasted ok but the amount of toppings were really skimpy (MUCH skimpier than the spoonfuls shown in the video on their website).  The most disappointing part of the order was that we paid $3.00 for an order of croquettes which turned out to be exactly 6 tater tots with a little cheese sauce poured over them.  Really?  6 tater tots? HUGE ripoff for $3.00!!!
1	Worst experience ever.....I ordered the phone online I got the food on time but it was missing a lot of details and sides it's my first and last time ordering from famous potato
