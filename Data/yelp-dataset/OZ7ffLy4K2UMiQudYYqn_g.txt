3	Good location in the Cotswold area. Nothing new or surprising at this location...easy drive-up ATM that will get you back on the road in no time.
2	Sigh... I've found so many great places in my new home town, but BOA isn't one of them. I left behind a Huntington bank and I absolutely adored them. I have never had any hassles with them and my banking life was a breeze. Well, I needed to deposit cash because I didn't have my debit card on hand, and when I walked up to the counter, the teller told me that I was signed up for some kind of an E-Account? Granted that part is probably my fault, because I signed up the day after moving here and had no idea what the guy was telling me when I signed up. Well, if I wanted to deposit my cash, it'd cost me $8.00. I have NEVER heard that in my life! They said that my account was strictly for going to the ATM only, and any transactions made inside would cost me money. This is totally new to me, and I'm not very excited about it. The second thing, I never got my temporary card. I had to go in there and ask them to remail it. Very frustrating when all your cash is in an account that you can't even go inside to use. They have a few good things too, like the referral system, and the matching savings, but overall, I expected more.
