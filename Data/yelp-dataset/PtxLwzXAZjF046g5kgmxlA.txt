5	Dr. Martin Rocks!  I have been to several chiropractors over the years and the care I received in this office is exceptional.  I trust Mr. Martin with all my healthcare decisions and I refer friends and family in for his expertise.  Stop suffering form pain and go see him you won't reget it!
5	I would highly recommend Dr. Martin to anyone who is looking for not only quality chiropractic care but also a neurology background that provides a totally different insight to my health concerns. He takes into account your overall body and mental wellness, which means he finds solutions for complete systems, rather than isolated symptoms.
5	Can't say enough good things about Dr Martin and his staff. I have a chronic bad back that acts up with no notice. My chiro back in Vancouver, who I've had for about 7 years, does a fantastic job in "adjusting" me back to norm quickly. My recent experience with Dr Martin was every bit as helpful. The whole set up he has is professional from the second you walk in. Great receptionist, great tech assistant and Dr Thomas is superb. I will now be using him for my monthly adjustments during our "snow bird" stays in Az. Highly recommend Chiropractic and Neurology Center!!!
