5	I've recieved invaluable help from Ms. Danielson in relating to my daughter after multiple deployments.
5	I have been seeing Melissa for over two years and she has helped me so much. Her patience, kindness and knowledge has allowed me to make great progress!
5	I've been seeing Melissa for many years for personal and marriage issues. And she has helped me through some really tough times throughout my life. She has helped me find myself and realize that it's up to me to make myself happy and to be at peace with myself. I'm very grateful for that. She has never made me feel bad about my issues and stupid unlike some other therapist have made me feel in the past. Melissa is a positive professional person which reflects in her business. I'm a happier person, who is enjoying life because of her.
5	I don't normally choose this type of book she has written but a good friend highly recommended it and I am so happy I listened.  I feel like I was gently taken on a spiritual discovery that helped me understand myself and others.  This is a good read and good even be life changing.  She is amazing and so helpful.
