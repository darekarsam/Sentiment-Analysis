5	Oh how I love this rink!!!!! It's a little crowded, however I have fun skating. Nothing feels so good like working out your legs in blistering cold...shiver.....suddenly you warm up and say "OOOoh!" I love skating. :D
4	The Illini Hockey games are fantastic; that's my only real experience with the Ice Arena. Concessions are reasonably priced- a little less than a minor league baseball team on most things, and downright reasonable on others (especially candy). The stadium smells of ice and sweat, but it's a hockey rink- what do you expect? The biggest downside is that lines get really bad- hence the 4 star review. If you don't want to miss any of the game (and you shouldn't), get there about twenty minutes early.
5	For student admission is free , rental 2$. i have my skates with me. So all free. I love it. Place for joy for kids, adaults
