5	As far as McDonald's go, this location was A+.  Deona (sp?) was very helpful to me when making gift card purchases (30 different cards).  She was helpful and took extra time to make sure my order and transaction was accurate.
1	The next time they get an order right will be the first.   The manager I talked to (black lady in her 30's) was the most ignorant person I talked to. Actually yelling at me for wanting them to correct my order.
1	This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. They're always rude. They're slow. They frequently forget things or mess things up. And I actually had to cancel a credit card once because they make you pay at the first window, they take your credit card, walk it over to the dine-in counter and swipe your card there. I had been waiting for close to half an hour for food already, and I didn't realize the girl (who is almost always in the drive thru at night..and is also very rude) had never given me back my card. I didn't notice until I went to use it the next day. I just cancelled it because it literally wouldn't be worth the hassle to deal with these people to get it back. I'd rather drive further to another McDonalds.
