4	Go ahead and click the useful button if you're a UIUC student, or if you're  the parent paying the tuition.  This place has lecture notes for sale from not all, but many large classes held at U of I.  Grad students or competent seniors majoring in the subject will take notes, which are available as a study guide...or if you put away a few too many boilermakers the night before and couldn't quite find your way to class.
5	I swore by this place in College! They have notes from every class almost so you can stop in here before finals and brush up on all of that information you missed when you skipped class! You can submit your notes to Notes and Quotes and get paid but they have to be comprehensive and you have to show up to every class. Good luck!
3	Most expensive place on campus for notes.  However, cheap copy services ... $0.03 per page, maybe?
2	Boo notes and quotes for raising prices tenfold just b/c they were making illegal copies. No one should pay $150 for 100 pages of paper.
1	I hated this place because professors would make us go here to get course packets.  Why do I need to pay for them, why can't you just provide it to me for free when you're getting the damn syllabus printed!  It was especially the worst when you wait in line for 20 minutes just to get a 20 pg packet.
