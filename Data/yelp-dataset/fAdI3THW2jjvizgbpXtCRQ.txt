1	If I could, I would not give this place even 1 star.  The man that is there all the time, who is also the owner, ruined a silk skirt of mine and tried to blame it on anything and everything but him.  It was the worst customer service I have experienced in my life and that is no exaggeration.  He has extremely poor business skills and morals.  After a very long drawn out process  I received no apology, not even once.  He did give me the money to replace the skirt after me arguing with him on numerous occasions over a span of a few weeks and having to bring my husband with me.  When I also told him I wanted my skirt back to take it somewhere else, he lied to me and told me my skirt was not there any longer.  Luckily my husband saw the skirt laying on a table in the back and pointed it out to him.  We had to argue with him further because he said it was someone else's skirt.  This skirt is very unique looking and we knew it was mine.  After a few minutes he gave it to us in a rude huff and told us to "just go!".  Anybody who lies like that I prefer not to ever deal with in any circumstance.  Do not give this man your business!  There are plenty of better dry cleaners in the charlotte area.
5	I have used this place several times . the owner is nice, the service is fast and great. unlike some oriental cleaners you can actually converse in English. Sometimes he doesnt charge me for the extra service done, which i think is a great attitude towards the regular customer.
4	I'll say I'm a fan even though I can agree with the other reviewer that customer service here might be an issue.  You really have to get past that though.  The gentlemen that runs this place is strictly business and it's a business he's good at.I can't speak to the dry cleaning side, all I know is that if you need clothes tailored or altered, this is your guy.  I had lost some serious inches and he made my old stuff fit like new.  Totally worth it.
