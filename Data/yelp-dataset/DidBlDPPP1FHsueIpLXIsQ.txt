4	Roly Poly offers a variety of wraps, soups, and salads.  And if they don't offer the type of wrap you want, you can "roll your own," meaning you can pick whatever ingredients you want to create your own sandwich masterpiece.  The selections definitely seem healthier and look fresher than traditional fast food sandwiches (which is a good thing), but the prices for the wraps (to me) aren't that great for what you get, even with a combo.Roly Poly reminds me a little bit of a food court Mediterranean place called Hovan that I used to frequent in Orlando.  Unfortunately, Roly Poly doesn't have the Mediterranean side dishes of hummus and tabbouleh that Hovan did.  Overall, though, I can recommend Roly Poly for a quick, light lunch, especially if you're into food experimentation.  There are many combinations from which you can choose, be you a carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore.  Just don't expect it to come cheap -- think Quizno's, not Subway!
4	The nut and honey option is one of my favorites. This place is full of vegetarian goodness with like 10 different veggie-delicious possibilities on the menu. It's a little out of the way for me, but I head over there about once a week for lunch. In addition to all the options, there's just something kind of fun about a rolled sandwich. It makes it taste a little better, too, I think, in that the roll spreads the flavors around more efficiently than a traditional sandwich...not to mention that it cuts back on some of the carbs.
5	CLOSED.  This was a great restaurant with many vegetarian options and the shop owner was always friendly.  I went by there on 3/28/2011 and sadly, this place has now closed.  It's odd because it always seemed busy.
