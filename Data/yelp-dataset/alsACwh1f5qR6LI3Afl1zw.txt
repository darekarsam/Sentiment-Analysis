3	if you're just old enough to drink, you will find people of the same age here. the drinks are cheap, there are plenty of hot people dancing, and the crowd is not pretentious. the actual place has great location and the roof top bar is really a sight to behold.however, good luck finding anyone over the age of twenty-one there.
1	My friend and I were told about this place and warned it had a "younger crowd" - I have been warned "young crowd" can be very young. My friend insisted on trying it (her being several years younger than me I guess she was more okay with that). We were let right in on a busy night and we coughed up our $4 cover charge.I want my $4 back... actually I want more since I was traumatized.Walking into the club after a few flights of stairs (first tip off this wasn't the place for me was the comic style naked lady art decor), and I walked in to be absolutely assaulted by the smell of body odor. Very sickly strong BO. I fought really hard not to be sick the smell was that bad.As for atmosphere, I would imagine it's like the movie "Step Up" but in the thug ghetto. I was honestly scared. It's a meat market as well, which just added a lot to the creepy feel. I refused to buy a drink because I questioned the entire cleanliness. I thought about taking my Chanel earrings out because I was nervous of being robbed and cursed my decision to carry my designer handbag.Needless to say, I was out of their ASAP and i don't think you could actually pay me enough to go back.
2	The music was great but the crowd was way too young. And I felt like I was about to fall down the stairs climbing that horrible climb. No. Not again.
