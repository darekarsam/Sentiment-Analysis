3	This is MY Fry's!  I love this store.  Nice. Neat. Clean.  They have a vast variety of stuff and the atmosphere is a little more "upscale" while the prices are right in line with the rest.
4	This is my neighborhood Fry's and I LOVE IT!! It is very easy to get in and out and the fact that they carry Boar's Head Deli Meat is a huge plus++. Checkout is always a snap and if they don't stock something just let the Customer Service Manager know what you are looking for and they will usually bring it in.
5	I just moved to Cave Creek from So. Cal. I have a home here, and have had the opportunity to shop for food at both Safeway and Fry's. The Fry's store beats Safeway hands down. The prices, and selection are the best I've seen in a long time. The employees there are very pleasant and helpful. If you are in the area, stop by that store, and give them a try. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
5	I just moved here and the closest store is a getto albertsons. We normally shop safeways, but there is none around us. So we tried this frys and I have to say it is a very clean store. Very impressed with it especially their produce section. A+
