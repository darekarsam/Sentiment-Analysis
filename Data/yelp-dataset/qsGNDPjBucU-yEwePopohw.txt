2	You know you're broke when you even think about eating this. Marinara sauce tastes like it's cut with salsa, and the pizza crust tastes like it was brushed in margarine. Questionable all around, but it's even CHEAPER than Little Caesar's, so do you really have a right to complain?
5	Love their pizza. They are not over priced like most pizza joints. I have never been dissapointed. The pizza has its own unique taste due to the seasoning they use. AMAZING
2	Only 2 stars from me because I thought great $3.99 pizzas at first but they were over cooked and hard. When my friend and I walked in the cashier glared at us, barely spoke English, and when we asked if we could have a pepperoni pizza she gave us an attitude about it. She just kept standing there and talking in Spanish to some other customers that walked in. I don't know if it was racism or we just seemed like two odd kids to her... Either way being rude is bad for business. I also don't like how it is small inside and it's take out only...
