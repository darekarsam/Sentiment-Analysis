4	Being situated next to a sex shop,  Fresh Grind could be misinterpreted as some dodgy strip club . Sorry to disappoint, no boobs, just bagels.This is a cafe where you can relax. Granted, its not very big, but it has a cosy charm about it. The food is great, all fresh and locally sourced. They made me a special salad from a combination of 2 things off the menu and didn't overcharge. The best part is, I was in there for an hour reading and they didn't mind even as the place filled up. A staff member even came over and gave me a top up of black coffee on the house. Talk about service!
4	I second what Stuart said - Grind Coffee House is very nice.It's small but relaxed, and offers great food. Even if you can't get a table it would be worth taking away as they have a good number of Italian and Mediterranean options. Their food is fresh and you are given generous portions for the pittance you pay for it.Affordable and healthy, Fresh Grind's staff offer you good service and good food. Bear it in mind if you are from a neighbouring office and in need of a lunchtime pep up!
