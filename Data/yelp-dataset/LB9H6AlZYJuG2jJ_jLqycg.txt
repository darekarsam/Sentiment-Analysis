5	Georges is a hidden treasure.  I've been coming here since 2007 and tonight I met up with a friend for a famous smoked meat sandwich and coleslaw.  The legend goes is that the owner use to work at Schwartz's or has some relation to being involved with Schwartz's in the past.  I would say that the smoked meat is seriously on par with Schwartz's!  I know this is a bold statement.  Come check for yourself!  I've taken home whole brisket's back to my hometown and they will pack them for travel for you.  They charge by the pound and the brisket's are usually 9 - 13 pounds each!  When I was there tonight I saw they were smoking duck, turkey's and chicken's also!  I know there are tons of places for soaked meat in the greater Montreal confines,  but close to my home this is my go to place!
5	Who needs schwartz when we have Geroges!!! Hidden treasure yes, most do not even know this place. But I am a regular here living in laval unless I bring visitors from out of town, then we go for the real McCoy. Rumors are that this restaurant was suppose to be a schwartz but just before opening Schwartz was being audited by the government and George wanted no part of that and just opened under his name. Even the logo is the same. Good for him!!!I will be back.
4	The smoke meat tastes delicious. large portions at a reasonable price. I have found that ordering the meat "medium fat", yes I said fat, is the best combination of taste moisture and satisfaction. Quiet local place, so don't expect any "wow" factor when you walk in
