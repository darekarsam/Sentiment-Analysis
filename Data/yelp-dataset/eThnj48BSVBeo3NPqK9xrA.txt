5	You don't need fancy computer controlled cash registers and racks to get a shirt clean.  The husband and wife team that own Starmount Cleaners work six days a week and they have not yet invested in a computerized order taking system.  Maybe that's why they always:--Remember my name--Remember I like medium starch--Return my clothes quickly --Do so for only $1.50 per shirtI tried a lot of the bigger cleaners, paid a lot more money and was never satisified until I found this hole in the wall cleaners.  This is one mom and pop you shouldn't miss.
1	I am all for supporting local small businesses in my communi, butafter having one of my $50 dress shirts sliced in the same two spots on each sleeve by Starmount cleaners i would never return. The owner is very rude, denied damaging my shirt and tried telling me the shirt wore out. Obviously they are dishonest, and are not concerned with long term customer satisfaction. Further, they do their own dry cleaning in-house and do not do as good of a job as the ones who send it out. Avoid this place at all costs. If they damage or loose your items they will leave you out to dry, literally.
5	What can I say about Starmount Cleaners? Well, everything Brad Y. (4/13/2010) said and more! I take a ton of clothes to them on a bi-weekly basis and they always do a great job. Not only do they remember my name, but they remember my life events as well. As for ever damaging clothes, in the 8 years I've been going there they have only damaged 1 item.  The owner (who is not rude) brought it to my attention right away and paid for it (and it was a $50.00 shirt). I love supporting this hardworking family owned small business!!!
