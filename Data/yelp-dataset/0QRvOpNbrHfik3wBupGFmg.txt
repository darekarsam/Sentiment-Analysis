1	Sure if you have a crazy craving for a weird pie Marie Callenders would be a great place to go, but other than I wouldn't recommend it. The food here isn't great, and I would even consider it overpriced for what you get taste wise. Also the real reason I wanted to review this place is the service here is just awful. I have only been there about twice in the past two years, but both times the service was just REALLY bad. I mean these servers were weird and did not know what they were doing.Please Marie Callenders start screening your employees!
2	YUCK!I have not been cooking lately - busy with work and home...I went there for homestyle food and it was not good.  Also, like the previous reviewer, the server did not know anything about homestyle food.
3	Well i can't speak for the food..but the 6.99 deals they had on the pies at this location were great. We had 5 for the month of Feb. they only do this 6.99 pie sale twice a year i am told and it is definitely worth it. We had the lemon cream cheese pie on two occasions, the strawberry rhubarb on two other occasions, and the key lime to wrap up the month. I see some of the reviews on here are very old...please people go back and give them a try i promise you won't be disappointed by the pie at least.
