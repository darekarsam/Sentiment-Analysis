5	What makes Alta Mesa Chiropractic above average for me is the care that I get from Dr. Michone. She has a very uncommon way with people. She listens and hears things I'm dealing with way beyond the surface. It makes a big difference in my overall health which is amazing especially when what I had been used to was the wham bam experience, out in 2 minutes, kind of chiropractic appointment.
5	I've had lower back issues for years, and have never sought the help of a chiropractor til now.  With the help of Dr. Michone my back issues have soo far become an issue of the past.  Helpful, kind, down to earth, a good listener, and more than willing to accommodate according to your specific issues.
5	I went to Dr. Michone in hopes to rid my lower back of constant stiffness and pain that I had had for quite a few years. After just 2 months of being in Dr. Michones care I noticed a significant difference. Just a few weeks afterward while after I am completely pain free and I am able lift and bend normally. Thank you so much to Dr. Michone and her staff. I try to schedule an hour massage at least once a month. so relaxing and such a reasonable price! Wonderful Team!
