5	Bob was my buyer's agent and helped guide me through the home buying process in purchasing my first house. He was excellent in providing comps for the neighborhood and is very prompt and knowledgeable of the Phoenix Metro Area, along with his expertise in property management. I would use him again and recommend to colleagues.
5	Bob really helped me understand what I needed to do in regards to my investments.  He sat down with me for over two hours, read, and critiqued my plans.  It was incredibly helpful for me and I think his help has really made my portfolio much stronger! He is reliable, intelligent and trustworthy. Can't thank him enough!!
