3	We stopped in today for a quick lunch while out walking on Rue Sainte-Catherine. We both had panini - Dave had the Neopolitain and I had the vegetarian. Both were excellent, came with a salad alongside on the plate and were crispy, warm and fresh. The service was pleasant and efficient, but not overly attentive or hovering.It's nothing to write home about, but a nice lunch on a fall afternoon.
3	Fun, very casual bar. Great thon and olive sandwich. Was disappointed in the sangria, which was nothing more than red house wine with orange juice. Great view during jazz fest of the crowds circulating the area however. Great open garage door windows for cool breezes on hot summer nights.
2	We got the Chicken Panini and it was barely edible.    Bland, cold in the middle, not good.    Most people around us got the pizzas, which looked thin, crispy and yummy...maybe that is the thing to get here.Wait staff seems very busy and they forget to bring stuff all the time.  .
