1	Horrible. Said they could take me and a friend when we walked in. They sat her down, and I am still waiting 50 minutes later. It smells bad in here, the decor is horrible. I should have turned right around when I got a little sick to my stomach at the stench.
5	This was my first time getting my piggies worked on, so I didn't know what to expect.  My girlfriend and I showed up to the place 10 minutes before the place was scheduled to open. We still weee seated and worked on right away. The customer service was excellent,  they had a great tv they kept me and her entertained. No bad smells and the decor was very soothing and welcoming. My girlfriend says the prices were fair based in it's location, maybe a dollar or two more than normal. . But for what we received it was definitely worth it.  Oh and I forgot the massage chairs! !! Love the massage chair! !
5	The best nail place in North Phoenix. Great customer service, they have always been amazing to my family my husband and daughter. I can bring them any picture on pintrest and they always amaze! Prices couldn't be better too! Look up coupons too and they have 21 buck gel manicures. You can't beat them for the price.  As far as the wait etc come ladies lets be real. CALL ahead. It's not hard ask what the wait is!
5	I love jimmy tommy & Kelly!! Jimmy for manis, tommy for pedis, & Kelly for wax. They have the best selections of colors & brands. I love that there's a huge tv that plays movies during services. They stay open late & have the most reasonable prices. I always tip 30% plus because if the extra mile they go for the services performed.
