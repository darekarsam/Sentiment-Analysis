3	We had a craving for lobster on one of our visits to Jacques Cartier place.  We saw the sign for this restaurant when we dined across the street at Yardin Nelson on our first night in Montreal.We both had lobster and filet mignon.  The steak and seafood were both really good, but the sides were unappealing (the rice was too salty and the vegetables lacked flavour.)  The meal comes with salad and a dessert (chocolate mousse).  This was definitely the most tourist oriented restaurant we tried, but we still had a good time.  The service was good and the location is great for tourists wanting to stroll along the pier afterwards.
3	The lamb chop was properly cooked. The texture was great, but the sauce did not meet my standard. On the other hand, the most enjoyable dish was deep fried calamari. It was so tender and soft...it is a must-order.The service defeintely needs improvements though
