5	This store is awesome! I went in and found a great vintage dresser completely redone, at a great price. The owner, Donna went above and beyond helping me and did a custom nightstand to match the dresser. There are some European antiques here too. Been in a few times and always find something that I can't live without.
5	Faded, Frayed, and Fabulous is the BEST place to find your vintage items! I own a store front shop and bought ALL my furniture from them! The staff is friendly, and will help you design your space in detail. They take their time in finding the PERFECT pieces for your decor.  Donna, has GREAT style when it comes to this. She has a vision and creates VERY unique items that you wont find anywhere else! Stop by today! You will be pleased that you did. I would even say if you will fall in love with one item at least, thats a must have!
5	The owner Donna was extremely helpful and willing to help me with ideas for my bedroom design. We even moved furniture around in the store to try out concepts. Above and beyond excellent customer service. I also found the prices to be way more reasonable in comparison to antique shops off 7th ave I previously visited. I'm so happy with my purchases! I'll be back!
5	I cannot stay away from this awesome little store! Antiques, vintage, quirky and just plain irresistible items. I have found dressers, nightstands, coffee and end tables and I will be going back for a table and chair set I just have to have! Excellent customer service; you can't beat their prices and it's a great place to get new ideas for home decorating - BONUS! Seriously, I love this store and I am there often just so I can see what's new! Go check it out; you will most definitely be glad you did!
