5	Just opened! Fresh ground burgers and fresh cut fries are the bomb! Very well priced on the casino floor of the Venetian. BBQ burger, Fries and Chocolate shake! Ate there TWICE this weekend!
4	Overall, a really good from scratch burger! Fries were excellent... Think of Freddy's skinny fries with In-n-Out fries!  A little pricey... But what isn't in Vegas nowadays!  Haha!
1	Saw the reviews, and based on that, I thought I was in for a burger delight! Unfortunately, it was not to be. The burgers were extremely greasy and overwhelmingly unflavorful. We came here on the night of the Rock and Roll marathon so the streets were all blocked and traffic was a nightmare.  So we were mostly isolated to the hotel and I decided not to fight traffic and try this place in the Venetian food court. They got my $37 for two burgers fries and a beer. I should have wrestled through the traffic to get a real burger from In N Out and save about $10-$15.
4	This yummy veggie burger spiced up my heavenly eating . Very polite customer service.
