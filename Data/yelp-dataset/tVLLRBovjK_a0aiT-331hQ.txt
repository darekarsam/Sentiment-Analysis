5	Simply put, Jon Reed gets the job done quickly, honestly, ACCURATELY, and for a very reasonable/fair FLAT rate price.  His professionalism is great yet he is enjoyable to talk to.  He took my calls off hours with graciousness.  He answered my complex technical questions quickly.  He confirmed my suspicion of my ability to do a Set Aside without Administration for my father's estate, saving me over $2500 in legal fees and over 3 months in time.  If you have a probate situation (simple or complex), Jon is the guy to call.
5	Good experienced law firm. Personal injury and probate attorneys who give you personal attention at reasonable rates.  I have referred many of my clients to these lawyers and thay have all been pleased with the results.  These attorneys do the work themselves and don't delegate tasks to paralegals.  They return calls, texts and e-mails.  Gr8 at negotiation as well as litigation.
5	My wife and I were interested in creating a will and trust.  We called them up and they were professional from the beginning to the end.  Very knowledgable on all aspects and we felt like they gave us great advice.  Great father and son combo!  We will go back for sure.
5	My husband and I worked them recently on our trust/will set up, they were fabulous.  They are nothing fancy but do a great job at a great price.  They answered all of my emails and calls immediately.  Actually on my first call to them I had both father and son on the line, it was great.  I would definitely recommend them and will use them again if need be.
5	My husband and I just visit this office! We get our thing done in a timely manner and Mr. Reed took time to explain to us all what we had to know! Very professional, highly recommend this attorney.
