5	This location is a little slow even if you place your order ahead of time. pfffftt, although they are slow the pizza is always amazing. I love their stuffed crust meat lovers.The employees are like what ever you know they don't really have the pizza hut dedication. At this paticular location they have this one guy that yells instead of talking.The dining area is very clean.enjoy.
3	I like the pizza but not worth the long wait. We ordered a pizza to eat their and we ask for plates and they told us they no longer have plates. To order wings it was a 30 minute wait why !
