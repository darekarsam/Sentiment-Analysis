5	Simply the best!
5	We all get carpet cleaning coupons in the mail, or solicitation phone calls from companies offering a special. And, I dare say, we've all tried one of these "smokin' deals" (like 5 rooms cleaned for $50!!) and had soggy carpet for days.Your search is over for a really great carpet cleaner. Cal named his company after a basic tenet of his: Integrity. Yes, his prices are a bit higher, but  this man knows his business. He spent 24 years at ServicePro doing restoration & cleaning, air duct cleaning, mold remediation etc. He now just concentrates on carpet (upholstery too). He spends a lot of time making sure the job is done right. He is a consumate professional, and his thoroughness and attention to detail that Cal displays is wonderful. He calls the day after the job to make sure you are pleased - and if you aren't, he'll come back out. But trust me, he does such a great job, you'll be more than pleased.
5	I have used Cal twice. What I like is that he's the person you talk with on the phone AND the person who shows up to do the work. Very professional, good advice, and even though he warns you some things may not be perfect (unknown stains behind the stain, quality of carpet or fabric he's cleaning) I swear to you it is always perfect. Diligent, stays long after he thought he might be done and follows up the next day. Reasonable pricing and will adjust for whatever you want done. Can't say enough good about this guy.Nancy in Grayhawk
