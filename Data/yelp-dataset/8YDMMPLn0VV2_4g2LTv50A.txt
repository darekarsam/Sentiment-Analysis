5	Great service,i had a problem with my heater and called them to fix my problem,I absolutely made the right choice. The technician was in time and very polite explain what was the problem and how will he fix it,knowledgeable guy,and plus he worked so clean,I definitely recommend  them.
1	stay away from this place!!!! the owner is a nasty man and his office staff is incompetent.. took almost two weeks to get my repair done.. everyday was a different excuse and never any fault of theirs...
5	We had a problem with the ac not working in our home, the technician came right away and fixed the problem within 30 minutes! I will definitely recommend them and will use them again, I don't know what the lady below is saying because the owner was extremely nice and loyal...
5	I give these guys High 5's..... and I don't do that often!  They where sent out from my home warrantee service provider, something I always freak out about when they send someone I do not know. So, holding my breath  to see what this adventure would be like I must say they are now on my list.First call from the office to set an appointment was pleasant and painless.First visit the guy looked at the water heater made the proper call that it was shot, and once approved within minutes from the insurance provider, removed the unit and made it easy for us to clear the area that had water damage. He was just great about it....Of course because it was the weekend and I knew it would take  a day or so for a new unit it worked out as I split town anyway (talk about odd timing), so come Monday he was back on the job, placed a new water heater in used new parts and didn't try to play games using the old stuff  and did a clean job and within an hour I was back with hot water....Must say these days it's great to see people who take pride in their job and have good customer service
