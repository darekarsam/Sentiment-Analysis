4	Getting kitty stuff.  Always hard to pass up the cats and dogs up for adoption.
4	A well organized Petsmart, with a good selection of items. Compared to the Tempe Marketplace Petsmart, this one had more to choose from (I was looking for some dog sweaters in a certain size). The fact that they were all 50% off was also a plus!
5	This store has the most friendly and knowledgeable employees. This store also seems to have the largest selection of fish out of the 4 in my area. Our puppies love the bargain bin they always have toys just their size. Fun place to shop with your four legged kids!
