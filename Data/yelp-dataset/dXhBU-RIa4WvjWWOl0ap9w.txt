5	Dr. Dickerson is fair and I trust him completely with my teeth.  I highly recommend him!!
5	Dr. Dickerson Is not only a great dentist, he is also one of the kindest people you will ever meet.  He is honest and genuinely cares about his clients and staff.  My whole family has been going to him for over 10 years.  I still go to him even though I currently live in Seattle, WA.  I highly recommend Dr. Derrick Dickerson to anyone looking for a remarkable dentist!
5	I went to Dr. Dickerson in hopes of one day having straight and white teeth. Being scared to death from past experience, I told him, first, that I was scared, and second, what I wanted. He is so sincere and so gentle! His staff is awesome. Everyone cares for everyone. They make you feel like a part of the family. Now, a year and a half later, I'm in braces, my teeth are straight and white! If you have ANY fears of going to the dentist, I recommend him and his staff. I love going for my check up:)
5	Dr Dickerson is a great dentist. I'm really impressed with all of his staff, too! They do their jobs wonderfully and take the time to talk to you & get to know you. My hygienist there is very thorough yet gentle which is a big deal for me as well. I would absolutely recommend them in a heartbeat to anyone who needs a good dentist. :)
