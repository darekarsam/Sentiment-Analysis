5	Just had the best customer service ever at this location! I thought I didn't like Staples, since the Monroeville store has absolutely no knowledge about their products or any urgency to learn about them. Stop by the Banksville road local, if you're near by!
3	Meh. I hate how this store is laid out, and everything is tackily displayed. I also hate how they gouge you for printer ink. Huge store, not much going on inside. Too bad it's so close.
