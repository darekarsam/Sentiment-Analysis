1	Came here on a holiday (June 24TH). Very dissatisfied. Employees lounging around, mumbling waiter, dry food... I guess the staff here today would rather be home watching fifa. Hopefully for the owner the food and atmosphere is better on regular days. What a waste of time, thank god most plates are only 10$.
2	Been there for breakfast at 9am on a Thursday morning. The whole restaurant was empty and the air conditionning was running at it's maximum capacity (it's was freaking cold in there). When my plate came by, it didnt took long for it to became cold. I ordered scramble eggs and english muffin instead of the french toasts. They made a mistake in my order (even if I was the only client to take care of in the whole restaurant) they gave me some pancake instead of the english muffin I ordred to replace the bread. It didnt took long for the waitress to notice the mistake and she immediately brang back my english muffin, but forgot to toast it. Kinda weird!!! The breakast was okay, but nothing "wow" there. Positive: It wasn't expensive and I had a good services from the waitress who was pretty friendly.
3	Went in on a weekday for brunch. Huge place but only about 4 other tables in use. We were the only ones indoors. Has comfy chairs and staff are bilingual. The waitress is extremely friendly and patient with us and was accommodating. I had an almond crepe that came with two scoops of ice cream-one chocolate, one vanilla. I'd say the scoops are very small and that the crepe is a bit thick and chewy. I could do without the syrup on it. My friends had sandwiches and waffles. I don't plan on coming back for the food, I think it's just standard. Service was excellent though.
3	Good place to hangout for shisha as that is what everyone was having apparently.I had some tea - it was from a tea bag and not so great.
