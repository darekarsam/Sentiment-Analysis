3	There's been a rapid decline in internet cafe's over the past few years, now that every one and ever thing has personal access to the internet. Places like Netversal have managed to stay open by offering a variety of services. In this case Netversal offers printing and scanning services, on top of its shop selling lots and lots of computer "stuff".I first visited Netversal when I was on my way to a job interview  nearby and dropped my CV in a puddle. I had fortunately emailed myself a copy earlier so managed to pop in, use their net and printing services, and get their in the nick of time. So I am perhaps a little bias after they saved my day!But Netversal is really a useful shop. It has a fairly small floor space considering their stock size, with an upstairs for internet services. Downstairs is home to all the computer bits and bobs. It specialises in specific cables and accessories for computers and general electronic goods. Just be prepared to pay a bit extra than you might online. They don't seem to always know exactly what their talking about but their particuarly helpful with the internet/computing services side of their business.
