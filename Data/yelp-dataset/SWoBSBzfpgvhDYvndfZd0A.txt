1	Absolutely terrible over priced peanut butter - did I mention the owner is a money grubbing d-bag whose favorite phrase is "take over the world" funny how Martha the jail bird Stuart raved about this company - they deserve each other or at least they deserve to share a jail cell together. Buyer beware !!!!!!!!!This company cares about one thing and one thing only - how they can line their pockets by selling you overpriced peanut butter!!!!!!!!!Remember just because it's high priced doesn't mean it's good in this case it just means it's high priced!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5	LOVE ME SOME YUMBUTTER.I'm a little biased because I've been a fan since their farmers' market days, but I just can't get enough of their peanut and almond butters. Yes, they're pricier than your average jar, but this smooth creamy goodness is worth it (supporting the local guys is pretty awesome too). Dark Chocolate Delishe makes me swoon just thinking about it.Pro tip: they released YumbutterGO this year, which is resealable perfection so you can enjoy peanut butter wherever your heart desires.
5	As a dancer, health and fitness are very important to me as well as having something easy to take on the go between work, rehearsals and performances.  I love yumbutter's to go pouches! I throw em in my work/dance bag and eat em with bananas, apples, and granola bars.  For breakfast I use the almond nut butter in a smoothie, or on a whole grain bagel.  It's by far my favorite brand of nut butters!
