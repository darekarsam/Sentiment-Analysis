4	I totally agree with the other girls - Moleta Munro just screams cool.They stock everything from fireplaces to decking furniture. Where I would usually swoon over everything in this shop but never be able to afford it, I can confidently go in here knowing that I can afford at least something. A candle holder....or a bike basket. They sell the most extraordinary things! The majority of their stock is, as Marj has said, really ridiculously expensive, but every now and then they have a 25% off sale, or offers in newspapers, so it's worth keeping an eye out.I am not ashamed to admit it, sometimes I dress up just to go into this shop and look around. I feel cool, so why shouldn't I look it??
4	Uber stylish, uber cool, Moleta Munro screams people who have too much money and need to show it in the form of a ridiculously overpriced abstract light bulb. Perhaps, I'm just jealous because I couldn't dream of buying half of the items here but I will admit that most of the stock is very nice if a little unpractical.I was drawn here the other day as there was a crowd gathered around the window staring at the biggest lamp I have ever seen. It's hard to describe but it was around 4 feet tall and the lampshade an stand all morphed into one. There was no light switch but it just stood there glowing like a massive, lamp shaped glow in the dark star. Strange, but quite cool.In addition to the oddball lamp they also have a tonne of mirrors and clocks in various shapes and designs that are bound to make a statement in your living room and various other quirky knicks knacks too.
