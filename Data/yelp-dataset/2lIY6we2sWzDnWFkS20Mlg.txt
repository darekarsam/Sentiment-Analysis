5	I've always driven by this place but never checked it out.  I was in a hurry and the location was convenient for a quick stop.  The two people working today were so helpful.  They gave great advice and steered me towards products that would fit my needs.  They seem to have a good return policy and rewards program.  I will definitely check it out again.
5	Best pet store I have ever been in.  The people are super helpful and knowledgable.  Hanna knows all about fish and helped us set up a new tank without losing so many fish.  They handle all the animals and allow us to hold the pets which makes great sense if you want to take one home.
5	Once again I am thrilled with this pet shop. They are knowledgeable, helpful, warm hearted and generous.  Plus they have baby animals that are comfortable being handled.  We but all our pet supplies here and visit for help with the fish tank.  Because if the help of Hanna and Antonio, we have kept our fish alive for much longer than average.
4	Veey friendly staff, a bit pricy but well worth it . store is always clean and vaccines special
1	We live in the neighborhood and went in for the first time last week.  The assistant manager is SNOTTY AND unprofessional.  Their prices are higher than Harris teeter. I recommend walk.
3	This is a decent pet store. It is not huge but they have all of the staples that you would need for your common types of pets (i.e. cats, dogs, rabbits). The staff is friendly enough. The selection is limited and the prices are way higher than anywhere else even Harris Teeter. I do not see the value to justify such high prices. I can't get myself to spend 3-4x as much on the same product I could get from Wal-Mart. This is somewhere I would go to get a "cute" trendy gift for a friend's pet or my pet on a special occasion.
