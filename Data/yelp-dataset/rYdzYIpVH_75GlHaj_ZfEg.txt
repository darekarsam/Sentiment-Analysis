5	This is a great little mailing shop that is conveniently located in Shadyside.  They do charge a little bit more than the post-office (I think 10%) but it is worth it.  The owner is usually there and is helpful.  It is never crowded so they can help you figure out the best way to send something.  I like that they even have some old post-cards of Pittsburgh.
5	USPS, FedEx and UPS services all in one place! They'll even do the packing for you, if needed. Super convenient and waaay more pleasant than the East Liberty Post Office.  I often leave with a feeling of nostalgia for old fashioned family business', something I'll never get from the kids at the FedEx counter. Even so, I wouldn't go out of my way to spend extra to ship from A & A, but it's great when you're in the neighborhood and/or need to ship from multiple carriers. And it's usually a quick stop. They've even come to pick up some unwieldy boxes from my workplace to send out. A+!
5	They are amazing!. I have been renting a mailbox here for over a year. The staff is super helpful and really nice. They provide all services and their pricing is fair.
5	I needed to ship a pre-labeled UPS package but couldn't find a UPS store in Shadyside. Or a post office. Or a Fed Ex. Why?! I was pretty peeved until I searched for a UPS authorized retailer and found that this place was right off of Walnut. Yes! I can walk to it! I dropped my package off for UPS pickup, and it was delivered to its destination (also in Pittsburgh) the next day. Simple, easy. If I need anything mail-related I'm headed back here.
