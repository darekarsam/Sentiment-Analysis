5	One of my favourite bars in Montreal. College/Young working professional crowd. Drinks are ok, music is french-leaning. There is a small dance floor in the back. ATMOSPHERE is amazing! There is plenty of space to sit, stand, sit at the bar, dance, etc.- best place to meet someone and have a conversation in broken French - people are very receptive to someone who is trying to learn their language. Happy hour almost any day is killer here.
4	After seeing a long line for Distillery (on a Tuesday), we decided to check out Edgars. It was a very busy little bar on Mont Royal with great music and $3 mixed drinks!  The bar has something for everyone with lots of great quiet small tables near the front window and a lot of booths/bar stools by the dance floor. Great atmosphere with a fairly young professional-type crowd. PS What do I remember most about this bar?  SO MUCH PLAID. I never figured out why, but if you have a plaid shirt (or hoodie) and like to party in the Plateau, this bar is for you.
5	Voila un bon petit bar comme je les aime avec de la bonne musique et pas seulement un simple CD mais un vrai DJ (probablement pas tous les jours). En gros si vous aimez les bon pubs avec une bonne mousse pas trop cher je vous conseil de venir ici. Il est aussi possible de danser car il y a une piste pour cela et si vous avez autant de chance que nous de charmante demoiselles viendront vous proposer de vous asseoir avec elles !Je vous conseil aussi de prendre un shooters de Blowjob !! Qui porte bien son nom mais qui passe tout seul !!
4	I'm really disappointed to hear that this place is closed! They had a great DJ the night I went in for some cocktails. The service was excellent, and the place was PACKED. I also got the perfect seat, right by the windows, even though it was that packed. Oh, my martini was delicious, but a lychee martini always is.Edgar, what happened?
