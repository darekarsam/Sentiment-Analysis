5	Dr. Joseph Candela at LV Urology is excellent.  He puts you at ease, seems very competent and honest and pays attention to your problems.
5	I like this guy, he is funny, knows his stuffcares about his patient and has little fingers(he is a urologist, men know what I mean)
3	This place is awesome!  If you don't mind waiting for hours at end. I am writing this review while I wait. Again! The people working here are great, professional and friendly. I had a vasectomy done and I have to say that I am very pleased with the results. Would I do it all over again? Yes, but not at this place. I understand they are busy, but come on! Don't book so many appointments. Ever heard of, "don't bite more than you can chew"?
3	Doctor's here are great. I see Dr. Gregoriev. He's super friendly, always makes you feel like you are the only patient he has that day. I don't know what the deal with this office is. I've been here twice and both times I waited for an hour and a half. They told me they are less busy around lunch time, but when I came in at noon, I still waited an hour and a half.They serve appointments for three different doctors here and the waiting room is always full of super disgruntled people who have been waiting an equally long time. You can tell the staff here is really stressed about it as well and there doesn't seem to be anything they can do. If you get a referral to come here, be prepared for that. I ended up getting in trouble for with my work because both times my appointments ended up taking about 3 hours: to drive there, wait, and actually see the doctor.
