5	It's about time that Dorval had a decent community focused coffee house.   And Urban Agenda is so much more than just some place to pick up your morning fix. The owners, Bob and Freda, have done a magnificent job in creating a hub where you can just drop in for a chat with them or the guys that work there and catch up on local goings on. There are always homemade goodies like blueberry scones and muffins on the counter and they brew their own coffee, which if you want strong, is actually strong. The inside is small but cozy and it can get a little crowded at lunch time but the atmosphere makes up for the wait for food with everyone talking to everyone and enjoying the down time. The panini's and salad are great and they have great bagels with cream cheese too. Very kid and family friendly. With one of the sole purposes of opening that cafe in order to give back to the community, they recently ran a tree planting day where six mature red crabapple trees on Lakeshore Drive were planted to brighten up the local neighborhood. Way to go guys! I am all in favor of supporting small family owned businesses and it's so nice to see at last one venue that takes pride in their surroundings, treats their customers as friends and is not just interested in profit margins.
