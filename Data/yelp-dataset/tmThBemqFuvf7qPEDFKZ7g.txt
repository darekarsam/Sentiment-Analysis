2	Not impressed with this shop at all.  Their product offering is sub-par and customer service is awful.  The only reason why we stopped by here is because we were referred by an employee from another SuperPawn....she said that they had a nice selection of silver jewelry, which was a lie.  The silver jewelry selection here was minimal.Return Factor - 5%
5	Great service, overall clean store, got a loan on my iPad tried 3 different pawn shops before this one and they gave me the most here, and l love coming here because all their DVDs are 3 for $5
