5	Cool clean place to get faded, but not in that way. Walked in around 11am on a Saturday and was back in my hotel room by 11:30. I lie the fact the they have TV's with sports on. That's atypical fed place to go. The guy that cut my hair was a bit rough but it didn't cut my head. Would definitely come back when I am in town and need a fresh cut.
5	This place is the shizzznit.  Very professional. I get my cut from J RICH, I can schedule a appointment before work,  and get in and out quick. This is the only place I go to in Las Vegas.
5	I believe they have the best barbers in Las Vegas, very friendly & down to earth people. I don't go any where but Premier Cuts & very satisfied with the results.
