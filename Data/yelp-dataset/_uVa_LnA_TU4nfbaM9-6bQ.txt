5	Arc'teryx makes the highest quality (and best looking) outdoor gear on the planet. The problem is you are going to need to refinance your car, get a second job, and sell some of your children for medical experiments in order to afford their gear. This store has most of their current clothing line, but only a few select pieces of gear. Prices are absurd, so you will often find this stuff MUCH cheaper on the internet.
