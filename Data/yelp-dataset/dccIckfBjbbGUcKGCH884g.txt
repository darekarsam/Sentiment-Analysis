4	I arrived in Montreal hungry. Since I had a lunchtime flight from Philadelphia to Montreal, I didn't want to waste my appetite on packaged peanuts. When I landed, a friend took me to a Chinese restaurant, La Maison de Guang Zhou.It was around 2:30 pm, and not crowded. The interior looks like any other Chinese restaurant. Alcohol was available, but I didn't indulge. Instead, we had warm tea that kept the outside chill at bay.We shared orders of a pepper calamari squid, a tasty fried rice, and a good, tender beef dish of some sort. This wholesome, happy, scrumptious meal fed me, and not for a lot of money. (Credit cards accepted.) Recommended!
4	I only come here for the lunch specials. They taste great, portions are fair, and the price is just too low.Oh, and the waiters are very friendly and the service is pretty hasty.
