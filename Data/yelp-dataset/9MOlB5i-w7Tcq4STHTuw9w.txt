1	Rhonda the buffet manager was very rude with our party. I was taken aback that a manager for this type of establishment would be as abrasive. For paying over $180 dollars for 4 people to eat BREAKFAST I would expect better treatment than this. I do not appreciate such a condescending attitude and complete humiliation after shelling out as high of a dollar amount. BEWARE OF THIS TOURIST TRAP. We will not be staying here again.
5	The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the decor of this place. It looks very colorful and pleasing to the eye.I have to say that this buffet ranks up there with Ceaser's buffet. I don't expect any buffets to be perfectly spot on with their food just because of the quantity they have to produce, but Wynn was pretty spot on.This place was clean and it had the vibe of a classy environment, unlike some other Vegas buffets.The dessert section is amazing! You have to go to see what I'm talking about. I felt like I was in the Willy Wonka Factory. The only downside to this place is that you will get super fat eating here as they have a variety of assorted foods from Asian to Seafood to Italian.The cost of this buffet is not the cheapest and there is always a wait so be prepared for that. Happy eating!!!
5	just enjoyed brunch at the Wynn Buffet! all i can say is we are full! Food was descent and deserts were really good!
1	I had a large group of people, and wanted to look at the dinner buffet before paying a lot of money on food. This was the only buffet who has security guards by the exit. Security was rude when I asked them if I could look at the buffet. I then approached the host, who was equally rude. Security made me uncomfortable by following me around after approaching them at the buffet exit. Obvious, Wynn is trying to to hide their expensive and (likely) poor quality food by not letting prospective customers look at the buffet. There are better buffets at Caesars Palace and the Cosmopolitan, so avoid Wynn's buffet!
