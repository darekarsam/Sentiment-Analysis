4	Pinatas is one of the few mexican restaurants with a 'modern' design. It's very refreshing to have zero = pinatas, blankets or sombreros on display.  Pinatas has more of a clean, minimal, slightly industrial look.Pinatas menu offers slightly 'fancy mexican' entrees. Better quality items with alot less grease. My favorite dish is the spinach enchiladas! There are some awesome Happy hour specials, BUT, at the bar and on the patio beware of the blaring sun. Pinatas bar faces West. (Sunglasses Needed after 3pm).FYI- possible melting and blindness may occur while chugging yummy margaritas.  Fry's Shopping Center at  Hayden/ Thompson Peak -just north of 101
1	I've really TRIED to like this place..simply for how cool it can be oh and that it's kid friendly and close to home if you've had a margarita!  For whatever reason I've tried the same menu item 2x now and just did not enjoy it at all.  Margaritas are good though!  Nice bar and patio area...I guess if you're just looking to have a drink...good little spot.  The END!
