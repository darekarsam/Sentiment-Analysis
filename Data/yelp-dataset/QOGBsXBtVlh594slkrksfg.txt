4	Vintage motor lodge meets upscale Chinese.  I consider myself a creative person but I never would've 'thunk it.'  It seems to work; fantastic modern interior with plush seating and a unique menu.  I went straight for the duck and to my surprise there was 'coffee duck.'  Well why not hit two birds (well one duck and one afternoon coffee) with one stone.  Smoky roasted coffee flavor drenching a nicely de-boned, crispy duck delight.  I only ate a corner as I don't do carbs but the pancakes were wonderfully fresh for those that do.  Duck in sometime.
2	Coffee duck was crispy and came with 2 cold paper-crepes. Shrimp dumplings were good. Fried tofu was bland.Sauces on the several dishes we tried were equally uninspired and disappointing at best. Not on my list for a second visit.
1	I have traveled to many places and I have tasted great Chinese food. This restaurant does not have great Chinese food. Tonight I ordered the Chicken Hot and Sour soup. It was supposed to be spicy soup but it was not. I ordered General Tso chicken which was also supposed to be spicy. It had one pepper in it. The chicken was overcooked and dry. There was not enough sauce on the chicken and the rice was very very dry. The service was worse than the food. It took 20 minutes to get the waitress to take the order. My drink was only refilled when I was almost done eating and it was by a waiter that was not in my section. When I finally got the bill needless to say the waitress was not happy because she did not receive a tip. This by far was the worst service I have ever sat through. I would have walked out had I not been with my boss. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
