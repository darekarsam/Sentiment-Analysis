4	If you like Mexican, this is a good lunch place.  Very affordable.  I think it's a better value than Moe's.   The staff is very friendly.  Sometimes they give you complimentary cookies when you eat in. One knock is the parking lot can be a nightmare.  If you go Monday-Friday between 11:45 AM and 1:15 PM, you are sometimes better off parking across the street at the medical office parking lot.I love the two taco combo with the chips and free refill pop for under $6.
3	Wow. Can't believe this location is closed. I was not aware that it had and tried to stop by to grab some lunch to take back to the office. What a disappointment.
