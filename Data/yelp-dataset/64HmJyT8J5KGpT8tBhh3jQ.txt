4	"No Soup for you"?- Not here! They have great soup and sandwiches, the prices are reasonable and the staff was very friendly and genuinely seemed happy to be there, so was I.I wish there was one by my office.
5	Wonderful spot for a quick lunch.  The food is fabulous and the staff are wonderful.  I went there with my 2 month old and a friend with a baby.  The man that took our order helped carry our stuff to the table, set up the high chairs, got our drinks and made the dining experience wonderful!
5	I absolutely love this place, and it's one of the spots that I frequent the most!This is the first Newk's in the Charlotte area, and I'm really glad its here.  It was started by the people who conceptualized McAllisters and you see many of the parallels in the business.  I work nearby so I go here quite often especially for lunch.  They don't serve spuds or deli sandwiches here, but they do serve very well prepared and very well priced food.  A fan favorite tends to the Newk's Q, which is a barbecue chicken sandwich with a very unique white barbecue sauce.  Very good.  Their soups are very tasty although I probably wouldn't get them in the warmer months, as they are pretty heavy.  The pizzas they serve are thin crust style, and are more than functional.  The ingredients they use are perfect.  Although, if you're in the mood for a pizza, a trip across the street to Brixx will probably net you a better pie.  My personal favorite here is the Ultimate Salad.  The salad's they serve are gigantic and I sub out the honey mustard dressing (spicy) for the ranch which is one of the best I've had.  I also love their Royal sandwich which has salami and Roast Beef on it.  Service here is counter service and can get pretty busy but it's well worth it and you can easily get through in an hour lunch.  Try it out!
4	Great food, quick service, nice ambience,good variety of pizza, soup, sandwiches and salad.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I recommend the "Italian" sandwich. I will definitely be a repeat customer.
5	This place is great, I am hoping that they open more locations in Charlotte soon.  This is the first location in Charlotte, the original franchise started in Mississippi.A great alternative to panera, or Zoe's Cafe.  All of the food is made to order and fresh.  I have tried various menu items and must say the spicy shrimp pizza and the Newk's favorite salad are delicious.  I don't know how they make the bread that they serve most of their signature sandwiches on but it is addictive. For sandwiches a must try is the Newk's Q a BBQ sandwich like no other with grilled chicken, bacon, swiss cheese, and white bbq sauce I have never even heard of white bbq sauce till I discovered Newk's and trust me I've been searching for a recipe ever since. All the salad dressing are made from scratch as well , and the truth is nothing in the restaurant isn't made from scratch.  For a quick lunch at a reasonable price you have to try Newk's.   This place is also very family friendly and offers a beautiful patio with outdoor seating they even have a nice selection of wine and beer.
5	Fantastic, quick, hot sandwich!I swung in late one morning for a quick to-go lunch. With plenty of choices, I opted for a hot chicken sandwich with pesto, goat cheese, red and yellow peppers. Hello, deliciousness!Conveniently and neatly packaged, I was able to fuel up and drive to where I needed to go. Very happy with my to-go dining experience!!
4	Newks has a great selection of sandwiches and salads. It is very fresh and the quality is very good. Great place for lunch or dinner.
5	FYI  - Yelpers just found out they are opening a location in Uptown soon :)
2	Have eaten here twice.  First time food was acceptable.  Second time was this week, and the service was awful. My coffee was cold, and with plenty of staff standing around, no one would come see me when I motioned them over to explain. And when I went to find a person, they fixed hot coffee, but wouldn't bring it to me.  I had a guest and didn't like leaving the table over and over to solve simple service and food problems.  Will be quite awhile before I go back.  I could say more but will stop here.
4	Went by the 'Express' in their name and decided to order some food to take home in between getting some chores done. Called in an order, drove by 10 minutes later and picked up some hot food.We ordered the spicy shrimp pizza and a sandwich, I forget which one exactly, but my wife and I loved both. I personally love the wood fried Spicy shrimp pizza @ Brixx and this one came pretty close to that.I'll follow up with another review as this one's solely based on my to-go experience.
2	I was here twice and both times I felt the food was average at best, and not worth the pricing. It's only pizza, sandwiches and salad and the trouble with that limited menu is there are dozens of places with a mile of here that offer better. I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy on my 2nd visit. 6 average sized shrimp, one leaf of wilted lettuce, and two thin slices of tomatoes for $8.95.  No thanks. For that price I can go to Johnny's Red Bowl and have a huge salad (enough for lunch) plus entree for the same price (including drinks!). When I asked the waitress what the white colored sauce was, being as I don't like heavily peppered sauces - she did not know. Worse, she giggled and was proud of her ignorance of what she was serving "Why would you want to know?" she said,  "aren't mysteries so much more fun?".  No ding-a-ling, mysterious are not fun especially when your stomach can't digest certain foods. Turns out it was a mustard-seed sauce which I felt didn't go with shrimp anyway. I find the prices between Blakeney and Ballantyne commons are higher than elsewhere due to the affluence in the area. If you want to pay double than go for it.
3	Stopped in on a full day of Christmas shopping for a hot soup and sandwich.The yound lady at the cash register was very young and pleasant, but i think the conversation with 2 friends (co-workers??? questionable since they just sat on their ba-donk-a-donks the whole time I ate.) about her "sorry" paycheck of less than $300 (yes I know about what she made this last pay period as well as it is usually upwards around the $400 mark. yes all this I found out in the little time it took to ring up and pay for my order.I placed my number card on the table stand, filled my self serve soda cup. place on my table and then adjourned to the very nice and clean restrooms to wash my hands.my order can fairly quickly after sitting and observing the quirky decor, that is inviting and colorful as well. there is a large high table that has a array of condiments for your salad or sandwich or even your soups. Jalapenos, capers, banana peppers, croutons, sweet pickles, crackers, and even some bread sticks. hot sauces, cracked pepper are also available.The soups change each day but the soup schedule is on the website as well as near the ordering register.I choose the soup/sandwich combo. which was a half bowl of soup and any half sandwich. I went on a Saturday and being I am from Charleston SC I was immediately drawn to the "Ultimate Crab" soup, I also ordered the roast beef with provolone.Well I was terribly disappointed with the soup! It looked very nice (picture of my bowl is posted here) but as I dug my soup spoon into my soup i noticed it contained a great deal of corn (not what I was expecting at all) but hey I place in my mouth and CHEW, I do taste some crab flavor but the crab meat escapes my sight, even as I dig through the bowl, to no avail I found NONE.  What was worse was the amount of pepper in this soup, I couldnt even finish my half a bowl because the more I forced down this not so pleasant soup, the more my mouth was on fire.  So i give up! I notice another couple at the register studying the menu and soup schedule, then notice the same slender cashier I had go get a small solo serving cup of soup and offer it to the customers. Why didnt I think of that before hand of getting a sample to make my soup choice????Now the plus was the roast beef sandwich! wow that was a great switch a roo from the soup I choked down. The beef was very tender, the bread was toasted perfectly, the leafy greens were crisp and chilled. and there was a pleasant tang of some sort from the condiments that were on it which I am not sure what it was but I enjoyed it.NOW, I loved the inside, the staff seemed friendly, yet some a little too laid back and comfortable, but I felt a little ripped off for paying $10 for several bites of soup and 1/2 sandwich and my drink. But I will give them another try and next time taste test before I committ to a soup!OH and although i did not partake they had some scrumptious looking desserts at the register and there is a open shelf cooler that has ready to go sandwiches etc for those who need to grab and run!
3	After a lunch time expedition to Petsmart, I decided to drop into Newk's for lunch.  Things got off to a bit of an awkward start: I decided to get my meal to go, and therefore got in line at the to-go counter.  After I finished placing my order, however, the cashier handed me a number and said to find a table and someone would bring out my food.  I decided that I didn't mind, and I ended up eating in, but why have a dedicated to-go counter if you're not going to assume people in that line want, well, to go?Fortunately, the food, regardless of whether I ate it in or out, was good.  My chicken pesto sandwich was pretty dang delicious, and the pasta salad side was good if unremarkable.I'll will certainly visit Newk's again, since Lord knows I end up at Petsmart often enough...
4	I'm struggling with what to say about Newk's. I want to give it 5 stars, but I can't. It's so hit or miss. It's in a good location in Blakeney, right next to Best Buy, and it doesn't have a lot of competition in it's category (fast casual). I would say McAllister's is a competitor; however, Newk's is owned by McAllister's. One of my favorite things on the menu is the Newk's Q. It's a warm sandwich with sliced chicken, cheese, bacon (which I don't get), and a white barbecue sauce which is quite good. When Newk's first opened, the sandwich was awesome. The chicken was fresh, all white, and delicious. As time went on, the sandwich kept getting worse and worse--the chicken would have brown edges that were unattractive, the amount of chicken was less, and there wasn't enough sauce. Then it got better again, back to where it started. Then it dropped off a bit. It's really a fantastic sandwich when it's at it's best, but that's not all of the time.The salads are very good for the most part, and the pizzas are okay--nothing to write home about. Service is very good. You place your order at the counter and they serve it to you and check on you sometimes, so it's minimalistic, but really no problems. Decor is nice, it almost has a California vibe, which is nice for a fast casual place. Overall, I would recommend Newk's because it's a probably one of the better fast casual places in the area (not a fan of McAllister's at all).
4	Great place! The food is good and the owner is from New Orleans and they have ABITA beer!ddc
4	This  is a great little place to stop in for a quick bite if you are looking for soups, sandwiches, or pizzas.  I ordered a soup & half sandwich combo - and chose the chicken tortilla soup and pimento cheese w/tomato sandwich.  The soup came out hot and was very tasty.  The sandwich was quite tasty, but a little messy.  I thought prices were reasonable for what you get.  Since I am a fan of good soup, I will certainly be going back to check out some of their other soup offerings.
3	Newk's sets the standard for a Sunday afternoon lunch. Plenty of choices for the culinarily comfortable eaters and those seeking a gratuitous amount of crudite. Very fast service, ample seating and plenty of vittles whiel waiting for your meal to arrive. One of my favorite aspects of Newk's is the fact they give you gigantic, plastic stadium cups each time you order a drink. It's a size fit for a neanderthal and is perfect for hot summer days at home. Fill it with ice water, a sports drink or to the brim with a margarita. Perfect for all boozy occasions. Of lesser importance to most, but high on my appreciation scale, are the packs of breadsticks. Basically long, skinny crackers that come 5-6 per pack. Grab a few of these and some banana peppers and you've got yourself a righteous snack. Plenty of salads, pizzas, sandwiches and stadard side items. I'm a fan of the Newk's Q, bbq sandwich-esque with chicken. The Bread isn't ideal, but the flavors are great. Newk's is always a solid choice and is never over the top or sub par. Just right, so to speak. Thanks for the snappy and always friendly service, Newk's! You've got fans in us!
1	Food: outstanding staffing: immature management: much to be desired Atmosphere: dated Dust on lighting fixtures and equipment. Dirty silverware received by myself and my companion. Dirt on my companions Togo cup. The number we received to mark our table was disgustingly sticky. Soda area looked like it has not been properly wiped down in a week.
3	The food was OK, mccallisters is better but I would go back.  It's the same type of atmosphere.  They were very busy but they took care of us.
4	I highly recommend the Newk's Q.  It's a nice place to chat with colleagues and friends, and has fast, amazing food.  Get yourself a Big Crispy too for good measure.  Overall I'm a big fan.
3	This place gets a lot of accolades for just have soups, salads, pizzas and sandwiches. Mind you, I only had the house salad and their vegetable soup but if that's all I have, it should make me want to come back for more....and it didn't. I've been wanting to try this place for a while and was not impressed. Their staff was very nice and accomodating but the food was not impressive. It shouldn't be too difficult to make a good vegetable soup and I'm not sure I've had many that I didn't like but theirs did not make me want to come back for more. It was almost too sweet and a little thick. I'm willing to go back and try other items on the menu but I'm not eager.
3	my choice: Toasted ham, cheese & bacon sandwich husband's choice: Tomato basil soup & Italian sub The food was hot, delivered quick and order was accurate.  We enjoyed the meal but wasn't something we would to visit often.
5	Great pizza. The strawberry cake, I purchased to take home.  My husband loves strawberry cake and this did not disappoint.  Love getting a 32 oz drink as I drink a lot of unsweetened tea.  So glad this resturant opened another or in Rock Hill.
5	I can't believe this place is a chain.  It's one of my new favorite restaurants...  The chicken salad is AMAZING!!
4	I cannot believe I have not written a review before, because I have been coming to location for over a year. From the service to the food, Newk's delivers! I try to get there on Sundays, the best chicken tortilla soup around, and the toasted sandwiches are always fresh and good! Great place for lunch with friends and family.
4	Great sand which sand love the Newk's Q sauce. But also try the pimento cheese  Mac and cheese with bacon it's very good. They also always give large plastic take home cups, not sure how they can afford to but they do. We also love the pickle bar and breadsticks. Great place worth trying if near any and looking for something a little different.
4	This is a good place for lunch.  Their sandwiches, salads and pizza are really good.  Some of my personal favorites is the Black and Bleu salad, the BBQ chicken pizza and the Newks Favorite salad.  The only down side is that the prices isn't as friendly as I would like them to be.  Other than that.... A great lunch spot indeed.
5	This a great place for lunch or dinner. The sandwiches are always pleaders and the salads are fresh and plentiful.
3	3.5 Newk's is great. The food and service are consistently good and the restaurant is very kid friendly. That's definitely what keeps us going back for more. I love the Grissini breadsticks and the roasted garlic they offer. My favorite is the Ultimate Salad. It's really good and really addicting. My mom has had the Newk's salad and she loves it. It would be nice if their kids menu offered grilled chicken or steamed veggies. This is a great place to go when we want something easy and stress free with the kiddo.
3	This place is OK.  There's a decent variety.  Prices are OK.  Food is OK.  There's nothing really special but it's consistent and predictable.  It's not my first choice but it's a place we will go occasionally.
2	After a so so first visit I took my wife for a quick lunch. Under pressure to order from a extensive menu, so we felt cheated that we might have ordered a better item. Food did arrive promptly but very average - salad was nothing more than a large bowl of romaine, dressing was pretty tasteless, sandwich was very inferior even to Jayson's.Value for money I'd score less than 2 stars. Well below average experience.
1	Seriously needs to rethink their phone etiquette. I called and was transferred a total of 4 times to place a catering order. Even got hung up on at one point. One girl even told me that I should go online to place the order.  HUH?! I called back and still didn't place my order.  Instead McAllister's got my business. Get your phone ordering and your caterers in check. And tell them to stop passing the buck.
