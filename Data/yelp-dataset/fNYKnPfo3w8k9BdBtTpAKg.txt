5	I have been a patient of Carle for many years, and even worked in the ER for 3 1/2 years. I have almost always been pleased with the level of service I have received. When issues have arisen, they are dealt with quickly and professionally. Hey, we are all human, and healthcare is a tricky field - the human body is a complex structure and any doctor can only do so much. Recently I have heard co-workers who doctor elsewhere in the community talk of their experiences and I must say, after hearing their concerns and stories about their treatment, I am SO happy I am a patient at Carle. Frankly, I think they need to dump their current provider and join me.
1	Never a good experience.Had not been here in a few years because the last time (after waiting 45 minutes to be seen) the doctor was hurried and dismissive. She also told me a healthy way to gain weight is to eat more meat. Does that mean a healthy way to lose weight is to do meth?Today, I finally decided attempted to make a new appointment (of course with a different doctor). Made three attempts:1. The doctor I need won't accept new patients. Yet there are no other specialists.2. Called general Carle #. Got hung up on because staff members don't know how to transfer calls.3. Called back. New person. Spent 14 minutes on hold waiting to be transferred to make an appointment. Hung up out of frustration.Shouldn't have to waste so much life just to make an appointment, where I will wait even longer, only to be dismissed because central IL doctors don't know how to deal with unique situations.
