5	It took us a while to find them but Union Cleaners is the best we have found in the Stallings/Indian Trail/No. Weddington area. Very reasonable pricing. Mr and Mrs. Park are absolutely outstanding and they do tailoring on site as well. Dry cleaning is always ready same day or the next.. A fantastic locally owned business.
5	Excellent, full service dry cleaning & alterations  Have been using them for the past six years and have nothing but accolades for them.  If you live in the Stallings area, you should be using them.
1	On multiple occasions they were not able to remove stains from the dresses, pants, etc but they charged me for the items. Not happy. I've decided that im not coming back to this place.
