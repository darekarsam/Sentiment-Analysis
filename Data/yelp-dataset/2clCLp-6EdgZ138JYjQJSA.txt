5	Nadjage is amazing. I've never had any waxing before, but she had a Groupon for a Bazillion and a month ago I took the plunge. She is a certified esthetician which means she specializes on how to properly treat the outter skin. I didn't bleed and had no ingrown hairs. By the time she was done with me, I had a very smooth front and ... Well, back area. She was very chill and professional. I'm making another appointment to do it again.The salon is very clean and chic. You won't be disappointed.
4	I found Nadjedge with the magic of Groupon. She's a waxing guru. My Brazillian was shockingly painless. (Ladies you know how important this is. Even with the tweezers!)+ New joint+ Affordable (Brazillian $35!)+ Highly skilled+ Provides a variety of waxing services (Guys should come here without fear.)+ Appointments can be scheduled online (www.styleseat.com/nadjege)+ Wide range of hours (And if none of those work call to request a special time.)I adore Nadjedge and am so happy to have found her. (My bathing suit area whole heartedly agrees :) Nadjege is exceedingly polite and efficient. The esthetician room is simple (but that may be attributed to their very recent opening.) A combination of hard and soft wax is utilized leaving a baby soft finish. (aaaand now you know too much about me.)The salon offers additional services. Hair stuff is available and they are looking to hire a nail tech. (The nail room looks great!) Nadjedge also offers lash extensions, massage,  and facials.Love her!
5	Nadjege is now the only person I will go to for waxing services. She is efficient, friendly, and extremely affordable. Her new studio is convenient and comfortable and did I mention she is the best waxer I've ever been to? Give her a call! Or a text, she's very accessible for scheduling appointments. Love her!
