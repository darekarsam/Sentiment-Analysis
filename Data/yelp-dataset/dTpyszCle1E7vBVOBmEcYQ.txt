1	Just had fish and chips, some of the worst ever. The batter was solid with very little fish inside. The chips had obviously been cooked ages ago and were  rubbish. A complete waste of money and would never go back
4	I'm obsessed with fried pizza suppers. One day I'll be fat because of them. This one was lovely...god I have another craving to go back...
