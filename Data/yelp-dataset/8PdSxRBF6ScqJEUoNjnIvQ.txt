4	Nice people, good haircuts. What more can I say? We've been coming to see Sonia and Crystal for years.
4	We love Miss Crystal and have been coming here for a couple years.  The service is fantastic the place is bright and clean.  The game and movie selection is great and they do an excellent job.
2	We came to this kids salon for my daughter's first hair cut. We were willing to pay $20 for a trim because she would be able to sit in a fun car and be entertained. I would never come here again. The salon was dull and dirty looking! Was hardly a "kid" salon. My daughter wasn't able to sit in a car chair or have anything entertaining to take her mind off of the situation. This place has nothing on Snip It and I should have just gone there.
