5	Wait, wait, it's only $3 for a carwash?  And it's the cool kind where you get to sit in your car as it's going through the wash?? My mom and I took the cars here to get them washed on sunny day and I couldn't believe how cheap it was.  The location itself is easy to get in and out of, but if you don't know it's there, it's possible to drive right by it.  For $3, the car gets a nice wash and at the end, there are stations to park with non-quarter operated vacuums to clean the inside.  You can upgrade to a more premium wash where they will vacuum and wipe down the interior of the car, but my mom is kind of psycho when it comes to cleaning and likes to do it herself.
3	Hello friends,Smells like Auto Bell in the lobby.Lol.. Free wash with oil change, and vacuum. Usually takes about 10-15minutes for your regular oil change. The guys there are young and pretty nice. I have no complaints.TTFN
5	Very friendly staff car wash does a great job. I have been going to this carwash for over a year and they have always been polite and respectful I would recommend trying them out because they are definitely worth the time!
