4	Small location adjacent to AJ's in the AJ's shopping center, right next to where the old Ritz camera location used to be.  Normally quick service here with polite staff, and parking is decent too.  I also like that they have their own dedicated spot right in front of the door entrance.
4	Great service at this location.I come here often to drop off prepaid package often and everything goes super smooth. Parking spaces located right out front with specific reserved spot as well for ups store.Located in a beautiful strip mall with AJ'S fine foods, chipotle and clothing options like Jos A Bank.
