5	The staff is incredibly helpful and they know customer service. I will gladly go into Safeway (& go out of my way in general) to use this Wells Fargo as opposed to others. Joey is very professional and personable, as well as the rest of the employees.
5	I know I can't always expect good service from the big banks but this branch was fast, courteous and informative with a very complex banking situation. They even waived some fees to get money sent out.  Thanks
5	Very very friendly, happy to help, and fast service. Will make this location my go to.
5	Full service inside Safeway anything you need done they can do. Friendly service top notch.
5	I go here regularly as the hours are great, and the customer service is top notch. They not only remember my name (unbelievable for this day and age) but they are full service and answer the phone when I call and can handle any banking issue, or problem I have. They also will recommend products and services to give you the best experience that you may not have even considered before. Evening hours and Saturday hours and because of the staff here I won't go anywhere else.
5	I love this place thus far!! They have great customer service and remember who I am every single time. And that's because I hadn't been in for a very long time and yet they would ask my boyfriend whenever he would go in how I was... by my name! That nowadays is as rare as a unicorn lol!!! They've tooken care of previous issues I've had and have answered all my questions and if/when the banker couldn't answer a question they would seek advise from someone there who would've known or knows the answer. Over all I love it!! 2 thumbs up  if I had more I'd put more up ha
