1	Do not use this company, even if they quote you less than the others on the phone. They are dishonest, they lie and cheat you. The job is done poorly, they are slow and charge by the hour. I had all my belongings stuffed in things and turned upside down. The language barrier made it impossible to communicate my needs. They showed up unprepared, in spite of 2 phone calls to remind them of my needs. When they showed up on moving day, without boxes, I was told to "take a deep breath and go get my own boxes and paper and they would reimburse me." I found them very condescending.  In the end they refused to reimburse me. Tony (owner) talked about "that is just how it is in the transportation business." A 4 hour job took this company 9 hours to complete (did I mention they charge by the hour.) You would be better off just packing and moving yourself!
1	Worst moving company of the Valley ! Driver Mike dressed like a slob movers wearing pants with @ss hanging out.  Very unprofessional. Better off getting a few guys from Home Depot and a Uhaul.  Will definitely NEVER use this company again. Worst Service Ever ! I didn't even wanna give them 1 star. Mover BEWARE !
