5	Not Montreal's only cookbook and food lit specialty bookstore, but certainly its best.  A large collection of books in English and French (but mostly English) + a full-service kitchen makes Appetite for Books an ideal location for culinary book launches and cooking classes, and they don't hold back.  Check out their website for a complete list of upcoming events, and act fast if you see something you like--their series of events is very, very popular.
5	This is a bookstore that sells cookbooks and food-related literature, equipped with a modern, open-style kitchen towards the back. It's here that co-owner and gourmet chef Jonathan Cheung holds demonstrative dinners: he cooks a multi-course meal in front of ten people sitting around the marble counter surrounding the stove. He explains each step, ingredient, and technique as he goes, and ten strangers share a meal. Every menu is composed of recipes from a cookbook featured at the store, and you can bring your own wine.It's a cooking class in a bookstore - pretty original in my (cook)books.Jonathan was truly a great host/chef/teacher, food was great, and the whole event was a lot of fun. A class at Appetite for Books is a great gift!
4	Very inviting, open well-lit space, classes given , wide selection of cookbooks;if there is something you want but it's out of print, just ask the owner, Jonathan Cheung , and he'll see if he can get it for you online. I was looking for a book by the cake bible belter herself, that's been out of print for a number of years, & he got a mint condition copy for me, at a very good price. If you're a supercook or just a foodie, this  is the place.
