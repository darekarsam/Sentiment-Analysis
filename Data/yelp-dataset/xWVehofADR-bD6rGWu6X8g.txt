4	I've never been mini putting before so I had no clue what to expect but found this outting with friends quite enjoyable!It's very well located downtown, close to a lot of students, restaurants, bars etc. The place itself isn't very big, it's in the basement floor of the building right next to Phamarprix.Upon entering, you're going down these dark stairs that have splashes of neon paint all over. You're submerged in a glow-in-the-dark environment.There's a couple arcade type video games and two large tables and chairs to accommodate a group party.You can buy snacks, slushies, beer and other liquor.Price of admission was 12$ (10.50$ + tax), it's 8$ for kids. They also offer month long unlimited passes if you pay a bit more. You get a glow bracelet with a matching ball.The course has 18 holes, ranging in difficulty and takes about an hour depending on the size of group.We were 11 people and had to split into two groups to go through the course.There are black lights everywhere so any light colored clothing glows. It's pretty cool, I would definitely recommend this activity if you like mini putting or haven't tried it before. Just wish the downtown location was bigger.
4	I had a fun time at Putting Edge! I've never done it before but really enjoyed my experience. The course seemed a little short lived and moved along quite fast, but it was fun regardless. Cheap, glow in the dark, and an out-of-this-world feel, you will definitely be entertained!
3	It is exactly what it says it is - mini golf in the dark! If you like mini-golf then you'll love this! Good fun if you go with a group of people but I can't imagine going more than once.
