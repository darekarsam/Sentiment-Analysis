5	Great place for a cut. Fast, skilled barbers who pay attention to detail. Convenient downtown location. I was visiting from California and need a fresh cut. I couldn't be happier with the results.
5	Cool barbershop, the owner is a nice guy and does great cuts. The barbers make sure to give you the cut you want. Great price and service.
5	This is the barbershop to be in, has the NYC feel to it, with very skilled and entertaining barbers.
5	I arrived here straight from the airport suitcase and all, with a hair cut from hell that got the previous week at home in Edmonton.  Owner was present and I asked if he could fix my bad cut as I had a presentation in the morning to a large group and he smiled and got to work.  Precision cutting here - and he managed to give me a look that was sharp and met my needs.  I wish I lived in Montreal so I could go here all the time.  This place was moderately busy, got a vibe and they play some pretty cool music here.  Will be back when next in Montreal for sure.
