3	Montreal is no hotbed of Mexican restaurants, but there are a few decent spots and Cactus is one of them.  Go simple, enjoy the terrace and the drinks.
3	I went to dinner with 6 friends at Le Cactus and the overall score by everyone was 3*. Nobody complained about their food. Everything was consistently good (enough). I asked the question "would you go back?" and the answer was "ahhhhh... Maybe". This place is great in the summer. They have a nice terrace on St-Denis. With some sangria, guacamole and sun on your face the rating definitely rises to 4 stars easily.  I would recommend Cactus If you're dying for Mexican and you're standing on the corner, or any sunny summer day!!!
3	Really, quite average. The ceviche was enjoyable but the entrees left something to be desired. The mole, especially, seemed somewhat diluted, and lacked the focus which I typically associate with the dish.Service was optimal but quarters slightly cramped.
3	Good lunch spot - had the fajitas and sangria (delicious) for two. Reasonable price and great patio
5	Very good price to quality ratio. The food they offer is actually Mexican with legit ingredients. The pinas coladas are really good too.
