5	Pattie is a miracle worker. She helped me gain more confidence with just one session of hypnosis. She even gave me a recording on a CD to listen to whenever I felt the need. She is very understanding and made me feel comfortable. I definitely recommend her to anyone.
5	I seen Pattie just once for my smoking and I am happy I did. I am now Smoke free and never felt better. I had tried everything on the market.and nothing worked. I needed to quit for my health and I was happy to find out how easy it was with Pattie and her Hypnosis. I felt comfortable I didn't think I could be Hypnotized but afterwards I knew I was because I quit it's like I didn't smoke at all. Thanks Pattie! I recommend her Hypnotherapy for every thing.
