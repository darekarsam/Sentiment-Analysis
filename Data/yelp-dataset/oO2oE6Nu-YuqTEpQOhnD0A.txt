5	Best rates in town!  Trustworthy and Honest mechanic...hard to find in this day and age....but I found one!  If you need repairs or diagnostics done...do not go anywhere else until you call or go see Lorenzi's FIRST!

1	This dump is an absolute nightmare and Mike Lorenzi is thief. He gave me an estimate to fix my starter at $320 then called me up and said it needed a new pump and it would be an additional $493, when we came down to pick the car up he said he also replaced some sort of regulator and a belt and the bill was now $2,487 and said he couldn't get ahold of me and my wife authorized it. I paid it cause I needed the car to go to an important meeting right away and he was saying it had to be done and he saved me over $1,000 had I taken it somewhere else. Later I found out my wife didn't authorize it. After about a month I started having problems again and took it back and he said he was too busy to work on it so I took my car to another mechanic who said he didn't replace all that he said and the belt looked like it was taken off another vehicle. The mechanic felt he had ripped us off. We will be taking him to court.
