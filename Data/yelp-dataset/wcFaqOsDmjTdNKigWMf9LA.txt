5	The sale of my Dad's moon Valley home was a very emotional one for me.  Kelley made it an easy and smooth transition for myself and my family through such a difficult time in our lives. She always communicated with me and kept me up to date in what was going on. We sold the home in one of the worst markets Arizona Real Estate had seen and were still able to get a very fair value. Kelley's negotiation skills and experience helped us have a successful sale.  She was proactive in getting HOA issues for financing resolved and quickly resolved issues that came up with getting title transferred. I would highly recommend Kelley to anyone looking to sell a home. She is a true professional that gives personal service and you will know she is on your side.

5	It was a pleasure for me to find and work with Kelley; I felt she worked both for me and with me. She asked me all the right questions as we were looking at homes, and she definitely listened to me, so that as soon as she heard about the perfect home for me, she notified me, met me there and an offer was on its way almost immediately! I did buy the home, I love it and would definitely recommend Kelley to any buyer that is serious about finding their perfect place.
