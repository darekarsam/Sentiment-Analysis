3	Although there is a selection of chef coats and pants, the majority of this store is devoted to scrubs and other medical-field wear. Since I was looking for chef wear, I was limited to the left wall. Everything is arranged nicely - the top rack of jackets is divided by sleeve length, then colour, then size. The lower rack was filled with pants of every design and colour imaginable, I'm guessing organized by size but I didn't really look. Most of the items I looked at were priced about $7-$9 below average retail pricing (both retail and their prices are listed on the tag). I don't know what kind of discount the scrubs are at. There were also a few racks of scrubs on sale even more, some all the same colour, and some seemed to be a particular style. They have a few dressing rooms along the back, and a shoe selection. The staff was nice, though most of my interaction with them (after the welcome upon entering) was at the counter as they tried to add items on to my sale. No returns, only exchanges (if in unworn/sellable condition).. except for shoes, where there are no exchanges. (so take advantage of the dressing rooms!) Oh, and do yourself a favor and get lunch two doors down at Austin's!
2	I found the customer service here to be less than desirable. The lady was either having  bad day or was a real grouch. Seemed very annoyed in helping us. On top of that there are NO returns..even unworn and tags on . I would not go there again.
5	Great customer service and an awesome selection! The staff is very helpful and can special order anything you need. Great prices and super close to CMC-Main. I love coming to buy my scrubs here!!
