5	I am proud to give Dr Jones and the staff at Digestive Health Specialists their first Yelp review. I just can't believe they haven't had any other reviews yet. This office was FIVE STARS all the way! The front desk staff, the nurses, and Dr. Jones all made me feel at ease, answered all of my questions, were very understanding, and I couldn't be more pleased. I went in for a flexible sigmoidoscopy and a colonoscopy. Dr. Jones and the staff were a consummate professionals on each visit. I appreciated the preparation and post procedure phone calls. When I need another colonoscopy in five years I will be sure to come back to this office and I recommend you do the same!
5	After a very complete and professional appointment with Dr. Bradford Jones last week, I had an EGD procedure yesterday.  Dr. Jones was exemplary in his communication with me both before and after the procedure. His staff was also of the highest rating, extremely organized and personable.Coming from experience with other digestive facilities in Phoenix, Dr. Jones isoutstanding in patient-doctor relationship, medically and personal.  He is genuine and giving in his time and explanations, and feel fortunate to be a patient of his.
5	Dr Kozi is very respectful and skilled . Have used him a few times now and recommend him highly. The facilities are first class and the staff is very accommodating.
5	Dr jones is a compassionate and understanding professional, for months I was being told all of my symptoms were gastrointestinal, so after several gastroenterologist and pcps I went to him and he tested me for things well beyond gastro issues and while he did not find out what was going on, he at least did enough testing to find out it has nothing to do with my gastrointestinal system and that made me feel much better. I am still in search of what it could be, but at least I know what it is not because of him. Highly recommend!!!
