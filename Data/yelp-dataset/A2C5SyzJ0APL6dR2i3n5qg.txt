1	A lot of confusion during the entire transaction, things were not explained to me clearly. I asked several  times for closing cost amounts and didn't get the amount needed until  the day of closing and it was several thousand more then i was told, also they needed certified fnds at closing so this required me to make yet another trip to my bank and to Chicago title.
1	The escrow dept suborned perjury by the seller and defrauded me out of over $1000.  Never again!
1	this lady came and told me she was a New Yorker then was edgy and rude which I guess is normal for her then she rushed me, told me I couldn't use a piece of paper in the office and despite their I think they were getting 2500 dollars at least Then she commented how I was late and she had a2 p.m. Appointment, this on a house I was selling for $450,000 but apparently this was inconvenient for her, I have never called a company afterwards to try to get somebody fired but this lady was unbelievable and I will never go back to the company ever again because of thisher attitude was horrible and I literally had to tell her not to rush me and then she gave me attitude about which I gave her right back and then she finally shut up when she realized what she was dealing with. ... which is me putting her in her place... because I have never seen somebody like that and I actually hope she gets fired
