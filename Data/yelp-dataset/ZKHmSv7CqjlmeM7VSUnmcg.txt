1	Checking out the previous reviews, I feel I may have significantly missed out by ordering online and having the food delivered to my home.  Given, though, that this was my experience, I'll share it, nonetheless, and just urge you to try it in person if you're going to bother.My partner (an immigrant from Mexico) and I tried the quesadilla, nachos, tortilla soup, and french fries (which were a substitute for elote / corn because the restaurant had run out of corn).The quesadilla was unexciting.  It was a flour tortilla with cheese stuffed inside and melted.  The tortilla soup, my fiance says, tasted like chicken noodle soup with crushed tortillas in it.  The fries were soggy at best, and the nachos were an atrocity.  It appeared as though they opened a bag of tortilla chips, threw on scoops of beans, avocado, and canned nacho cheese sauce, and left it alone.By the time the food arrived, what was once hot was cold, what was once firm was soggy.It may be because I adore Mexican food... it may be because I had it delivered instead of going into the restaurant... or it may actually be something wrong with the restaurant.  I can't say for sure based upon one experience... I can just say my one experience hasn't left me excited to try it a second time around.
