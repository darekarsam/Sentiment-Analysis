5	This shop is great. They have a good selection of products. The staff is very friendly. They are very knowledgable  about their products. I went in to look for a road bike and they spent over an hour with me explaining what to look for and how to fit the bike to me without ever trying to sell a bike to me. I will buy my bike from them when I decide which one I want. They have an optometrist in the shop for sport optics and a big selection of frames. They repair and sell bikes, clothing, shoes and helmets and have a nice section of accessories. Buy your next bike here.
5	Pretty phenomenal shop.  Rolled into town for vacation and the tsa had jacked up a brake by opening and  repacking improperly. They were super immediate on the fixes and also gave us some great local trail advice.  All the guys were super nice and helpful.
