5	Special thanks to Keith at Rats Towing (and the service center at Glenn Jones Ford in Casa Grande)!!!My wife and I were participating in the Mustangs Across America 50th Drive #maa50thdrive, when my 1988 Ford Mustang 5.0L Coupe died on outskirts of Casa Grande.  I did my best to trouble-shoot it on roadside, but ultimately had to call for a tow and more advanced diagnostic help.  I want to give special recognition to Keith for his timely response and tow to the Ford dealership).  Turns out my ignition coil had fried itself along with my ignition box.    I cannot say enough good things about their customer service and responsiveness.  We caught up with the rest of the Mustangs in Las Cruces by nightfall thanks to their heroic service from Rats Towing and Glenn Jones Ford service center.https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=688108017919618&set=o.146159948872212&type=1
5	Needed a tow truck to pull out our delivery truck that was stuck in mud.  I called Rats and they were very helpful.  They got out to the site in 15 minutes and took care of the truck.  They were very professional and extremely fair.  I would highly recommend them.
5	Had car trouble near Casa Grande when traveling to Tucson. Needed to have my car hauled back to the Buick Dealer in Tucson.   Called Rats Towing about 8 a.m. Within 20 minutes, Tom showed up and loaded the car on to a flatbed truck.  Could not have been more pleased with the service in getting the car to Tucson.  Price getting the car to Tucson was very reasonable.  I highly recommend Rat Towing if you need help.
