4	Happy to see they put a Chick-Fil-A in this area!!! Went through the drive-through for a quick lunch pick me up, little hectic in the ordering as they just opened 2 days ago but I'll be back!
2	This location may want to just stick to lunch and dinner.  I ordered something on the breakfast menu and they made me pull around to the front and wait for 10+ minutes to get it.  So not so fast-fast food...which is way worse in the morning when you're trying to get into work on time.  The Raintree location has their sh*t together and gets you thru in a more timely fashion.
5	Great service, happy associates - warm and friendly.  Excellent service!  The managers took time to talk with the customers and worked to build their team up!  Way cool to see
1	Horrible drive thru and slowest service. I have tried to give them chances but it never gets better. Last week was the final straw. I was behind one car and no one was inside and it took forever.
