4	This was the first stop on our visit to Montreal. We were staying in the Plateau area, dropped off our bags and walked on Mont Royal. Saturday afternoon around 2pm and we could still grab brunch! Here's what we had: Savory crepe with spinach and gruyere served with mixed greens; veggie omelette with potatoes and fruit on the side. The crepe was so delicious! Best one on the trip! The omelette had a great mix of veggies and tasted pretty good. Waitress was very friendly. Overall, good experience.
2	Nous nous sommes assis, il nous a fallu attendre 20 minutes pour avoir le menu (et les verres d'eau) et 45 minutes pour recevoir nos plats... Le prix est raisonnable mais la bouffe vraiment sans plus... Sans parler du service, aucune organisation... Je n'y retournerais pas c'est sur...
4	I just happened to land on this place one day when trying to find a place to eat brunch when everything was closed (it was a holiday of some sort). What a nice little spot to land on. I was very pleased with the service and food. My boyfriend and I now go her regularly!
