1	Comcast always overcharges, provides poor service, and their customer service is inexcusable. I had a two year contract, was misled on the level of service, and was not told by the salesperson that the charges would go up after one year. When the contract expired, the charges again went up, this time by about 25%. Every time I've ordered pay per view, with a room full of friends, there has been an issue that required that I call their call center. And whenever I had an issue with service, or had a question regarding one of their indiscernible bills and had to call their customer service line, I've been transferred nonsensically or just hung up on. Comcast  has been allowed to provide their services at a monopoly for too long.
1	DO NOT USE COMCAST XFINITY SERVICES. Worst service, ever. Horrible experience on the phone with them. They took a payment off my credit card and applied it to someone else's account and then said mine would be delinquent because 'they don't have a payment from ME'. The rep said I would have to dispute the charge with my bank but that doesn't have anything to do with them. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO TOOK THE PAYMENT. When I said I'd cancel service he said, "if we don't have anything else to talk about then I guess this conversation is redundant." Smh.
1	Comcast has the most HORRIBLE service I've ever had to deal with...they are complete scam artists I wish I could cancel everything I have w them but unfortunately they scammed me into a three yr contract without my knowledge because I moved....horrible people they ALWAYS overcharge me...AND anytime I have a problem w my service it's RIDICULOUS to try to get thru to someone who can help you...constantly transferred or hung up on....I can't stand dealing with COMCAST absolutely worthless...if I could give them zero stars...it's would be too many...
