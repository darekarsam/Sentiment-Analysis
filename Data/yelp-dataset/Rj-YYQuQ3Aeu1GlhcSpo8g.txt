5	Bought my engagement ring here. The sales woman was very polite and a true professional. She kept me within my budget and helped us find a beautiful ring. Also the application for credit was quick and discreet. I definitely would make another big purchase here.
2	I love the Helzberg Store at the San Tan mall, it seems like San Tan hires..... younger employees... I have been to this Chandler store 3 times to browse and look for wedding rings. They always seem to have a not so pleasant attitude. When your in the jewelry business you need to find a happy medium between giving your opinion and listening to what the customer wants.
1	They are supposed to have a trade in policy.  You can trade in your old jewelry and get full credit for what you payed as long as the new jewelry is over double in cost, or at least that was the sales pitch.  When we tried going in and asking about trading in a ring purchased there, all of a sudden the "deal" started getting really complicated.  First, the customer "service" lady said each trade in is at the manager's option and she didn't think he would be interested in my ring.  Second, even if he was interested I would only get what the manager deemed fair and only on a full priced item, no sales or special buys.  I feel lied to and grossly mislead.   I am sorry I ever bought anything here and never will again.
