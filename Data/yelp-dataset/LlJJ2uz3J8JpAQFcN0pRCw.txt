5	Kula Yoga & Wellness is a wonderful yoga studio. They are so friendly, their prices are reasonable, their instructors are top notch & they have a large variety of classes from beginner to advanced. If you want to sweat, they have a class for that, you want meditation, they have a class for that. It's awesome! I hightly recommend Kula to anyone interested in getting healthy & fit!
