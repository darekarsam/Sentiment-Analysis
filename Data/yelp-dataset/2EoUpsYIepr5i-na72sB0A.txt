5	I would like to appreciate Mr. Chris Long from Box Brothers Las Vegas. He was very nice, courteous and helpful.
5	July 2014Moving is a very stressful thing and most people don't have any recommendations as their experiences are usually not good.  I on the other hand recently helped my son relocate from Las Vegas to a small town in Washington State and had a great stress free experience with Box Brothers. We had a very short amount of time to pack and get him moved.  Box Brothers was most accommodating .  I was able to contact them and have them pick my son's things up the very next day.  They were able to wrap and arrange shipping for 1400 pounds of his belongings including furniture, glass top desk and boxes which contained fragile items and get then to Washington within 4 days.  Everything arrived as promised and nothing was damaged.  The movers on the other end who helped us unpack said they had never seen things packed so well.All other moving companies that I contacted couldn't promise delivery for 14 days and were far more expensive. I would highly recommend Box Brothers and will use them in the future for all my shipping needs. Call and ask for Chris or Brandy Long and I assure you they will take great care of you!
5	Big thanks! I have been a Box Brothers customer for years. Great service here at the Dean Martin store. Give em a try! Quick. Reasonable. Careful. Mark D. Las Vegas NV
