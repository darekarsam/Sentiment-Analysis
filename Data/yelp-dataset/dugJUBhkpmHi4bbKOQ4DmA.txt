5	This Starbucks knows what they are doing! I Just ordered my first pumpkin spice chai of the season and it was amazing! Kimmy provided excellent customer service as always and I will definitely be a regular at the store!  This is a new Starbucks and business tends to fluctuate so check the line before you commit to the drive-thru if you're in a hurry.  You may need to go inside for faster service!
4	I am definitely a Starbucks girl! I love this new Starbucks because it is in the way to my church and it has the drive thru option! The baristas are super friendly and always get my order right. Only thing I don't like is that I have to go out of my way to get in and out of their parking lot. Other than that, it's my new favorite Starbucks!
2	This particular Starbucks is having difficulty managing how busy they are. Please HQ send a specialist to help with the looooong wait times. I've been at busier Starbucks before and they do a better job. The staff here is under trained and not your typical happy Starbucks employees. Disappointed for now.
5	This Starbucks has it going on! The staff was so nice and very fast! I ordered a secret menu Butterbeer and they made it perfect! We really needed a Starbucks in this area! I am so glad we got all these friendly people to go with it. This location was even doing a community craft night tonight. Who does that? I love it! Keep doing what you do!!
1	I frequent Starbucks at least once every day. This particular Starbucks is closest to my home. When possible I prefer to support the businesses in my own community. For some reason they seem to always screw up my drink. I get either a pumpkin spice latte soy cinnamon dolce latte soy or a Java chip frappe  soy. No extra modifications but nevertheless I need to get someone else's drink, some drink that doesn't taste at all like any of the drinks that I've ordered or there some odd object in my drink. I have decided to just stay away from this store
