2	Prices are as follows 1 8x10 = $16.002 8x1= $25.002 5x7=$16.004 5x7=$25.00Any way you get the picture, (no pun intended) this company goes to your childs school and take their pictures.  You have no obligation to buy anything how ever if you want to keep memories of your childs per-k school pics then you will buy it. I ordered a 8x10 with a specific back ground and the name and year, it was hilarious not only did they mess up my order the only thing they did to rectify was offer a free 8x10 that I already didn't like. CCSD you need to find another company for photography.
1	Some how for the second time this year they seem to have missed my children's pictures. They see the my child is dressed for picture yet they don't bother to ask a 5 year if they have the form. Then if you order online it doesn't say bring form so I didn't bring it. And guess what no picture was taken. Not very considerate at all. I even asked if I can go somewhere else to get the pictures taken. No she goes to explain what a mess it was in the past when they did for someone else. Well needless to say my kids will not take pictures with them ever again. I will take them to a studio from here on.Customer Service -None, you got to find you a better person. Had to call cause clearly they were avoiding me. Then all the sudden she finds it while one the phone with me. Next...
2	Prices have changed a bit since Vanessa P's 2013 posting.1 8x10 = $10.002 5x7 = $10.00Seems each sheet (regardless of the portrait size) has been reduced to $10.00Regardless, I believe the pictures are still expensive.  It would be 'considerate' if some savings were passed on to the parents since Bartolo is reaping studio prices for bulk services.  Package prices and extra prints are comparable to Sears/JC Penny or the other professional photographers located in the Mall.  (At least the other photographers provide a variety of poses).
