3	Really surprised there have been no reviews about this location. It is been around forever. You can get all of the things you need to get done at a bank from here but it is an old location and looks the part.they've got bulletproof glass separating the tellers from the lobby... Sure if there have been problems here before. The tellers seem friendly but I rarely actually go to the bank anymore. Got to love online banking and direct deposits :)
2	If you don't mind feeling like the place is going to get robbed any moment it's not too bad:-/ the staff are nice but very slow.
1	This is the worst,, slowest and no customer service. they are there not to satisfy customers. They need someone with a brain at this bank., I would fire all the employees at this branch..
3	I give it 3 stars because a- i used the atm outside and didn't get to experience the bulletproof teller windows inside b- there were no robberies while I was there.
2	Teller Isaac was outstanding, polite, always inform me what he is going to do before he left the counter to get me things, always have a natural caring smile and warm voice, and did extra effort to help me in multiple ways. However, someone he called to help me, a woman name Jessenia, was awful: it took her forever to come out talk to me, while there was no client with her; then she speaks very fast and in in-complete sentences, her attitude was very impatient and irritable (while she obviously doesn't know too much beside what she was told to say about online/ app banking). She was so rude, I had to just choose to leave there because she was unpleasant and unhelpful. I will be happy just call the number teller Issac wrote down for me before she came! I really think she shouldn't be in the customer service position. Worst BoA experience. But the teller was good, like other helpful tellers in other branches. This is the First time and Last visit of this branch for sure. There are another BoA just 5 min away on Sahara and they are always great!
