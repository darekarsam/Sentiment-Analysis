5	Erica with a "C" did an awesome job cutting my hair and making me feel like a welcomed, valued guest.
5	After several bad hair experiences around town,  I walked in and Melissa absolutely saved me!  They are so friendly and helpful and excellent hair designers!  All of the stylists have been there for a long time and they are like a family which of course made me feel very comfortable.  I will continue to have my hair beautifully done with Melissa!  You guys rock!!
4	I just went in today to get a haircut. The lady that took care of me did a wonderful job and I would recommend anybody to go in there
