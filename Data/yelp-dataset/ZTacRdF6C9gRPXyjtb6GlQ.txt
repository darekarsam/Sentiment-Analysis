4	The is one of the best Supercuts I've been to. Brittani is great and really listens to what you want. I cannot speak for the others as she's the only one that cuts my hair, but everyone seems to walk out with what they want.
5	I have been coming here for 5 years and will not go anywhere else. The staff is fun and professional and you will leave smiling. Jennifer does an awesome job, she is my go to, but I have had most of the staff cut my hair and they are great. Keep up the good work.
