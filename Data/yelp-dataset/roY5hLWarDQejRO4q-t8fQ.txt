1	Absolutely terrible communication, very inconsistent.  Turned my pool green 3 times and each time I reported it, they never sent anyone out, I had to take care of it myself.  They have one technician that did a good job, but overall, it was a horrible experience.  Never gave me a quote to fix anything even though they mentioned a few things may not be working.  Would never recommend this company to anyone.
3	I'm writing this from my repaired phone in 20 minutes. These guys are awesome! If you own any Apple products, have these guys on speed dial!
