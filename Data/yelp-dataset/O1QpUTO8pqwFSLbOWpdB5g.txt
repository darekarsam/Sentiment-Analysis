5	I brought my 2007 Nordic Trailer into RTW after a blown tire caused damage to the fender and needed repair and paint. I also requested a tune-up and inspection due to the fact that the trailer was just purchased. Neil Rucker, his brother and his team did an outstanding job and were very helpful the price was very reasonable and they did everything with the boat on the Trailer. I absolutely recommend them for help with your trailer!
5	5 stars for sure! Neil was very, very helpful. Neil must have answered 20 emails when I had questions about what work needed to be done. I felt like I was always treated like a customer and a friend at the same time. They don't even try to mark up the prices on the parts that you need, I checked all over the Internet and could only find an extra couple of dollars which wasn't worth ordering myself. The job was done well and right on time. They even let me have my boat/trailer towed to their lot after business hours.I would highly recommend to anyone who needs trailer repair or has a need for a custom built trailer to check these guys out. To me, honesty is key and you will be sure to find a lot of honesty with RTW. I will be a customer to RTW for as long as I have a trailer and you can count on that!
5	Another great experience with my Nordic Boat Trailer. These guys do great work!
