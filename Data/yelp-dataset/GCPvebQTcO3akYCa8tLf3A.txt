2	Decently priced sushi, however the quality is so-so. The restaurant is really dark, so I am not inclined to eat there.
3	The sushi here is cheap and good quality for what you pay.I've never eaten in - the place itself looks pretty iffy and dark - but I've gotten home delivery quite a few times, and always been happy with it. Delivery has always been prompt, and I've never had any problem with the quality. It usually costs about $30 all up for my girlfriend and I to eat well.If you want the best sushi in Verdun, then you want Aka-Fuji down the road.If you want a cheap and healthy meal delivered to your door, it's SUSHI TIME!
3	I like this place. It's okay. The rice is really good and the fish is fresh. The main problem here is customer service. Don't get me wrong, they are nice people and they try to please their customers. However, they often made mistakes in my order. There is always something wrong or something missing. Recently, I specified I did not want avocados and somehow 50% of my order is filled with avocado. If you eat sushis from this place, make sure they understood what you wanted and check your order before leaving.
3	Just ordered from sushi time! It was really fast, got here in no time. The sushi is not the best sushi I ever had, but for the price it's a-ok.
2	A generic bland sushi like so many in this continent. They are pretty cheap so no harm done if you just need to fill your hunger
