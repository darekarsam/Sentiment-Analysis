4	Dr Bernard is excellent. He goes over everything with you in detail and basically walks you through the process. There's usually a day or two for consultations and paperwork but when that's out of the way, they get to work and your visits are quick. He seems very knowledgeable in his field. He is also quite a chatterbox. His staff of nurses are friendly, smiley and won't hesitate to help you with what ever you need. This location is also known as the "Midtown" location.
