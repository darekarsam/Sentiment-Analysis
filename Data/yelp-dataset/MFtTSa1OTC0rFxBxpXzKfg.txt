3	It's pizza, and my family prefers Pizza Company over the big chains, and other local places. We used to order from the Potomac location, since they delivered to our address, but since they've closed, the Library Rd. store is our go to shop. The wings, and breadsticks have been given a thumbs up by the kids. Pizza has been consistent, whether we're ordering a cheese pizza, or something with extra toppings like pepperoni, or Italian sausage. Service is friendly, food is good, the only drawback is having to drive Rt. 88.
2	Remember that saying, that sex is like pizza - even when it's so-so, it's good? That pretty much sums it up. There's nothing appallingly wrong with the Pizza Co. pizza. It's just kind of ho-hum. With that said, I enjoyed the chili poppers a lot. (Which were inexplicably wrapped with the ranch sauce for delivery. Mmmmm....hot, sweaty ranch dressing.)The delivery guy was really friendly. Delivery time was unimpressive. A full 45 minutes mid-afternoon, and I live two blocks away? That's what I get for being lazy, probably. Karmic pizza. Prices are pretty good though, so that's a bonus. They may end up being my 'Dangit, I've only got fifteen bucks!' joint. Otherwise, probably not.
4	I wasn't crazy about the Untouchable since I don't like Primanti's sandwiches, but the pizza was more than decent. Unfortunately, they don't deliver to us, so we had to go there to get it.
4	New location in Rostraver! Great wings! Take out wings are usually soggy orOver cooked...not these! Cajun and buffalo are Amazing!
