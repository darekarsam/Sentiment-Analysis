2	I was so frustrated with this place after I got my eyebrows done. I told the lady at least 5 times that I don't want to change the shape of my eyebrows but to simply trim and clean around it. I even stopped her half way just to remind her not to make it any thinner, and sure enough she did ! My eyebrows looked so thin afterwards and when I confronted her about it she had the audacity to tell me, "thinner is better." I was so pissed off. I paid and walked away! Avoid...
2	I go here because it's closer to me and more convenient than other Shapes Brow Bars. You really have to get a good person and stick with her because others will mess your brows up. I like Nohara, Zena and Sandy. My brows never end up looking too thin with them, and I have learned (the hard way) not to stray or let anyone else look at, let alone touch my eyebrows. The wait time is horrid, and usually only 1 or 2 people working, while 10+ people wait, and the customers they are working on are threading entire face. If you don't mind the wait (grab a pretzel and drink) go to one of the three ladies mentioned above and have beautiful brows. Three stars taken off for long wait times, few employees working on weekends and lack of speedy service.
5	I've never had my eyebrows or lip threaded before this visit. My technician was excellent and tamed my unruly brow and upperlip in no time. No wait time on a Tuesday afternoon (my off day). Very fair pricing. I will definitely return.
