5	We had Mr.Handy re-tile a shower and bath and install an all glass door. We were slightly short on tile. Jason was able to come up with an alternate pattern that made the room look perfect.
5	I have lived in my new home here in Las Vegas, and Jason came to review everything on my wish list.  He was very patient and knowledgeable about the projects I wanted to do.  He helped me organize my wish list, and he began painting 2 days later.  He was very neat and finished painting in a timely manner.  He is so experienced and every project he started, he finished with a wonderful outcome.  From painting to hanging ceiling fans, building shelving and a counter in my kitchen, trimming out door ways.  He has helped me make my home a comfortable and inviting home.  Both Jason and his office manager Nicole have become friends of mine.  I thank them both for their expertise and professionalism.  Thank you Jason and Nicole.
5	I was very happy I chose Mr. Handyman for the work on my house. I was a little apprehensive having someone I didn't know how his work was. I am beyond satisfied with the work Jay did for us. We asked him to hang two ceiling fans and retile our bathtub. I was surprised when he had done a great job plus he recocked our whole bathroom without charging extra. I didn't expect him to do that. The job was fantastic.  My family and I love using the bathroom. I recommend Jay to everyone I talk to. If you want a professional and courteous experience than call Mr. Handyman.
