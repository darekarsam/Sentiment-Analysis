5	Awesome pizza & wings! Great specials and great prices.
3	They have great pizza and wings. My only complaint with this restaurant is you can order wings medium one time and their great, the next time there really weak, and than you get the medium that's too hot to eat. They need consistency in their wing sauce!
1	If customer service issues are important to you, you will leave this establishment alone.  I called to file complaint to manager at the Surprise location only to be called a FUCKING BITCH.  Wow, I still cant believe this happened.  He not only called me this once but 2 times before hanging up on me.  apparently he didn't like me complaining.   Their staff has always been very unprofessional at this location, but never did I think that the manager here would behave like this.  My advise to you is give you business to some one who appreciates it.
5	I ate here for the first time a month ago. To bad I don't live in the area because I would be a regular. The pizza was by far one of the best pizza's I have had EVER. I took advantage of the lunch special and boy was I impressed. For $5.00 you get a personal size pizza and soda with unlimited toppings. I don't eat pork but I loaded my pizza with sauce and veggies. I ate that bad boy like it was my last meal. This is one pizza I can say was finger licking good. It is a small establishment that is built for to go orders. No place to sit for dining. They have a few other items besides pizza but trust me you need to try this Pizza it is amazing. My friends ordered other items such as a sandwich, wings and churro which they all thought was delicious. The woman who took our order was very patient and kind. When I am on that side of town I will be back to grab some food to go.
