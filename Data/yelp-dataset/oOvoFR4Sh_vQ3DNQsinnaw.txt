4	Primitive, what happened to you? Downsizing, that's what happened I'm sad to say. So far, Primitive has been to go-to spot for buying records because I'm vintage like that. I love their slightly psychedelic decor, just groovy! Unfortunately I'm not sure much is left of it since they only occupy half the space they used to be in. As I remember it, their reggae selection used to be huge, much to my disappointment being more of a rock/metal fan. Keep your eyes peeled and you may find an incredible piece (my personal high was digging up the very first Cure demo, for what, $7?)maybe even in it's original plastic wrap!
4	Yeah, this is a sad one.  Primitive used to be an important part of my constellation of Montreal record stores, but now, having downsized drastically, I'm not sure how much longer that'll be the case.  They've always been strong when it comes to sixties pop and rock, both Anglo and Franco, and I've found many, many amazing finds in their "new arrivals" bins over the years.  Tasteful selection of vinyl reissues.
1	Not sure, I would really count this as a review, but more of a simple FYI. If your thinking of heading here don't. This place has closed. :(
