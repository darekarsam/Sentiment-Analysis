4	Spent a good part of the afternoon strolling the palace grounds.We went here on a Monday in November, which was a mistake as the museum is closed on Monday.  However, that didn't stop us from taking advantage of the grounds and parks surrounding it.The grounds are well kept and expansive.  Since it was already winter, the many fountains and water were not flowing, but that did not deter us from enjoying them.  There is a really nice playground for every age of child hidden among the many paths.Even if you don't make it inside the palace, spending time strolling through the parks is worth the visit.
