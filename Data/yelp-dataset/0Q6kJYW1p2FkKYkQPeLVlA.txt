4	Forget floral and the new nude, the best thing about River Island this season is their new line Antique with Attitude. What this boils down to is a collection of fab patterned cardis, white tees with bold black and white prints, grey and black jumpers, beautiful wide leg trousers and stylish cream macs. For the truly brave and stupidly skinny, they also have leather hot pants that conjure images of Marianne Faithful in Girl on A Motorcycle. Oh and there's matching black and grey suede boots - with and without heels. That's my autumn wardrobe sorted then!
1	THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER RECEIVED I am appalled at the level of customer service received both in store and over the phone by River Island. I have been a valued customer for many years, but no longer. The manager in the Edinburgh Gyle Store spoke to me like something she had trodden in and customer service were not in the least bit interested in my complaint. I was humiliated and disgusted that a manager could speak to a member of the public like this and in the words of the customer service complaints department 'Its your word against hers'.But thanks for bringing it to our attention...I emailed the CEO direct as I couldn't believe the response, only for the email to be forward onto the complaints team, who emailed me to repeat the same thanks for bringing it to our attention...Complete waste of time, I cannot believe over the years I have spent so much money in a store who treat their customers like this
