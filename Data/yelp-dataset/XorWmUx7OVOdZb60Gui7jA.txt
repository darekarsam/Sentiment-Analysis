5	Perfect coffee.  Super friendly service.  I don't know anyone in the city of Montreal, but when we walked away from this cafe, my 6-year-old son said, "Now you have a friend in Montreal, Mom".
5	So I walk into this corner coffee shop next door to Fairmount Bagels and the classic "dammit-I-wish-I-knew-about-this-place-before-I-went-back-home" thought punished my brain all the way back to NYC.Why? Because I just stopped in with my wife and 3-year old son for what was easily the best cup of coffee in Montreal...and was treated like the best family in the world. All that, plus being teased by watching the owner's wife making the day's hero and panini specials from scratch...damn I should've copped a hero for the road.They even gave my son a bag of candies as they thanked us for stopping by. Another reason for this Bronx-born-and-raised dude to call Montreal my second home. We shall return soon and so should you..especially if you're fortunate to call this culinary mecca home.
1	Worst service ever! The coffee's no good, always over cooked, hell burned!
4	I went to Fairmount Bagel for the first time and didn't know they didn't sell coffee. So I took my bagel, got a coffee and sat in a bench on the sidewalk. Excellent coffee. Be warned that if you get an Americano, it will be scalding hot, but good. The owner is a character, but very friendly if you take the time to be friendly too.
5	Great place for coffee! Found it because I purchased a bagel at Fairmount Bagels and they do not have their own seating or other breakfast items like coffee. Very happy to discover great coffee nearby. The owner immediately strikes up a conversation and even recommended some places to visit in Montreal. This place deserves your business.
5	Great espresso, salads and paninis. Nat, the owner, treats you like family.
4	This review is for the Barista! Thank you for making me a proper double americano! It was fab!
