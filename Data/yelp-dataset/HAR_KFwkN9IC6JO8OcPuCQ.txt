5	I can't say I've tried a lot of Fish & Chips in Montreal, but I see no reason to look any further. Nice portions, good variety. Fish & Chips as it should be done.
3	You get what you pay for. I had the popcorn shrimp,could of been better. The batter just slips right off and the shrimp itself was almost raw. I'd give this place another chance but def not for shrimp. Maybe cod or salmon?
5	Fantastic Fish and Chips! Fresh and crispy and served with one of the best tartar sauces I have ever had. For those who love a traditional chippy this place is not to be missed.
