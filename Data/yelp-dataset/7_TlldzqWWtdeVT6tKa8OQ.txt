4	PINK! PINK! PINK! FLAMINGO!There is so much pink inside the Flamingo - this bar especially! The downstairs area at FLAMINGO opens to the strip; I don't think It even has doors! People walking by can view the gambling tables and go-go dancers above them.  Also near this part of the hotel is Bugsy's Bar. The cute bar has seating all around it's circular shape.We've stopped at the Flamingo before and met friends for drinks here. They're comped if you're gambling on the machines (minimume $5 must be in the machine). I usually stick to Blackjack and can walk away without spending very much and a cold drink in hand! A well drink will cost you $7.50 (plus tax = $8.11) if you're not gambling. There are buy one-get one coupons for casino bars that can be found at various spots in the hotel. So hopefully you have two friends hands if you're paying full price.After going for a run on the strip one of the mornings we were there, I made it back to our hotel and stopped here for a glass of ice water. I stopped at a second bar before making it to the room. It was hot out! Glad water's free!
3	Take a seat at this super long circular bar that anchors the front entrance area off The Strip and drink for free while playing some video poker. Flat screens all around with the night's ball games always on. Good spot to people watch. Really nice bartenders here.Kick back and watch the working girls make frequent sweeps of the area to hit up on their next venereal disease victims! No glove, no love! Put a helmet on it soldier! Or pay the price!
4	How can anyone not drop by here for a drink, named after the guy who started it all?Ok, it was also bc unlike most of other drinking joints at other casinos, this one is a lot easier to get to, without walking through a haze: it's located right on the casino floor amongst the slot machines and table games.Got a cool, rectangular table bar seating.  yes, it does feel old and antiquated, but that's the style ;)
