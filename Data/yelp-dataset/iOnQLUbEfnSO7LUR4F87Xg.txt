5	I just recently got a puppy (through some interesting circumstances that I mention in my review of Lucky Puppy).  A&E was one of the first vets we took him to when trying to find out why he wasn't walking properly.  Since then, my girlfriend and I decided to continue going to A&E, in part because we found their staff to be generally caring and helpful.  They gave us lots of great advice in how to care for our "special needs" puppy and were very honest about everything.  They also took it upon themselves to help us in more concrete ways with our dog Tonka's care.While I'm sure there are other wonderful vets in the area, I can't imagine going anywhere other than A&E after the help they've given us.  Thanks guys!
5	I've been taking pets here for several years after a bad experience with another vet. These vets do not require unnecessary tests on every visit, don't act like you hate your pet if you don't want to spend endless money on tests and such (my last vet wanted me to spend $1800 to run a test to MAYBE DIAGNOSE - not TREAT - my elderly cat). They are caring, realistic and competent. It took me a long time to find a vet I liked and I will definitely stick with and continue to recommend this place.My only suggestion is that they learn to treat chickens. Urbana allows chickens and it would be very nice to be able to take my girls there as well.
