5	Best place in the world to get your nerd on. Games, competitions, tons of geeks, and lots of booze. The social engineer in me loved being one of the only chicks here, but the practical Vanilla felt a little eye-balled, especially since there was a reporter who was thrown out of the conference who resembled me (because she was a girl, and I'm a girl, and at the conference girls are few and far between). If you go to this conference, you'll not only walk away feeling smarter, but more superior to everyone you meet for about a week. Plus, you can learn a lot of neat-o computer tricks.
5	Each year Defcon gets better and better.  This year I attended all three days and learned so much I thought my head was going to explode.  The funny thing was that for some reason there wasn't enough hours in the day to do all of the stuff that I wanted to do.  If you are into computers, security, etc I highly recommend checking out Defcon 17 next year.  www.defcon.org
5	So very crowded this year. I guess the word's out, or more smart people made $1k to blow in hotel rooms and plane tickets, because there are lines everywhere for all the talks... Still fun, but maybe a larger venue and more talk opportunities to spread the crowd a little thin? xoxo u defcon!
5	When I first came to defcon I realized that yelp requires a certain character count for reviews to be included as something more than a tip. In my surprised stupor I decided to write more words in the form fields such that I might write a review that indicates that I'm a Serious Yelper. Here it is guys, this is my well thought out and carefully edited yelp review of defcon. Get out there. Go hack things. Blah.
