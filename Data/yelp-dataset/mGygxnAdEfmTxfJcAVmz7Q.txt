2	You can usually identify the quality of a Pizza by its tomato base. The Italian Connection (of which I'm sure food passionate Italians would insist there isn't) slaps its sugary, mass produced, artificial tomato base on all its pizzas.  This ultimately taints all the pizzas they serve. Saying that, the pizzas are cheap and I often see people inside on a regular basis. Let me know if I'm missing something.
3	The only connection they have is to the Italian Section in Asda. This place is disappointing... But that doesn't stop hundreds of people visiting every time I pass, I've never seen the place empty. I don't know whats doing on. For me, I'm with Sam, the pizza tastes very manufactured, it's got no heart (which is strange as hell to say) I'm giving this a 3 star, because I realise this a popular place. Might not be for me.
1	again as other reviews very disappointing. It doesn't look great from the outside but i thought i would give it a go with my son who fancied a burger. The food isn't the worst i've tasted but the staff are so slap dash they're not really geared up for people sitting in. They seem to focus on take away's and seemed to have alot of delivery orders but still we had to wait 10 minutes to get some cutlery. I don't think we will be going back!
4	We had a great experience here with a delivery to cure yet another seasonal hangover. We went for a veg pizza, a few sides and some juice. Standard prices for such items and delivery was quick.The pizza we received was piping hot and looked the part. Everyone enjoyed what they had and for a take away this was a good effort. The sides were better than your average pizza place.  All in it wasn't our culinary highlight of the Christmas period, but for what it is, it was great. Thumbs up from me and I will definitely be back.
