3	Not the hugest selection, buy 3 saves you a dollar or 1.50, which isn't a spectacular deal.   Nice staff, cute store.  Really limited on men's socks.
4	Soxx Shop at the airport. Best selection and most styles of Smart Wool socks; over the knee, knee high and even Smart Wool tights. Also bought my first pair of spanx tights and they are reversible!!! Just lovely. Now why aren't you in Philadelphia? or Cherry Hill Mall in New Jersey?
4	Small specialty boutique that as the name states sells socks.  They also have a limited selection hosiery.  Prices are a bit high average cost for a pair of socks is around $10  They have plain solid colored socks, striped socks, knee high socks, and socks with have print, pattern, and design imaginable.  I picked up a pair of socks with French Bulldogs on them for myself, and a pair with cats on them as a gift.  I do miss the days when they had a wider selection of hose, tights, and stockings.
