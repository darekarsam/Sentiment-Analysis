4	Very friendly.  I have stopped in once for a cup of coffee.  The smell inside was amazing.  They cook one lunch a day and on this day it was stew, and if it weren't 95 degrees out on this particular day I would have had a bowl.They also have pastries that I have never heard of before.  I asked about the one and it is some type of doughnut, they gave me a free sample and now I'm scared that I'm going to get fat because it was so delicious and I have to walk by this place two or three mornings a week.
4	Read a post gazette review and decided to try this little place for lunch.  I understand the owner is Kenyan and I'm by no means an expert, but I thought it was quite tasty.  Had the Tilapia came with rice and a side -- it was an insanely huge lunch for like $7.   I was just sad they were out of samosas when I got there.  I really hope this place does well.  The lunch options around that part of downtown get boring FAST and this is a nice addition.
5	Awesome little place, that I stumbled into by accident. Lydia is cooking a different meal every day if you fancy more than a coffee or a home made snack. She and her husband are really friendly and the espresso is great!
5	I had the Friday meal. It was tilapia, beans, something else, and rice. It was delicious. I haven't had any of the other meals, but I plan to soon. The beans and the other side were spicy, but not too spicy. It was $8.50 plus tax I believe.
5	Lydiah's Coffee House is the best place in Pittsburgh for a cup of coffee...Great atmosphere by owner Lydiah and the best Somoas's in Pittsburgh.   The Lunches are hearty and you never leave work or her shop  hungry!
4	Great addition to downtown!  Every Monday, she has traditional Kenyan food- like curried goat and the mush-like side that accompanies.  the curry spaghetti is nothing special, but the ribs are amazing.  Lydiah is friendly and eager to answer questions. A little pricy but worth a try.
