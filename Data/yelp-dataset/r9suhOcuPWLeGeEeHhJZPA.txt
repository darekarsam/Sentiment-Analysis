5	Wow!I have to say that Fabulous Foods really impressed me with the service, professional demeanor and especially the food when I attended two events that they catered.The Yelp.com CMYE at Desert Botanical Gardens was my first experience with Fab Food.  I was pleasantly surprised again and again with the quality of the apps being brought around at this event.  Bacon wrapped figs...yum. Several kinds of brushetta...yum. The marinated shrimp was delicious. Everything they brought out was delicious!Service was really friendly and professional. Everyone I spoke with was informative about what they were serving and pleasant to chat with as well.After the Yelp.com CMYE I went on to the beergarden event at the DBG.  This was catered as well by Fabulous Foods. Again, pleasant and agreeable staff and service.If I need an event catered, Fabulous Foods will be the first call I make!
1	Arizona Science Center  deserves better.  The " Cafe" doesn't serve coffee or tea.  What a silly joke if it weren't so sad!  People need to TRUST that no one business is going to unilaterally change the definition of the word, "CAFE" to not include a hot cup of coffee or tea.  False advertising
