4	Though Gamestops are aplenty in Charlotte, this location did a great job. I came in to sell an old Xbox that I wasn't using anymore. The manager was fantastic to work with. He busted out everything, tested it and gave me all of the trade-in value on one simple card. I was shocked! I didn't remember this being such an easy exchange. So happy to be in and out in about 10 minutes! He wasn't pushy at all. Very cordial and wanted to know more about my interests and not going straight for the sales jugular. Not much of a gamer, but this place is a Mecca for all things gaming. Not only can you find everything you need from systems, games and all of the necessary hardware, but these carry other gadgetry now as well. Apparently, they started buying and selling iPods and only iPhones, too! Pretty snazzy. If I have any video game needs, though not likely, or need to pick up a video game/present for 10 year old's birthday, this is the first place I'm heading. Cheers!
5	These guys know there stuff, great advise, not just looking to sell more, but really educate you on the options.  Highly recommend this be your first and only stop when game, console or add on shopping !
5	I don't know how they do it, as I'm not even a gamer, but every time I go in there, I get swept up in the enthusiasm of the many sales persons in the store, and buy twice as much as I plan to. Is this a good thing? I suppose! They are great about recommending games based on previous purchases and also including helpful tips about the games (including rating details). I know there are many to choose from in town, but this particular Gamestop is my "home store". Love it.
