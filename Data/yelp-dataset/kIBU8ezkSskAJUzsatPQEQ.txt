5	Daniel did a great job on our volunteer shirts for an upcoming tech conference this week! He not only beat out every other screen printer in price but delivered the shirts fast and they look EXCELLENT! I highly recommend him!
5	Daniel came through on a last minute project ahead of schedule and saved the day!   He took the time to offer the best customer service (from the first point of contact) until the end.  Even though they were obviously slammed, I felt that I was the only customer.  Thanks a bunch!  TS
5	These guys were very friendly and helpful, and the shirts turned out great. You probably won't find a better option for screen printing in Charlotte.
5	Daniel is great!  He was able to make me 1 shirt for my daughter in 1 day.   I so appreciate the quick service.  Next time I need a shirt or many shirts,  I'll be back to Curiosi-T!
