5	Super friendly staff, innovative locking mechanism that takes a noticeable effort to break this deterring break-ins and clean very very CLEAN.Only a small annoyance but the keypads for the gate is inconveniently too far to the left causing you to either drive REALLY close to it or get out of your vehicle. Small trade for everything else.
5	I've had a storage unit at this location going on 2 years now.  Cleanest facility I have ever seen.  I have a 10x10 and it's about 110 per month with insurance.  Nice people at the desk and seems secure.  Not looking to pack up any time soon.  Recommended if you are in that area.
5	My experience was awesome here . I was unaware of how storage units work and Phyllis guided me in the right direction . Her and her partner showed me the unit options and explained everything very clear and very professional . They are legitimately the best in the business I believe . And they will even let you use their 10x10 truck for free to move in .i will be back  for sure . Thanks guys !!! :)
