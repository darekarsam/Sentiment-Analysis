4	I love this place, whenever I'm in town I make sure I drop by Peter's Cape Cod. The price is right and the food is great. I love seafood and this place delivers what I crave. This is the place to be in the summer time, they have a nice terrace and great service. If you visit Sainte-Anne-De-Bellevue you have to visit Peter's Cape Cod. I recommend the shark steak, delectable!
1	While visiting my in laws we decided to meet friends at Peter's big mistake that day.  While the patio and al fresco dining is great the service that day was awful and my fish the Mahi Mahi was undercooked.  The waitress did not check on our table and waited 15 minutes until she brought the childrens meals.  Imagine 6 hungry children waiting that long for food.  She forgot our appetizers.  The manager was nice and comped my fish.  I though the other meals were good, the fried sole and fish nuggets for the kids.  I would not recommend this place unless it was a nice day and you only wanted a beer or wine outside which overlooks the river.
2	The place has been around for ages and has a good reputation among locals. I have been twice, though, and was underwhelmed both times. I found my meals fairly bland. The service was reasonable. The best thing about the place is the location, on the water. If you sit indoors, the atmosphere is nice, with typical seafood theme.
