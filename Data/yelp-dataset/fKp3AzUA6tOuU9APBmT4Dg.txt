4	Really like this place.  Fixed my machine quickly.  Has good stock of thread, sewing machine supplies and new and used sewing machines.  Friendly atmosphere and very helpful.  They have some good classes also.  Would highly recommend!
5	I drove across town today to Cynthia's because my Janome machine needed servicing.  I had been putting it off because I was expecting a one week turn around time for its cleaning and small repair but when I walked in, the friendly service fella' said it was not a big job and he could fix it right away while I waited.  Now my machine looks brand new and is back in tip-top shape and I did not have to be away from my machine for more than 10 minutes.  Fabulous!  I will for sure come back!!  I may even have to return for the serger I was eyeballing while I waited!
