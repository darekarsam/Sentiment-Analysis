5	Totally new experience now happening at this location! French bread and pastries flown in fresh from France. Coffee house extraordinaire so worth the drive.
3	I want to love The Coffee Shop. I really do. I am a fan of independently owned coffee shops, and with this being on Water Street in old Henderson, it's close to home. My biggest issue with The Coffee Shop would have to be the operating hours. Opening on weekdays at 8 am means there is no chance of me stopping in here for a cup of caffeinated goodness before work. Closing weekdays at 2 pm means there is no opportunity to swing by after work either. And with The Coffee Shop being closed on Sundays, that means Saturdays are the only days I can get coffee here.Allison S. and I stopped in on a Saturday hoping to get a little breakfast and some caffeine before starting a day of shopping. The food menu was limited to sandwiches, salads and some crepes, so we inquired about other breakfast offerings. The man working, who I believe is the owner, suggested a souffle which sounded excellent so we each decided to get that as well as a drink.Food is made to order at The Coffee House, which we were warned about when we ordered, so there was a short wait for our breakfast. There was a musician playing the guitar and singing both covers and original songs for us to enjoy as we waited. Our drinks came out rather quickly, mine was one of the daily specials and it was excellent.  I wish I could say that the food was as good as the drinks. I don't eat a lot of souffles, but I am pretty sure that they are not supposed to be quite as runny as the ones we were served were. I'd love to return to The Coffee Shop for more caffeinated drinks, but unfortunately due to the hours it may be a while before I get a chance to do so.
