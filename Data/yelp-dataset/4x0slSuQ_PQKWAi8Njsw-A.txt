1	Do not use this facility. I have worn contacts and glasses for more than 50 years and this was the worst experience. I needed trifocals and computer glasses...both were a disaster and had to be remade. My "regular" glasses are horrible and am wearing an old pair which are much better. I called to let them know I was having problems on several occasions and they never returned my calls. The staff is rude and very busy chatting with each other. When I last saw them, I had a cataract that needed the attention of the ophthalmologist but they do not refer you to anyone. They down-played the severity and my vision kept getting worse and worse. Went to see Dr. Fisch and he said the cataract was severe and that surgery was required. I was treated as a valued client at his facility and will never go to Nationwide again.
4	I went last year and this year and it was Dr. Shifrin that dealt with me.  I felt the staff was pretty professional and handled me well.  I think my first time I was a little late so I was there what seemed like forever, but they did a thorough job with making sure my eyes were healthy.This time, since I was on time, I was in and out of there in a little over an hour and it was really painless.  Everyone treated me well and Dr. Shifrin just said I really need to get better glasses and he was helped me with making a better choice with providing me different options for this.
1	Made an appointment for 10 am. Did not see a doctor for over 2 hours. Waiting room is dirty and has no magazines or toys for kids. Women working at the desk are less than polite. The place is just a nightmare, not to mention they blame it all on the new tech. Not the way to do business.
