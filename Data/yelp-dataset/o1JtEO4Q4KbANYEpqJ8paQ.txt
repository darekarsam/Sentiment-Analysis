4	This location is in the Epicentre and I always receive specialty service whenever I have to visit which is not very often and I've had my share of horror stories about my carrier but thankfully I've only experienced great service.  They actually came very close to talking me out of my beloved iphone for the galaxy, but I escaped safely with iphone in hand.....nice try AT&T.
5	I was very close to dropping my AT&T service because of the lack of customer service... I was getting so many mixed rules on my plan from other locations that I was just downright frustrated. We talked to an awesome lady named Ashleigh at this location and she fixed our plan, told us the ins and outs of our minutes etc. We ask a ton of questions and she was more than willing to listen and explain each one in detail to us. We went to this location to purchase our new upgraded phone despite there being a closer location to us, just because she was a great help. Whenever we need anything this is the location we will always go to. :)
5	This is probably the best AT&T store in Charlotte. The service is top notch when needed, but more importantly they hang back when you tell them to back off. The manager of this location personally took care of an issue created by another AT&T location with a smile. I recommend just talking to the service people here, even if you do not need a new phone!
