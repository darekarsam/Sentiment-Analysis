1	Wow. If you want to buy something here, be prepared to be assaulted if you don't want add-ons. I can't believe the change of attitude in our salesman when we said we didn't need cables, and did not want their warranty. The "sales manager" came over, (who was younger than the salesperson--I'm not buying the "manager" thing) and tried to sell us also. We left without buying anything. When they mention Monster Cable, RUN!
