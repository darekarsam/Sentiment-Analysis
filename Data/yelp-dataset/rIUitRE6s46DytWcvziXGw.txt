5	As a Real Estate Agent I work with client move outs all the time and have never experienced such friendly, professional and AFFORDABLE responsiveness like I did with Cliff at Certified Specialists.  It was last minute, client was already stressed, tired and thought he could do it all himself.  Needless to say Cliff fit him in asap, did a professional job and gave him a great deal too! It's nice to be able to work with and support companies who's priority is customer service and great business overall.  I will definitely not only recommend him to others but will use him myself very soon!
5	We've used Cliff for our carpet cleaning in 2 different houses.  Always a great experience!
5	Amazing prices, friendly, and does a phenomenal job.  My couch and floors have never looked so good.
5	So impressed with their work! My carpets have never been so clean. They are so professional and work with my busy schedule. I highly recommend their services and will continue to use them in the future.
5	Cliff was prompt and professional.  His prices were very reasonable.  I never thought my grout could be this clean again!  I had other companies quote me 2x what his rates were.  I will use Certified specialists again and would definitely recommend them to friends and family!  Thanks Cliff!
