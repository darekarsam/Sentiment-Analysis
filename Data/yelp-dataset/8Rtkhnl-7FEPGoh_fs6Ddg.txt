5	Loving how fabulous our carpets look and FEEL!!!My husband has been remarking all evening about how efficient and thorough the guys were. The estimate was more then reasonable, based on the level of service, efficiency and thoroughness the techs (one of whom is actually the owner!?) provided. PV Interiors continually exceeds our expectations regarding our carpet and tile needs!!
1	I called this company based on reviews I saw on Angie's List.  When I called I think I talked to a "Sharon" we started off ok and then things went south rapidly!!  I tried to explain to her that this property to look at was in escrow and that there was a lock box on the door which the realtor would give her the code to so she could gain access. Easy enough or so I thought.  She suddenly acted very put out and started quoting prices without even looking at the flooring -not to mention she couldn't  see the property for two weeks!!  Her blatant lack of enthusiasm and overall "sour attitude" led me to quickly end the conversation and move on..Maybe she was tired clearly she did not want or need my business...
5	Love PV Interiors! Excellent work, professional friendly staff at competitive prices..
