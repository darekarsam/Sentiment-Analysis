5	It was delicious and authentic!  I had the Com bi cha thit nuong - and it was perfect!  My food-fussy fiance loved his dish - chicken and rice (it's always chicken and rice!)   I can't wait to return to Montreal for some Vietnamese food!  Bon Appetit!
1	Not impressed at all!  Had very basic Viet dishes and they were completely lame, frozen vegetables in stir fry, iceberg lettuce was the most exotic fresh vegetable I saw. I am a Montreal visitor, I know there is good Vietnamese food here. This is not it!
