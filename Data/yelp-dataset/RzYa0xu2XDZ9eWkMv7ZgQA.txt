5	03/23/12 REPAIR.I had a GROUPON for a simple single rock repair. Took it over there, no appointment, they had me done in less than 30 minutes! Really nice repairman, people working the office, etc. If I ever have a need for more extensive body or glass repair, I'll go there!
5	There is a crack in my windshield! So I needed to call my insurance company.  I have glass coverage so I wanted to see who they recommend.   Auto Glass Authority was the top of their list.  They were able to replace my windshield the next day.  Yay! Ken S. arrived in the time frame we set up.  He was very thorough and professional.  Within an hour my car was pretty again.  I would highly recommend using this company.  Everything went smoothly!
5	Great service! Tech Kris was very personable and knows his stuff! Explained the process and care very well!I highly recommend them!
5	I called Auto Glass Authority on a Saturday and they were able to come to my house on the following Monday. I called a couple other mobile glass places before them and nobody else could come out as soon. So installer Kris came out and he was awesome! Very informative and personable. He explained everything he was going to do and he did it in half the time other places would've taken! It took him an hour to remove my old windshield and install a new one. Would definitely recommend and will use them again in the future. Also their prices are very competitive. They aren't the cheapest but they are one of the best. I went the cheap route and I got burned. So I decided to pay more for quality and that's what you get with Auto Glass Authority.
