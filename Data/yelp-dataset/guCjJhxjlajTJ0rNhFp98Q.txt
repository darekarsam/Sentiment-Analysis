5	I was recommended this place by my cousin who simply adores this restaurant and is a regular so I went to visit and asked where we should go eat, she was very fast at answering Bistro Chez Roger! We walked to the restaurant so I am not sure about parking. We sat at the bar which looks like a dinner enjoying the chef at work. I was very impressed with the decor and lighting, it felt very warm and yet "Branche". If you know me or read my reviews, you already know that I always sit at the bar so I was very excited to find the long diner type bar. We ordered the fish, the shortribs and ribs. I got to taste all 3 meals and they were all very delicious. The fish was flaky and well seasoned, the short ribs couldn't have been more tender and the ribs were simply falling off the bones. The service was awesome, our server was very keen and giving us great recommendation. We all know that bad service can ruin the night, it was not the case, it's was the opposite.I was very pleased with this recommendation of this place and can't wait to go back and try more food!
2	Well... Decor is neat, food is decent, the price is right and I guess ignorant service is part of the deal.Service is not terrible, but forgotten stuff, cluelessness of our waiter, her fake, robotic smiles and overall slowness and mix-ups were very annoying.The real question: can we expect better service at this price? And my answer is: probably not, but...My advice to the boss: simplify you menu, educate your staff, stop pretending that you're higher-end than you really are and everything will feel much smoother for us, your customers.
