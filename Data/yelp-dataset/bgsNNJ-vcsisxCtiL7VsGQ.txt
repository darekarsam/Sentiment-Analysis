5	This has always been a great store to go to for all of my cell phone needs. My wife's phone had messed up, and the manager was able to offer us an upgrade with the EDGE program and to lower my overall monthly bill without a renewal of my contract. Great customer support and these people are not amateurs. Military friendly!

1	Since going to this location, we discovered we were ripped off and completely lied to. Do NOT go to this store!! Talk about dishonest!!
