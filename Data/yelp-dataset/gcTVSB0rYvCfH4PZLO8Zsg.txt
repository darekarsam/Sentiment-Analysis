5	A great dentist for the kiddies.  They don't mind going to see Dr. Ramsey, and have never had a bad experience even after sealants, cavity work, and anesthesia, along with routine cleanings.  He is a gentle man, and the staff is very friendly and professional.  The office is fun place for the kids to play and divert their attention prior to the exam and treatment.  The kids will stay with this practice until adulthood.
5	We've been going here for my soon to be six year old son since he was two. He's been cursed with bad genetics in his teeth so we've had cleanings, fillings, kids root canal and x rays here.  Dr Ramsey and his team are caring and gentle, the wait time is very little as well. They have plenty of toys in the waiting room just in case. To have your child sedated for dental work is scary but they are a great office and take good care of my son- I wasn't so worried!
5	We love Dr. Ramsey and his team! My son had a tooth pulled yesterday an he was really nervous but they made it so easy and painless for him. My boys love going to see Dr. Ramsey and have no fear of the dentist like a lot of their friends and it is all because of the staff at Dr. Ramsey's office! Thank you so much for making my kids dentist experience enjoyable!!
