4	Great Maggie Moo's location.  The owner has been present on both visits to the shop and she is very nice and makes sure you have a good experience.Although they are the same concept as Coldstone, to me, I much prefer the ice cream at Maggie Moo's.  It's less sweet and allows the flavor of the toppings to stand out a little more.A visit to Maggie Moo's is not cheap though.  For our family of four we shelled out close to $16 and three of us had the kids size portions.
5	Butter pecan ice cream, strawberries, & brownies is my fav just like a cold stones, but not as crowed
5	I'd give this place five stars for the ownership alone.  What a wonderful couple that understands how to keep their customers.The ice cream here is really good!  For those of you watching your figure while letting the kids have at it...try the low-fat frozen yogurt (the lemon cream is good).  The pumpkin ice cream tastes surprisingly like real pumpkin...not the fake flavor of pumpkin.The decor is bright and whimsical...perfect for the kids.Try:  The cotton candy ice cream (I know...but really...try it)Avoid:  Counting Calories
5	Wonderful ice cream! New favorite place for ice cream.
4	Great place to spend a spring day. The managers were so much fun and made great recommendations. I had the Better Batter Cake Carnival. Pure deliciousness.
5	Best ice cream in the Charlotte area.  The employees are always so friendly and fast.  We go their almost weekly.
5	We went to Maggie Moo's for the first time yesterday and it was awesome! The girl who was working the counter was really pleasant and seemed happy to be there, which is a plus! We all loved our choices! Even though Fort Mills is a bit if a distance from us, we plan on adding Maggie Moo's to our "must go again" list!
