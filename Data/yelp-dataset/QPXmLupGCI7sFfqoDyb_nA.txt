4	I had to rent a trailer to move some odds and ends. the staff was friedly and very helpful. I forgot my receiver so they let me use one at no charge and evey let me use a tail light adapter instead of making me buy one. great staff.
5	awesome customer service! Every staff person I have come in contact with is nice and very pleasant. They are also generous and caring! THe manager Gary is very nice and I really appreciated that they let me use a refrigerator dolly for free!
4	I've used this location numerous times and each time, have had a great experience. I had a hitch installed on my mini SUV and they did it perfectly, killer warranty, and very pleasant people.  I've since rented a number of trailers from them and each time, it's quick and efficient, in and out (I use the on-line site to pre-book and it saves a ton of time.)
4	Everybody was friendly. I was in and out FAST with my rental truck. The young man at the counter even suggested I keep it overnight rather than rushing back with it to get there that evening. Drop off was even quicker. I would definitely return.
