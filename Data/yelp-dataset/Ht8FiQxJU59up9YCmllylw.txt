4	Nice clean new Goodwill just opened in Goodyear on McDowell and Pebble Creek parkway.  The lines went smooth. They are always stocking. I noticed that there were a lot of employees keeping stuff neat and organized. Hopefully this continues.
4	Very clean and well organized. This location is smaller than the more larger Goodwill's but they seemed to have a little of everything. The furniture and housewares section is small but come here if you are looking for clothing, they have a large selection.
1	I recently bought 3 board games from this store. They were taped shut so I just asked the cashier if I could open them to make sure all of the pieces were included. She assured me that they check all of the games before selling them. Shame on me for trusting her! I live 3 hours away, so when I found out they were all missing so many pieces that they aren't even playable, I called the manager. She did not apologize once, and told me all of her employees are new so it's not their fault! She refused to do anything to help me. I am so disappointed with Goodwill!
