5	Dishes are not salty but flavourful, and unlike many other chinese restos, you don't have to drink litres of water after dining here. Weekend special spicy beef soup stole my heart. Even simple steamed rice is good because they use jasmine rice and cook right (well anyone hates flavourless rice cooked with too much water? That's a turnoff.)
