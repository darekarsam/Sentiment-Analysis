2	Somethings changed here. Management used to be excelent. Went in today just for an Oil change 19.99 imediately they added to the price for the filter. Never had that happen here before. We asked for fluid top off. Yet another charge. The Manager came back with an estimate of $800.00 (tires, alignment, brakes) WHOA!!!! We just put tires on not even a month ago. No problems with allignment or brakes except we needed a little fluid.  We declined and went to Auto Zone and wont be back. Another lady who was handicapped had to walk all the way across the parkinglot to go get her car and the Elderly man next to us was in for over $2000.00 charge for repairs that were not done and was told that they were still trying to fix the problem and this was for the time they took to find the problem. Pretty pathetic and we will stick with our 2nd oilchange spot. We wont be back. What a shame. The old crew was honest. We were Loyal meineke customers 3 1/2 yrs. Too bad they have truely lost our confidence and trust.
