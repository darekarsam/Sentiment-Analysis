5	I try to go horseback riding at least once or twice a year. It's especially fun when we have people visiting from out of town. The OK Corral has by far the best and most interesting chaperoned rides I've experienced in Arizona. I've been a few other places but they honestly don't compare. The cowboys here are sassy, which is how cowboys are supposed to be right? Ok, maybe sassy isn't exactly the right word but you know what I mean.  They know their stuff about the horses and the area and they're authentic. If I could ride every day with them I would and every time I leave I find myself contemplating abandoning my city girl life for cowgirl life. Seriously.
5	Super fun horseback ride! We only scheduled an hour ride as none of the four of us that went had been on horses before. Next time (we will for sure be back) we will do a longer ride. Our tour guide cowboy was really nice and knew a ton about everything.
5	Very professional, great horses, great scenery, it was lovely. Amazing prices too! The OK Corral is the place to go for trail riding. Plus - there are real cowboys, who would have thought? Went for an hour, will definitely come back for more fun!
