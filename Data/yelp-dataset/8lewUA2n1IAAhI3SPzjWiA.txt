4	R&R Kelly's is located way down Fish Hatchery Rd on the outskirts of the West side. I happen to live over there so it's not much of a drive for me, but if it would be for you, it's worth it.They have great food in a unique and pseudo-Irish style. The dining room is very minimalist but comfortable. They have 3 or 4 private booths that are my favorite.Huge bar and a great staff.
3	Grade: CWhen this place figures out what it's supposed to be, it might be okay.
