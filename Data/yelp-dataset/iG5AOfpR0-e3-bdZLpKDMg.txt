4	My friend Rob from McGill U. said: "Of course we can get to Mont Royal Parc, follow me, it's a really short walk this way." That little short walk turned into a 2 hour trek through 160,000+ tombstones, 3 religious denominations, a crematorium (creepy), 100 ft. in elevation change and some gorgeously quiet scenery...in fact, I would venture to say it was dead quiet. But c'mon!!! Two hours? This is a lesson for all of you. When a guy friend says trust me, it's this way, don't unless you want to get somewhere the long way! Well worth a visit...although you might want to do so on a bicycle.
5	A beautiful cemetery with a suitably Victorian vibe (Edward Gorey fans take note) that doubles as an arboretum.  Great place to enjoy the Mountain away from the throngs.
5	A beautiful Urban Cemetery equal to any in it's class.  I loved the personal nature of many of the tombstones.  Many told the story of a life worth living.  We even got to watch Shakespeare in the Park on evening.   And don't forget to stop by the office and buy their beautiful pictorial and historic book.
5	I'm trying to find were my grandpapa is buried and a lady called Christina at Mount Royal cemetery was kind enough to email me back to England and  tell me his not resting there also gave me la link ...she was so lovely so the staff are caring and lovely and they connect with people..after viewing Mount Royal pictures and contact with Christina I'd love to be placed there as Canada is were I need to be when I pass.Again thankyou Christina for being so kind
