5	Great pizza and wing and the staff is great
1	Awful undercooked.  Got the runs from one piece.  Paid $22 for large crappy pizza that got me sick.
5	under new management - simply delicious
2	Had the choice between the pizza here or a $5 dollar one from a chain, decided to give Palermos a try. Wrong choice! The price to quality ratio was just completely off. You really do not get what you're paying for, but hey the kids loved it so what the hell. Will try it again, but will not stray away too far from the pizza. The first thing that I noticed was that the pizza was very greasy. Greasy pizza, which is no problem if combined with pizza that has flavor, but the flavor here was completely lacking and greasy pizza without the flavor is no good. I kept eating just to see if it would improve. It did not. Like I said, I will try it again, so don't take my word for it. Try it for yourself.
5	Really good pizza and wing specials.very affordable.cheezy tasty pizza.appetizers good and not expensive.if your a beer drinker they make the best michelada this side of the border.highly recommended.great for family and kids
