1	I hate that airport make everything so much more expensive. Ordered two spicy sandwiches and some chillicheese fries. Got charged 22 dollars. I was so confused until I noticed they gave me a more expensive burger. We ate them anyway because we were starving. The chili cheese had absolutely no cheese. And they burger was meh and mostly lettuce. No refils. SO expensive. Stupid airport making everything so expensive.
2	I understand that being inside an airport, prices are inflated for the convenience, but you should at least get food with similar quality you'd get from the other locations.  The Famous Star burger I received from these guys was a joke!  It's like they just nuked the whole burger including the veggies. So what I unwrapped was this dry overcooked patty dripping with warm mayo and ketchup with soggy wet veggies.  C'mon, now!  For the record, I have been here before and ordered a Breakfast Burger and that one turned out okay.  Apparently they don't know how properly stack veggies in their burgers here, so if you do decide to come here, stick to ordering any sandwich that doesn't have veggies, and you''ll be okay.
4	I'm not really a fan of burgers or fast food, but I'd never had a Carl's Jr before so I though I would check it out. I was surprised at how tasty this was. I went for a Texan burger, it was pretty big and filled me up for the rest of the day!
