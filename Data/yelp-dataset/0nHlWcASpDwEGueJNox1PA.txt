4	Brad is the best barber ever. He has a nice beard.
5	It took me 10 years to find the right barbershop in this town.  My instructions to my barber was, "cut my hair".  He did a professional job.
1	This place is stupid. There are only 4 chairs, they dont take appointments, spend an hour + on every haircut (partly because they take breaks to make dumb jokes), they only take cash, and they are only open for about 5 hours a day. Their entire business model is based around seeing as few clients as possible. I used to get cut from them months ago because the wait wasn't that long and it was so cheap... but if you were to walk in now, the wait could be up to 2 hours. In fact, it WILL be 2 hours. It depresses me when i walk into this barber shop and i see a gang of 15 people sadly sacrificing their entire day just to get the opportunity to get a mediocre haircut. Cant someone else open up a half decent barbershop in this town? WTF? And why dont people in this town have anything better to do than sit on the floor in a stinky barbershop and listen to dudes talk about burritos? I would recommend this barbershop to anyone that is jobless and likes to hang out in a place that resembles a refugee camp.
5	Best barbershop I have been to in a long time!! The wait is well worth the results. I just happened to be lucky enough to stumble upon this gem of a place and I am very happy I did! The staff is friendly and all seemed equally talented as I got to watch several people ahead of me get cut.Do yourself a favor and check it out!
