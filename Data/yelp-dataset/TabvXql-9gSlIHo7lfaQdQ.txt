5	Alati is a long way from my home but the cannoli?  I would walk if need be.  They are tastes of perfection.  I've tried cannoli from elsewhere, even a few homemade but nothing compares to Alati's.  I do thank the universe, in its wisdom, for this patisserie being so far from my home otherwise?  I would weigh in at a metric ton.
5	My family has been going here since it opened because they are second to none.  The cannoli are easily the best in Montreal.  The shell is always nice and crunchy and the ricotta filling is out of this world.  Everyone I ever introduced to this place falls in love with it.  The chocolate ricotta cake is another favourite.  Their pizzas are also really good.  It's a great place to grab lunch at when you're in the neighbourhood.  Just note that it is cash only so make sure you have enough on you when you go.
3	I just happened to walk into this place to get a quick bite and was pleasantly surprised. This bakery is apparently known to have one of the best cannoli's in the area but I decided on having a prosciutto, arugula and parmegianno sandwich and it was FANTASTIC! a bit over priced but every bite was better than the last. I even bought a 2nd sandwich just to bring home
5	We were driving by trying to find a bakery and came across this one. So far it is the highlight of our trip! The desserts all look scrumptiously delicious. The gal recommended a few items, even gave us a sample cannoli! Just the cannoli itself is worth stopping into this place... Mmm m mm!
5	Probably the best bakery outside of Italy!! I am from ny and always in montreal and this place is my first stop when I come to montreal. Better then all the bakery shops in nyc period.
