5	I needed to lose 15 pounds to get ready for my reunion...Jon-Michael made the diet easy and I  learned a lot.  The workouts were short and focused and he got me in touch with my breathing in a way that taught me a lot.  I found him to have a vast knowledge of what I needed to improve my lifestyle and reach my goal.  I lost 18 pounds and fit my dress.
5	I lost 42 pounds in 12 weeks working with Jon-Michael.  As I continue I lost  a total of 50 pounds and continue to get stronger and feel better. Jon-Mike is not like all the other trainers out there.   He learns you as a person and uses what you think are the most basic exercises to slowly work your body till it wants to loose fat and gain muscle.  I will never forget my 1st hour session with him he had me totally broken down in 40 mins then discussed with me all my food options and what I was doing wrong.  I learned more in one day than I did in my last 40 plus years
5	I've learned how to lift properly and I'm stronger than I've ever been.
