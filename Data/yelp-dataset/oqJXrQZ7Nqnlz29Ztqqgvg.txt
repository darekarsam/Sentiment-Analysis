1	Have a tattoo that is so faded and not dark or clear. A real waste of time and money. Won't go back. People were nice but quality of tattoo was awful.
1	Got a piercing here and it is obvious to me that they have close to no knowledge of what they're doing. Had to have my piercing taken out that was very painful by the way, because the piercer who looked no older than 18 did it wrong. Have to have it redone. She even recommended to me a product that you're never supposed to use on a piercing. Unprofessional. Don't get piercings here!
