5	Best service ever! I'm switching my prescriptions over right away. The staff is knowledge, friendly, experience, and they will work to get you the lowest price they can (without you having to ask, might I add). I'm recommending this pharmacy to everyone!
5	I feel weird reviewing a pharmacy,  but the service here prompted me to do so. I met one of the pharmacy tech's elsewhere and she clued me into this little gem. The location is nearly 30 minutes from my house and Dr's offices, yet I am going to continue to come back.The fill time is super fast, like 5-10 minutes, they remember your name and welcome you as you walk in the door, the Pharmacist always offers you a bottled water and you know they did everything in their power to get you the best price possible.
5	My doctor refereed me for a compounded prescription.  Aside from the drug, I am still amazed at the wonderful, personal, knowledgeable service here.  Worthwhile switching from CVS or Walgreens to here just to be treated right.
