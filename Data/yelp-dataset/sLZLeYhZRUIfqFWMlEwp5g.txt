4	This could potentially be my neighborhood bar!  A 15 minute walk from my place.  Came here on a Saturday night with the bf.  The place was pretty dead, so we were able to sit on the couches.  Ordered a couple of beers, the grilled chicken salad and the margherita pizza.  The grilled chicken salad was eh...I could make better, but the pizza was delicious!  They used fresh mozzarella and didn't use tomato sauce (how a margherita should be!).  We ordered the medium and had leftover slices.  Food and beer were decently priced.  They have a pool table and the venue is fairly big and divey.  Can't wait to take a stroll to Chris's Place again!
4	A friendly neighborhood bar.  They pour good drinks.  the food from tha cafe is very good with large portions.
1	What kind of bar shushes patrons who are spending their hard earned cash in their crap hole? THIS ONE!! Oh, and Village Pub. You can't say the F word, says Dave and Phil (really stand up guys, I'm so sure!!). But it's ok if you dump your life savings into their video poker machines while they watch and drool over you hoping you saved some for them, for doing pretty much nothing. This city is so contradictory and bartenders represent that to a T. I'm sure Phil acts like a perfect gentleman when he's at PTs drunk off his ass. Fuuuuuckin A!!
