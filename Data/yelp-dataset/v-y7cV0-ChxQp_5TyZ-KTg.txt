3	Briefly: Beer: excellent. 5 stars Service: efficient and quick even when slammed. 4 stars Reuben sandwich: meh. 2 stars Coleslaw: yuck. 1 star Beer: excellent. Repeat. Not many choices in Terminal B for adult beverages. If you want one, stop here. If you want food, go elsewhere.
3	07/31/10Sis and I stopped here for a snack before parting ways homeward-bound.  We had bid goodbyes earlier, as we were taking different flights, but found some extra time to reunite for a cocktail.  In the end, I decided to skip the cocktails (at $9 a pop, served in an old-fashioned cocktail glass, I thought it a bit pricey), but after having a couple sips of her Grey Goose and tonic, served w/ a lime wedge, I almost wished I'd had one myself!  We decided to share a small bowl of chili since neither of us felt particularly hungry after all the great food we had in the few days we spent in WV!  I was actually surprised at how tasty this pre-packaged and re-heated chili was!  This bar is so far removed from other dining establishments in the terminal that, if I were to find myself in the same wing in the future, I might be tempted to try a couple of spoonfuls of it again.  More likely, though, I'd just order a cocktail.
1	Just ordered a chicken breast sandwich at Samuel Adams in the Pittsburgh airport.  They served me flavored pressed chicken paste made to look like a grilled chicken breast.  Could not eat even one bite.  They did not charge me even though I offered to pay.   My reaction to their chicken paste must be fairly common.
