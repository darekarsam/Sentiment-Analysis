5	Located in a tiny but elegant and comfortable office in the Monogram Salon Suites professional office condo, AZ Laser Image doesn't only specialize in hair removal, that's *all* they do. Don't expect a full-range spa treatment with a massage & pedicure, 'cause that's not what they're about. I'd never had laser hair removal done before, so I did plenty of web research about the type of laser they use (the Candela GentleLase) to know what I was getting into. Once at the office, Floreen prompted me to ask many questions and answered them thoroughly, putting my mind at ease. She states that she's been doing this since 2003. She put my favorite channel on the big plasma TV and got to work when I was ready on the comfortable bed. The treatment was painless! Floreen often asked how I was doing. It didn't take very long either. I left the office with instructions on how to take care of the treatment area, and an invitation to call if there were any more questions or concerns. Today is the day after, and so far there have been no side effects on the treatment area whatsoever.Laser hair removal requires 4-6 treatments, about a month apart, so there is no way to tell at this time how successful this will be. If it works the price will definitely be right, as this was by far the lowest price I've seen on laser hair removal. I'll be following up...

When we complained that we had no success at all, they wanted us to pay more money for four additional sessions.  I think they purposely use low voltage so you keep paying and paying.  I may as well burnt my money in a fire. It seems it may be ok for botox but not hair removal. How sad when that is there name,
