5	Excellent quick service and best real chicken anywhere. Nuggets to die for with no grease.
5	I have only a few words to say......best chicken (real chicken) sandwiches in the Carolinas, bar none.
5	Great service! Always friendly. If you get a kids meal, turn the toy back on for a kids ice cream!
5	No better chicken in the Carolinas !!
5	Delicious food.  Courteous employees.  Clean restaurant.  A welcome break on a long road trip.
4	Politics aside...what's not to like about Chick-Fil-A?  The food is great and the workers must be trained to be helpful and pleasant.  A playground for the kids gives the parents a chance to talk amongst themselves.Most people cut through the gas station next door to enter the parking lot...this is an accident waiting to happen.
5	This is the best CFA around.  The food is always hot, tastes great, and the service is awesome!!
5	Now fast food really shouldn't receive reviews but this place is so friendly with good, hot food!  Once I waited in line for a good while and received a free 3 piece chicken fingers and the manager apologized.  I was not upset but I am 24 and most people do not care about the younger crowd and only cater to older individuals...so I was very grateful.
4	Politics notwithstanding, we decided to hit Chick-Fil-A as a Black Friday breakfast before going to the stores. It was pretty great. We each got cups of coffee; she got a chicken biscuit, and I for a bacon, egg & cheese. My food took a little longer, which I didn't understand, but I suppose it was a bit busy in there. She said hers kind of fell apart, and she was keeping it together with ketchup. My biscuit was very solid and tasted quite good. The bacon was thick and plentiful, and the egg was fluffy without disintegrating. The coffee in both cases was piping hot, and I burned my tongue on first taste, but it made for good road sips. The staff was wonderfully accommodating, as usual and as always.
