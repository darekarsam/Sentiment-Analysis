1	The urgent care here is ridiculous!! Waited for over a hour and  a half just to see the nurse practitioner who was only in here for 5 minutes tops. I wouldn't have come here but this was the only urgent care open on Sunday.
1	OK...10 or 12 people waiting and later found out there is one doctor there on a Monday morning. The lady at the front desk was very rude and helped me feel stupid for coming in. She told me that I should be in an emergency room which is fine but it was the way she said it and her demeanor that was rude to my wife and I. So I left and went to the new John C. Lincoln facility near Carefree Hwy and I-17. Wow what a difference! Those people were standing tall to help. I'll never go to Anthem Health Network again for anything. All it takes for me is one rude person who is apparently placed in an important patient contact role and I'm outta there for good. She did it in full view of three other employees so to me it was apparent that was just how patients are allowed to be treated there.
1	3 hr wait then finally was taken back. There is nothing immediate about this facility. The ladies at the desk can not give any clue for a time wait. Then when u go back you talk to a med assistant "keith" who doesn't want to know anything about what's going on. All that can be said is if you can go anywhere else do!!!
