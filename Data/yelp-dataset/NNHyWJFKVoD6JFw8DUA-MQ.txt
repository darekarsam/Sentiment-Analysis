5	Really like this place. They have always done a great job. Finally made the switch after Super Cuts was always hit or miss.
5	This place is amazing they all cut like they been doing it there whole life and the best part about this place is there good prices witch means you can afford to get one every week!!!
2	I have long hair and just wanted a trim. I found this place to be dirty. The guy dug around for scissors in a hair filled drawer.

1	So, I was hungry and I decided to eat at Subway which is next door, I noticed there was this barber shop so I thought to myself that I needed a haircut. There was 2 barbers working that day, they were both busy with customers plus 1 more customer waiting. I walked in, they acknowledged me and I asked if they accepted credit cards, they replied Yes! I sat down waiting patiently for my turn for about 20 mins. One of the barbers was done with his customer, he took the next customer... He was done with that customer and it was my turn, BUT NO IT WASN'T!!! Someone else walked in and they started cutting his hair. I felt discriminated against because they knew I was there, if that customer had already made an appointment for that time or if he was waiting outside, I don't know that! The barber should have at least said they had already been waiting their turn or had an appointment. I got no explanation of why they ignored me! One thing I'm sure, there are most of them good reviews but left a bad taste in my mouth so they will not get my business in the future.
