5	Desired Nails is the place to go if you're looking for fantastic service and quality. I have been a client of Lynda's for years and am thrilled that she has now opened her own salon. I have tried many other salons and spas around Charlotte and have never found anyone who even compares!
5	Lynda at Desired Nails is the best! Talented, knowledgeable, concerned with giving you the look and service you want while protecting the health of your nails. Friendly, personal service at great prices; the spa pedicure will make you forget all about stress!
5	Absolutely loved it here.  They people were all very friendly and they did a fantastic job on my pink and white set and pedicure!!
5	Lynda is meticulous in her work. She takes her time and leaves you with the prettiest nails!  She's also very knowledgeable about her products and super easy to talk to.  Then again,  we are both from NH so we had plenty to talk about! I'll definitely be coming back.  :)
5	I' ve found my  new place to get my nails done, Lynda is located in Atherton  mill in southend which was super convenient  for me . Her studio is very clean personable and friendly. and my nails look amazing she took the time to ask what I wanted and the look great! I'll be back for sure.
