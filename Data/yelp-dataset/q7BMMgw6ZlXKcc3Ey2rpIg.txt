5	Best food in town!
5	This is THE place to call for FREE community assistance when your tummy hurts. Or you get a splinter in your thumb. Or maybe a bloody nose. I know I always call them when I get a cramp in my right foot from stretching. You can call them if you burn the toast and you set your fire alarm off! If there's a cat sitting outside your bedroom window howling like a baby at night, and it won't stop so you can't sleep, call these guys and they'll come get that kitty so you can get some zzzz's. I've called them when I locked my kids in my car and when I thought I saw a UFO in the sky. I've called these guys when McDonald's messed up my cheeseburger. I ordered one with no pickles and when it had pickles the cashier, clearly a GED recipient, had the nerve to argue with me! The nerve of some people!
