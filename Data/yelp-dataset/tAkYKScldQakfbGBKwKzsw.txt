3	Right by the Charlevoix metro stop and we pass this place all the time. Decided to give it a try on a snowy night, which may have been a bad idea. It was cold. We were back in a corner, ignored for large stretches, and cold in full sweaters, thermals, etc. Eventually we skipped desert just to go get our coats!Most of the food was good to really good. Escargot was a hit, bread came to the table warm, they brought a couple of surprise little pieces that were each delightful. We were psyched for our main dishes and that's where it went a bit downhill. We both ordered pasta (half the small menu is pasta so figured that was a speciality) and were both disappointed. Great interesting sauces, perfect shrimp on the wife's dish etc, but the pasta itself on both was bland, doughy and stick in the teeth chewy, making it feel like a giant rock in the stomach. Maybe an off day? Will update if we drop in again.
4	Great food for french cuisine and the portions are filling, nice and cozy atmosphere. Good service. It's perfect for a date! It's worth a try!
5	What a great little restaurant. It's definitely one of Montreal's best kept secrets. The food is fantastic. High class yet homey at the same time (don't ask me how they accomplished this, they just do). The service was impeccable. And when they found out it was my birthday, they presented be with a beautiful creme brulee on the house. We hadGarlic-y escargot (very good, very tender, save some of that bread that you get when you sit down to soak up the cheesy garlic butter)Apple Fennel Soup: OMG get this, just get this. Its savoury and rich and you'd never think to put those two together in a soup, but this works.Duck: absolutely perfect (why does this chef not have a michelin star already?)a vodka pasta dish: we perfect. Pasta wasn't as al dente as we normally prefer it, but the sauce more than made up for itfree creme brulee: good enough that I would've paid for it 10x over =)We'll be back again, and again, and again.
