5	Under new management, definitely turning the place around! Food is very good and at very reasonable prices. Great beer selection and nice eat in dining area as well as a separate bar area with plenty of tvs. Going back, definitely recommend this one to friends
5	Great food! The new owner has really turned things around and revamped both the menu as well as the atmosphere. This place is definitely worth the trip! They even offer specials on both food and beverages on a regular basis! Thumbs up!

5	Great place for inexpensive drinks and quality food. Good menu and great atmosphere. I ordered a Texan burger and my wife had a hog fish sandwich, both were great. I highly recommend the hogs head bar and grill.
5	Bought a groupon to this little place so the wife and I decided to head over and check it out.  This place was AMAZING!!!  I got a "this little piggy" burger, which was quite possibly the best burger I have ever had.  I will definitely be back.
5	They pour a fantastic Guinness,  and the everything on the menu looked amazing. I went with "This Little Piggy"  a spicy, pepper jack burger piled high with bacon, pulled pork and slaw. I know that I'll be coming back for more soon.
5	My wife and I heard about this restaurant/bar through a friend and we were not disappointed. The food is great, the people are friendly and the prices you can't beat. We've been there three times since hearing about it and we will continue to stop by.
