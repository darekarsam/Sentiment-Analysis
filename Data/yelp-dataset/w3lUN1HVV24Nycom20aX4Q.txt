5	The most amazing new boutique in Scottsdale! Boho vibe with clothes from Free People, Minkpink, Junk food, Soludos, and more. And the hats! so good.
5	Wonderful locally owned boutique. Carries great brands you can't find everywhere and amazing staff. Very quaint store. I highly recommend checking out Shop Pepper.
5	Walking through old-town I stumbled upon this little Gem.  They were super helpful in picking out clothes that were right for me.  It seems to have some great finds you can't find elsewhere!
5	Super cute new boutique in Old Town. Every time I go in, I find something rad. Went to their summer sale last weekend and got a million compliments on a dress that was originally $118, which I scored for $20! Scottsdale and Indian School...go!
