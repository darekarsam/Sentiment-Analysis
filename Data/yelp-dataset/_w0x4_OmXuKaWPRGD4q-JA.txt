4	Passed by this place a few times and noticed how cute the place looked. I decided to venture in on a warm day and noticed they had ice cream/gelato/yogurt. Turns out it is HOMEMADE, from scratch! (milk, eggs, etc) The shopkeeper was very generous and let my boyfriend and I try basically all the flavors. The strawberry yogurt was fresh, smooth, and unlike other yogurt places like Yeh (they taste more like ice than anything in my opinion), the cookie dough was so rich! We decided to take a small and they fit two flavors in it and boy did they give big portions for a small. I honestly love this place for their homemade ice creams. I came a second time to have the hazelnut flavor, I have yet to try their coffees and pastries, but I think I'm more interested in their cold desserts...Anyway worth checking out on a hot day if you're in St. Laurent.
5	A gem of a place for ice cream.   I have had their unique Black Pepper which you don;t notice until the aftertaste.   Other flavors I have tried were Amaretto,  Passionfruit and Cafe Epic.   All in all a really good place for Ville St. Laurent.
5	It has been closed for 3 weeks, although all the fixtures are still in the store and there is no sign that they are permanently closed
