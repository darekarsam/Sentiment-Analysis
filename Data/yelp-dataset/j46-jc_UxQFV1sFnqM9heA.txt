5	Cute little cafe facing Parc La Fontaine.  Quiet and cozy.  I just had a cappuccino, but I was oh so tempted by the delicious sandwiches they were making.  This place appears to be a favorite by locals.  Friendly & chillax staff :)
4	Just happened to pass by this place and the name caught my boyfriend's and I's attention.  The sandwiches are not bad... Not bad at all. It's about 7$ a sandwich but they are HUGE!!! And the pizzas looked so good!!! Cute place. I'd go again
4	Decent place!Good sandwiches. Friendly cashier. Great location to pick up a last minute sandwich before heading into the park for an afternoon stroll. Everything looked good.
