4	Brunch is a fairly inoffensive cafe to dine in if you're looking for a quick lunchtime bite. It isn't the largest so can quickly become rather overcrowded but to be honest, everywhere is the same at lunchtime. It's in a good location and the prices are very reasonable too. They offer teas, coffees, a good selection of rolls, sandwiches and bagels and the cake section isn't too bad either. The best thing about Brunch are the big comfy armchairs and once you've been sat for five minutes, you won't feel like getting up.
4	Brunch is a pretty decent cafe to eat at. Situated just across the road from the main University campus, George Square, Brunch is a really convenient place for students to go for a snack or for lunch. It is also just a short walk from the city centre and so it is an easy place to reach. Brunch is a sandwich and coffee shop and makes their own sandwiches fresh everyday. They also serve bagels, pastries, and home made cakes. I love to come into Brunch and get their home made brownie as it is always really fluffy and moist with big chunks of chocolate - yum! Brunch serves a whole range of different teas and coffees which you are able to sit in or take away. They make smoothies too which are really gorgeous and fresh, and priced pretty reasonably at about four pounds. Brunch has a decent sized seating area inside, with lovely comfy couches and armchairs which are always very inviting! A lovely place to go for lunch or for an afternoon snack.
