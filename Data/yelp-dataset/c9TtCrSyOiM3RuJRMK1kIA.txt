1	My girlfriend had one request , don't touch the bottom tooth and Gina thought she was so scary talented that this request did not apply to her. I also requested that they not "procedure hunt" on my girlfriend because she would not come back but the arrogant dr. hunts to the beat of his own drum. A team of hustlers is what you'll get here so beware.Did i mention the endless calls from Jackie? eeeeek
5	I enjoyed my visit to SmileLines Dentistry. I like Dr. Lines, Gia and the rest of the staff! They were all pleasant and friendly with my daughter and I.
3	Friendly staff! Since I forgot that I have a DMO plan the office hooked me up with a first time patient special of $40.00 for x-ray and cleaning. I thought that was cool. The x-ray tech was new to the position. So it took sometime for the x-rays. I wasn't very impressed with the senior tech that assisted the trainee. She didn't put gloves on when touching my mouth piece for the x-ray. She realized it when I looked at her.  Then the senior tech then put gloves on and then put the mouth piece in my mouth to show the trainee how to do it. The trainee advised that she was going to take an actual picture of my mouth with this big photographiers camera. I thought that was weird. I never had that. Sonia the hygienist was funny and she was very gental with the cleaning. They should have offered shades for the extremely bright light and also to prevent water from going into my eyes. Over all experiance is a 3. Needs a little improvement with customer service and sanitation. I did like the greeting when entering the office. It made me feel welcomed.
5	Love the staff! Our whole family including my in laws goes here. They make you feel comfortable from the minute you walk in. Whenever we have had a procedure that costs more than our insurance covers they have worked out a payment plan with us. They are professional and courteous. I recommend them to anyone that is looking for a dentist.
