5	Can you beat a $2 buck car wash?  So you have to do it yourself, c'mon Man, get sudsy and do your own car (shout out to all your high rollers who pay Danny's for their luxury wash)!  Weiss Guys on 40th Street is a T-bird secret.  Tucked away next to Circle K, it offers self serve and a drive through wash.  Always clean and neat, well-stocked, and with very friendly service.  If you pay for the drive-thru, make sure to give the guys a couple bucks for their hard work.  They do a great job drying your car off and deserve the cash.
5	Even a gun dryer, perfect for motorcycles!
2	I wrote a big scathing story, but decided just to put it simply.Their water is cold. Go somewhere else if you need/want warm water to rinse your car or undercarriage.
5	I went here for the Dog Wash. IT is very nice and works great. It did not take long to get my dog cleaned. You do not need shampoo. Here is what is included: Tearless ShampooOatmeal ShampooVet Grade ShampooConditionerWarm Water RinseTub DisinfectantDe Skunk DeodorizerBlow DryerI highly recommend it and will be back.
5	I love this place! I started going here because I was given some free car wash vouchers. The guys that work here are so friendly. I always feel like I get the VIP treatment even though I'm just sitting in my car and vacuuming my own car. I have even had the guys give me a free windshield out of the vending machine when another guys got stuck and last time j was there he asked if I needed more time on the vacuum. Last time I was there I even literally almost ran into two of the owners (at least I think they were the owners). They were also super friendly and made sure I had everything I needed. I mean it's no glamorous car wash so if you are lazy and want it all done for you then this isn't your place but if you are just needing a car wash and don't mind vacuuming yourself and wiping down the inside of your car this is the place! Remember to tip the guys for all their hard work. Thanks Weiss Guys!
