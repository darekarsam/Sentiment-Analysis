1	I had the worst experience of my life trying to ship something through this guy.He made me wait for 5 minutes in the lobby while he finished up his phone call.He then proceeded to try to charge me $29 for a very small item to ship.Please avoid this place!!!
2	Store is convenient, However I wasn't provided with any options for shipping a package. And was just told the price of what I needed to pay. If I wanted bad customer service I would've gone to the post office. Probably would've been cheaper, too.
3	I just needed a document notarized and they got it done promptly. $5 seems a bit much, but that's called "supply and demand." I don't have a local bank in Charlotte that might have done this for free, so this is the price.
