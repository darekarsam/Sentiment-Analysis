5	I went to the iPhixation at Metro mall and got my phone customized last year and loved it.  So of course as soon as I got a new phone I decided to get it personalized at the Desert Sky Mall  location, and it looks AMAZING!!   I have an iphone 5, and got them to customize the screen frame and button to look just like the iphone 5s all in pink!  People always ask me how I got it that color. :)  Love these guys, they definitely have the right knowledge and skills.  My phone looks super cute and no one has anything like it, quality is great too! Super happy, thank you again and keep up the good work! :D
5	They are very reasonably priced and take less time than others to replace the glass screen.  The person on the phone was very friendly and helpful.  My daughter referred me to them and they did a great job!
5	I was referred to iPhixation by my sister. I recently got my phone customized at the Desert Sky Mall location. I was helped by Mike.. Not only was he very informative but offered such an amazing selection of different iPhone 5 colored screens and back pieces. I wasn't charged too much and felt that their prices were very reasonable. I was given an exact time of when my phone would be done.. I shopped and was satisfied with not only my finished phone, but that it was finished when it said it would be. They offer extended warranties and made sure I was happy before I left. My iPhone 5 is a reflective purple, I'm in love!!If you want to customize your phone, I would say iPhixation is your go to spot. Wide selection, great customer service, and very prompt.
2	Service was fast and customer service was good. However, the warranty covers very little time, and shortly thereafter, my screen was not as responsive as my original screen. I would hang up on people, add calls, and have lots of difficulty sending texts.... I would recommend spending the extra money and going through original mfr to get screen repaired.
