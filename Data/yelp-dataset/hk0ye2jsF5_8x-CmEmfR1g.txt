5	I love Samurai.  They are the absolute best sharpening company in town!
5	I am writing this review because I feel sorry for Samurai Shear owner (I forget her name right now).  I am a big review reader so I almost didn't call her after reading the bad review, but I'm so glad I did.  After calling she said that she sharpens the shears for something like 100 salons in the valley.  We set an appointment to meet up to give her the shears and she said that we could walk in the salon next store and ask them for a reference if I was weary.  Not to mention there really isn't a lot at risk, she loans you a pair of shears to borrow as yours are being sharpened.  Plus we tested them out right away to make sure that they were sharp and sure enough the loaners were great.  She returned the sharpened shears in 48 hours and they were as good as new.  I hope the review from Howard doesn't discourage people from using her because she is convenient, quick, great price, ethical, and does great work.  So glad we found you and best of luck to your wonderful small business!
5	I've been doing business with Samurai Shear Works for 8 years. The customer service is great. They truly make me feel like family. They go above and beyond to ensure your satisfaction. This is a husband and wife team and I love giving my business to a local, family owned operation. The shears they sell are good quality and their prices are great! I highly recommend this sharpening company over the others in the valley. I've been doing hair for 18 years and they are the BEST!
