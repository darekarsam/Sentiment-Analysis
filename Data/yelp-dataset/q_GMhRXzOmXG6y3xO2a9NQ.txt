2	One of my least favorite places to get a cup of joe.  The problem with this Starbuck's is that there aren't any seats.  None at all, so forget about taking a load off and relaxing.  Honestly there's not even much room to line up and wait to be served.  If you are the third or fourth person in line, you basically end up standing in the mall instead of Starbuck's.  Of course, getting things like sugar or milk can be logistically complicated trying to maneuver around other customers and various product displays jammed into such a tiny spot.
3	New chocolate salty caramel muffin to die for! Unfortunately this particular Starbucks at Alexis Nihon is a bit cramped for space. Once you get in, you may NEVER get out... haha just kidding, but that was how I felt when there were two baby strollers in line and a decent crowd of people waiting for their coffees!
3	My least preferred Starbucks so far... I don't mind that they don't have any seats, but the service is extremely slow and inefficient...In addition, the humongous amount of merchandise gives me the feeling that it was more of a boutique than a cafe. If you are in a hurry for caffeine, then this is definitely not the right place.
