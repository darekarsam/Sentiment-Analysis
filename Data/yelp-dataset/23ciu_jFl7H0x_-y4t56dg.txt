4	I just started attending the Arizona International Buddhist Meditation Center after a friend recommended I come with him. Meetings are Wednesday nights at 7pm on Temple Street (the center may be difficult to find as it is located in a residential house). There is parking available in front the house as well as a church parking lot across the street. Cushions are provided for your comfort and the meditation session lasts about 45 minutes. Shane will ring a bell and talk you through the first 5 to 10 minutes. Afterwards, silence commences and you try not to think of anything at all. Once the meditation session ends, Shane leads a short discussion session to allow for questions and for the resident monk to read a prayer aloud.I feel relaxed and at peace when I come here. Everyone is kind and welcoming, no judgement! If you are looking for a group environment and friendly community to meditate with, this is the perfect spot in Arizona!
