3	We have been so excited for this restaurant to open! We decided to check it out tonight. First, let me say, the service was EXCELLENT. The servers were friendly and attentive. I don't think any of us ever had an empty glass. The food arrived promptly and accurately. My kids split a Bbq bacon burger and an order of medium wings. My husband chose the fish and chips and I had the onion marmalade smothered pork chops. The kids reported the burger was good, but the wings were too salty. At first, my pork chops  and garlic mashed potatoes were bland, so, I added salt and pepper which helped.Lastly, my husband's fish was, well, fishy, so he didn't finish it. Hopefully, they will improve the quality of the food. If not, Augie's up the road will continue to be our regular haunt .
5	I love working here! I get to work the lunch shift mostly with Dave as my manager. It is so refreshing working for an owner that really cares for their employees. All the girls I work with like having a manager that helps out on the floor and can relate to us during down time. Hopefully I will get to work here for years to come!!!
5	I have been here several times and have had no issues. The staff is very friendly and professional. The food is great (especially the burgers) and I will keep going back as long as they'll have me.
5	Really good restaurant, good food, professional service, much better than what was there.
