2	Lots of love for Stasha, but Matthew is so unprofessional. I needed help and Stasha tried her hardest to help, but was unsuccessful. She goes to get Matthew & this guy is socializing with some random for 10 minutes plus. So then she has to help a bunch of people because he's out on the floor chit chatting, he finally goes to help someone & start whining about them being busy.... But this is not the first time I saw him chit chatting and slacking off. I seen it more than once, more than twice on previous visits. The only reason, I'm giving more the required 1 star, is being Stasha has been so nice & apologetic. She's even offered me water from their fountain. Can't say I won't come back, but if he's here, I'll be expecting minimum.
