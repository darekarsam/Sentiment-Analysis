4	This place has the strangest variety of all things man... You can find all kinds of tools (discount prices), supplies for almost every home/garden need, and knick knacks galore! (even bawdy humor gifts like whoopee cushions and fart machines). They are always running specials and sales that can be found in the center isles... This is always a fun store to go to when you need something (cheaper)... you never know what you'll find!Some of the best buys I have found at Northern include garden hoses (great quality hoses at discounted prices), Wrench and ratchet sets, tool organizers, a motor for a wood splitter, wood splitters (for those of you that split your own wood the purchase is totally worth it), and grilling accessories.
1	I bought a pressure washer last year from these people and got the two year replacement warrantee.  I had issues with the pump from the get go and instead of reaching it they repaired it twice.  Now it won't run and before I could get it in the door , they said they would not repair under the warranty.  They were to look at it and call me in two day.  I never heard from them so I picked it up after a week and it had never been touched.  I will not be back!!!
