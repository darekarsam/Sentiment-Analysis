3	We made an early reservation before seeing a show at Espace Go next door. The place is bright and airy with a great design concrete bar area with large windows open onto St. Laurent. It was busy with the theatre crowd on Saturday evening.We hit a bit of a snafu when the host couldn't find my reservation and jokingly asked if I reserved under an alias but he told us it wouldn't be a problem to accomodate us.The menu was interesting, representative of the various cultures that defined Montreal's famous world expo in 1967 as well as Montreal.We tried the octopus with falafel and the duck "balls" and both were very good and well priced. The duck plate was beautifully presented with great color on the plate. The "mignardises" was the perfect sweet ending - a quartet of mini bites including a hazelnut financier, macaron, cassis gelee and what tasted like a homemade coffee crisp bite...a steal at 4$Service was friendly and attentive with the waiters taking the time to explain the dishes.The portions are tapas style and it does add up to sample a few plates. Its a great place for a small tasty bite however.
