3	Our waiter was friendly and helpful but clearly struggling to serve more tables then he could reasonably handle alone. The decor was chill but a little generic, and personally I think a nice restaurant is severely diminished by TVs playing sitcoms mounted on the walls where the art should be. The eggplant parmesan and the lasagne were both tasty, cheesy, sizable, not disappointing, and the bread was fresh and hot. Sitting in the wide open window in the summer breeze on St Laurent in Little Italy is always nice, and given that a lot of our favourite restaurants in the area are closed on Mondays this place was a lifesaver that kept the hungry kids happy.
4	On my visit to Montreal, Canada, I stopped by this Italian restaurant considered by the locals as one of the best pizzerias in town. I ordered the Pizza Margherita which was decent and the Fried Calamari that was excellent, probably the best Calamari I ever had.I will definitely comeback to this restaurant on my next visit to Montreal.
4	Nice server, good pizzas.The tout garnie was my favourite (we tried that plus the meat-lover & funghi).The best part? The pizzas are woodfire. An enjoyable friday lunch.
3	Wanting some real pizza (i.e., woodfire rather than fried!), we tried this place to take away a couple. We got the Cacciacavalo and the Margerita... All in all, they were good, though we noted nothing extraordinary about them. The one thing we did note was the price... 40$ for 2 pizze? Seriously? For that price, you could at least put some gold or foie gras on your pizze!
3	i went to their workshop last year where they showed the art behind a pizza. did grabbed something to eat and drink afterwards as i was still hungry.nothing to write home about. drink was expensive but boozy. as for the pizza, expensive! on the other hand, wood oven!the really bad: place is, most of the time, empty except during summer where the terrace is fullanyway, for the asking price, you're better off somewhere else
