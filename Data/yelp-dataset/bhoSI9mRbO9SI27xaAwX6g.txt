5	This off-the-wall little place is darling.  My mom started going here to get her hair cut in 1994 when we moved to Arizona and I have been going back to get "something or other" done ever since.  They have outstanding customer service, after just one visit they will know who you are when you call, and you can't beat the prices.The staff is VERY VERY professional and they have virtually no turnover.  The owner, the nail tech, and the woman who does my brows have all been there for a long, long time.  16 years to be exact - if not more!If you are shopping around for a great place to get in on a moment's notice or you need a new "hair dresser home" - check it out.  Definitely not a risk.
1	WORST color &  cut job ive ever had! The color was spotchy, faded into a goldish color the very next week & the cut was un-even. I ended up having to go to someone else to fix her horrible attempt at  "high lights" !!!! The minute you sit down she is rushing you out of the door & she didnt even blow dry my hair all the way! DO NOT GO THERE IF YOU ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT YOUR HAIR!!!
5	Great place to get a hair cut! Staff is professional, they genuinely cares about their customers, and pride themselves on the quality of service they provide.
