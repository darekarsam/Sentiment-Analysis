1	the KFC on el camino del norte (mlk) and craig has the worse food ever. don't even bother to go
5	Ok for those people that say the food sucks and wtever WELL it is fastfood so what more do youu expect for $5 ? ANYWAYS im here on yelp to talk about my customer service experience at the kfc on jones & lakeMead.... I was having an emotional day rolled up to the window, ordered my food, paid for my food, waited 5mins for chicken bites (NoBigDeal) When i got my food the lady at the window "Jessica" said here is 3 extra cookie to make youu smile :) it blew my mind that this girl noticed i wasnt having a good day & tried to do something about it when in reality she could have just handed me my order & said NXT but noooo she took the time to see what was going on & she did actually make me smile :) Thankyouu jessica :) i tried calling the store to speak to a manager but they didnt answer so im taking this review to the streets & corp.
