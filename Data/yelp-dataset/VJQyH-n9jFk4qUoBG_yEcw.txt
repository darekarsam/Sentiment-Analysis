1	this was the second gel manicure at this salon, my nails were filed down to mush, even with the gel polish on them they bend like crazy, both thumbnails broke the next day, won't go back
5	Been here three times with my elderly father and with sisters. Today Bob is doing a great job. The foot massage is the best ever.
1	Disgusting bunch of liars! Told my friend it would be an hour to get ONE NAIL REPAIRED but when I asked for a full set done they told me twenty minutes. I asked how come they told my friend it would be an hour, she replied, "Oh. Ok." I asked again and she walked away. I've had my nails done here before, but because I was in a rush I let a mediocre job go. Not this time! Don't give these rude pieces of trash the time of day let alone your money. I've never had anyone be so RUDE!
1	This is my second time here. Both times I was rushed, treated poorly. I asked for nail art and the young woman ( Carol ) nearly threw the samples at me! Then didn't give me a chance to pick something out!!! This is supposed to be a nice experience and yet both times I felt they were pushing me out of the place!!! I NEVER GOT THE NAIL ART!!!I WON"T GO BACK HERE AGAIN!!!!
