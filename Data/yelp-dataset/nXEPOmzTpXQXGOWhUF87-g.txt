4	I've noticed that this place opened up a while ago back and forth from my house, although I usually go to the Blue Diamond or Durango AT&T.I've had trouble with my bluetooth with a new phone, and calling AT&T didn't solve it, so I stopped by this place on the way home. Even though I wasn't purchasing anything or even looking around, they were very helpful in assisting me with the problem that I had, and explained thoroughly on what to do next time the same thing happens. I've experienced some poor customer service in other AT&T stores, but with this short visit, they may have increased the chance of purchasing my next phone here.
5	The folks over the phone on the billing end were as useless as udders on a boar hog but Christina and Jessie did everything they could to resolve the issue. The issues was not resolved because it was out of the store's control but I commend their efforts and professionalism nonetheless.
