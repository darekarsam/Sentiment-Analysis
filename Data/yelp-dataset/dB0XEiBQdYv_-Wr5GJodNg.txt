5	Excellence is earned not given This karate school teaches excellent I pride. I have never been so challenged As I am with this dojo. The staff is friendly and encouraging and takes the time to personally know each student. Sandoval strives to teach real world application of this martial arts. I look forward to many years of study under this teacher. I would highly suggest this Jojo for anyone looking for real world applications especially those in security and law enforcement.From, Dennis Erickson PPOQA license 1786B
5	Sensei Lorenzo has his heart and mind in the right place....not often you find an instructor who truly cares about each student! Highly recommended!
5	Sensei Joe is very patient with my kids, they are learning discipline, respect and honor, which all kids need. We signed them to teach them courage, self confidence and focus. My husband is also taking classes to get his black belt, which he was very close to getting some 20 years ago.The dojo is open every day of the week, which is very flexible with our busy schedules.  We feel lucky to have Sensei Joe as a leader and role model to our kids.
