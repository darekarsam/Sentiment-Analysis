3	This is a standard TCBY, with the exception of one thing - No White Chocolate Mousse Frozen Yogurt...who does that?  Don't get me wrong, I am a great fan of frozen yogurt treats, I am just mostly disappointed in this TCBY.  Every TCBY I go to has it on the menu...but this being the only TCBY in Montreal, the options are rather limited here.The staff is friendly, and they have a variety of toppings, including heath, orea, aero, m&ms, etc.In lieu of the missing white chocolate mousse, we instead chose the golden vanilla and the standard chocolate.  It's the typical TCBY recipe which you can't go wrong with.Maybe when you go there, their menu will include white chocolate mousse?
4	White Chocolate Mousse will be returning July 4th.Upgrading to 4 stars.
3	Good stuff, could use more flavors thought. Many toppings nice staff but a bit expensive for what you're getting
