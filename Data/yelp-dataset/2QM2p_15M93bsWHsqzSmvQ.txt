1	They will tell you your insurance company states you have not met your deductible, and will have you pay out of pocket... and if you do not you cannot be seen.  Then they will bill your insurance carrier, and get paid, and not reimburse you, unless you happen to call your insurance carrier and note they have been paid and call for reimbursement.  When you call for reimbursement, they will not apologize, and will treat you in a less than kind manner.  I guess getting caught double-dipping ticked them off.
5	Stopped by here with some strep throat. They were very quick, and the lady up front was very nice and accommodating. The Doctor was very helpful and he offered me many different options for medicines and treatments. I've also had other family members come to this location and they all enjoyed their experience.
5	Fast and easy. Love WAHOO!
5	For lucky, noon on Sat & no one there!! Checked in before, got my appt time, in in less than 3 min or less, vitals taken right away, in & out in 15 min!!!! Amazing
5	Did online check in. Was in a room quickly waiting for the doctor. Waited about 15 for a doctor. Had a script and out the door all under 30 minutes.
2	Seriously, what's the point in filling out info online and making an appointment? You show up at your appointment time and have to fill out the same info and wait forever to be seen. So ridiculous.
