3	I stopped in at the story Yesterday 15 mins before they were closing to check it out.  The Men's section of clothes is in the back room.  While there is some very cool items in there and the prices are fair...it is UNGODLY hot and dark in that back room.  I am going to go back when it is a little cooler out so I can spend more time in there looking around.
5	Amazing thrift store! The owner was extremely kind and polite to me so I'm not too sure why one reviewer was saying he was rude. They had baskets of clothes out front that were free for homeless or needy people which I thought was great considering places like goodwill often overcharge for clothing that should be donated to those in need. Great find on a Robert cavalli jacket and J.crew pants that were literally like new. Prices were completely reasonable for quality second hand clothing. For sure will go back!!!
5	I had a great shopping experience. The owner was very helpful and knowledgeable. This was my first time at the store and I was so impressed. I am forsure going back again.
