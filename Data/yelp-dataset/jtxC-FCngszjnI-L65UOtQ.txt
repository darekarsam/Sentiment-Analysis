4	This is the perfect place to get a personalized gift for a wedding, baptism, or any special event. The customer service is always great, and they have plenty of ideas for numerous events. The only thing that made me give them four instead of five stars is the fact that none of their stuff is actually sterling silver.  It is all silver plated.
5	Staff is amazingly helpful. Came in needing a gift for a very close friend. The guy that helped was very helpful gave us a variety of gift options and was extremely considerate of our budget. He was creative and also helped us with the engraving, we had no idea what to put on there. People like him make coming here a great experience.
