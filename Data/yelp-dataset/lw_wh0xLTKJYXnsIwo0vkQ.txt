5	Visited twice in the past two weeks. Excellent very fresh sushi at a great price. Large menu for the size of the restaurant. The friendly owners make all the sauces themselves. Takeout and event catering available. Seaweed salad is ample for sharing- served with mixed greens and cucumber/mango sticks with a delicious dressing. Try the caterpillar roll- best ever! Liked the tempura but would suggest giving the ramen noodles a miss. Will be back!
5	Really enjoyed the sushi, the presentation of the rolls was some of the best I've seen. The quality of the food was so good as well. All the sauces are home made and taste amazing.
5	Fresh sushi. All sauces are made in restaurant. Excellent salad and sushi. My new favourite!
5	Wonderful food and very nice people. It's the best sushi we have ever had! Blink and you'll miss it from the outside but once inside I guarantee you'll return again and again.
5	Unexpected genuine pleasure in a strip mall, walking distance from our hotel. Clean, well-lit, casual, varied menu, fresh & interesting scratch-made everything, family operated, very personal service.
