4	I received a coupon in the mail and decided to call and was able to get in the same day in the morning around 11. We had an appointment but there was a computer glitch and we had to wait about 20 mins no biggie had a few things to pick up anyways. So we are finally called in and things went great the photographer was friendly and professional. Best part is she got some great shots of my amazing kiddo! I left only spending 24 bucks and ordered quite a few sheets! Score! On top of it all since we had to wait she threw in some freebies!! It only takes about a week to pick up the pics. I cant wait! I will absolutely be coming back!
4	I have been using JCP since my daughter was born. They have done a great job documenting my daughter's life so far. The prices seem to be reasonable. The photographers always seem to work hard to get the little ones to do something cute for the shots. They have lots of cute props and ideas if you ask them for their opinions. Make sure you request Christy as your photographer because she is the best I have used there.
5	I had my son's 10 month old pictures taken here. He was very grumpy but Katie was really good with him and gave us time to calm him down. We've been though having pictures taken before so I knew the drill. Katie never rushed us and even gave us mini breaks for a quick bottle session.
