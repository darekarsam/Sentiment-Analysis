2	It's a basic bar. There's nothing exceptional to drink here, just the same old domestics on tap. Liquor selection had nothing noteworthy either. You could play a game of pool or darts, but it was quite crowded on a Saturday night, so you couldn't really enjoy it. There was standing room only, no patio, and a low quality sound system. They don't even do tabs here. They will charge your card 20 or 40 dollars at a time, and just give you the difference in cash. That is just bizarre...at best. Just make it cash only. Booze was cheap, and bartenders and security were very nice, however, so I guess I can give it two stars.
