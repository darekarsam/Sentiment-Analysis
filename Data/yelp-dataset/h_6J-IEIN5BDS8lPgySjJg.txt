5	Freedom Landscaping has done a wonderful job for me for years now!  I have rental properties, and my personal home which Freedom Landscaping maintains weekly.  I've never had such a professional landscape company in all my years of owning real estate.  They show up every week without fail on the same day!!  Their employees pay attention to my lawn and irrigation system, and they actually communicate with me.Freedom Landscaping responds more quickly to one-time clean ups and problems than any other company I've ever used.  I recommend them to everyone!!
5	Freedom Landscaping has been caring for our lawn for the past 2 years.  They service weekly and have done our winter lawn.  Their employees show up when they are scheduled and my lawn is always beautifully manicured.  Thank you Freedom for GREAT service!
