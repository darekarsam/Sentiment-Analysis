2	I was disappointed with this place. It's a nice, open space with lots of natural sunlight, but the food was just ok and the portions were pitiful. I ordered the chicken pesto panini, and it tasted ok but had to be the world's smallest chicken breast. (This poor chicken probably never got hit on by any of the popular roosters.) The fresh fruit side was pretty flavorless. I understand the fruit is out of season, but I've had fruit recently at many other restaurants in metro Phoenix that was much more flavorful. The servers are friendly but very young and obviously have very little experience.  I will be back only if I'm in Sun Lakes again and Burger King is closed.
3	Nice open and comfortable cafe by the pools of Oakwood IronOaks Active Adult community. The food is fine. Its not your fabulous diner but for a quick bite to eat with friendly staff not bad at all. Very reasonable prices. Limited menu. Breakfast and lunch is served. Well worth a try...
