2	So I've been here a few times.This trip I was looking for inspiration.  When I told the older lady that I was just here to get ideas for my project she said "oh" and made a face. I brushed it off cause I was on a mission.Aisles of paper but hardly any embellishments or samples. Almost nothing but flat stickers. BIG but nothing special.  Service... Rude. Selection... Boring especially compared to Scrapbook Kyandyland.
1	The lady with curly dark hair, short, I think is the owner is soo rude. I was treated so bad when something rang up wrong and I went in for a refund. Your better off just going somewhere else.
4	Came in as an out of towner. Really cute. Love that they didn't hound me. Cute kits. Bought a few. Wish they had more G45.
4	Love this scrapping store. Their supplies stand out and are different from the every day corporate craft store supplies. Nice friendly staff and they are not pushy. Just wish they were closer to Henderson rather than the airport area.
