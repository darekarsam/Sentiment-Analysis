1	First time going here. Horrible service. Wouldn't recommend anyone going here. I was told two ppl would do my micros n it would take 5 hours at the most but only one person braided my hair and it took nearly 8 hours. The braiders were rude and didnt even acknowledge my presence except when they asked me to pay. It was the most uncomfortable 8 hours I've experienced while getting my hair braided.
4	I have been getting my hair braided my Sister Sister for years and I'm very pleased with their services.  The team that the sisters have do a great job and the sbraid last. The cost  is a little higher than most  places but it's worth every dollar.
5	Sister Sister  does amazing work.  And they are super fast at what they do.I recommend this place for braiding and weaves.
5	You will not regret getting your hair done by these ladies. Very fast, stylish and reasonable.  I come in from out of town to have them do my hair.
