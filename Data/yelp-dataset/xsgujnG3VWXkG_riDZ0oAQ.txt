3	Yelp's description for a 3/5 star rating is perfectly appropriate here, "A-OK". Service is fine, food's alright but boring, and even at 6$-7$ it's over priced for the portion size. I was in the mood for some veggies so I got the Veggie Burger (super dry) and a Beet Salad (pretty good with nice big chunks of beets). Fries were meh. 26oz house beer was solid at 6$. My friend didn't make much of his tacos or sliders, but enjoyed his cocktail. The place gets busy so we waited 30 minutes, went for a coffee nearby. It's cool that they take your phone number and call you when your table's ready, but it's not worth the wait. Maybe a good place to grab a drink and get some snacks, but not ideal if dinner is the main priority.
4	Not expensive and quality food. However, it was really crowded (for a Sunday night) which made the service pretty slow and the waiter looked a bit exhausted. I had the pulled pork tacos... Yummy! Most dishes are in small portions so it is made for different types of appetite. I would recommend for people who are not in a rush, slightly hungry and who want to spend time in a restaurant with busy but trendy ambiance.
4	I most definitely recommend this place.Everything we had was really good and the service was just right. I had to try the L'Grosceasar and was worth every sip and bight.Low prices, good food, good service.
3	Nice to have another option in the area, and a fun one at that with the crazy layered Ceasars and the weirdly, surprisingly delicious deep fried avocado. The room is warm and cozy and almost disturbingly trendy, and nicely laid out in two smaller rooms for additional intimacy. The bartender makes a tasty hot Jameson chocolate if you're looking for something sweet and cozy. A weird fit for the Mile End but I'll go with a-ok.
