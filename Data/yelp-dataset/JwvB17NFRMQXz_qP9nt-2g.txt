5	Called around this morning to several places to get an alternator for my car which turns out is a pretty expensive alternator. When I called Strip Husky I spoke to the owner Corby and they were the most reasonable of anyone I called. Dropped my car off at 11am and ended up needing both an alternator and a battery. Price was still very reasonable for both and they were done in 3 hours flat. Nobody even tried to sell me anything that I didn't need which is very unusual for a mechanic. No pressure at all. Probably my best experience going to a mechanic shop. I will be spreading the word to all my friends about them.
5	This is the ONLY place to go if you want a mechanic who will be completely honest and fair with you. My husband's family has been coming here for the past 20 years and would only trust them with their vehicles. My truck had grinding brakes, a busted radiator, and a transmission that had black tar-like fluid.  Corby let me know up front what the issues were and was more than willing to give me a very reasonable price to fix it up. My truck is perfect now and drives like a new one.
