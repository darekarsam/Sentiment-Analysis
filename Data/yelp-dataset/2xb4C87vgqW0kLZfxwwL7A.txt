5	Neil is a consummate pro. We've had him put in blinds at both our old house and new and he's been on time with great prices and fast delivery and install. Will use again for all out future window cover needs!
5	Just had Neil do the blinds for our rental home. The black out blinds were done first so he brought them out and hung them, then came out with the rest a week later - they look AWESOME! Now I wish I hadn't done the others myself (bought them at Home Depot) 4 years ago. The kitchen and the master suite both look great, thanks to Neil. Thanks!
3	Very knowledgable and professional. Unfortunate that their shutters are made in China. Would have liked to use them but couldn't overlook that.
