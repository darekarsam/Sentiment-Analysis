4	My dad used to brew his own beer. It tasted like a sort of hoppy vomit. Really great. He used to make his own wine too, which he thought was brilliant. Yeah, not great.Step forward Alba Homebrew. They'll actually show you how to brew your own beer properly. And not only beer, they do all manner of alcoholic delights. So it's sort of like doing it yourself, but leaving it to the experts at the same time. A win-win situation.If you are interested in brewing your own tipple I'd definitely recommend here. The owner is really friendly, he'll talk you through everything. And as Sam says, 19p a pint can't be bad...
5	I cheated.  I cheated and bought homebrew goods from another business and I now feel guilt.  Alba is small but perfectly formed and is, in my opinion, Edinburgh's best homebrew shop.
