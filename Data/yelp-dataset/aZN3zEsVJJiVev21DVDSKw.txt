3	Location: St. Denis. Metered parking - use transit, walk or bike. The place: Bright, well laid-out.The goods: I would describe this as 'active lifestyle' wear - so you can grab some yoga or running clothes here, or some comfortable items that you can wear while traveling. Personally, I really like the quality of their clothing, as well as the fit. Service: Meh. The clerk who was there came across as indifferent and spacey. She wasn't really attentive or all that helpful. Price: High.  if you check out their web site, they have a clearance section where you can find some pretty sweet deals. Note that the store doesn't offer the same sales as those you can find online, so if you see an item that you like - check out their site first to see if it's on markdown. Shipping is free.
