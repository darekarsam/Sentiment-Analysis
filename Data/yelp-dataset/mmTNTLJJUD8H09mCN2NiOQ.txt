1	I had a terrible experience. My crown fell off a short time after I had it done by Dr. Michelle--despite the fact that she assured me it would would last for 10 years. I would have settled for a third of that! When I contacted her for reimbursement she refused and suggested that it fell out because of poor dental hygiene. I absolutely do not recommend. Extremely unprofessional!
5	My son went to Designs in Dentistry last Sept for routine cleaning and exam, x rays. We received a collection notice recently and I contacted the office. The dental information provided to Designs was not correct. A wonderful lady by the name of Danielle worked closely with me. I gave her my updated insurance (which has changed from that time). She complete the paperwork and mailed it off for us, keep me in the loop the entire time. Needless to say, delta Dental paid the bill and they are removing us form collections. Danielle is an incredible employee who truly cares.
