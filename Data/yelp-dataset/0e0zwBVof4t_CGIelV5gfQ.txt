1	Situated at a prime tourist location along the summer pedestrian street with pink hanging ball decor, I was pretty surprised that the people behind the coffee bar, the manager, i believe, spoke very little english and really took his sweet time.On top of that - I think that I was overcharged for an iced americano. For one shot of unfancy expresso, $3.50 is definitely steep. Even the best espresso I've had does not go over $3.Enough said. There are much better places where you can get a sexy cup of java.
