4	I started going here recently (well, since moving back to Vegas and in the neighborhood) and have had good experiences with the staff who have tended my nails.  I haven't had a pedicure yet, and haven't seen one being done while there, but the young lady who has helped me is fast, efficient, and very good at fills and full sets of acrylics...they offer other services too, like a real spa should, and I've even thought about permanent makeup options with them....if I ever decide to do that, I'll update this review if I choose them for that service...
5	I LOVE this place. I don't get my nails done anywhere else. Good prices &  great serviceWhen you come, ask for Natalie. Have been getting my nails done with her 5+ years. She's the best!
1	This place is horrible! I've been getting my nails done for years and this was the worst experience I have ever had! First, there were two people working they sat the three of us in boiling hot water for pedicures, didnt ask how the water was and left us for 30 mins. Finally the two started on two of us, my mother in law never had a pedicure before and 6 mins in to hers the lady left and did an entire manicure on her friend that walked in. Who does that? Thats the worst thing you can do in customer service!! When the lady came back to finish, 20 minutes later she didnt apologize or anything! The lady finished mine, without a foot or leg massage and went to my husband with the same tools she used on me!! Gross!!! When I asked her to remove my gel on my fingernails she told she didnt have the time and I could do it myself! Rude!! This place is dirty and has the worst customer service ever! They should've paid me to sit there and deal with the rudeness and crappy service we got!
