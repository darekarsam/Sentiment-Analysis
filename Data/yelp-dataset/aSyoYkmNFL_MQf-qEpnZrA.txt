4	Was really good food.  Had my heart set on ham but they were out.  Opted for the beef brisket.  Was tender and juicy.  Thought about the ribs or honey bbq wings, they looked good too.  I did miss iced tea.  They didn't offer tea but the homemade lemonade tasted great.  The bbq was sweet and not too spicy like some that I've had.  The place had western decor.  The tables were cool.  Whiskey barrels.
5	Best barbecue pork sandwich I have had in years. Service was excellent and you could tell the chef was a barque master. The meat was so tender, sauce was excellent, buns were soft not to mention the price was very reasonable. I highly recommend this place, this was my first time there but I will be back this weekend...with out a doubt.
5	Really enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich.  Am definitely going back for more.  Best BBQ around these parts.
