5	First off, I hate pushy salesmen.   They do make a commission based on purchases.   From day 1 stepping through the door Mcdowell's T-Mobile, Eric has been extremely helpful, patient, and honest regarding services and products.
4	very helpful with buying a new phone. we have never bought a phone before...T-mobile use to do "free Phone" upgrades every 2 years but no more. good service and our rep helped us save a few bucks with a plan change. overall, just dandy.
