5	I have used Clark County carpet cleaning for years. They are by far the friendliest and most honest carpet cleaners in town. I ref everyone to them that I can. They are always on time and are extremely Thorough with their cleaning. The solution they use to clean works great and is not harsh at all. I have kids with skin and air allergies and they are fine playing on the carpet after it is done. Also their pricing is fantastic.
