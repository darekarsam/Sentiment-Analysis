4	Was doing some last minute Halloween shopping for my Son.  He was looking for a specific mask that all of the kids are supposedly going to wear for Halloween and this was our 2nd stop.I've never been in a Spirit Halloween Store before and I was really impressed with it.  It had a ton of Halloween related products.....costumes, decorations, table clothes, utensils, you name it!  There are a ton of cool displays too (see pics).....it gives you some ideas of how you could setup your house for Halloween.  Too late for this year, but I might do something next year.My Son found his mask within 5 minutes...score!  Saved me a day of Halloween Store hopping and a tank of gas.Random notes - Everything in the store will be 50% off starting Nov 1st.  The women employees here were dressed very provocatively....was beginning to think I walked into a Strip Club, wonder if it's like that at all locations or just this one?Overall Value - Great.Will I return?  You can count on it.
3	Stopped in to grab some items for the annual haunted garage. Looked pretty well organized with plenty of inventory. I'm sure as it gets even closer to Halloween, it will resemble a disaster area. The staff was friendly and helpful when it came to finding certain things. The first thing I picked up was without a price on it, so I grabbed another one and another one and another one until I found one that was marked. I saw lots of items new for 2013 and got some great ideas. Made a few small purchases and will be making return trips to finalize the haunt. I didn't experience anything that would lift Spirit into the four star range, but it was defintely better than satisfactory.
4	I like the Halloween displays. Interesting selection of costumes and other items that are not found in similar stores. Would come back again.
