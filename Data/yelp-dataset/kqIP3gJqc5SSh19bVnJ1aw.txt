4	Ben & Jerry's is great, especially when they have free cone day during the summer time. Only downfall is the crazy line up that comes with it, so brace yourself. For hot summer days, it's ideal, especially if you're around Crescent street or taking a walk downtown and want to enjoy an icy, cool treat while you're at it. They have smoothies, brownies, cakes, ice cream by the scoop and ice cream by the tub. As you can see, you have a large variety of options to choose from, unfortunately Half Baked was discontinued (my all time favourite)... HOWEVER, you can recreate it by mixing chocolate chip cookie dough and chocolate fudge brownie. Yep, genius, I know!Sometimes the service is amateur, sometimes it's professional, it's really a hit or miss. But it's decent, so no big deal. You get your ice cream, pay the $3-5, and leave.
4	Not much to say, we all know and love BJ's ...and by that I mean Ben and Jerry's. Yeah, its a little more expensive than other places, but its pretty standard, you know what you are getting. Also, a nice downtown location as well makes it a perfect summer time treat while strolling along.
5	Delicious ice cream and an energetic staff.  This was a real treat!
4	We ate at Ben & Jerry's every day while in Montreal for the JazzFest 2 weeks ago.  The service is excellent. You get what you want. The ice cream, of course, is wonderful.  It was very romantic to take a stroll, get some ice-cream before going back to our hotel after a long day of being on the go.  The only thing I would recommend is that they be more attentive to wiping  down the outside tables and keeping the place tidy.  This location could be 5 stars. Can't wait to go back.
