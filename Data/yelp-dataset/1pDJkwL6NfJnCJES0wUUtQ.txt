5	We all have a favorite place to bank and so do I.  I love banking with Desert Schools.  My husband and I have been members for years.  I love the fact that their notary services are free.   I never feel like they are trying to rip me off as I have with Chase, Wells Fargo and other nation wide banking institutions.  The staff there is always helpful and I don't feel pressured to buy into any of their services.   If you are new to the area and need a bank I recommend Desert Schools over all the others.
4	I love this bank. glad they have so many locations, especially finding them in the wal-marts. This branch isn't favorite but I don't mind stopping in to take care of business
1	Horrible Customer Service!
4	Would have a 5, because 99% of the employees here are PHENOMENAL!  One person either has a bad day, stereotypes, doesn't like their job, etc and boy oh boy can you tell. I don't know name names, "those" kind of people usually weed themselves out. Good vibes people. Relax,  it could be worse.
5	Two years of using this location and no problems. They move those lines! Friendly.  In particular we love Jesse Silva who has assisted us twice in opening accounts and a recent loan. Such a doll and makes it fun and painless.
