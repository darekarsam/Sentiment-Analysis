5	Great location, nice clean inside with a lot of merchandise to offer.
4	Nice station. Always clean, with very friendly staff. My husband regularly stops here for coffee and a snack on his way to work. They have a car wash, and there is a Redbox out front. PLEASE be careful pulling in and out of this location, however. The entrance drive is just not wide enough, and people turn in and out fairly far toward the middle. This leaves you open to being hit even if you are actually in your lane. Just a heads up.
3	Not much to say here, it's pretty similar to other Circle K's with a few exceptions. It never seems to be well staffed, lines can get pretty long with some overwhelmed looking clerks. Oh yeah, and that dangerous exit/entrance. It might work it this was Europe and everybody was driving Ford Ka's. Whomever designed this is obviously not very well endowed.
