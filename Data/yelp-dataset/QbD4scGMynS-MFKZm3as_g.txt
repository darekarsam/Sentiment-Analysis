1	The Coke guy there is a total horse's ass. I would never let him represent me and discourage everyone I know from having any dealings with him.
1	I totally agree with the previous review.  Stay away from that Coke guy at this firm!  He leaves a very bad taste for this firm!!!  You are better going to another firm who will not harass you.
5	Sandra Bazak is an amazing realtor. She was very friendly and very patient with me in my house buying. I would highly suggest her to anyone and everyone.
