4	Pretty decent breakfast, pretty good service, solid neighborhood diner. I would recommend this Hanlon's for a quick breakfast.
4	I work close by and am always looking for new places to eat lunch. I discovered Hanlon's recently and it immediately became a favorite! The staff is so nice, friendly, and helpful. The wait is never long for food, and it's always great. They make everything from scratch and it has a real home-cooked taste. I am partial to the tuna melt, but the stuffed cabbage special is also delicious! I would definitely recommend eating here for a quick tasty bite!
4	The food is pretty great diner food.  However, the last time I was here the waitress whistled along to the song "Pumped up Kicks".  I now hope it gets struck by a meteorite.
5	Went with my son for a nice lunch out. Pleasantly surprised. Modest dinner with a somewhat limited menu, but the soup (wedding) was excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed my pulled pork sandwich. My son also enjoyed his wedding soup and sandwich and loved the milkshake he had for dessert. Service was very friendly--as we're the other dinners. When I asked our server what the soup was, a gentleman in the next booth turned around and recommended the wedding soup--said it was the best he'd had. We'll be back.
5	Great, local diner near my work, I often go there for lunch. Hanlon's is not a fancy place, but the food is good and fresh, and won't break your wallet. Plus, the service is fast and super friendly. Can't beat all that! My favorite, go-to menu items include the amazing, cheesy and not-too-salty French Onion Soup, the sharable Tuna and Patty Melts and the burgers, the Duquesne is my usual, but I don't think you'd go wrong with any of 'em. If you're looking for a quick, tasty and enjoyable dining experience, hit Hanlon's up!
4	Good family dining and friendly service. Fresh food. Excellent breakfast. Not too expensive. Patronize a family place instead of a chain!
