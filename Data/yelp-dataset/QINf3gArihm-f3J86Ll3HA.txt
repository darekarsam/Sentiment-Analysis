Sally has skills and experience that resulted in the best Salon appt my woman has ever had. She is going to be a regular!
5	Sally helped me in in doing two brides hair for a bridal photoshoot. She was wonderful to work with (their hair turned out amazing!) and the brides looked great for their pictures! Sally not only did their hair but also came with us on the photoshoot to make sure the brides hair looked great for all locations and photos! The brides were really happy with the outcome of their hair and Sally's work! Thank you Sally for a great day and for your wonderful talent you shared with us!
