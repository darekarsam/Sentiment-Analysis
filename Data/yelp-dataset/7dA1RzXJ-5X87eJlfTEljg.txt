2	Line moves fast,  no free water.  That makes it a wash for me especially in Vegas! ;)
4	I'm mainly reviewing this place because I think they're current 2* is a bit unfair.It's what subway is; same deals, same prices and same taste. Everything met my expectations, and it was all really good. No free water is unfortunate; that's about as negative as it gets! Everything's fresh and nice.
2	Employees seemed completely out of it and confused by their jobs.  Asked what sandwich I wanted 3x after I told her.  Seemed to be really exhausted or on drugs.  Coke machine was out of Coke but I wasn't about to wait an hour while they refilled it.Overall, a poor Subway.
