5	I have worked with the Simmons Team on a professional level for a number of years and have always enjoyed my relationship that I have with Dianne and Justin Simmons.  I have always heard really good reviews from their clients so when it came time for me to short sell my house, it was an easy decision to choose them to represent me.  There were a number of tricky elements to this transaction that required a highly skilled professional to navigate the waters and negotiate the terms for my best benefit.  They did a fantastic job working with both the 1st and 2nd mortgage lenders and helping them to understand why it would be beneficial to them to get the deal done as proposed and in the end, the deal was closed far above and beyond my satisfaction.  I would strongly recommend using the Simmons Team to represent you either in a short sale or if you are looking to buy a home - you will be very happy with your choice.
5	Simmons Team Vegas helped us through a very difficult short sale purchase. The listing agent was not very cooperative or knowledgeable on how to negotiate a short sale. We almost lost the house. Without Dianne's involvement and expertise we probably would not have closed the deal. The best part is Dianne & Justin just informed us that our house has increased in value since we became homeowners!
5	As an residential designer I wanted to purchase a home to remodel and resell. However, since I needed to use financing I kept getting outbid by cash investors. Justin kept encouraging me and never gave up. We wrote 18 offers before we got one accepted! Finally, my patience was rewarded! We have now sold house #1 and are shopping for my next investment
