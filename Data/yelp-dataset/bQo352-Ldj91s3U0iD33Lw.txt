1	DO NOT leave these people with your clothes!! I made the mistake of going back before they lost my clothes and stated their policy is to pay 5 times the amount of cleaning which is 2$!! They gave me $10 for my expensive button up shirts they lost. I brought in receipts and they still would not reimburse me for the brand new shirts. Very unprofessional, how do you lose someone's clothes?
5	I decided to give this place a try because I live across the street, my husband gave me some clothes to dry clean. I had 3 shirts and a pair of pants. 20$ a little pricey, but I don't mind paying more if the job is done right. So today was pick up day, which I totally spaced and forgot,  my hubby was upset because he wanted to wear one of the shirts tonight. So I call at 8pm, a man answers the phone. I ask "are you open? " he laughs and says "no, but what do you need" I explained to him I missed my pick up time at 4pm. He told me "how far are you?" I answered "not even 2 min away!" So he tells me to come by. Staff has been super friendly from start to finish & my dry cleaning looks amazing.  I can't thank them enough for going above and beyond for me, it means so much. I will continue to go here again and again, can't put a price on 5 star service!!! I love these guys!!!!!
