3	Food is amazing. Fresh, made to order and good prices. Service is subpar at  best. Not sure if the lady owns the place or is a cashier but I have been back several times for the food and she manages to be rude, short and irritated every time.
5	Love the variety and freshness of the ingredients! Very good for those dieting because its all healthy foods. You cannot get these types of wraps anywhere else!
