3	Out of pure convenience, this is where I always take my car when I'm feeling too lazy to put in the effort to manually wash my car. It does a good enough job if your car just needs a light wash, but don't expect heavier grime (bird poop, specifically) to come off. For a heavier wash, you're better off doing it the old fashioned way, otherwise, you'll feel like you just wasted your $10-12.
2	I pulled into the laser wash tonight to get all the salt off my car, and I wasn't the only one who had the same idea. The pressure of the wash was just fine as far as I am concerned. However if I am going to pay $10 for a car wash, I expect to have my car dried as well and for $10 you do not have that luxury at this location.
