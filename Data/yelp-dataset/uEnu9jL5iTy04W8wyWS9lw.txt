4	NOW OPEN. Same location as Sushi Shop -- in a shared cafeteria. Place is very clean. Food is fresh and delicious. Had the tom yum soup. Very large portion; healthy, tasty and well priced. This location is new, but not easy to find. It's just off Decarie (Autoroute 15 S) adjacent to the Walmart parking lot. It is a small place, cafeteria style, in the same building as Sushi Shop. Very good choice for a budget-conscious traveler, for lunch or dinner. Please note, this place closes early (weeknights at 8 PM).
1	I don't understand why this place is multiplying all around the city. The food is really poor. Noodle dishes are mostly noodles and oil. Rice dishes have the same sauce. pad Thai has very little but noodles. Save your money.
