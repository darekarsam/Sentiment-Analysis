3	I have been to this location often and overall not the best bank around. I also don't think it bad the service was good and I got the proper help. I don't like the location do to the traffic that gets backed up makes it hard to get in and out of the bank. It is also in a shopping center so you get traffic from all the other places around.
5	My second visit. I came in because my temp card expired and I haven't received my actual card yet. There was a long line and Dina helped us less than a min we arrived. We are highly satisfied with customers service THANK YOU DINA. Very professional and she scheduled a follow up for herself to call to make sure my card arrive in two weeks. Excellent service!
2	This bank yes constantly understaffed. The lines are always long and they don't have enough people working. To make a simple deposit can take 20 to 30 minutes. We are highly considering moving our money to another bank.
