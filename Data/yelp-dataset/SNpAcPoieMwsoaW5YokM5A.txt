1	I had my brand new 2014 Mazda 6  car tinted here and I must say that the tint job was not "amazing." Lots of bubbling, messed up my plastics on one side and the attention to  detail was horrible. The owner is a very nice guy but that does not excuse him from the bad job.He did try to correct some of the problems like when he burned the plastic on one side of my window panels but I still had to come back with other issues that needed fixing. Its just not worth it.  Also the HID that I had installed by him had multiple issues just like the tint. Shell out the cash because you do get what you pay for.
5	Sainz did an amazing job on my window tinting. The owner was very detail-oriented and answered all my questions. Plus, the price was right! I can see why people complain about seeing bubbles when they first get their car, but it's because it takes time for tint to cure. I noticed the bubbles on my car too, but they went away in a week. I would suggest waiting at least a week and a half before you wash or put down your windows. Other than that, I would highly recommend this place.
4	Great job. The only issue was they were a tad bit slow, but very pleased with the job they did.
5	I took my car to get the windows tinted at first, Pedro the owner is a very cool guy, did an amazing job, very friendly. I have been coming back to him for other paint work ever since. Awesome prices highly recommended!
