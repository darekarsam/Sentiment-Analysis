3	This is a good Office Depot.  You have a lot of good employees asking you at every turn if you need any help.  Lucky for them I really was just browsing.  I found my mechanical pencils and moved on. On a side note, Christopher Lowell is one of the seven signs of the design apocalypse.  His bald head is plastered all around this store.  Heed my warnings, not only is he EVIL but he CANNOT design his way out of a coloring book!
4	Though only an occasional customer, this Office Depot has saved my butt a couple times. The first time was when I needed a very specific copy job done very quickly. The associate who helped me was helpful and did a nice job. More recently, I desperately needed to return an online purchase. The UPS Store near my workplace closes daily at 6:30pm and has limited weekend hours. However, the UPS Alliance location inside this Office Depot is open until 9pm Monday-Saturday and 6pm Sunday. So useful!
1	I went there the other night. Nobody wanna help. Even when I finally got somebody to help, he did not no anything and gave me wrong answers. Finally, I wanted to buy a wide format printer, they did not have any in the stock. They kept saying we will have shipped to your address. Hint if I wanted it shipped I wouldn't have been here. I will never go back again.
