5	The staff here is so incredibly helpful! I called Auto Zone to ask whether or not they carry a specific nut (gave them size and everything) and they refused to tell me on the phone. They were telling me I had to bring my car in just to let me know if they have the nut... I called O'Reilly, they not only had it but they even helped me install it on my car battery. I'll never go to Auto Zone again. O'Reilly all the way now.
5	New in town and went to this O'Reilly's location looking for a window motor. Everyone was super polite, knowledagble and provided the right part the first time. Thanks guys and gals, will be doing business again.
3	I came for some motor oil and anti-freeze. O'Reilly's delivered. They had a decent enough selection of various types and brands including their own name brand which was a bit cheaper than the rest. You can even ask the friendly staff for a suggestion on which type of oil to put in your specific car.After getting in line to check-out, I was quickly helped. This store delivers exactly what you would need from it and exactly what you would expect. No disappointment here.
