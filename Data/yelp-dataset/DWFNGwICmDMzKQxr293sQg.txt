5	We worked with sales rep Ryan Rippchen and were very pleased with our experience. Straightforward, no high-pressure sales tactics, and a great guy to boot! We would definitely buy from him and this dealership again.
5	I had a great experience working with Dennis Riddle. I knew I wanted a Subaru for the quality of the AWD, but wasn't sure between Impreza, Crosstrek, and Forester what would give the best balance of comfort, performance, efficiency, and cargo space. Dennis very patiently helped me test out an Impreza, a Forester, and both the gas and hybrid Crosstrek models while talking through the differences and his past personal experiences with the ones that he'd owned. The experience was extremely pleasant - Dennis was clearly interested in getting me into the car that best fit my needs and was never pushy or salesy, even though it was a busy Saturday. My experience with Dennis was definitely a refreshing change from the usual high-pressure sales barrage of car shopping.
5	I have always had an amazing experience coming to this dealership. I always feel that the service reps taking their time helping with any issue at hand. In the past I've worked with Kevin and Rick who are both and knowledgeable and kind when checking in for service. I picked up an Impreza a few years back and since then it has been running smooth and is just a great, comfortable car to drive. I would recommend this dealership to anyone who has a Subaru and is looking to have it serviced on the west side of town.
