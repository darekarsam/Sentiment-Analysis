5	My Wife and I were at a nice resort in Mesa, AZ last week and were looking for a a great massage.  We found a team that came into our room, set up two tables and provided one of the best massages that we both had.  With back problems, it is important to get exceptional massage. This team is the best!!
5	I'm writing this review moments after receiving the best therapeutic massage I have ever had.  This is what a massage is supposed to be.  I'm an Iraqi Freedom veteran who was injured and Lucas is a God send.  I feel great after being treated by him.  Not only do I feel better and relaxed after a session with him, I also feel revitalized.  Don't waste your time or money on fancy spas and light touch amateurs.  If you want a truly professional and beneficial massage, call Lucas or his partner Cori.  These two are passionate about helping people to feel better.  There is no reason for anyone to feel stiffness or pain.  If I could give them 10 stars I would.  Give them a try.  Lucas has strong hands so be prepared to have your muscled stretched and kneaded.  Believe me, your body will thank you.  Very professional and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire session.  Additionally, them coming out to my home is convenient and allows me to continue relaxing after a nice shower.
4	Heres the deal.. I moved to Scottsdale from LA two days ago and  in LA a good massage shop was available on almost every block, moving here I found most are fancy day spas, where they push some oil around on your body and that is it.  I am really "picky" about my massage experience...with that being said, Kat was amazing.   I usually get a Thai which has stronger pressure so that is why the 4 stars.  Clean and serene, but very, very nice.  I bought a deal on yelp which was $50 for 1 1/2 hr, yeah YELP for helping me find Kat.
