5	5.9 euros (tax included) for their daily lunch special is a really good deal. The food is simple but well-prepared and lightly seasoned. It's very pleasant to sit outdoors - either by the sidewalk or across the street next to a small fountain. I've heard good things about their home-brewed beer as well.
5	Excellent food & Excellent beer! What more can I ask for?.... Oh yes friendly staff, they have that covered too. Perfect!
