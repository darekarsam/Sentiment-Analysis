2	I LOVE the Ferragamo brand, the quality, the fit. There isn't anything I don't love about the products but this particular store falls short. It is over-lit for one thing. I felt a need for dark glasses in there. Products are displayed in a very sterile manner which left me thinking, "Is this all they've got? Just a lesson, look at your San Diego/Fashion Valley store, compare and then fix the problems at the Scottsdale store. The one thing which really put me off was the two rather young sales girls which were literally perched just inside the store like vultures on a perch, waiting. This reminded me of the old Westward Pontiac in Phoenix (North 7th Street and Highland, a block south of Camelback). There they had the showroom up on a raised platform several feet above the parking lot. In front of it they had a metal railing where salesmen would hang out, literally like perched vultures waiting to fly off and swoop down on a customer. The two girls at Ferragamo brought back that vivid memory. Give the brand the respect it deserves. Don't let your sales girls stand there eyeballing people as they walk by. It's creepy. It's intimidating. It really put me off. Dim the lights and get more product in the store. I go there to buy really fine shoes, not to look at the latest in commercial wall light sconces. Ferragamo is SO much better than the impression this store leaves. I headed to Nordstrom to see Ferragamo stuff. Then again, it's Scottsdale. Without a certain amount of tacky, things don't fit.
5	Simply put, they got the message. The staff was not only better trained but genuinely engaging, helpful and fun. That's the Ferragamo image and it's great to be able to upgrade this fine store!
