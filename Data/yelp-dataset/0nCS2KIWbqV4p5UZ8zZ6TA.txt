4	Firehouse subs are always good.  Excellent good service at this location.
4	I love me some Firehouse Subs!! What's not to love, fresh well portioned tasty sandwiches served up by a friendly staff.I have been going to Firehouse Subs for years and have tried pretty much everything on the menu many times...never a disappointment.I love the hot sauce selection so much, but I swear I love their house sauce the best. I keep some at home at all times and use it in many recipes.Bottom line.....consistent goodness, a great place to fill the belly.
4	The food is really good but the service could be better. .. this is one of my favorite places to dine...
3	Nothing to write home about. The sub, which radio advertisements guarantee to be the best you've ever had or your money back, can easily be compared to the taste of the subway equivalent.  Though this one did look nicer, it wasn't worth the extra 6 bucks.  They've got the drink machine with a bunch of options (200+) , cool if you're into that.
