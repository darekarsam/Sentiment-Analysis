4	I'm not a huge fan of gas stations in general, but this place is quite lovely!The owner is a nice Indian man, and basically is always there. He is constantly cracking jokes, mostly at the expense of the cashiers, sometimes the customers. The selection of stuff here is pretty solid, and covers some of the finer goods that one may not expect from a gas station. For example, bananas, string cheese, coconut water, protein shakes, and even personal pan pizzas! Make sure you give everything a good look before getting something regrettable like potato chips :)
3	Eh, what do you want from them, really?  It's a gas station... On the upside, though, this one is attached to a Subway ... So if you don't want to pay the extra $3 for chips and a drink, you can walk right into the store from the restaurant and pick up a .50 bag of snacks...
3	I agree with Michelle P., its just a gas station.Nothing fancy, no perks but it gets the job done. It is nice at it connected to a Subway, the Yorkmont deli and a cleaners.Only bad part is it's tricky to get out! So be careful!
