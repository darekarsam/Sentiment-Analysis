4	I received excellent customer service from this particular Petland.  I was approached by a friendly and knowledgeable salesperson who asked if I needed assistance, which I did.  I was looking for a particular cat food brand which they didn't carry but he offered to order it for me.  I opted instead to ask about other brands; he offered up what he used for his cats and told me about some others, as well (and I subsequently purchased).  He even gave me samples of a premium brand to try.  You can't ask for any more service that what he gave.  Top notch in my book!Oh, his name was Reggie!  Many kudos to him!
5	Being the crazy-dog mom that I am, it's about time I write a review on what I can undoubtedly say is the best pet store within the city limits.  The staff are pet-owners themselves, very knowledgeable, and super-friendly.  They carry products that I haven't been able to find at the Big Box pet stores, such as Blue dog food and Zuke's treats.  I've also found their prices to be comparable and sometimes lower than the Big Box stores.  I always get great coupons to use there in the Clipper Magazine, making it even more affordable.Petland is chain, but locally owned and operated.  All the animals housed there are from area shelters, which is great!  If you are a 'Burgh Pet Mom or Dad, check out Petland for sure!
4	This is my preferred pet store when I'm not buying anything heavy (I walk everywhere so I have to get my litter and food from Big Box stores).  Petland has comparable or better prices for cat supplies compared to the Big Box stores.  Anytime I had a question or needed help finding something, the staff was accessible and knowledgeable--I like that I didn't have to search very far for a staff member or have to poke around looking for the correct supplements.
