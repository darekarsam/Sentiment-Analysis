5	Gutes Bier und gutes Essen.
4	Try the unfiltered beer for sure. The food was very good. Very friendly folks. Nice when traveling to Germany . Be sure to drop in.
4	Nice place? Sunday night Bundesliga crowd. Had their Helles, very nice. Food was good had the Biermeister platte and Obatzda cheese platter app. Reasonable. Will go back but will look for another German food place nearby first.
4	Best German food I've ever had!  I can't remember the names of all the food, but I got to sample several different dishes.  The schnitzel was amazing.  It had a malt crust on the outside that gave an extra crunch. I was pretty lucky to experience my first public viewing while I dined here.  Crowds of people had gathered to watch the Germany vs. Netherlands match.  High fives were flying all around, and people were "prosting" each other.  Great fun!Waitress was pretty quick but was unfriendly when we asked for a separate bill.  She made a face and later pushed past my friend without apologizing.  Perhaps it's not customary to ask for another bill, but I think the waitress could've been nicer about it.  Maybe she was in a pissy mood.Service 4Ambience 5Food 5
4	The menu was very limited but had some good German food choices on one side and several vegetarian options on the back.  There were about 5 standard meal option and 5 vegetarian options that were available for one week then they are changed. I had the Gulasch/Wurst/knudel  (13.90 euro), everything was good but the Gulasch was particularly tasty and tender (this is a meat stewed in a gravy, not what Americans might think of as gulash). The Knudel (potato dumpling) was lightly herbed and very good. Plenty of food for a hungry guy. I also had two large mugs of their seasonal beer, "Nikolausbrau". It was somewhat dark, unfiltered and went great with my food. My wife had the Schweinensnitzel/Pommes plate (9 euro) and a coke. The schnitzel portion was large and had a very light but crunchy crust. Bill total was 30 euro.
