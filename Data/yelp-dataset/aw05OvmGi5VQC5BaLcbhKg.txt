5	So glad I went to him my immigration process! Very professional and easy to work with. They helped my daughter and her husband in his immigration process and they were so happy with the results! If he helped my daughter I knew it would be the same for me and IT WAS! couldn't be any more happy!
5	I would recommend Mr Athari and his office every day. He has done work for family and friends with great outcomes. He works hard for you and believes in you. He is professions, courteous, and experienced so he knows what he's doing. He's a great attorney!
1	STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He's awful, some of the staff is friendly but other than that they have one purpose which is to get you in, get your money, get you out and on to the next client! I work for an Attorney as well and i can tell you this is not a good firm, they are focused more on the volume of cases not the actual cases. I would not recommend this firm at all.
