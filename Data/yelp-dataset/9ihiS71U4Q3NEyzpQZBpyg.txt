4	Good Service.   The women are veroy friendly and on time.  Would recommend this business
1	The cleaning visits got shorter and shorter each month they came out, they went from a cleaning crew of 3 to only 2 and left basic things dirty; my TV Stand dusty, the toilets barely wiped and the shower grimey. They are cheap but you're house doesn't even get cleaned.
1	2 hours late and dragged me along every 30 minutes saying they were 5 minutes away. I came home from work for the cleaning and they had no decency to be on time or let me know their real schedule so I could work around mine. Undependable  and terrible. Would never use them again.
