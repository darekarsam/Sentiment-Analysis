1	Nastyyy calzone!!!! Do not go there!!! I had to throw out my food!!!!
1	well, it may look like a pizza but doesn't taste like one. it doesn't even deserve one star. when you have to dunk it in some tomato sauce or if really lazy, ketchup to get some sort of flavor on it, you know its bad. and i'm not even talking about cold pizza. here.crust tasted like cardboard, whatever sauce you have taste like water, barely any meat but they are generous on bell peppers and mushrooms though. as for the cheese, you're going to get weird bowel movement. suffer from constipation? eat a slice and you'll be cure!now, you're wondering why i eat here? when the family loves it, you don't have much of a say, sadly!i think the place is halal but i don't give a flying fuck that is halal, kosher, vegan, whatever. if its bad, its bad!anyway, you're better off making your own! its just water, flour and yeast and salt
1	Never again. We got two larges, one Hawaiian and one meat,  it cost us $50. I've never paid that much for two pies ever so we expected to be  amazed. The only amazing thing about any of this is that these people have the audacity to serve this. Both were thrown out after a bite of each, this is absolute garbage. It should be called 'Double Price' and they are CHEAP with the toppings. We could literally see the crust through the pizza. Garbage, slim toppings, crust that tasted like paper and the whole thing had a very nasty odor.A "proud Quebec product" indeed. I want my money back, you can keep the vomit sauce.
