4	Good location, but not really accessible if you're headed East on Elliot.Parking lot is often full and parking is limited.Good, fresh coffee.Store typically clean and fairly busy too.
4	I am here almost daily. I walk here all the time and this store helps me gain weight. The 79. sodas is what really gets me all the time. LOVE IT!
4	The people who work here are friendly and the soda fountain is always on point. I can't say the same for other locations.
3	I like the convenience of this location. It is in a good spot and easy to access from Elliot or Hardy. They also always have fresh coffee already when I am there.The reason for the 3 star is that it is a crowded interior, and not as up to date as other locations I have visited. It's ok from a selection standpoint, but could use some renovation to make the interior more appealing.
