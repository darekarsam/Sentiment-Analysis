2	Business lunch, came here with a work colleague.  We both ordered the hot chicken sandwich with salad bar.  It had no flavour at all!  He took two bites and stopped and I ate half of it (cause my mom taught me to not waste food).  Salad bar is mehhh.  Service was good but I'm just not a fan of this restaurant chain!  It reeks of plain jane normal!
