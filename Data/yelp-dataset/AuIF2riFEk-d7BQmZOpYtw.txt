4	While i've really only explored half of what this park has to offer, i'm a fan. There are like 10 sand volleyball courts and it's the site of the volleyball leagues through Sportslink. There are also a number of tennis courts, a solid disc golf course (probably too challenging for a beginner), and some soccer fields.  Of course they could use more sand and better nets blocking the ball from going into the woods, but overall, it's a good number of courts and fun competition.
5	Fantastic trail running.  The running trails have one ~4 mile loop and another ~6 mile loop. Lots of up-and-down hills (which makes it a good spot for mountain biking as well).I stumbled across a few disc golf courses while I was there and they seemed pretty well set up (me + frisbee = no.).Safe, clean and a decent amount of parking. Softball/baseball fields and tennis courts are offset on opposite sides of the park.This is totally my new running spot to frequent.
5	I found out about this park from Run for Your Life and have been pretty stoked on it since a friend and I went the other day for a run. This is the first place I've found where I can run and barely hear traffic and not have to worry about getting hit by a car. It's nice to focus on just the run and some roots. So, big ups to the Mtn. biker's that put together these trails. Besides great trails for runners and biker's. It has Tennis courts, Beach Volleyball. Disc Golf(?), and Baseball fields. I can imagine in the winter plenty of sledding to be had too!If you like getting away and getting into some woods without the drive. Then this is your place.
