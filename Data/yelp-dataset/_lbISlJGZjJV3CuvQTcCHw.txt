5	Every time I just walk in and never have to wait. Love this place. They all do a great job whether on my nails or my feet!!
5	I have been going to Pauline's nail salon every 2-3 weeks since September of 2012 and have recently decided to write reviews on yelp, so I figured I would write them a review. I have never had a bad pedicure, they are a little higher priced that their competitors but totally worth it! I have recommended them to several of my friends and they have all had a pleasant experience and have traded in their prior salon for this one. I have also had a gel manicure, I like them best because I am rough with my hands. The manicure was good, but the gel didn't last as long as others I have had. I think it was applied a little to thick. But overall I was still pleased with it. I recommend giving them a try, go for the Celebrity Pedicure - You won't be disappointed!! Enjoy :)
5	My husband and I and two of our friends recently had a pedicure and I have to say this was the best pedicure I've ever had and the people that work there are fun!  The shop is nice and clean....I will definitely be going back!!
1	Do not go to paulenes nails, unprofessionalDirty, the worst service ever, this place should be closed I can't believe this place exist in the nails business.
