4	Loblaws is a humongous supermarket. My favorite thing I saw was the "No Name" brand - Warhol would love that stuff http://www.flickr.com/photos/orlick/5985641343The quality isn't necessarily great, but it's fun to see supermarkets in another country.
4	Shop here often, though the do have more choices at the one on Cavendish, but that's not as convenient. They have a rolling cart of expired or near expired food at 50% off, but careful with the dates. Lately the barbecue chicken has tipped the price mark (considering that it's $7.49 at Costco). Architecturally, this particular branch is built into one of the buildings from the Angus Train Yards. Equipment for the movement of engines are still located in the building and you can see them. They used to have a train sound in the far corner near the milk, but it seems to have disappeared over the years. The walls of the other parts of the factory are still intact and serve as dividers in the side parking lot.In the spring they open a large garden centre, where you can buy flowers, vegetables and plants.
