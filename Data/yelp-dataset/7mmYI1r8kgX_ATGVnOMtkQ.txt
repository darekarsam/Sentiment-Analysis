5	I selected Roadrunner after interviewing several other contractors, and I certainly made the right decision. Roadrunner remodeled two bathrooms and a kitchen in my 28 year old home. I received expert advice and ideas, and I was kept informed of every step along the way. Dan always showed up as planned and had great suggestions to address every problem. And his tile work is simply the best. Patrick is very organized and did his best to keep me on budget (always a challenge with me). In a job as big as mine, there are always a few loose ends. Roadrunner provided prompt and effective follow up on these even several months after the job was complete.I am so happy with my beautiful 'new' home. Thanks Roadrunner!
5	I met Patrick, the owner of Roadrunner Custom Remodeling, eight years ago when I joined the National Association of the Remodeling Industry. I found him to be proactive at helping other remodelers improve their businesses and a leader of the organization. He encouraged me to participate in leading the organization and has resulted in my personal and professional growth as an owner of another remodeling company. Over the years I have never known Patrick and Roadrunner Custom Remodeling to represent anything other that the most professional example of how our industry should perform. I don't think you will find a more honest and trustworthy person to work with remodeling your home.
