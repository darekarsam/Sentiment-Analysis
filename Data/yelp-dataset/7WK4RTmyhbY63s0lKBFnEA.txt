5	A veritable Al Baba's treasure trove; beautiful ceramics from  the far East, pashminas from India, beautiful ones, not the schlocky stuff one normally sees everywhere, lamps, carpets from North Africa, saris,bedspreads, curtains, hammocks, jewelry, and various knick knacks and decor items from the four corners of the world. I often come in here just to take a peek, sometimes just to spend some time browsing and enjoying one of my happy places. The prices are slightly on the higher side, but the goods are also  higher end. The owner is very pleasant and lets you just browse and enjoy ogling the mechandise without pressuring you to buy anything. This is the place to check out next time you feel like buying something special or different, and are happy to spend the extra  for something that's worth it.
4	Really neat hangers, knobs, earrings and middle eastern decor. I bought a pair of Mediterranean tiles for $22. they have flowy scarves too! Lady is friendly :)
