5	Went to JB's on their opening day (was still putting the interior sign up).  They had 13 different varieties of jerky of which you could try most out.  They had a jar of "jerky shots", little bags of bite sized chunks to try.  They have a flavor called Cave Man which is a very basic, minimalist marinade.  It turned out to be one of my favorites and they base several of the varieties on it (like the red pepper and the cracked pepper).  I also tried the BBQ jerky which has a nice tomato sweetness to it.  They also have some spicier jerky for people that think the pepper varieties are too mild.  All the jerky has a fairly strong smoke flavor thanks to their giant smoking machine in the back.  This isn't the cheap, blah stuff you find at the convenience store.  The prices are good too.  A decent sized bag will run you 8 bucks flat.  For a place that is doing it all in house AND smoking it too that is a good deal.  I will be going back again to pick up my next fix.

The flavors are magnificent, and all have a smoky overlay that speaks of it's quality. The Caveman is currently my favorite.The atmosphere is minimalist, service is great and you can really tell this is a family business. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.
5	I discovered this gem about a week ago and I am hooked,  I just got done getting more. They are locally owned and family run. They smoke all the jerky on site. When I walked in i was greeted and offered samples to try to help see what I liked. My favorites right now are the black pepper teriyaki and the green chili, crazy good. If you love good jerky and great customer service this is the only place to go in vegas
