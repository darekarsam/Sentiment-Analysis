5	This place is great!  It's a small, quiet salon with an awesome decor and atmosphere.  You have to know where it is located, as this is one of those hidden gems in the valley.  Nancy there has been my stylist for years now and she always does an amazing job!  I highly recommend this place!!!!!

My facial was great and my face feels wonderful.  I will definitely be returning soon. She really makes that personal connection with her clientele and offers the best customer experience.I loved this place and the best thing is that it is owned by her and therfore, it is very important to her that her customers come out happy with their service and satisfied.   You definitely have to check her out for any kind of spa service needed.This is a little hidden place in a quiet calm location. It is one of those places that you are glad you found! Thank you so much for the wonderful experience Mary!
5	A long overdue recommendation for Geron at Salon Vanityz.  You know how usually a stylist is good at color or good with a cut?  Well Geron is great at both.  PLUS, he genuinely cares about his clients and wants them to have a good experience and love their hair.  I usually come in with a picture and Geron spends lots of time asking me questions and making recommendations until he believe we are on the same page.  But, during my las visit, HE had a haircut picture he recommended.  The cut was great and he was right on the money with what I wanted to fit my lifestyle.  On top of all that Geron is just so nice!
