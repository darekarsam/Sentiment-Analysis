5	OH MY GASH!  In all this time I have never written a review to Thunderbird.   My mother before had been using Thunderbird for a few years, I figure from shortly after they opened.  I have been going to Thunderbird sense 1987.  They have saved me money, a lot of money.  Thru preventative maintenance, advise when asked, and only doing work that is needed.  They know me as a customer, understand my needs of not doing un-necessary work, but because I enjoy not breaking down.  My present Truck is about 17 yrs old.  I have been told by everyone "what a great truck, it never breaks down".   WRONG, I always ask they to check it over for ware and tare.  Most of the time they find things that will need attention, but I have time.  When I can I take care of it.  Bushings ware out, fix before it breaks, much cheaper.  On the other hand my last truck had 10,000 miles, and burped occasionally.  They thought they knew what was wrong, but to fix it they would be very expensive.  They suggested if it gets bad they will take care of it, 100,000 miles later, it was still the same.  I never fixed it.  I have always been happy with them, if something they did was not right they fixed it, it happens, at no extra charge.   The only time I can think of is a part that they bought was a bad part.
