1	Great sushi, but poor service. Twice, I went there, ordered sushis, and afterward asked for an extra soya sauce. They told me it's 50 cents. I only have my credit card and minimum payment is 5$. They didn't want to give it for free. Well, they sure lost a customer! Even when I told them I will not come back, they just smiled at me and said "sorry". They lost a customer over 50 cents I was willing to pay, but couldn't...
5	Really, really good. I'm pretty fussy about sushi, and this place really surprised me. It's actually some of the best sushi and sashimi I've had anywhere in eastern Canada. wtf? Really nice service too. Yum.
