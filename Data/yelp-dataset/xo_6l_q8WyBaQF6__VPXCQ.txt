4	Super nice employees.  One race is about 3 laps and is $8.  Cars are fast and fun.
2	I purchased a groupon for this place and recently visited with my son for day of fun....or so I thought.  There are race cars for kids and adults, a slide, a cable jump, and a cage climber.  I have a serious problem with wait times...We stood in line for the cable jump almost an hour and it wasn't crazy lines or anything it just took forever....the race cars for the kids had 6 cars on the track but for some reason they only allowed 2 cars to operate even though the other cars were working and the line was insane so another hour in that line....needless to say, this place is not worth the time or the discount.
3	Came here with intention of racing karts only,  and overall satisfactory experience. Biggest complaint is that on all tracks, the max speed of each kart was very different. We were a group of five, including my son's first time on go karts, and there were always a couple of us with much slower max speed than everyone else. If real competition vs. just the experience is what you are after, try the more advanced types of facilities. Great place though for first time racers.No worries about safety, staff was observant. We were there early in AM so we could have the tracks pretty much to ourselves. $20 per person for 4 runs. I think we got to go a little longer than usual ( just a guess), so that made it doubly worth it.Would recommend for young teams and up.
