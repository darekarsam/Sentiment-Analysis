5	Such cute clothes for little girls and you better believe it,  if I was tiny enough I would have bought 20 pairs of  pants for myself! Lol... went here with one of my bf and her two beautiful daughters. When I have a daughter of my own,  this store is what she'll be wearing! :)
5	The sales girls were very helpful with very positive attitudes!!  I was very impressed with their bright cheery personalities!!  They made the shopping experience for school clothes a breeze.  Priced very well with the great quality Justice is known for.  We will return.
