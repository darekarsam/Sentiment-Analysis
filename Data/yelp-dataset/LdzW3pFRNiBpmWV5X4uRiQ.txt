5	I brought my kids in to see Rob for the acne they get from their sweaty helmets. Dr. Rob knew exactly what to tell my boys so they would take care of their skin and use what he gave them. I really don't want them to get acne scars so treating it was really important to me. Thanks Rob!
5	Dr. Rob is great!!  He was able to get my sister in to see him (she was visiting from out of town) at the last minute and was able to diagnose her problem in less than a minute.  She has already felt relief in less than 3 hours and we are so grateful.  His staff is super friendly and professional.  So glad that they are close by!!  Thanks Rob!!!
5	I was in Scottsdale on vacation and needed to get to a dermatologist fast.  The SCC of Scottsdale was very accommodating, professional and friendly.  Rob and his staff made time to see me in their schedule and saved my vacation.  Thank you so much!!!
2	I was looking for a professional to help with some skin conditions. The staff said all patients first see their physicians assistant before seeing the doctor, which was fine at first but when I finally got to be seen things went awry.,  First off the PA, Rob is very quick tempered, he got upset at me for asking a question, he cut me off in mid sentence and end up prescribing the wrong medication for me.  They gave me free samples which burned my skin.  Rob the PA did not have the time to settle me down before he carved a hole in my skin, he was very insensitive. I will not go back and see him, but will see the actual medical doctor & will update on the visit with the actual doctor who I am hoping has bedside manor which Rob the PA did not.  He was very unsympathetic and was in a hurry.
