5	I love Smoothie King!  It's always fresh, tasty and consistent.  I have tried making smoothies at home but they are never as perfect as Smoothie King.  They menu is pretty extensive for it to be a smoothie store.  You name it and they've got it for all of your nutritional wants and needs.  It's a must try!
5	Just like any other smoithieking, not going to write much because their is not much to say. If you need to get your smoothie on,  well this is the place for you.
1	This smoothie king is by far the worst I have ever been to. Horrible management. I am too dumbfounded to say anything more.  Made my day awful.  Thanks again, smoothie king!
