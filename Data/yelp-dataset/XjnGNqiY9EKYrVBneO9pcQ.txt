5	One of the few bars that are more or less rocking 7 days a week. You will always find people having fun here.Drinks are OK, nothing compared to L'Assomoire. Beer selection is large (i dont drink beer though). Tapas are cheap and very good. Location deserves additional mentioning. There are several bars not far, on the same street (Edgar, Distillerie, LaPorteRouge, Bily Kun, Plan B, etc) so its a perfect spot to start your pub crawl in the French area of Montreal.
5	Best place we went to in Montreal.Tapas were delicious, music was awesome (crazy, funky, old-school hip hop), crowd was having fun and they had drink specials on a Saturday night.We got the bowl of olives, patatas bravas, croquettes and bacon wrapped dates... everything was great!The other thing to note is this area on Mont Royal was really cool because it felt more local, as opposed to St. Laurent which had a ton of tourists. Extra bonus that we really liked!Plus, outdoor patio w/ heaters for smokers. Looks like it would be a lovely patio to eat & drink outside, but we were there in November ;-)
1	Not very impressed. Was expecting a proper tapas bar and we received flat beer and stale vodka that was watered down. We had to wait to be acknowledged because the staff were too busy socializing. Definitely wouldn't recommend this place during the week, nor to any tourist.  Q
5	Great beer. Great rhum. If you're looking for a place to relax and have a few drinks amongst friends this is it
4	Really nice place to go if you like Rum.Pretty good Mojito (one of the best I had in Montreal so far) Nice terrace in the back (or in front but pretty small)
