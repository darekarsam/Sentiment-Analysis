5	Joni is the owner and the stylist. He does bridal updos, make-up, bridal parties, proms, threading eyebrows, and the list goes on. I started going to him as a walk in to get my eyebrows done.  From the moment I meet him he treated me like family, as I see him interact with his other clients he treats them the same.I leave it up to him when I go get my hair dyed and styled. He always delivers perfection. Every time I don't think he could do any better he always outdoes himself.He also has a nail tech, her name is Nicole. She is just like him. Her work and personality are impeccable. I hope you would take my advice and go to see him and/or I Nicole  promise you will not be disappointed.

5	Joni does the best job with your eyebrows. He threads which I have a hard time of finding someone who is detailed enough but he does that perfect.
