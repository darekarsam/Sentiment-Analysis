3	I got "Jacked" at this Jack in the Box! Food is standard Jack fare but the service is slower than a Wisconsin snowbird. Only  fast food joint in North Scottsdale, though fast in category only. Oh, and don't plan on going in after 9:30 as they lock it up early.
3	Was in the area to meet someone and thought I would be able to find a quick bite to eat.....little did I know that this area is like BFE and that there's not much to choose from.  Luckily, I saw the good ol' standby when in a pinch....JITB.  I ordered:Turkey Bacon Cheddar Sandwich, $4.19http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Rq6WYcNMX8VZohD89LGWaQ?select=USHwj6fMp951mItyKyn0mAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Rq6WYcNMX8VZohD89LGWaQ?select=yNz93hcyNATY5XLlNlQcXQBig Cheeseburger, $1.29http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Rq6WYcNMX8VZohD89LGWaQ?select=B9ffEfEnx60oWFPx80_uKwThis was my 1st time trying the Turkey Bacon Cheddar.....thought I would try something "healthier" for a change....umm, not!  The Sandwich was pretty tasty, but damn was it greasy or buttery.....whatever, I felt really guilty after eating that thing.The Big Cheeseburger was ok....it's my staple grub at JITB.Overall, the joint was fast and food was cheap.  Not bad.Return Factor - 50%
3	The staff treated me okay.  There was a manager that served me breakfast who was WAY chipper for being there so early, but that is kind of a good thing I suppose.  Never been a big fan of JIB's burgers but I like their breakfasts.  Used to be a fan of the Chicken Fajita Pita ... Might I may have to try that again soon when I get a new job.....
5	Very friendly staff, or a fast food place-- their customer service and friendliness is unmatched.. I go more often than not simply because of the experience every time! Thanks Micky!
2	Over the years this place has gone down hill. I work third shift and this is the only place to eat at that's open 24 hours. If I had another choice, I would never visit this Jack again. Maybe it's better during the day but night shift workers are rude at times, get my order wrong 75% of the time and the wait time is ridiculous. I hope the owners read what their customers are saying because this location has some serious issues that need to be resolved.
