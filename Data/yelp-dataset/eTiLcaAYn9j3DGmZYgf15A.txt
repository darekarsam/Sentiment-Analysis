3	Came here while being at the pool and was hungry! I got a hotdog and a soda and my son got the burger. Took a long time to get our food from the time we ordered. The staff was very nice but thought the food was a little over priced for the flavor or lack there of. Will try this place again though.
4	Such nice folks, love the Cuban sandwich! Owners are super nice. Best place to order food when pool side at Starpointe. They also have great salads and a kid's menu. Big burgers and not overpriced. You can even get Popsicles for the hot summer days!
