2	The only reason I come here every now and then, is because it's close to our home. Otherwise, this place is known to mess up your drive-thru order.
3	A great place in the am and mid day.  At night the staff is rude and the place dirty.  It just seems like at night they are more interested in playing then the customer.
1	I only come to this location when I go to Nellis AFB and it's never that great. Customer service needs some help, two polite employees does not make up for ten rude ones unfortunately. It's a nightmare going inside and the time it's dirty. I prefer the drive-thru but I can sit there for ever saying hello and no one responds or I'll get a response to wait, not a please at all!!! That makes me kinda angry. I know some would not care but I've worked customer service before and it's not polite when you add a rude tone and attitude on top!!!I don't make it to breakfast often. It's been a long time since I've ordered an Egg McMuffin, so I indulged. I paid $1.19 drink upgrade for a large orange juice and I got a watered down juice so I went they the drive-thru and the lady was rude like I was the picky customer, I only want what I pay for and a little dash of politeness since they get paid for it!!!
