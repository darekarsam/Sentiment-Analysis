5	Words cannot explain how great the staff at cj dentistry are. Dr joh and his staff put you at ease and takes the time to understand your anxiety and apprehension. they know every trick in the book to make the appointment extremely enjoyable. and what i loved most is he speaks to you in terms you understand, not overly "clinical". Dr  Joh has such a warm personality and vast knowledge it is impossible not to enjoy your time with him. Even with his busy schedule he makes sure to be very thorough with your exam and takes the time to get to know you. He and his staff take the time to find a way to accommodate you as soon as possible. The assistants are knowledgeable and keep the appointment going smooth and help get you in and out on time. The entire staff takes their time to explain procedures, insurance coverage, billing statements and work their hardest to help you get the most out of your appointment. They are happy to show you many different options to meet your financial means. This dental office clearly has one concern and that is the health of your mouth! without question, I would recommend to all friends and family! this new, beautiful office is just the addition this plaza needed. very convenient. scheduling is never a problem and they truly work around your needs. Dr. Joh and his staff have made me a patient for life! thank you so much CJ Dentistry!!!!
