4	Our company has been doing business with this UPS store for the last 4 years. Service is friendly, prompt and helpful.I highly recommend it.
4	Their boxing/packaging is a little expensive, but everyhting else was good.
4	This UPS store was very clean and the customer service was good. I had a bit of a wait because I came first thing in the morning when they open, and it is the week before Christmas. They seemed organized and helpful.
