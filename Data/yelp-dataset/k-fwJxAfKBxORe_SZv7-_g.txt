4	Great little juice bar just opened in adj Westmount just above A Votre Sante. Fresh juiced juices and smoothly, energy bars and salads. A great addition to the neighbourhood.
2	Stopped by on Sunday and was served by a guy who obviously couldn't care less. A stark contrast to my earlier visit. I ordered the same green juice but this one tasted terrible and I threw it out. Not a good sign when service and quality can vary so greatly!
5	I go to rejuice every morning to start my day! The service is awesome (cute too) , amazing fresh juices and such a variety! Great addition to Sherbrooke street.
