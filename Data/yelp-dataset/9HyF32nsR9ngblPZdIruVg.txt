5	Shes always friendly and always accommodating.  It's so hard finding someone who actually listens and is able to give you what you want. I ALWAYS leave happy. I even just recently brought my sister and soon my best friend will be coming to her.. she's honestly a great person to come to, oh and prices are awesome too!
