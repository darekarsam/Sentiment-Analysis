5	Tacos Huicho has the best Mexican tacos in Phoenix I ate. They have good food service and amazing tacos that are super delicious. The best part about Tacos Huicho is that if you like the food they have a butcher and you can buy the meat to take home and cook. Overall Tacos Huicho is the place to go for Mexican tacos.
5	Had their tacos pollo and Carne at Arizona taco festival and was sooo tasty way better than a majority of others the line was long but for good reasons! I will be stopping by to pick up pollo for dinner tonight! Good Job guys your tacos are better than the other guys.
