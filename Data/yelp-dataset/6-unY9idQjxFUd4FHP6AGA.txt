1	I would not recommend this store. It is much costlier than the other Indian stores and the products they carry are old, sometimes beyond their expiry date.
1	I was cheated when I returned a pani puri packet(because it was smelling). He gave us the same packet again by faking us a change behind the counter. Learnt it was same when I realized that the knot was tied the same way I did before returning.
5	Smaller store, but still had a good selection of Indian groceries .Also had some great home-made items that were fun to try
