5	Tried to order my wife a MK watch online with no luck.  I needed it ASAP for her birthday and the darn thing was on back-order.  So I started calling around and checking out various retailer websites with no luck.  Fortunately, the MK store in SouthPark came through.  They didn't have this particular watch in stock BUT promised me they would call around their other stores to see if they could find it.  An hour later they called me, said they found the watch I wanted at a Florida store, and, if I wanted, they could overnight ship it to me.  They did - the watch arrived the next day like they said it would.Yes it was relatively expensive, but with service like that, I'll pay top dollar.

I was feeling disappointed, but luckily they had the right tools and I was out of there in five minutes! Yay!
4	I'm keeping it simple with this one: What I like most about this store is the people. The associates here are not pushy and they genuinely want you to be happy with your purchase. My mom and I stopped in on Saturday afternoon and the sales associates were all a delight! They showed us the new stuff and the older pieces and offered lots of suggestions. They really made shopping this here easy and simple.We made our purchase and were out the door in no time. Keep up the good work! I'm definitely a new loyal customer!
