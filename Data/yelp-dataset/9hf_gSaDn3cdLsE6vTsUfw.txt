5	Happy Wok is one of the best Chinese restaurants in the Madison area. In comparison to many places on campus, they offer infinitely better service and food. I typically get the General Tso's Chicken, and I've yet to be disappointed!Their menu is pretty standard, and they offer a nice selection of healthier items for those interested. The rice is always fresh and the vegetables as well.If you are looking for an affordable, easy Chinese food experience in Madison, I'd recommend the Happy Wok.
4	Always very good and the price is right!  The staff are friendly. The place is clean. The portions are huge and flavorful. They have a tv and it's never crowded.
