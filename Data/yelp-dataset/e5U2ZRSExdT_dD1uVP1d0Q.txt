5	Compton's is located on Sirus Lane which may be tricky to find without a GPS. Sirus is off of West Blvd [NC- 160],  if you're coming from downtown, on your left  0.4 mi passed the intersection of West Blvd. and Yorkmont Rd.  You'll pass Billy Graham Highway and the National Guard Base. *The establishment has a clean storefront  which intrinsically makes you doubt that you've arrived at car repair shop. There is a smallish sign for AC Delco/ Compton's. [If you'v hit Bynum, you've just passed it on your left.]The detailed directions have been provided because I WANT EVERYONE TO GO TO TODD.1) TODD IS AWESOME. He is patient, SUPER kind, and quite     exceptional at what he does. He replaced an alternator and a worn     AC belt  on a Nissan Maxima. He gave me an accurate quote of the     cost of the repair, called me with an update, and had the vehicle     ready in a matter of hours. Also, he advised us (my boyfriend and I)     on a car rebuild, taking the time to answer all of our questions even     the ones completely unrelated to reason for the visit. . I was     very impressed with his attention to the minutiae- he not only     answered our repair-irrelevant questions but he thoroughly       explained the processes and showed us the tools he would use for     those certain processes! 2) CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AN UTMOST PRIORITY at Compton's.     Todd provides accurate quotes based on honest assessments and         calls anytime there is a change to that quote. The waiting area is     large and clean and  stocked with FRESH coffee, earl grey tea, hot     chocolate, and tasty treats-  cookies/muffins. When Todd was     ringing me up, I told him that would like to leave a tip and he very     politely declined. 3) EXCELLENT CAR SERVICE. Todd  is affiliated with parts dealer AC      Delco and was able to get the part I needed on the spot! His prices      are very competitive and the warranties are great. He charged      139.50 for an alternator switch out (excluding the cost of the part          which was 208.18). Most other places charged at      least two hundred fo the labor. A "friend of a friend" said  he'd only      charge 150  but the car wouldn't have been ready until Monday.       Compton's is the best all around. You might pay a bit more for parts       because you're paying for a warranty on that part and guaranteed      service.          Compton's works on all types of vehicles, foreign and domestic.      When I dropped off my Nissan, I saw a Ford, Chevy, another       Nissan, a Toyota, couple motorcycles, and an enormous RV. You      know they're good at what they do when they can replace a head      gasket on a F550 from a Class A motor home. I had an alternator crap out Thursday and called nearly every place in Charlotte. Todd was the most  affordable AND he fixed my vehicle on a day he does not usually operate. I almost wish I had another reason for him to look at my car. I cannot promise that everyone's experience will be as serendipitous as mine, but you can all expect the same quality of service and integrity from Compton's. I generally do my own car maintenance so I have very discriminating tastes when it comes to auto repair. But I can confidently say that I will go no where else.
5	Compon's is a phenomenal shop: their work is superior and they truly understand customer service.  There is not place I would trust to work on my vehicles more!
5	We found out about Compton's from another auto repair repair business that we loyally patronize.  We were looking for a shop that services domestic autos and provides excellent customer service.  We run a small business with a company vehicles that run a lot and need maintenance.  Our experience with Compton's has been excellent.  If you are looking for a trustworthy mechanic give them a try.  You won't regret it.
