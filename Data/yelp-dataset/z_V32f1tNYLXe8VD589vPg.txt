5	WOW!!! Goody Woody's is the best food truck in town! Their Fried Taco's and "Goody" Ball Sliders are the best I have ever had. I am still craving a Fried Taco right now! Where are you???
4	I tried out Goody Woody's at Food Truck Friday in South End. Blake told me they were known for their fried tacos, so I took his word for it and was not disappointed! It was delicious and much bigger than I expected. Definitely worth the $5. They have a good menu selection, I love their truck design and they're super nice, so what's not to like?!

4	Checked out the food truck friday. Stopped at G.W's first.. had a fried chicken taco... a chicken taco that was fried .. not fried chicken in a taco.... It was pretty dang Tasty !
4	Wife and I were back in the NoDa area this past weekend, and we decided to stop by the NoDa Brewery again. This time, the food truck was Goody Woody's. I tried the cheeseburger, which I made into a double for 2$ more than the 9$ price tag, and the homemade "chips".  My cheeseburger was fully loaded with lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, ketchup and mustard.  Everything was fresh and the meat was high quality with very little fat, which made for a slightly less flavorful and less juicy burger.  Overall burger was good, but the "chips" were a disappointment, as they were fried tortillas that were cut up. The better half had the chicken burrito with a side fried plantains.  Again, fresh ingredients, fully loaded with flavorful chicken would describe the burrito.  The fried plantains were probably the best part of the whole meal.  They were lightly fried and crispy, but with a soft inside texture.I would not hesitate to order food here again, but would try some of their other options and definitely get the fried plantains next time.
