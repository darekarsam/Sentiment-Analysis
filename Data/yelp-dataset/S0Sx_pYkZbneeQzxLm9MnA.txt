2	I mean, how many stars can you really give a laundromat? This place smells like mildew constantly.. Like, since I've been going, it's never NOT smelled like mildew. I'd like to think that a place you go to clean things..should be clean? Guess not. Anyway, the people who work here are courteous and nice, if that matters.
4	This is the least scary/creepy laundromat I have been to.  It is relatively clean, usually doesn't smell too bad, the people who work there are so friendly, and most of the times the other customers are courteous.  They have big machines, which is nice when you only do your laundry once a month.  They also have a change machine inside, which is nice, I don't always have to save up a million quarters.  And it is right by Panera!  So you can go there, put your laundry in, and then sit at Panera while you are waiting for your laundry to be done.  I always chose this laundromat, and you should too!
4	Best place in the city for drop off laundry I've found so far. Period.
