4	This location opened up before the one at the Meadows did. Nicely stocked inventory (on racks and most available wall space) of sports wear for the sports lover; the setup/placement doesn't feel crowded. I don't recall seeing anything for the ladies, though (but what else is new huh? my usual complaint about sports stores, in general). Hats on sale, usually placed on a small table in front of the square-shaped store space- great deal; my sports-loving husband (NY Yankees/Jets/Knicks/ & Miami Hurricanes) bought a few hats here (has a sizable hat collection). I can't remember exactly what it was- but something like 2 hats for $20 or one hat for $12.99. And if you know how much these hats are a piece (usually $32.99), you know that this is a bargain.
5	Best deals on hats I've seen in a long time.I'll go again. The employees where attentive and respectful
5	We stopped by today after being turned away from another store. Jessi immediately acknowledged our presence and showed that she knew her products. We didn't plan on buying anything but her great service convinced us not only to buy a jersey but a couple of tank tops as well (yes they were a BOGO deal). It didn't stop with us though, she made sure she greeted every customer that walked in and some how juggled helping all of us by herself. I must say that we were impressed.We will definitely be coming back to this location in the future, thanks Jessi!
1	Called in for a simple question about if they had a specific jersey or not, and once was hung up on after being on hold, then the girl was completely rude and short when I called back. Learn some customer service.
