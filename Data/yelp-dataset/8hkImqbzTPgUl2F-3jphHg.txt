1	I do not give 1 star reviews easily. I've had a site hosted with them for a several years, constantly had to change mail server names to "fix" my mail so i could send and receive mail. Today my site went down completely and have been trying for hours to get them to fix it! Unacceptable! Especially when their business site is still up and functioning. Today they have lost my business.
5	I have been with Pair Networks since 2002 and there is a reason for that, they are great at what they do. Correspondence with the Pair team is quick (receive a response typically within 30min to an hour with the support team - sometimes even less) and usually within one email everything I need is addressed entirely. Their staff are also friendly, professional and knowledgeable which is helpful when you have to talk with them (have dealt with other hosting companies and the customer service was lacking). Out of the time I have been with Pair, I have only had my website down "ONCE" due to server problems in March 2012 (which they helped me with by transferring me to a new server). Though the price you pay for hosting is a bit on the pricey side, you sometimes get what you pay for and what I am getting is worth every penny! As long as Pair keeps doing what they are doing, I will be with them for life!
5	I have my business website and email hosted with Pair Networks.Support is always easy.  There is little to no wait time to speak with a support person.  They have always been very helpful.Today they did a great job retrieving important emails that I accidentally deleted from my business account.  They went into the backups and found the emails I needed.  They saved the day.  Thank you, Pair Networks!
