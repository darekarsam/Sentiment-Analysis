5	From the moment I walked into this store; the service and attention I received was top notch! Daniel Doria must have spent at least 45 minutes trying to resolve my phone issue.  I never once felt rushed or like another customer. I felt valued! Even Tyse stepped in to help by calling corporate for assistance. The professionalism exhibited by the employees and the ability to resolve my problem places this business at the top of my list for OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE!
5	I went to Bullfrog and I was soo pleased with the service I got. Christina Beltran helped me and she went above and beyond, I got early upgrades on mine and my husband's lines, we got the Galaxy S5 and overall it was just a great experience.  I live in Chinatown,  but I would definitely take the ride to Aliante for all my wireless needs.
5	I went to sign up for a new contract and to keep my phone number with my old carrier. I spoke with Steven and he was amazing! excellent customer service, he gave me discounts on some items and set up my phone with no problems.  you will never find that kind of customer service at any other verizon store.
5	I just recently went in to replace a broken iPhone. I worked with Robert and Christina and they couldn't have been more helpful. On my first visit, Robert asked questions to determine my needs and than made a recommendation that would suite me and my needs best. He went above and beyond to help me and got me on my way quick. I ended up with an issue with the device a few days later and called to speak with Robert. I appreciated that the call was quickly routed without having to press a lot of options. I spoke with Christina who was professional and willing to help. I stopped in later and Both Robert and Christina took care of me and made the process easy and painless. I appreciate their help and the service they provided. Best customer service I've received in along time!!!
