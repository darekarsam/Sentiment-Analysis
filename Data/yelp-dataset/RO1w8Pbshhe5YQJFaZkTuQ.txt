1	I wasn't with my son when he rented but I was happy to bring it back after he wore it. Horrible quality tuxes for rent. The shirt my son got with his $180 tux rental had severe neck sweat stains. Gross. The pants still had the hem pins in them and the material felt like asbestos. The clerk said "yep they are horrible but that's what you get when you rent something that 1000 people have worn."  I confirmed that you at least expect clean and decent or very cheap. This was neither. Won't use them again. They know they are screwing teenagers but want them to buy suits instead for less. Wow.
5	I've been here two times now. The staff are very nice. They had a huge back log on the tailoring and they were able to sneak me in. The buy 1 get 18 free is also nice.
3	I like a store where I can get in and get out quickly.  The Men's department all in one handy store.  Was able to stock up on some essentials without any issues.  The staff was friendly and helpful.
