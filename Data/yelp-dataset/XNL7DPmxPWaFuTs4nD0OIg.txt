5	Love the fruits! Great prices as well! Open 24 hours (if I'm not mistaken).Fyi, during the winter time, it turns to a Christmas tree place
5	I'm always really happy to see this place. It's 24/7 and provides such an awesome alternative to late night snacking. Their selection is pretty nice and every now and then they'll have something very seasonal. They've got great nuts and even the baked goods are worth trying!A little more expensive than a lil grocery store but worth it given that you know where it's coming from!
4	Great fresh veggies at decent price! It's quite small so be careful not to bump into others and be careful not to be tricked by (how come these are so) cheap products because they might be rotten... but other than these two things, it's nice! Opens 24 hrs. Fresher than Maxi, IGA or any other grocery stores in my point of view
