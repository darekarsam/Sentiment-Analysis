5	Katrina has been a blessing for my body! She assisted me in unwinding muscles that had been injured during my daily exercises (fell on my neck by hanging upside down on pull up bar).  Repeat customer for sure! Thank you, Kat !
5	I started seeing Katrina for Massage because i had alot of lower back pain as I am a Massage Therapist as well. Not only does she help relieve all of the pent up pain and stress from my job, she teaches me about my body/mind and spirit as well. In her Massage though, she does a very unique Massage that is all her own combining many modalities that feel simply wonderful. She adds stretching and long flowing strokes and when she adds the hot stones, my muscles completely melt.Everything she does really takes you to a different place of being. She definitely adds many spiritual elements to the Massage that nurture on an energetic level releasing emotional blocks and holding patterns in the body. She teaches you how to let go.I recommend her highly and once you've tried her, you won't want another therapist.
5	I came to Kat with terrible back and neck pain.  I suffer from fibromayalgia so body work can be a double edged sword.  Already painful muscles can be even more painful the day following body work.  And too heavy a hand can make a massage excruciating.  Kat was the perfect balance.  I instantly slipped into a peaceful state.  My body went limp and the stresses of the day melted away. I felt safe and at ease in her space.  She was able to work out the painful knots in a relaxing and soothing manner making it an enjoyable experience.  After our session I felt looser and had a sense of peace and tranquility. I felt calmer and more present. And best of all I had far less pain and my muscles were now relaxed.  I would definitely recommend!
