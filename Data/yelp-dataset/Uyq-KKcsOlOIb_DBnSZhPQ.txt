3	This bar is not preppy, yuppy, upscale, or trendy. It is not going to serve you fancy micro-beers, or have hundreds of beer taps.  This is a good neighborhood bar with friendly people and a fun (though entirely irreverent and adult focused) comedy night.Don't be fooled - the Corner Cafe may sit between Monastery Avenue, Monastery Place and 18th Street - but you won't find many saints there. In fact, if you are easily offended by dirty jokes - especially targeted at the crowd, don't bother.I, on the other hand, do not get offended. I like a touch of Americana with my beer once in awhile.  I like knowing I can go somewhere and not have to be dressed to the nines to get bar service. Pros:-Good old Pittsburgh neighborhood Bar-Entertaining manager-Welcoming crowd-Attracts a variety of age ranges, though I would say the average was 30+ for a Monday night.-comedy night!Cons:-Be ready to wash the smoke off your face-Ladies may want a friend to escort to their car, on street parking only
4	Great place to watch the game. Might not be the most upscale place but the people are friendly. They have specials during games and happy hour. I think it's a great bar.
4	This place is just the type of bar we have been looking for. Bar tender was great, I think her name was Lindsay. The drinks were cheap enough but good. They have specials on during games. This bar has definitely made a couple of more patrons.
