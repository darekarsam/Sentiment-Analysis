4	Usually  has the lowest gas prices within a 5 mile radius of my home. I can also walk here if I want. I don't care for the traffic from the McDonald's next door, but eh...Life goes on. There is a red box out front. Propane. Plenty of snacks, and your basic quick stop essentials. The staff usually say hello and are fairly friendly. I'd rather go here than the chevron down the street.
2	Always slow... Just head over to Quik Trip... Life changing!! Ha
1	This circle K is one of the worst I've ever been to.  I hate paying for gas here!  The pumps are very old and they almost never have the print receipt option working.  It's the closest gas station to where I live and I prefer to drive an extra 5 miles to the QT.  The staff look like ex convicts and aren't very helpful as to why the pumps never work.
1	Stopped here to get a propane refill and the girl at the counter said no one was working who could refill it for me. Heads up folks, if you offer a service, you should train someone to do that service, even if it is the weekend!
1	Was verbally harassed by a clerk here for looking young. Let it be known that yes I look young and I was buying cigarettes. The clerk right away said you don't look a day over 16. I said well I am legally able to buy them and handed him my ID. Right away he shakes his head and said kids these days. Feeling insulted I asked what do you mean kids these days? He said nothing back but I've never been so insulted with buying cigarettes in my life. If I have the proof that I am over the age to buy them why carry it on to insult someone who is providing you business? Not to mention with my frustration I went to the car and told my boyfriend what had happened and the clerk pointed and laughed at me with other customers. This circle k will never get my or my families business again especially after multiple cases of other members in my family being harassed as well.
