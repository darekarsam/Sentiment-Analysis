4	Location, location, location.  Amongst all the tire shops and barber shops that smatter that stretch of The Plaza and next to the Food Lion is the very unassuming China Bowl.Do not be intimidated by the neighborhood, the bright orange exterior, or the bars on the front windows, the China Bowl is a gem!This is AMAZING Chinese takeout!  Opening for and offering lunch specials, the Bowl is open until 9pm weeknights and 9.30pm Friday and Saturday (closed Sunday).With standard Chinese takeout fare, I was lured in for beef and broccoli and was pleasantly surprised with their wings.  Great flavor for fried chicken wings.  They also do Buffalo, Sesame and BBQ wings which I will be sure to try as well as their boneless spare ribs.Call ahead as there really isn't any seating and it may take a few minutes for your grub to be ready.
2	Fast food Chinese restaurants are as good as their Sweet and Sour Chicken dish and I can't say I was impressed by China Bowl's.  Granted, the lunch special was a mere $5 (not including the .75 charge for using debit) but the sweet and sour chicken was tasteless.  The chicken was soggy and the disturbingly dark sauce was tasted burnt yet bland. The portions were decent however. Maybe I need to try more dishes or "upgrade" to non-lunch specials, but I'm definitely not ordering S & S chicken again.  Will give China Bowl another try thanks to the review of the reputable Mr. Jared Y..
3	Meh. I wish this place was awesome because it is so close to my house. But it's the kind of greasy, MSG-laden cuisine that is often served as Chinese fare. Portions are good, but the food is just ok. It's takeout-only.
2	Nothing special at all. Tastes average. No different from any other Chinese restaurant. Standard sauces add sesame = sesame chicken... Etc etc. Wasn't sure if the chicken was really chicken!
2	Mediocre food, minimal menu and poor customer service. I love Chinese food and live around the corner but can't go back here.
