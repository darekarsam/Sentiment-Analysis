3	Nice mediterranean market, I've bought really good lamb at the butcher counter before; and they also have a tub of really spicy red-pepper-paste-marinated green olives. Good!! They also have bulk tubs of regular green and kalamatas as well; but the green olives are too bright/lemony for my tastes...Lots of fresh [bulk] beans & legumes in the cold cases too.
4	Pomegranate, Molasses Spices, Big jars of Grape Leaves!  Here is what impressed me most about this small Market,,, The guy could not understand our broken Turkish, my Girlfriend is part Turkish, so here is what this guy does, he takes us next door to the Golden Bakery to ask the Owner there to translate!  It Worked!!!If you are looking for a Halal Market then you already know about dietary codes, even though this Market has more than Meat!  If you not not know  about Halal, I will not be the one describing it to you...  Let's just say it is a Strict "Preparation" Method for "handling" Meat to comply with dietary codes!
