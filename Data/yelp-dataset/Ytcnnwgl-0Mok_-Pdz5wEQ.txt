4	Very nice place! Good menu, lots of choices :)
4	One of the best pizza on in Montreal. Very fresh and tasty ingredients.Decor is interesting and staff is attentive.Very nice experience overall.Tips: Ask the staff which wine to get. It worked very well for us.
4	The staggered seating at multiple elevations maximizes the space while allowing the sense of privacy. Love the selection of original pizzas which includes lobster and a nightly special (venison was the feature the evening that we dined there).  I'd recommend the Guanciale with mint and spicy peppers. Stunning.
4	I (finally!) got to try Mangiafoco during lunchtime and it was de-li-cious !! We had the burratina mozzarella as a starter which was a rich, creamy, yummy, fresh cheese ! Enjoyed it with a lovely half-dried and smoked tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, artichokes and basil salad. Perfect !As our mains we shared two pizzas, one with a great mix of mushrooms and another one with mortadella, prosciutto and fresh mozzarella. They were delicious ! You can definitely tell how fresh the ingredients are. Loved it. I did not see the bill but I do believe the prices are a bit high. But definitely worth it. I hadn't enjoyed such fresh and yummy pizza in quite a while and the mozzarella bar is totally worth the try ! I will be back. And back again, and again :)
4	Fresh ingredients as far as produce is a must (I don't eat beef or pork) so this joint nailed it for quality greens and spices. Wines were a tad pricy but quality nonetheless.
5	Where do I start? The place was booked up, even in a Monday, but we snagged two spots at the bar, easily. The entire staff was fun, attentive and knowledgeable. The veal meatballs are so tender they'll make you cry. The pizza crust regardless of pizza, is excellent. I love the mozz bar: pick your mozzarella and a few sides to Choose Your Own App Adventure :-) Save room for the white chocolate mousse!
