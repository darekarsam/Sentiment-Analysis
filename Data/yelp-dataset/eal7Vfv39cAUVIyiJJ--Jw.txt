4	Have great lunch specials...Located near the Uni...Really friendly staff...
4	Saffrani is a great Indian restaurant by Edinburgh University that is extremely convenient in Old Town. I have been twice for dinner, both times with different voucher deals. I thought the curries were fantastic generally, except Mason R. had the lamb saag last time and, after I tried it, my mouth was still on fire for a full five minutes after (and it was only rated as medium spicy!). I had a creamy coconut curry with chicken that was delicious. The garlic naan was also really good. Prices were reasonable and average for Indian places here, and I thought the staff were friendly and the food was served fairly promptly, too. They had good Cobra beer and I enjoyed the mango lassi here, too. This place is a great little find and I'll be back again for dinner, or for one of their lunch deals.
5	Pretty good! It was a little slow when we went, so we got a lot of attention from the wait staff. The food was reasonably priced and absolutely delicious!
4	Nice little restaurant tucked away on South College St. Its small and cosy and serves great food. Service was a little slow even though it wasn't that busy but reward was great fresh food. The waiter was very helpful to explain the differences between dishes and really enjoyed my visit. Another great find.
3	The first time I tried haggis was, weirdly, in the naan here. (Obviously authenticity isn't something I necessarily give a shit about when it comes to eating out.) It was kind of like pate.I think my friend and I also had the lamb dhansak, brinjal masala, and mushroom rice. All pretty tasty.The waiter was very friendly and attentive and just generally pleasant.
