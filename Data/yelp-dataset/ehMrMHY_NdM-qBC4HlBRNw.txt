5	Debi is fantastic  -  friendly, welcoming and great at her job.  Just in time for those holiday photos, Debi's dermaplaning facial completely refreshed and revived my skin. A soothing mask topped off pore extractions and a gentle exfoliation treatment making my skin feel smooth and clean.  Debi walks you through the whole treatment and uses products that feel and smell wonderful. Do your skin a favor and go visit Debi!
5	I had a baby 2 years ago, and, while I am in fairly good shape with Crossfit, I had some baby weight that was stubborn in my lower abdomen. I also lost a lot of elasticity from breastfeeding and felt that my chest was sagging. Debi did wonders for me with her microcurrent treatments! Not only was my abdomen much more contoured but I even have a lift in my breasts (they even seemed fuller which I didn't expect). I am so excited with what she has done. I had 6 treatments in both areas. Very happy! :)
5	I have been a client since November 2013 and I can honestly say the I have seen excellent results with Debi. She takes the time to listen to my concerns and determines the perfect treatment plan for my particular issues. We have even discussed a very frustrating problem of adult acne, for which Debi has suggested great products that have helped. I am very happy with all aspects of the care I receive and plan to continue my treatments here with Debi.
5	Thanks to Debbie and her amazing recommendations, I have seen a great transformation in my skin. She took the time and had understanding as I have had years of bad luck with facial products.  I am so glad that I met Debbie, the products she suggested have helped to clear acne, redness, reduce pores and even smooth the texture of my skin.  I am a Nurse Practitioner and have worked in the area of dermatology, but only since working with Debbie have I seen an amazing change. Thank you Debbie!
