4	Took kiddo here for a birthday party. Comparable to MJ's in theory... lots of big inflatables for kids to run and bounce and climb and slide upon. BUT... kicks MJ's booty as far as I'm concerned! My child, who is 5, kinda freaks out and melts down at MJ's because it's so big and typically crowded with kids who are too big and rough and rude. But here, it's toned down. Still plenty of fun bouncy climby options but not too overwhelming. The place is shut-down to the public when birthday parties are in session which is incredible and perfect. The kids got an hour in the bouncy room and there is seating in and out of the space for parents to hang out. Then they went in the party room for food which was followed by another hour to play in the facility's arcade where they could enjoy video games, small mini-golf holes and various old-fashioned carnival type games - all free! The kids seemed to have an absolute blast and I felt like we'd found something great. Can't wait to bring kiddo back another time when they're open to the public to get a feel for the vibe during those times.
5	Awesome, awesome place.  Had my daughter's sixth birthday party here today and had a BLAST!  Everything was so well executed and organized.... will be back for my other two children's party.  Great concept, the whole place to yourself!!  Also, a video game room to break up the time on the inflatables.  Jan, who is the new owner, has done a wonderful job on this place and we are so pleased!  Thanks again Space Kidets!  BTW:  Riley's review: "I love it so much I want to marry Space Kidets one day!"
1	Ew, clean the darn bathrooms!  The owner sat at his computer the entire time I was there with my daughter while the bathrooms were disgustingly unsanitary.  No toilet paper, no towels to dry our hands and NO SOAP!  I will NOT be back here again!
