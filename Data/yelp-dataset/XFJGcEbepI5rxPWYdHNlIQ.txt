5	Stopped in the store @ the Bellagio to look for a wallet. The salesman was very helpful and I was able to select one pretty easily. Love this store!
1	Worst saleswoman ever. My husband and I were going for a stroll after a fantastic dinner. When we go on vacation (rare occurrence), we like to buy something that is his and hers. My birthday is also coming up and we wanted to take a look at the belt colors and buckles.  She hesitantly asked us if there was something we were interested in. As soon as I uttered belt, she looked me up and down and said that none of her belts will fit me. How rude!! I'm a size 6 in pants. We were dressed fairly modestly so how would she know that we were both physicians who could afford an extravagant belt, or 2. I will never purchase anything in this store and I suggest the same to you. If I could give this store's location a negative star, I would.
5	I began my Hermes adventure with the wonderful Ms. Sarah at this dainty little boutique tucked away in the lobby of Bellagio.Sarah is such a sweet SA, and even though I sometimes shop at my local H boutique, she's always provided top notch service and of course.... gorgeous bags.Ask for Sarah, she will take care of you.
