5	I was very pleased with the auto body work done on my Tundra. I shopped around and they beat other quotes by $300-400. My truck was washed when I picked it up. They do a lot of work for Toyota dealer. I rarely give 5 star grades but they deserve it.
5	I love these guys they took such good care of me after the big storm in July of 2013. They are amazing and such good guys.
5	After 40+ years of driving, I had my first fender bender. Ashamed to even drive my car, I found Colorpoint through the Toyota dealer in Henderson. Luis Bravo, manager took really good care of my car. My car is 10 years old and it literally looks new again. I would highly recommend Colorpoint to anyone looking for incredible workmanship/quality and probably the fairest pricing around. Dont let the non glamorous office fool you, these guys are professional all the way. I hope I never have to use them again, but if I do I will.
5	Another bang up job by these guys for a reasonable price. My car looks like new. It was detailed nice when I picked it I'll. They also let me use a free loaner car for a few days. Two thumbs up!
