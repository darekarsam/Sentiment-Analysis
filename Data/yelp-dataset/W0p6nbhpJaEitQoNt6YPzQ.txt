1	I could not have been less impressed with the hostile and unprofessional attitude of everyone I encountered at Hastings and Hastings.  Learn from my mistake and don't bother calling these people.
5	Best Law Firm in Arizona.  Could not have been more impressed with the result and the discount fee helped me get a higher settlement!  Thanks everyone!
5	I can't say how happy I am with Hastings & Hastings right now. I came to them about 9 months ago after my accident and today I received my settlement. Everyone there was very nice and helpful. My attorney's paralegal always responded to my emails quickly which really impressed me. I'm so pleased with my experience with them that I had to write a review!
1	Hey Hastings and Hastings--Here's your update.The rude, hostile, snotty girl who answers your phone told me I had no case and absolutely refused to let me speak with an attorney.  Phillips and Lyon just got us an accident settlement offer of almost $15,000.
5	They are great! They do preliminary questions to make sure that you aren't wasting your time (or theirs). They stand up for you and do what is right for you. Can't say enough positive comments on how they handled my case. They are responsive to emails and follow up. They only take legitimate cases and don't subscribe to "frivolous" lawsuits.
5	My daughter got in a car accident and Joseph Brown took excellent care of us. He was professional and always forthcoming. Communicated with us every step of the way. He made sure my daughter was taken care of and referred us to the right people. When we had some of our own people to use, he never pushed back. In the last 4 months, I have yet to feel pressured by this law firm. Mr. Brown has been incredible and he'll have our family as clients for life.
