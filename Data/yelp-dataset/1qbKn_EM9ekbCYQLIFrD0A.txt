1	Very condescending employees. I've also been given extremely bad information twice. Thankfully I knew better than to put acid in my pool when it's not running (employee insisted the pool shouldn't be running). I also questioned being told to put a cup of acid in my hot tub (I've never done more than 2 T). Thankfully I've had better luck at other locations.My mistake for going back for more torture. I'm now shocked to discover their ridiculous mark up on parts. They wanted $65 for a part for my pool cleaner. The same part is $24 on amazon, they refused to price match. And claimed amazon sold inferior parts. Got my part from amazon in 24 hours, brand name, Exact same thing. Leslie's should be ashamed of themselves. I am done with this place. I won't even go here for chemicals anymore.
5	I've only had good experiences with Leslie's and their staff. They taught me how to properly maintain my pool and I rarely need to maintain it anymore quite honestly. People compliment the water quality/clarity of my pool whenever they are over. That is why Leslie's has earned my business over-and-over again.They also offer free vacuum repair service, you pay for the parts. They will also disassemble and let you keep the old parts that are still good if you opt for a new vacuum.
1	This place is a scam. They sold me a phos free that didn't work then I took it back and then I was told I should have bought the more powerful stuff for $99. Should of told me that before I already spent $69 on the stuff that wouldn't even work since my phos  levels were off but they we're the ones who tested it.
