3	3.8 StarsThis is the hotel where we stay at every time we go to Montreal. Nice & clean rooms and friendly service but that's really it. It's really kind of mediocre at best. Nickel's the restaurant in the hotel is awful. Food is mediocre or below that. The service there is also sometimes awful. I'd definitely recommend this place if you want a nice good hotel but if you want something really high in expectations don't come here!
3	Stayed at the Quality Suites for a mini staycation, just one night. Room was nicely appointed, live the fact that the living area is separate from the bedroom. King bed was comfortable, as were the pillows. Towels were rough, sadly, like many hotels. Analog TV signal was disappointing for 2014. Shower drain made a ton of noise, so it was difficult to enjoy my shower with someone sleeping in the next room. Exercise room was small but had a nice selection of machines. Watch out for the seemingly electrified bed spread though. Every time we touched it we got charged for a shock. Finally, we realized the culprit and tried to take it off the bed, but the experience lit me up, literally. I felt like I could power the crappy TV for at least a few minutes just by touching it. Weird.All in all, a very passable stay. Nothing wrong, though nothing memorable with this building.
