1	the dry cleaning portion of this business is fine the prices are pretty decent to. what you need to watch out for is the alterations part, I just needed my husbands brand new Calvin Klein suit pants tailored. I didn't notice because we picked them up the day of the party but my husband later showed me and it looked horrible like I could have done a better job with my sewing machine. it looked awful and I still want to go back and show them but I don't have anything and it's been a few months. this seamstress couldn't even do a straight line I'm so pissed.
5	Great little community cleaners in this neighborhood. The prices are fair and the service is excellent. I always stop by here when visiting my parents. Although another user mentioned issues about their tailoring, I've never had an issue with any of my clothing. I highly recommend this place. :)
1	I loved this cleaners before. The old owners where nice and kind. The old tailor was awesome and the best. Now the cleaners has new owners who treat their customers really bad and obviously don't have a clue what tailoring is.  I don't recommend this place any longer. If you want to be disrespected and not have next day service then this place is for you. As for me, I am in a quest to find another cleaners and a reputable tailor.
