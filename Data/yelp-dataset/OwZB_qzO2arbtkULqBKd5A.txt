1	Bad experience as first visit.  Long wait and wasnt satified with the zero fade. Rushed job.  I wont be back
4	just moved to vegas from LA and a co-worker told me about this place so I decided to give it a try. switching barbers isn't always easy but I was pretty satisfied!the environment was relaxed and there wasn't a long wait time. was there for about 2 minutes until I was helped and the barber was really helpful in making sure that I got what I asked for and understood the actual terminologies. price was similar to what im used to so there wasn't a big surprise.I would definitely go back again and now im relieved I don't have to keep searching for a new barber.
1	"So unprofessional!!! The barber never introduced himself nor did he ask for my name; I asked for a simple line up-dude didn't  pay attention to my face to see if what he was doing was working-it wasn't! I mean I wasn't even in the chair 10minutes man ..He didn't line up behind my ears -___- even worse, he did NOT even use a clean razor!! Really. And as if it couldn't get any worse- they were conducting themselves unproffesionally- who runs an establishment where it's cool to curse in front of kids?? This place was a terrible first and LAST experience. The ABSOLUTE WORST place to go don't waste ur time and money"
