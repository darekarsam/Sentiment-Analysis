5	After my first meeting with Adam I knew that his info absolutely had to be saved in my phone.  Too many life insurance agents are more about pushing the sale than doing what's actual best for the customer, and Adam was definitely about doing what's best for me.  He reviewed my coverage at that time, went over my 'needs', and gave me what I could tell was very honest feedback.  I've since also met with him about long term care insurance and disability insurance, and his info on everything was 100% genuine and in my best interest, never once did I feel like I was being pushed into anything.  Great, smart guy, I can't say enough good stuff about him, without a doubt call him if you are looking for long-term/disability/life insurance, and I'm sure other similar things that I don't know about :)
5	I have learned so much from Adam about life insurance, long term care insurance, etc. For example, 70% of people who live to 65 will need long term care. That is good to know. Anyway, when our old term life policy was about to expire we had Adam do some quotes for us. He came to our home, explained everything to us in way that made it easy for us to understand and made us feel very comfortable. We got a new policy with him and have referred friends and family to him. I highly recommend giving him a call and having a conversation with him. At the very least you are likely to end the conversation a little smarter than when it started.
5	I have known Adam for 3 years through a business networking group and he has always demonstrated excellent knowledge on his field. It is hard to find an insurance agent that cares about his clients versus just getting the sale! I highly recommend him if you need life ins or long term care ins!
