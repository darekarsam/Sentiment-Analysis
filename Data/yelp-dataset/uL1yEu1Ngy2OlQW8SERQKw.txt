5	Great stamp shop friendly staff...any stamp you can imagine is most likely there my second trip there was even better than the first!!firsthand
5	This store is Amaze-Balls!!!  It really is wall to wall stamps and little else. I love that they has something for everyone. There are mermaids, presidents, vintage cars, steam punk, every saying that you could imagine on a stamp and you never thought you would see. They have a variety of art styles so you can find you image in the style you are looking for. They have the typical holiday, floral, dogs and cats and so on - but again, in a variety of styles. If you can think of something wild, they probably have it or can get it for you. I was there for 2 hours and I could have been there longer.  This really is a must see if you are in Vegas and a stamper.
