5	I've literally just got in from Fatma's.....I'm a fan of Hanams but this place is on another level! Had a platter of starters between us and as someone who adores Middle Eastern food my standards are quite high (we eat out in Dubai a lot!) I have to say that the food was divine. We chatted to the owner/chef who has his takeaway cartons arriving shortly...no doubt these guys will be seeing our custom from all angles! I genuinely didn't have one complaint. The Moutabal, Arayess & Mouhallabieh were particularly delightful. I think I'll be taking my tourist friends here instead of my midtown staple from now on... 100% recommended
4	I really enjoy middle eastern food, so when I spotted this restaurant on Commercial Street I knew wanted to try this place..Tanja R. and I decided to find out what Fatma is all about.. The waiter informed me that they have only been there for 3 months. He brought us the menus and explained that a good way to enjoy the 'lebanese experience' is to share smallish mezze plates and he recommended 5 mezze plates for 2 people. Though he did also mention that the portions are reasonably large - so caution in mind we went for 4 mezze plates: hummus, grilled halloumi, arayes and lamb skewer. They also brough flatbread and 3 different kind of dips to go with the food. All the food was delicious, I especially enjoyed the halloumi cheese. The hummus was quite nice too as was the arayes (toasted pitta bread stuffed with spiced minced lamb). The lamb skewer was tasty, albeit a bit chewy. The restaurant itself was very modern - nothing wrong with it per se but it just lacked atmosphere. I think a really authentic looking place would elevate this experience - hmm.. maybe even to five stars!  :)
