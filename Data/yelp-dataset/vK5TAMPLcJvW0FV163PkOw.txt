1	I'm sorry but the employees at this location are RUDE. I asked for help and they were upset because I interrupted their personal conversation. They want you to spend all your money. I asked if they had any deals and they rudely said "No" but then when I went to go pay for my stuff one of the workers allowed the customer who was  checking out next to me use multiple coupons. I bought an outfit for my Daughter while she was at school not knowing if she was going to like it or not and she ended up seeing something at a different store for half the price, so I went back the next day to get my money back (the male at the counter said I had 30 days to get a full refund with receipt) and when I went back the girl at the counter said she was only going to give me store credit. I said "I don't need store credit, there is nothing here that I want to buy and the guy told me I can get my money back before 30 days" She was very upset, started slamming things around, was very rude and she ended up getting so frustrated that she made another girl finish the transaction and she went to help another customer. I love Childrens Place but I will NEVER again return to this location!
