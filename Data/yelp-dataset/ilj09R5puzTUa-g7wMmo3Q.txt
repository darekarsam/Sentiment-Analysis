5	Norma is a great barber. I followed her over to her new location.
5	Edgar excellent:  fine young man, fine barber.  Great vibe, cool boxing posters.
3	Price is great but I came in and got a crooked line up. The place was empty so I was able to go in and out quickly. I also wouldn't recommend coming around the area when it's dark.
5	Amazing family owned Barbershop which will excel your quality expectations!! It's a must go here!! Andy R was my barber and will always be!!
