5	I have been going to Dominique Pfeiffer to have gel manicures twice a month for many years.  She always does outstanding work and I can count on her to be there on time.  I enjoy spending time with her and I know I will leave a good impression wherever I go with how professional and beautiful my hands look!  I can't recommend her highly enough.  For an appointment call or text her at:  702.281.1622.
5	Holly is my stylist I would definitely recommend her. She always does a great job in coloring and styling.
5	I must admit that my hair isn't at the top of my priority list. I'm one of those women that will get a haircut twice a year. Not to mention, moving to a new town and being unfamiliar with numerous "new" salons can be intimidating. So I did what I know best and turned to my fellow yelpers. As always the Yelpers were right on the money....Canyon Falls is where it's at! Patty is amazing for the following reasons: 1) She was able to accommodate a new client immediately (and this was during one of her busiest seasons, right before the holidays). 2) She was incredibly welcoming, friendly and easy to connect too. I left feeling like I've known her for years. 3) Not only did she use her professional expertise to give me exactly what I wanted, but she have me tips and advice on how to better care for my hair. 4) Lastly, her beautiful work came with an affordable price (I'm working with a substitute's salary).  If you're new to the area or in need of a new stylist I highly recommend Patty! You can ask for her by name or PM me for her direct contact!
