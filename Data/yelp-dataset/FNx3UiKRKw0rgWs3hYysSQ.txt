4	I came in during lunch hour for a mani pedi. This was my first visit and I was very happy with their customer service. I was served by 2 ladies simultaneously, one attended to my hands and the other to my feet. they were smiling throughout and seemed really passionate about servicing my hands and feet. I got a foot and hand massage. Following this, they applied my nail colour with extreme care. My nails look great! After my session, they carried my purse, shoes and coat to the drying area. Just as I was about to take off the paper sandals they've provided, one of the ladies came running to help me. In addition, she wrapped my toenails with a plastic wrapper and put my shoes on for me. Nice!
1	Went to a different nail place to get a manicure/pedicure. I went to @modsnails ew ew ew. The towels were dirty! I asked her to change it, she insisted it was clean with dirty dirty stains everywhere!! No tools were cleaned! No desinfectants! She cut my cuticles and put the cover back on all the tools. My husband @leoboccardi had to come in to the salon, leave his work to ask the woman to change the towel. And she shoots me a dirty look!! So unsanitary! Nobody seemed to care!! What's wrong westmount! Dr Oz warned me about places like that!! And some people were getting waxing done! never going back again. An of course they spend the whole time talking in their native tongue - which is always and constantly disrespectful to clients.  #westmount #nails #manicure #pedicure #norespect #awful #dirty please @nstylecanada do not be full again. They are clean, nice, respectful! If you care about your health you would NOT go to @modsnails.
1	They have become rude and snobby, the manicures are good but with the attitude carried by most of the employees, I wont be coming back .. not recommended
