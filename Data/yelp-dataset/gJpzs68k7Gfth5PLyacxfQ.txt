5	My A/C stopped working, of course, on a Sunday morning.  I called Alternative Air and they picked up the phone within a few rings (I had expected to have to leave a message and wait for someone to get back to me). They dispatched a technician (Ray) within a couple hours and diagnosed the problem quickly. The parts were not on the truck at the time, so he came and fixed the A/C on Monday morning without an additional service charge.I was extremely impressed many aspects of the service: promptness, courtesy, friendly communications, ease of scheduling, reasonable rates & no extra charge for weekend service.I will definitely call Alternative Air for any future issues with my HVAC.
5	We have been using Alternative Air Heating & Cooling for 2 years now since we moved to Maricopa! This company is honest, trustworthy, EXCELLENT!!!  Will continue to use their service!! They were just out yesterday to service our air and as always, courteous, prompt, helpful and reasonable rates.  Highly recommend this business!!!
5	yes,  yes,  yes. true example of great and fast customer service,  I had contacted another local AC company from yelp last week but they never showed up,  today was my first available day off,  so I've been miserable for a week now, I woke up found this company and based on reviews gave it a try, I called them at 8:22am, they tech Jamie showed up at 10:30 on the dot as promised, checked my attic,  told me the problem and cost to fix and now I'm sitting on my couch with that beautiful cold air blowing at 11:30, a week of suffering resolved in a hour, my only complaint is that I didn't call them last week. .i will def use them again if necessary and recommend them,  being a homeowner in Maricopa I'm happy to give a local company my business. . nice job
