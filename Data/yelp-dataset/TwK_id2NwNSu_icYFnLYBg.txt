5	Caring, kind, speaks the truth to you and ALWAYS looks on the bright side of everything!
5	When I called with a broken veneer, they got me in within the hour.  Everyone in the office is very nice and Dr. Lysgaard is very friendly and kind.  He was gentle and explained each step as it was happening.  I would recommend him to everyone.
5	I have been Dr. L's patient for about 2 years.  Dr. L. and his staff (hygienist, receptionists) are wonderful!!  Super friendly, prompt, and--most important--ethical.  One of my favorite things about this place is the zero pressure to steer patients into unnecessary procedures (whiteners, repeated x-rays, etc.) to pad the profits as so many newer dentists sadly do these days.  This practice has been around for decades and has a great community reputation and strong patient loyalty.  For good reason.  Dr. L even fixed a small chip on my tooth 2 times and didn't charge me a cent.  Where else can you get this kind of exceptional service?!!I recently moved out of state and, frankly, I have had a heck of a time finding a decent, ethical dentist in my new state.  I am seriously considering flying back to LV for a quick visit just to get my "maintenance" here.
