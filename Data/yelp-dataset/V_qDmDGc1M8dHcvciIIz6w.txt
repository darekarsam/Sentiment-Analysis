5	I love restaurant week!  I have to say this was my first real time being able to take part in the festivities. We went to two restaurants during the week, and both were great!  Overall I think that it was really well executed, but I found that finding restaurants to go to on Monday was very difficult because many are closed that day.
4	I have to echo @Sharon F. as loving Pittsburgh Restaurant Week.  This was also my first time participating and I'm sure it won't be my last.Love the wide variety of restaurants offering great deals.  Reservations at all the restaurants is def. encouraged, and I'm glad I had one for Bistro 19 in Mt. Lebo as it was packed the Saturday evening I dined there.The Kick-off event was fun, but I have to suggest more than one bar and to stagger the food.  So much good food was circulating and I had a hard time remembering which food was from what venue, as all the food came out at once.  It was all delicous so I'd like to give credit where credit is due:)  Venue, Mini-Cooper of Pittsburgh, was unique and interesting.
5	I love the restaurant week and the kickoff party!
5	I really love the restaurant week and the restaurant week party! The party at the aviary is amazing, and the food is great and there are a ton of restaurants there. My favorite this year was either Ibiza or Wooden Nickel, but all of the restaurants are amazing... Oh, did I mention that the aviary has a SLOTH!
