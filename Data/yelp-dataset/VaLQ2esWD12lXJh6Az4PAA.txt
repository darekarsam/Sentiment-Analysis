5	We were so happy with Fully Alive Photography for our wedding.  Tracy was organized, professional, and so much fun!  Throughout the entire process she was easy to communicate with and prompt with responses if I ever had a question.  Our bridal party all commented on how great and fun she was.  Our wedding photos were awesome and I love looking at them, smiling, and remembering what an amazing day it was.  I recommend Fully Alive highly!  :)
5	Fully Alive Photography was fantastic! We had both an engagement shoot and she shot our wedding. Despite terrible weather at our wedding, she made everything fun and made everyone comfortable in the process. She was very professional and super fun. Everyone in our wedding party loved interacting with her as a photographer. The wedding album turned out perfectly and she was more than accommodating with the change that I decided to make. We'll have her to thank for so many great photos in the years to come. I would highly recommend Fully Alive Photography!
5	I had the most wonderful experience working with Fully Alive Photography - Tracy is a gem, and her pictures are transcendental. If you want your moments unobtrusively captured and beautifully preserved, you can't go wrong hiring Fully Alive. Total win!
