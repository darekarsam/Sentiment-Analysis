2	Like most of the skuzzy strip clubs along Highland Drive, Foxy Girls reflects the kind of place you'd find in a town that's embarrassed to have a business where men pay to watch women take their clothes off [which is odd, because Vegas revels in skin].  It's hidden away in the industrial area, it's small, the dancers are run down and the drinks are overpriced.  That said, at least the place serves alcohol.  And when we were there, the dancers were good conversationalists and didn't immediately treat the customers like ATMs (that came later).
5	I love this club ! We are like the craziest girls in Vegas. I am a porn star so when I have fans that come into town and they want me to take them on a wild Vegas adventure our first stop is Foxys to meet real women. This club is BBW friendly
1	Naw, I went to this club at 10:31pm on a Saturday night and there were no strippers on the dance floor! I asked the bartender when they would come out and she was like, "I think they could be getting dressed." All of them??
