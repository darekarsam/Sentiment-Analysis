4	A great place to study!  There are lots of little nooks where you can get studying done, but the reading room on the second floor is the best spot.  It's usually very quiet and relaxing, with huge windows and plenty of room.  The Espresso Royale in the basement tunnel is nice for a caffeine fix if you're on a studying bender.The stacks are only accessible to students and staff.
3	The place definitely has an antiquated feel to it if you're into that sort of stuff. Is it a good place to study? Yup. The bathrooms are pretty small though.
4	I like this library, not all of them are quite. This one has a lot of information, or they will find it and transfer to to any University Library in University Library. Nice and clean in a nice area.
