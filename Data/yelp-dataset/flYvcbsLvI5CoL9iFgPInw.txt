5	Fresh seafood!Honest people. They refused to sell avalone, saying none they have is fresh enough. They picked every single avalone, to check if it's good.
5	Under the sea, nobody beat us, fry us and eat us.....Ummm wanna bet?Like fish?  This place has it ALL!  I wandered around like a kid in a candy store humming under the sea (Disney's Little Mermaid, you know the lobster sings it).  They have whole fish for sale, from salmon to texas red fish, cod, sardines, whole octopi and fish i've never even heard off.  They will also de-scale, clean, and fillet your fish of choice for no extra charge.You can also buy different kinds of oysters, mussels and scallops.  They also carry frozen products like ready made seafoood dishes and specialty items such as black truffles (25-99$ depending on size of jar).  Also octopus ink!  A little pricey (about 24$ a jar) but oh so good for making a traditional paella negro.  Fuggedaboutit'
5	Lovely people, tasty underwater friends, good prices, condiments and other stuffs.The formula for awesome.P.S. I just stuffed my face with Kumamoto oysters...I'm mega sad they're all gone...I see another trip to La Mer in the near future.
5	Fantastic selection of fresh fish. I normally buy my fish in mile end, but realize this is likely the source of most fish in Montreal. Lots if variety to pick from with a grocery to compliment the seafood selection. Very friendly staff. A must for seafood lovers who like to cook at home.
5	Best fish store in Mtl I have visited to date. Prices are fair given quality and freshness but a bargain it isn't (do you really want to eat cheap fish?).On site cleaning and prep should you purchase the entire fish but not know what to do with it.
