1	The staff was very nice however my nails looked horrible after I left! I went back to get my nails repaired and the woman that did my nails would not listen to my complaints. She filed my nails a little bit, cutting 3 of my fingers to the point where blood was drawn, and then said she was finished. She forgot to put the top coat on. She never apologize for cutting me and my nails still look horrible. I've only had them done for 5 days and they look AWFUL!
1	My sister and I was shopping at this mall a while back and I am now writing this review bc I just created a yelp account. So we went and try out this place for manicures. My gel manicure  was not done right I peel it the same day, it was such a rush but not as bad as my sister's lol she literally had a 5 min manicure, maybe even less. They didn't know we could understand Vietnamese be they thought we were Philippines and they were saying "these people are cheap, don't waste your time on them", how would they know that it was our first time there. #rude, I almost did not want to tip not bc they said that but bc it really was a horrible manicure but I still did. I still laugh at how quick my sister's manicure was up until this day lol it was like she sit down and then got up and was done, it sucked for me bc I was paying lol. I've got my nails at both salon in this mall before, the other one wasn't much better but they were nicer and the manicure was definitely longer than 5 min lol.
