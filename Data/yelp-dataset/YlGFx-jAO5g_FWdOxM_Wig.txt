1	Wouldn't stay here again if it was the last place on earth. Beware of unkept rooms and nasty conditions in the room. Had to wash all my stuff when I got home due to the room being so smelly and disgusting.
5	Stayed here for 2 weeks while the house was getting worked on. The stay was excellent. The workers are very friendly, and the pool is very clean. The only hotel that my parents and I came back to after searching for one closer to the house. Excellent stay for the price, and easily one of the best motels we stayed at.
