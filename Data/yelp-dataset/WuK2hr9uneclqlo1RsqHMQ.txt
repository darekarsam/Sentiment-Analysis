5	Dan, with Specialized Air, is the best.    He knows what he's doing, and gets the job done, at a fair price.  There's nothing worse than having your a/c go out in the summer...on a holiday.    He saved the day!
5	We couldn't be happier with Ultimate Air. Dan and his son Caleb are absolutely wonderful! Reliable, trustworthy, clean, and they really know their trade. Their prices and customer service can't be beat. Thank you Dan!!!
5	I have called Dan, of course when I need someone now! He has always come thru. My A/C 2 years ago, now no heat and it's 32 degrees inside! Ultimate Air came the day I called and took care of the problem. Thanks again Dan.
