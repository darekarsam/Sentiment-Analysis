5	I don't like writing reviews, so I'll make this short and sweet.  The dude put my new wiper blades on for me.  In the rain!  THAT my friends is customer service.  His name was Jeff.  He was awesome.  That's all you have to know.
5	I had trouble with my battery and had a good idea that I needed another one. I came here, someone tested the battery, I bought a new one and they installed the new one for free.The check and installation as I said was complementary. Friendly service and no pressure sales will have me coming back.
5	This place is A1 for customer service.  We first went to O'Really's and purchased a brake light and a headlight. When we asked them to put them in they said they couldn't because it was dark outside and we can come back when it's light and they could see what they could do. We instantly got a refund and went to this AutoZone. They were more than happy to help us out whether it was dark or not and a special thanks to Joshua for great customer service.
