3	Two (2) part review - Part 1 - We had originally gone to Y-Knot to obtain pricing for our wedding flowers.  BOY, am I glad I shopped around as the amount/type of flowers she quoted us was WAY overpriced!  $500+ for 1 bridal (5 stems of Callas), 4 bridesmaids (3 stems of Callas), 1 groom (1 Calla and spray), and 3 groomsmen (same as groom).  I could not believe it.  That appointment is what made me decide to meet with no less than 4 vendors for each category!  Even if the price was right, the flower lady put us off with her attitude.  I'm glad I did price around, because the place we went with (keep an eye out in a few months for that review!) we're getting more flowers for less money!  Cant beat that!   Part 2 - On the first visit, we learned that they also do invitations.  After looking through the books that first trip (same trip as flowers), we went back 3 months later and picked out our invitations.  The lady we dealt with for the invitations was very helpful, funny, and kind.  We were expecting to get the finished product back in 4 weeks, but she stated that we'll probably get them back prior to that.  Not even a week later (4 days to be exact), we got a call letting us know that the invitations were ready to be picked up!  Flowers - MEH. (1star)Invitations - W00H00!  (4 stars)Average - 3 starsThe lady we dealt with the 2nd time for the invitations and the quick order processing time was Y-Knot's only saving grace.
4	Needed linens for my event & these guys had a good selection at reasonable prices.  The linens looked great when we picked them up, staff was friendly and easy to work with.
5	We just called to reserve a margarita machine, tables and chairs for an upcoming Graduation party.  They were SO HELPFUL and FRIENDLY and was able to accommodate all our needs.  Thank you so much! Cant wait to pick it all up on Saturday.
