2	Expensive lunch meals.  Fried pickles were good.  Waitress messed up 2 orders out of 4.  Don't think I'll return.  Asked for no cheese waitress joked extra cheese, then brought my meal with cheese.  Better places to eat in area.
5	Great wings, salad, and beer.  The Cuban sandwich was good too.  What else could you ask for?
2	Highly overpriced and food was cold. Our waitress seemed confused and didn't know the menu. She had no idea about gluten free. The gluten free bun was awful.
4	I have been to the other Monks locations so I was excited when I heard they were coming Sun Prairie.  I was not disappointed.  We each orded something different and shared. I really liked my chicken sandwich and the fish tacos were great. My husband had a breakfast burger that while not something I would normally order, was pretty good.There really aren't many places in Sun Prairie to eat besides fast food and I can see Monks being one of our favorites. I took away a star because the dining room is packed with tables,  when full it is a tight squeeze to get around.
