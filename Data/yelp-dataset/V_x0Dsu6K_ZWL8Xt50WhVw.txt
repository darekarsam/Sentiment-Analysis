5	This place is new and very clean. All the employees are very professional and friendly. The prices can't be beat. I got a pedicure with salt and the paraffin wax for only $35!!! Excellent service!
4	I really love my acrylic/gel mani!! They have lasted really well considering I work in food. The staff is nice & do amazing work. Only issue I have is that the gel polish selection isn't that big. BUT I Will definitely be returning soon! Just a tip bring cash. (:
5	I just went there this past week because I needed to get my nails fixed asap after another nail salon completely botched my nails! Everything was nice and clean and I told the lady exactly what I wanted and that is EXACTLY what she did! She was gentle, precise and took her time to make sure they were perfect. I seriously am in love with how my nails came out and will definitely be going back!!!
5	Seriously love this place!' It's a small shop owned and worked by a husband/wife and I've seen 2 other pedicurist there. Every time I walk in they know be my name and I have rarely ever waited and never ore than 20 min. They have an awesome offer where you get a card and the mark each time you come in and after 10 you get a discount and I think you may as well if you pay cash. I have never had any lifting of my nails and I pick and ALWAYS get complimented on even when it's been 2 weeks and I need a fill.
5	Love this place!!! Clean and professional service. Can't beat the price! They do amazing jobs with my acrylic nails.
