1	I like to think of myself as an intelligent person, who can express his thoughts well with words.  But all that comes to mind about this joint is "comically bad."  I went with people from my office to this location for lunch.  It took a while for a server to come to our table (the place empty- only one other table of patrons) and it took a while for our drinks to arrive.  What truly made this experience was how long it took for us to get the check.  Our server just walked out.  Like, just walked out.  Our drinks never got refilled, we never got a "Hey folks, I'm heading out for a while," nothing.  So, we try to pay.  We go up to the counter, and say we want to pay.  The girl there just shrugs, yells back, "COUNTER!" and walks off.  No one comes from the back.  Someone from our group flags down someone who had on a PH shirt to try to get her to ring us up.This girl manages to get our ticket up, and asks for my ID to pay for a $5 pizza with my card.  If I stole a credit card, I would find better things to do with it than buy a small pepperoni from Pizza Hut.  The girl tries to ring up the order with my card.  She has to swipe it a number of times.  Then, turns around and walks off.  No explanation.  A woman returns with her, who is giving me seriously dirty looks, and asks to run my card again, that it didn't take before.  I hand over my card, and think, I can't wait to get to Yelp.
3	Pros: service has always been cool with us and they're really nice to kids. The flavored lemonades never stop flowing but it's $2 for stuffed crust, not 1 like the menu says. Pizza is pretty standard.
3	Usaully good service but tonight they burnt all the pizza .....then gave a half done pizza ....then ran out of thin crust ! Too much drama in one night....left my family hungry and waiting 1.5 hours for pizza.....really they didn't even comp the meal but rather gave a discount off the next pizza.......not sure if I'll ever be back!
