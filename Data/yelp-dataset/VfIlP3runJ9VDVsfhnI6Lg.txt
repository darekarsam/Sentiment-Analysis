3	I guess I can't hope for much from a gas station other than that they sell me gas and offer a cool beverage if I need one.  This place does both of those things.  It's actually a fairly large station.But, I wasn't nearly as happy here as I am at my local Arco, which is still just moderately happy.  I waited quite a while for one of the three available cashiers to acknowledge me.  When one finally did, she looked at me sideways when I paid, but then again I did pay with some $2 bills.  It was very difficult to get in and out of the parking lot during rush hour, because it's on a busy corner with just-awkwardly-enough placed driveways.If you're paying cash, it's some of the cheapest gas in the neighborhood!

After getting burned by using my debit card at a gas station (card info got swiped and some foreign interest tried to take me for everything I have and then some) I will never use debit at stores/gas stations again. I'm so happy they made the update!
