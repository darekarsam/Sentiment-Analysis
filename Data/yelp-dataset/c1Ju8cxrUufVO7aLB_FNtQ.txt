3	Honestly have experienced better. The management company (@UDR) is publicly traded so no surprise that interests are investors and not residents. Sierra Foothills, is not great at communication or transparency. Just a month ago notices were placed that they would be entering the dwellings for inspection - made me feel like a cell toss in Shawshank - come to later find out it was a prospective buyer of the property. My mailbox has been broken for 5 weeks; no notification about resolution or ETA. The USPS says it's up to the property to repair - UDR says it's up to the USPS. The front pool and fitness center is great and wonderful to spend time in and the clubhouse is 24 hour which is nice. All in all, the community is kept and it's where I call home, but let Sierra Foothills be a  "come back to re-review" in your apartment searching. Service request resolution time is quick, but overall management practice and communication could do with some work.
1	looks can be deceiving.  i've only been here a month and have never been able to park in my reserved spot as movers, cable installers air conditioning people constantly park there and management will do nothing.  almost all gates are broken.  so much for security.  I asked for a repair and received a note it was complete.  no it wasn't even done.  tons of people moving out constantly.  I was never given the gate codes to the pool and such.  the pool is brown on bottom and the hot tub does not work.  cant wait till my lease is up.
1	Rented here for a couple years. Hostile managers, unnecessary confrontations. Rented month-to-month before departure, and they never made the exit process clear, though I told them my planned departure time six and four months in advance. Slapped me with an extra months rent ($900), claiming I'd missed some evacuation notice deadline. I didn't pay, and they've been pursuing me for a $4000 claim since!
