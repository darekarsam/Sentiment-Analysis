4	Latin cuisine with an obvious but elegant French twist. It's definitely not easy to get that right, but the 2 entrees and 2 mains that we tasted tonight were just perfect. There's an excellent cook at work. How would you marry impeccably cooked magret de canard with arepas? Well, Julieta can do that, and more.The wine selection is smart and affordable. Service is knowledgeable and friendly. The place feels a bit cramped and seating could be more comfortable. But I warmly recommend this place all the same.This time I went for a late dinner. But next time I will certainly try it for a brunch and report here! I attached a picture of the current brunch menu, by the way.
5	Best brunch in the neighbourhood. Every time I go there for brunch, I feel sorry for the people waiting an hour in line next door. I feel like waiving them all over to Julieta. Wonderful, quaint atmosphere and lovely service. They offer a non-traditional brunch, which I always welcome, and is super tasty. They label themselves as latino, but I'm not sure which country specifically. It's our go to brunch place, and have never been disappointed. Looking forward to trying their dinner!
