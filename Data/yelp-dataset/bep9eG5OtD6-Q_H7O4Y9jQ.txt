5	I came back into town catching up with some girlfriends and decided to get our pedicures done. We happened to see this new place and it was beyond amazing! They owners was so nice and made our stay enjoyable. We will definitely be coming back soon!
5	I really enjoy coming here to get my nails done. They do a wonderful job on both pedis and nails. It is nice and clean inside. They are very friendly and welcoming. It is worth it to stop in and try it out.
5	Went Saturday at 1130am. I got TyTy and she was super sweet. This place is only 3 months old but she and her husband are very experienced. I got a gel manicure only $22 and that was after removing the acrylics i had on. She made sure it was perfect! This is the only place i have been satisfied with so far. I am definitely coming back.
5	The prices are very reasonable, and the spa pedicure is super thorough for being the basic pedicure. The place is also very clean, which is super important to me. They even offer a student discount. The staff is very friendly. My only complaints were that the gel manicure didn't last as long as other gel manicures I have had and I think they put the wrong polish color on me, but I would still go there again. As long as I continue to have positive experiences, this will be my go to salon.
