5	Everyone at the dealership was extremely friendly and easy to work with.  They were able to deliver exactly what I wanted in a timely fashion.  My father and friends of the family have already dealt with Classic Chevrolet and I am happy to say that I deal with them too...
1	My husband had his car in this shop for body work.  The body work was fine, but this dealership has a petty thief on their staff. He realized when he needed to charge his phone that his mobile charger was missing. We didn't automatically think it was stolen until we realized the loose change he keeps in there for tolls was also missing. This person didn't steal a lot, but it is the principle of it.  I would never use this dealership for anything.
1	I had a radio upgrade (PDIM) unit that I installed myself, and I took it to Classic Chevrolet, to get the radio reprogrammed, which is a common 20 minute procedure at dealerships. Over the course of the 3 hours I was there, I heard the following:- What's a PDIM? (Should have been my first clue to leave)- This isn't a GM part. (It is)- Can you come to the service center and explain to our installer how to reprogram the radio? (Even after I printed off the instruction page and gave them to the service guy when he took my keys)- You need a code from GM to reprogram the radio. (You don't)And my favorite.....- It's reprogrammed. (It wasn't)I spent three hours at a dealership for a job that requires them to plug a box into a cable and hit a button. And they still didn't get it right.My money was refunded after I asked the service manager if he knew what a PDIM was. He said yes, so I asked him what it did. His response? "It connects the things." After asking what things, he just looked confused and refunded my money. Too bad he can't refund my three hours.
