3	Great diner. I ended up in this neighborhood while shopping for Halloween decor.  We were hungry so we stopped at this little diner. The place was clean and the staff was accommodating to us and our very large stroller.  I ordered a grilled cheese with curly fries and my husband had a bacon burger. The grilled cheese was good (kind of hard to mess up bread butter and cheese but it does happen).  My husband says his burger, for the price, was excellent.  No surprises here just good food served by friendly people in a clean environment. Solid 3 stars.
4	Old fashion cooking like you used to have when you were a kid.  Nice, clean friendly service.  Not the best neighborhood but trustworthy that you'll be served a yummy hot plate of food.Always filled with regulars and enough room to welcome large families on a busy Sunday.
