5	We found this by using a search engine (don't recall which). What a fantastic place to stay! We stayed here for 7 days Sept. 2012 and were more than pleased. The people at the Reception desk were fantastic and very helpful and knowledgeable; getting taxis, giving directions, smiling. The housekeeping staff was great as were the servers in the dining room. It's a bed & breakfast that also serves lunch and dinner, plus has a bar for late night snacks. Breakfast is included in the rate; you pay for lunches and dinners. We ate lots of meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) there; breakfast is kinda typical Scottish (includes tomatoes & beans along with eggs, sausage, bacon plus cereals, yogurt & fruit). Lunch was sandwiches and a few other things. Dinners could be fish/chips or steak or chicken stuffed with haggis, even duck.Internet service only in lobby or bar area, but they also provided a computer by reception.Taxi to Edinburgh City Center was about 10 pounds or so (the streets were torn up; with that & traffic it could vary slightly, but not by too much.We would definitely stay there again!Stayed September 2012, traveled with family
