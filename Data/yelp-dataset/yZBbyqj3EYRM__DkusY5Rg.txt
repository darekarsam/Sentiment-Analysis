4	Great service, I took my car there and they were able to get the trim piece I have destroyed and they got the paint matched.  Great service, friendly. Met the owner and he was great.
5	Staff was helpful and friendly.  Owner arrived and gave me extra help, including a small fix for which I was not charged.  They gave me honest advice about how to save money and how not to save money, including advising me to get one part at the dealer instead of buying aftermarket from them.  I was impressed all around.
5	Amazing service!!! I had a referral here from my attorney because of my accident. Someone ran a stop sign and hit my drivers side pretty bad. They did a full inspection of my car. After everything was cleared with the insurance, they started right away. The whole process took a little over two and a half weeks. Austin is awesome, he always called to keep me updated on my car. I had a peace of mind that my car was in good hands. My whole drivers door had to be replaced, an alignment had to be done, and a couple other things needed work. When I got my car back it looked as if nothing happened. I was definitely more than satisfied.
