5	On the surface this place doesn't seem like it should be any different from your average book store, but I walked out with way more things that I would have expected. They had all sorts of excellent books, not always 2010 releases, that I figured I'd have to order via online catalog.I wish more average book stores followed whatever selection magic this store does.
4	When Paragraphe opened in the 80s it was one of the very first bookstore cafes in North America. Anglos were leaving Quebec, but the founders decided to aim to be an epicenter of English writing in Montreal, especially local writing. It's tiny and the cafe is a Second Cup now and Paragraphe itself is now owned by Archambault, but the selection is still excellent. A good number of passionate McGill profs choose Paragraphe to supply their classes, which helps keep important works on the shelves, and Paragraphe hosts literary launches and readings by important local authors throughout the year.
