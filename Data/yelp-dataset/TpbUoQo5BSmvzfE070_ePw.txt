4	In 2010 I had my Tattoo done here. They were very professional and took the time to advise me about size, position and finances. I brought in my own design and he was very helpful in getting it set up and inked. Due to the fact it was on the side of my neck I needed 2 'top ups' which were done 4 & 8 weeks apart. I am since thinking of going for my 3rd tattoo and to do it here again. They are not open in the evenings nor on a Sunday.
