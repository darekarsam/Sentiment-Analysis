3	I like the Boris beer and this brand new spot they've got on St Denis is bright and clean and modern and has a nice sunken front patio, and great seating along the pretty alley on the side. But it's too many TVs and metal chairs inside for me. The shrimp we tried was a little fishy and disappointing. The quesadillas were delish, as were the veggie dumplings. The jazz duo was confusing in that space, sort of like the all around the world menu: this brand new space opened by a cool brewer is like a puppy tripping on all its paws figuring out what it's going to do with itself. Adorable, as were all the friendly eager staff.

The vegetarian quesadilla and the dumplings were fab, but the shrimp skewers need some work as they tasted fishy and the mango topping was bland. Sitting at the bar is extra fun as one of the bar tv's is a direct feed of the outdoor patio: was fun watching the patio folk get sloppy and almost knock over tables and think no one noticed.

We sat on the patio and even from outside we found the music (coming from inside) very loud and being non-smokers, the fact that the patio is open to smokers will probably be a reason why next time we will go somewhere else. Is there any way to enjoy a sunny patio without having to breath in everyone's smoke?
