1	I went into Transformations for a consultation & the experience was horrible. The facility is gorgeous but the people, especially Dr. Afifi, were unkind, impatient, & had very little knowledge  of the procedure I was interested in or any people skills. Do not use this clinic!
5	I had a couple of elective surgeries completed by Transformations (Dr. Siebert). The staff is amazing, and worked with me even though I lived in NYC and was traveling to Wisconsin for surgery. (Wisconsin was far more cost effective, approx. 1/3 the cost of NYC). I could not be happier with the results and would recommend this facility to anyone.
5	I had an elective cosmetic procedure done at Transformations recently and was very pleased with the entire experience. I had booked a consultation with Dr. Siebert in May, the appointment was booked out until July (its because that man is that good. Trust me). It was worth the wait. During my consultation he answered every one of my questions and was patient with me during the entire thing. All of his staff members that I encountered were as well. I was more than pleased with my consultation and ultimately decided to pursue the procedure at this place. I then had a pre-op appointment with Dr. Sieberts PA who treated me with the exact same professional demeanor as Dr. Siebert. My surgery was scheduled for beginning of September and went better than I had anticipated. The entire peri-operative staff is caring and made sure my boyfriend was kept in the loop with all that was going on with my care. I cant say enough about Dr. Siebert, his team, and the transformations center. I am a member of the healthcare industry myself (and those related to surgical services) so I feel that I already had a very critical eye going into this. Not that I ever plan on having another elective surgery performed, but if I ever did, I would want it to be with Dr. Siebert and the staff at Transformations.
