5	Best Aikibudo in Arizona. I so miss training here on a weekly basis but I no longer live in the Valley. I still make it back almost monthly. Great people to train with and excellent instructors. I learned so much and am so appreciative of all the instruction I have received and continue to receive. If you want to train in an effective Martial Art based in traditional Japanese martial arts and taught in a modern educational system, this is the dojo to do so.
5	This is an awesome dojo full of energetic and enthusiastic training, defined by a continuous pursuit of excellence.  Quality people, exemplifying unique qualities in a collaborative journey toward learning and development.
5	I wouldn't want to train anywhere else. The instructors are truly dedicated to the art and have a unique way of training that I don't think you will find anywhere else. The purpose of instruction there is not just to uplift the student, but also the instructor, making everyone involved in the training highly engaged and invested in what is happening on the mat.I have trained with some of these guys since 1998 and they are the most respectful, quality and skilled people I have ever trained with.The system taught at Senshinkan is practical and effective. It doesn't matter if you are young or old, fit or out of shape. This system allows you to become a competent practitioner as long as you are willing to put in the time on the mat.
