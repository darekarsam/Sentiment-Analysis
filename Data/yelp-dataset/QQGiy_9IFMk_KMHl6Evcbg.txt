5	My favorite place to eat on campus! They offer an assortment of fresh paninis, wraps and salads. Definitely fresher than any other place at laurier, they have board games and you can enjoy a beer on their patio if the weather is nice! I highly suggest having the roasted red pepper soup.

Also a great place for a light meal, though there needs to be more variety when it comes to on lower-fat items.It's proof that a student-run cafe -- in this case, run by the grad students' association --  run by a local caterer beats out a corporate service in food quality, service and atmosphere. This should become the norm in all universities.In my e-book, Food for City Building, I argue that cafes serve multiple functions above and beyond selling food. Above all, they serve as a "third place" -- after home and work -- that becomes a community fixture because people can drop by knowing they can either lounge around or meet friends or do a little work and feel as comfy as they would at home. Students, who face multiple stresses, need a third place more than most people, so it's crucial that places like this survive and thrive.A nice feature is that fair trade coffee is on offer -- very good taste, too.
