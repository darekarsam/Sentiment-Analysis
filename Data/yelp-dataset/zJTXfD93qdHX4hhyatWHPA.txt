2	Not a great experience. They are expensive. They know nothing about how the Acuras, so they can't even say if they have fixed it correctly.I took my car in because the seat heater broke and the dealership referred me here. They fixed half of the heater and called the job complete because they didn't bother to check that it worked. The repair took almost 2 weeks to complete.They wanted $1000 to take apart my door and vacuum broken glass out of it, so I chose not to have this done by them.They are not friendly and tend to argue. They are disorganized and cannot say if a job is complete or not, or give any status if you call.
5	Chris and his staff were so helpful to me this week.  They were kind, efficient and informed me (with updated emails) of the estimate, progress and completion of my repairs.  I appreciated their professionalism and would highly recommend them.
5	I had a great experience!  Staff was amazing!  Would recommend to anyone.  Being a very busy parent loved the fact that I received updates via e-mail vs. having to wait by my phone and having to step out of daughter's dance classes to take the calls on progress of my car.  When I picked up my Honda, I was so pleased with the work that they had done!
