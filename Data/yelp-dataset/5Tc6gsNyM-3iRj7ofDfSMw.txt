1	Officially 13.5 hours late!!! I called yesterday at 5pm (tire works closed @7) they quoted me hour to an hour & a half...the driver called me at 730pm and asked my location, i told him not to bother because the shop was already closed. So he set me up with a 7am appt. At 815am i awoke with a very rude vmail from them saying I gave the incorrect gate code & they were leaving my area. Funny thing is, I DON'T HAVE A GATE CODE!!!! So Tire works called them, it's going to be another hour and a half, so I called another company. Let's see just for fun how long it takes them this time around to come get my car that isn't here.... jack***es!
1	Terrible service. Girls on the phone need some lessons in customer service. If you're unhappy working there then quit.
1	Two hours after I call, they show up. Vegas isn't that big! Luckily I called Tire Works, and they were able to save me. Avoid abc!
1	I don't know if all of the ABC Towing companies in Vegas are related, but I just had a terrible experience with one of them.  They told me when they could arrive and I waited and waited.  When I called the company, the lady on the phone was incredibly rude.  She said they'd be there in 20 minutes.  They weren't.  I waited and waited.  I called again and she was even more rude.  She told me they'd be there in 5 minutes.  They weren't.  I waited and waited.  I called again.  More rudeness.  This went on forever.  When the guy finally arrived he said they don't communicate well over there.  TERRIBLE customer service.   I'll never use them again.
1	Been trying to deal with them for two days and they've been nothing but rude and disrespectful and were going to charge me $85 after they put my car in a bad location. They weren't cooperative in any way and the dispatch was anything but helpful. They told me I had to wait 3 hours before a truck would get to me. I'll never use ABC towing even through AAA. These people don't care about anyone but what money they put in their pockets.
