4	Since Monk Blvd is quite remote, not that populated I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the service, ambiance, and food here. Generally people slack if they don't think they'll get much business anyway.. not so for this little hole in the wall!They serve liquor, beer, etc. along with coffee (which can either get 1 free refill, or 3 depending on what size you get).I've tried their cranberry cookie as well as their chocolatier, both fresh and quite good! (make sure you get the chocolatier toasted) Tried the turkey and mango wrap, also decent, and neatly made and served. I never much frequented cafe's, but at least in my experience food was never so "neatly" made and presented.I agree with other reviews - avoid the chocolate milk because it's *way* too sweet, generic grocery store kind; but thats about the only negative I think of; their service is excellent, ambiance is great, staff hard-working. Never tried their hot cooked meals, but am planning to treat myself to it soon.They have var. types of tables and seating arrangements, (one looong bench, some window seats, stools, some more private workspaces) but the place isn't too big either.  Only thing - wifi can be annoying - you may need to log on to it every 30 minutes or so. Still. Love this joint!
