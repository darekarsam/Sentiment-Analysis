4	Dockside has been a fresh seafood staple on the Eastside of Charlotte for as long as I can remember.  Long lines will greet you if you get there during peak time, but they clean your fish pretty fast.  Of course they have all the basic seafood offerings by the pound and it's as clean as a fresh seafood spot can be.
5	I have been coming to this seafood spot off and on since moving to Charlotte in 2007 and inquiring of one of my cousins of a great seafood market.  I haven't been here much lately, truly due to divorcing a few years back and just not cooking fish like that,  some might call it lazy,  but in recent months,  I have reintroduced myself to dockside and happy to keep our connection strong.   This store is clean,  well stocked, unless you show up late afternoon after the crowds hit it, staffed with some great folks who will work to accommodate your desires.  Fantastic Eastside seafood spot.
5	I absolutely love this place. This is where oil prefer to buy my seafood honestly . There are lots of places around Charlotte that specialize in seafood but honestly the prices are crazy. Here very reasonable. I recently bought salmon here and they Alice up the amount you want and you can have them debone or not debone the fish, it's up to you. It's also very close to my home. So if your in the area no more high priced fresh seafood. They also have some cool Asian food here :)
