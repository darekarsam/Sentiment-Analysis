5	I highly recommend Basc for all your accounting needs! They are professional and courteous and can put your mind at ease during tax season, thanks basc!
5	BASC Expertise is the most thorough and experienced accounting service I've ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  Deirdre made what seemed like a nightmare into a very easy process.  Highly recommended for all accounting and tax work!
5	I've been working with the girls at BASC Expertise for years now. They set up my professional organization paperwork and tax paperwork for my small business. They have always been very professional and thorough with all of my bookkeeping needs as well. I highly recommend BASC Expertise to anyone looking for a great experience, expert advice, and very friendly atmosphere.
1	I am learning that finding a competent, professional and reliable accountant is an unbelievably difficult task. I am looking for someone new as my current accountant routinely takes in excess of one week to reply to the simplest questions. I contacted BASC and met with Deirdre and all seemed well, until they asked me to fill out their questionnaire - the standard form they all use asking about all of your assets and personal information. Unfortunately, instead of sending me a blank form, they accidentally sent me another client's completed form - including all of their financial information, their social security numbers and their ban account numbers! I was aghast - I get that mistakes happen, but this one I thought pretty egregious.
5	BASC Expertise does all my accounting and payroll work.  They are professional and very timely.  The entire staff is great to work with and Deirdre is always willing to answer questions and provide guidance on any matter I might have.  I highly recommend them and the rest of the team.
