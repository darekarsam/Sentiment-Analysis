1	Wow, what a horrible restaurant, why does everyone think they can cook?  Ok lets start from the top, the hostess seemed really put off that we wanted dinner.  With a huff she sat us down.  The food?  Oh my, it's been a while since I've such slop.  The calimari was not edible, over cooked, tasteless.  Oh and what's that dip?  Mayonaise, from a jar.  Seriously the food tasted like they went to the market, and not the upscale one, bought some food, unpackaged it, marked up the cost 1000% and called it Italian.  Don't bother.  I actually left 95% of the food on the plate, paid and left.  oh well
2	The fact that I can't even muster any particularly convincing dislike for Prezzo isn't a good sign as far as I'm concerned. It's anodyne pseudo-Italian food served in a non-threatening, tastefully bland environment, for a not unreasonable price.The food itself is safe enough - never actively horrible, because it's all kept pretty simple. Everything is a bit overcooked (presumably on the basis that this is less likely to offend than if it were considered undercooked) and the dishes seem to be straight from a British Italian menu of 20 years ago (spicy chicken penne, anyone?).I had slightly spongy spaghetti, in a lake of runny tomato sauce, with a few overcooked king prawns, side salad and a pot of dressing which (had I used it) would have completely overpowered everything else on the plate.Pizzas are available in various permutations including low-fat, on some sort of non-pizza flatbread, or as something called 'The Executive' (reinforcing the impression that you've fallen through a yuppie time-warp).This is the kind of place you might bring your great aunt - the one with the funny tummy, who generally doesn't like foreign food - or book an office Christmas party, after giving up on getting people to agree to something more interesting.
