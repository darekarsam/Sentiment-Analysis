5	Roses you say? This place has the most beautiful ones I've EVER seen in Madison. Every time I order from them, I'm not disappointed.Yes, I'm picky. I'm picky about what goes in the vase. No RED roses, leather leaf, babies breath, or carnations for this girl. When I called George's to place my order, they let me speak directly to a designer. The recipient of the flowers was thrilled and I was thrilled with the excellent customer service, and product. If it's Roses you want, in the most intersting, elegant, lovely, arrangement, or just by themselves, call George's. And please, no carnations, leather leaf, babies breath or RED roses. There is so much more out there if you just ask.
5	I went here to get a dozen roses for my 5 year anniversary: 7 red, 5 white. It was one of the most beautiful bunch I have ever bought. And! And, when I picked them up, the arrangements and other items in the store were equally beautiful and well put together. Go here before anywhere else in Madison. I've tried 4-5 locations and this is tops.
5	I never buy flowers so I had no idea what I was doing when I went into the shop today. I was approached right away by a lady asking if I needed help.  I wish I remembered her name, she has shoulder length dark hair. Well I definitely needed help and she did a wonderful job. We picked out a bouquet, stem by stem. She was so nice and helpful and everyone else who was working was great as well. Next time I need flowers I am going straight to George's!
