5	I should start here. I love Tapeo. I have for years. I find that their passion for the place and the food is infectious. But now I have to add an extra night to my trip to Montreal. The reason is Meson. The restaurant is great. I love the room, I love the food, and I love the service. Sebastien and team have done it again.   I think it's because they just work so hard. And really love what they do. The menu is very fresh. I love the fact the restaurant is in a real neighborhood. If I lived in Montreal I'd be there a lot. Now I just have to settle for being there when I am in town
4	Had the squid ink fish and chips-- absolutely divine! We also had the most charming and hilarious waiter ever-- he really took it up a notch! Plus, this place is absolutely stunning! Worth the trip-- I will definitely head back to try more of the awesome on the menu!

4	Money money money moneeeeey, moooonaaaaayyyy. Its a bit pricey but, BUT, super good. I had the tartare and my man had a cocas. Its a Spanish pizza. Both were solid. The mains are big portions so get ready to get your eat on. They spent coin on the decor and its a nice ambiance so, congrats. Cheesecake was yummy. Great date spot. You'll get a second date unless you're boring, Meson can't help you. Sorryyyyyy. (Not sorry). Definitely will be back to try more of the seafood dishes. A bientot!
