5	Love them.  Love Them. Love Them.  From the moment you walk in, friendly faces, current movies, and a giant wave to surf greets you.  The staff is great, The Dentist is great!  My 9 year old actually wants to go to the dentist.  They even have TV's on the ceiling with Apple TV so the kid can watch almost anything they want.  Afterward, they have toys and stickers and toothbrush kits to take home.I wish they had dentists like this when I was a child.  Maybe I wouldn't have bit mine.
5	My daughter had her first dentist appt today and it was a great experience.  The place is very kid friendly and really helped my daughter to not be as scared.  In the room they have a TV above the chair so they can watch it while they get the work done.  The MA was amazing,  she was so nice and my daughter felt very comfortable (she's only 4yrs old). I Def recommend this pediatric dentist!
5	Just recently switch my daughter  to this office. Dr.Jensen is great.,professional and very easy to communicate with. I was referred to him by her orthodontist. The office staff is great too, pleasant, patient and very helpful. It was a great decision to switch my daughter to Smile Reef. I would higl recommend this office.
