1	I have never been more disrespected by an auto shop.  Not only did I have to take my car back in 3 times but I was verbally abused by the owner and a mechanic.  I was told to never come back and believe me that won't be a problem.
1	BEWARE!!!!!!! This place is a total joke!!!!!  The owner is extremely rude and told me to go fuck myself when I called if you want to go to a place with customer service like that go right ahead but if there attitude is that horrible i could only image there work!!
5	These guys are really cool!  Great customer service!
