3	Look, there's no doubt that this place is beautiful. The food is good, I work right next door, so I went over to try out a soup. It was delisious, fresh, & pretty big. But I can't help but feel out of place when I go there, like I am not snooty enough and that the prices are a little steep.I much rather visit across the street to Anton & James.
4	Located in the heart of the Quartier des spectacles, this modern little place offers a wide variety of options for lunch.We got one of their delicious turkey cranberry salads as well as a chicken tortillas and some Danish pastries. The portions were big and the food was fresh and well seasoned.Overall it was an enjoyable experience although it was on the pricey side.
