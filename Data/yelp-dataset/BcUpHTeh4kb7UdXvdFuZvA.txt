4	Great service., healthy as always.
1	I start with a 5 and then see how much things go.  So -1 for employees being so slow.  Management needs to get them some red bull.  -1 out of new bread and other types.  -1 out of sweet tea.  -1 out of some cookie types. so that leaves them with 1 star sad but coworkers say this is typical there. There are a lot of places to eat in the area, try them first.  (2:30 pm 7-7-14)
2	Probably the worst Subway in Charlotte. Not only are the staff slow and throw subs together sloppily, the guy on the checkout made me want to never go there again - he had disgusting, dirty long (I mean LONG!) fingernails and looked like he hadn't changed his clothes for a week. I was wondering if they had just got the nearest homeless guy to man the checkout.The food was the same as any other subway, but no care was taken to put the sandwich together.
