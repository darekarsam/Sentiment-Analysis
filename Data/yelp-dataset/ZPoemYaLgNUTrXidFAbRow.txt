5	My family and I have been training at Lopez Martial Arts for close to 4 years. The instruction given by Chris Lopez is second to non. If you're looking to train traditional martial arts, Brazilian jiu jitsu, or kickboxing in a relaxed ego free family friendly environment this is the place. Come in and check it out.
5	I've been involved in Martial Arts for over thirty years and have known Instructor Chris Lopez for over 20.  He is by far one of the most talented Martial Artists I've ever met, period.  An even better instructor.  Couldn't give a higher rating to anyone or a better recommendation. Call him today and schedule a class.
5	Chris is a great guy who is super knowledgable and a talented teacher. He has been instructing my son in Jiu-Jitsu and Tai-Kwan-Do for four years.  I could not recommend him more.
