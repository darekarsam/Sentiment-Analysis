5	Take a trip to Italy in this authentic cafe where regulars are met with a 'Bon journo' and their preferred espresso concoction and visitors are made to feel right at home by Piero and his team. I went in for a cappuccino, thinking I might take it to go; I wound staying for hours and feeling like I'd begun new friendships. Stand at the bar, grab a chair, or relax in their outdoor patio and take a sip of Little Italy.
4	VIBE Very old school Italian coffee joint across the street from Impasto. Connected to the restaurant on the corner from the back (not part of the same resto family, not that I know of). But the best part is that there's casino machines in the back! Awesome. I DRANKI got the Old School. Kind of like a sweeter latte. Yum. Tasty. You can tell these guys are pros. And look for the $75 bill behind the counter. OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK I wish I could see more of the atmosphere here during the week. I feel like it's the old days of Montreal a la Duddy Kravitz but with Italian characters.
5	Their coffee is perfection, and the charm of this place will surely put a smile on your face. Looking forward to returning regularly.
4	Great little old school Italian 'bar' where one finds simply delicious coffees. Located a skip hop away from Milanos grocery store. Grab a quick latte to go or have a seat and relax. Great little place!
