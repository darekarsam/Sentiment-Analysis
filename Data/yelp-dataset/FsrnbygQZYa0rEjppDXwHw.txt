4	4 Stars because the Pasta Bowls truly ROCK!  This is not your dads Dominos Pizza, they have really changed.  The Sandwiches are good, the pasta bowls are killer and the pizza is MUCH better.  Service is pretty good as well.  The online ordering process is pretty cool.  It updates the status of your order from prep to baking to checking to delivery.  For delivery food you really cant beat it & I never thought I would say that about Dominos.  Good Job.
4	Consistently better over the past couple years. Hard to give any corporate pizza joint a 5 star rating, but they are definitely a good place to pick up some inexpensive eats.
1	I can't eat this pizza again. It was overdone and the sauce was not very good. Service was great though.
2	This is the slowest most unorganized domino's I have ever been in. Service is terrible. They can't even fold the boxes right. There aren't many pizza joints to choose from out here but I wouldn't choose this one. Also when did they start charging for crushed red peppers and parm. cheese. That is just dumb.
5	We LOVE this Dominos!! Its the only Pizza Place we ever choose to order our pizza-They are always right on time and the Delivery Drivers are top notch!!
2	Every job we work, for most of us get trained on being professional and taught that the customer is the one who keeps the business profitable. The rude woman on the phone tonight who was rude on the phone and messed our order up after trying to re-explain what we wanted over and over caused us to not order from this dominoes again. Thanks rude woman! Still like dominoes though.
