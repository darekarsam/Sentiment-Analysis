4	Great stop during your stay at SLS, plus it's free! I was able to experience the Iconic Images Gallery a few times, both before and after it's completion and I must say it's a great reason to start using the hashtag,  #GalleryPorn. The works of Terry O'Neill are truly amazing and a fantastic glimpse into the golden age of Hollywood, the grimy British music uprising of the 60's, and the soft side of Agent 007. The works here are for sale, but they may put a hefty dent in your wallet.  I suggest browsing the halls of the Iconic Images Galley and if your eyeballs are still hungry for more beautiful and thought provoking imagery, purchase one of the awesome coffee table books for sale at the gallery. RUMOR MILL: I hear they may start offering a "Champagne Sunday Stroll" in the gallery.
3	Upstairs at the SLS there is a gallery on your way to the buffet- or the space that served as such before it was "temporarily" closed. A series of 30 or so photos, mostly by Terry O'Neill with a few by Douglas Kirkland and a few others, are all of former stars- hence the gallery name. Photos of Sophia Loren, Mick Jagger, the Beatles, and other musicians and actors grace the walls in black and white, free to peruse if you just know where they are.
