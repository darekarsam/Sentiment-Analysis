1	I went There many times. Price is gd but i need to go there twice to get what i want. English speaking makes it even harder to communicate  n getting an.expected hair cut . When i told i didn't get my desired look some stafs were rude. A professional did my hair relly wrong i went a student to get it fixed. N the professional was very upset at me. I don't wan to go bk.
