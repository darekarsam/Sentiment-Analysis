5	AWESOME COURSE!!!!This course is totally worth taking!!! If you don't know how to ride a motorcycle this is perfect for you! There is a whole weekend involved. They go over all the material and they make sure you know everything for your written test. Then they literally teach you how to ride in two days! My instructors Michael and Jerry were awesome guys! They know motorcycles for sure! Everyone in my class passed and got our cards! I love this and recommend this place to everyone! Get out there and have fun!
5	I highly recommend for beginners the trainers are very efficient and very patient I give this place 5 star's all the way .
