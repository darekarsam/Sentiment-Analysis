4	My company used Ken's services to repair desks & chairs that had been nicked and scratched in a move. He fixed everything to perfection. I would highly recommend his company for repairs and touch-ups.
4	Super nice guy. Found Ken online. Showed up when he said he would. Repaired a crack in a drawer I accidentally dropped on concrete during a move. I would use him again if needed.
5	I found Ken online and my wife and I hired him to fix our couch. The frame had cracked when I accidentally stepped on it when taking curtain rods down in our last house before moving to Charlotte from Washington, DC. I contacted him before we moved and sent him pictures. He was able to give me a quote and estimated that it would take him under two hours to fix the break. He showed up exactly when he said he would and knocked it out in about an hour. Well worth it!
