5	Great customer service! Very knowledgeable staff. They will explain everything to you and get your phone all set up.
1	I would give this store no stars if I could. Sales representatives do not even acknowledge your existence when you walk in. They are incompetent with the technology and simply direct you to Apple, the customer service number or literally any resource they can to avoid giving any sort of effort.
1	I hate that most of my reviews are complaints.  I'd like to think of them as warnings not complaints.  So I'm going to warn you about this store.  The sales people lie, and lie.  No matter how untrue, unethical the lie may be.  As soon as you sign the contract it doesn't matter.  Read the fine print, don't listen to a word they say.  Just today, I went in there to check out the Note 4.  A salesmen named Kenny said that Samsung had discontinued all Note 4's until they worked out factory defects and that's why they didn't have any(what??).  In May I bought the Samsung galaxy s5 and my Mom an iPhone.  First they told me they don't have two year contracts and they only had the framily plan.  Lie!  You can still get two year plans online.  Then they said my monthly plan would be the same as it was.  Lie!  I pay almost three hundred dollars a month.  All I can say is read the fine print and buy your device/devices online at the company website.  Get the two year plan it's a much better deal and you won't have to deal with this place.
