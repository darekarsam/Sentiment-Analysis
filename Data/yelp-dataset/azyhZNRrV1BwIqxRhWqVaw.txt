5	I've been stay there for 2 nights. Nice decoration in guest room, feel like home. It's a lil bit small but have everything you need.
3	Very small rooms but nice and clean. They do have good breakfast. The only complaint would be the the stink of smoking in the lobby and the floor I stayed in.
4	Five stories, interior entrances, elevator.If you are not familiar with the Sleep Inn concept, the room design is compact.  My queen bed room included a shower only bathroom (the standard for Sleep Inn), comfortable bed, hi def tv, microfridge and strong wifi signal.  Pleasant two night stay.  Everything was clean, heat/air worked well, and the surroundings were quiet.  Hot water did take a little longer than expected to reach a comfortable temperature for a shower.The free breakfast buffet did include eggs and sausage and yogurt along with cereal, breads, and fruits.In front of the hotel are a Bojangle's and a Shoney's restaurant.Nice lodging option for this area,
