1	WORST SERVICE EVER!! I had ordered a meal from Pizza Hut about 45 minutes from when they said it would be delivered. They said it would arrive around 7:00pm so around 6:30pm I waited by the door looking out the window with credit and cell phone in hand. With no sign of any delivery driver (let alone a knock on the door), I called Pizza Hut around 7:15pm. They claimed that the driver had come twice already and they were not able to get a hold of me. After arguing with the Manager (who was completely unprofessional) he hung up on me. Never again will I be ordering from this place.
2	Went here for the lunch buffet, which was only available for a short duration during summer I believe.It was not too expensive however there is not much to choose from, only four types of pizza were provided along with a salad bar. The salad bar was very small and only had one dressing, and the only vegetable was Roman lettuce.The pizza tasted alright, albeit it boggles me that they put hot-dog sausages in their crust, which were very dry and tasteless.Their ice cream machine didn't work :(
4	Pizza is great!!and the delivery is fast,but the guy who pick up the phone is very stupid....
