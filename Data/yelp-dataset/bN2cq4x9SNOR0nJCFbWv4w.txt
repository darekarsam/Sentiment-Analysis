4	After watching the staff at Garlands i have to admit, flower arranging is a little bit of an Art form.The first thing you'll notice while walking past is the aroma, it literally stops you in your tracks and draws you in. There isn't a cleaner smell than freshly cut flowers (except maybe bleach or dulux paint).I don't know alot about flowers, but I do know how expensive they can be. For being in such a central location, the price for a good arrangement is very cheap. The staff also don't correct/ treat you like an idiot when you say things like "Gimmie a few of those pink ones".The arrangements aren't over the top and won't look out of place in your living room like some flowers do. To end on a down note, they also do a very tasteful collection of funeral flowers.
4	Garlands Florist is a beautiful little florist with excellent attention to detail. There's always a selection of potted plants dotted around outside the shop which makes it very welcoming and I'll always stop for a browse to see what catches my eye. The prices are very reasonable and you can pick up a ready made bunch of flowers or you can design your own bouquet.Whether it's a single bunch or a large supply of blooms for a wedding, even or special occasion, they can cater for you at Garlands.
