1	I wish we had a way to hold this corporation accountable for its crimes against our society.
1	Please go to the other McDonalds (not too far from here at 120 Penn Cir W).One time while using their drive-thru service, we realized they forgot to add an item on our receipt. We asked how much the real total is and the employee told me, "like $5.00." WHAT!?!!?!!  CAN YOU PLEASE USE YOUR REGISTER TO TELL ME HOW MUCH THE ACTUAL TOTAL IS!
3	Good for Altar bar. But they didn't have fries....
4	I don't understand the low reviews. This is a very well run neighborhood McDonald's where retired folks seem to gather over coffee in the morning. I have been here a few times and service was always prompt and courteous. The food is consistent with McDonald's everywhere and the restaurant clean.My only complaint was free ATT WiFi was slow on my last visit.
1	I don't expect much from fast food restaurants. But I do expect to be spoken to when I am a paying customer. I just went through the drive-thru at this location and, other than taking my order at the speaker, no one said a word to me. There was a different person at each window, and neither of them said hello, your total is, fuck you, nothing. I don't think I've ever encountered such a miserable bunch of people. Maybe they're upset because their heroin operation was shut down.
