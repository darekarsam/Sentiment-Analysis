5	Tried their foot reflexology and had a great time, perfect after a long day of standing. Great service and friendly people there. Will come back soon :D
5	This place is amazing. I was called nature's care. They went through a minor renovation and they offer a few more services. I went in for a 30 min foot detox and 45 min foot massage.  Joyce is amazing. She recognized me when I walked in and gave me a mini tour of the upgrades. She offers full body massages, facials(coming soon), and lymphatic massages now. Joyce had an appointment coming soon after I arrived so a lady named Ping gave me my massage. She was the nice lady. Just the right amount of pressure on my feet and calves( I've been working out alot lately). I asked her to massage me wrists once she concluded the foot massage. Not only was it no problem to accommodate my request, she gave both my arms a quick once over. I really appreciate it. It's time for a nap......lol. I've been to other foot massage places before and they don't compare to Essence Spa. I don't like how after the therapist is done, they always stalk you for a tip.  I'm not cheap by any stretch, but I only tip for quality service. Joyce and Ping certainly fit the bill.
5	Detox foot baths are awesome!   Clean, comfortable,  welcoming environment.  Will be a regular customer.
5	This is really a decent place. I was travelling with my boyfriend and got a couple's massage for only $100 and an facial for myself before we take off. ( which is their special package). The atmosphere is so relaxing, we fall in sleep like a baby.  Sophia is such a experienced and knowlegable esthetician. She made my face rejuvanated right away. They even do the most popular 3D permenant make up.  They offer so many services wish I had time to enjoy all. Will definetly come back.
