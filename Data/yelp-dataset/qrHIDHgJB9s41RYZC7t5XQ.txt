3	Decent pizza with large choice of calzone.
4	Quick delivery, really nice staff. Calzones are good. Pizzas are better (try the Calzone Special). Get the garlic bread. It's simple but delicious.
4	the food here is always fast and good
4	Great pizza. We ordered the meat lovers.. Service was a bit slow but I guess it does take enough time to cook a pizza. Tasted great though. Poutine was more of a 3 star on one.
5	I ordered from Calzones the other day and had a COMPLETELY different experience! I had a vege calzone again and it was amazing! Full of flavour and super fresh. My husband's chicken salad was pretty good too. Delivery is great, food is great! Can't wait to order again!
5	Excellent pizza and submarine! I highly recommend their Calzone Special pizza or Steak+ submarine, prepared on order with fresh ingredients.The place is very small and cafeteria-style, best to order or use their free delivery for groups. Perfect for quick lunch when you need your Italian fix.
