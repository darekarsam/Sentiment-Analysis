1	Worst service I have ever received at a Subway.
1	This is the worst Subway in Champaign-Urbana! Filthy, and the staff was bitching about the fact that he had to sweep the floor! I'll never be back, too many other options in town and close to this location. Ewwwwwwww!
2	This store is OK. It has been remodeled since the last reviewers and is clean and modern looking now. I tried the chipolte grilled chicken sandwich they have been advertising on the radio and it was bland. It was not spicy and I had pepper jack cheese on it. The chipolte sauce did not have any flavor at all. I could taste the bread over everything else. I do not recommend this sandwich unless you are looking for a bland, flavorless sandwich. I would like to add that the girls working the counter did a great job getting everyone through the line quickly. Sometimes when you go to Subways the people working the counter think your there just to stand and look at the ingredients under the glass.
1	This Subway is the closest to my work so I go here when I want a quick sandwich.  The last few times I have gone there have been big over sized work trucks parked in the parking lot.  The lot at this location is way too small and it's hard to maneuver around the vehicles.  I parked in the very last spot so no one would block me in and sure enough one of those over sized work trucks parked next to me in a no parking area.  I had to wait until he was done with his sandwich before I could leave.  I will avoid this Subway until they get this problem resolved.
