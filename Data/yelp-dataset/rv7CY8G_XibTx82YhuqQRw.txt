3	Are you are really looking at the review for LJS?  Its fried stuff, with extra fried stuff in a cardboard boat.  You will regret eating it 30 minutes after you finish, but it is delicious.
3	I agree with Paul on this one. But I had to stop here on my way home from work tonight. (I think I feel my heart yelling at me again) , The gal at the drive thru window was just soooo sweet , I just might go back and ask her to marry me! But then again , she gave me a slip with a survey on it to fill out online. Maybe she just wanted my positive response. Ok Sarah B. you got it ... now where's my free coke ?
5	It's deep fried garbage....it's LOS c'mon what do you expect.....however I have never had better, friendlier service at a fast food restaurant.
