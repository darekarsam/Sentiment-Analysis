5	I LOVE pizza and Joel's didn't let me down! Clean place, friendly staff, quick to get your food and the pizza was delicious. Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!
4	Hands down absolutely best *out of business* pizzeria in Charlotte! CLOSED FOR GOOD What a waste of time driving there (again) the store was stripped clean, fixtures, everything gone. So called "International drive" is a dead end side street off Providence, the only way to see it was to go looking for it, no wonder.  Then I tried grabbing a bite at the Kosher deli next door but they turned me down because it was too late (7:30?)
