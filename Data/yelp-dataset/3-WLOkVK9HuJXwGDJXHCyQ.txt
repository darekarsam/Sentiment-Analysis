1	Absolutely horrible! Greasiest Chinese food I've ever had. I have never seen vegetables covered in so much oil in my life! Food came out cold. Sign out front said $15.99 and they charged me $17.99 + tax. Do not go! You will regret it!
1	While on a weekend retreat in Montreal, we stopped in this buffet due to it's proximity to the Marriott Hotel. We should have reviewed it on YELP first but we took a chance, what can go wrong with Chinese buffet. Everything from food, location, service to damn near the water they served.  I wouldn't say they are worth a single star, but YELP wanted to be generous. We got the buffet but no food, the trays were less than half empty. We asked about paying for a buffet and  where was the food, we weren't seeing trays being refilled with food. Our waiter explained , that they are slow and the food would be coming soon, no such thing.  I would take the advise from the "Tom.B" who wrote the first review, don't go , terrible. Food wasn't great , service sucked and  they will rip you off!.
