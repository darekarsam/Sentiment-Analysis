4	Great little place. Grab a stick, sit with nice and friendly guest and smoke it up. Mike is very nice and well versed in cigars. When ever I'm in the area I make a point to stop in.

4	Shaving with razors and changing car tiresShooting with hand guns and building camp firesChanging old light bulbs and light fittingsThese are a few of those manlier things.Even to the tune of sound of music, there are few things in life more manly than smoking a good cigar.The building itself leaves something to be desired, and it's 'not quite' up to a Smoking Jackets required level, but the staff more than makes up for it. Cigar Inn is owned and operated by an extremely nice family of cigar aficionado's. Their daughter behind the counter will put most guys to shame with her mastery of tobacco, but without making you feel like less of a man when doing so. She asked me what I was looking for and I told her I'd like to have something not extremely bold, and easy to smoke. She suggested an Ashton (brand) cigar, which was perfect. I'll more than likely be back from time to time, I'm looking forward to my next visit!Happy Yelping Phoenix, go chop some wood, drink a single malt scotch, then come to Cigar Inn.
5	A great addition to the CRA family of Great American Cigar Shops. Mike and staff provide a relaxed, friendly, and comfortable place to enjoy a fine cigar.
