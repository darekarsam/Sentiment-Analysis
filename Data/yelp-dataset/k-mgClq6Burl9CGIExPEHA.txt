1	I waited in a long line and when finally at the checkout the clerk said my merchandise was mismarked and she was charging me what the computer said. I asked in three different ways for her to honor what the tag said and she just repeated what higher price she expected me to pay. I left my entire order at the checkout and will never go back. I buy a lot of clothes for my kids at Gap and this was my first time going to a Gap Outlet store.  This particular store lacked friendliness, customer service, and truth in advertising.  In retrospect I also feel a bit disgusted that their clearance items are actually more expensive than the 50% off of full price items, and felt the whole store was a low quality trinket-filled cluster.  My overall opinion of Gap in general is tainted.
2	I went looking for Christmas clothes for my niece and nephew but didn't like the selections.  The place was so cluttered and packed it made it difficult to movr around. The line was about 20 long with 5 registers open. I got nauseous and left with no purchase.
3	I had an average experience with this gap outlet. It opened at 10 AM and all the stores in the outlet were open by then but gap opened 3 min late. There was a crowd forming and the employees were just sitting inside. People were knocking on the doors and wondering why it wasn't open. It sounds really stupid but I think their employees should take their jobs seriously.   I was also a little annoyed because the dressing rooms were all locked and the employees had to unlock them which took a long time.   Overall my experience was average though. I loved how all the clothes were all folded and nothing was out of place. The employees were nice for the most part. I would recommend this gap again the location was convenient and the employees were nice. Hopefully they can make those minor changes and it will be better next time.
