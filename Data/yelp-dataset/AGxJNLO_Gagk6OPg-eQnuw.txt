5	It's Tiffany's. Nothing bad can happen to you there. Well you could possibly spend way too much money, but hey, who cares?
5	Everyone was super friendly, not too pushy and not overbearing. A very pleasant experience. It always tickles me to see the security guard at the door. Even the customers were super polite and friendly.
4	So my boyfriend & I stopped in here yesterday to look at engagement rings.While we were cheerfully greeted by the security man, the salesman we ended up with wasn't so friendly.  He seemed very uninterested in what we were there for.  He spoke so softly & mumbled what each ring was, we couldn't even understand what he was saying.  So unfortunately, based on this, I'm taking off a star.  All the other employees seemed very engaged & pleasant with their customers.  The store is huge & nicely laid out.  Jewelry is neatly displayed & signed.I've had Tiffany jewelry in the past & visited the store.  The brand & quality is phenomenal, not to mention recognizable.  Who doesn't know what that cute little blue box is with the white bow?  While it is somewhat grossly expensive, I think it's worth the price.Here's hoping my ring (Tiffany Legacy style) comes from here. :)
1	Buyer beware, worst return policy ever. Even with a receipt, they will not give you store credit after 30 days. Terrible customer service!
5	Great Customer Service Dept!  There is a new team member from Cincinnati / Ohio area so for us former TriState/Bengals folks, he will make you feel right at home!
