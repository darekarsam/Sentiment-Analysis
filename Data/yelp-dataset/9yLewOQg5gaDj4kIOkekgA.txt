3	Besides the distaste that comes with the name of this place, first impressions of Meatmarket were pretty positive - Funny roadside animal collages and colourful chairs made the place feel pretty cozy.A surly waitress showed up straight away with tasty tortilla chips and an olive tapenade that almost made us forget about her bad attitude. The menu she'd plopped down in front of us had a number of original and  appealing-sounding options like a duck-wing confit starter and a goat cheese and grilled zucchini-topped burger.We started with the flank steak poutine. The fries were little on the mushy side, and the steak much tougher than it could have been. The Asian garden salad with grilled tofu was the surprise success of this meal - Only slightly discerning that the vegetarian option at Meatmarket was better than the carnivorous one. The food overall was decent, but nothing to write home about. Meatmarket has some good stuff going for it, but doesn't quite get it all right.

I was not disappointed by my choice. They also have some great signature cocktails. I'd go back again during our visit next time.
