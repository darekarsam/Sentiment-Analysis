5	Drove by and saw the living Hotdog guy waving from the street.  It caught my attention and I decided to head in for lunch.You really get a genuine welcome when you first come in the door.  I was greeted and handed a menu.  Everyone had smiles on their faces and was glad to see a new customer.  All the equipment was clean along with the floors and tables.  I tried the chile dog and let me tell you something - WOW.  Very very very good.  The meat was delicious and just the right amount of everything you could ask for in a well made hotdog.  These are the moments you love being  a yelper!  You can share these treasure coves with others.  This is well worth the stop.
2	I love the dogs but I wont go back. I got yelled at by a crazy little cook who said I had made a mess the last 3 times I had been there. I had not been there but once before. I called and talked to owner and told him about it and he said he would take care of if.  I returned and got yelled at again by the little person. I will not return til the midget is gone. Owner is a nice buy but will be out of buisness like the last guy soon
1	Horrible people OK food. The food is soap but the owner needs a frontal lobotomy. By removing the little midget from his ass. Don't waste your time. Life is to short to go somewhere with no insurance on the Buisness.
5	Didn't expect it to be this good! Tried the foot long all beef with all the fixings, and it had to be the best tasting hot dog you can buy! Service was friendly! I am going to recommenend this to all my friends!
