2	Cart path is very bad with lots of ruts. Course has been in much better playing condition with previous ownership
4	I really like this course. It is short, cheap, quick, and fun. Not the best kept course but does the job
5	Great fun 9 hole course. They have a putting green, pitching area, and driving range. Maintenance takes care of it really well. Great for beginners to pratice. The service is excellent and the price is very reasonable.
