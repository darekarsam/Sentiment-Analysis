5	Wow what an awesome event!  Took the kids and headed over to Tryon for the parade.  Delighted to see so many participants and a huge crowd.There were bands and big name companies in the parade as well as churches and local groups.  My only complaint was that i didn't know my company was marching!  I wanted to join!!  So fun and a beautiful day.  Can't wait for next year!
5	I mean, what's not to love about this?  Charlotte is starting to show it's strength in diversity and this is a great way to keep the momentum going.  I took the family out to see it and although it's not the size of a St. Pat's or T-day parade it was pretty decent.The 5-stars doesn't really relate to the quality of the parade but more in line with the fact that the event was eye opening.  I hope to see bigger and better for years to come.
5	Celebrate diversity in Charlotte! This festival is growing each year & only getting better. There is a great vibe, most people are chill, & there's no rowdy behavior or disruptions. Highly recommend!
