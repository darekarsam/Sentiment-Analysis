1	Worst Hair cut ever from this location. I asked change for a 10 for tip and the other dresser was giving me all 1s. I told her to give me one 5 and five 1s and she got all sarcastic. b****!  what am i suppose to do with ten 1s? Next time ill pay the extra $10 to go to a real proffesional.
5	I recently went in and I loved the set up.  It was very clean and professional.  I love Jan, She's great and very respectful.  I even love her sense of humor.  She gave me great tips on my ends and to keep them kept well.  I ride a scooter, so my ends tend to get bad easily.
5	Eddie is awesome! He fixed my bad haircut that I got from another hair salon! My asymmetrical cut looks awesome now thanks to him! Before the cut he listened to how I wanted my cut and looked at a picture I showed him. During the cut, he would stop here and there and explain the process and make sure that it was what I wanted. So awesome! He was really funny and very social! I'm definitely coming back! Thanks Eddie!
