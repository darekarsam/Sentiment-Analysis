2	Convinent location, horrible customer service. My sandwich is either burnt or so sloppy it falls out. Sandwich preparers side conversations are loud. During peak hours not enough coverage for amount of people. Cashiers are usually somewhat happy to be there.
3	PROS: On the dark side of campus. one of the more healthier options. They have friendly staff and A clean atmosphere on the inside. there are also 2 places to order.CONS: even with all this, they are still really inefficient. The line can get way too long to wait in. there many times that they are under stocked with food items. And some of the items don't taste as fresh as others!sometimes customer service can get awkward lol, it's not very good.OVERALL: I always come here because it's closest to my classes, but they could use major improvements!
3	Subway! Market...fresh..every..day? Subway is a frequent go-to for me since it's close to my classes and research building, and the $5 foot longs are great for lunch and saving the other half for dinner. I would say this place is pretty standard, compared to others. The staff are usually nice and have gotten my back when I forgot my wallet, or when they just wanna give free cookies (yayy! Shout out to less-young Filipino lady working). The line at this location can be backed up like crazy though, so I try to avoid it as much as possible when 10a classes get out and especially when 1130a classes get out (ay caramba, foreal). Unfortunately, summer hours are limited here and this location is only open during session 3 until 2p. I appreciate they have regular iced tea options too! Makes staving off from soda a lot easier.
4	Yes it is on campus a huge plus. It is Subway and if you need food (and convenience) this is the shop to stop at. Service is fine, it's a sandwich not rocket science, it's not that bad. Store is clean, kinda small, but come on it is a kiosk shop. Grilled chicken on flatbread.. yumm..yumm..yumm
