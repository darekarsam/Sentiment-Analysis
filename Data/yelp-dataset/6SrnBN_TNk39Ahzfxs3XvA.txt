4	Online check in makes the whole hair cut process a lot easier. I gave this a 4 star because I liked my haircut and the check in.
2	service and quality are unreliable: one of the best haircuts I've ever had, but mostly mediocre and sometimes really awful service
2	This great clips is not crowded. But not the best when compared to 34th ave and some others nearby. Went in once and they started cutting my hair..No question on what you want to do or what clipper you use & I was first time there
4	We went over here to get some back to school hair cuts done for the kids and had a great experience. Normally my kids move around a fuss the entire time, but the two ladies that cut their hair did a great job. They kept them calm and relaxed, which is amazing in itself, but also did a fantastic job on their hair.My oldest told me as we were leaving that he wanted his hair cut exactly the same way next time. That is a big deal in my house because he is not a big fan of getting his hair cut. Good service, good people, good hair cuts, and good prices. It does get crowded when they first open up, but you can reserve a time on line to avoid a long wait.
