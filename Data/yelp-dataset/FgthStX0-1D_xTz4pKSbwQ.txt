1	I had a horrible experience with VIP as my property management company. They charged me $85 in labor only to replace a ceiling fan. Similar exhorbinant labor charges were also charged for other repairs. VIP also left bills unpaid, to the point of shut-off and I was unable to obtain an ending month roll for over a month of requesting it numerous times.
1	I too had a horrible experience with Valley Income Properties. They managed our apartment building for a year. In that year, security deposits decreased over 50%, rents decreased, laundry income decreased, lease terms went from 1 year to 6 months and late fees for overdue rent were very rarely collected. As the owner, I had to take over lease extensions because the property manager couldn't get it done. When I asked Rich (the VIP manager who handled our building) via email about my concerns regarding decreased security deposits, expired leases, late fees, etc, his brother Jeff (the owner of VIP) replied and told me I needed to stop micro managing. As the owner of VIP, Jeff should have picked up the phone and talked with me about my concerns instead of being defensive and confrontational about his brother. While he monitored Rich's email, he did not monitor his text or our face to face meetings when Rich told me he managed 24 other properties and was overwhelmed. VIP lacks professionalism and people skills. I would not recommend them at all. The good news is the new property management is professional and competent.
5	This is one of the most professional companies I have lived with.They care about their tenants and any issues they have.The onsite manager does little events just to show appreciation for their tenants.I am very happy living with this management company!
