4	Tuesdays they have live music on the patio. Excellent Happy Hour prices. Always a fun time.  Fill out a comment card and get a pint for a $1
2	As regulars we usually go Tuesday nights on the Patio for live music.  Last night was terrible. In all my years in Vegas I have never heard a band as bad as last night. They sang outta tune, outta key. We're extremely loud and basically just sucked. Our server was either from Italy or Latino. My wife said Brazil???   she couldn't understand English. We asked what wines they poured after repeating the question a few times she thought about it and said we have Red and White.  Really!!!I asked for crushed red chili flakes for my flat bread and she didn't have a clue.  I asked for a Gin and Tonic and got Gin and Soda.   I guess it was a night we all should of stayed home.
5	I was invited to this cute spot by one of my myoho sisters. It is a PERFECT spot for lunch. The menu is simple but full of variety. I had the steak nachos with guacamole (I used the 50% off any starter coupon offered for first timers--super generous savings!) and peach green tea. The nachos were HUGE and the tea was perfect; ice cold and with just the right amount of sweet.The best part about this spot is the view! The patio is the place to be. See attached photo. For golf course food it rates the best for taste and value for your money. The nachos start at $10 - but for the price you get what you pay for. The manager came out to thank me for using Yelp! It made me feel pretty good and my girlfriend was impressed. The waitress was prompt and friendly. I will be sharing for this spot with other girlfriends. It's perfect for socializing.
5	After a round in the cold we decided to stay and watch the dallas game and have lunch and drinks.  Great food and service.  The mahi was moist and cooked perfectly and the sweet potato fries were great.  Would definitely put this restaurant with great views on my list of places to eat.
