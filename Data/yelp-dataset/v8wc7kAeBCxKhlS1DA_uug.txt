3	Cafe Camino is part of St Mary's Cathedral, where I once went to a party and drank copious amounts of Martini, and then came to the decision that this would not be my life partnered drink of choice. I'm still working on that one, but meanwhile, I'll tell you about the cafe, which I actually only noticed recently for some reason. There is lots of seating here, and a lot of lunchtime food choices, so lunch hours here are very busy, because it's also all very reasonably priced. The soup I had here was yummy, and so were the Jaffa Cakes, but I suppose that's irrelevant, as was my nostalgia at the beginning of this review. There are also amazing cakes, bonus, and free Wi-Fi, even larger bonus. If you're a nosey parker people watcher, you can nose away to your peeping eyes' delight here, as this is a busy part of town with lots of wandering individuals.

Cafe Camino is a lovely place to stop by for whatever reason.  When you're in the cafe you forget it has any affiliation to the church at all and they certainly don't push anything down your throat so please don't be put off.  Whether you want an 11's snack, lunch or an afternoon coffee then this place is a good shout.  They do good coffees without them being the price of Starbucks so it is a clear winner.  The soup is always a good option and you get a good, hearty bowl of homemade goodness.  The cakes are divine and the smoothies are a particular favourite of mine as they have lots of combinations available.  Nice place to sit and unwind.
