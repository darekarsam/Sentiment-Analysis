4	What a treasure, right on the edge of town. My daughter went to camp there and they engaged the kids in lots of fun activities. The snacks weren't the healthiest, but the staff were knowledgeable and good with kids.  We also went to their fall festival and my kids had a blast. The activities are fun, yet educational.The nature preserve is open and free for all.
4	My son went there on a class field trip. Friendly and passionate staff. Great place to learn about nature and for "planting the seed" of protecting/respecting the environment.
5	I visited the Aldo LeopoId Nature Center in Monona, WI yesterday, 09-06-14. What a joyful experience. It wasn't just the exposure of communing with nature, which was an unbelievable surprise, but  I ended up spending hours both inside and out learning about its richness and beauty, not to mention discovering all the educational opportunities. If you're from the greater Madison area or perhaps just visiting - this is a 5-star experience in my book. And if you have kids or grand-kids - be sure to bring them along. They will LOVE it.
5	Phenomenal experience for the whole family! It's amazing because you're right in the midst of an urban setting but the prairie is native and the setting is stunning. My daughter loved seeing the turtles floating on logs and the rabbits hopping along the trails. We became a member on our first visit. It's a great organization to support.
