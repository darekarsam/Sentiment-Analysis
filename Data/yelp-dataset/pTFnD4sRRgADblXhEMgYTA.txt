5	For the uninitiated alien rock 2 (or alien 2) is a bouldering centre. The theory behind bouldering is it allows you to practise various technical challenges of climbing without having to be outdoors or 60ft up a face!Alien 2 has routes graded from 0 to 8, which differs ever so slightly from the vb to v8 system out at Eica:ratho. There is a lovely big tutorial board by the entrance that explains the colouring system and the difficulty charts at the dot of each line (there are 40 lines in total.) and handily identify the pink spot routes as a good starting place for beginners. I can confirm that these are a good place to start if you are anything other than an experienced climber!The routes challenge your strength, flexibility, and technical climbing ability. The atmosphere is mixed. Energetic tunes blast out of the stereo (quality tunes to my highly refined pretentious taste!) make for a lively feel but it's lacking in conversation. That said we were identified as newbies and given a little chat by some there. Chiefly it is a nice temperature here, I was climbing happily in shorts and t shirt. A welcome change from the outdoor temperatures of ratho. The place is a little tucked away amongst various industrial warehouses (after you've climbed pop next door to buy nailguns?) and can be a tad unobvious if you don't know it's there so I'd suggest a little google mapping before you head down there. I haven't been to alien rock 1 yet so I can't make any comparison to the bouldering there. There's more routes available than there is at ratho, although ratho feels a little more suited to beginners to my mind.
