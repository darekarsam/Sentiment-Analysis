1	First of all, don't go on the weekend... you get the old bags and the groups of underaged kids with fake id's. No ambiience! The dj Christopher will favor his friends or just put the requests in any random order. We waited one hour and a half to sing one song and the place was hardly full!, I saw people just arriving and would be called to sing within the next 10 minutes, gimme a f...break! The place used to rock. What!s happening? We had visitors from out of town. What a shame!
5	This place is pretty ridiculous, really.  Like the famous Mint in San Fran, it's set up perfectly as a karaoke bar (with good sound, a proper stage, and a respectable dance floor, as all K-bars should have), yet for some inexplicable reason it incongruously doubles as a white-tablecloth fondue restaurant!  I really can't imagine coming here to eat, but I'll definitely be back to sing the next time I'm in the city...
3	Went here with a few friends to see what this place was really about. Food was pretty good. Space is really small though and there were a few times where I imagined the fondue pots being dropped on patrons. I got wasted and broke a wine glass, whoops. They should really rethink the white table cloths and thin wine glasses. Our server was great, very kind and attentive. We dropped about $600 for about 5 people. As for the karaoke DJ, it was a woman who was uber French. She seemed to allow the same people sing all of the time and maybe it was just me being an English snob but I found she catered to the French patrons, whatevs. Could have just been me. We didn't get to sign as much as we would have liked. Overall experience was fun, I think I'd go back, maybe.
