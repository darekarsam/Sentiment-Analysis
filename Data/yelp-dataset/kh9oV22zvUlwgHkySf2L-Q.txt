3	This is my neighborhood gas station.The gas is always cheaper than the other stores in the area, the staff is usually pretty friendly, the store is always clean, and they are fairly competitive with prices inside the store as well.The have a great selection of drinks and food including a Fountian Drinks and their "grill". As a bonus they have a fixin's bar where you can add toppings to your sandwiches, nachos, etc.They also have an attached car wash that you can get a discount at if you buy gas and a car wash at the same time.My only major gripe is that they charge a fee to use your debit card, however if you run a debit card as credit, they don't charge anything
5	Absolute best car wash in the area and always a friendly staff in both the car wash and the store.  The store itself is always clean and well stocked.
3	Never had a problem with the gasoline here, and it's cheaper in price than Smith's or other places in the immediate vicinity. I like the car wash fair enough, and there are vacuum cleaners available with car wash purchase. The store is always very busy but the cashiers were efficient and polite. The store seems to be clean enough. Far too often there are panhandlers scamming people, but there isn't much the property can do about it except tell the panhandlers to leave.
