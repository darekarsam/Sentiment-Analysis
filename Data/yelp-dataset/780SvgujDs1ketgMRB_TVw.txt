4	I can't comment on the laundromat side of things since I've never used them, but as far as a cafe goes, I really enjoy coming by this place. The food is good, and I've actually had some nice conversations with the staff, never felt cold. They recently started doing pizzas which are pretty delicious (choose your own toppings, cheeze, and meat) and I love the woody environment and terrace. Only knock I have is that service can be very slow when busy, they seem a little understaffed at times.
