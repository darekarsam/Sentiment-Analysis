3	A little scruffy and rough round the edges, yet housing a range of camera accessories, Castle Photographic offers plenty for the photography fanatic.As with most independent shops the owner is enthusiastic and willing to advise you on the best product: knowing little about camera equipment I was kindly enlightened about the possible modification for my current camera by the helpful owner.There's a range of prints of the Edinburgh Castle, Falkirk wheel and more available too, just in case your granny wants a souvenir.Worth a peak.
4	For ages I thought Castle Photographic was just a lame tourist shop. Because it's right next to the Castle. Ish. The name says all. Anyway, it's not. You know how some women go mad over shoes? Well, I've got that about cameras, which can be a lot more expensive as an obsession, but that depends on what kind of shoes you're buying. And on if you know how to develop your own photos. Castle Photographic has a beautiful display of old and new cameras. I go all tingly when I see them. And then turn away and resist buying them. For the sake of my next meal. Castle Photographic used to be THE place to get polaroid film (sadly, very sadly discontinued). Cheapest in the city. Now you can still get your range of 120 film, which as far as I'm concerned, is not the easiest film to find. They stock your usual Kodak and Ilford in both formats. And you can get your film developed there, though they send it off to a lab. The man who works there is absolutely lovely and extremely helpful. Definitely pop in if you're a photo geek. And even if you're not.
1	This place is closed, as in no longer in operation.My husband and I went 'round to this shop on Friday (09 November 2012) to see if the owner could tell me what was wrong with my camera (Nikon D40). I was quite disappointed to see that it was shut and the owner retired. Problem ended up being a worn out lens (replaced at Curry's over on Princes Street), so it was all ok in the end.
