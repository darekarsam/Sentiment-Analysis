3	The service is excellent...and the food is pretty yummy as well!  It is my little treat when I am having a bad day :)
2	how disappointing!  the Qdobas in NYC are pretty good - they have to compete with Chipotle after all, who i think puts crack in their food because it's so addictive.  here though, after multiple tries, i just got mediocre bland food in many forms.  too bad because i know it can be good.
4	Love this location.The food is iffy, but the staff is great.
5	I eat here several times a week.  The food and service is fantastic.  The only downside is waiting in line for lunch, which can be quite long on some days with very little room.  No matter how busy, the staff is always friendly and the food is always high quality.
3	Solid burrito, taco, quesadilla joint.  I generally put Chipotle above Qdoba, but the food and service at this location is quite good.  At $5 per, burritos on Fridays are a nice value (though I've taken to adding extra chicken for a bit more $).My one gripe is that they don't put enough meat in their tacos.  However, that seems to be a Qdoba-wide issue and not specific to this location.
