4	A hidden gem on the South side of Edinburgh. Part of me hates to give it away in fact but this is a superb supermarket for all your Asian food needs.I am never without a packet of their dim sum in my freezer and I always end up finding a new ingredient to try out. They have a monstrous selection of noodles, every Asian sauce or spice you could ever want, heaps of frozen dim dum and some weird but wonderful delicacies for the adventurous.
