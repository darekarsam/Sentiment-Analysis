4	I haven't taken classes here, but my experience started when I was a kid and my dad took me to a concert about the history of music with a drum solo that blew my mind. The love affair kicked off there. I love the old buildings from the 60s and 70s that remind me of the ideals of those times, the big open spaces with raw concrete halfway sunk into the earth and lifting up through several floors of windows looking out on old churches covered these days in projection mapping and often lots of snow. The teachers and students I've met here have all been cool and civic minded and open minded and engaged. The newer buildings are labyrinthine like a good university should be with lots of light and a (possibly intentional) lack of internet access inside the classrooms.
