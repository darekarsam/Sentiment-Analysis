4	Boston Markets are the same anywhere, but the people who work here are great. This is my favorite one!
4	If ever there was a fast food place that I could say that I love, it would be Boston Market.  You go in, you order at the counter, you pay, you get your food and then take it to your seat just like every other fast food joint.  But here, you have fresh roasted chicken -- MMM.  Today was an off day, though, and they had sold out of the chicken.  The associates said they had an untimely barrage of customers and that it would be ten more minutes before the next batch of chicken was ready,  not wanting to wait I opted to try one of their newer sandwiches and ordered:Brisket and Swiss dip (au jus)Mac n cheeseMashed Potatoes and brown gravyI love Boston Market's Mac n' cheese.  The noodles are spiral and always al dente -- today was no different. The mashed potatoes and gravy -- while obviously not homemade -- are always good with a little pepper.  I must say, though, that my chicken stand-in was also very good.  Not up to the fresh chicken standards; but good none-the-less.  The meat was moist and the au jus was flavorful.  I wish the bread was not as dry, but I had au jus so there was balance.When needing food on the run, I will always go to Boston Market if given the choice.
3	I prefer supporting our small business people , but sometimes convenience overrides desire.The Food here is not bad , portion size and price all seem ok , but the woman that served us was not very friendly.  No Thank you ,,,or have a nice day ,,,, just a grunt ? She did not close the plastic lid on my meal and the gravy spilled inside the bag , leaking on the car seat. She also forgot to include my cornbread. This place would do well to hire people who enjoy working with the public.
