1	Consistantly an hour and a half to two hour delivery time. THAT'S ABSURD. Service is slow and rude. Pretty much all of the staff acts as though they are doing you a favor. Pizza Hut Co. Really needs to make some changes to this location. It just plain sucks.
1	If you want pizza.. go somewhere else unless you pick it up in the store or you are completely okay with waiting for 2 hours to be delivered.  There hasn't been a single time when I have ordered from here that I have got it in a reasonable amount of time.  I have actually waited about two hours before calling in which they informed me that it hasn't even left yet.  They were completely rude and told me that if I wanted it quickly I could drive to come get it.  I could go on and on but seriously, just go elsewhere.
1	Called at  7pm, they are open till 11pm, I was told they are not delivering, I live a 20 minute walk away from this store, the weather is clear, i called the last 2 days and the same thing at different times, They have a track record of closing early, and not delivering past 8 pm, back when i ordered more regulry, i don't recommend this place unless you are desperate!
1	Avoid this place at all cost.  Probably the worst customer service I've experienced in my entire life.
