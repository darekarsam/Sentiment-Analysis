5	These guys are a great outfit! I came here looking for a road bike for my triathlon training. Not knowing anything about riding really, Ricky and Abraham answered all my questions, got me set up with the right gear and got me on an amazing bike! Highly recommended!
5	Their inventory is second to none. I called around 30 bike shops looking for a specific part that has been discontinued by the manufacturer and they actually had it in stock. Most places told me it was only available through special order. They even packed up the item for me and had it ready for a friend that went to pick it up. Great service.
5	We're from Lexington, MA.  We were in town for a conference and walking around Scottsdale.  My wife and I are bikers, so when I saw the shop, I had to stop in.  Turns out that they were throwing a bbq for their customers as a thank you celebration for their 10th year in business and 2nd year at that location.  Notwithstanding the fact that we were out of towners, they insisted that we have some lunch (excellent bbq, beer, and cookies!).  Shasta, in particular, was very very nice.  We picked up a couple of T-shirts because we liked the shop and the name.  Then when we were checking out, the guy at the register figured out that we were from Lexington -- lo and behold, his father (who happened to be in the shop at the time) was also from Lexington.  We had a very pleasant chat with the two of them too.  Bottom line, even though we cannot be regulars there, the folks at Bike Haus treated us as if we were long time customers.  That's what I love about good local bike shops.  As an aside, they have really nice kits and bikes there.  Some of it aspirational for me.  Support your LBS folks.
