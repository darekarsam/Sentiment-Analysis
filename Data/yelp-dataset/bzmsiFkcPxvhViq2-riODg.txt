5	To come
5	Great Italian Ristorante, mussel all you can eat with fries , gnocchi rose or Gorgonzola , pasta Alfredo ' chicken  ossobuco amazing , like mamma use to make, Eduado made our evening great in doors & terrace , will be back Grazie.
4	It was just okay. Typical hotel food but our server gave us very good  service. We  had  the  lasagna  and  all you  can  eat muscles.  The  muscles lacked  the  flavour  and  you  could only  have  one choice of sauce.  The lasagna  was runny but  the noodles  were perfectly prepared.
