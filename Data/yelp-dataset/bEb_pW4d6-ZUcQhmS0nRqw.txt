5	Best dentist I've ever been to...first time ever I haven't felt any pain while at dentist.  No, you don't understand...I DIDN'T EVEN FEEL SHOT THEY USED TO NUMB ME!  No pain whatsoever!!!  It was also very quick!  I got 2 cavities filled in 45 minutes plus he saved me from having to get a root canal!  I am so grateful I found him!
5	I travel nearly an hour to get my dental services completed by the dental office of Brian McMurtry and staff. They always do a great job!
5	I traveled over 3 hours to have my son's tongue revised by Dr. McMurtry because he was so highly recommended. He was out of network for us, which cost us out of pocket, until insurance could be filed and then partially reimbursed, but it was all worth it.  From start to finish I could not be any more pleased with Dr. McMurtry and his entire staff.  They are amazing!!  My 4 year old son was comfortable around him and the staff. They made him feel right at home, from laughing with him, to trying to find his favorite TV shows.  He ended up having to get several shots to numb his tongue for the laser procedure and to this day he will tell you he did NOT have to get the shot, bc he didn't even feel it.  Dr. McMurtry is amazing with children.  If I lived anywhere close to Charlotte he would be my entire family's dentist.  I HIGHLY recommend him!
