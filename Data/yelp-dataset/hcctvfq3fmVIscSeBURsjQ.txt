3	It's not like the other Getgo's.  If you are expecting to be able to get a soda or something freshly made, don't come this way.This location used to be the Sunoco with a garage, that being the reason why you don't want to waste the time.  For as tiny as the lot is that this is located on, there are eight pumps  gas.  They do sale small items such as gum, cigarettes and chewing tobacco.  Lottery service also available.
1	Enormous disappointment. The employees are rude and won't stop talking to each other long enough to acknowledge you at the glass window. And, about that window.....where are the welcoming double doors that invite you in to buy soda and chips when you have the munchies, or a loaf of bread if you are in need and it's too late to go to the regular giant eagle? I was SO looking forward to a proper GetGo opening in this part of RS. I just don't like going there ever.One good thing though- the fella next door who who owns the convenience store doesn't have to worry about loosing any customers and it better to root for the little guy vs. big corporate places anyway.
2	This place is such a waste of space. Sure I like being able to use/get my GE points, but they really ought to open up a real store and skip their weird walk-up window thing. The window is tinted in such a way that you can't see inside, you can barely even see if there's a clerk there to wait on you. Even though the speakers are brand new you can barely understand the person talking to you.I wish they would have just bulldozed the place, paved it, and made it a public parking lot. THAT'S what we really needed in Regent Square.
