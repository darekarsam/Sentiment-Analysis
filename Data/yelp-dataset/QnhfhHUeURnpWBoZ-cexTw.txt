1	I would not go back to this McDonalds if my life depended on it! -smelly tables and floors -slow service and with an attitude -cold friers (the only thing I ordered) -for some reason it's packed! Maybe this is Vegas? I would rather pay a few more dollars and get a decent meal.
5	This is a great McDonalds location! Located on the Las Vegas Strip, I love it. There's usually a big line, however they work very hard to make your ordering process fast and easy. Although it's very busy, the tables are clean, and there are always tables available. Also, the bathroom was very clean.I rarely give a 5 Star Review... However, I feel this location deserves it. Many business' raise prices, because they are in a tourist location. This McDonalds has a full menu, @ normal McDonald's Prices! I would definitely recommend this location to friends and family. When on the strip, I suggest having a meal here.
