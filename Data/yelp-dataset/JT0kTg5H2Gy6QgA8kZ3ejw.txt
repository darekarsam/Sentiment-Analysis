1	Really bad experience here, still not addressed. Either the company has a policy if adding expensive, unwanted, extras or they encourage their salespeople to do it while they turn their head. Have spoke with General Mgr and corporate. They're NOT denying it but, so far, nothing. Next up, area supervisor, regional director, tv stations that advocate for consumer. Guys, I'm not buying a used car, just some eyeglasses.7/29. Received a call this morning from one of the best local consumer reporters promising a looksie and some mystery shopping of this chain. Only problem, they are 2-4 months out. I can wait.  In the meantime, I am working on getting a commission schedule. If you can help with that, please let me know. Ty.
