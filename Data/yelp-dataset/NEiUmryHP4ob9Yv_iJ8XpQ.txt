4	Just stopped to get some bloodwork done, the office was clean, the employee's were nice and very helpful. Bonus was I didn't have to wait long.
1	Rotten place to go.My PCP's office is literally 2 doors down from this place.  I walked in at 3:52pm and gave them the card my PCP told me to give to them.  They told me to have a seat and it would take a while to get my paperwork.  6 mins later, (3:58pm) they inform me they still haven't received my paperwork and encouraged me to go back to my PCP's office to get the paperwork faster.I literally ran to the other office, request for the paperwork and ran back within 2 mins.  They locked the doors.  They failed to tell me that they closed at 4pm.Why tell me to go back to my PCP's office if they are just going to lock the doors behind me?  Why not tell me up front that by the time I get my paperwork they will be closed?The thing that bothers me the most is that another patient was inside the office and couldn't get anything done until 4pm...something about her body knowing that it was 4pm.  While I was at the front desk, signing in, she wanted to be seen at that time and they were short with her, telling her she HAD to wait until 4pm. It wasn't like they were leaving at 4pm anyway...another patient supposedly HAD to wait until 4pm until she could be seen.Lazy, deceptive office with no morals.
4	Went here on one of my "off" Fridays for bloodwork.  This is actually pretty good.  Perhaps because the place appears to be relatively newer, and because they do not run on weekends, it is less busy.  It is a good location.
