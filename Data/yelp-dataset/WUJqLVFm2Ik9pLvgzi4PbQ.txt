5	5 stars for the phenomenal staff (every single one of them), the amazing selection of children's clothes, and Stella's impressive ethical designs! I came in here in June 2011 to pick up an item for my friend's 1 year-old, and was floored by the staff's approachability, helpfulness, and genuine friendliness.  My friends and I ended up spending over half an hour in here just browsing, and talking and laughing with the sales staff.  I purchased a children's sweater, which they beautifully gift-wrapped.  By far the best shopping experience I have had in Las Vegas to date!!!!
1	The store is lovely, sadly the sales associates are not.  This store is located in Crystals Shopping Center which has only high end stores.  There wasn't a single other store that was as snooty as this one.  Not Fun.
5	Stopped in this store to browse with my mom;  the sales lady couldn't have been nicer and made us feel very welcome! :)  Didn't buy anything yet, but the purse is still on my mind.
