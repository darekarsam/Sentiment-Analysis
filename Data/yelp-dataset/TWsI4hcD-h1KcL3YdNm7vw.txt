5	I have been a business customer when they were still Alltel. Josh and the whole staff have always taken care of me at this location.
5	Great service
1	I have been a Verizon customer for many years and this is the worst service I have ever received.  I expect the prices to be higher in a Verizon corporate store than Costco, Best Buy, etc (which they are).  However, I also expect the quality of the service and the knowledge of the products to be higher as well (which it is not).
2	best luck to wait in line for a guy behind the desk.  The other two sales associates were too busy posing as customers in an empty store to acknowledge the one customer, me, that was there.  This is a real change from some other verizon stores where somebody greets you, gives you a number, and the associates talk to customers and want you to buy their products.  Weird vibe in this store.
5	This location is now permanently closed.
