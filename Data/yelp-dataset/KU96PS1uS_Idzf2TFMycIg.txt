3	Nice enough dry cleaner. Took a jacket here and was quoted $12 but when I picked it up, it was only $7. Win? Perhaps!
4	Great service and prices!
5	Super friendly service, seriously everyone is so nice that works there.  Great dry cleaning, plus they offer same day service. Conveniently located right off off Scott Avenue - they are on the corner next to Carolina Smoothies.
