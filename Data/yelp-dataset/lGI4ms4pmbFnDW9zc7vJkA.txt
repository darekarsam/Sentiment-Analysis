2	EH, I'd rather go to sheetz

3	This is just an oddly configured GetGo.  It's hard to come in here and get right to a pump.  There is so much traffic on 51 that everyone has the same idea.  That idea being I'll just pull in real quick and get my gas.  Let me tell you people, that doesn't happen here.Exiting is just as not fun here.  I chose to go to the light instead of pulling out onto 51 again.  It's just so much easier than praying that you'll make out of there alive.
