5	Great mexican food!
3	Stopped by for a take out order. The food was great but the wait was a little long seeing I was the only customer in the place.
5	Amazing food from start to finish! I wanted some good authentic Mexican food so I drive 45 minutes and it was worth it! The food was fresh to order with amazing salsa and the service was great! We got our food within great timing.  I would definitely come back!
