5	Excellent service, friendly staff and delicious food . I came down to Charlotte from NY to visit family and stopped by to try thier famous enchiladas. Highly recommended trying their horcarta as well. Next time I'm in town I'm definitely coming back.
5	This is the best Mexican food, the most authentic Mexican food, I've ever had in my life.  We were in the neighborhood and had heard about this place.  It doesn't look like much.  We were the only people there that were white, and nearly all the customers appeared to be Latino, which I assumed was positive.  This place used to be called Cocina Latina and was listed in the Our State Magazine 100 places in 100 counties.  They still had the recommended food item, the enchiladas verdes con pollo on the menu.  It was fantastic.  The tortillas were clearly made from scratch and the homemade green sauce was spectacular and spicy.  We also had some homemade guacamole and an assortment of salsas that were brought to the table.  I'm still not sure what some of these salsas were, but they were all awesome.I really enjoyed my experience.  This isn't gringo mexican, this is authentic.  Go for it!
