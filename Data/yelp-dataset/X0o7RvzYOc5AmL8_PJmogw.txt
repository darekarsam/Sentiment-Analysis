2	Are all the UPS Stores the same?  If so they all charge $39.37 to pack and ship a boxed item to Arkansas.  $15.45 for ground freight and $23.92 (with tax) to box it!  The toy in a box I brought in was about 28"x10"x4" and weighed about 8 lbs.  They told me the box the toy came in needed an outer shipping box.  The clerk said that would be $21.95.  I thought total.  Wrong!  That's on top of shipping!  For a cardboard box!  It was declared over sized- thus the premium.  The lesson is to seek out a shipping box before arriving at a UPS store.

1	Shipped an iPad mini... Never got scanned out by USPS and never reached its destination. All I got as an answer was "they aren't required to scan, how do you know it never made it.." Umm why did I pay you for signature confirmation?
