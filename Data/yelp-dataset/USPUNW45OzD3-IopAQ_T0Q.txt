5	Decided to try this shop out because its owned and operated by a veteran of our US Army, I was not disappointed...excellent customer service and prices...I am glad I found this shop!
5	Great place!! Love the service! Didn't feel haggled to get more than I really needed. Didn't feel overcharged. Carl is very friendly and I wouldn't take my car anywhere else.
5	Wow! I am so impressed with the professionalism and personal care that I received here. From the very beginning I knew I was in good hands and was not being overcharged or pressured into a thing. If you are looking for personal one-on-one care for your vehicle this is the place.
5	Took my truck in for a leak that another shop spotted during the last oil change.  Carl got me in quick and is a straight shooter.  Turned out there wasn't really a leak.  He had me in and out in less than 30 minutes.  Another shop may not have been as honest.  I would highly recommend this shop, owned and operated by a vet!
