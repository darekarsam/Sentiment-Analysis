4	Trust.  It's something rarely discussed when referring to auto repair.  I like to consider myself a "man's man", but my knowledge of cars and what makes them go vroom is limited at best.  For this reason, every one needs to have a mechanic they can trust to "do the right thing".  I've been burnt more times than I care to admit, sometimes lied straight to my face - this can turn a man against an entire industry.  A good friend recommended this place, and even though it's out of the way, and it's a little run down, it's refreshing to know you can bring a problem to them and get the truth.  Thanks fellas for doing the right thing, I will refer all my local friends to you!  Keep it up.
5	When we moved back to AZ 2 years ago I was SO happy that Hefner's would once again be my mechanic.  My family has been going to them for over 30 years now and we refer them to everyone!  I just picked up my car today and thought how lucky I am that I can get my car repaired (never fun) and walk away with a smile.  I needed an expensive repair and Hefner's called around to find the best deal for me.  I am always happily surprised when I go to pay my bill because it is always around what they quoted me and oftentimes under.  I find myself saying "hope to see you soon!" and having to clarify that...but I really do love these guys that much!

They are thorough in their diagnostics and they call you during repairs anytime something changes in their original diagnosis or estimated costs. Another great thing that they do is to give you options on whether you make all the recommended repairs now or save some for later...because sometimes it's nice to swallow an elephant a little bit at a time. Great guys, doing great work, at great prices.
