2	I have been here a couple of times now, and it's...okay. The first time I went, I had a burger and fries and they were so-so. Nothing special, but good enough. The second time I went, just this past week, I only had a couple of beers. I will say that their beer selection is...bad. Rickards, Molson, and a few others. Very uninspired and mediocre. Also, the service has always been friendly enough, but very slow. Whether it's busy or empty, I have experienced painfully slow service on both fronts. And the interesting  part - the bathrooms are all upstairs, so it can be a bit of a hike. And I imagine it's really a pain for anyone with mobility issues, seeing as they would have to take an elevator I assume (where it is, I have no idea).
4	Late Sunday night two hungry guys after a full travel day. All the venues near our hotel are either closed or closing. Off in the distance Cage aux Sports beckons. Yes they are open and the kitchen is open! Big screen TVs all around to watch the Pens Rangers game. We sat at the bar and received excellent service.Food was better than average (good) and the diverse draft beer selection was well appreciated. Our bartender was more than helpful with our menu questions and made sure we were never thirsty!Great sports bar!
2	Let me start by saying that if I wasn't staying at a hotel within walking distance I would have never been back. The ONLY thing that did bring me back was the Rickard's Dark beer on tap.Food......2 starsBlonde girl on Thursday that paid more attention to her boyfriend sitting at the end of the bar than the paying customers...............1 starAnna......5 starsSave your money and your time and go somewhere else!
