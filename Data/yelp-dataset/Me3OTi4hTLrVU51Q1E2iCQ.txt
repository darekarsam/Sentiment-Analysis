3	I sometimes end up going here when I can't bare the thought of having to walk under the tunnel to St-Jacques so I can shop at Loblaws. This Provigo has a decent selection of produce and they usually stock the products featured in weekly flyer.Sometimes, the produce here is terrible. Like today. The first 5 tomatoes I grabbed were rotten. The basket Moroccan clementines didn't look very nice either, just a peak revealed at least 4 were moldy, meaning, I didn't even want to dig further in. However, most of the other fruits and vegetables looked good. It one of those things, you really have to check for freshness.I have never had a problem with the meats or fish here, though they do have a very limited selection of meats, and the fish counter is scarce in terms of variety. If I am buying meat here, it is usually something on sale that I caught in the flyer.In the aisles, you can find a large selection of PC products, in some cases, there are only one or two other brands and an entire selection of PC. For example, I was looking at coffee, ground coffee, and wanted to do something different. Their were plenty of choices but I could easily guesstimate that 50% of the coffee area were PC products.The frozen section is a repeat of the coffee section. Lot's of PC products from "Sirloin Burgers", to "Stampede ribs", to a whole line of hors d'oeuvres, all PC branded, blue box and regular.I went here this morning hoping to find the new PC branded Rock'n'Peach Bliss Cheesecake from the Recipe to Riches TV show. Found!

4	Great place, lots of parking. Lots of choices for fruits and veggies. They have a nice veggy/vegan section.The prices are a little cheaper than the downtown provigo, which is great.They also have a student discount on certain days!
