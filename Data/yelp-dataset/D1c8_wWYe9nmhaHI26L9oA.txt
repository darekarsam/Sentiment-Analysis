5	I am the president of an HOA in the Biltmore area and we recently had Fuze Electric bid & complete a project for us. The owner, Jeff Fehrman, personally made sure that his electricians did the job right. The price was right, the work was done cleanly, and on time, and the electricians at Fuze were polite, and knowledgeable.

5	It doesn't get any better than with Prodigy Electric.  I was selling a home and it was down to crunch time to finish requests from the FHA inspector.  Both the realtor and I got mixed messages of what was required re an exhaust fan over the stove.  It was less than a week from closing and work had to be completed.  I called Prodigy Electric and was able to get an appointment the next day. Cody met me there really early and completed the job within a few hours.  I thought the charges were more than reasonable and will definitely use this contractor again.  Very professional.

Called Cody and he was there within the hour!! He got the job done and we were back in business happy as can be :) Not to mention he was very professional and good looking!!
