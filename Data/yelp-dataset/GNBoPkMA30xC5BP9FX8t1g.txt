5	We have 3 dogs and trying to find time to keep the yard clean was getting to be too much.  Matt met the dogs and they liked him immediately - results not typical.  We have the once a week service and have found that Matt does a fantastic job and the price is right.
5	We've had Matt's Poop Up coming for about 4 months now.  The service is absolutely outstanding.  They've never missed a visit and are very courteous/professional.  We have one beagle and use the twice per month service.  Our yard always looks excellent after they leave.  We are moving out of state and hope we can be so lucky to find a great service like this for our new home.  Thank you!
5	I have 2 large dogs and I couldn't be happier about this service.  I thought about doing it for years but finally decided to try it while I was on an extended trip.  I'm back now but I have to say I'm addicted to this service or maybe spoiled is the better word.  Matt does an amazing job and you would never even know there were dogs when he leaves.  It is so clean!  The service is great.  He is punctual, professional and very courteous and nice.  Goes over and above to do a great job!!  Highly recommend him!
5	I have 2 medium sized dogs, a decently sized back yard, and a hectic work schedule. Needless to say, I was able to get Matt on the phone on a Monday, book  a one time clean up for the following Thursday, and able to pay on his website using Paypal the night it was booked. When I got home Thursday night, the back yard looked GREAT. Matt did a fantastic job and I have saved his companies information for future use.
