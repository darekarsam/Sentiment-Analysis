4	Annoying bureaucracy and dictatorial thesis/dissertation advisors remove the fifth star.  I got my doctorate here, so I know.  This is an amazing, amazing school although the business students couldn't keep a bar afloat in a university ghetto (it is now the St-Hubert on Cote-des-Neiges).  Fantastic library and the place teaches EVERYTHING.  Plus it's loaded with history; my graduation for my master's degree was in the same rotunda out of which Pierre Elliott Trudeau graduated.  He probably spent three long and painful hours of convocation staring at the same rather abstract crucifix.  But the beautiful Art Deco library tower against a brilliant cerulean winter sky will always be in my memory.
