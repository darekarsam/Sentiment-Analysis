5	This is hands down one of the best galleries in Montreal. I literally go see almost anything here because the space is awesome. The exhibition space is set over a number of different levels, each one a smallish room, creating a totally different gallery experience than we're used to. There are elevators and stairs and the exhibition continues all throughout the charming Old Montreal building, and the fact that you can see the work on the different floors in whatever order you like sort of makes you feel like you're contributing to the exhibition yourself.They also have a building across the street which is a more traditional, one-large-room gallery space, but the exhibitions often continue into that space as well. This place is cool!The shows usually combine a variety of multi-media pieces, which makes things interesting. I saw a Sophie Calle show here that I've seen in two other spaces in New York and London, and DHC Art did it best!
5	Went for the Cory Arcangel exhibit, which was a highlight of a trip to Montreal.  DHC/ART has plenty of room to show things in distinct spaces.  The staff are all helpful and professional, and they pick good things to show.Though I wouldn't suspect it would be true for everyone, I found the large projection and audio of out of phase Guns and Roses far more mentally soothing than the cathedral of Notre Dame. (This part only applies to the current show which is there until November 24, 2013.)Oh, and it's legitimately free, so just go see all of the things.  I mean, it's a gallery, so you could probably potentially set up a purchase, but it doesn't really come up when you're there or anything.
