3	I think there're more wines than whiskies here, and the whiskies are kept behind counters where they're less than accessible (without asking, anyway), but there's a decent selection of both wines and whiskies and the staff are happy to talk to you about them all.
2	Not very friendly...Town centre, high street prices...More geared towards tourists.
5	On my last day in Edinburgh I was rushing to find a whisky in a smaller size requested by my boyfriend. I had limited space in my bag to bring it home, and I had only found this specific whisky in full sized.I was immediately greeted by a gentleman who helped me find the whisky I was after! He also pointed me in the direction of good whisky fudge. Very helpful, knowledgeable staff and quite the collection of whiskies!
2	Not friendly, very high prices. I would definately NOT recommend to buy a Single malt there. No whisky professionals. Unfortunately.
