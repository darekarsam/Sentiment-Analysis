1	I so wanted to like this place.  Stopped in on a Thursday night, giddy with dessert excitement.  It took awhile for someone to acknowledge us and take our order.  The waitstaff seemed stressed, annoyed, and inexperienced.  But at this point I'm still thinking it's all going to be worth it.  What a disappointment.  The desserts we tried were bland and dry.  I tend to like things that aren't overly sweet, so it's not that I was expecting an explosion of sweetness and flavor, but I was expecting *some* flavor.  Especially for the price!  Maybe they have something worth eating, but I'm not going to waste any more of my time or money to find out.  The one plus - the water must be filtered because it was actually drinkable.
