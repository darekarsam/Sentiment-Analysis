5	Really, I almost don't want to tell you about this business because they might get too busy for me!  But, I will review anyway.When I moved into my house, I needed some things done:  mesh added to my side gate and painted to match, really big peep hole in my front door, other security type stuff.  Henderson House Doctors was recommended to me and I am so thankful!  They were professional, fast, clean and I felt comfortable having them in my home.  I just called them again to hang some ceiling lights and can't wait to see the job done.  If you need a handyman for your house in Henderson, call them!
5	Henderson House Doctors was referred to me for the installation of a large and HEAVY island style hood in my old Las Vegas house.  They had to do some SERIOUS modifications to the hood to make it work for my kitchen but they were able to handle it with no problems - including cutting metal brackets to size.  I was so impressed with the installation that I called them back to finish/replace the drywall of the soffit I'd destroyed in a moment of delusional "do it yourself" prowess.  He doesn't judge :)  And it's GORGEOUS.  I work for an insurance company and I have a hard time referring handymen out to clients but I've already starting referring him.  There's nothing he can't fix.  I agree with the previous reviewer - I don't want everyone to know about him as he'll get to busy for my large list of "to do" (that includes everything from outside concrete block wall work to building my outdoor kitchen from scratch) but he's worth it and I highly recommend.  If I knew how to post pictures I'd post them...sorry.
