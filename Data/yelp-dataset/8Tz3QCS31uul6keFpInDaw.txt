2	One of the things I hate about changing phone companies is finding a decent store to handle the actual process of changing phones. Sure, you can do it online, but there is invariably something that comes up where it just helps to have someone to ask questions and ease the transition.Unfortunately, the majority of T-Mobile locations in the greater Charlotte area are all reseller locations, and to make matters worse, a lot of them are hidden in really difficult spots to find or sandwiched at the end of strip malls or in leftover space that probably should not house stores at all.Perhaps some combination of those facts explains why the employees at this particular location are not all that friendly. Or maybe they have other issues. Don't know really, but I would rather drive across town to find someone else to handle anything. Or go online. Or switch to another carrier and pay the ETF. Not a fan, even though they are one of the closest locations to me.
4	I got a new cell phone (Nexus 5! Yay!!) as a birthday gift but it didn't come with a SIM card. T-Mobile wanted $10 online for one and I would have to wait for it to be shipped, so I decided to head into a store. I happened to be closest to this location. When I walked in there was one employee helping a customer. He greeted me and said someone would help me soon. Another employee came out of the back room to help me. He was very friendly and not only got me the SIM card I needed, but also set everything up for me. Overall, I had a good experience at this store. The store is on the smaller side, compared to other locations I've been to.
1	Do not trust T-Mobile! Their salespeople and Corporate support have lied to me about my initial signal strength and lied about a tower that was coming to my area just to get me past the buyers remorse period. No integrity at all as recently demonstrated by the overbilling scandal uncovered by the FTC.
