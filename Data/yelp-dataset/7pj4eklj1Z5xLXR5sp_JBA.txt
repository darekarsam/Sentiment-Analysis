3	Manifest down the road offered me 4 times as much for my old cd's than 2nd&Charles. I sold a recent, popular hardback and 4 cd's to 2nd and Charles and they offered me either $3.60 in store credit or $1.60 in cash. Really?I took the same items to Manifest, down the road, and they purchased more of my items and gave me $18.60 in cash. 2nd&Charles is big, pretty and cleaner looking that Manifest, but it's a bit too sterile for my tastes. Manifest is the cooler, more generous cousin.
3	This place is kind of cool... It's a typical used store collection of movies, books, games etc. I found 3 books which was incredible as their organizing structure leaves a lot to be desired. It's a definite commercial place so unless you're looking to sell you aren't going to really find good deals or anything. Decent place to peruse and maybe find a random awesome item on a random weeknight!
4	Wanting to clear out some older things, I read the reviews here and tried taking some stuff to Manifest first. They offered barely anything for what little they took, but I didn't want to go home with the stuff. I drove up the street to 2nd and Charles next, and not only did they take everything I had (and this includes stuff like Daredevil, Elektra, and Fantastic Four on DVD), but they gave me a really good deal for all of it. I regret ever going to Manifest now. If their selection of products for sale were a bit better, this would definitely be a five-star review. I may come back and change it later if the selection improves over time.
