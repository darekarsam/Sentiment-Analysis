3	The seating area to the immediate left of the stand was completely filthy (it was 10 a.m.). Good hot dogs, but way over priced. I get it...Vegas. LOL!
2	I used to love this place when I flew out of McCarran, got my hometown fix of a  Italian beef. Been a year or more since I've been here, but it seems like they've changed. First of all Chicago dogs are served on poppy seed buns  not sesame seed buns!!!!My companion ordered a PLAIN Chicago dog and they wanted to charge a dollar more for a pickle spear, no relish, no tomato, nothing else but a pickle on it. Its not a Chicago dog if its plain!!!. Its just a hot dog masquerading on that pathetic sesame seed bun. The $8.99 Italian beef is incredibly small, and I'm not sure what kind of beef is actually used, but not positive its a Vienna product.  Tables dirty, 1 worker there, incredibly understaffed for prime hours at the airport. Not to mention  I stood there for 3 minutes while my beef got cold under the ledge out of my sight ready. The one employee had 8 people in line . Dear Al, step it up,  your squandering a fantastic opportunity to serve quality Chicago food, and seriously, a $1.05 for a pickle spear when I just spent 20 bucks?  I shall be taking my Chicago food cravings to the Chicago Dog house or to Sonio's cafe  instead from now on.  I'm not complaining about prices because I know its the airport, but you used to do better.
2	Over priced, the hot dog meat tasted on the tainted side. Half way through the bun got tough to eat. I was going to get a soda but I could have gotten a six pack for the same price.  Will eat some where else next time.
1	At most five inch sub with pre packaged meats and non hygienic food service.  Five bucks for small bottled water.  Overall cost ~$15.  This place leech off of poor tourists. Cheaper and better to eat at Starbucks.   I'm not kidding
