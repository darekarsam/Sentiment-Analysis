5	Dr. Stout is the best dentist I've ever had, and he's handsome to boot (think a young Billy Dee Williams).  Both he and his staff are caring, humorous, and proficient at what they do.  The office is conveniently located to Dilworth, Downtown, Plaza Midwood, Myers Park and Elizabeth/Chantilly.  I have had a couple of emergencies, in addition to my regular cleanings, and they've worked me in immediately.  They feel like family to me!
5	Dr. Stout is an incredible dentist. He and the staff are extremely personable and take such great care of you! Everyone on staff knows you by name and take a genuine interest in your life. I have had nothing but great experiences there- painless procedures, regular cleanings, and a great source of advice. I would strongly recommend choosing this dentist- you will not be sorry!
5	The staff is always pleasant, courteous and exhibits exceptional skill.  In addition to being notably competent himself, Dr. Stout has a "bedside manner" that makes even the most anxious patient feel comfortable. I can say without a doubt that you will not find a better dental care team in Charlotte.
