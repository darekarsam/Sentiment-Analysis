5	The Best In The Valley.
5	3 times I have returned , each and every time I leave satisfied! I am not a sushi eater but here I eat sushi! its that good. I love how everyone takes pride in the food the serve even the young teen who took our order. He did a fist pump when we said the food was awesome! He also recommended other dishes for the future which sound delicious but the Mango Sweet dish will always be my favorite!!
2	I ordered the Mango Sweet, which according to the menu is brown rice, breaded chicken and mango salsa. What I received was an orange chicken type white rice bowl without a single trace of mango salsa. When I asked our server if the salsa was already in the bowl, he said yes, so I guess my definition of salsa must just be different from theirs. Despite that, the flavors were okay, enough to satisfy a super hungry stomach, but it's highly doubtful that I'll be coming back.
5	The best Mexican Japanese sushi ever very authentic fast service and out standing flavors!!! You should come and try it !!!
