5	I went to see the new dentist at Brannon dental Dr. Waldman and he was so professional, and thorough. Great attitude, I was a little worried since I have been going there for 3 years and have seen two other Dentists. I am very pleased that he has partnered up with Dr. B, so he will be there long term. Love the friendly staff. alot of changes but for the better I think:)
4	My whole family goes here. From braces to wisdom teeth extractions - they have done it all for us . Nice office and very nice people.
5	Hands down the BEST dentist I've had! I knew from my very first visit which was very unexpected/emergency visit, that Dr. Waldman would be MY dentist. He's amazing and Jessie his hygienist is just as amazing!!! I heart them :-) They are extremely professional, thorough, clean and comforting. Yet, so fun and personable. They go above and beyond to make sure IM okay. They work with my budget and I have options! I always have options!! The whole team is fabulous and I would not recommend going anywhere else!!! Gahhhh love them all!!!
