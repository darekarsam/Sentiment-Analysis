5	This place was our second stop for getting a laminate quote for our new home. Eric and his family where so friendly and knowledgable! Eric really took his time to explain the different products and installation process. After measuring (and some issues with our closing costs being more than they should have...) we were slightly over budget for the laminate and new base. Eric was more than willing to try and find ways to cut costs and make us happy. After eliminating 1 room and base we came up with a price that we both agreed on. Eric's guys started 2 days early to my surprise and were all very friendly when I made a pit stop at the house and saw they were there. They finished in 2 days and left the home very clean. I would highly recommend this family owned business to anyone! Hopefully when we can, we will be using them for carpet replacement in the remaining areas of our house and finally get that baseboard we dream of. Thanks for a job well done guys! Love supporting locally family owned small business!
5	Stopped by while searching for some supplies for a DIY flooring project. Personal service was spectacular! I have some pretty unique issues with my project and the folks at the store figured out what I would need, called their suppliers to find the best deal, and arranged for me to pick it up right away instead of waiting for it to be shipped into the store.Great pricing, great service. I highly recommend these guys!
5	Eric and the entire team at Future Floors had one thing in mind, our total satisfaction! We have been to a few flooring retailers and there was always a question left in our minds about something, but with future floors that was different from the moment we walked in until the flooring installers left. The attention to detail and the craftsmanship is top notch. We are absolutely satisfied with the end-to-end experience of Eric and the Future Floor experts.
