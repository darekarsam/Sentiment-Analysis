5	Fast.  Efficient.  Affordable.  Does one need to say more?  Best service I have had on my drip system to date!  Thank you!   I highly recommend this company to anyone needing drip system or sprinkler service!
5	I have used Chris and his crew multiple times for both repair and changes to my sprinkler system. They answer the phone, make an appointment and show up when they say they will. The work is done quickly and I have never had to call them back a second time for a repair that they have made.
5	We had an issue with our dripper system causing some minor flooding in the backyard from when we had pulled some plants.We called Affordable Sprinkler Repair, and Chris told us he would have someone out in 30 minutes...Jason arrive even a bit earlier than that and was both extremely friendly, and extremely helpful!Got everything done in a fast and efficient manner at a price far less than what I had expected.Awesome service, and I would use it again in a heart beat.  I'll be recommending them to my neighbors in our new development.
