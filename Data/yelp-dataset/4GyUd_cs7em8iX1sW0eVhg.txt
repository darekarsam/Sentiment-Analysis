2	This banking center is horrible! The staff are nice and pleasant, but the service quality definitely leaves something good to be desired. At the busiest part of the day, they decide to send all but one of their bank tellers on break. So you got one teller, for a line of 7 or more people. And then the hostess says "thank you for spending you time" in their bank. This banks management really needs to get their heads out of their little office or where ever it is, and schedule their tellers to work around busy schedules.
3	I use Bank Of America as a business account not a personal account. They are nice and friendly and I love that they have a much faster and smaller merchant line. Not so thrilled when it comes to personal accounts though considering their past history. My husband held a personal account for a while but was quick to close it down
