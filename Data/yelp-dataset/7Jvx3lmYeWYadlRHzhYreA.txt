4	The Boardwalk is the huge big box development that straddles the border of Kitchener and Waterloo on the west end of town.  With a great number of big box store favorites of mine including Walmart and Bed Bath and Beyond, as well as restaurants such as Swiss Chalet and Milestones and even an Empire Theatre, this is a great place to shop.  Not long ago I was able to pick up a nice gift, have a nice dinner, and watch a great movie all at The Boardwalk... now that's convenience!
1	1.5/5...really?Gotta love how planners in this region put big box developments right next to a landfill site, eh? Yes, it smells here!I'm never a fan of big box sites, and this is no exception. The stores are simply not walkable to one another since the area is so big. Besides, does anyone even shop here? I've never seen the parking lot more than 20% full! What a waste of space.I do like the Empire Theatre though, but in terms of the design of this place...a huge step backwards in promoting environmental sustainability (and no, those sidewalk engravings don't do you any good).
