5	This great bakery just opened up before Christmas and I have not tried everything yet, but I keep coming back for more!  Their sandwich bread is great, their cheese breads are amazing, their cinnamon and orange rolls are delicious, and their cookies and other desserts are outstanding!  The staff is extremely friendly!
5	We LOVE this bakery! The breads are perfect. We've tried Honey Wheat (deliciously sweet), Light Wheat (a blend of white & wheat breads, not as dense but just as delicious), Chocolate Babka (airy white bread blended with Ghirardelli semi sweet chocolate twisted throughout, uh ya, yum!), Blueberry-Peach (perfect for breakfast), Tomato Basil (elevates any sandwich), and their Ciabatta (spongy with a chewy crust with a hint of olive oil & salt). Their Carmelitas are addictive (cookie bar layered with creamy caramel and quality chocolate). Raspberry scones, cookies, & brownies are all incredible.
5	This new bakery is amazing delicious! The whole wheat bread is so Heavenly! The cinnamon rolls are the best I ever had! Staff is really friendly!
