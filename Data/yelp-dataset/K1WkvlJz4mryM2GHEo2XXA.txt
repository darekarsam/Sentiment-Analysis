4	I know I am bias....I walk into Au Pain Dore and I know I love it even before laid my eyes on their pastries and baked goods.That smell... that devilish buttery smell... that fresh from oven smell....Then the staff smiles at me saying "Bonjour! What can I do for you...." It starts with just a croissant ... anything else... coconut marcoons.. that's it...Apple turnovers looks good...Let's have some Artisan bread to go with the pate and the goat cheese and the cured meat from Marche Jean-Talon.That's it! Are you sure?The staff just keep smiling..... Silly tourist...
5	Croissants are outstanding - we've been back every day for nearly a week because they are so good, and we are staying in the area. The croissants are light, but substantive, not greasy and perfectly flaky. Really great.They also have a good deal that you get any kind of coffee for $2 with the purchase of a croissant. Had a blueberry Danish which was not only beautiful to look at but really delicious -- not overly sweet, lots of wild blueberries and a hint of creamy cheese. Also had their almond croissant which was delightful.The only downside of this place is that everything looks, smells, and tastes so good that it's really hard to decide what to get!
4	Amazing croissant and bread! However, what I love most about this place is.... this jar of salted caramel maple sauce that I bought at this place for $10 CAD. It's this combination of sweet and salted, thick gooey sauce.. goes great with bread, ice-cream, etc.. Or just simple grab a spoon and start eating it as if it's nutella from a jar (but even better)! Anyway, I also appreciated the friendly staff. After my only French phrase, "Bonjour", I resorted to English and they were just as friendly and helpful. In fact, the staff gave me a spoonful of that caramel maple sauce to try... and I instantly fell in love. Just writing this review is making me hungry and craving to go eat some now.... and perhaps, I should. So, au revoir, mes amis!
