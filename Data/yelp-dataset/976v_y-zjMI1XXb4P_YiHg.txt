5	I have ordered clothing from them a few times and they have shipped it right away, so from Montreal to Calgary it arrived within a few days. They have a great selection of hempwear at fair prices. I will likely order from them again. I am pleased with their service, prices and selection.
5	They were very friendly and let me charge my vaporizer for free when I left my power adaptor in Toronto. I was happy to find they had an excellent selection hemp products including Dr Bronners at fair price. They also had a wide range of merchandise such as books, paraphernalia, and clothing.I like the location a lot because easy to access from lots of public transit and it's in one of the nicest neighbourhoods in Mtl.
