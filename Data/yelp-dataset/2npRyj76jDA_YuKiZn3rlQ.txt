1	I walked into this very dark, shady looking location, and the Asian male counter person had an attitude right off the bat.  I said I'd need 4 foot longs but that I needed a few more minutes to decide. He said "duh, when you make the very difficult decision of what bread you want, we can make your order". I said excuse me?  He said duh again and pointed to the picture of the breads.  I was getting irritated with his extreme rudeness at this point and asked his name.  He said Jan.  I said "I'm Going to a different location because you're too rude".   Response?  "Oh no. Bye".    I drove down 88 to south park shops and went to Panera Bread. Then went home and wrote subway a letter.  I even took the little sh*ts picture.  I'll never return to subway. Pretty astonished at the kids rudeness, even in today's horrible customer service atmosphere.   He was truly the worst person I've ever encountered in fast food, and that's saying a lot.
1	This place is terrible. I've gone there maybe 10 times only to have the same result. Miserable employees that don't utter one more word than necessary to complete the transaction and only make eye contact with you to let you know they are annoyed with you and that you are a burden to them. Every time I go it's the same two people the miserable younger girl and the miserable Hispanic girl. They don't even want to give the effort required to cut past the top of the bun. I'm always left with tearing my meat, veggies and bottom bun in half. I'm done with this location. I'll drive the extra distance to Banksville or one of the other food spots in the immediate area. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!
1	Chalk up another one for this place being awful. Poor service. I order the monthly special and get charged full price. Not friendly at all. I just live so damn close it's hard to resist. I guess I will just have to quit Subway for a while.
