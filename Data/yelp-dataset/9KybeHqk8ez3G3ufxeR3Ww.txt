4	A bright, pleasant breakfast spot close to our hotel.  We ate here several times during our 2 weeks in Brossard.  Come hungry.  They certainly fill your plate.  Crepes, waffles, pancakes, omelets, blintzes, they have it all.  They serve free coffee with your meals and always make sure it's topped off.The weekday staff speak very little English.  However, a hostess and other staff show up for the weekend morning rush, most of which are competent English speakers.  Either way, we had no problem making understood what we wanted.Can't account for the other negative reviews.  Maybe the people up here have higher standards than what I'm used to back in the States.
5	On a Saturday, (crowded) I had a nice breakfast with my gf. Had a crumbled eggs with pancakes, my coffee was auto-filling up. Service was very fine and well worth 26$ for 2!
