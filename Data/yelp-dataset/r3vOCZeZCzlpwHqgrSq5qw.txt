1	Don't use this company. They don't put due dates on their bills and then get shitty with you when you don't pay your bill on time. How am I suppose to know what is ON TIME, if there is no due date. Also technician accidentally dropped a bunch of chemicals in our yard in a pile. A lot of chemicals in one pile results in DEAD grass. The technician with an 8th grade iq level didn't even bother to tell anyone. When we noticed it, we were offered a very small compensation for their incompetent workers.
1	Never ever use this company. Totally agree with the previous review. Simply, they try to charge for applications they never have done. At the end of season, they suddenly send multiple bills saying they are over due. Worse, communication with this company is a nightmare. I think that there is something wrong with the company (seriously). Someone at the company is making the application record up or cooking the book.
1	NEVER EVER use this company.  They don't tell the truth - they do lousy work and after hundreds of dollars my lawn has huge dead spots and fungus rings.  Most unprofessional "manager" who doesn't know a thing about lawn care. " Stay away be afraid - very afraid
