4	What a wonderful place to stop at for a lunch break here at work.  They have a wonderful daily special that comes with two sides.  I would definitely suggest that you try the Jo's Grilled Chicken Sandwich. MMmmmmm.  Other than that, it is your typical commercial park bfast/lunch hot spot. Oh yeah, they have Texas Pete on every table. Jackpot!  Enjoy!-Ian M.
5	I visited Charlotte a few weeks ago and stopped by the cafe for a quick bite to eat. The food was amazing! I had the pudgy burger and it was very good.  The service was fast and friendly.  I will be sure to visit again the next that I'm in the area!
3	Pretty decent breakfast if you're an employee of Parkway Plaza. Love their turkey bacon, egg white, and cheese on a bagel. Plus they deliver!
