5	My fiance and I took our grandson there for a night just to see what the atmosphere was.  We had a blast.  My grandson who is 6 years old got on the dance floor and danced to the live music.  Which was a mixture of genres.  We went back a couple of weeks later and really enjoyed ourselves again.  We are getting a group together for this Saturday for another live show.My fiance and I were the youngest people in the room, however we still had an amazing time as everyone was there to have fun and dance the night away..  We are definitely going to be regulars!!!
1	It is my first & last stop here ! They are horrible ! I ordered fry fish & Chopped steak, which should come with mushroom & steamed veggies ..... Yes, chopped steak they brought it was humbugger patty with horrible mushroom gravy and canned carrots ..... all food love for 10.95..... Really???? Humbugger patty... I said thanks, it is not what I ordered @ what written on menu ... Waitress charged me 50% of my plate , which she took back!!!!!! Wow! Fish was sooooo greasy & French frys sooooo dark which swimmed in old oil !!!!! OMG !!!! I had to actually fight & tell them to fix a bill. Will I be back there??????? Yeah, no guesses!!!! Hell nooooooo
5	Some friends brought to BB's last night for the fish fry. For $4.95 I wasn't expectiang much. Boy was I wrong! LOL It came with 2 good size pieces of fish, very good fries and some coleslaw. Plus a slice of lemon and tartar sauce! And they even had Pinot Grigio wine available. If your looking for fine dining and fancy, this is not it. If your looking for decent food for a decent price and very good service, I highly recommend. The place from the front looks like a little hole in the wall, but it's HUGE inside!
