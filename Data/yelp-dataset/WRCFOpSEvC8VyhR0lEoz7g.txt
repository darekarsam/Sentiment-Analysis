4	This place is a true gem, located in Villeray on lovely de Castelnau street. It is a small temple dedicated to artisanal, fabulous chocolate, including an amazingly rich hot chocolate and chocolate pies. The shop is decorated in rich, warm wood and shades of chocolate and champagne and has a cute little counter overlooking the street. You can tell the guy who owns it is seriously passionate about his trade. Definitely a must-visit place for any chocolate lover- it must also be noted that Chocobel's chocolates are also sold at the O Cha Noir tea shop in Verdun.
4	a gem located just north of JTM that offers deep rich intricate chocolate bite sizes. every bite is packed with flavor striking a perfect balance between the rich chocolate and the filling (whatever that may be).you can find the regular ones (caramel, grand marnier, raspberry) or if you are a bit more daring, you can always venture into some of their crazy concoctions. my personal favorite: the tomato (green and yellow) chocolate. tomato you say? weird mix but it works. the bitter dark chocolate combine with the sweetness of the tomato, it just bursts into your mouth for one heck of an experience.besides the bite size, they have brownies, nougat, truffles, chocolate bars, hot chocolate, coffee and macarons.the boutique only houses about 4 seats at the counter.i have frequent the place for years now and have never been disappointed. it does get expensive but you get a slight discount the more you buy.
