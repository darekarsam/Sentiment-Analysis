5	If your visiting or live in Arizona this is a great place to get your tattoo done. I heard they even do permanent make up now that I might have to try on my next visit.
5	I have been to New Heights Tattoo & Piercing multiple times and have been more than happy with the service that has been given to me. The staff is very friendly and welcoming and the shop is a clean, comfortable environment to be in. Chris Hill has pierced and tattooed me multiple times and I couldn't be happier with the results. I plan on going here in the future for any other work I would like done. I would also recommend anyone looking for quality service to go to new heights, you won't be disappointed.
5	Great family owend tattoo shop. Great work and clean and invtinig environment.
5	Was referred to this place by a few friends. Im not into this stuff at all but got a gift certificate  for a family member to get a piercing.  they were super nice and made me feel at ease in this new environment.  the place was very clean and modern.  Im even thinking of looking into getting a tattoo.  not sure yet. We will see.
2	This place was great when Chris and his wife were running it. I got a beautiful tattoo on my foot. Then went back to add more to it, Chris was gone and Tony just messed it up so bad.
5	Absolutely love every experience I've had with this shop. I've gotten both piercings and tattoos here by various artists/piercers and they're all fantastic. They make it an enjoyable experience no matter how nervous I am. I am always impressed with their cleanliness and professionalism. Plus this shop has a wide open floor plan rather than being hidden in multiple small rooms, which I cannot express how much I love. 5 stars from me for sure!
5	Had two ear piercings and a very small tattoo done yesterday. Staff was professional and shop seemed very clean! I was happy with my experience and will probably go back for more in the future.
