4	Dr Tiffany is great! We bring our son here and his cousins go here too.  Lots of good info for new parents, very professional and caring. Most of the time when you have a little one who's sick they can squeeze you in to be seen, which is a plus.
4	I can't say much about Dr.Tiffany. I personally prefer to see Nurse Practitioner Pam Grant. I love her. She treats me like if I was family and cares for my little one as if she were Her family as well. Usually at a clinic the Dr will only take care of one concern and ask you to come back and talk about other concerns and.usually they are in and out of the room. It's not like that here. I can say I spend 15 to 20 min with the Dr. Well in our case with Pam. We love the attention and Care.
5	I love love love Dr Tiffany and her office! She's very thorough, caring and experienced.  She took the time to chat and get to know our family while at the hospital doing her rounds checking on our newborn.  The office staff is honestly the nicest and happiest I've ever experienced at ANY dr office!!  They fit you in when needed, they always try to accommodate my schedule, everyone greets you so joyfully.  Not to mention I really like how the office is always clean, they have good info and brochures. It's always a good experience going there. THANK YOU DR Tiffany, Martha and STAFF!
