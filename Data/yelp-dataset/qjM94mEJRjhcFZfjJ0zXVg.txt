2	Food took ages and arrived cold, but would have otherwise been plain but satisfying. Atmosphere is casual and fun, but this place is quite crowded -- perhaps better for a group of cheerful beer-swillers than a couple who were already pretty hungry -- and the service was very slow.
4	Probably not the best food ever but German classics for quite cheap if you pick one of the "hammers".The place is decorated with nice old ads and is generally crowded.
3	Ist halt 'ne Studi-Kneipe, aber gut zu weggehen und 'ne Kleinigkeit zu Essen gibts auch. wenn man hungrig ist.
