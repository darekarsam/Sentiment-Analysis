5	I have lived my whole life in vegas and love to karaoke. I have been to a couple here in Vegas but by far Bazic is phenomenal! The  food is delicious and the selection of music is incredible. They have a lot of new music from new artist. The beer and prices are reasonable as well . This is definitely my one and only karaoke place in Vegas.
5	I absolutely love this place!!! The music selection is great it has not only a lot of oldies but goodies but also a bunch of new stuff!!! The staff is great,  the chef is awesome, and the prices are even better! Best spring rolls of my life are at this place!!! This is ny go to kareoke spot.
3	Its an OK.... Joint. Good service. The bartender is really nice and fast. And the menu is good for quick late night apps. The karaoke rooms need to be alil speuced up. But would come back again
2	Bring back the old wings! Used to love this place but now they serve wings that are larger than life, might as well serve the whole chicken. No more deri-q. Sad face...Only upside is that their corn cheese and kimchi fried rice are still tasty.
