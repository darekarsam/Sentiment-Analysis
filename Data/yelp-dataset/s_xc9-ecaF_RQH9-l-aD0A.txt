5	Great variety of vegan treats and every single one is delicious.  Best vegan baked goods I've ever had!
5	Amazingly delicious! Finally, something vegan that's not trying to be healthy! Sometimes you just gotta indulge!
5	So, I was with my fiance visiting family in Vegas, and we had a mix of Vegan and non-Vegan people to feed. It can be difficult to find something that satisfies both but Bite def did the trick. Personally, I thought the food was way better than many versions I've had with dairy/eggs, etc. Pretty shocking actually! Highly recommend the monkey bread and caramels.The Vegan eaters in the group found a new favorite place and they go to the market to stock up on the Bite goodies on a weekly basis now.
5	Best chocolate cake I ever tasted. We love her baked goods. And the prices are good. Bite rocks.
5	Grabbed a pie shaped chocolate chip cookie (made with chickpeas) for my picky 2 year old. She barely let me have one bite but it was amazing!
5	My favorite vegan treats in town! Every Saturday at Tivoil, it's a must. I need to start getting 2 of each cause they are to good to share
5	Best waffle I have ever had! Amazing other sweet treats as well. Also super sweet people. Two thumbs up for sure.
5	Holly is so sweet just like her desserts. I've been coming to the market solely for Bite and Veg Out. Bite has a great selection of goods and many are gluten free. Total brownie points! I fell in love with the chocolate raspberry cake and I've been coming back for it. I had her waffles a few weeks back and it's still one of the lightest, fluffiest, tastiest waffle I've ever had!
5	My first time trying Bite products, and may I say, the raspberry chocolate cake is luscious, fudgy (is that a word?) and simply decadent. Can't wait to come back next week and try something new.
