4	Stopped there for lunch during vacation. Place is nice and simple. Very extensive lunch menu, most of the selections are $6.99, plus cappuccino/espresso can be added for $2. All dishes are served with green salad. All food was good, with Chicken Quiche being the best. Cappuccino was very good, served in a beautiful coffee cup.Definitely recommended for nice and simple lunch.
5	I rarely go to the same place more than once when I am on vacation.  This was an exception. I was staying at the Sheraton a couple blocks away and ended up going to Cafe Imagination 3 times in my 3 day stay! I went twice for lunch and had their delicious chicken quesadilla (at a very very reasonable price), and all three times topped it off with chocolate croissants.  I even bought one for the road and snuck it through customs back into NYC for my gf.  Unfortunately, I am still getting texts from my cousin about how delicious the chocolate croissant was that I left in his car!
3	Great place for a quiet and healthy lunch - very inexpensive with good service - try the Ciabatta  Toscane .
5	The ambiance was great. It's close from my work near downtown. The food is healthy and the prices are average. The service was professional and very courteous. I had a quesadilla with a salad. Just the right amount of food.Definitely going back again.
3	Service is very friendly and I really like the big spacious dinning area. But the food is very bland. Not much taste at all.
