5	Ok...we're on vacation and we took an unwanted but very necessary trip to the chiropractor. First things first....we called around all over the place and we're very pleased that someone finally answered the phone and expressed compassion and a desire to help. Once we got in the door, the service was even better! I'm thankful for the staff and the work that they did. If you're looking for a chiropractor in Las Vegas...these are the people.
5	Looooove them! Thee best place ever for any chiropratic needs or medical needs! Dr. Michael Sobran and his staff are the most compassionate and caring staff ever. We came across him on an emergency visit for my husband on a friday evening @ 4:30 and Dr. Sobran himself answered the phones there and told us to come right in! He examines his patients thoroughly and he works with you to get you the best results. I now see him for my back problems and surgery is not his first option. He's an alternative medicine Dr so he believes in therapeutic treatments and not going under the knife right away! :) I recommend him and his staff to everyone!
5	Hear hear to the staff at Progressive Health Center! I've been a patient for the last 3 years and it has always been a wonderful experience. Dr. Michael Sobran is the best and takes care of his patients very well! He has always been very compassionate and you can tell his patients come first. I definitely recommend him and his business for all your medical needs, especially physiotherapy...:)
5	Great friendly staff here!   I drive out of my way to go here.  Awesome relaxed atmosphere.  The Doctors really focus on your individual needs.  Masseuses are amazing.
