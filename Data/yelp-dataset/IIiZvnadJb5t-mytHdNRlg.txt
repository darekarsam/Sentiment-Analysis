4	I was looking for a 7-Eleven and this popped up. Great little shop and yes, they're friendly. When I walked in, I was greeted with a welcoming "Hello. Welcome."I found a reasonable selection of candies and sodas. As well, an ATM that only charges $2.25. A deal!Sadly, the lottery scratch ticket I bought was not a winner, so no fifth star. (I'm kidding.)
3	Typical convenience store with a decent selection of snacks and beverages.  I was very happy with the selection of local beers they had.The only down side was the fact that the milk they were selling was either already expired or set to expire in the next day or two.
