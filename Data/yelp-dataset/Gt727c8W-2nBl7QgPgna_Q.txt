3	The only thing good about sushi shop is that if you go at closing time they give you free sushi boxes! Its not the best quality, but its cheap and on the go! There is not that many people here, since their is so many restaurants in proximity you never have to wait.
3	Since it's a franchise it's easy to find it! I really like the inferno roll and the quality is pretty much the same everywhere so its good! Avocado roll are really good when it's cold Cheers,Eric Van Nguyen
1	First time going here & my last. Not setup like any sushi place I've been to before, looks like the McDonalds of sushi.  Place was pretty empty, only 3 other customers & no one bothered to talk to us for more than 5 minutes, finally someone asked if we needed help. Then we said we would like to order, they said we couldn't eat it inside. If they would have greeted us right away and told us they were closing soon, we could have left right away instead of wasting our time. Go here for bad service & probably low quality sushi.Go to Yuzu instead, a much better place!!!
