2	Big group on Christmas Eve ate here. It was ok. I have had better and I have had worse. The Caesar Salad was good. The fish looked good. The red sauces didn't look so hot. The pasta is fresh and tastes pretty good. Some of the classic recipes they changed up, so I subtracted a star for that. I also didn't like the sarcastic humor of the waiter. The wine was awful and was suggested by the server. I also subtracted a star because the waiter argued with a lady at our table because he brought her order over and it was wrong. He blamed her and said, "Well you SHOULD have said..." I have never seen a waiter act like that before. I was embarrassed for him. Lame. If given the choice, I wouldn't find many reasons to return to this restaurant. It would be easier to find better on all fronts: service, food quality, ambiance, etc.

This place place makes a mean chicken parm. Juicy chicken cutlet, smothered in sauce and cheese, taking up half your plate....that's good times. It's served with a very uniquely shaped spaghetti that is absolutely essential to this dish. So essential that if they changed shape of pasta I would probably protest. The dish is like your Nonna's Sunday night dinner except its available every day. I recommend.
