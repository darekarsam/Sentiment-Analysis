4	This sushi place is located way out of our usual radius since we live downtown, but I'm glad we went! What really sets this place apart from other sushi restos in the city is the attention to detail and the distinct sauces that come with the various rolls. One roll had a nice and unexpectedly tangy vinegary sauce, another had a mustard-based sauce and yet another roll had a sweeter one. Unlike a lot of other sushi places, many of the rolls vary in ingredients, so you don't feel like you're just ordering the same roll several times. The fish tasted fresh, probably one of the top "fresh" tasting places I've been to in Montreal.The service was friendly, and clearly the owners care about their product. The interior was cute, red walls and buddhas around. They also do more than just sushi and have bento boxes/cooked stiry-fry meals, etc. I actually much preferred the quality of the food and the setting to Saint Sushi, which seems to be all the rave right now. To top it off, it's a BYOW. I would definitely go back!
4	Probably one of the better non all you can eat sushi restaurants in Montreal. I've visited most of the sushi restos in the greater Montreal area and have had no success besides the new Kinka and Imadake izakayas. Resos are a must because the weekends can be pretty busy. They use fresh fish and the presentation is beautiful. I'm from the west coast so the sushi prices can be a bit more expensive. Other than that I would definitely recommend trying this restaurant.
