5	All three of my kids has been coming here starting with my daughter at 18 monthsand now she's in kindergarten and still goes when she's on break. Mrs. Brandi and her staff are very nice and will treat you and your kids with respect. She has renovated the center twice since and it looks better and better every time. It's clean I never seen any bugs or rats. I have even seen all of the staff clean every night before they leave. One thing I really loved is the fact that even though I'm so busy with work and school they actually prepared my daughter for kindergarten she actually got into the school she's in because Watch Me Grow is accredited and so they actually teach your kids. I am also seeing the same improvements with my son that is about to be two, which is also another plus for me because, I know that the staff is teaching the kids knowledge and not just taking it as being a daycare but also a learning environment.
5	My son started going here when my second child was born and needed multiple surgeries and many doctors appointments. He is three years old and was never in any kind of child care or away from us for any kind of time. They have been amazing for the past ten months with him and he has grown so much in that time. The teachers and entire staff are great not only with our son but with us as parents as well. With our other son and his surgeries and special needs he has not been enrolled in this program yet. I feel very comfortable as soon as he recovers from his last surgery that I can show them his special feeding needs and that he will also been in excellent hands. For the growth of both of my children I think watch me grow is the best place for them to interact with other children. Have an educational based daycare and a staff that takes the time and cares. I would not trust anyone else.
