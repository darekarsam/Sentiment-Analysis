4	I believe I have found the elusive... GREAT HONEST mechanic!  I stopped in to have my vehicle checked/prepped for the hot AZ months coming up.  Clean shop, great service.  Hours are a little difficult to work around working an 8 to 5 job but if my car gets this kind of great service..  I'll make arrangements.
1	I was extremely disappointed by the rude treatment I received.  I would not recommend this shop to anyone.  As a matter of fact I got a Yelp account for the sole purpose of rating this shop.
5	James Strang is the man! He's the owner of the shop, and if you're looking for an honest mechanic look no further. James always lets me know what's going on with my car. When I should change something, or how long I have until something will break. This guy takes pride into his work, and it definitely shows. My Honda has +200K thanks to James..
