3	Bistro Bozena specializes in Polish food. The new owner has added homemade perogies, cabbage rolls and other Polish fare to the menu.We just came for the small front patio and some sangria. Sangria was great, strong but kind of overpriced at $25 a pitcher. Cheaper to be found down the street.Waitress here was lovely but unfortunately a bit frazzled as she caught a customer masturbating furiously right at his table only moments before we arrived. Gross!
3	Great little patio on rue St. Denis, it's was freakin' hot outside and we wanted somewhere shaded and this fit the bill.The menu offers Polish fare...and though their beer is pretty cheap, the sangria was pricey.  However, I cannot complain.  It was delicious and we were thirsty.Only issued I have is with the chatty old dude who wouldn't stop talking to us.  I guess he was trying to be friendly, but I can only listen to someone say "try the cider, their ciders' the best" so many times before I lose my shit!  Thankfully, he got the hint and left.  But not until AFTER he told us about some perv sitting at a table with his junk out having traumatized our server minutes before.
4	Nothing can compare to my mom's homemade cabbage rolls but this pub version was came quite close. Enjoyed a conversation with the owner and both enjoyed a shot of vodka (actually two). Also, discovered a fantastic local ale on tap 'Chanvre Blonde' from La micro de Bromont. Warm atmosphere, comfort food and great beer.
