4	The Pharmacy is helpful and staffed properly. The counter person always greets you as you walk in the door. The layout is functional and easy to find what you are looking for.  It is also very clean. What more can I say? Nice experience.
1	Horrible customer service. I'm not sure how the photo supervisor got the job because he has no social skills. The store is convenient but after having 4 awful experiences I will make the trip up to walgreens where I have only received great customer service. Thanks for the let down CVS.
5	This store is close to my home, so I am in there at least once a week. I can easily get in and out of the store, which is excellent for convenience shopping. The store is immaculate, and I can easily find anything that I'm looking for. I have found every staff member of the store to be pleasant, helpful and accommodating. In addition, the staff that work in the pharmacy are also some of the nicest people I've met. They know who I am, and make me feel welcome and appreciated to be coming to their pharmacy. I also applaud CVS' move to stop selling cigarettes. I think this is a  progressive company, and is committed to the health of our country. I prefer this store over the Walgreens that is in my area. I find Walgreen stores to be dirty, with lots of stuff laying in the aisles and no one to help.  In addition, the Walgreens rewards program is a total joke, while I always get heaps and heaps of coupons at CVS. I choose to visit this CVS over any other store that sells similar products and provide similar services in my neighborhood. If you're in the North Valley, and you need to go to a CVS store, this one is the best...
