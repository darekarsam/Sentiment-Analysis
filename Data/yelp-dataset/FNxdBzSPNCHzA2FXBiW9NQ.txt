3	Any time I've visited for appointments they are always running late,  which annoys the hell out of me for many reasons.  The staff are always pleasant so can't complain there.  It's a hospital that already seems to be grown out of and already expanding from the original building to accomodate the sick kids.  it would be great of they have the lauriston building dept and the eye pavillion out here too.  Even an audiology dept would be good, saves me going into town.  It seems to look clean, but to enter an entrance that is meant to be strictly smoke free through a smokers cloud makes me scream red.  Car parks are to front and rear and seem to fill up fast.Need I go on?
1	Don't go here. Ever. Unless you have a scalpel sticking out of you, or some other lethal instrument, for the love of everything, do not go here. Over the past 9 months I've been in and out of this hospital and I've a pretty good idea of the level of "care" here. I'm also from the Netherlands so perhaps used to something better than 1950s Russian-looking mortuary wards.The staff is terrible at communicating, and that's kind of important when they're trying to stick stuff into you. The carpets are downright filthy, at one department I tried four toilets that were filled with diarrhoea before finding a toilet that was functioning and not full of s**t. If you're lucky enough to find a doctor in A&E, be prepared to wait for four hours before being told that you're going to be sent home, and 9 months for a diagnosis that would have been made in a week max in the Netherlands, is apparently, not uncommon.If you're healthy, do not go here, if you're sick, DO NOT come here, as I guarantee that whatever you catch here will be worse than what you had to begin with. This is a sick, sick joke.
