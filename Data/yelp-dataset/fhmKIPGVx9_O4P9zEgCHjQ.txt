2	McDonald's is McDonald's. My "beef" with this place is they stopped selling ice and I prefer not to have to drive all over town in search of ice while wearing pajamas! (See http://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-restaurants-phoenix-44#hrid:jpfxQUBZMuBoIIFn-MWp7g)
2	Pros: It's McDonald's. the food here is OK, and the location is convenient to my house.Cons: slow service, long lines, and have had to pull around several times because of messed up orders. the actual customer service is terrible here. no more ice, especially on a day like the 4th of July. friendly, NO!. never been inside this McDonalds location, only in the corner store, which is a different story!I guess convenience come with a price, not physically but verbally!
1	went back there today and asked for two simple burgers with nothing but ketchup and cheese, not hard, right? apparently it is if your english is as good as your order taking skills
3	I really like the remodeling going on
1	Was there Friday morning around 9am- rudest young guy working the order window and took our payment. That guy has no business in the customer service industry.
