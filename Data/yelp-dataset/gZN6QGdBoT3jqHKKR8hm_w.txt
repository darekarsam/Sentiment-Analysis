4	This is a west side liquor store fo shiz. And it aint' no Bevmo punk; so take your collar popping ass up the road if you want clean and pretty. If it is a crotch flask or a 40 of OE, however; this is the place to rock.I exaggerate a bit. While certainly rough around the edges this is a good place to get your booze, complete with drive through.I stopped in to pick up some supplies to throw an after OYE bash. The guy working the counter looked at my bottle of 15 dollar Smirnoff triple distilled and he says to me "You want better vodka for cheaper?"  Does he not know me at all? Why even ask? I course I effing want better vodka for cheaper, so he took my bottle put it back and grabbed a 12 dollar bottle. I am a happy camper.Yay! I'm a fan...cuz ..you know they sell liquor...and they do it well.

Ive been through here a few times in the past but may or may not have had a little too much to drink and dont recall the experience. However, the fact that they deliver has always made them stand out in my mind. So Friday night on my way home from a family dinner I drove through to get myself some Dos Equis and the man at the window was extremely helpful and pleasant. My boyfriend drinks non alcoholic beer but doesn't like the taste of Odoules, after explaining this the man brought out another brand that happens to be my boyfriends favorite. He had a nice little casual conversation with us and then gave all three of my children some candy. I was surprised by how friendly and patient he was with us, especially on a friday night.
