4	The food was decent (what one would expect from a Nickels restaurant) and the service was amazingly good and friendly. We got there just a few minutes before the closing hour, they let us in and gave us time to order. Then gave us time to eat and really were super nice.
3	The food is not much to write home about. It's very generic and for the geriatric set, good to take elder relatives.But the good thing is the prices are very good (discounts for 60 and over)They serve breakfast til 2:30 and the menu has a bit of everything for everyone.The decor is a bit worn down and the bathroom area needs an overhaul, but with the great service it's overall ok
3	Ugh... I have mixed feelings about this place. The smoked meat sandwiches are mouth-watering, the meat was perfect and the rye bread was not dry at all.As for the poutine, it really is a hit-and-miss, sometimes the fries are left in the open for too long and they absorb so much moisture from the air they're no longer crispy, and they become hard to eat.The chicken thighs and ribs were alright, very mediocre comfort food that are enjoyed by lots of seniors.
