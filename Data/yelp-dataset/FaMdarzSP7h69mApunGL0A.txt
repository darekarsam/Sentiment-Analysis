2	I found my way to this office when I took advantage of a Groupon offer for a deep cleaning. I've been back three times since so I can speak from at least some experience. No, Dr. Turner is not the most outgoing dentist I've ever had but neither is he rude or short. Kind of a strictly-business guy, and I guess that's not all bad. As for me, however, I've decided to find another dentist in Mesa where I feel like my business is at least valued. I'm sure Turner's a capable dentist, but visiting his office always leaves me cold.

Dr. Turner and his staff seem to take pride in, and love what they do.  This was my third appointment and I don't go in with thoughts of having to see "the dreaded dentist" before I go in...that says a lot for me. :)
