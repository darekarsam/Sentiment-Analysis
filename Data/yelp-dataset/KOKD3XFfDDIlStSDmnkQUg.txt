1	Horrible.. Worst Starbucks I have been in a long time and it has been awhile. Names were not written. All three drinks made wrong and no apologies
1	HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!! Waited a half hour for my drink, the ten people in line behind me got theirs. I said what the F*ck??? Oh they were extremely rude to me and took their sweet time getting me a refund. Will NEVER go back. Rude employees. Slow horrible service.
1	Worst Starbucks I have ever been to. Waited for just under 30 minutes for an iced chai. People that came after me got their drink way before I did. I had to remind the barista about my drink 3 times and then they tell me that there is not even an order put in for an iced chai, so then I had to go talk to the cashier about my order. 27 minutes later, I get my iced chai. I am NEVER going back to that location. I had a simple drink and it took that long, imagine if I had a complicated drink, I probably would have waited an hour. Worst part is that it was not only me having a bad experience there. All the people waiting for their drink all said that this Starbucks was the worst ever.
