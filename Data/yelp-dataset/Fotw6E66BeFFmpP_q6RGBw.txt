5	Great prices!! Love it!  You have to sift through a lot of stuff but it is worth the money you save!
3	Store review:Somehow I have never been to Gordmans until now even though I have lived in IL. This is like a combination of marshall's with kohls. You have a large selection of clothes which are not name brand second season like tj maxx or marshall's which would have been a plus, but you do have the knick nack section like TJ maxx home goods from toys to pet items. Overall prices are okay, I did notice some 70-80% off yellow ticket items scattered around. The quality of the goods are so so, but this is another location to shop at and look for good items to buy.Pros: some good yellow ticket sales, variety of goodsCons: no name brand clothesHidden deals:Check your receipt for a 20% off coupon after survey on one item
5	I used to shop here all the time as a teenager, always found great stuff! I still shop here when I come to town to visit family. Great Labor Day sales. 50% off all clearances made amazing deals! My husband found so many things as well as my sister. Today I found jeans that are perfect for females 5'4" and under, I'm 5'4" and most jeans are insanely long on me but the ones I found are perfect! Love the store! They could so without a few rude employees. There's an older woman that works the front she always has such a negative attitude. But still I'll give this store 5 stars
5	I will come here for discounted perfume. some fun lingerie and guy clothes. They have some fun home decor too.
