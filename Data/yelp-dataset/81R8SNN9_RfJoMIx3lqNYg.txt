2	I came to the Blumenthal Cancer Center after Dr. Higgins was highly recommended.  I have had a less than stellar experience.  He's a gynecological oncologist.  I had a biopsy done a month ago & no one from Dr. Higgins office bothered to call with the results.  I'm waiting to find out of my pre-cancerous cells have become cancerous and no one will return my calls!  Finally after 2 1/2 weeks a nurse from another Dr in the Center returned my call & read my chart and said I may need surgery.  A week or two goes by, no one from Dr Higgins returns my call about my results or impending surgery.  I finally got a call back to schedule surgery and it's a day before my surgery and I still don't have pre-op instructions.  Still waiting on more phone calls to be returned.  I have yet to talk to Dr Higgins or his nurse about my results.  After all the stress of just dealing with Dr Higgin's office, he's very conservative in his approach.  He scheduled a colpscopy and then when I came in for my procedure, after paying $40 co pay he says, without even examining me, that he didn't think I needed a colposcopy despite a bad pap he wouldn't check.  Now a year later I have high grade pre-cancerous cells that have been unchecked for a year.  After this current surgery I'm finding another gynecological oncologist.
