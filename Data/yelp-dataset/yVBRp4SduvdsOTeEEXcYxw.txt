5	Kevin is a small owner operated business.  I have had several emergencies with my business computer for the last couple of years. Each time I desperately needed help, Kevin responded and arrived onsite within hours, sometimes within minutes! His prices are more than reasonable, he is very professional and kind.
5	Great Experience , nice guy!   Kevin fixed my virus ridden computer in less than an hour!!and without charging me an incredible amount.  In fact, I paid less then 1/2 of what Data Doctorswas going to charge me, and they wanted to keep it for 24 hours....best thing I did was RUNout of Data Doctors on Hayden & Indian Bend.  Call Kevin,  he's mature, professional and you won't have to be without your computer for very long!... KC in Scottsdale.
