4	I've recently become obsessed with the Kate Spade brand.  Expensiiiive, but you're paying for the name, quality, etc.The shop itself is pretty small; however, they pack a lot into this little space.  They feature handbags, wallets, jewelry, shoes, phone cases, & more.  Everything is neatly displayed, although you may have to search / dig around for the price(s).The employees, while busy, acknowledged everyone & made comments are item(s) they were looking at.  While I like that at times, I don't need to be complimented on every item that catches my eye. Unfortunately, this high-end brand doesn't have many specials / coupons / mark downs in the store.
5	I LOVE Kate Spade. LOVE. I've been a fan since I saw my first bag in New York City over 12 years ago. The employees in this store are always friendly. They do a good job of letting you browse without bothering you yet they magically appear if you need to ask a question or see a shoe in your size. The bright colors and design of the store are wonderful.
5	The staff is very friendly--Jacquelyn was especially helpful. I had a situation and she resolved everything with a smile. I will definitely be returning to this location!
