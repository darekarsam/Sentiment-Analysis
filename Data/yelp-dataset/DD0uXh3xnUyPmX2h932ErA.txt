5	Forget the second hand charity bookshops you may know, this charity bookshop has set a new standard.  It not only has a good variety and selection of books but also (for once) has a very good stacking and arrangement system making it easy to browse around. The prices are at a minimum and the quality of the books is good. I also really the wooden floors and layout which give it a very warm atmosphere. The people who work there are always super chatty and lovely and don't mind at all for your browsing as long as you like. Their stock is constantly renewed too.For those who don't know Barnardos is a charity focused completely on children of any background and supports them to succeed their full potential and dreams as well as campaigning for children's rights. So good books and a good cause what more do you want ?
4	Barnardos Books is more than just a charity shop - it's also a high quality second hand book stockist.On the same par as Oxfam books, this book shop is stacked high with stock of all varieties. You could find anything in here, from unearthing an old Disney kids book from the 70s or discovering some unusual fiction that's affordable enough to explore. Well ordered, cheap and with books in great condition, this is a thoroughly reputable book seller as well as representing a great charity.
4	A good little bookshop. Usually populated with what I like to call "Dead Books". When your Uncle Rodger pops the bucket, his life long book collection ends up here. The longer they lived, the better selection of books they aquire.Although i'm glad the person who bought all the Romantic Fiction kicked the bucket...
