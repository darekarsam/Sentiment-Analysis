4	Hands down my favorite smokeshop.They have a large variety and selection of glass, tobacco and detox products, grinders, scales, blunts, papers, hookahs, incense, cigars, handpipes, vaporizers and more. Most the staff is pretty cool, GREAT PRODUCTS AND PRICES!
1	This shop sucks. Bought a $35.00 lighter, within one hour realized it was broken tried to exchange it and they refused telling me I had a attitude problem.
5	absolutely WONDERFUL smoke shop...with best prices. VERY CORDIAL OWNER...He was receptive to the needs of two ladies who needed help...and gave a donation to get them to a safe place....wonderful!!!
