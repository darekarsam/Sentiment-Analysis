5	We have been using Joe's services for 5+ years and have always had great service.  We are on a bi-wkly schedule and our yard has never looked better.  Their prices are very reasonable and they have discounts available if you qualify.  Joe is very personable and will go out of his way to make sure you are completely satisfied.  My next door neighbors originally started using them for just the pre-emergent (to keep weeds from popping up), and now they are on a bi-wkly schedule also.  Even if you just have them come twice a year to do the pre-emergent, it's a LOT cheaper than paying the fines the HOA charges...lol!!  ;-)
5	Joe Moran and his Gold Canyon Landscaping crew are the most reliable, punctual, professional, and personable landscapers anyone can find in the Valley! Joe is quite creative at yard design, and he offers his services at affordable pricing. My husband and I are extremely pleased with our yard make-over and would be the first to put a sign in our yard advertising GOLD CANYON LANDSCAPING if this were allowed!
5	WOW!  Thanks to Joe Moran and his crew with Gold Canyon Landscaping I can see my house again!  Joe removed one overgrown tree and trimmed the other one up great.  They are prompt, professional and very affordable.  Give them a call for a quote today, they do excellent work!
