3	I think that I just stepped foot into Austin, Texas.  There are cowboy hats, belt buckles, and boots galore.  I have heard from some of my Texas friends that it is really hard to find cowboy gear in the bible belt.  This place has felt hats ranging from about fifty bucks to about five hundred if you are a really ballin' cowboy.  All of the employees were southern gents, but I just couldn't find a hat to fit on this big head.
4	My bride and I searched High and Low, to and fro for a flippin back scratcher, and of all the places we expected to find one, we didn't... of the places I expected NOT to find one, I did!  SCORE!  The mrs is happy, and you know what that means - everybody's happy!
4	Ridiculously seamless (no pun intended), from my quick fitting at the SoHo showroom to my first exquisitely crafted shirt arriving at my Toronto doorstep about two weeks later, these guys have it right. Cut, cloth and craftsmanship easily on par with Torricelli, Phineas Cole and the like, at literally fraction of the the cost...
