1	Do you guys normally deliver dead flowers?  A relative of mine sent someone in my family flowers from here, and another flower shop in midwest- almost identical arrangements-- yes roses in tubes, and green plant.  Having worked in a flower shop, I have some experience with roses- Relative in Charlotte took picture of her arrangement from this place and I took picture of mine, -- her roses were dead hours after arrival-- and pretty blown open to begin with.  This was a sympathy gift, and this flower shop should of refunded the buyers money, or offered a gift card- but instead the gentleman did nothing, and said "it wasn't his fault".  Thats a crock of BS.  Super funny, my roses from other flower shop in midwest look great today and roses are in tubes.  They were not blown open and old roses.  The owner/gentleman manager needed to fix this, as it was a sympathy gift, there is 10 million things he could of done to make this right.  He deserves more bad yelps.  Boo....
5	The arrangement was with many different flowers nicely coordinated color wise and PERFECTLY fresh which is so important. Fashion Flowers is a premium shop, the best in Charlotte.
1	Horrible, horrible, horrible! Unbelievable what they sell to customers! They sell bouquets 10x what other local florist charge. Action 9 news should do a report on local florists so the average customer knows what a bouquet should cost! Whole Foods makes lovely bouquets at a fraction of the cost. Don't waste your time or money here!
