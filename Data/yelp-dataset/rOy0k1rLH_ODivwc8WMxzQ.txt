2	West Elm opened in our neighborhood over the summer and I have been by  the store a few times. They have some nice stuff, a little cafe right in the store and their prices are pretty much what you'd expect from a place like this (i.e. nothing is a steal). One thing that is particularly annoying is that much of which is on the company's website is not available in their store. I don't mean that they don't have it in the store, which would be understandable, but it seems that you cannot even special order it. We were looking at carpets and were repeatedly told that styles that we liked were not available and even when the style was available they often were not able to order us the size that we wanted, even though it was displayed on their website. I know that the company is just starting to come to Canada, but I think that they should get themselves a bit better organized. I know that you can't carry 100% of your stock in all your stores, but customers should be able to special order items that are displayed online but not carried in the store.
1	such a shame, this place has great furniture and decorative items  -albeit at times overpriced - but man does their customer service SUCK.
