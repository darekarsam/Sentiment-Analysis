4	This was my first time working with The Maids. They're very nice and work fast. Their work is great! I'd recommend their services if you need a big job done quickly & correct. They're a little pricey but, depending on what you need, is worth it.
5	We hired them to clean my elderly parents home. They were resistant to have strangers come in. The crew were very nice to them and my folks were thrilled by the results.
5	Fabulous job!  I've never had my house cleaned by someone else before and was extremely pleased.  They arrived in the expected window and worked from the moment they entered the house.  Everything was left spotless!
