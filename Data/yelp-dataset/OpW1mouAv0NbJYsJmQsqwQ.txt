5	Tarot cards, crystals and books on every metaphysical topic you can imagine. And several more that you couldn't, wouldn't or shouldn't.  But somebody did anyway!  While I was browsing they were talking about Qigong breathing, Chi energy and Bruce Lee's one inch punch.  One glass of purple cool-aid?  Yes please!
5	Cute little shop!  Friendly staff who is very helpful.  Great place for Massage Therapist to get stones, books, music, etc.  I will be back very soon!
