5	so i did my research and called around town, this company was actually the first to pop up on google but no one was able to beat their price plus theyre able to do it same day! the tech came in within the scheduled time, very professional and finished in less than an hour-- sooo worth it, better than my fiance losing his weekend trying to repair it!
5	Good Services, Good quality, Good Price
5	I highly recommend this company for any of your garage door needs. They are so prompt,  professional,  competent and great prices.I've used them several times and referred them to others that are happy with their service as well.These days it's so rare to find a company with such overall quality as Vantage. I'm so pleased I found them. You will be too.Kit - Kat
