5	How can I not give my community clubhouse 5 stars?A couple of pools, hot tubs, basketball, fitness center, party room... and it's all included in my HOA?! Score!
4	In 2010, my realtor brought me to this clubhouse and showed me the place, enticing me to get a house in Yellowstone. The place was awesome. it has a pool, fitness center, room for private functions/parties. the houses are also nice and the floor plans are really great. the hoa is a bit expensive compared to the other places at mountain's edge, but its all worth it, with what u are getting.
1	So disappointed!! Weve loved this clubhouse.....until today. Beautiful saturday morning and we decided to take our 3 kids to play basketball. We show up just to find the court and the kids playground gates padlocked. Not sure what my dues are paying for if we cant use the facilities with our kids at 10 am on a saturday.
