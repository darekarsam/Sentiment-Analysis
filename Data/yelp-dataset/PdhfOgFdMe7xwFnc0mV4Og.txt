5	Reliable, fast and friendly- that's what University pedicabs is all about! Aside from the fact that owner, Tony, is a solid dude, he's got an awesome team of pedicab drivers. They're readily available on fourth avenue, university and downtown. The best part? They accept debit cards! Beats taking a cab and having to make a pit stop at the ATM, all while the meter is ticking.  Plus, University  pedicabs is Eco friendly and electric. And they have a free mobile app!
5	We took 2 pedi-cab rides through winterhaven with 2 of us in each cab for a double date. It was a great way to experience the winter season in the nice crisp open air with an up front view of the beautiful light displays.We had a wonderful time!
5	This is an awesome way to see all the lights. Very comfortable and many people walking or stuck in the traffic driving commented on that is the way to do it. Our Pedicab driver also knew all the best spots. John
