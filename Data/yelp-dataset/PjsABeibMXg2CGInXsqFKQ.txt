3	It's food-court food.  Apparently some of them are chains (Subway, Quiznos, Basha, etc.)  The souvlaki I had was good, but then again, I've never had it.  Wish they had lamb.
3	The Yero's at Kojax remind me more of the donair sandwiches from Halifax (don't crucify me for saying that) - but with the sweet garlic sauce, and the super compressed yero meat, it's a close comparassion that the city can offer. When I think of Kojax - two things come to my mind. Their great garlic sauce, and their wedge fries. Kojax doesn't serve you normal fries, Instead to get these 1/2 inch fries that are nice and crispy. Overall Kojax is a great fast food restaurant.
2	Just had the gyro combo here. This is not Kronos (my favorite), that is for sure. The taste of the gyro was somewhat bland, as well as the taste of the fries (though they are steak fries, which is plus). Not too much of a garlic flavor, and the sauce tasted more like straight up yogurt. Would I eat here if I specifically wanted a gyro? Maybe, but there seems to be other options in the food court.
