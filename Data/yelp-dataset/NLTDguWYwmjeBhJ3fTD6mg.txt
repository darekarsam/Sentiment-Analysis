5	Family owned and operated is the way to go. They treat you real and do not upsell just to make a buck. I have bought chlorine, a floater, thermometer and some PH chemicals from them. No hard sell or pressure just honest requirements. They also repair equipment and test water in addition to owning a pool cleaning service. Check em out.
5	very nice store, they have everything u neednice people to do Business with.
5	Well almost a year and they are still there. They must be doing something right. If you go to Leslies, or Paddock or Walmart for your pool supplies. STOP I found that the products at Bobbi's are superior to Walmarts and the staff is so much better then Paddock and Leslies. Seriously. I am on my 3rd bucket of chlorine and my 2nd floater. They always help me when the water gets a little cloudy and I don't know why, with out selling me a ton of stuff I do not need.
5	Very nice store. Employees are very helpful.
