3	Large space. Would be great for a party. Pizza very reminiscent of Village Inn pizza-thin crunchy crust with nice amount of cheese and Italian sausage to make it chewy, tasty and filling. Gourmet pizza it is not. It was a Thursday night so I didn't expect a crowd, but I wasn't sure our waiter was on his A game. I hope they are able to fill the place up on weekends.
5	Very good food! I work in Lincoln Square Mall and it's nice to see good places to eat or shop at joing the Lincoln Square Mall, I have lunch there often and the pizza is great! The Chorizo stuffed Mushrooms are to die for! The space is large so it would be a fun place to host a get together at. I would recommend their pizza to anyone!
