1	Regarding the Walgreen's Take Care Clinic:I went in for chest congestion/pain associated with a cold and nasal congestion and the APN almost would not examine me because she said it sounded like it was associated the heart and she would need to refer me to the ER or Urgent Care.  I assured her this was a normal feeling to have when I have a cold/chest congestion.  She said my chest sounded fine and to wait out my cold (had already been sick for 10 days and it was only getting worse).  Then she it took her a half hour to enter information in the computer and she said it was due to having to rule out a heart condition.
5	This is a nice Walgreens easy access since the parking lot  connects to the other stores all the way from Van Buren to I-10
3	Just your typical, untrained, understaffed, Walgreen. Just went there to pickup a couple of things. Had to asked three employees if they had it. then it took almost twenty minutes to check out. At least they had what I was looking for!
4	I love Walgreens!  This one is ok. The pharmacist is funny. He jokes around with my Adobe everything we go.  They are nice but the store seems a little dirty.  The one cashier up front wouldn't stop talking to us about her 1D lovin daughter. Lol
