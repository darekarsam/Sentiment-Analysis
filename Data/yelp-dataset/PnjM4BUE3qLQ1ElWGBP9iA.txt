5	You guys rock! Thanks again for another successful transaction. This is the best Real Estate team we have ever worked with and they are excellent from listing to closing. Thanks for helping with the entire process and making our purchase a reality. Looking forward to the next one!
5	The Picarello real estate team are truely outstanding!  My wife and I moved from California to Arizona.  My wife came out to Arizona on limited time to find a home since her new job which was starting shortly.   Kari and Karen lined up several properties on very short notice and gave her their full attention which ended in a successful real estate purchase.  Way to go team Picarello!!  I highly recommend Picarello real estate for your transactional needs.
