5	Great prices and they have about everything you need!! I go and go again!!! Cannot recommend this shop enough. Go here before you go anywhere because chances are, they have what you are looking for at a way better price.
2	Not a bad selection of items, there are only stairs no wheelchair access - however watch out, there is a short and stout Hispanic woman most likely 30+ who is definitely a bitch if you don't speak French with her, so please watch out for her attitude, it will ruin your experience :(
