4	Great place to grab a quick and cheap bite to eat. If you are in fort mill give this place a try!!
4	i love sub station! much better than sub way! I like that they slice you meats fresh. its not pre measured out. the quality of the meat is better. they have such an array of sandwich choices. This particular store sells meat by the pound.you can get a 3ft sub with 3 meats and 3 toppings for around $40 and a 6ft same way around $75. that would feed  lot of people! the place is really clean, serve yourself beverages. and the staff was very nice!
3	Bread is great but not enough meat on the subs. Buts it's also owned by different people then the one near uptown Charlotte.
