1	If you want forever in the drive thru and be forgotten about the come here. The whole two lane thing isn't working here. I won't be back.
1	Can I give this place no stars for no service!!  Pull into drive through and it's extremely slow as usual.  The guy comes on the speaker and says "I'll be right with you".  Nearly 5 minutes later a truck pulls into the other lane and is immediately helped.  REALLY!!  Do they think I'm sitting here for my health?  I leave and go to McDonalds, never a problem there Every time I go here it's something stupid like this.  This isn't the first time I've left without service it is however the last time I will try.  This place needs a manager with a brain.
