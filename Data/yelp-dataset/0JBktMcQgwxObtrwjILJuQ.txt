2	Typical Pizza Hut pizza, greasy with average toppings. Wish they would come back with the lasagna, and their bone-out wings are OK, usually dried out. I only go here in a desperate pinch, when I don't want to wait for Papa Johns to deliver. Delivery guys are kind of snooty.
5	I was really impressed with their customer service.  They totally messed up my order and were so wonderful about it.  This was the first time ever for a mistake with them.  We order from here all of the time. They made my order again at no charge! They really know how to make things right.! Thank you Pizza Hut for your fabulous service!
4	It's a typical pizza hut except they have superb customer service. I've had my order messed up a couple of times where I shouldn't have waited (because I order online) and they've comp'd me pizza, drinks, and other stuff because of it. I appreciate the effort they put in to make sure everyone is happy.
