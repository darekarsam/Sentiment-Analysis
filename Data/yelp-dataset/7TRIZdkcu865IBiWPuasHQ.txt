2	I have to say I was super excited about a Golfsmith opening a store in Summerlin.  I frequented Golfsmith in Woodland Hills CA quite often and am a recovering golf hoe.  I was truly afraid of how much damage this place would inflict on my bank account.  Unfortunately, I don't think Golfsmith will have to be concerned about my problem.  I've been to the store 5-6 times and the experience has been relatively consistent but in a negative way.  The sales people seem like nice guys but will only bust their ass if the perspective customer look the part.  Maybe its my problem for not looking the part lol but they should try to be helpful to everyone.  I understand if its a crazy busy day and they have to customer profile, but it was dead and they prefer to putt around than help potential customers.At the end of the day, I am more saddened that I have to write this review because I was really looking forward to pitching in and do my part to ensure  downtown summerlin and its tenants get off to a solid start.  But I can't in good conscience spend money at a place where laziness is kinda apparent.

1	This is a racial & gender discriminatory store; if you are not a white male you may not be served the same.  They won't greet you or serve you.  Tried it three times.  Never failed on their ignorant policy!!  Three times a charm!  You are out of my shopping destination as a whole.  Won't give you business from now on!
