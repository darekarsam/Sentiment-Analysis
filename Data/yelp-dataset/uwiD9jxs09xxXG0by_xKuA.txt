3	Grabbed a couple of dozen bagels and took to work.  Man they don't last long.  Bagels are good and the service is friendly.  They were real busy but make time to chat will working.
4	I love this Bruegger's! It's like the others in the chain so you probably either like their food or you don't. (But who doesn't like bagels?) But I find this particular Bruegger's to be exceptional. The staff is always kind and attentive, and I'm in love with their tomato caprese bagel sandwich. They're convenient and delicious - what more can I say or ask for?
3	I have been to this place many many times over the years. But the last visit was at least a year prior. I was shocked by the outside condition of the restaurant. This place definitely looks like it's falling apart on the outside. I didn't stay there to eat, but from what little that I  saw, the inside looked fine. My toasted bagel with cream cheese was okay, but there wasn't a napkin in the bag. Seems like a silly oversight.
3	Food is what you would expect from a BB, staff is friendly enough but the prices are outrageous.  My boyfriend and I had to endure the drive thru because we were running late for our camping trip. My "toasted" bagel was white and soft... before the addition of cream cheese. Prices are crazy! Don't be so lazy... drive down the hill to the GE... buy a 6 pack of bagels, cheese and some bacon for under 10 bucks!  You'll have left over food and cash
2	Received bad service today.  Got the wrong chase for my sandwich,  Got decaf tea instead of regular tea even though he was told black tea.  Usually you have to ask for decaf. However, lots of seats since the place was empty.  We left Einstein's because it was  crowded.They Missed an opportunity to impress a new customer.  Guess it's back to Einstein's.
