3	This is my go-to Indian store when I'm in need of something quick for my weekday meal.  They have a decent variety of Indian staples.  Their produce is mostly OK, and I tend not to buy anything fresh there.  I notice that it goes bad quickly.  Although their cilantro, and spinach seem to be a safe bet.  You can find most things here, but I still prefer to shop at Patel brothers.  They do have an Indian buffet, priced per lb.  The food is from Indian Garden on Atwood Street.  This def doesn't look appetizing to me (mostly because it's Indian Garden's food), but I've seen many people swing by just to pick up to-go food.
4	This place is really great for produce - whenever I shop here, I've noticed consistently lower prices than the supermarkets in the area. I agree with the reviewer who noted that the produce sometimes expires pretty quickly (perhaps that's why it is so cheap?), so I tend to purchase small amounts of items like peppers and tomatoes that I plan to use that night or the day after. They also have decently priced spices. A hidden (?) benefit is their relatively cheap oils. If you are Black with natural hair (or someone of any race who uses/makes primarily natural hair products) you can find staple oils like coconut, castor and vatika oil for great prices compared to online and at many specialty retailers. After produce, that's the primary reason I go there. I've never tried their lunch buffet, but India Garden is decent, so the lunch is probably decent as well.
4	They have really cleaned this place up since it opened. It seems to have most Indian staples to make a good meal. I'm weary of the frozen entrees a they seem older and taste older than other frozen food. I love the India garden buffet food. And usually on Saturdays you get a free meal when you spend $35.
