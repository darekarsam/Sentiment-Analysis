3	I wish it were sans soucy. It was more like avec souci for us. See what I did there.No one thing was that bad... it was a lot of little things. We thought there would be free parking, but that was only if you could find it on the street. We thought there would be a jacuzzi bathtub, but that was only if you brought your own air compressor.  And drain plug.The bed wasn't super comfortable. The breakfast was fine (croissant and an omelet)... nothing life-changing.However, you cannot beat the location. And it is a charming building. So, not a total bust, but I don't think I would stay again.
4	Stayed here in the winter, and found it very pleasant overall. It was a beautiful, charming building in an equally beautiful and charming area. The room was a good size, looked out onto the street (which wasn't terribly loud), and was very comfortable.  The free Wi-Fi was really nice, and helped us not use data while we were roaming.The breakfast was good, and it was nice to talk to other travelers while eating. I do wish that the breakfast was a bit larger, or you could eat more than one croissant, but it wasn't too big of an issue. The staff was very helpful and gave us directions when needed. They did seem to act a bit coldly towards us, but I am not sure if it was because we were young and they thought we were stupid, or they were being a tad snobby. It would have been nice to have been welcomed more warmly, and it only slightly dampened the charm of the place. If you like boutique hotels, this is a gem. It is on a street full of art galleries, and a walk away from many restaurants and bars. Would go again.
