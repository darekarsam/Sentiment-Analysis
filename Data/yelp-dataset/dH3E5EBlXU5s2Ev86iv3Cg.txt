3	I think the consistency in size at Abercrombie is a problem. The service at this location is better than most I have ever seen at an Abercrombie. I have had no problems with returns or exchanges, which happens sometimes when ordering online. I love how the whole store smell of cologne. It's cold in that store. I remember feeling too cold to shop - well almost. They have sales and coupons a lot! That makes me happy.
4	My husband got me a dress here and it was super cute, but too short. There was also a long string near the waist that I noticed, but did not pay much attention too. I went to Paradise Valley to return it (tags on with receipt) and they said there was a  missing belt. I let them know it did not have a belt when he got it,but they would not take it back.  So I went to Fashion Square where he got it, explained the situation and they happily took it back and credited my card, not just a store credit.Thanks!
1	The music is WAY to loud. You can't even hear yourself think much less talk. No selection of sizes. Clothing is cheaply made and overpriced.
