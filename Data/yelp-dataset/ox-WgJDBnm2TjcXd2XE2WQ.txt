2	31 Flavors, 5 (or so) tables, 4 loud teenagers, 3 other ice cream choices within,2 blocks.1 customer who probably won't be back.
3	Despite the proliferation of such places as Ben & Jerry's and Coldstone Creamery, there's still a place for the good old basics.  And to me, there's nothing as yummy as good old fashioned chocolate ice cream.  And as a diabetic who loves ice cream, I've become alarmed at the gigantic portions places like this are now offering up.  Even a cone adds unwanted carbs, so I'm glad I can still get a single scoop of chocolatey goodness in a cup.
3	The cashier didn't seem all to thrilled to serve me my ice cream and for that I have to take away too stars. It's Baskin Robbins if you've had ice cream at one then you've had ice cream at all of them. I think next time I'll just eat the Ben and Jerrys I have in my freezer.
3	Aw crud!  Closed now!
