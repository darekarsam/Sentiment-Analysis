5	Integrity, Knowledgeable and skilled. No matter what you may need in or around your home, this Kurt and his company teamed with a network of industry specific professionals will be able to care for your needs.
5	Top notch service!  If you seek quality and friendly service then Handyman Xtreme is your team!  They helped me with a small repair (fan) in my house but rolled out the red carpet as if I was their most important client.  I try to support local small businesses when I can.  I highly recommend these guys!
5	This was the 1st time using Handyman Xtreme and it won't be the last! Tom, was very  professional and courteous. He installed and reassembled my ceiling fan, and dining room table with efficiency.Excellent Service!
