5	The building is beautiful.  All the rooms are private and newly remodeled. The staff is very friendly and attentive. It is strictly a short term facility for people to go to after the hospital and before they go home. My Aunt stayed there and she was very happy with her stay. She had a private suite with private shower and sitting area.  She was able to bring her dogs to visit (as long as she had proof of vaccines).  I would recommend this facility to any friends and family.
5	I am so impressed with the compassionate and professional care at this facility. Everyone from the folks that deliver food, the occupational and physical therapists, nurses, aides, Dr. Prabhakaran...the entire staff are so kind and caring. I highly recommend this facility to anyone who is in need of care!
1	This rehab center is so poor I am amazed they can stay open. Poorly staffed , doctors and nurses are not available when you need them. No one was around when my husband was in need of medical attention. Once a doctor on call was paged and after 4 hours he never called back and my husband complaining of intense stomach pain had to be taken to the hospital. Patients be ware one of several horrible times.
