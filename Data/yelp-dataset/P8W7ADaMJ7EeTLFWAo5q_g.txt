4	Very friendly front desk team, the facilities themselves are well maintained and clean. I have a small 5x5 unit which is indoors and it is always kept cool which I like because I didn't want my stuff to be left in 100 degree heat. Their prices are some of the lowest in town but they do include a mandatory insurance plan which will cost you an extra $9/mo. I wasn't told about this until I signed my agreement.
3	Friendly staff. Clean facility. Not too happy that rent was raised for no reason other than I had been there for 5 months.
1	Let me start off by saying that my Grandmother, mother, and my self have had units at this location for over 10yrs. We always pay on time if not not early. Always got along very well with the staff.NEVER had issues. Recently this location hired a new manager ( which I swear has horns) and she is just absolutely horrific! First the unit price went up, now the dumpster is locked up and can no longer be used by customers. But the absolute worst thing about her is her terrible additude! She's rude, snobbish, and because of HER and only HER I can't help but to leave this location after all these years. On top of that, it will not be at another Extra Space location. Thanks crazy new manager on W. Sahara! Not recommended.
