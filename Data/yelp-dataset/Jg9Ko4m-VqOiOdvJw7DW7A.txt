4	Gourmand Vagabond Food truck can be best described as fusion sandwiches on wheels. They just do 3 kinda Sandwiches. Roast beef, Chicken Vindaloo & Ham sandwich. The ingredients are fresh and the sandwiches taste yummm, my favorite being the Chicken Vindaloo sandwich.  Just one thing, even though its called vindaloo, it has nothing to do with the actual Indian vindaloo dish.  Nevertheless its tasty. Sandwiches are 9 bucks each (including taxes) and you can get a salad and a beverage (gazpacho, strawberry juice) for 14 bucks. The take cards too.Food : GoodService :FastAmbiance : It's a Food TruckWorth the price : Yes
4	Had the roast beef, cheddar, onion, and spinach sandwich, and it was very good. Wanted some more meat though. Strawberry juice on the side was an excellent touch and a great value at $3 (tx. in.). Recommended. And they take credit cards.
