5	I was in Montreal for a week and a half.... My only regret is that we found La Dora the last three days here (best three meals we had).Three of us were in Montreal on business - following the Yelp reviews.  After a week of "fails", we decided to give La Dora a shot (risky move for this Yelp aficionado).Highly recommend the pork chop.... Almost all the veal dishes are a age betas well.The prices are very fair, the wine selection good and the service excellent.This is a great Italian  Restaurant that still has that family feel.Enjoy !
5	They do it right here.  You'll think you're in Italy.  The food amazing.  The  place is immaculate and the service impeccable at this family run establishment on the east end.  I had the spaghetti bolognese, my boyfriend had the pasta sampler.  A bottle of Pino Gregio, and a couple lemocellos after dinner.  Perfect.
5	I have eaten at La dora twice and I have to say that both times were excellent!I had the veal with pasta and it was perfect.The age range is mostly people in their 50's- 60'sI have no negative comments.  I highly recommend it!
5	Cute little Italian place in Hochelaga Maisonneuve. Awesome service, good food, and to top it all off: cheap. I like it.Don't expect fancy, go here when you want a plate of non-pretentious food in a friendly atmosphere.
