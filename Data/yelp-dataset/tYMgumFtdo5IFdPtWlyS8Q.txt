5	What a gem of a find! This is a tiny, no-frills spot in a strip mall that you might pass by without a second glance. Then you smell the food grilling! The specialty is chicken covered in delectable Portuguese spices: Tender with a nice kick! My choice was served with a large green salad and fries enhanced with garlic. I also sampled the grilled Octopus, which was fresh and tender.  I already want to go back! The added bonus is that the most of the menu is Gluten Free - the owner and servers were great! However, this place gets 5 stars based on the food. :)
4	What a little piece of heaven! Went with a colleague for lunch, and thoroughly enjoyed it. We started with a couple of cod cakes - the cod and potato mixture was smooth, and they were beautifully fried. I then had a chorizo sandwich, which was nicely spiced (the server asked how spicy I wanted it, and it was delivered at just the right mild heat). At first the sandwich appears to have a disproportionate amount of meat to bun, but you soon realize that the sausage is so flavourful that more would be just too much. The accompanying fries were delicious - seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic. Side salad was fresh and the vinaigrette helped cut the heavier dish. My colleague had the chicken breast and said it was delicious.We finished off the meal with coffee (served with steamed milk on the side, a nice touch), and a nata. The nata is a custard filled tart,  sprinkled with cinnamon - so good that I picked up 6 to bring home.Resto was clean, food fresh and service was great - I will be back!
3	Had a good chicken sandwich with fries and an overly-oily salad for under $10+tax and tip. Server was really friendly and fun. Decent lunch, but I don't know that I will be rushing back.
