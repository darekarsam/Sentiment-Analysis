4	This is a Starbuck's located inside Von's. It is owned and managed by Von's.  Plenty of help and seats.  Very convenient for a caffeine boost  when I patronize this Von's or I am headed southeast.
4	An iced Cafe Mocha with an extra shot is the same in Topeka as it is here. This location gets 4 stars based on service. It's service that's fast and without attitude.
4	Starbucks is starbucks. I have always had great, quick, and friendly service at this location which inside the Vons on Horizon Ridge. It is located right by the door so I can quickly stop in and get a coffee even if I am not going in to shop. Keep up the good work!
5	Moving across the street and putting in a drive-through window was the best decision this Starbucks location ever made.  I love how convenient it is to get a great cup of coffee now.
4	Staff is kind. For a bunch of teenagers, I'm impressed.They made my drink efficiently, even though I'm sure I heard some gossip  about "being thrown under the bus" and "quitting or getting fired"..... But, not bad. I'll be visiting when I am in Vons.
5	I was a total klutz and spilled my drink all over the floor in the checkout of Vons. They were super kind and replaced it at no charge!
