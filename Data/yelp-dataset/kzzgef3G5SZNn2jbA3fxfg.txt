5	My daughter attended her high school prom and wore a gown with elaborate bead and crystal work on it.  We were very apprehensive about finding the correct dry cleaner.  We heard very good things about Viking and were told that they were especially good with high end garments.  We decided to try them and they definitely exceeded our expectations.  The staff was kind, caring and honest and definitely paid attention to detail.  The gown came out looking better than new.  Viking was truly wonderful.

1	Wash and WRINKLE!!!  I travel a lot and get clothes "washed and folded".  Paid $3.00/lb to get clothes washed and folded.  Clothes were washed but nothing was folded.  In fact, every shirt in the bag looked like it was thrown in and wrinkled.  Maybe their dry cleaning is good but their laundry service is the worst I've ever experienced.
