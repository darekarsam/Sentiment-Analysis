1	Horrid company...staff is completely unhelpful and their tactics are suspicious at best.Makes me mad just thinking about them.
1	Awful customer service, awful business ethics, overall terrible people. I hope they enjoy their existence of screwing people over.
1	To reiterate previous comments, my experience was awful.  Incompetency at its finest.A quick look at the Better Business Bureau website will show they have a boatload of unanswered complaints and are unaccredited.  Hope and Pray your car is not towed by these people.  They were not even on site to handle the situation and could not be more inept.
1	If this is the same United Towing that is currently on Newberry St., then these people need to be shut down. They are rude, unprofessional and are have some power trip going on. I had to call the police to get my car out because they wouldn't take my money. What should've been a quick and easy process, turned into a 2 1/2 hour ordeal (maybe longer). I was able to get some video of it and would love to post it somewhere. It's only about the last 10 minutes of it all but it clearly shows how they operate.
1	Zero stars shut them down they are police endorsed crooks.  the injustice of cops against all is real! STOP this abuse!!!!
