5	The awning still says, "JP's Cafe" but it's now just The Cafe and owned by the guys who brought us Cafe Du Jour. So that tells you it's excellent and I could stop right there, but let me go on and insist that The Cafe has the best breakfast in South Side. How do I know? Because I'm not getting up at the crack of dawn to make my own fruit-filled pancakes, so I've shopped around and this is where I spend my breakfast dollars. (It doesn't take many of them to fill up at The Cafe.) And because the delicious aroma of breakfast at The Cafe is what wakes me up every morning and gets me motivated to start the day. Stop in for one of Patty's big breakfasts. Try one of Dan's new wraps for lunch. And look for his entries in the yearly South Side Mid-Winter Soup Contests! You like soup!  And you'll love The Cafe.
4	Jp's is the best breakfast option on E. Carson. The food was tasty, cheap and the place is cozy, with 10 tables total.After being disgusted by O'leary's, we searched up and down E. Carson for breakfast places. We were lucky to find this place.
4	This place is cheap! You get a lot of food for your money and it's pretty good too.I didn't like the cheese they used on my omelette, but the home fries were awesome, and the bread they use for their toast is delicious.
