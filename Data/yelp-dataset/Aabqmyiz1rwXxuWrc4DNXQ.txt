5	I spent years receiving massages from different therapists before I found Jan.  Her intuitive touch is perfect and I haven't used anyone else since.  I feel amazing at the end of our sessions and she always gives me good advice on keeping me that way in between visits as well.  The fact that she cares so much about her clients makes her one of a kind.  You must give her a try!
5	I need to do this more often. I usually go every other month, but due to some obligations, I waited three months. Oh my goodness, I could feel it! I am still a little sore from the massage on Saturday, but in a good way. I feel SO MUCH BETTER when I do this regularly. Jan is amazing and I highly recommend her to anyone wanting a massage. The best part? She comes to your house! I love being able to walk into the other room and relax on the couch right after I'm done. She's truly amazing.
5	I am a hairstylist with wicked shoulder and arm pain. Jan is amazing at soothing my pain and working out allllll my nots. She might be little, but is stronger than any other therapist I have experienced. Jan rocks my socks!
5	I have been everywhere in Phoenix over the past ten years trying to find the best massage.  I am grateful the search has ended now that I found Jan.  I have terrible back and neck pain due to my job, Jan is the first therapist I've been to who takes my pain seriously.  She is always teaching me techniques to try at home to correct my bad posture and keeps notes so she knows what works and what doesn't to manage my pain.  Each session is always different and she combines stretching, deep tissue and relaxation massaging in each session.  I always feel like a new person after I see Jan and I feel so much less stressed.  If you want to feel better or need help managing your stress, I strongly suggest seeing Jan at Dwell Massage!
