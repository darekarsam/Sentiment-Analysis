5	Great place to look for those finishing touches when decorating. They have a great selection of upscale gently used and also new furnishings. Very reasonable prices and very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Also have licensed interior designers to help with your design needs.
1	My experience with Consign2Design was very disappointing to say the least.  I went in one day saw a wall clock I wanted but needed to measure my wall, the next morning I called and asked then to hold it for me since I couldn't get there till afternoon, she said they don't hold items (which I understand).  I said I wanted to buy it and she took my name, she did not ask for my credit card which I would gladly have given.  I didn't think to offer it, I drove quite a distance to the store in the afternoon and was told they had sold it.  This is not good customer service.
5	I love this place! Anytime I'm in Scottsdale, I have to stop here! You never know what beautiful items they have, since it's ever-changing! Next time I'm in the market for furniture this will be my first stop! Great prices, (of course the longer they have something, the lower the price) and great staff!
5	I love shopping here.... There are always great finds! The consignment process is easy & they keep great records of the customers inventory. The gals are so friendly and helpful,   The best consignment store I've been to in Scottsdale! I can't wait to shop again!!
