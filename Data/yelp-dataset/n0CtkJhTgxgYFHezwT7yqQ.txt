2	To many issues. Only used 3x's and each time had issues. The repsonse was "sorry we did not meet your expectations" Guess what, they set the expectations. Last cleaning the check list stated "special attention to bathroom floors" and one bathroom was not even vacuumed. I guess my idea of special attention is different than theirs. Could never get a response from the manager or owner. Very misleading on what is cleaned & not worth what they charge. The 1st two cleans are double the price for a detail clean but only 1 bathroom really got the detail clean. If you want someone to do a basic swiffer of floors & furniture thats what they do.
1	Terrible.  Workers are lazy and careless. Cathy only gives excuses for them.  Even had an issue getting my key returned when I canceled the service.
