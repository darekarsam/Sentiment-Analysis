4	Never busy inside, seems to do a good takeout business.The first few times we ate here the food was great, well seasoned, good portions, and fresh tasting.The last time we went the food seemed bland. The server asked us, and the table near us if the food was too spicy, so I can only assume they were getting complaints. It's a shame really, because the dishes were perfect before.
5	This was our first time here! They have a great dinner for two special for anyone who has never tried Thai food before! It was fantastic along with the Watermelon bubble tea! I would definitely return to try more food! A must try!
4	Decided to try this place since it is nearby and I had a craving for Thai food. Ordered pad thai and thai mango beef stir fry with rice and everything was cooked superb. The vegetables were very fresh and the portions were big. The meat was tender and the pad thai came with many succulent shrimps! Only thing I didn't like was that rice was not included with the stir fry but it was only $1.75 extra so not a big deal. Meal for two dishes was $24 not including tip. It is a nice looking restaurant inside and they have a variety bubble teas and desserts as well. Definitely a hidden gem in KW-you wouldn't expect a good restaurant in that area! They also have a dinner for 2 for around $27 with spring rolls, mango salad, pad thai and curry stir fry with rice which is what I'll be trying next time. And lunch specials run from $7.95
3	Update: Tried this place again for the Thai Spicy stir fry with hot and sour soup and was quite unimpressed. The thai spicy was made with a coconut sauce which is fine however it tasted TOO overly sweet, as if they added more sugar to the dish. I could not finish it. The hot and sour soup was also overly sweetened and more like a sweet and sour soup. Next time I order here I'll stick with the curry pad thai, pho or appetizers and NOT any of the sweet stir fried dishes
