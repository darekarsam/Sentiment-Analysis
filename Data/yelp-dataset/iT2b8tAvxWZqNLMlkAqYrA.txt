5	Colonel Sanders is a culinary genius!! All I know is that Kentucky Fried Chicken is the best tasting fried chicken in the world! Yes I said it, "The World". Eleven herbs and spices is the equivalent of crack for fried chicken lovers like myself. You can keep your extra crispy and grilled chicken. I am a loyal original recipe lover forever. "Finger lickin good" is the understatement of the century. Combine this chicken with mashed potatoes, the awesome gravy and coleslaw and you have a guaranteed five-star meal every time. Original recipe chicken breast with skin = 370 caloriesCalories from FAT = 190 NICEQuintuple bypass = $50,000.00 Having lunch with the Colonel...priceless!
