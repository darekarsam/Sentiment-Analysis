3	AEO is pretty standard. Some of the pieces can be pretty boring, admittedly. However, I've been shopping here for almost a decade now, and the tops fit me very well, so I see no reason to stop now! Love their basic tank tops, they're ribbed and slimming and hold their color well. I also have several pairs of leather sandles and sundresses that I love. All in all, a good place to go if you want to look cute, all-American and laid-back.
4	It's a Mall and it's a typical AE shop.  Service was great as I was greeted with a smile and asked by staff if I needed assistance.Always great clothing and they had plenty in my size.
