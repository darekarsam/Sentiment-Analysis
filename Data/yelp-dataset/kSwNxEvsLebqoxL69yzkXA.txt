3	I really like Dr Wysong- his nurse practitioner could use a little help on her bedside manner. But- they were able to get my son in quickly as a new patient, and the Doc was thorough, friendly and informative. So, I will be switching my family over.
1	Dr Bode is wonderful, HOWEVER...On my first visit, I waited over 2 hours past my scheduled appointment to get in. I thought that a morning appointment would work out better, but I'm currently 90 minutes past my appointment time and STILL waiting for Dr Johnson. This place really needs to figure out how to respect other people's time.
5	Been seeing Dr. Phillips for years. He is such an amazing doctor. Real easy to talk to and is not one to push meds as his only treatment.
2	Just left DVFP after being "treated" for an allergic reaction to a bee sting. They forgot about me in the waiting room! Then the doctor wouldn't even give me a steroid shot--he gave me a prescription!! This could have just been done over the phone. If they send me any type of bill I will NOT pay it. They should be ashamed.
