2	Nothing special. Very run down. I stopped to air up my tires. The air pump hose had a hole in it, which I did not realize until I had already paid of course. It was very raggedy as it was. I'm not even sure the pressure gauge accessory worked. At least they were able to break my twenty to give me a dollar in quarters. The girl at the counter was very nice too. We shared some laughs. It was nice. Thank her for the two star rating.
