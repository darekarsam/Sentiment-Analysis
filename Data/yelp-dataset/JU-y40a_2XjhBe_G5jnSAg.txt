4	A cold beer and tasty tacos at a reasonable price. The owner/manager was helpful and checked on us several times. For the money, one of the best meals I had on the trip.
2	The food was not amazing and we literally spent 30 minutes arguing with the manager about our bill.  The prices are listed differently on the menu, we ordered food from the menu (even pointed at specific drinks) but were surprised when the prices came back as double. They also added gratuity for 8 people where there were 6... Bad experience. BUT they have us all a shot of tequila at the end for the huge struggle.
2	This place has such an amazing location, except I ate here at night at the patio didn't even have gas for their heaters!! Sorry but it's 50 degrees at night, but why wouldn't I want to sit outside to see the beautiful city! The staff also didn't not help us find a table, they were sitting in the booths and asked what we were doing when we were walking to the patio to eat. She must have been the manager, she said she was so sorry when we told her we're going to eat on the patio. Finally the margaritas were a rip off! Literally 11$ for a small plastic water glass! I don't understand how this place is still in business when it doesn't attract anyone, the staff is rude!  The food was good though, but the staff ruined it for me.
