3	It was really good! :) The poutine was great and pretty fast service!! My only huge problem is that they don't take debit...I mean if you have enough money to pay rent on st-catherine for a restaurant..offer you clients a debit payment option, you will have so many more repeat clients! Wont be going back for that reason alone...Good place though!
1	I worked there. Believe me, you do not want to eat there. Hygiene? methinks not.
4	I know this place isn't the fanciest, or even the prettiest, but damn if i don't love their poutine.  I had several versions (smoked meat is the best variation) on more that one occasion.  I definitely ate more than i should have.  This particular location is also in a location that makes it quite convenient to stumble into after hitting the bars down the street.Would go back again should i find myself in the wonderful province of Quebec
4	It's not fancy at all and the workers seem like construction workers but they were nice and the food was good. This is a better la belle province location with Poutine that taste like Poutine.  I would return here and only this location if I want a belle province Poutine.
