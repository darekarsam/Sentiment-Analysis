5	I went here not expecting much and got a lot more than I bargained for you can tell they use good quality meat the service is great and the price is excellent I would definitely recommend people here best taco stand in town
4	Yum!  So glad I checked Yelp (yet again) when deciding where to eat tonight.  I've seen this taco truck several times on my way home but am always sketchy about which ones are good since there are so many!  The photos on the reviews were awesome and I saw that I could call to place a to-go order.  The woman who answered spoke very clear english and explained to me what a Huaraches was.  I'm glad I decided to try it.  SOOO tasty!  I got the carne asada one and a carne asada taco.  Everything was very fresh and delish.  I can't wait for the bf to get back in town to take him there.  They're going to be getting a lot of to go orders from me!  :)
5	I have to say that this place is the best in LAS VEGAS... F@#$ Tacos El Gordo and PEPEs tacos... Plus the customer service is a big plus here. I am from San Francisco and it has been hard finding a good taqueria.. Hands down on this place.. The tacos are made with hand made tortillas. I totally recommend this place. We go once a week. The owner and his wife are so sweet and remember their customers names. Great place to get a fast service.. Their champurrado is awesome..
4	They Do accept Credit Cards and Debit!!Would be 5 stars but $$$. 6/main item ie burrito, quesadilla, each dish etc.
5	The price is great, the customer service better, and the tacos OUT OF THIS WORLD!!  Handmade tortilla, and a tasty flavored asada.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants their taste buds to thank them.
5	Had tacos and a Buritto hear last night I must say bomb. I had pastor and a chicken burrito nice size had made tortillas. I went out of my comfort zone to try tripes it was so good I'm going to get some more tonight.
