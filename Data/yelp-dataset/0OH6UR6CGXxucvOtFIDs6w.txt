5	Dr. Ryan Larson is the best at getting your body back in place, and functioning quickly.  His specialty is sports medicine and really does a great job.  He also adjusted me clear through a few of my pregnancies.  Including the most recent twin pregnancy.  He's also helped my babies after their birthing experience.  He offers laser treatments and holistic options.  I've referred several people to him and no one has been disappointed.  All of my children have also been adjusted, they play hard and sometimes the wrestling can be too rough.  It clears up their headaches and sometimes their crankiness.  :)
5	I have to say that Dr. Ryan Larsen saved me while I was in AZ! I live in Sacramento, CA and was there for a long visit due to some family needs. I have a regular chiropractor in Sacramento, but I needed immediate help due to an injury I sustained while doing a workout in AZ. Dr. Larsen worked his skills and seriously helped me out. I appreciate the professional care he gave me in my home away from home. Within a very short time I was back to normal. Now I have a chiropractor in every port.
5	THE BEST OF THE BEST!!! Both Dr. Ryan Larson & Dr. Dave Shiflet have been treating our family for over 12 years! Their #1 priority is making you feel better! Whether your injury is old, new, or reoccurring, their adjustments get you back to normal. As an existing patient, I have never been denied coming in the same day, which is always appreciated. Most recently, my husband was involved in a car accident while working and Dr. Ryan Larson was SO incredibly knowledgeable on the worker's compensation process. He said his goal is "to treat" but guided us through the process so we knew what to expect and what to do next. He even went above and beyond to have the radiologist call his personal phone so we could get the CT results faster! I have referred many people over the years and they are patients for life!
