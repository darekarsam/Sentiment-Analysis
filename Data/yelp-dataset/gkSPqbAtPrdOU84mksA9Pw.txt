5	This ABC store is in the ghetto and I love it!  The clerk is an older black fellow and he is really fun to chat with.  I saw a Miles Davis frame on the wall and I made a comment about it and it went on from there.  We spoke about the South Carolina jazz festival coming up and the dedication they will be holding for Dizzy Gillespie, a South Carolina native.  He recommended some tasty vodka for me.  'Hey you know I have never had a conversation about jazz with a young white guy like yourself,' he said.  'Well you know one love man!'
3	I don't want to sound un-PC, but this ABC store isn't in the, uhh, greatest neighborhood, so be careful if you're headed here late at night or when it's dark out. Lots of unsavory characters hang around in here, and I've definitely seen some uncomfortable situations and confrontations go down there.With that said, great place to pick up any and alcohol you might need--and I do mean ANY alcohol. Their selection is tremendous. And the people who work there are really nice as well, which is a nice touch. Honestly, this place has whatever you need for your party, down to the mixers. Just be safe when you're headed here.
