2	The dinner salad with house dressing was tasty and large, the mixed baby greens tasted fresh, the plum tomatoes were perfectly ripe and removed of seeds. Plenty to share; I had most of it, which turned out to be a good thing since the meatball sub was marginal. While the meatball had good texture and size, it was tasteless and bland. The red sauce had a little sweetness that seemed lost without any other spice or herb. The fries that came with the sandwich were decent steak fries but was served with Hunt's ketchup. I liked the bread.Service was perfect, but then we were the only patrons (it was 11 am). The 2 people with me that had lasagna seemed to like it but the more we talked about it, the less impressed they were.I do not wish to bash the place, it was clean, cute and had everything you would want from an independent bar/restaurant. I would try it again, but it was not worth buying the groupon coupons that got us there to begin with.
