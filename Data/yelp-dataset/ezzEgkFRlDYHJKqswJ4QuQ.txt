1	********** $9.99 For A 14" Circle of Crap **********Nothing but ULTRA THIN cardboard.......The sauce is all, but non-existent.....and tastelessAlso....Tasteless cheese.....to boot.Domino's, Have No Fear ......I'll never be back.
1	If it had been possible to give zero stars, I would have.ordered their hand made pan pizza. Complete and utter rubbish.  Raw uncooked dough in the middle.  Bland, boring and pathetic toppings.VItos is close.  Momma Spinnys is close.  Why did I fall for the advert and believe Dominoes might, possibly, produce an edible pizza
5	I love this location, their deliveries are always super quick and the staff is very friendly and helpful. They have some great specials and the pizzas are great. I'm not sure what happened with these previous 2 reviews, but you get what you order. I've never had anything bad from here and I order all the time!If you're looking for good pizza, fast, this is your place. Pizza Hut takes FOREVER to deliver, and the local Papa Johns makes poor quality pizza.
5	They never disappoint !
4	Yo, Dominos pizza is the fuckin bomb
3	Great job always keeping us happy...WAY BETTER than Pizza Hut...always improving...thank you for your service!
5	These guys have been feeding me for three years.  I'm a para as the result of a motorcycle accident and when I get sick I just do not feel like cooking let alone getting out of bed.  My ABSOLUTE fav pizza is a Thin crust, white sauce with chicken and spinach.  Covered in the $5.99 deal too.I have tried Papas and a couple of other chains but no one beats this pizza and I keep coming back to Dominos.I watch my pizza through the tracker and my dog watches the front door.  Have never waited more than 20 mins for a delivery.  Thanks to all of you who make my life a little easier and yummier!BTW one time it was a bit overdone (like really) and they called me immediately after reading my rating on their site.  I was given credit for another one next time I ordered.  Now that is management with authority.
