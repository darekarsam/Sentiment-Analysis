5	We used Realty One Group for our short sale. Dawn Balani is our realtor and thanks to her kind and conscientious service we were able to close  our property in two months. Dawn always took our calls and gave us weekly updates on the status of the sale. She established a rapport with the bank negotiator by promptly sending all necessary documentation. Realty One Group has a winner in Dawn Balani.
5	This is the second time we have used Gloria Cabrera from this office for our home purchase. She is amazing. Such a go-getter when it comes to finding homes that met our criteria. Everything went amazingly smooth and in a timely manner. My family is now settled in our new home and we couldn't be more appreciative of everything Gloria did for us.
5	We have worked with Ron Branson now for about 3 years on both commercial and residential property purchases and sales. He facilitated the purchase of our company building as well as several residential properties. He has always been professional (which is a rarity in Las Vegas) with regardd to being on time and has always returned phone calls and emails in a timely manner. He has always been prepared for meetings and has truly listened to what our requirements have been at the time. He has tremendous experience and has advised us well for every purchase  and sale we have made. Additionally he is a thoughtful and attentive person to work with and does not take anything for granted. We would recommend him to anyone, especially if you've had experience with other "realtors" in Las Vegas. He is a gem.
