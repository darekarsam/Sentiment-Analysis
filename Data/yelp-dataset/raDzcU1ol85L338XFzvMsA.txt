5	Not being a coffee person, it is harder than most to get me to like a coffee shop. Fortunately for me this one is near home and happens to be the absolute BEST Second Cup there is.The staff at this location are hands down the most friendly and hardworking coffee shop staff I've seen and they also happen to work amazingly well as a team. You think the local Starbucks team look in-sync when they hit the rush? I bet you that this team has them beat and they'll be grinning ear to ear the whole time. Even when I sit to enjoy my tea and get my new downloading session underway, I can hear one of the counter guys talking to a little kid about how much milk they go through, and how he grew a whole foot in a year from how much milk he drank. Super sweeties who give the absolute best service despite being the only java option in the area. It is one of those places that reminds you that the service is what counts.
2	Is Second Cup about coffee?Hubby & I are on a walk tonight and we decide on our way home to detour to Second Cup on Sherbrooke for a "special" coffee. We walk in and we order, to then be told that it will be a 10 minute wait because they are cleaning the espresso machine. .....Um, really?! You are cleaning the coffee machine during open business hours?! We asked if the machine was actually off and they said yes. It would have taken more time for it to properly warm up too, because it is an espresso machine. We walked out. How many others walked out? 10 minutes to wait for a coffee to go (unless you wanted the drip stuff without milk), is preposterous!Additionally, their baked goods are usually not fresh but they'll be happy to sell you an old muffin from early in the morning that is crusty & dry at the end of the day for full price. Totally unimpressed and we left empty handed. That's the worst a business could do, I think.P.S. This proudly marks my 60th review! Woot! MORE TO COME AFTER I GET MARRIED on MAY 17th!!!
