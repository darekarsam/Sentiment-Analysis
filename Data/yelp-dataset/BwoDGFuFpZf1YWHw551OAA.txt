5	I can appreciate good popcorn. Here at Doc Popcorn, they know what they are doing. They were in Scottsdale Fashion Square, but have since moved to AZ Mills. The best part about this popcorn is it isn't greasy, I appreciate movie theater popcorn too but the greasy-ness if it always leaves me feeling a little sick. Not at Doc!! Full of flavor and half the calories. My favorite is the cheddar. So good, it's worth the orange fingers. They also do tins, bulk popcorn, a great gift. We sent them out for a work event to clients. So delicious and easy!
5	Awesome popcorn and great service. We stopped by this location for the 1st time on Saturday and we're very impressed with the popcorn options and the great service we received from the guy working. I asked him to seal the tin we purchased, and since my husband wanted to snack on the popcorn, he gave my husband a small cup of popcorn. It was very sweet!
2	My son wanted to try the Better Butter and I saw they had Chicago mix so I decided to try them both.Prices are not bad but they weren't very special in flavor, I wouldn't stop again.
