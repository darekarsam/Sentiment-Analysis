5	Accentrick Tint/Kenny came highly recommended and I was not let down one bit. Service was prompt and the estimation of when the car would be ready was spot on. He provided great recommendations based on years of experience and even waxed the FRS since we had dropped it off in pretty dirty shape. Not that he would always have time to do that but I was amazed at the customer service. Kenny charged us the original quoted price even though he used a higher quality tint than we had requested and overall I would say Accentrick Tint should be your go to guy. And he doesn't only tint cars, check out his site or give him a call!
5	Courteous and helpful with advice while providing excellent results. I would recommend this business to others with full confidence.
5	Highly recommend getting your tint done with them. Have used them on many different cars and the quality is great!
