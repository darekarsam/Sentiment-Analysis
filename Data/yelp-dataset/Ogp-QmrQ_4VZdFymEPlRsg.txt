5	GREAT STAFF!!! VERY clean property! Fantastic security measures! Judy treated me like a VIP and was able to answer all my questions! They really appreciated me being there and that felt great!
4	Thanks to Torria for a smile and going the extra mile to find my wife and I just the right unit. We left feeling we received value, kindness and a great attitude from a company we initially knew little about. ThanksThe Wise's
1	The facility is clean and secure.  I've been happy with my storage unit for the past 6 months, but they just increased the monthly rate by 25%.  Sure enough, there is a clause in the fine print that states that they can adjust the rent or fees at any time as long as they give 30 days notice.  Heads up for everyone else!
1	I am attempting to terminate my lease with this company, and I have notes from the day I signed the lease when I asked the representative about their termination policy.  She said I needed to inform them at least 30 days prior to move out, and before the first of the month that I am moving out, or else I would be charged for that entire month.  I am 30 days from my desired move-out date, and it's before the first of October, and they're telling me I have to pay the full month of October.  To review my interactions with Public Storage: they have lied to my face, increased rates by 25%, and charged me for double my actual usage during the last month.  This is not a company that I want to do business with, and I would not recommend it to anyone I know.
