5	I've been looking for a foodie's dream place and I believe this is it. They make fresh bread and integrate various influences into there creations. I went there and got a pizza with proshuto  goat cheese and dandelion leafs! What I love about l'entre-pots is it's one of theses places where you can go to hang out on a Friday after work or grab a pastry for breakfast and every time you pallet will go for a ride.
