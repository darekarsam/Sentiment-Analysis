4	Nothin fancy about this Jimmy Johns. Great sandwiches, fast service and it won't ever disappoint. Great option if you're tired of the subway and port of subs down the street.
1	Don't go to jimmy johns they're a rip off there menu says 4.59 but it's actually 6.01 before tax seriously the delivery speed doesn't make up for the mediocre at best sandwich go to subway or sprouts farmers market both are cheaper both have bigger sandwiches and much higher quality
1	I really wanted to like this place but it wasn't to be. Horrible service even for a college town. Not sure what the attraction is here. Rude service, stale bread, meats that have a strange taste and texture and some shady business for dessert. There are so many better choices in town. I've truly had better food and service at QT Kitchen. Just not good at all.The final insult was when we came outside we found a tow truck getting ready to hook our truck up from the spot marked for Jimmie Johns. Asked the tow truck guy what he thought he was doing and he said, "they call, we take it." WTF? I've experienced this "side business" that many restaurants run in Philly and New York, but in Tempe Arizona?Hey Jimmie Johns, if you're gonna run your business like you're in the big city, at least you could try to make a sandwich to match.
