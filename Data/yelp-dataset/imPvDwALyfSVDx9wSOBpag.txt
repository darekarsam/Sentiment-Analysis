5	Mike Tocco put a new tile roof on our older Las Vegas home about 8 years ago.  They did a great job and I was very pleased.  However, I am even more pleased with the service that they have now provided twice over the years when some of the tiles were damaged by wind blown tree branches.  The responded quickly and were very reasonably priced.
5	Mike did our roof ten years ago. I called him this past week because the high winds had knocked our chimney cap off. I just wanted to know how to walk on the tiles to fix it without breaking any. He started to explain it to me and then said that he would send his foreman out to fix it.....at no charge. Freakin amazing and totally wonderful customer service.
5	Replaced some broken roof tiles promptly, efficiently and very reasonably.  In fact, charge was over $400 cheaper than another estimate that wifey gave him $10 more than asked.
