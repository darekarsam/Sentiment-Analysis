5	Came here because of their great deal! 2 pieces chicken and biscuit for 1.99. It's in a sketchy part of town, but the service was good. Usually most fast food places the service is horrible, but this one had great service! Better than a sit down restaurant! I am a huge fan of the honey butter biscuits! They are soooo delicious!!! Wish they still had church's in Hawaii
2	poor clean dinning area. ..working ladies just in the kitchen en el chisme n don't try cleaning not even 1 table outside. ..
