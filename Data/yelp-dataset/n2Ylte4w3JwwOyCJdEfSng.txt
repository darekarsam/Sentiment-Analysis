5	Great office! Very convenient coming in with no appointment and had no wait time. Office staff was very accommodating and polite. Dentist was very informative, knowledgable and friendly. Will definitely continue with this office for all of mine and my families dental care.

He pulled my tooth so fast i never got to feel any pain. Greastest dentist ever i will becoming back for more work to be done
5	Great experience! My 94 year old mom had a bad tooth that was beginning to bother her. She got in right away, had such a great experience at this office that she actually enjoyed having her tooth pulled.  Dr. Harris and his staff are a wonderful find for anyone who needs kind, affordable, urgent or non-urgent dental work of all kind!
