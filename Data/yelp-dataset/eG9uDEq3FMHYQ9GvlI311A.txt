5	I have had Carmen's Cake Pops many times. I love them. I have sent her many clients because her gift giving program is awesome. Her customer retention program is incredible. She drove all the way from Tolleson to Mesa to meet and deliver Cake Pops. Next I want brownies and some dark chocolate popcorn. If you want to thank a client or start building your business by actually thanking people call Q-Tsie!  I love that she works with great people.
5	I've thought about using thank you cards with clients I've booked for personal training packages.  Sending a card, tastefully decorated package and a few freshly baked brownies was a better choice.  Q-tsie delivered to my client on schedule.  The order process was simple.  I am very pleased and would recommend this service to any professional.
5	Q - tie has amazing products. They are a great way to thank your clients with an unusual and tasty treat!
