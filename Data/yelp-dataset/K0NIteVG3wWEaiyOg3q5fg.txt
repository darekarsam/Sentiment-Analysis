4	Great place to hang out in Old Montreal. This place is located right by the docks across from a small park where you can just sit and hang out. As far as Origine Bistro good place to come for a drink or a small snack. Most of the seating is located outdoors, so it makes for good people watching. Service is good and prices are a bit expensive. Still worth coming to especially for the people watching.
2	Tourist trap.The location with the outside seating is nice, I will give them that.However, sangria was meh, beer selection was slim, service was spotty, and the food menu was quite uninspiring.
3	We came here twice during our trip to Montreal and both times had a good experience! The first day was just for an afternoon drink and a snack; the skewers with the tomato, date, cheese, and basil are delicious and a nice treat to share. My sangria was a little 'shmeh' and definitely overpriced. We ended up there for lunch yesterday, a combination of escaping the torrential rains and satisfying hungry bellies. The chips and home made salsa as a starter were good, a large portion for $7 but the salsa wasn't super flavorful. My salmon tartar more than made up for it, however, a nice big portion filled with fresh herbs and paired with a rather loaded salad containing strawberries, beets, almonds, and grapes. The boys each had some sort of sandwich with sausage and saurkraut, which looked pretty hefty. It is a bit of a tourist trap but the food is tasty!
