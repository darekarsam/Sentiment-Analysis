5	OK, does it suck to sit their with tubes in front of people walking by looking at  you like your nuts? YES.Is it worth 12 bucks to sit there and REJUVENATE your body, tiredness, AND hangover--plus get a head massage, back massage and other little extras? YES.Totally worth it. I wouldn't have survivived my 4 hrs a night (NO NAPS WHATSOEVER---WHO Has time for that??)in VEGAS without a lil more oxygen in my body. WORTH every penny. You will walk away feeling like a MILLION bucks and ready to go all night.
5	Everyone is probably skeptical at first and being a local I was a tad bit interested so I gave it a shot. Literally a shot they have these amazing breathe "happy shot" and let me say I haven't pms'd since, it's all natural and a muscle relaxer and was the best thing I've ever tried I highly recommend trying breathe oxygen bars (Venetian, strat, fashion show, & NYNY) they do a session for 10-15 mins and it gives you more energy then a red bull and you don't crash afterwards. With different massaging products I was in heaven 10000 stars * :)
1	I was coming here weekly to get an Oxygen session. I'm a local so even referred people. Bought an $11 can of Oxygen and went to take it back and the horrible experience of not being able to EXCHANGE IT was enough to NEVER come back. They obviously won't be around a long time if they choose money over service. You just lost a consistent customer and they didn't care. Don't waste your money. Also, go buy a "Tens" unit at a Medical supply if you want a massager for half the price of what they are selling a massager for. It's a BIG waste of money!
