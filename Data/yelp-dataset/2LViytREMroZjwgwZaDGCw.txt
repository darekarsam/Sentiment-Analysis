3	Whatever Tie Rack you visit, they always seem to have a sale on and Tie Rack just seems to be one of those shops that's filling a gap on the high street. It's never busy and I don't actually know anyone who gets their ties from here. Still, it's always handy for gifts for male relatives that I never have a clue what to buy for them, every guy likes a nice tie, right?In addition to ties they also have a good range of gents and ladies scarves and gloves all of very good quality and in a good selection. Again, they are excellent gift ideas for little extras.One thing that Tie Rack excels at is their range of small handbags and clutch bags and I have a few gorgeous bags from here that are excellent for proms, dances and other formal occasions where a small clutch is necessary. One in particular I always get compliments on and as it's black, goes with so many outfits!
4	When I think of ties, I think of misery.I think of trudging onto a train at the crack of dawn, of staring vacantly at numerous spreadsheets for 7 hours a day, and of grinding through various pointless, fruitless tasks all geared towards making money for someone I've never met, who is almost certainly a dick.That said, if you're really stuck for your uncle's birthday, then a silky noose from here will just about do.
