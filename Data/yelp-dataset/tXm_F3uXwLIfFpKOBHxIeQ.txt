5	Thank You Guys.  I came in for a routine oil change and it was discovered that I had some unhealthy tire wear.  During the reasonable priced alignment the technician noticed that I had a loose control arm, he tightened it to SPEC and informed me of the issue.  The car drove away so much smoother and safer.  Thanks for the Professionalism, Courtesy, and Kindness. I will definitely come back.
5	I was here to get a set of 4 new tires. This was the only place that had my size in stock, and the price wasn't too bad. When I came back to check on my car, I discovered that they had broken one of my tire pressure sensors. They were trying to make me pay for a new one, but after a bit of discussion with Doug, they did the right thing and replaced the part they broke without charging me. It's hard to find an honest mechanic, but seeing them admit they made a mistake and own up to it says a lot.
5	On my way home I stopped at this shop because my tire indicator light was on.  I needed air pressure corrected.  Doug Kulla was very kind to take me at 430pm yesterday and at no charge.  I was expecting to pay something.  Doug was very professional and I will definitely return to this shop for future honest work.
