4	My partner took an cello to this store to sell, the staff where friendly & efficient. We had come up from Durham & stayed over night locally, the store allowed us to park at the rear of the shop as parking is so bad in Edinburgh. Instument was sold fairly quickly. Communication was lacking on occasions but overall worth the 4 stars.
5	From the moment you roll up to the swanky York Place address of Stringer's, it's apparent that you're in a shop for music professionals. Not really a place to browse, you have to wait for a receptionist to buzz you into the premises, and then are immediately met by solicitous sales staff eager to know your business.The walls are lined with beautiful and shiny stringed instruments in different shades of mahogany and teak, and although I am a strictly amateur musician and simply came in to pick up some rosin for my cello, I could sense that the people here have real expertise, and are used to dealing with players of all levels, from those who play as a hobby to virtuoso performers.This is not the place to pick up a fiddle on the cheap: it is instead somewhere you can depend on for dependable and quality service, whether you're hoping to repair an instrument or acquire something new.
