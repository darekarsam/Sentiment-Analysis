1	These guys are rip off's!!! Will try and illegally tow you! Do not use them!!!!! Beware of this company
1	Terrible service!  The place is an absolute shit hole. These folks are flat out crooks. They towed my car after it broke down on the freeway back to their yard after I requested that it be taken to a local auto service. While in their possession a large scratch was made on the rear bumper and they refused to acknowledge it happened on their watch.  SCAM ALERT!
1	Do not use any of the services the are scam the have connection to the organize crime The tow away cars Illegally and no one can stop them doing that
1	These guys are a scam.  They towed my car from down town. Charged $300+ to get it out even though it had been in tier possession for only 1 hour.  While getting it back there were two others here that got towed from the same exact parking space.  They have only one sign. It's almost on the roof that says no towing. Nothing else. It's an empty parking lot.  See the pix
1	Pure evil scumbags charged 350 to tow car 20 minutes, they are criminals and state should shut them down!
1	Dispatcher was incredibly rude. But it's a tow company, no surprise there. Pulled up in our cab as the tow truck was pulling in with my car. Didn't even park my car on their lot and charged me $300!! What a scam!
1	This place is a scam. The people are not friendly and very unhelpful. The tried to keep my car and then charge me even more for being upset. This place sucks and it's filthy
