4	Bingo! A few friends asked me to go play bingo.  It has been a very long time since I've played.  I didn't know electronic machines do all of the work for you were used now! I was expecting tons of bingo sheets and daubers with lucky troll dolls sitting around. You still have the option to use paper bingo cards as well as the electronic machine.  The bingo room is large and clean.  They offer an enclosed smoking area for bingo players as well. The bingo callers and staff are all pleasant with a great sense of humor.  The open bar staff have been friendly and helpful as well!I had the opportunity to be there on New Years Eve for their bingo event.  Such a fun time with great winning payouts.  The staff made it so entertaining.   It's a fun and inexpensive night of gambling.  Good luck everybody!
