4	So all I had heard about this chain in the past was that it was like Swiss Chalet. Now upon eating here I can agree it is like Swiss Chalet, only better.The staff were friendly and helpful even with their limited English and our limited French.  They have English menus, you just have to ask.  After placing our orders the waitress asked us if we like our coleslaw traditional or creamy.  We all figured that our meals came with it and we had the option of which type and just hadn't noticed it on the menu.  NOPE! A minute later she comes back with a heaping side plate of slaw to share.  I found the slaw to be a little heavy on the oil and not heavy enough on the vinegar.When our meals arrived we were surprised at the large portions for a lunch menu.  I ordered the double leg meal.  I devoured the meaty thighs on my plate like Neil would devour breasts at a fried chicken place (or in a busty woman's bedroom).  The meat was tender and moist, though slightly on the greasy side, and fell off the bone.  Instead of fries I had a caesar salad, which was also fantastic.  It was rich and heavy on the garlic.  It was a caesar that I would expect from a 4 star restaurant.Unfortunately my group and I were running late and couldn't try the dessert that was included with our meals. Next time I guess.  Oh yes, there will be a next time!
