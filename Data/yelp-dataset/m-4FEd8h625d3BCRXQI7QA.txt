5	Fun atmosphere!  New and clean!  Free bottle of water for every 'check in' on social media!  Towels are provided at every session!  Men and women locker rooms! (BYOLock) Nancy, Mona, and Sabrina are beast!  I have yet to take the other classes the mensss teach but I know it's probably as fun.  Bumpn loud music throughout the class makes it much easier to work out. You won't want to keep still with lil john on the background singin SHOT SHOT SHOT SHOT EVERYBODYYYYY. TO NE CONTINUED
5	I love this place and everyone here! Every day they inspire me to be a better person. I'd recommend this place to everyone!!
5	This place is life changing! I've done every workout program, been to every gym, and this place is hands down the best thing I've done for myself! Everyone is extremely friendly. The instructors know what they're doing, they're watching you to make sure you have good form, and they actually care! As well as the people who go to classes, they're so nice and everyone is one big happy family! I love this place!
5	I attended the first class at I LoveKickboxing in Henderson after my first class I signed up for a membership because I fell in love with the classes. Classes are never boring here, the instructors are great.  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to lose weight.
