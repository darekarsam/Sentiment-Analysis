5	Fresh Beef.  Fresh Toppings.  Fresh Fries.  This is what burgers should be.  If 'Cheeseburger' is a fall-back order for you, enjoy Applebees.  If you wake up with a burgerboner, go to Five Guys.
4	Welcome to 5 guys!!  Haha people who are new to Five Guys tend to be impressed. It's a lot of food but be careful, the prices add up! A couple of helpful menu tips:The regular burgers (cheeseburger, bacon burger, hamburger etc) have 2 patties. If you want 1 patty, get the JR ones. Yes, the toppings in red are all free! They're you're standard toppings (lettuce, mayo, onions, tomato, mushrooms etc) so don't be shy!!Ahh the French fries. I, personally, love the Cajun fries. They're not going to burn your tongue right off but they do have a kick! If you want the seasoning on the side they can do that. Or ask for a taste! They'll give you one. Fries again. The regular size will feed about 2-3 people. You get a LOT! So be mindful!This location in particular is always friendly, fast, and clean. They make all your food (fries too!) to order so it's always hot and fresh! It's in a good area but parking can be a bit of a pain because it's in a kind of strip. It's a little hard to see from the road but aim for Old Navy/David's Bridal and it's sitting there nestled next to Game Stop.Enjoy!!!
5	I normally do not eat burgers but five guys are really good!!!! I always get it all the way.Everything on it!!! Go you want be disappointed.
