5	Adorable baby boutique! I went to the grand opening today and everything at Cheeky Chic is so precious. They have unique products, such as indestructible books, super cute baby clothes and accessories and amazing gifts to give to those expecting or with a new baby. I highly recommend checking them out! They had great prices and I will for sure be back!
5	Darling baby boutique that sells very unique clothing and toys! They have a fantastic selection of clothing for boys that most baby stores always seem to lack!! The owners are a mother and daughter team from New York that bring the Soho feel right to Scottsdale!
5	We were in town from Los Angeles and popped into this brand new little store in North Scottsdale. This mother/daughter team are two of the most delightful people you have ever met! Friendly, helpful and accommodating! They had GREAT graphic tees (I must have bought 10) and everything from couture 7 For All Mankind Jeans to great gifts. I will definitely come back to this store next time we are in town!
5	Such an adorable boutique with so many cute things!! Adorable items for mom and baby. Also great customer service and very friendly and helpful. Stop by and check it out!
