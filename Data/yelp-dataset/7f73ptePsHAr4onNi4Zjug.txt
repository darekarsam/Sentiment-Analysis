4	A typical Indian grocery store.  They stock the staples, but have a limited selection of fresh vegetables.  The owner is very friendly, and courteous.  They have the best egg-less cakes EVER.  You must come here purely for the cakes and the puff pastries - YUM.  We also regularly go here to pick up our curry point food.  Curry Point is a business that's integrated within Manpasand.  It's home-cooked Indian food that you can order weekly.  They offer about 10 choices, which you can pick from.  They charge you $40 for 5 choices, or $10 an entree.  We always order 5 choices which lasts about 5 days for us (2 people), for lunch & dinner!  Definitely a great deal.
5	Nice little place hidden at the far end of the Scott Towne Center. Everything I ever wanted in terms of Indian ingredients, I have been able to find here. Lots of huge bags of rice, like 10+ lbs. The produce is in really good shape and better quality than some of the other Indian grocery stores in the area. Prices tend to be lower too. They also carry a bunch of extras, like imported junk food and Indian brands of personal care products. The guy working the counter (possibly the owner?) is super duper friendly and always tries to strike up a conversation with me and asks what kind of stuff we are making for dinner. Very recommended.
4	Manpasand is best for buying fresh vegetabes, Indian Groceries at very low price. Service is excellent. Ower is of Golden Heart. We love his style & affections to customers. He take back goods if stale without receipt without hesitation and provide fresh procduts. Excellent. I have no words how best they are....Please do visit once & then you will be regular visitor.
