5	This is by far one of the best LB's I've been to in a long time. The sales staff was great and the selection is fantasic. Stand alone stores are always better than mall stores. I love that they carry bras and shirts that fit the twins. Wish all the stores were this awesome
5	I shop for clothes at Lane Bryant at least once a month. I have been a customer for over 15 years. They have all sizes and types of clothing. Lane Bryant has a great selection of items and very good prices and discounts. The sales people are always very helpful and fast.
5	I love the clothes here, but the customer service is what truly stands out. Every time I go, they are so helpful & nice. They get on your level, so its almost like shopping with a good friend. Being that I hate the malls, the location is perfect. Its always clean & organized. Definitely worth more than 5 stars.
5	This Lane Bryant is awesome!  I am always greeted by name, with a cheerful smile.the staff here is incredible.  They are helpful but not pushy.  When I have ordered online and I pick up my package, they are as excited as I am to see the contents.  If something doesn't fit, they gladly accept the return. The manager, Coopy, is so friendly and hard working, I'm sure the staff wants to emulate her! I am glad to be one of their " frequent flier's" .
