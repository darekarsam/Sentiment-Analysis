3	This place is Supercuts meets ESPN Zone, minus the bar. If you're looking for a true barber shop with Razor cuts and fades, this isn't it. There's cute girls working here and you're paying mostly for that.
1	Horrible haircut. The lady did not want to hear how I wanted my hair cut. She kept saying that it wouldn't work. And she didn't even know how to do a taper. Just awful. Not to mention that the TVs weren't working.
5	This was like a hair spa for men! I got great tapered haircut, while watching a game, a double head massage and a back massage while getting 20% military discount. Maria was my barber, she was funny, skilled with the clippers and easy to talk to. I not only got a good haircut but felt relaxed and stress-free after my visit. I'm definitely coming back. PS. I hardly ever write reviews, but this place was worth it.
4	I am fairly meticulous about my do, but I keep it so short I can pretty much get buzzed anywhere. As a general rule, I typically won't spend anymore than necessary to get the do done, but sometimes you've got to pamper yourself, right? I've been to this location a few times and have always had a good experience. When I go, I go all the way and get the MVP. You just can't go wrong with a massaging shampoo, hot towel and a neck massage. Misha was very friendly and personable, and did me up right. In reality, they really aren't that much more expensive than the other places, and offer so much more. They will even trim you up for free between haircuts. With sports on every TV, it's like a man cave that offers haircuts. The only thing missing is the cold beer. Of course, if that were the case, nobody would ever leave.
