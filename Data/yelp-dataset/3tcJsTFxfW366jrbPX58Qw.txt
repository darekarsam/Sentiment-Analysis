5	A fine local paper. It's been a while since I've read the print edition, but online keeps me up to date on plenty of stuff around town. Their mobile site works very well, too.
1	Someone really ought to study this paper and its long term negative effects on the community. Today they published a long piece on the dangers of MDMA which has a long fairly well-known track record. Their piece makes it sound as if it's the next crack cocaine, which is a huge distortion, but typical of this paper's inability to keep its deeply conservative and narrow minded attitudes restricted to its op-ed pages. Why they don't do the same hatchet job on alcohol, i.e., wait until they've accumulated a sufficient number of extreme drunken incidents and publish them as if they were the norm, I don't know. I guess too many of its writers like frequenting bars and too many of its readers know better.I'd also have to agree with Lydia's comment. On some of the most important local issues they're almost incomprehensibly muddled, though they're much better when they're ranting about some conservative cause. I've also given up responding to their nonsense on their letters page because they tend to rewrite what I submit to match their own deliberately opaque style. This paper is an unwitting best argument for retiring the old guard and replacing them with new blood and I'd be surprised if any newcomers to the area don't feel the same way in short order. They make the idea of having all legal notices posted to a website seem a no brainer.
