4	This Subway is conveniently located near UNC Charlotte.  As a grad student, I'm constantly stopping in for a quick and pretty healthy lunch.  What I like about this location is that the service has always been very friendly.  And, anytime the line starts to get too long, an employee will always call for back up.  There is more than enough seating to sit inside but beware, as with any Subway, if you stay in too long, you walk out smelling like bread!A little secret they do not advertise - show your UNC Charlotte ID card and get 10% off your order (excluding the $5 foot longs).
4	Overall, this is a Great Subway with friendly service and fast food preparation (line moves quick). The locations is very convenient to UNCC and having Harris Teeter next door is a huge bonus; I'll sometime grab a sandwich before buying groceries (Never a good idea to shop hungry).The restaurant is also clean and tidy. No complaints here!
4	Subway is one of my good choices for fast foods. The one in here close to UNCC is really good. It's a bit far but I go running on weekends and end up there for the lunch. The staff are good and the food is just yummy...of course you should know how to make/select the your own sandwich to enjoy it...
