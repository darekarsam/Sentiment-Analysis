5	I did Sin City Waist Trimmers Boot Camp about in 2012 when I wanted to jump start my body for a more active life style. I was fit but I wasn't strong or anything. I have to say at the time, I enjoyed the classes very much. They were held outside at a nice park and I loved that. The exercise was demanding but that was what I needed. My muscle hurt a lot after the 1st session, so I took a week off to recover. After that, things got easier. I have no complain and would do it again if I need. I would recommend it to others if they are looking for a quick outdoor program to get them in shape.
