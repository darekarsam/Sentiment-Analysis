4	The food and beverages were good; my only qualm was that the service was really slow when I was there, despite the fact that there were only about eight customers sitting around. I'd recommend coming in here for the food and the atmosphere if you're planning to stick around for awhile, but if your time is restricted, you might find the pace frustrating.
4	I would give them 5 stars if it is not called "coffee"house. Love the atmosphere and the food. It's as comfy as a nice friend's living room and their food is as yummy and healthy as from my healthy picky mom.Wasn't that happy with the latte I got tho. It's like... coffee flavored milk. Well, it's not bad, it's just ordinary...
5	CLOSED.It is very sad that this Pittsburgh gem is closed now.
