3	Located in the dismal Riviera in the dismal food court.... this place is your only saving grace for pizza around these parts.Luckily you get a huge NY-style slice... but it's depressing.Nothing about this slice screams 'Vegas-style NY pizza' it's kinda just hanging out under a heating lamp. It's tasty, but you just don't feel anything special about it. Just regular pepperoni and cheese.It'd be cool if they had like pepperoni, salami and ham on their slices, but they don't even bother.Then when you sit at the food court to eat, it makes you even more depressed. An old couple quietly eating next to you kinda depressing....Damn Riviera, you need some work.
1	Staff plays games with pricing. Internet ad cites take-out specials for an entire pizza, but staff told me they know nothing about such specials. And they have the gall to stiff me for one slice. No thanks. I like honest merchants, who abide with their ads, their representations, and their product. Full of internet-special gimmicks. AVOID. DO NOT BE MADE INTO A FOOL.
3	Hot and made fresh to order. Loved the service- very helpful and knowledgable about the menu. True New York style pizza.
