5	Lulu has a cult like following in Canada, and visiting into this store it is easy to see why.  Medium-sized Lulu store in the heart of large shopping neighborhood that gets pretty busy around lunch time during the work week.  The store has a large selection of merchandise, but I found that the popular sizes(4, 6, etc.) were out on quite a few things unfortunately.  Staff is really helpful and unpretentious, of the hipster--outdoorsy type (as opposed to sorority like you would find in DC).   Dressing rooms are large and spacious; although there can be a line to try on merch during the lunch hour.  They also have a large selection of shorts, hoodies and sale merchandise; better I would say then my neighborhood store.

4	Newly renovated (last summer) store in the heart of downtown. Amazing staff - everyone is super helpful when it comes to helping you select the right gear, as well as offering tips on diet/nutrition and where to work out/do yoga etc. They offer free yoga classes on Sunday mornings, and a free run clinic each week, which are definite perks, and they also get involved in organizing community events in the summer. In terms of clothing, I generally love their stuff. BUT their quality has declined somewhat in the last 2 years, causing me to visit the store less. The prices, sadly, have not decreased despite some of the wishy/washy quality of certain items. That said, they do think of everything when creating their designs, like thumb holes, iPod pockets, inner pockets etc. Love that!  I gave them a 4 because I think they're a little overpriced.
