5	As a Property Manager, I know a lot of different air conditioning companies. AAA Cooling is one of the most reliable and trustworthy companies I've worked with. That's why when I needed a new unit in the Fall of 2012 I purchased my Trane thru them. They called and reminded me about my check up and all is great. I would recommend AAA Cooling Specialists to anyone looking for an honest repair company.
5	We just had AAA Cooling Specialists install 2 new Trane units in our home.  We were very happy with their service, from the initial consult, to the completion of the installation.The crew was very polite and excellent at keeping us posted on arrival times and work status.We would highly recommend AAA Cooling Specialists for any size job you may have!Terri F.
5	I have used AAA Cooling at my residence as well as at my rental property. They are the best in the business: always prompt, professional, courteous. They go the extra mile to make sure they provide quality service. I was having trouble with my AC in the middle of the summer -- they were able to come out within the hour and take care of the problem. Furthermore, they always answer their phone after hours so you get to talk to a live person when in need. They always follow up with you within 24 hours after the work is done,--which really shows how much they care and shows  they take pride in their company.Last summer, I needed to replace the entire duct system at my rental property due to mold. They were honest and very thorough. They got the work done right away so that my tenants could move in. They even went out the following day to check everything and my tenants called me to sayhow courteous and professional everyone was.I would definitely recommend them for anyone needing heating/cooling work.
