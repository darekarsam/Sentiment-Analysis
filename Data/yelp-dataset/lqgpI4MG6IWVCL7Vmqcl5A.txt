5	The team at Extra Space on Smoke Ranch has been fantastic!!  Excellent customer service and a rate I am very pleased with.  The unit I rented was clean, the property is clean, and small enough to give the sense of being secure.  I look forward to working with them whenever I need anything because they were awesome!!  Great suggestions in upselling me on the proper lock and ensuring I had insurance as well as what NOT to store in my unit for personal privacy.  I was very impressed...
5	I was looking for a reliable Storage Space.  I found Extra Space Storage on Smoke Ranch Rd. to be just what I was looking for.  The Employees were very nice and accommodating.  The Storage Unit was clean and the Isles were kept clean.  I saw the employees cleaning around the premises which I liked very much.  It is a sort of Environmentally Controlled Space, and I liked that also.  Thank you Extra Space Storage.
2	It was  decent  However  I did get charged  incorrectly  each  month. I addressed the issue each month and nothing  was solved I was still being forced to pay the extra $25 dollars. Other then that the staff was half on the friendly side and the property was decent.
