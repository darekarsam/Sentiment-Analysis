5	Great Service
1	I called Sears Appliance Repair to make an appointment and they sold me a Warranty Called a Smart Deal that would include the service call and cap off the repair at $279.Yesterday. It would include the service fee and all parts and labor and guarantee the repair for a year. Today the repairman shows up and informs me THEY WON'T HONER MY WARRANTY they sold me yesterday because I have a GE Brand Refrigerator. The repairman was in my home at least an extra hour just spent on the phone talking to various people in Sears canceling my contract and appointment and then setting up a new appointment for the repair without a warranty.Also the address on my receipt reads.Sears Home ServicesPacific SouthWest Dist.El Cajon CA92021I doubt the repairman drove from CA.Seems like a scam. I can NO longer TRUST Sears.I will NEVER BUY or RECOMMEND any GE Appliance.As an few hour later Update.My husband complained to their service department and Sears refunded us what we thought was fair. I'm happy for that but it wouldn't of happened unless my husband complained to them. I didn't delete or change the Yelp Rating because other people need to know as they might go threw the same thing.
1	This is the 3rd part that they ordered to try and fix our newer LG dishwasher. Today , almost a month later, their serviceman ID#943 just decided not to show up for the 8-11am appointment. When we called a 4pm to inquire, they did nothing except schedule us for a whole week away. We have been doing dishes now for a month thanks to Sears ( rotten) service. My suggestion is to avoid Sears service like the Black Plague. A whole month!! Sear Home Services(800) 4my-home. ... BLOCK THIS NUMBERThis is a nightmare...Sears should be ashamed. :(
