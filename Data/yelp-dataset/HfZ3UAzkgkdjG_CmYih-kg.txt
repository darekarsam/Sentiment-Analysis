5	Known this dentist for years when he worked for my other dentist. He is fast, effiicent and is a good dentist. I would highly recommend your whole family to have him as your dentist. Now he has his own practice and every time I go to him for an emergency he has handled me and took care of me. I also see his staff has been with him for years which tells me that he takes care of his office personnel as well. They are happy to work for him as well. I feel there are alot of scammer dentist out there but Rene has always proved to me that he is a honest dentist. And will go out of his way to fix his patients teeth. He is not a scammer dentist. And he is honest and will alwas direct you with good advice. He knows what he is doing. And he does it well. He is the best of dentists. And I would recommend him to all your family.
5	i went here to get my tooth extracted, and i was scared and frightened like crazy. This dentist has to be the best dentist i've ever experienced. i didnt feel any pain and he made me feel at ease, before i knew it the tooth was out. I will definetly refer him my family members.
5	My whole family comes here and i think hes the best dentist ever. very nice, caring person and honest. didnt feel any pain and usually im very nervous person when it comes to the dentist but he really makes you feel comfortable. it doesnt feel like a clinic at all. Very different in a good way i guess. i would highly recommend him to anyone.
