4	My experience with Dr. Evangelista has been great. I had surgery on my right knee which he performed the operation. Not only was the surgery a success, he wanted to see me often (most of the visits post-op were free of charge) to check on my progress and tell me what I need to work on at P.T. to get better. Sure enough, he wants you to get back to 100%. When talking to him, I do feel like he cares. He just has a different way of expressing it, which is why I think the other reviewers felt like he didn't care.
5	After being in a terrible accident and rushed into Scottsdale Osborn trauma unit I was lucky enough to have Dr Evangelista on-call at the time. He was very friendly and accepting to the fact that I was not 100 years old like most of his patients. Very good bedside manner and always answered every question I had. He even helped me out a lot on dealing with my insurance company over some bills they sent me.
