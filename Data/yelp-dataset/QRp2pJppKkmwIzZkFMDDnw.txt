4	Our visit to Las Vegas included visiting a couple of Thrift Stores.  Veterans Village Thrift Store is large with lots to choose from.  Though they just recently opened their store was set up quite nicely and pretty organized.  People were very friendly and helpful.  Great prices.
2	Less than great, as thrift stores go. Lots of shoes, decent amount of clothes when you enter- not all items are labeled/priced, which I disliked but they did have some newer fashion items toward the front of the store.Aside from that front portion though, everything else is kind of a disaster- back rooms loosely grouped by type of item (shoes, linens, etc) but completely unorganized and messy and unappealing. Most items extremely dated and some dirty.Upstairs, there are random boutique style offices with art and purses and such available. There's also a large room billed as a library with the store's book and media selection- lots to look through, someone has tried to keep it organized.Unfortunately so much of this store is stuff that no one is going to purchase. Though this is a thrift store, they do need to comb through their merchandise and donate the items that aren't/won't sell- very cluttered and messy look doesn't make me want to sift through all the junk.
