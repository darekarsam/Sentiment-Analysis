5	I just discovered BurnFactor fitness! I've worked at at gyms, done, zumba, danced and lifted weights and I have NEVER had a workout as thorough, professional and results driven as this place has to offer. From the minute you walk in the door, John , their manager greets you, asks about your goals, your vision etc. He gives you a heart monitor so you can see the calories you are burning and the reults you are getting by raising your metabolism. Then, you get an email when you leave showing all of the results of your workout. This place is it for me! The cool environment makes you feel like you are working out on a spaceship. Kudos to Jack Lima, for his incredible vision in fitness that brings a whole new ballgame to working out!
