4	I had a surprisingly good time here. I say surprisingly cause we wanted Indian and picked the closest place to the hotel. I thought it would be touristy and expensive and crap and it wasn't. The food was better than good and it was reasonable enough prices. The food also came with this mint dipping sauce which was divine! Next time I'm in Edinburgh I will definitely try and make it back.
