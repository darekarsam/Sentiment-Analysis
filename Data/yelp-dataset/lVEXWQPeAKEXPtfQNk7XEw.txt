1	I would hardly call this place a spa. They were extremely overcrowded and the utensils were not sanitized properly. The employees were rude (probably because they have so many clients at once). While getting my pedicure I noticed one of the 'clean' towels being used on me had hair on it. The girl who ended up doing my nails was sweet and I am fairly pleased with the job she did but I would not go back.
1	I used to love coming to foxy nails, and Missy was my nail tech, but they changed management and now it is horrible.  It is not clean anymore, the person running the front desk is rude and the clientele has changed dramatically.  I am in search of a new salon definitely!
1	I used to get my toes done at Foxy Nails a few years ago and always found it clean and satisfactory but the facility has become rundown and the staff is rude and racist. When another client wanted to know how long she'd have to wait to have her eyebrows done, the techs made fun of her behind her back (ladies, the "N" word in your native tongue sounds a lot like the "N" word in English, have some class). I will definitely not be going back. The service was OK but I drove past easily a half dozen better nail places and will go there instead.
