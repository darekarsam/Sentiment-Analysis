5	Huge fish sandwich, not too greasy with bun on the side which is critical for takeout!  Surprisingly clean on the inside of this place too which is nice for a bar.
4	Rodeo Burger with fries, 10 wings (wing night), and a coke for 12 bucks. Food was delicious! Took the burger home for later.
5	This is our favorite local bar and grille.  While the menu is not very large, the food on the menu is awesome:  breaded mushrooms, jalapeno poppers, wings, burgers, and sandwiches are ALWAYS delicious!  You have to try the fish sandwich and heart attack burger.  This spot absolutely has the best fish sandwich in town!  However, I don't necessarily suggest going during a Steelers or Pens game because it can get very crowded and the kitchen gets backed up.  When in doubt, you can always order to go!
