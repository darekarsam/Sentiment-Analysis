5	Animals are unpredictable. Sometimes, they pose on a tree branch, smiling for the visitors, acting cute and interesting. Other times, they nap when they should be doing the above (I'm looking at you, beavers). Though skeptical about the Biodome at first, I was super excited that we went. First of all, it's right next to Olympic Park and the botanical gardens, if you're looking for a two-birds-one-stone situation. Second, it's neat to walk through the different areas--sweat in the jungle (I should never travel to South America), feel the ocean breeze, smell the maple trees in the mountains, and get to see animals in their "natural" habitats. Oh, did I mention a horde of penguins and puffins? And a really cute little orange monkey?It'd be a great place for the kids to go, as it felt a little more "active" than some zoos I've been to. Or the adults that, like kids, look eagerly for the next animal in the ecosystem.
