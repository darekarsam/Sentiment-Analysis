5	When my girlfriend and I were looking for a new place in Montreal (we frequent this wonderful city) to celebrate our anniversary, we were looking for a Quebecois restaurant and came upon L'Inconnu.First, the food is amazing.  Chef/Owner Jeff Stirrup takes the freshest ingredients and without doing too much with them, makes an outstanding meal.  My favorite?  The duck breast is the best I have ever had and we always get it.  He also does a wonderful job with foie gras.But not just the food.  The first time we were there we sent in our compliments, he came out and chatted then bought us 3 snifters of different apple alcohols.  We both fell in love with the Michel Jodoin Apple Brandy.  The next time we were there (for our next anniversary) we mentioned this is our second anniversary we have spent at L'Inconnu and he came out again, and bought us our favorite brandy.They also have a 5 course tasting menu that is VERY reasonable ($55CD) and a 3 course at $40CDOverall, a classy place that doesn't break the budget for a nice restaurant (under $200CD for 2 people with 3 courses and wine), terrific food and a great up and coming chef/owner.We really want to see this place do well so we can keep going back!
3	Very nice restaurant. Good food, nice atmosphere.
5	Great food and wonderful service.We had balsamic vinegar ice cream on pear pie.Can't imagine, huh? I thought the waitress was joking.It was pretty good. We enjoyed the crispy pork dish, and 3-course meal (quail, lamb, and dessert above mentioned)Very yummy.They don't have salad... why not??
