5	My daughter received her braces by Bird and was under Dr. Bird's care for 18 months. The professionalism and kindness show by her and her whole team was wonderful. I would not hesitate to recommend them to both family and friends.
5	Braces by Bird has a beautiful, clean, fun facility, but more important to me was the staff and how great they were with me and my daughter. They were very professional and explained everything so thoroughly. I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone looking for orthodontic treatment.
5	The best orthodontists in town!Dr Bird and Staff are both incredibly professional and personally fantastic! First, they offer complimentary consultations which is helpful when starting the process of orthodontic treatment. Not only is their office clean and comfortable but the entire staff is very friendly. I especially like how they go out of their way to educate their patients on the steps and processes involved in orthodontic treatment and encourage me to voice any questions or concerns I may have. Feeling comfortable enough with a doctor to be completely open with them is especially important to me. Ten stars! I highly recommend to patients of all ages!-Michelle Barboza
5	My son began treatment with Dr Bird in their original location and then followed the growing office across the street to their beautiful new location.  My two older children went to two other orthodontists in town but neither could compare to the level of professionalism at Dr Bird's office.  They made him feel comfortable and answered all of our questions.  The hygienist always walked out with him after his appts to give me an update.  The office staff is also very professional and responsive and are great with setting up appts that work with your schedule and your child's.  I highly recommend this wonderful practice!!
