5	i recommend these guys without reservation.  They told me upfront how much it would cost, they showed up on time, cleaned the vent from both inside the laundry room and outside, using a ladder to reach the second floor vent.   They showed me the results of their work, and said I need to call them in ten years.These guys charge a fair price, have integrity and are a no nonsense, hard working father and son team.  I just wish we had more dryer vents in our home so we could continue to do business with them before I'll need them again in ten years.  By the way, if they had told me I need to call them every year, I would have done so.  This is what I mean about them having integrity.
5	Highly recommend this father and son team!!! Very polite, on time, clean, professional I can't say enough about them. They are simply amazing.
5	Very impressed with this company! I called yesterday afternoon and the receptionist was able to get me an appointment for this morning. The two guys that showed up were on time and got the job done in a timely manner. They were personable, explained what they were doing, and answered all my questions. The older gentleman told me a dryer vent cleaning every year isn't necessary, that every three years is sufficient. I had about a half inch of lint in the dryer vent pipe exiting my house. They cleaned the vent from the inside and outside. They thoroughly vacuumed out the inside of my dryer and installed a new exhaust hose as part of the service. $90 charge if you pay by credit or check, $80 if you pay by cash...can't beat that! Highly recommended!!
