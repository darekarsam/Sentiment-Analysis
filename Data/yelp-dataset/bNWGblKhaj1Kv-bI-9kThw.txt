5	I rolled into town for the NAB convention with a unibody mac and a cracked screen.  Armando took great care of me. He owns this store and he is also the lead technician. For a reasonable flat labor rate he gave new life to my beloved MAC and made it look shiny and new. Highly recommended.
5	Love these guys and I trust these guys. Have used the Vegas Computer Doc for years and years. They have upgraded hardware and software for me. They have fixed my desktop and laptops. They helped me setup a home network. They do everything and they do it well. If you need help with your computer, call Armando and Leo today!
5	Vegas Computer Doctor ROCKS!  They fixed an iMac that, without a doubt, would have had to been 'junked' had it been taken to a dealer. Thank goodness I found Vegas Computer Doctor...Armando's patience and calm helped me get back a great machine...and avoid a lot of $$$.  They're trustworthy and reliable.
5	Armando is a miracle worker! I had a hard drive that crashed and was quote $500 from other vendors. Armando was able to recover a good chunk of my data (got lucky and got back most of the important data: photos and some important docs) and it didn't break the bank. Nice thing is that there is no charge if it isn't recoverable.Every since then I brought all my electronics here and Armando is able to give them a second life. Armando and his staff are very knowledgable and professional. I will continue to recommend Armando and his staff to anyone looking for repair and/ or troubleshooting. They have earned themselves a loyal customer!
5	This has been the best interaction I have ever had with computer specialist. I am not very computer literate, but Armando explained things in manner in which I couldunderstand.The prices and the time it took to repair my mac were very reasonable. Overall, I was very happy with their service!
