3	Went here today to register a firearm and it is taking a very long time to get done.  Been waiting for over a hour.  Try other sub stations around the city for faster service.  Staff is friendly and professional, however service slow.
4	Great place to get small stuff done. Really busy on Mondays and Fridays.
5	I doubt that I would ever give a police department any less than 4 stars.  Their job is tough enough protecting and serving.  I am giving this Las Vegas Metro PD 5 stars because I have never had a bad experience here.  First of all, I take a bite out of crime so my reason for visiting a police department is never a bad one for me. My visits here are usually a bad one for the Bad Guy, hah.  This station is self explanatory...walk inside, sign in at Window 2 and then wait.  Majority of the people that come here are registering their guns or  to file some sort of complaint.  I'm here usually to pick up a police report, file one, or drop off some evidence.  My wait has never been bad, but at the same time, I know the best days and times to come in.  Here's a tip...avoid this place on Monday's or a Tuesday after a 3-Day Weekend.  PS:  Not as big has the main location off MLK, but also not as busy.  YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (410/500)
3	I use this location to register my handguns. They are pretty fast here. The people working here are friendly. You don't usually have to wait too long. It is probably best to get here at 9am when they open. It can be busy later in the day.
5	This was very interesting.  Seems like you can get some business taken care of if you go to one of these meetings.  You can talk to the officers after the meeting, and let them know if you think something is going on in your neighborhood. There really willing to help you....Again, if you go to these meetings.  There was some good ideas, but a lot of it was also common sense!
4	I had to stop in for pretty mundane stuff.   No frisking... damn!
