5	This is a proper fish shop that even has water cascading down the window. There is usually a queue out the door that's how great this fish shop is. They don't stock a great amount of unusual fish, but you can get tuna and swordfish on a regular basis. They sell the biggest eggs. The eggs are such great value and are nearly always double yolks.The staff are always up for a bit of cheeky banter.As this is a proper fish shop, it's always closed on a Monday.
