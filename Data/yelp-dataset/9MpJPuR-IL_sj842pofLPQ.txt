3	Stopped by at lunch on a recommendation.  Was told it is good thinner crust pizza.  When I walked in a large thicker crust square pizza was coming out of the oven.  Upon ordering, Alex said I'll just give you this since it just come out of the oven, so you don't have to wait.   The crust was thicker with a nice chewy taste.  The sauce had some Italian spices.   A good pizza.  Not sure if they make thinner crust of not but the pictures on the hand out menu had pictures of both a round and square pizza.The menu has hummus with pita bread, hoagies, burgers, gyros, and salads.
3	This place is the epitome of a mom and pop's corner pizzeria. There is only one table with four chairs (it's designed to be a takeout shop - not quite a dine in), you can see the entire kitchen, and they sell some convenience items such as milk, eggs, and cereal.I decided to order two of the $1.50 slices which were advertised in front of the shop. I would describe these slices as eighths of a circular sicilian pie. Thie slices were reheated and not as fresh as I had hoped. If you come here, then I highly recommend ordering something that is made on to order such as a whole pie or a hoagie.The prices seemed reasonable though I wasn't exactly sure of the portions. I small pie is $5.99, a medium pie is $7.99, and a large pie is $9.99 though I have no clue what the diameter of any of those pies are. There are also about a dozen hoagies on the menu (including a gyro) for about $6. They also have burgers for $2.49!
4	Well crafted pizza with spiced sauce, oaty crust and plentiful portions of cheese and toppings.
2	The place looks so cute from the outside and the people seem nice. The pizza however is pretty bad. Maybe it was an off day? Will try once more. Seriously looked and tasted like the box kits you'd make at home as a kid. Zero flavor.
