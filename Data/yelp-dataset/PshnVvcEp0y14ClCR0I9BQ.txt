4	Very friendly, knowledgeable staff !!!
1	Purchasing any document is super easy and they are helpful in regards to which type of document you need. However, once I had a question about what a line item meant in their Deed, they completely changed their tune. Before I could even finish the question, the woman responded "that is legal information, we cannot give you legal advice." When I attempted to explain that I am not asking for legal advice, I am simply asking what they meant by writing their own document. Again, "you have to call the Clark County Recorder." Really? I have to call the Clark County Recorder to ask them what Nevada Legal Forms meant when they created their own form? AWFUL customer service!!!
