4	As far as these types of small get everything you need stores, no one does it better than Walgreens, except those local small neighborhood walmart stores....but there are only like 4 of those in Az so these are the TOP DOG!.

This is still our go to Pharmacy mainly because of the decent service and proximity to my house.  The pharmacist is helpful,  and all of the cashiers are nice too. Unfortunately for me and my candy addiction,  they have a great selection of candy at good prices.
