5	I only tried their drinks once, so I can't tell much about it. The selection is pretty good, and the caramel latte I tried was very aromatic.What differentiate Hestia is the service and the friendliness. It is rare these days to find companies that will be so focused on welcoming their clients in a warm matter. They take the effort to explain to you right off the bat, instead of you asking for information. Even saying "have a nice day" at the end does a lot of difference.Also, they handle promotions like experts. While waiting for my drink, they gently talk about their buy 10 get 1 free drink deal and their free drink on your birthday.Also, it's a cozy place where you can sit down and study or have a talk with friends. It comes with free wi-fi too :)
5	Their gingerbread chai tea latte is incredible. I seriously thought this was a chain it's so professional. To learn it's independent is very impressive.Pros:-Drinks are fantastic-Well-lit-Super clean and well-decorated-Music is great-Outlets are accessible from every seat-Free wi-fi-Near Guy-Concordia without feeling busyCons:They don't serve sandwiches -- only desserts.
5	Tasty teas and coffee/tea combos. I like that their flavours are relatively original and the ambiance is nice and relaxed. Good for studying!
5	The tea here is delicious! I got rose tea the first time, and a montreal fog latte the second time. The baristas were very friendly both times. Their teas do take some time to make though, so don't go if you're in a rush.
