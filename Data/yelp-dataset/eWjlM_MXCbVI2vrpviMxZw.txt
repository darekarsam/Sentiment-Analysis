5	Love the lighter fare Hook n' Ladder sandwich! It's delicious and the people at this location have always been friendly. This is definitely my "go-to" sandwich shop.
2	There are LOTS of sub shops downtown Madison, probably too many.  This was my first time at Firehouse.  I had the Turkey Bacon Ranch and the sandwich was good, nothing extraordinary.  I ordered a medium and it was quite a bit smaller than what you can get at other shops in the area for the same price range ($6).  I normally just get a sandwich and water for lunch, but I saw they had Frito Corn chips and decided to splurge since they are my favorite.  After paying I went to go grab my chips and ALL the fritos they had were past date.  Today is Dec 12, all the chips were dated NOV. 18.  I went to reach for my 2nd choice, Doritos, and they too were past date.  I ended up with some Chedder Cheese Ruffles which did have a good date.  I would give the sandwich 3 stars because it was good, and warm, but  it was on the small size and pretty much the same sandwich everyone carries.   But the way past date chips show a lack of caring from the management and crew and I had to remove a star for my overall review because of that.
