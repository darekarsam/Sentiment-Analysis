3	I was lured in with their vast selection of poutines and hamburger meats (horse, deer, boar, elk, ostrich, buffalo, kangaroo, rabbit, just to name a few).  I posted a photo of the menu of burgers.I got the 1/4 pound Caribou burger (which was a mistake ... I should have gotten the 1/2 pound) and I substituted my fries for the poutine with blue cheese.Both items were very good.  I may go back for lunch!
4	We literally stumbled across this place after looking for a restaurant for almost an hour, but I'm super glad we found it - everyone really enjoyed it.It was very busy for lunchtime, I think because a hockey game was on television (we were in Canada). They also gave us apples from a local farm to take with us on the way out - nice touch!The menu is pure insanity: there are like 15 types of animals (for burgers) and 10 different kinds of poutine to choose from. We really enjoyed the food, though it was a bit pricey for burgers ($10-15). I'd suggest this in a heartbeat to any visitor to Montreal.
3	Visited this joint over the Summer and three stars is being generous. Very strange menu, spotty service. Poutine was nasty. We were the only people in there yet our waitress went to take a smoke break so we sat there waiting for her to return so we could get our check and get out of there. They had some weird nature program on the TV with a guy skinning a snake which seemed to go well with their odd burger menu. That seemed to be about the only animal that was missing from it.. Would not recommend this place unless you're a starving carnivore.
