5	I stopped by the new location on High Street this past weekend and was wowed by what they have done to the shop. It really is bigger and better, if that's even possible. If you haven't been to 42 Saint, do me a favor and go there today. The store always has the most fashionable, wearable clothes. I am extremely picky when it comes to what I wear, and this store seems to ALWAYS contain the brands and styles that I love. As always, the staff was accommodating and patient and made recommendations based on my fashion tastes. I walked out with a new hat, new shirt, and a smile on my face. 42 Saint rocks!
4	Any place that offers me a cold beverage while I shop gets extra points.  I like the fact that they have a selection of clothes and jewelry that is different than your average store.
