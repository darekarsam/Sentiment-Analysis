5	I love this little paper, so much good local info and it is delivered right to my snail-mail box for free. Met the owners recently, and they are a really nice, cute, salt-of-the-earth couple.*The Scottsdale Downtowner is downtown Scottsdale's premiere newspaper. The Downtowner exclusively covers all that is important to downtown Scottsdale's millions of annual visitors, its residents, merchants, and shoppers. Distribution includes the Scottsdale Convention & Visitors Center, newsstands, hotels, resorts, restaurants, and professional offices, as well as home delivery, and direct mail.
5	The new owner really helped this paper go to the next level. The content is fresh and the design very magazine like. Glad it's still publishing, now that the Tribune is gone
