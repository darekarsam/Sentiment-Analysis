5	I've lived in many apartment complexes in many states and I can attest that San Hacienda is a great place to live. I resided here for 8 months and enjoyed my stay. Granted, I would not live in my particular unit again (it faced Arizona Ave and the street noise is horrendous; the rest of the complex is quiet though), but here are the many 'PROS' as to why I rated San Hacienda 5 stars:Bright units with modern appliances and fixturesClean and beautiful groundsGated / secured entrance - complete with convenient and easy to use remote control or 'fob' entrySuper friendly office and maintenance staffComplimentary office center with free wi-fiGorgeous pool and spacious pool areaWell equipped and modern exercise roomRECYCLING (some complexes don't offer it!) So these are all reasons why I love San Hacienda - I wish my current residence offered half these luxurious amenities! The only complex-specific "CONS" I have are: On the pricey end (my discount pricing for a 2b 2b was $913/mo) BUT it IS luxury so...No bike racks While newer, the washer and dryer machines are cheap and not kind to clothes (typical of apartments, though)Pet areas are blemishes on the landscape (yellow grass) and unfortunately a lot of dog owners do not clean up after their pets, even when they watch them poo! (eww). Overall, I love San Hacienda!
2	At first this apartment complex was great. Then things started going downhill. The management did a terrible job on the end of lease process and I would definitely advice others of looking else where for a place to live.
5	Super inviting community. The front office staff is very helpful and open. The price is fair also. They are building onto the community as well with even newer homes!
