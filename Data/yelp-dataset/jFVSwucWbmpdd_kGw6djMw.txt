5	I come in here every single day, It is like going to the bar for me. I feel like NORM from Cheers when i walk in everyone is like hey Will and they make feel like they are actually happy to see me. Awesome customer service waaaaaaay better than QT or Circle K.
1	This facility is miserable. There is nothing gourmet about the place, so if Danny can respond to this and explain why he is trying to con the public, I would appreciate that much. Bags of nachos with cheese are gourmet? Even Qt has sandwiches and other healthy stuff, but there is not even a refrigerated display in this dump. The coffee was ice cold as well. I won't even buy gas from here anymore due to this guy's deception. Pathetic
1	Gas pumps are very nearly useless. Not just a temporary problem, this is the only chevron I pass on the way to work, so I keep going in there, but today was my last time. The pumps will not accept debit, only credit. You have to go through several questions to be able to pump, which is pretty standard these days, but at this location the buttons hardly work, the screens are broken, and very difficult to read even if you go in and prepay, you have to jump through hoops and if you don't do things exactly they way the pumps like, your transaction will be canceled out and you have to start all over. Every time I have gone in, I see customers frustrated with the pumps. They employees seem to understand how. Ad things are and are patient and do there best to walk through the issues.  If your Looking for a snack, go for it, just get your gas somewhere else.
4	Updating review, because they have gotten new gas pumps. I drove by today and was very happy to see them being installed
