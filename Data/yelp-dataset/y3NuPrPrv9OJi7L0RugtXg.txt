5	Took Luna for her check up at the Banfield in Petsmart. The staff was wonderful and informative. They answered all of our questions. You could tell that the staff genuinely love working with animals. The Petsmart store itself was really clean and all the employees I encountered were polite and attentive. I wish the Petsmart near my house was just like this one. Too bad for me. But good for this store. 5 stars for you!
4	very nice store. the selections are fairly good for all types of animals. they at ban field vets have a traveling aviary doctor which was a little inconvenient seeing as I needed one that day.the bird toys are slim for large birds. the bird foods and treats selections is very good. I like the dog treat section also they have a much better variety than the average grocery store or wal mart. one of my dogs is a 10 year old chihuahua who weighs 3lbs she is no bigger than a can of soda with legs and has very few teeth. the training rewards treats are perfect for her tiny mouth and soft enough for her to chew.I have walked around the store some and all areas have a good variety to choose from no matter what you are looking for. I love that I can take my animals in the store. the staff has always been very attentive and friendly
3	Big box pet supply store, located way at the back of the shopping plaza. Behind even the Home Depot!Once you're in, they have everything you need for the furry, feathered or scaled creatures in your life. Food, toys, litter, cages, crates, dishes, aquariums and so much more. This store also offers obedience training for dogs (cats, not so much).And they had exactly what I needed, a tag engraving station so that I would make one with my name and phone number. For $8.00, a little expensive.
