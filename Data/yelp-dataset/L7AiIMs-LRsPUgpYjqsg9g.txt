5	On two floors, this shop is a tardis in Clerk Street.My daughter and mother in law will not go anywhere else because only the divine Sandy will get to touch their locks. The salon is always buzzing when you go in and even when I'm just waiting to pick them up, I always get offered tea, coffee or wine. All the staff are so friendly and nice and the hairstyles that are created are young and fresh. The staff and salon have won shedloads of awards.I think they're expensive but they assure me that it's all great value and worth every penny to get exactly what you want.
4	I have only been to JFK for a hair cut once, but it was a really good experience. The salon I visited on South Clerk Street was modern and full of spunky young stylists and clients. On arrival I was greeted warmly by the receptionist and hardly had to wait any time at all before the hairdresser took me over to a seat for a consultation; he listened to my attempts to describe the style that I wanted and made some helpful and realistic recommendations. After I'd been shampooed, he then went on to cut it exactly as we had discussed (this is a rare occurrence for me in hair salons). I left the salon feeling happy and rejuvenated, and my hair looked damn good.
3	My friend came here on one of their training days to get a quite good deal of a discount for a haircut. She just wanted to get a trim off the ends, and the trainee did just that. He was super friendly and chatty although he did take ages to finish. But best take your time if you are learning rather than rush and make mistakes. They obviously take training their students very seriously and to a professional level, and my friend's hair looked stunning.
