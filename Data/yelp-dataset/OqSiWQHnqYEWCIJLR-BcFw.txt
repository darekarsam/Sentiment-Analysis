5	I have to give this little gem five stars, as I just can't think what more I would ask of a neighbourhood restaurant. I've been twice in the past month or so, once in a party of ten and once with four. Both times every single person had little but good to say about everything they chose, which in this company I can assure you is unusual to say the least. Add to a pleasant environment, very friendly and helpful staff, and very reasonable prices overall, and it's a very firm favourite.
