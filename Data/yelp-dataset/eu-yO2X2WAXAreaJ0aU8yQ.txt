4	I lucked out on this find! I found a Groupon for an all day boat rental for a great price. I have to say, I always worry about how things will turn out when you get a great deal. No need to worry because they took great care of us. I wish I could remember the name of the gentleman that checked us in (my bad) because he was very helpful and down to earth. We were supposed to have a pontoon boat for up to 10 people, well to our surprise, they bumped us up to a 12 person boat. I felt that they really must take care of everyone that comes to rent and in no way do they lower service just because of a good deal. I very much recommend renting from Bartlett Lake Marina. I plan on going back to rent again very  soon. What an amazing day!
5	Super service.  Had a small glitch on the website (who knows could've been my 'puter).  Phoned to check it out and got a call back in 10 mins of leaving a message saying "don't worry about it, we'll take care of you".....and they did.  Nice people, nice lake, equipment a little worn but functioned great.  Definitely recommended.Re. Ryan's father's day review:  seriously, when have you ever rented a motorized vehicle - car or otherwise - which included the gas?  I guess every car rental company in the world is perpetrating "ripoff's" in Ryan's view.  The marina website and the rental agreement are very clear on this point anyway.
