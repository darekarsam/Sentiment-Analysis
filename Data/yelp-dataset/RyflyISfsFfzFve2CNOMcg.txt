1	My daughter went here for the first year and a half of her life. She had special needs and I do not feel like they protected her enough. She did not walk until she was almost 2 and did not sit up on her own until after her 1st birthday. Basically all she did was lay on the carpeted areas or do the army crawl.  Unfortunately, kids would pull her hair and hurt her even though she was essentially defenseless.
1	oh my god this place is terrible!!my kids was going  to this day care for 1 year.but after 1 year i changed this day care.cuz here is low education and their teachers are like  amature i was so disappoint...but i couldn't change this day care right away until i find out the other day care.when i got new day care for my kids i was soooo happy.the new day care is better than this place.they have home made meals (here is not really home made)and soooo clean and good teachers.i bet this day care will be close soon.
5	This center deserves special attention and appreciation. My daughter, who is now 4, has been attending this school since she was 6 months old. The teachers and staff are literally a second family to her. I always feel completely safe knowing she is in their care. It is obvious that the people that work here have a genuine love for children and are passionate about providing a nurturing and stimulating learning environment for the kids. I've been especially impressed with Inez, the center director. We recently learned that this facility  will be closing its doors December 20th. I was completely shocked and saddened by the news. This Child Time is amazing and I'm very disappointed that it has to close. I wish all the teachers and staff the best and have nothing but the utmost respect for them all. You are a great team and we will miss you!!
