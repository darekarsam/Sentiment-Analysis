1	I wouldn't bring anything here. Better off just donating your stuff, which is essentially what you do when you bring it here!  Brought in a table. They said it was ok after we sent in pics and talked to them. 7 months later, the table never made it to the floor we asked and no one could give us an answer. Now we hear it is in storage. Why? We ask again. The new news is that they didn't put it out cause they didn't have matching chairs! Really? You keep our stuff for 7 months in storage and then we have to call you several times to find this out? Now they are telling us they took it out of storage and we can come pick it up! Bullshit! Deliver it to me...free! Incompetent. Won't go there again!
5	This is by far the best consignment store I have ever been to. They have the best variety of furniture, pictures, mirrors that I have ever seen . The staff are so friendly and know me by name because I am there so often. They always sell my items within a week!! That's unheard of from other consignment stores, They are honest in getting me my money and selling my items. Unlike my other experiences in the past at OTHER consignment stores such as Terri's who totally ripped me off years back. I highly recommend My Sister's Attic and My Sisters Closet. :)
