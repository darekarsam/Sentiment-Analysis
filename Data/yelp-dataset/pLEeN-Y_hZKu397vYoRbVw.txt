2	Employees were very helpful with an exchange we recently made.  Although the person in the check out failed to tell us the shoes were $15 cheaper.  The shoes we were exchanging were never worn and still in the box.  I let her know at the checkout that I would like to return, and then repurchase.  She told me that it's an exchange and that I can not.  As a consumer, it is my right.   It shouldn't matter.  She went ahead and did not do what I requested, and told me that I will be able to use my $20 when I buy $50, so it doesn't matter anyway.  I am so disappointed in the customer service with this store.
