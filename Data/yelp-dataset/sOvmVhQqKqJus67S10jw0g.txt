3	Cellblock used to be called the Padlock in which I would lovingly refer to as the "maxi pad".. well it's the same dark scary bar it's always been. If you like the filthy piggy type action this is certainly the place. Oh but at 2am when the lights come up and you can see who you've been cruising all night.. scary! Don't miss pitri dish corner, also lovingly named for its you know, where the zippers come down and the cultures grow. I once witnessed a circle jerk in this place! No I wasn't in the middle either.. I was in the corner in the fetal position sucking my thumb! Ewww, on the floor.. probably would have been cleaner in the middle of the circle jerk!Anyhoo.. the front part of the bar is alright.. better lighting.. also the bartenders pour strong and flirt well! Woof!
4	This bar has been closed for quite some time.  There's not much hope of it re-opening anytime soon.  This means Phoenix is probably the largest city in North America (metro pop. 4.3 million) with no gay leather bar.  Velocity and Bunkhouse are sort of filling the bill, as best they can, but these were big shoes to fill.  I always enjoyed Cellblock (also known as Padlock back in the day), but she is sorely missed, and needed.
