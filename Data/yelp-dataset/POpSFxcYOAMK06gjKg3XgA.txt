5	I love this place.  It has been 4 years since I stored my trailer here.  It is a little family run business that I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone I know. I went today to dump my crapper and then went inside the store to browse around and they remembered me by name.  Not only do they store rv's they have a small store and also do service.  Best thing was when i used to store my trailer here, I did not have to be there for them to do service.  They would go to my spot and get my trailer,  do the service on site, and then put it back.  Awesome customer service that is really hard to fin now a days.
5	Jeff knows how to take care of his client and always gets me a great price for all my RV needs.  I wouldn't go anywhere else for propane or dumping either.
5	Great experience! Very friendly and very reasonable price. I will be back when I need more repairs!
