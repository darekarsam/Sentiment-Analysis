5	Matt came out to my house and detailed my truck. He took out some scratches with his buffer I thought wouldn't be possible. My paint looks new again! His prices are very reasonable plus He is also a very nice guy too!
5	One of the best, if not the best, mobile detailer in the valley. He works extremely hard to make a car look perfect. If you're looking for a mobile detailerhe's your guy. I've been a car broker for over 20 years and Matt is the only detail guy I use. Very reliable and professional.Some of his clients have extremely high end automobiles, so if you have a Bentley you need not worry. Thanks Matt !
5	Matt was on time and did a great job on my truck. I wasn't too sure on mobile washing and detailing, but Matt changed that. He did a very thorough job both inside and out. I will definitely use him again.
5	Matt did a fantastic job on both my vehicles.  His attention to detail was amazing and more importantly when I would point out a small nit picky speck he didn't sigh or make me feel like I was being too picky (like you will get at a lot of places), he agreed and enthusiastically recleaned that spot and looked over the whole car time and again to make sure he didn't miss any others.  I was really impressed with his work and will definately be using his services again.
5	Extremely detail oriented. Spent all day on my sequoia and even came back for a wash at no charge when it started to rain. Very happy!
5	Matt did a great job on detailing my truck. He showed up on tome and did a great job. I will use him again.
5	Matt did a great job with the detail for both of our vehicles.  He was on time, very professional and brought all of his own equipment and supplies.  The convenience of having someone come to your house and do an awesome job it so worth it.  We will be using Matt again for our detailing.  Prices are VERY reasonable.
