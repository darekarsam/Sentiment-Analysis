4	If you need to wax your eyebrows, you need to come here!LeeAnn is truly the waxing brow QUEEN! (: I stopped going, since my skin has been getting a little too sensitive for wax, but for 10$ this is the best you're going to get! (:**LeeAnn is off Tuesdays, so don't bother going on that day.
5	I got a great French manicure there! From out of town and kind of stumbled on it. Kinda nervous to do that but was definitely satisfied. Will go back whenever I can!
4	Hi there! So after being turned down not once but twice around the corner at L.V nail I have decided to make this my neighborhood nail shop. The ladies in there are so nice and helpful, they are not the type to keep speaking in their language and make you uncomfortable. The pedicures are 20$ which is hard to find around here. I recommend KIM & NANCY they are awesome. GIve them a try... happy yelping amigos!
