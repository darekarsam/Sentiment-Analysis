5	I cannot attest to the food but the selection of drinks is great and the service impeccable. It is primarily a wine establishment but their beer selection is good and they have some 12 and 15 year choices for scotch. Our waiter was amicable and attentive. We were recommended a pink sangria which was great, and the drinks that followed were quality as well.
