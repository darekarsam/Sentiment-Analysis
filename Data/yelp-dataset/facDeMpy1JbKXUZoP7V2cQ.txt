5	Great customer service
5	Great customer service! Ask for Juan.
2	Oh what fresh hell is this? It's Verizon and good luck trying to get ANYTHING done at this store. The wait is actually longer than the DMV. Associates are nice, but seriously, there are no words for how long this wait is. I was number 2, have been for awhile, then I was number 3 for a bit, now back at number 2. End of contract can't come fast enough. Ugh.
5	Logan was exceptional in customer service! He tailored everything to our specific needs. He mentioned ways we could save money on our plan. He went out of his way to make sure we got exactly what we came in for. Best wireless experience ever. I will continue to do all Verizon business with him at this location.
5	I have to rave about Cesar a Verizon I think I spelled his name right. In Avondale Arizona. He was so courteous and nice I felt like I was in another world because you don't get that kind of respect anymore and I truly appreciated all his help because not everybody knows about phones and what they do especially is older folks like me. So I'm going back into Verizon Friday to buy a Bose system because he was so cool I really like that guy I told everybody about him if you want a good decent guy go to that guy no pressure just a regular nice young man.
1	This verizon location is horrible. The customer service is a NEGATIVE 5 stars. The employees are rude and only see dollar signs rather than assist their customers and provide a great cellular solution. You are better off signing up with another cellular provider or going to another location. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND people NOT to come here
