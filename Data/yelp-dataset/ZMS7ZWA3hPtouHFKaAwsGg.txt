4	I went to The Brow Boutique while I was in Madison for the summer. The staff and space was great. My brows looked great too. If you are in need of threading, this is the place to go.
5	This place is fabulous. Tina did a wonderful job with cleaning up and shaping my eyebrows. I've been going to the Brow Boutique when Ashu had a tiny space off of Mineral Point Road. I was recently excited to learn they opened a downtown location., since driving all the way to the West Side location can be somewhat of a nuisance. I've been getting my eyebrows threaded for over a decade. If you've  never done this, it's absolutely worth it, as it lasts longer than tweezing
4	The place was completely empty however the women working there had impeccable service and was very helpful. She did an excellent job with my brows. I'm not from Madison and I was looking for a place to walk in, but I will definitely come back next time I'm in town
