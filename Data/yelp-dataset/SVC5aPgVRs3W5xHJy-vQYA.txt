4	Inside is huge & they have plenty of tables even when it's busy. Baristas have always been very friendly which is much different from the Union Hills location. Plenty of parking too!
2	The location is much easier to get to and out of then the now closed 7410 West Bell Road store. Inside is much larger than previous location.  However it is not nearly as good of service now. Half a** the drink making. I guess in this area not a lot of competition.  I just guess I expect more, living in Washington.
5	Really love this location.  Plenty of parking and easy access.  This location has friendly baristas and a drive thru.
1	Huge fan of starbucks but this location was the worst of the worst I've been too.  The barista was rude and clueless about the drinks and POS system.  Took her 10 min to ring up 2 drinks. She Over charged me for my drink and received the wrong drink at the end.  This almost made me hate starbucks as a whole.  Will still be a customer just never back here even if they got the last coffee bean in AZ.
1	Ordered 5 drinks,  paid for 5 and only got 4...and they are not even answering their phone..very bad customers service will never go back to this Starbucks again
5	I like this Starbucks. The drive thru is always lightning fast. The staff is efficient and friendly. And the location itself is pretty big for a Starbucks. I'm glad they opened a location close to work for me.
