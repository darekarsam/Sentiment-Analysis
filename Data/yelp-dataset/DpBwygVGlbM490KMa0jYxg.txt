3	I've never had a problem, but I only use the drive-thru ATM.
1	Opened a savings with a few grand - tried to pay my roommate rent through their app - wells fargo to wells fargo and come to find out I have an account that doesn't allow use of the app and/or transfers like that. So what? Write my roommate a check? Ugh!! Then I go online to purchase airline tickets and it's denied on my card saying my daily allotment is like $250 .. nice I have over 5k in the bank and can't access it. I go to the bank and close my account, and deposit it into my B of A .... and go home and buy the airline tickets. Wells Fargo you got some nerve.
