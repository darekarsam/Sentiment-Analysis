4	I only tried a few samples of their goods today because I ran across their table of free samples at the South Park Mall of all places.  I have to say, I would have gladly gone back, cash in hand, for more!  What did I try, you ask?  Well I began with the mini baked loaded potato, which was perfectly decorated with just enough cheddar and bacon..mmmm.  Even after sitting out, the potato was not dried out at all, it was exactly the bite you want out of this tasty treat.  There was also crab cakes bites accompanied by a drop of some kind of spicy sauce, also yummy.  Then there was a mini sandwich of some sort, honestly had a hard time deciphering what exactly was in it...some kind of cranberry cream cheese and meat...eeh.  Then, saved the best for last, a bite if puffed brie with a brush of honey.   All in all, I would absolutely recommend their catering to any kind of event from wedding to corporate!

They made sure that there was something for everyone - including Roasted Vegetables,  Ravioli filled with butternut squash, shrimp and grits, roasted turkey, red meat,roasted potatoes, and much more. If you are looking for a catering company that executes beautifully, you might want to check them out!
5	Wow, I don't give many 5 stars but Best Impressions earned this one.  They catered our recent wedding at Daniel Stowe Botanical Garden and they hit it out of the park.  From working with Daniel and his staff to the excellent grub to the professional wait staff, that did an excellent job.  Several guests have praised the quality of the food, preparations, and accommodations and they were one of our easiest vendors to work with.  I recommend them hands down!
