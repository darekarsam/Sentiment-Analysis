1	What can I say about this place? I've been here three times and every time it was the same and I tried to give this place a chance because I really enjoy the selections here. Coming into the lot there is garbage everywhere and the building itself looks pretty run down. The wait times for food in drive-thru and while parking are outrageous, I thought this was supposed to be fast food?! There are never enough workers here and they look exhausted trying to limp through the rush and on my last visit when I went inside to complain I noticed one of the cooks had what looked to be like sores all over his arms. The inside was a disaster and there was no organization or real leadership here I'm honestly surprised this place is still open.
2	I only....only come here for drinks and french toast sticks. I gave up on their hamburgers long ago....Once in a while I was surprised by how good the hamburgers were but other times I was completely disgusted by the quality of the lettuce and toppings. Do your self a favor and head to a better option and stop by here for happy hour drinks.
1	I asked for a drink with no ice, they brought me a cup filled with ice. I asked for another drink and reminded her I wanted no ice, so she brings me a cup of ice. I told her again I wanted no ice, so her manager comes out and says, "What does he want" so I said I keep asking for a drink with no ice. He brings me a drink - with all ice! They also kept bringing me a medium when I asked for a large. I said I'd even keep paying for a new drink. They don't listen, and they don't care about customer service at all. This place is horrible.
