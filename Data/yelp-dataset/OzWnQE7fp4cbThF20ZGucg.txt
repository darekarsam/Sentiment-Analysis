5	Amazing customer service! My daughter and I were due for an upgrade for both of our phones so we went in to see what kind of deals we could get. I had a really old phone and she was looking to upgrade to the iPhone 5s. Elias F (who was AMAZING!) got my daughter a 25% discount on a beautiful case, bought her cracked iPhone 4s back for way more than we anticipated, and I got my phone for free. We both got free screen protectors and they did an amazing job transferring our information from our old phones onto our new ones. Elias F was such an amazing employee, definitely should be getting a promotion sometime soon! Great job Sprint, you guys are really awesome!
1	I find it sad that you can walk into a store and no associate will even make eye contact with you or say, hey, we'll be with you in a moment.  I was just at the store and stood for about 10 minutes looking  at phones thinking about switching from verizon and I understand that there are other customers, but some of them had two associates helping them.  I just think someone could have broken away to say hello at the very least.
