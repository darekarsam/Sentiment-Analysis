4	Cool place!  Bright green and red with a few bright red sofa's and some tables to sit and relax as your eat your Yummie frozen yogurt or have a Bubble Tea.Great for a treat.  Stopped by for a treat after soccer game and the kids had fun making their own frozen yogurt treat.   Some great flavors, (forgot how many - 8?).I had a peach and mango bubble tea that was great.Notice some brochures for Saigon 88 and Pho Kim 88.  The women behind the counter said that the restaurants have the same owner.
1	I was very disappointed. I love Bubble tea, so the thought of having an option in the South Hills thrilled me. First, I was disappointed they did not have coconut. But just because that is my favorite, no big deal. We ordered green mango and jasmine green tea. Sadly, the bubbles were not cooked properly. They jammed the straw, and the couple I did get to come through the straw were very hard in the center, so they were not fully cooked. And I know the drinks are meant to be sweet, but they were over the top sweet. We threw out both drinks. I was so disappointed as I really was hoping this place would be good in the South Hills.

3	I love that the Tapioca balls were soft and not stale/hard like other places in town. But, the smoothie that came with the boba was less than stellar. It was extremely ice-y and hard to suck through the straw. Might be worth trying the ''tea'' boba instead. The drinks are a little expensive in my opinion. Tea drinks are $4 but $0.50 extra for boba balls. Smoothie drinks are $5. They also sell self-serve yogurt with different toppings. The decor is interesting. Very asian/buddhist inspired.
