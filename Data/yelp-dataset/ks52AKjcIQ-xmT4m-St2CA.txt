5	Used this laundry mat to wash my slip covers. I researched the area, and found this wonderful, cleanest laundry mat I have ever been in. Kathy was the attendant on duty, she was so friendly and helpful. Looking for  good clean (washing machines are spotless), this is the one!!Thank YOU!!
5	This place was great! We just moved into the area so I walked into this establishment with about 10 large bags of clothes (can you imagine?!). From the moment I walked in, the owner welcomed me and gave me great advice about how to organize my ginormous amount of clothes and save.  I've had a lot of bad experiences with laundromats in my life, but this one was definitely not one of them!  The place was clean and the owner was super friendly. I recommend it highly!  :)
5	AMAZING! Super clean, super friendly and super helpful. This place is immaculate and I felt very safe!  Whenever the quarters got stuck in one of the machines, the nicest male attendant quickly came over to help. My washng machine at home is being repaired, so this is the 1st time in 20yrs I needed to go to a coin-op and what a great surprise...well worth the drive from North Scottsdale!
