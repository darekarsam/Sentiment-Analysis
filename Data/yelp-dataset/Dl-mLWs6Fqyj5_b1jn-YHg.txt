1	Very expensive and the doctor gave me the creeps.
1	I came to them a year ago to get contacts.  The staff is horrible.  I work in the customer service industry and it is pretty obvious to me that customer service experience is not required to work there.  The front desk woman in particular is rude.  I came back because I needed to order more contacts.  I was given a new file, treated like a first time patient and even though I told them  I had been there before, they have now sent me a bill for a contact lense fitting which they expect me to pay.  It seems to me that they start new files to treat a patient like they are new and not a returning patient so that they can charge current patients extra fees.  I am furious because this is technically fraud.  Patients records are supposed to be kept for ten years and updated as people come back in for appointments.  Either they are being shady so they can bill people extra or the staff is just that incompetent that they do not keep organized records.  I am going to make a complaint to their billing department when they are open.  They also keep people waiting an extremely long time even for a medical office.  I will not go back.  And I will not pay that bill they sent me either because it was totally made up on their part.
5	I had a great experience at The Eye Center. Dr. Sayegh is extremely knowledgeable  and really cares for his patients. The staff is very helpful. Beautiful new clinic. I highly recommend it!
