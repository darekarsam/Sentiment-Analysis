3	Took my husband here for a quick haircut while out running errands,  They were quick, efficient & I liked the results. We were in and out in twenty minutes and on with our day.  Its a bit out of the way for us, but when in the neighborhood again, we ould definately stop back in for another quick cut.  By the way, they are Located right next door to Thai Basil, the best Thai restaurant in town!
5	Steleta has been cutting (and dying if you must know) my hair for years and at a great price. She really knows how to do hair. She was trained in upscale New York salons. I would not go anywhere else. People stop me all the time to ask me where I get my hair done. She also cuts both of my pre-teen and teen boys hair and she does an amazing job.
5	Steeleta and Fatima are awesome!  We have been going to Sports Cutters for 3 yeas (since we moved into the neighborhood). My three boys and husband all go. They are consistent, do a great job, and are both really nice. They are super sweet to my youngest, who is now 3 yrs old.  I highly recommend Sports Cutters!
