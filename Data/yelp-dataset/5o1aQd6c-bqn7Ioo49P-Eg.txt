5	Now known as Zen Cleaners.  They offer the best dry cleaning service in the area.  A little higher in price but well worth it imo.
4	Friendly service and fairly priced! I had a bridesmaid dress altered and was very happy with the quality of work and speed of service!
5	Had an emergency qipaow dress situation and needed it made smaller in a hurry. Went on the rec of my bridesmaid and I'm v happ that I did. Good pricing and fast service, my dress was ready faster than I expected it could be!
5	I love ZEN cleaners.  They have the best seamstress.   They are hands-down my favorite cleaner when it comes to tough jobs and alterations.  I took an asian rug there after a pet accident and they actually went over it twice for me to get stain out.  They are very fast in turning around alterations and it's a very comfortable environment to do fittings!  Highly recommend!
