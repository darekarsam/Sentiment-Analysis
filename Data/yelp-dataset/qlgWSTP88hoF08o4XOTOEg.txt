4	Visiting from the US we were glad t o find this place!Ideal to relax, nice ambience! staff young and friendly... love the late hours...
1	Fail.Came here for iced tea. Why is it so difficult to find iced tea? Anyways, I asked specifically if they can make an iced tea, was told yes. So after telling them the two teas and sizes I needed, they brewed them in their appropriate hot cups and then handed them to me. I asked if there was ice for them "ohh yes!"So she pulls out this tiny little plastic cup, maybe MAYBE half the size of what the hot cup was and said "this is all we have for iced tea" it was literally a sip. So it being all hot and steamy i just said fine, and watched as she poured all of the tea down the sink to put just a little in these tiny cups. Anyways, the rest of the cafe seems like a nice place to hang out in.I think i am all set unless its hot tea.
