4	Nice cozy atmosphere, friendly service, and a drink like the Campfire Mocha?  Sign me up!  It's basically like a coffee s'more in a cup, and oh so snugly wugly feeling on a dreary day.  Try it!
3	I really enjoyed stopping here on this rainy morning with a friend.  The chairs/loveseat by the fire place were nice. (would have been nicer lit, but we didnt ask..they probably would have turned it on if we had asked).  The coffee was good. I had the special "lucky irishman" which was perfect.  My friend had a plain latte and enjoyed it.  The ONLY downfall for this place is the espresso machine sounds like the mothership is landing right on top of us.  It was so loud my friend sitting two feet from me speaking louder than average was not audible at all. Other than this small but important detail: a very very nice place to enjoy good coffee!
4	For as long as I've worked near Mallard Creek Church, I've never gone into this location... until today.  It's your typical setup... there's a lot of room and tables to plop down in and use the wi-fi and enjoy good coffee.My real visit to this location was secondary for the coffee and firstly for a Papyrus card I needed to send for a long-overdue graduation gift.  They have a good selection of birthday and (next holiday coming up) cards... I ended up getting a blank one.  Hope my niece understands.The staff was very friendly and patient with me (trying to make a selection after already exhausting my selection abilities on cards).I need to frequent this location more often... but most likely I have a tendency to get the "blank" out of Mallard Creek Church (area) right when the clock hit's 5 o'clock.
