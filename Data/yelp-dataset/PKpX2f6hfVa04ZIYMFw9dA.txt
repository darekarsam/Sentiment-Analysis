5	For those of us who believe we should've been born during a different era....or at least dress like we were....there is Kitten Retro Glamour. This amazingly cute boutique offers classic vintage fashion, but from new labels like Pinup Couture and Tatyana Designs. I usually buy all my pinup and vintage-inspired fashion online or during trips to Las Vegas. Thankfully Kitten opened up right here in Phoenix!! Not only is the boutique so cute and pink and girly, but the owners little touches go a long way toward good customer service and repeat business. I couldn't believe the cuteness of her pink pastry gift boxes and hand written thank-you napkins placed in my shopping bag. She was amazingly helpful as my sister tried on dresses and I perused the accessories and gushed over her new store. Thank you for opening up locally! Now I can get my fix anytime I want!!!!
5	This little shop is absolutely adorable and spot on!!! Love love love this place!!! The owner is so sweet and welcoming!! Can't wait for more new items to arrive!! The clothing is of the best quality I have ever seen!! Not cheaply made as I have experienced from other stores.. I will def shop here and invest in this locally owned shop!!!
5	I'm going to be honest. I've avoided this place since they opened in July because I was afraid of sticker shock. My fiance gets his haircut next door every month and I'm usually with him. Last weekend was the Pinup Pop Up event and I was getting antsy waiting around so I reluctantly went in to Kitten Retro Glamour expecting to be let down when I looked at the price tags. I TOTALLY wasn't! For vintage inspired QUALITY clothing, this place has some of the best prices I've seen! I found a brown faux fur stole that the owner generously placed on hold for me for a week so I could come back to try it on with my wedding dress and it was perfect! I plan on coming back after the holidays to try on a few other items! Kitten Retro Glamour won't let you down!
