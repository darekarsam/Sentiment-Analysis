5	Daniel and Mario are excellent teachers ,and the team is full of some awesome people. I have been with them for almost 2 years now and plan on continuing as long as I can. I definitely recommend this gym to anyone who is interested in learning MMA, Muay Thai, and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

5	This place is really good.  If you want to learn bjj and mma, this is the place to go. This is a legit fighting gym. If you just want to get in shape this is a great place,  but it is even better if you want to fight or compete in bjj, muay Thai, or mma. Also, they are not high pressure sales people. If you come out for the free week and somehow decide it isn't for you, they won't constantly harass you with calls asking when you want to sign up. But I think you will fall in love with the place of you come try them out.
