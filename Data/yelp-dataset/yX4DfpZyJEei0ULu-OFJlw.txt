4	Been going to Shawn Benso, DDS for awhile now. Overall been pretty happy with them. My wife also sees him and she is in there all the time for work and Dr. Benso has thrown her a fee freebies like fixing chipped teeth and such.
5	Have been going here for a few years now. Have seen both dentists & they are both very friendly & do great work. The hygienist is also very good. They offer later appointments for after work which is always nice.
5	Great dental office! I was referred here by the owner, and I was not let down. The wait times were nonexistent, the clerks were very helpful and friendly, and the owner, Mark, personally greeted and evaluated me. I would definitely go back and highly recommend this place to anyone needing their teeth done!
