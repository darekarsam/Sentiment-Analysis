3	Small branch located within the shopping plaza by Walmart & Starbucks. There's always security guards pacing back and forth which is either a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. It's not my favorite location but the tellers have consistently been friendly and it's close by. There's always a line that seems to take forever but honestly what BofA isn't like that? Unfortunately there isn't a drive thru ATM here. But there is an ATM that they partition off, which allows you access once they've closed for the night. The card reader is a bit temperamental. You might have to swipe it a few times before the door will open. I guess I don't have the magic touch because this happens to me every time I go. :/
1	The customer service at this branch is HORRIBLE!!! Very time i go in they make me feel like I'm inconveniencing them. I went in just now and asked to speak to a manager because my debit card was stolen and they actually asked me to make an appt!!! I HATE this bank!!!
