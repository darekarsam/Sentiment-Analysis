2	really not the best place to eat even if you spent most of your time at UQAM. the only good thing about this place is that its a great meet up place after an exam to drink your failure away without setting foot outside especially during the cold winter nights.beer is cheap enough for a student and that was all i needed to know. its not good beer but you know, does the job to help you forget..
