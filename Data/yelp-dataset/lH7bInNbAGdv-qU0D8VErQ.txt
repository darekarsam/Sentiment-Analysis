4	We have been using Horizon Pet Boarding & Grooming for nearly three years and found them to be great!Lorraine, our groomer does a wonderful job.   She is also very reasonably priced, as compared to nearby PetSmart, or the Posh Pets in the area.  Those two were our previous dog groomers and we will never go back now that we have found Horizon Pet Boarding & Grooming and Lorraine.Yes she's that good, and a hard working nice person to boot!
5	Excellent people and service! We boarded our 3 month old pup and similar aged kitten with Horizion for a little over a week recently and I could not fault the place. This was my first time to board an animal in Phoenix and we looked at many places before we arrived at Horizion. We live in Tempe. Michelle greeted us and showed us around the facility and we knew immediately we could trust our two to them. All the staff were extremely friendly yet professional. When we returned to collect our boys, it was obvious they had been Very well cared for and it was almost a struggle to get the pup out the door.I would highly recommend Horizion and will definitely use them again.
5	We've had nothing but excellent experiences boarding our dogs here.  They are kind and understanding and the dogs come back without fleas or ticks every time unlike other far more expensive places.  And they don't arbitrarily decide to treat the dogs and then slam you with a bill when you pick them up unlike other facilities.
