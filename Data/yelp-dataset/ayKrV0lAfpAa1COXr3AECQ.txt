5	I joined on opening day and have yet to have a negative experience here, EVERYONE at SoNo is friendly and helpful. Very conducive to a good training environment. I had a GI on order and Sonny let me use a spare he had on hand to train till it arrived. I forgot water and a classmate I just met let me bum a spare gatorade off him... I already feel like part of the team and hope the best for Sonny and his business, check it out if you're interested!
5	I've known Sonny since he was a purple belt.  He has always had a unique way of teaching, in which he could show a technique and you then could go and use it live.  There have been very few instructors that have the ability to show jiu jitsu the way Sonny does.  I have been training on and off for nearly a decade.  In which I have trained amongst some amazing trainers.  But I can honestly say Sonny rivals the best I've had the privilege to train with. If you want some great training and support in the room and at competitions this is the place to go.
1	My son has been taking jujitsu classes here for 4 months I guess the classes are not that bad . What I didn't like was that I decided not to take my son any more but forgot to cancel before they charged my card so before they charged my card again I called to cancel and the receptionist told me that the manager said he would not refund my money and since I didn't give two weeks notice they are going to charge me for an additional month . Pretty much they have poor customer service. The girl that called me told me about policies that when you sign up no one tells you .
