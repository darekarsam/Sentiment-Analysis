5	Charming, colorful, wonderful light, delicious sandwiches and pastries. Take home a bag of frozen croissants and fill your home with the smell while they bake.Note: I wrote that a few months ago. It seems the place got a wonderful new owner since then (I am assuming that but not certain). In any case relating to the current owner and have you ever just felt drawn somewhere? I always went to all the OTHER cafes that are abundant in this area and always avoided THIS place. Now this is the only place I go practically. The service, the care, the owner actually being there, something about it now makes it the most desirable cafe in town! Something new about that place draws us there most every day. Amazing.
4	The service at this pleasant, bright little cafe is wonderful, including my server Christianne and whoever picked and heated my crepe.The chocolate-almond croissant is so delicious that I wanted to eat six of them.The crepe was hot, succulent, and brimming with tender ham and good cheese.The coffee tasted like my shade-grown childhood, but much stronger, and warm and good.The Breton pastry was a tasteless, overcooked waste of everyone's time. I cried a little.Even though the cafe, like so many these days, believes deep down that it does have wireless, it really doesn't. I'm stealing wireless from the Starbuck's next door. That's very lame.The selection of cold drinks is poor.Bottom line: not the best place to get work done, but a great choice for a quick and lovely bite.
