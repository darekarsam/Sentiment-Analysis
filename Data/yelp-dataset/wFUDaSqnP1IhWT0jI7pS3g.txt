5	This store was great with great customer service! The employee recommended good phones and features and was very knowledgeable. I recommend this store to anyone!
1	Don't go here.  You are better off going to the Verizon store. I bought a charger from here that didn't even work.  I exchanged it 2x & it was still not charging my phone
5	The reps at your Verizon at your Collage Park Store were so helpful and patient.  I've had to go by there twice for major helpl.  They relved everything.  Very good customer service.  Rep names Justin Taylor, Marissa Labag abd Lysette Victoriano.
5	I very much appreciate the assistance I received here.     In particular,  Justin Taylor.   assisted me in a very professional and certainly knowledgeable way. The store is in a convenient location - in the Whole Foods Plaza at Rural and Guadalupe.   The day I visited the store,  the District Manager happened to be there. He, also,  was very professional and helpful.
