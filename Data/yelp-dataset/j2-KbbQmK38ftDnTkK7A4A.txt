4	The best way to sum this place up is by using their own slogan...* GO Fishing* GO Skiing* GO Caravanning* GO Travelling* GO Camping* GO Climbing* GO Running* GO Walking* GO CyclingYou can also add GO Horse-riding, GO Canoeing, GO anything outdoors. These guys sell everything, ranging from in-store 'black label' brands through to the well known premium brands such as North Face, Berghaus, Coleman to name a few. Their prices are very competitive at all levels and the range, well frankly it's massive and the store itself reminds me of a 'we sell everything you need' Midwest outdoors store in the USA.I love this store!
3	Generally disappointed by the cycling section - there wasn't much to choose from and I was confused about price (I thought this place is a discount store?!). If you're into your bikes then I would give this place a bit of a body swerve and opt for one of the local independents - you'll get a way better standard of service and probably better selection of whatever it is you're looking for. Saying that, I suspect this place caters well for walkers as there was a lot more on offer for outdoorsy types. Tents, trews, shoes, socks, tops and hats galore. Also lots of camping gear and stuff of that ilk. I think I'd be happy to come back here for general outdoor stuff (think Tiso) but any bike bits will likely be a disappointment.
