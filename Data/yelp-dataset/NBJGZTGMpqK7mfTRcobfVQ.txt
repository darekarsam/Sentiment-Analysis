5	Great place.  Home of the cherry limeade.  So delicious.  And they even have happy hour.  There are only a few that use roller skates, but haven't seen too many of the staff here on them.  Quick and efficient with drive-thru and drive up.
5	Always love coming here , its a real treat .. Lemon berry slush and jumbo popcorn chicken yum !! And catch them in happy hour for AWESOME deals
1	Horrible overall. I spent my whole 30 minute lunch break in the drive thru for a medium powerade slush and a small order of Mozzarella Sticks. Every time I have gone since, I spend about 15 minutes on average JUST for a slush. The majority of the slushes I receive are watered down and are unsatisfying. I love the flavor of the powerade slush but I hate the service this Sonic has to their customers. Definitely disappointing.
