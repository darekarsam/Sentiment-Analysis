5	Family owned and local option to get decently priced healthy (they screen everything before putting it on the shelves!) for your mutts! The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. They have pet perk type rewards so you can get eventually get a bag of food for free or get money off if you're only buying treats or accessories. Oh and did I mention they give free samples?!
5	My husband and I loved this store. We have a new puppy and needed food for him. The young lady greeted us right away and was available for questions. When we were checking out she put us into their computer system and asked for the names of our pets. She told us about all of the specials they do and encouraged us to being our dogs in on Fridays. It was over all a really great experience. We have been shopping at a different pet food store for a while with mediocre service. So glad we went into this store!!
5	The staff are helpful & friendly and the prices are reasonable.  I have 2 Tonkinese cats and 1 of them developed an allergy to her food (Royal Canin) and the staff directed me to a single protein no filler food.  Since the switch she's back to normal.
5	I'm currently looking for a beagle, and a friend recommended this place. I was very pleased with the staff, they were very helpful explaining to me everything I needed to know. I didn't get get one yet from there, but I'll definitely come back, and not only for the free samples.
