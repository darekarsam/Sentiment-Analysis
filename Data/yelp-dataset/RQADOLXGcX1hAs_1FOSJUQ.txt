4	Just inside of Bellagio, this is a Omega Boutique store fully stocked with only Omega watches.  I was able to see the full selection and some, if not all the gold watches.  They had a white gold one that was beautiful.  Wish I could afford a gold watch!
5	Omega appears to be moving to distribute all products via this company store boutique format. No radical price discounts but very friendly and professional staff. Worked with Joseph. Was able to find a very rare new Speedmaster model here and nowhere else.
1	I was disappointed in the service I received. Unfortunately, there are no other official Omega shops in town and I wanted to have my watch serviced directly with them instead of by a third party. The staff on the night I went in seemed short-tempered, pre-occupied with the other, singular, and seemingly-more-important customer in the store (all three of the staff were waiting on him), and when I finally interjected and asked to be helped I got the girl who apparently doesn't speak english. If she does, she wouldn't speak it to me and I don't understand Chinese. Absolutely unacceptable for a brand of this caliber.
