5	I was extremely pleased with the service my kids received at this office. Very friendly and patient with my daughter whom was a bit nervous. I would absolutely recommend this office to anyone looking for a kids dentist!!
5	Been taking my kids here for years. They always bring up "I need to get my sealants done" it's hilarious. I'd highly recommend them
5	I have been taking my two girls to Dr. Lalande since we moved to Las Vegas 3 years ago. She is so friendly and always explains what is going on to my girls so they are not scared. The office is so clean and the staff are always nice and welcoming. My youngest needed some work done when we first moved here and she was great about making sure she was comfortable before beginning. I recommend this doctor to all of my friends with kids and I know of several that have switched to her. They all love her as well!
5	I love this place. I'd highly recommend anyone with children to come here. Great customer service, the doctor and assistant are the sweetest. Kid friendly and no waiting time.
5	Been taking my daughtwr here for 2 years always excellent service and my daughter loves them.
5	Doctor Carla Lalande is very good.  Her office staff well they're very good but I would like to give a big shout out  to Jasmine the young lady that handles the insurance approval . She really went above and beyond for me with my new dental insurance and I appreciate it very much. Keep up the good job Jasmine you're awesome.
