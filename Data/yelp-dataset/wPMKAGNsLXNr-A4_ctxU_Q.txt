3	Gotta love 50 cents Wing Wednesday...smothered in their signature sauce of your choice. I love the spicy Buffalo Burnin' Hot wings. It's so spicy it will make your head spin. Just the way I like them. We also ordered the Super Supreme and Meat Lovers pan pizza which was loaded with toppings. Great Pizza Hut locations.
4	This Pizza Hut location offers fast delivery & great service. I was surprisingly impressed with the wings. The flavor was notable and the pizza is always carbalicious. I like to pretend adding more vegetables makes it better for me. Thanks for always piling on the toppings & drawing an Octopus on my wing box! (It was a special request, and they nailed it!)
1	Ordered days in advanced to have it done by a specific time and there was a 10 minute delay.  A dozen people came in after me and had speedy service I definitely won't be going back. Ill stick with papa John's.
1	Just ordered and waited 1.5 hours before I called back for them to say they canceled my order because "they knocked and called three times. And waited 10 min." 1) I live in a mobile home and have dogs that bark like crazy when they hear a knock, I have no voicemails, no missed calls, and NO PIZZA!  PISSED
