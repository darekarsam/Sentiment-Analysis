3	They do gorgeous, creative flower arrangements! Delivered on time with great effects. I was pleased with the service, but it certainly helps if you speak french. The results are good. Give them an idea of what flowers you want used and style, modern, traditional, etc.. Prices are in line with what other florists charge, but look for less costly flowers or bring your vases to save money.
4	I am usually not big on flowers, either giving or receiving, but last summer I was stuck in another country on my mother's birthday. Catastrophe! What to give?! Flowers seemed a good option since they could be easily delivered to her. I really appreciated that a member of the Fauchois staff took the time to discuss the arrangement with me over the phone (international call and all!). My mother was ecstatic, and so were her workmates. From then on Fauchois has been the family's florist!As the previous review mentions, they function mostly in French which can be a drawback. Another drawback is the price, these guys are pretty steep, a minimalist small bouquet will easily set you back 40$! The really stunning bouquets are easily 70$ up.
5	Just phone Feb 25, 2014.  The arrangement was huge, very beautiful; artfully done, and the price was very reasonable.  English was not a problem - even over the phone.  Delivery was in the time frame I asked for (unfortunately the recipient wasn't home); and they phoned and made arrangements for another time.
