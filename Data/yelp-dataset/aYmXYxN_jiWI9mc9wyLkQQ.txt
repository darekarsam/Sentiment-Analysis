5	It's a bank! With ATM's and everything! Get cash whenever you want! Seriously though, the times I've actually been inside, the employees were all very helpful and nice.
1	I would give no stars but since I had to give one, one is all they get. After working with the loan department, I have decided to pull our money and move our mortgage. We were approved for our re-finance and then canceled at the last minute once they found out I was working a contract job. We have been a 20+ year B of A customer, currently have our mortgage with them and never have defualted. Yes i was laid off work like 1/2 of America but have managed to keep working a contract position. The contract jobs out here in California usually run for three months at a time and after each quarter, they extend them. I have been at my job since August 2011 and I am due to be extended at the end of June. However they used this as a reason not to go through with our loan. You think  Bank of America would want to help us make it easier to get through the economy crisis. Just to let you know I am speaking about the Loan Department in Chandler Arizona. Not only did they take forever to get the paperwork done, they called and told us to return documents as soon as possible so that our approved loan will get completed. We were told we could sign the paperwork while we were on vacation but never heard anything. Got home and found out they canceled our loan. Never will I use this Bank. Their commitment to customer service sucks.
