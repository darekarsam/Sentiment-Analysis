1	After a personal call and lengthy discussion on me wanting something unique and different and not a standard vase of flowers in our school colors of white and blue, I was asked if a unique container would be ok and I said that is what I wanted unique and different, from cheerleaders to the other cheer coach, for $100. When I saw that it was a vase of a few blue and white flowers, I was furious and feel ripped off!!! The order my family placed online was so awesome!! A puppy made of flowers in a ceramic pumpkin candy dish!! It was not even $60 including se day shipping!! The photos on his website have several larger arrangements made for $65-85!!! I sent several emails with photos comparing the two and have not received a reply back!! I will be calling!BUYERS BEWARE!!!! I guess he thought I would not see then!!
1	Used him a long time ago and to this day I still feel ripped off. Swore up and down to me he could do a job and came up short. very short. Then had the nerve to blame me.Now he has the nerve to stay open.Hate this place!
5	Happy New Year!  I appreciate great small businesses and one always receives excellent attention at Leone's. For many years, I have called from a long distance to this local florist and have always been given the best attention and service. Ron knows it's important to pay attention to the details and get it right the first time. My family and friends who live in the Shadyside area know Ron is the go to florist. Call and talk because you will be happy you did !
