5	The new location is huge! Been bringing my dogs to Grand Paws for a couple years. Very sweet staff, good follow up, in and out appointments!
5	I have been going to Grand Paws for several years. The staff are all friendly and helpful. All Vets are nice but I really like Dr. St Clair. He is very caring and good with my cats.I think their prices are better than most places. Their new clinic is very nice and I like the bigger space.
5	I've brought my animals to Grand Paws for going on four years. Dr. Sink has taken superb care of my cats the entire time. He, the other doctors, and the entire rest of the staff have helped me and my kitties with everything from vaccines to intestinal tumors. They're not the kind of vet that's just in it for the money; you can tell they actually care about their patients. I can't emphasize enough just how caring and compassionate they are about what they do! I refer absolutely everyone I know to them. I've recommended them to parents and friends alike and have never heard about a single poor quality visit. Thanks Grand Paws for all that you do!
5	I was so impressed with this practice from the moment we walked in the door... Our friends who have pets just raved about the practice.. First is the friendliness of the staff at check in... You can tell they are happy employees... A very warm environment and the technicians were FANTASTIC... Our Vet was as good as it gets...We were so comfortable instantly and they took all the time to heal our precious dog...As a professional as it gets....they love what they do... and it shows...Evidently a number of the Vets came out of early retirement because they just love it... which is a perfect match for us...  Everything is "word of mouth" You will not be disappointed.
