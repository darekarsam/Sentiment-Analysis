3	Good burgers. Paid $12 bucks for a bacon cheesburger, fry and drink. Won't be doing that too often.
4	Ahhh, thinking about those little bacon cheeseburger makes my mouth water! I seriously love to go to Five Guys ( even though I only saw 3 guys and 1 girl).  they are usually nice, cool, and make pretty awesome hotdogs and burgers. However I got one problem, they open at 11am, and I usually crave for burger in the morning since its more efficient of me to buy it early then go I work, other than that problemo, they make awesome foods!
1	Charging restaurant prices for fast food : $11 for a plain burger and fries cooked THEIR WAY -well done - or the hwy.  The kids working behind the counter were very nice but there's nothing they could do about it.Consumers (including Yelpers ) seem to hold low expectations for their money.
2	Very friendly and clean.  Usually a go to place to eat... but will not go back to this particular restaurant.  My burger was undercooked.... and had a weird smell and taste?  not sure what to think????? Left unhappy and hungry!
4	I ended up trying this Five Guys again due to a large family outing and I was pleasantly surprised by the burger being good!!  All eight people agreed the food was good!
