4	Had a nice stay. Although it's "airport" area I only saw one plane and never heard one my entire two day stay. Location is about 10 minutes south of downtown (even if you stay off the highway) and is near plenty of shopping and eating options. There were several hotels in this park-like area but ESA had the best rate and the added kitchenette was a plus. The room was clean and refurbed not too long ago. TV reception was off but a call to the front desk had it fixed the next day. Smallest of gripes - no shampoo. Now I'm sure it may be available upon request but my overnight travel kit is devoid of any TSA snafus such as 3oz liquid bottles needing a see through bag. A nearby Walgreens gave me a larger variety from which to choose :-)
4	Quiet, clean and affordable hotel. Stayed for 2 days for a Ford Mustang convention and I arrives at 1045am. Guest service agent said I would have to wait until 12:30 to check which wasn't an issue. I went to my event, came back to the hotel around 4, checked in and relaxed. Very clean and quiet. My room was in the back of the property which I didn't mind. Highly recommended this location to those looking for a affordable,  clean and convenient stay. Downtown Charlotte is a quick 15-20 mins away, with stop lights .
2	Front desk service was awful. The two people behind the counter barely acknowledged me. The room was decent though the bed was horrible and felt like an inflatable mattress. The towels are tiny and could be used as sandpaper and to top it off there is no weather stripping around the front door. Cold air and cigarette smoke came in all night. There are plenty of great hotels in the area, this is not one of them.
