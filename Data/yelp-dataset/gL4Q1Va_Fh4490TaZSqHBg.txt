5	After my neighbors got tan exterior home paint oversprayed onto my freshly painted white cutlass, these guys at Collision Bay worked to make it sparkle and shine like new again.  Thanks to Omar and the guys at Collision Bay my car looks right again.  If you have any problems I highly recommend coming to these guys.
5	My car has several blemishes, ranging from minor to fairly major.   Collision Bay fixed them like new in the time Omar said he would with no hidden charges.   It is like new again.   I couldn't be happier.   Omar made it really easy for me.   He is very honest from the start.   I hope I never have to go there, but if I need a body shop it would be Collision Bay.......No second thoughts........Thanks...
5	My car needed to get repainted and fixed up after a minor accident. And these guys were so open arms and helpful. When came in. I was a little nervous.  But after talking with them, I was comfortable. I had to come back because I seen a little imperfection and they had absolutely no problem on fixing it.
5	Great experience! Someone vandalized my car and these guys made sure my car was fixed that day and quick! The staff was so friendly. I plan on going back to get a dent fixed which they explained to me and estimated on the spot. Will follow up
