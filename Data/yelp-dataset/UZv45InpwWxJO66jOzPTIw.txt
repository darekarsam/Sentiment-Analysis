5	This is my kiddies dentist. Little to no wait time ( which I love! )They're very professional, friendly and do great work. I highly recommend coming here.
5	Dr. Bui and the staff at Dedicated Dental are rock stars. I have extreme anxiety when it comes to dentists dating back to some extreme procedures I had done as a young child. From the front desk to the dental chair, everyone is friendly, funny, and well trained. Also a lot of fun to relax and watch Netflix while I'm getting work done. Had crowns, fillings, and a deep cleaning and it was all painless.
5	Dr. Bui and his staff gets nothing but 5 gold stars, would have given 10 if I could, his work is amazing, and is a Picaso in the dentist field. So glad I found him and his office and would never use another dentist.
