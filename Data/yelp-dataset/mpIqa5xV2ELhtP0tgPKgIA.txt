4	I've never been pregnant and my biologist friend tells me I never will be.Disappointing irrelevance aside, Pretty Pregnant is a nice maternity clothes and accessories  shop in the New Town of Edinburgh, very near the city centre. A lot of the women shopping in here were pretty pregnant. So it's a good thing that they could pick up a good range of affordable maternity clothes. Apart from everyday clothes they offer formal wear, party oriented clothes and swimwear.Pretty Pregnant also often has sales on. When I was in there, there was an up to 70% sale! They also have a good website and blog (if you're really that obsessed with the whole being pregnant thing). You can also view and order from the website.
