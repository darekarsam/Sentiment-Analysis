5	Many of you may not know this, but on the top floor at the Montreal Forum there is a great treasure! It's NOT just your average sportsbar! There are many, many TVs tons of comfy seating and not only could you get some bowling in, but you can also play pool, or check out the arcade downstairs! The chef serves some really good pub fare here and the staff is friendly and accommodating! If you are ever looking for a place to hang out and watch any sports games, this is a great bet!
4	This place is huge. It spans three levels, and has a game area, pool table room, bowling, and big screens.I've been here for a few events, and had good times. For any big event, this place will fill up, so get there early if you want a seat.I haven't had much of the food here, but it seems like pretty standard sports bar fare - good enough to have with a beer while watching two guys beat the crap out of each other.I gave them an extra star for showing this year's AFL (Australian Football League - it's Australian Rules Football) Grand Final. I think they do it every year, but this one was made all the more sweeter by my Sydney Swans winning!
