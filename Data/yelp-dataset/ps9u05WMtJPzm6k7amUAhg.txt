5	I had several estimates on solar screens, really liked the guy because he made all his solar screens himself. He wasn't the cheapest but he beat the lowest offer after, I called him back. Installation was flawless his guys were very professional and they had some tight spaces to work with. I went with the 90% coverage, AC used to run full time now it doesn't kick on until 1 pm.His administrative assistant was also very with the tax and rebate information. Overall a great experience with excellent customer service.
5	Tom at Atomic Solar Screen is a great guy. We have done quite a few Solar Screens now with him and his company and we are impressed! Very reasonable with pricing and build/install time frame. I called several other solar screen places here in Las Vegas and found them to be too expensive or they were just short/rude on the phone. Right now, I have an order with Tom for 7 more solor screens and he gave me a great price and said build/install would be in 1-2 weeks max. Again, highly impressed with Tom at Atomic Solar Screens.....give him a call!
5	I had a few estimates for solar screens. I really liked how when Tom came out for the estimate and he had all his credentials. They were not the cheapest, but I really appreciated how honest he seemed.They came out for the estimate , ordered the screens and then took payment after they were installed. I couldn't believe it!!! That is good business, making sure the customer is happy and then taking the payment.His office assistant  is the best also! So pleasant and helpful!They have been in business a while and come highly recommended, I can see why! Great overall experience with them!
