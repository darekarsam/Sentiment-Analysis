2	An acquaintance of mine convinced me to have a drink here. When I got to the top of the stairs I wish I had refused. This wasn't the worst the bar I've ever been to, but one that I will never return to again! This just isn't my crowd, and if this is your crowd, you need a new crowd.
4	It's a house club, and a respected one at that. If you don't like house music, deep house, electro house, chicago house, you probably won't find what you are looking for here. Daome used to be an actual apartment, and it's been refurbished a bit since then but is still small with comfy couches, old lamps and tiki art. It's chill to lounge in when it's quiet (ie; before 1am-ish.) You can hear each other talk, djs start around 10pm, well drinks are $6 for basic booze - you could do a lot worse. The sound quality is warm and well-suited to house, and the mirror above the dj booth gives a nice view on the good work going down. Fun, not fancy, shared bathrooms, a place to check out if you're looking to cut a rug around Mount Royal.
2	Looking at the review we thought it will be a blast but it turn out boring. We love house music but the DJ was crap. I guess it was a bad night because of the DJ. The place is unique and people are friendly. The drink wasn't bad and average in price. I wouldn't mind giving a try with a better DJ.
4	The place to be on a Wednesday night.  Best soulful Afro Latin Deep house with a twist at the end of the night. Oasis Wednesdays it is!
