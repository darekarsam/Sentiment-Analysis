5	Why the heck do I even write a review on a gas station?First of all, they don't pump my gas. They don't hand me my coffee.  Heck, their video poker machines don't even let me win.  This place is my first stop before work and sometime before I hit the city.  Usually for  coffee or an energy drink.  But what sets this place above anyone in my book is their service.  I'm always greeted when I walk in.  If lines get long inside, they always manage to open another register.  But even better, they once helped me when I locked my keys, phone, and wallet in my car.  They weren't allowed to let me use the phone inside, so one of the employees let me use his cell. He was even off and ready to go home, but was kind enough to wait until I got my calls in.  Dear Ann Road Chevron,    Don't be suprised if you receive a Christmas card from me.  Thanks for everything.
2	Car wash service is terrible. I've gone to this car wash so many times and paid for the "ultimate" wash. Every day between 9-5 there is supposed to be a service man who is outside the car wash entrance that will pre wash your car then hand dry it off. They are hardly ever around like they're supposed to be. I've even gone so far as to wait outside for them and call into the store to request they come out. They never show up. Out of ten times I go they might actually pre wash my car once. The actual machine that washes your car is fine... Good thing it's always there, only reason they're getting two stars.
3	It seems like every time I go here, which is a lot cuz it happens to be in my area, their pumps are broken!Wtf mate!
