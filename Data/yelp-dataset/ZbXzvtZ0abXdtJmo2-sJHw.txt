5	I've been a patient for about 3 years now and each visit just gets better each time. The dental assistants are always friendly and help put you at ease even when that big bright light is the last thing you want to see not to mention those instruments (oh horror!). Dr. Ben Truong's friendly demeanor and professionalism also greatly reassure you when discussing your treatment plan and options.
5	In the past few years of my experience in coming here, here are the two things that never fail. 1. The staff is wonderful! Very nice, courteous and professional.2. Dr. Truong is hilarious and really wants to make sure that all his patients get the best of their experiences here. Since coming to AC Dental I have yet to say any thing bad.
1	Horrible just horrible. Aren't they suppose to clean your teeth? I hate going to businesses with lazy workers. The Doctor is lazy. Go elsewhere for better work.
