5	Very good frozen yogurt and a great selection of toppings. We have lived around the country and love frozen yogurt. This place rates up there with the best of them. Family run and they remember us every time we come in. This is a must visit if your looking for some frozen yogurt or gelato.
5	This is definitely my favorite dessert place to go, not only do they have frozen yogurt but they have gelato that you can add different flavors to, my favorite is root beer! They have a much better selection of toppings compared to the other places around (like Zoyos). The staff are super friendly and helpful, plus they have a punch/loyalty card!
5	I am from California and was visiting a friend who took me here.  Nice vibe and met the owners who were extremely nice. Good people + good product = great experience.  Keep it going!
4	Took the family here for a late treat.  It is set up so you pick your ice cream/gelato/frozen yogurt and the selection was not huge.  There were a few to choose from for each type of frozen delight.  They do have a twister thingy that you can a variety of flavors to the ice cream. Once you have you're cup filed then you add you're toppings.  There wes a good variety of toppings to choose from.  then you are charged by the ounce.
