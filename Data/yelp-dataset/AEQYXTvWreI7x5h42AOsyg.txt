2	The first time I walked into this "Greek" restaurant I looked at a chalkboard full o lunch specials. None of the specials were Greek!The food was tasty, and the waitress was very friendly, but my expectations were not met. :(
5	I have been there like way over 50 times it is great place for the money
2	Tired and hungover? Want to have breakfast in a jiffy so that you can go back to bed? This is the place for you!I've only ever been here for breakfast and in varying degrees of alertness, and the staff at Omega give me a little boost on my way to feeling normal again in under an hour. There are various omelettes, pancakes, and melts, but when you need a quick fix and value for your money, the bronze, silver, gold and platinum breakfasts are the way to go. They are iterations of the same theme: two eggs, increasing amounts of breakfast meats, toast and potatoes. Although I would love to go for gold, silver is my go-to. I suggest forgoing the usual breakfast meats and order the polish sausage. The whole table had meal envy when my silver platter came with delicious garlicky slices of polish sausage. That's always a good sign that you picked the perfect dish. The staff is warm and friendly. The service is quick. And the coffee was free flowing. When it's the morning after a super fun night, what more do you need?
5	This is one of my favourite restaurants in town. The food is good and a reasonable value, but the best thing is the wonderful service. This is a family business and it is obvious that they care about their business and customers. The turkey dinner is fantastic!
2	Only been in once all I have to say its ok nothing even remotly worth going again for, over price soda at 2.75 had gyro with french fries(frozen kind). Decor is nice wait staff also friendly ended up costing me 15$ for something that was worth half that.
