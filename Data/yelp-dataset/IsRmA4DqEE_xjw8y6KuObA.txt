5	You've never had CMU food until you've had food from the Moonlight truck!!  Seriously, their food is so consistent that every time everything taste exactly the same.  You can order broccoli and beef, vegetarian chow mien or cashew chicken and they all taste the same.  It has 1 pot of oil for frying, one wok for stir frying and 1 soy base sauce and everything goes through all three.  When you get your lunch box, be sure to check your reflection and fix your hair from the grease on the food.  It is as good as artery clogging greasy Chop Suey can get.
4	These trucks (moonlight and sunshine) are a fantastic choice for on campus dining, definitely worth the walk. They are the two trucks closest to the corner in the line of trucks permanently parked behind campus. As always, I usually get the Pho. The quality of the soup seems to vary day by day. Sometimes it is fantastic, some days a little bland. Even at its worst it is better than the on campus dining options. The price is also very reasonable.
5	there's no better pho in pittsburgh, and if you are going to say my mom makes the best...well then send a bowl over and I'll yelp a review for her.Even turtle tower in SF is crap in a bowl compared to Pho in a TRUCK, in a TRUCK!cheap food and greasy?? how dare they!! expect whole grain organic foods for the price of a hotdog?well good luck with that
