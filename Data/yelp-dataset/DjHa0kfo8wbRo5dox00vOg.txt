3	This place gets busy.  You have to hit the place at the right time to avoid the wait.  As as "walk in" I usually am in and out in less then 20 minutes for labwork and blood draw.  I usually show up on a Saturday morning, or on one my "off" Fridays in the morning.  They are very professional and well mannered.
