3	A-OK enough that no one else wants to review this just-what-it-sounds-like History of Wells Fargo Museum.  If you are interested in the History of Wells Fargo you may want to check this place out.  Bet it will never again be as busy as it was for the Grand Opening this past Saturday.  Though I am very thankful for Wells Fargo Sponsoring the Community Celebration, where all of our Uptown Museums were FREE!
4	Had a private event here in the evening, and I really enjoyed it. It's a nice little place full of Wells Fargo an Wachovia history, so of you're interested in seeing how banking has evolved through the past 100 years this is a nice stop. It's not too big, but has enough to do to keep kids and adults entertained for about an hour. I really enjoyed the picture spot in front of a real stagecoach. The museum has a digital camera that will email you a copy of the photo, as well as prints out a hard copy to take. You can also 'put your face on money' at another photo station, pan for gold in a tabletop touch-screen game, and ride in a stagecoach with scenes of wilderness rushing by.  There's also a small 'coin operated' stagecoach kiddie ride that only requires the push of a button to operate, which would be really cool if I was about 25 years younger :-) .
4	WELLS FARGO HISTORY MUSEUMCome to the museum for a taste of history of one of America's oldest banking institutes. Take pictures and even ride in one of the classic Wells Fargo stage coaches and learn all about how they were used as transportation across the nation, alluding outlaws with rifle messengers, etc. The museum boasts many exhibits that portray Wells Fargo's extensive history, from past to present. See how life was back in the 1850s... and notice how banking has changed from the 19th Century to the 20th Century. It's  small museum, but it's fun for everyone!
4	For free it is a great 1/2 hour thing to do.  Interactive and will email and print photos you can take there.  We two adults had fun
