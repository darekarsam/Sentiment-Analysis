5	I've been going to Amber for several months now. I see her for all services. She uses 3 different colors and the final product comes out amazing. I have naturally curly hair which is how I found her. My cuts are always great weather she styles it straight or leaves it curly. Definitely recommending her to my friends and family.
5	Amber is a great hairstylist.  She cuts and colors my hair, which I have never been disappointed with her work. Sometimes I just let her just do her magic and let her make the decision on what to do with my hair. I highly recommend her. You will not be disappointed.
5	I just love Amber! She was the first stylist I began seeing when I moved to Las Vegas about 2 years ago and I won't see anybody else. She is so talented and my hair always looks so great!! I typically get a mini trim and some fresh blonde ombre highlights, and I never leave disappointed. I highly recommend Amber to all my family and friends, and to anyone looking for a quality stylist. You will love her!
5	I had my haircut by Amber today and it turned out great!!! She's super sweet and she listened to exactly what I wanted done.  She has a great personality. I truly love my new haircut!! Thanks Amber!!! I'm looking forward to seeing her next month to get some new color
