5	This is a very sexy and well curated store of mens fashions and accouterments.  If I lived in montreal it would be dangerous for me because I would probably shop here a lot, especially since Cafe Myriade's new Mile-End location is inside this shop and one of my two favourite Montreal bagel spots is 2 doors down.
1	Silly overpriced place run by trust fund baby hobbyist hipster and frequented only by his like. FYI Any of the goods can be purchased cheaper on line
