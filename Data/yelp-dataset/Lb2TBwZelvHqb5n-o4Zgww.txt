3	There was an enormous selection of craft beers. Things we have never heard of and all of the favorites that we love. Biggest disappointment: almost $20 for a six pack and nearly the same to fill a growler. We love the idea of wide variety and love that it's within walking distance but we will most likely opt for giant eagle market districts new beer cafe.
5	Really like this place! Great selection, staff know their beer, prices are better than some other local bottle shops. Love the old building, too.
4	I'm a big fan of this place.  I like stopping in every week or so to see what selection they have.  There are so many varieties of beer from all over the place.  The prices aren't bad compared to several other places I have been too.
4	Absolutely LOVE this concept! We love mix and match six packs but sometimes the selection at other places can be limited. Not here! I love how they separate the beers by type and have an always-changing seasonal selection. Each bottle is priced separately but reasonably so. Any mix and match 6-pack automatically gets $3 off the total price.  Personally, I only wish they offered more gluten free beers that are not ciders.
