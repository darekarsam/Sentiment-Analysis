5	The best and most important thing about Clean Interiors is that, in addition to great service and thorough, good work, they use green products that leave nothing behind except a clean carpet.  After Dan left our house, there was no cleaning product odor and the carpets were really renewed.Dan also found some wax in the carpet, and quickly and efficiently removed it.  The overall cost was as quoted, and we're totally happy with the results.  I look forward to calling Clean Interiors again for periodic deep cleans.
5	Great service, I am happy with the job they did. Dan showed up on time and in about 1.5 hours the carpet in all of my rooms was done. He was very thorough and cleaned all of the areas, including bedroom closets. He moved some of the furniture that was in the way. As recommended, I left the AC on and the next day the carpet was completely dry. I wanted my carpets cleaned because the house had that old-owner smell to it. After the cleaning, the carpet smelled fresh and the old odor was gone.
5	I just moved to Pittsburgh, and I wanted my carpets cleaned before I got all my furniture. There were a few options on the internet, and Clean Interiors (though only 2) had the best reviews. I checked their website, and I love that the company was run by a local couple.I called and left a message, and my call was answered promptly. They were able to fit me in in two days, which was a relief. I described how many rooms and areas I needed cleaned and got a reasonable quote. The appointment was automatically entered into my Google calendar, which was convenient.Dan called to confirm the day of and came with one other helper. They came with the machine in the van, and the hose was hoisted to my 3rd story window. Clean Interiors finished the work promptly and also gave me some booties to wear as well!I was very satisfied with the result and the friendly service. Definitely recommend!
