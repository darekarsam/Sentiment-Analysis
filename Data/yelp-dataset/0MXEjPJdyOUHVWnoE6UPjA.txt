5	These people are amazing. Really who else would want to stick people with needles the size of Mcdonalds straws? Fill saddle bags for Harley's with warm blood.... all day long. The people from the front desk all the way to the needle poker are all great. The place was clean adn the wait was short!
5	Great place to unload extra blood cells to be recycled into someone else!
5	Friendly staff that tries to get you I and out as fast as possible. Appointments are the best since there are time restrictions that limiters the number of people that can be done.
5	My time to donate blood and this was my first time at this location. Very nice facility and the staff was great at making me feel comfortable and explaining the process. As a foodie, when I saw that if I gave a Max donation I would receive a free Carl's JR burger so I accepted the challenge! The offer is for this month only (August 2014) and type O is in great need. If you are type O (or any other type) head to your nearest United Blood Service and donate the max and get your coupon for a burger. I am the universal donor (O-) so I am going to give three times a year. Pay it forward!!
5	So I got past my fear of needles and decided to see what this giving blood thing was all about.  I've been 3 times now and will keep going back.  It really doesn't hurt but for a few seconds.  Most of the time they get you in and out pretty quick.  Everybody is really friendly and knowledgeable.  They understand that your experience there has a lot to do with repeat visits.  I did not know my blood type when I started.  Turns out I am O- which is a universal donor.This is review 500 for me and I couldn't think of another business more worthy of it.  They do a wonderful job of helping people help others.
