4	Having been fucked over by U-Haul one too many times, I passed over their convenient downtown locations and headed out to the airport for a recent move.  This is how truck rental should be done.  Quick, efficient, clean, reasonably priced. And they had the advantage on U-Haul in that they actually had trucks available.  One caveat: moving season in Madison is August and this rental was in November.  That might account for the ease of the transaction.
