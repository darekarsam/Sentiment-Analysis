1	Co-workers and I ordered pizza as we were working thru lunch.  Ordered at 10:22am for a 11:30am delivery.  Called at 11:50am to find out where our pizza was.  Was told it was in transit.  Pizza arrived at 12:00pm.  Pizza was barely warm.  Usually have no issues.
1	I ordered from this location last night around 10:15. I got a medium pizza (the works) and the bacon cheese breadsticks. About an hour after eating a few slices of each I began to feel sick but didn't think anything of it. However, by 1am I was curled up next to the toilet until 9am. I threw out the rest of the food and vow to never order from this location again. In fact, this incident has completely ruined the entire restaurant for me. I hope this location gets it together before they wind up hurting someone even worse.
