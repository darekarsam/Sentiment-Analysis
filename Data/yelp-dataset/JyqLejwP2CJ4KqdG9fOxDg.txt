1	As a former starbucks barista I know only to expect the best from starbucks but this particular location is my least fav the drinks always taste bad and i leave unhappy so i gave them a few trys and each time they failed so i will no longer visit this location.
2	I enjoy a soy misto.... but I feel like it how much I enjoy it depends on who is making it.... This Starbucks is pretty hit & miss with their baristas! Not everyone can be a barista... There's a guy that works at this location & he should be making the drinks every time because they always turnout out "PERFECT".... I know by who's making the drink if it is going to be good or not... At at $4+ a drink it sucks if its not good..... Come on Starbucks... figure.... it..... out!
5	This has been the best Starbucks I have been to in the Valley. They're nice, consistent, QUICK, and have never been hesitant to do the right thing.
5	This is the best Starbucks I've ever been to. I just moved here from Alabama, and being a Starbucks fan I have been to A LOT of them, but this is my absolute favorite. All of the workers are so polite and sweet, and always doing their best to go as fast as possible. I've been going there every other day just about since I moved here a month ago, and today my debit card wasn't working so I was buying a sausage biscuit with what little cash I had, and the sweet cashier was like we're going to give you your usual drink too, no worries, it's on us. Wow, that was so kind. Also, once I had to wait a little bit for my biscuit so I went up to check on it, and they gave me a card for a free drink next time just for my wait. Super nice workers. No better customer service anywhere!
4	Can't go wrong with the passion iced tea.
5	My standard starbucks.  Always quick. Always efficient. Always friendly. Get me in and out and back on the way to work without any hassle which is the way stopping for a morning cup of coffee should be.
