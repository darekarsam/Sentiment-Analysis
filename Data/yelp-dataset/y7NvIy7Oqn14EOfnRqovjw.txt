4	Looked a long time for such a great cleaning service! Elite Maid has been cleaning my home for over 6 years now. The ladies are polite, meticulous, flexible, great at the job. They come with a crew of 3 so that they get in, work hard. The service charge is very fair. I highly recommend Elite Maid.
5	I have been using Elite Maid Service for 7+ years. Anthony, the owner, is very easy to get in touch with and the same ladies clean my home each week. They are reliable,  conscientious, and willing to go above and beyond their normal cleaning duties when asked. I would highly recommend Elite Maid Service to anyone looking for a reasonable cleaning service with hardworking and trustworthy ladies.
1	First time using their service. Anthony obviously does not want to have more customers. Cleaning has not been done properly and I have been told that my house was filthy...I honestly have the cleanest house in the whole neighborhood since I have been cleaning it every week until I had to ask Elite services to come and do it for me. I shared my remarks and explained that I will give it a try again, but Anthony told me that I can find another cleaning company.....Good to know that he does not need customers. Very rude guy honestly. Poor services.
