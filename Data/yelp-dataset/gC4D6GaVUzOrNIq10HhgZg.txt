5	This review is for the new location on South Rainbow.I had recently adopted a new pup for my BF that was in desperate needbof some TLC.  Being that Bruno is deaf, I was concerned that he would be very uncomfortable being groomed and that a groomer wouldn't give him the extra TLC he needs.The groomers at Noah's were wonderful!  They did a fabulous job with Bruno and wow, barely recognized him when I picked him up.  He looked so happy and quite handsome.I've tried numerous groomers in the past for my two pups and have never been happy.   That's absolutely changed now.   I love Noah's and will be bringing all my pups here from now on.
1	ATTENTION! PLEASE DO NOT BRING YOUR DOGS TO THIS SALON! THEY ARE NEGLIGENT!!!!!!!!!We our dog Katie brought to the store last friday for grooming and the groomer left her on the table unattended and she jumped, strangling herself and DIED!!!!!!!!!!! They did not offer any retraction and don't even want to talk to us and now the owner keeps changing his story on how the dog came to die. PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD SO WE CAN PUT THESE PEOPLE OUT OF BUSINESS!!!
