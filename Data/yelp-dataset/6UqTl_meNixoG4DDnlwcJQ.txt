4	I love this store. It was a "pleasant" surprise (PUN INTENDED). We walked in and caroused around the store for quite a bit. The place has all types of "goodies", penis shaped pasta (in case you get hungry for more than just the marinara), grow your own man/woman, tons of magnets, post cards, more "extravagant" gifts for your ow person as well as pretty much anything else you can imagine. The owners of the store also work there, which makes a huge difference, as they are friendly and willing to order/accommodate you if you need anything. The big rainbow equal rights sticker gives away the treasure cove hidden in this conservative part of townEvery time we got to Pittsburgh, I get my BOIS and we head to this cute little shop, to stock up on all my supplies. Plus one star for the alliteration in the name.
4	If you're looking for political-themed, Steeler or gag gifts, this shop is a good place to check out.  I thought the non-birthday card selection was a little small, but I'm also really particular about my greeting cards.  Like many card/gift shops, this place carries some soaps and bath products, and those Quotable Quote mugs/magnets/cards.  There's also a small toy selection, which is handy if you need a last-minute gift for a child or just someone who's, as they say, "young at heart."The owners are very friendly, but don't hover, which I appreciate since I need time to soak in all the different products in the store.  I prefer the bigger card and gift selection at Kards Unlimited over on Walnut in Shadyside, but in terms of employee friendliness, this place wins and is definitely worth checking out if you're in Squirrel Hill.
5	Unfortunately, this greatest of shops CLOSED !!! Gone for at least a year now.
