5	Joseph has been very helpful in keeping my business computer up and running at tip top condition. He's efficient and cost effective and will always take care of you. Thanks again!
5	I took Joseph up on his offer for a complimentary computer check, and to help me figure out an external hard drive issue.  In a short amount of time, he was able to clean my computer and get the hard drive functioning properly.  Even when he told me about a few things to keep an eye on or about his other available services, he wasn't pushy about it at all.  I really appreciate that.  Now everything is running perfectly.  Overall, I had a great experience working with Joseph, and would recommend him to anyone with computer needs.
5	Been using Joseph's talents in photography for the past few years, and can't give him enough praise. Always gets great shots, edits and delivers the final product for all our events the next day! Has never disappointed, and always on time. He has also always stepped in last minute to save us when other photographers flake. Would recommend him to anyone ~B~
5	Joseph is great to work with!  He has done our family photos several times and they always come out great!
