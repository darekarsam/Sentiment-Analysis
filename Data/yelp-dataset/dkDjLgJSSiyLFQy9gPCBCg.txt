3	Let's keep this short and sweet: It's a pretty clean and well kept 7-11. It's right on the corner so there is easy access and it seemed pretty well stocked. The staff was ok and service was pretty fast. I was literally in and out in no time, so that's always a bonus! In my books this place is okay.
1	Have you ever been to a gas station where there's a line full of customers and the guy behind the counter has his cell phone glued to his ear and the perception is that he would rather be talking to his friends then deal with you? That's what I experienced when I went into this 7 Eleven this morning. It's pretty hard to give people the service or even the right change when you're too busy talking on your cell phone.
