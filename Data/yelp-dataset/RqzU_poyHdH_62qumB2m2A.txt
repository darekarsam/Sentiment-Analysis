4	Great arena for hockey, concerts, and so many other events. Friendly staff, clean restrooms, and a great location for events. Love coming here to watch hockey games--Let's Go Coyotes!
2	Getting out of the Upper Deck after a Hockey game will be your first nightmare if your seats are there. Only two escalators lead down and out and the wait can be up to 20 minutes for the thousands of cheapskates. If you survive that wait then good luck exiting the shopping center parking lot. It looks like Black Friday shopping day out there. The wait to get out might have taken an hour, but luckily I entered a nearby bar and drank away the long line of brake lights. Inside the arena is a pretty good view from the Upper Deck, but didn't bother trying any food. Get VIP or figure out some way to avoid the mass crowds and it would be a better experience.
1	Going to see Trans Siberian Orchestra and had to wait forever to get in. Horrible organization and planning. It is already 30 minutes past start time.
2	Doors were supposed to open at 2. They opened two doors at 2:40 and a mad rush ensued. We waited in absolute chaos outside only to finally get in at 3:15. We then had to run to our seats through more crowded chaos only to have to wait again to enter where our seats were. Thinking it was their fault everyone was not there on time we thought for sure the show would be delayed right?  Nope, they started at 3:23. Not nearly everyone was in yet and they turned off the lights. Poor all around. From what I understand this is normal there. We won't be going back.
