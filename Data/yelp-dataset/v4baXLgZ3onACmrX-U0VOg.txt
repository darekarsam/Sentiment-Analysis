4	It's round about this McColls that you can tell you're leaving touristville and treading water into the real Edinburgh, where grinning foreigners with bumbags are make way for shifty looking youngsters, and trustafarian students share breathing space with the drunken tramps that appear to live on the benches in Nicholson Square.It's probably the best McColls I've been in, which may not be saying much, but they do go that extra mile with their stock, selling hot dogs and even (possibly) fresh cakes.On the flipside, on my past two visits here I've seen both an old woman try to pay with a fake 20, and a guy in a wheelchair buy a bottle of vodka. At 12pm.Welcome to Scotland.
