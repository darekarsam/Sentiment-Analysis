5	Tasty beers on tap, cool atmosphere and music. Came for lunch and stuffed myself silly - very generous portions for the cost! Would definitely come back again for some more BBQ ribs, fried chicken and mac n cheese. Yummo!
4	What I appreciate more than anything is effort. If a place puts in the effort you feel like your custom is acknowledged and appreciated. Its even better when the food is actually good and it's really good here. I'm a big fan of BBQ ribs and what used to be impossible to get anywhere in Edinburgh seems to be de rigueur at the moment but the ones in here are brilliant. Today I had a nice pint of Estrella and some chipotle macaroni outside in the sun on my lunch break (all served in good time for work lunches)The place itself is quirky and thankfully different from all these new minimalist places popping up that are stripped to the bare bricks and steel girders. That was done 10 years ago in London man...
5	Does what it says on the tin, an informal friendly bar ready for anyone with good food and drink at realistic prices
4	i popped into Paradise Palms for a quick drink prior to a christmas dinner.  having never visited the venue before i was pleasantly surprised by the decor (sort of tiki bar in the wild kind of theme) and the cocktail menu on offer.  i tried a sugar daddy which was lovely and had a great sour/sweet taste.  had i been there longer i definitely would have tried a few further offerings on the cocktail menu but a good place to go next time i'm in that part of town.also as a side note, the bartenders were quite dishy... so quality service for a good looking guy :)  always a positive in my book!!
