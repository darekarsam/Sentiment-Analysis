5	Okay this guy is awesome and I plan on asking him to do my wedding. I have used Jeremiah for years and I have never been disappointed. From that birthday gift to just something to say I care. he can whip up something in a heart beat and will work with your budget too.
5	This floral shop goes beyond what you might expect.  Bigger, better and less expensive.  Highly recommend!
5	I use Jeremiah on a pretty regular basis for deliveries to clients, but I recently sent a bouquet to a friend and she was kind enough to send me a picture.  Perfection!  I love what he did with my pretty vague request. Green, purple and fuchsia colors became the perfect for her arrangement!  They are always super kind on the phone and I've never heard of an arrangement going astray. I was shocked at what she received for what I spent, but in a good way.
5	WOW!  Jeremiah, you and your team went above and beyond!  From the moment we walked into your store to the day of our wedding, you exceeded all expectations.  The flowers were absolutely beautiful!  Delivered as promised, everything just as we discussed and the biggest surprise was actually seeing you after the wedding ceremony carrying the arch flowers into the ballroom for our head table decor!  I've never known a florist to deliver, set up and stay to make sure the flowers get to the reception.  We were beyond impressed and it was so much appreciated!!  Thank you for making our wedding the best day ever!
