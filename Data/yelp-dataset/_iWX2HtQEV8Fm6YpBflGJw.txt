5	Kevin, the owner of Got Tint? has done a vehicle of mine before. He does an amazing job. I took my 2 day old 2013 Chevy Silverado and he dialed me in right. I may need to go back to fix something but I know he'll take care of me. Very professional and quick. Highly recommended.
5	The owner Kevin was super cool. They got me in right away and done very quickly! My car came out perfect! I will definitely get my next car tinted here!
5	Kevin at Got Tint? has tinted 3 of our vehicles. Each vehicle displays his quality work with his skill. He offers great  prices and a variety tints. His customer service alone is worth having him do you next tint job. Highly recommended!
5	Great price and a great Job! Friendly and down to earth people. I only had my back glass tinted on my truck. Quoted me a price over the phone. Hands down perfect!
5	Had a total of 3 autos done here. It is one of the best shops I have ever been to. As far as the price goes. It is the best.
5	Kevin is hands down the best Tinter in Vegas.He did my work truck (Allstate Roofing)He is currently doing my project restoration 1985 SS El Camino. Kevin is honest and professional and I'll be damned if he isn't one of if the not the best car Tinter in the entire town. Prices fair to excellent. Quality of work Excellent to Perfect. Professionalism excellent to Superior. And the number one thing , Kevin is a honest businessman which in this town , anyone who has been here long enough, knows just how bad the service industry is.... Always a catch or switch and bait. At GOT TINT YOU WILL NOT FIND ANYTHING BUT SUPERIOR SERVICES. Thank you Kevin....
1	Wasted my time. Called first, told the guy exactly what I wanted, he said he got and he wasn't busy so come down. I drove all the way down there and dude didn't even have the tint I wanted and asked for ahead of time! What a waste of my time and gas! Know what you have in stock BEFORE you say you got it!! Now I know why he wasn't busy....
