4	I took my four year old niece to Build-A-Bear over the weekend.  It was as cute as I remembered... I went to Build-A-Bear in Los Angeles for a company event so it was much cuter to go with a child.As we were walking up to the store, a little girl was coming out and was so excited to introduce us to her new friend.  Very cute!  The people who work there were great with my niece and really made it special for her.  She had a great time picking out the animal, filling it with stuffing and love, and picking out clothes.  The prices were surprisingly reasonable.  I took one star off because it seems like the quality of the stuffed animals has gone down over the last several years.  Regardless, it's a great adventure for kids!
5	Amazing staff and always a fun experience.  We have over a dozen assorted bears and never grow tired of this experience.  Even if we just browse we are treated extra special they are great at this store!
5	This is my daughter's happy place!  Always great staff who seem to really help parents control the situation.  What I mean is instead of up selling my child and putting me in the awkward position of having to say no, they asked right up front what we were looking for and let us guide the purchase.  And they really make each child feel special.  I have been to 7 other Build a Bear locations - including Disney - and the staff here is by far the best!
