4	This is my favourite Chinese delivery - I have yet to visit their branch, but many meals have been devoured in our household already. I especially like the fact they have Ostrich as a meat option. This is healthy and tasty - if not a little more expensive. (but worth it)My favourite dishes are Ostrich Satay, Ostrich Chow Mein and their crispy duck. They are fully commit ed to using as many local ingredients as possible, yes those Ostriches are from a Scottish Ostrich Farm!Their meals are fresh and very tasty. You can also order online (via the 'justeat' website) until 10pm everydayDelivery times vary, but mostly they deliver within 30 min but elaborate dishes or large orders may take a little longer, but it has yet to be a late delivery. They are also happy to take additional meal requirements and even supply a bit of chili oil on the side if you ask them.No complaints from this happy Ostrich eater!
3	Possibly beating even Stockbridge's Ping-On for sheer variety, Newhaven (spell it right, Yelp!) Express Chinese has it all and then some. Interestingly offering even Ostrich amongst their range of meats.I opted for the Mixed Meat Red Thai Curry and Salt & Pepper Ribs. Both were good. Nothing special. Just good. I prefer my ribs to be the huge, pulled directly from the animal type, not the mini, pulled from an animal but diced up afterward type. But they were tasty.The curry could've used more sauce. A bit too thick for my preference. But all in all a good introduction and I'd be well up for giving them another crack of the whip and seeing what else they have to offer.A decent cheaper option if you don't fancy over-spending on the better-albeit-much-pricier wares of Karen's Unicorn, Silver Bowl, et al.
