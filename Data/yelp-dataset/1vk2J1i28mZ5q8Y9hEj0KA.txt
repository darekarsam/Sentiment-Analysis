5	Just had my first ever reiki experience, and thanks to Tacy, I found it very introspective and healing!  With a warm greeting and a calm and clear description of her reiki methods, Tacy was very professional and put me at ease.  She has created a very nice serene environment, and I was able to achieve very deep levels of relaxation during the session.  The session for me was similar to a deep meditation with strong energy sensations flowing through my body.  Tacy's readings of my energy were spot on and she presented them in a positive and uplifting way.  The experience left me feeling really rejuvenated with a much bigger respect and interest in reiki. I will be back!
5	Great Reiki experience! Tacy is warm and welcoming and I felt nothing but comfortable! My session was definitely the beginning to a new positive path. Plus her healing room is absolutely gorgeous! I kind of want to live in it! Thanks Tacy!
5	Blessings & Namaste,Tacy is an amazing spirit who brings an abundance of love, passion and wisdom into here energy healings. As her Teacher/Mentor I have witnessed Tacy grow from practice, determination and dedication for her passion of helping and healing herself and others on this journey called life and living. Always open for growth opportunities, she continues to raise her vibration through continued practice of spiritual techniques, learning additional healing modalities, and seeks out ways to be in complete alignment with the spirit, body and mind through meditation and channeled guidance.I am one who knows first hand of her abilities, and would recommend them to anyone in my loving circle.~Minister C.
