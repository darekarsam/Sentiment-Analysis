1	I bought a small bag of cat food here that cost me $9.67. Yes, really. Also, I asked if they sold money orders and the cashier said  'yes, but not now'. And don't ever use the ATM in the morning and expect to break a $20, you'll be told, on every visit, that they have no change. I only go here if Zach's down the street is out of something I really need. Lower your prices, train your employees, and leave some change for the morning commuters, esp as you're across the street from a busy bus stop.
