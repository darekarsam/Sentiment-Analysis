5	Wow!!! This brought back memories of tha Good Ole' Day's!!!! Awesomely Remodeled!!! Oh Yeah & They Said Its OK to 'Make It Rain'!   There would be no Crazy Horse III without Crazy Horse Too...... I mean The Horse ;) Good Times.....
5	Vegas has really been lacking a true Gentleman's Club but the rebirth of Crazy Horse Too has filed the void!  I've been to the other clubs and CH2 has the best treatment for their guests bar none.  Forget about the cool spot where your treated like dirt. The courteous and professional hosts made our night legendary. We left the rhino cuz some meat head got annoyed we were wanting a table and didn't have a black card.  Really a black card? So when we were lucky enough to find out this place was open we went right over.  You can imagine our shock at the completely different culture of hospitality they provide. We were seated at a table right away and no one tried to run my credit.  Being a local, I got 50% off my bar bill and no cover!  The girls were smoking hot and VERY friendly in the VIP! I'll never go anywhere else in Vegas again!  Thank you CH2 for bringing back a real strip club to Vegas!
1	10 years ago this place was the best club in the country. Now it's been closed down and has bums living in there, shitting and pissing all over. So sad. Best place in town now is Crazy Horse 3 on Russell Road right behind Mandalay Bay. Hottest, friendliest girls and best staff. Locals get half off drinks
