4	Dorcas is one of the best Korean restaurant in CU in my opinion. I love their combos because I always get to try different dishes. My favorite is their grilled mackerel. They give you tonnes of food as you can see from the pictures. The taste is not bad but they need to add more variety to their menu.Update: I retract my last statement. I went there again this weekend and their menu has a lot to choose from. The hot and spicy squid was really good.
4	I don't know why, but when I feel like getting Korean to go, I come to Dorca's instead of Woori Jib.  It is a little more expensive than what you would find outside of Champaign, but that doesn't stop me from frequenting this place.  You get very sizeable portions.  I always get their bbq chicken (bulgolgi's also very good, but I'm a white-meat eater) and it comes with a shitload of rice, side of kimchi, a few potstickers, some rice noodles... basically enough food to last me two to three meals.  If you don't carry out, you get free refills on soup and rice.Great, great food and fast service.  I love this place!
4	Dorcas is a very standard Korean restaurant... that Koreans actually go to! The portions are substantial, soups authentic, and banchan wonderfully served. This place reminds me of cafeterias back in Seoul, and not necessary all in a good way. The interior is clearly not meant for show, and while you know what? It makes the food stand out even better!
