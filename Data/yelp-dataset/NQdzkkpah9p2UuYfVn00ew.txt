5	I had Unique-Scape landscape my backyard. They installed a paver patio, block wall, fire pit, plants, drip irrigation system, and rocks. All the work was top quality.
1	The previous reviews must be written by the owner himself,  5 stars!!! Are you kidding.If you want to pay somone by doing a sloppy job, Unique-scape and design is good at that. Otherwise,  do yourself a favor by choosing a different company to take care of your yard.
5	I recently sent Unique-Scape over to my parents house to trim a mesquite tree and clean up the front yard. The tree is taller than the house and looks very good. I am once again a satisfied customer.I am not the owner. I found out about Unique-Scape through my homes builder (Lennar). Unique-Scape was the subcontractor that landscaped all of our front yards and I have never heard any of my neighbors complain. I have hired them twice and I look forward to hiring them in the future.
