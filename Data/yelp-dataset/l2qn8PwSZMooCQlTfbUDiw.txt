3	I like the idea of this place: sausages and microbrew. But I don't end up buying much sausage there. I don't like the sausages much. Maybe they are low-fat or something. I do like their sauerkraut. And I occasionally buy a sausage sandwich to eat across the street in the park in nice weather.

Initially drawn in by the bacon and salamis (in hopes that we could sneak something back home to the US), my dining partner and I returned for the outstanding sausage sandwiches.We both ended up getting swiss cheese infused sausages-- positively bubbling with mild, gooey cheese-- with mustard and pickles as a nod to a classic Cuban sandwich. Seeing everyone else order saurkraut we opted for a little of that too... and were stunned. This, friends, is one of the most perfect sandwiches I've ever eaten.The baguette on which the toppings were served was chewy, crunchy, and hot. The saurkraut-- something I'm not normally a fan of-- was crunchy and fresh and provided a nice mildly acidic counter to the rich, fatty sausage. Solid mustard and tasty pickles. My dining partner and I sat in silence just savoring these sandwiches.To note-- if ordering from the food cart, pay inside first and get a number. Kudos to the friendly clerk willing to make us sandwiches even though we hadn't done this formality before stepping in line.Anyhow, I'll be hiding in my kitchen trying to figure out how to recreate these delights.
