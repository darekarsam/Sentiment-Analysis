5	My name is Marcelo Falconi, I have known Valentina since 2009, she helped me with the purchase of two properties, a house and a condo. Valentina was able to find me the best deal possible both times, she invested a lot of time in both of these deals. She is the most diligent and efficient realtor I've ever known, I strongly recommend her for any real state need anybody may have.
