5	Very good experience here. The staff is friendly and very helpful, prices are competitive with big box stores without compromising quality, and the turnaround time beats anyone else I've seen in Madison. It's also a locally owned business, which is important to me. I'll definitely be returning here with my framing from now on.
5	I had a very good experience here.  I'd previously been going to a big box store that starts with the letter M, for no particular reason other than I thought I might get a good price there.  U-Frame It is definitely competitive when it comes to price, but the staff and frame selection gives them an edge.  I just had an oil painting framed and, even though they did have to order the frame sections, they had the project done in 5 days (they estimated a week to a week and a half).  In my experience this is very fast.  They did a nice job and, in my opinion, went above and beyond.  The piece of art that I brought on was signed, dated and titled on the back of the canvass and U Frame It photocopied this information and secured it to the paper backing.  The also threw in a hanger.  Little stuff, but I appreciate the attention to detail.  Staff was helpful while I was picking out a frame (not condescending or arrogant like some places) and I think we got it just right.I'll go back.  I hear the Johnson Street location is very good as well.  I would have gone there, but they are closed on Sundays.
5	After taking my photos to countless places looking to get them framed, I visited u-frame-it after receiving a coupon and I'm so glad I did. They had the best selection of frames in the city, and their prices were far better than any of the competition. To top it all off, the lady we spoke to could not have been friendlier or more helpful. 5 stars all around.
