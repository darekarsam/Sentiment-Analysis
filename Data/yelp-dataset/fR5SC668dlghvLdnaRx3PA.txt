5	Finally! A pest control company that does exactly what they say they will do! The technician arrived to my property at the time that I had scheduled, he was extremely professional, and was very thorough in making sure that my home was serviced properly. He was also very friendly and knowledgable.  I am so glad to have found such a great pest control company in Las Vegas!
5	My home was having a wasp problem so it being a Sunday, I had very little hope for a company that would come out to get rid of the pests. Called Steve and he told me that he would come out to my house around 5pm. Total shock because again, it's a Sunday. He and his partner came out early at around 4:30pm. I told him what was going on and he did a full walk around of my house and the property. He did his magic and a swarm of about 6-7 wasps flew out from their nesting area. They sprayed around the entire property and everytime I said "there's one" they got their spray out and took care of it. They warranty their work and even informed me of their bi-monthly service. Straight forward and friendly. Would recommend them to anyone I know who needs a pest control service and they will definitely be the first company I would call if any other pests issue arise.
