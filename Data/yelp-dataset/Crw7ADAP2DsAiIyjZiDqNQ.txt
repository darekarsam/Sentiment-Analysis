3	Nice open space inside with a cheery welcome.  The soup of the day with shrimp and avocado was delicious.
3	This is not a place to trek to, however, it is a solid restaurant of the area. The food is good, though the portions are a bit larger than expected. The sangria was strong enough (that is something that is often watered down). The ambiance is dark/romantic, and on a warm day, the open atmosphere is quite nice. Nothing was too memorable, but everything was solid.
4	Really good choice if you want to enjoy a great meal in cool laid back environment. Food is great. Specials are interesting. Fish dishes are excellent. The servings of mussels are the biggest I have ever seen!  Sangria is really good too.
