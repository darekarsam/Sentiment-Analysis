2	Not a huge fan.  I got the roast beef panini and could have whipped up a better one myself.  Literally toasted bread, mustard, roast beef and cheese.  Two stars for a great locations.  People watching in Vegas is incredibly entertaining.  If you travel all the way to Vegas for vacation, save your tummy space for something yummier and more local.
4	Used to work at Peter Lik WAY up there on the 3rd floor. "There's a 3rd floor in the Forum Shops?" And thus place makes an amazing pumpkin sliced mocha (in season) and some bomb Mochas any time )
4	Best Iced Americano I've had this entire time I was in Vegas! I had the same drink over at Payards, and it wasn't nearly as good as it was from Espresso. They have quite an extensive menu of drinks, so be prepared to look at the drink menu for a little bit. Drinks are a bit pricy at $4.95 for a large Americano, but the drink was great. Staff here is ok; not the best, but not bad.
4	Pricey but cheaper than following my wife around the mall where she might spend $1,000 bucks. $10 for coffee and a tea is better and it's fairly quiet here compared to the mall where there's music everywhere!
