5	I love my daughter's coaches. Especially when they let me know she isn't doing what she's suppose to do.  My daughter has been doing gymnastics since 2 and this is my favorite spot so far.
5	This is a great place for kids to get good quality exercise at and learn discipline. Every coach here seems to be on top of their game and they all love the kids. I have been bringing my daughter here since she was 5 and she loves coming every week. I can't say enough good things about this place and the entire staff.And one night a month they have a thing called parents night out...  Drop the kids off at 6:30 and pick them up at 11:30, if course costs a few dollars but my daughter loves it and it gives me a night to see a movie or enjoy a quiet house.... Once again this is a great school and I highly recommend it....
1	I learned about this place on Groupon they had a great special and I decided to buy it. Worst mistake ever, place is dirty always smells bad, over crowded, staff is not aprochable. I do have to say her coach was nice he helped my daughter but that was not the case will all staff, then to top it off christmas event came around no proper training for the kids to participate more than 200 people in a lobby that maybe has capasity for 50 people. Do to the lack of practise provided to my child i requested my money back for the amount it cost me to enroll my child in the christmas event which was denied nor did she participate, I could not let my child attend an event where she would be scored by judges and set her up for failure. WORST Gymnastics school in town.
