4	The good thing about Starbucks is that no matter where you go, they have the same great service and coffee. This location has all the great elements that make up the Starbucks brand! Definitely be sure to stop in for an always great caffeine fix!
4	Despite the hustle & bustle of a prime student location, this Starbucks manages to serve their clientele very efficiently and without error. They don't show any contempt when people place those complicated orders during the rush and the staff have always been smiling!
2	Starbucks makes ok everything but this location was very frustrating. We arrived on a busy Saturday evening and there was one person working... and sneezing on everything... every seat was occupied by people who clearly had not ordered in a while and who were set on occupying space for the long term. I'll avoid this location moving forward.
