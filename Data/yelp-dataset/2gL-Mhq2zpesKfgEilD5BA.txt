5	Not your typical shisha bar. Lovely older couple runs the place, always friendly and very affordable. After many different locations, my friends and I have found our place. Service is in English, Arabic and French. Great flavours, and a calm relaxing atmosphere (usually never too crowded or loud). Recommend!
5	Needs more love on Yelp. Very nice cute old Egyptian couple serving good hookah in a relaxing environment.Tables and couches mostly utilized by students studying and conversing in English, French and Arabic. The husband and wife duo can speak all 3 languages and are very attentive. Quick-light coals are the default but you can pay to upgrade to square coil-heated coals.If you're looking for a relaxing place to sit for a spot of tea and some shisha before going out further, drop  by here. Note: no booze but you can bring your own food or buy the snacks they have on hand.
