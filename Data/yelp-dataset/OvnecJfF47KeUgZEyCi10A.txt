3	Marche Al Mizan ~ isn't a restaurant, but it'll help your kitchen turn into one.Located on the corner of Maissoneuve and St. Mathieu ~ Marche Mizan is not your typical depaneur.  In fact it's more akin to the local stores found all over the Middle East (Lebanon, Syria, Jordan) - in that it operates as a full grocery store despite existing in what can be best compared to a shoe-box!Pros: If you live in the neighbourhood ~ it's a great place to get fresh produce (arriving daily).  Marche Mizan distinguishes itself from other like places in the area by being very well stocked (almost overflowing).  They have a butcher in the back - very clean - and serve both Halal and Kosher meats.  Prices are very reasonable too - even by the relatively higher depaneur standards.  Lastly, they have a wide selection of fresh nuts (roasted, salted, plain) as well as dried fruits - the only place in the downtown Concordia area to do so.Cons: Crowded and often messy (too little space for too many things) ~ if you can help it don't shop around 5-6pm, that's when the rush is on.  Makes for some difficult maneuvering.Happy eating.
4	I always come to Al Mizan for international calling cards, and halal meat. Aside from that they have good spice collection for both desi and middle eastern cuisine. Their meat cuts are great for lamb and beef and they even have other body parts as well. I usually only get my meat from here but they always have good fresh produce as well. One slightly note of awe though is the 2 ladies who are always working at the counter. Amazingly enough they work incredibly fast, and by incredible I mean my bill of 60+ items done in 4 minutes max. TIME!!! yes i am wow'ed out but anyway this is a nifty store for local students nearby as its perfectly accessible from the metro.
