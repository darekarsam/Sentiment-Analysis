5	When the store moved to its new location, I followed, even though it's a further drive and I have other options closer. They carry the best all natural products at a price that is a bit cheaper than the other pet stores I tried before I found this one. Always super helpful and friendly. Definitely recommend!!!
5	Different location, same great service and products. While the space is roughly the same as the previous locale, the layout of the new space allows for easier browsing. The owner is always so nice and helpful, and it's great to find a store where each product has been specially picked for its high quality.
5	Sunflower Pet Supply ROCKS!  Beth is one of the most knowledgeable owners of a pet supply store I have EVER met!  Per our vet, our cat (17 years old) was on her "last leg,"  Had blood work drawn, and got the feedback from the vet.  Took that information to Beth for her suggestions, and guess what, our cat was lethargic, low appetite is almost like a kitten again (and STILL alive with a great quality of life 7 months AFTER the vet had said "sorry I don't have better news for you."Pricing, variety, and cleanliness at Beth's store is incredible.HIGHLY recommend this store to anyone with furry friends!
5	I've been buying from sunflower for YEARS! Beth is truly amazing and very knowledgeable. I really can't say enough good things without boring you. But check it out yourself :)
