5	Olive oils from different parts of the world, some as far away as Australia, all processed in California. The oils are all in large metal barrels and you can ask for FREE tastings, before deciding which  oil you like/wish to purchase. There are various fleur de sels and peppercorns as well as balsamic vinegars and pricey pastas. The goods ain't cheap, but this is all supposed to be "gourmet" and  high quality, hence the high prices. The locale is well -situated, in the Jean Talon Market  area,large, airy, and well-lit. The staff is friendly and California laid back, will only "help" you if you ask . Another foodie address to remember and keep.
