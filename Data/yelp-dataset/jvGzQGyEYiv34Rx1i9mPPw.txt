5	We ordered cake pops for our son's birthday parties two years in a row and had great experiences with Sal each time. The cake pops she created were absolutely adorable and fit with our themes (Baseball and Elmo). Everyone at the parties seemed to enjoy them too and it sure was less messy than cupcakes or slices of cake and perfect to hold for small hands. We met Sal when we shopped at the Central Farmers Market a few years ago. She has such a fun energy about her and she really does whatever she can do to make things work for our cake pop needs. I highly recommend you check her out at the market, try some of her flavors and discuss your needs/ideas. She also makes the container to hold the cake pops too.
5	I LOVE these cake pops!! They are always moist and yummy and Sal is the best! My youngest son can't eat food dye, that is not a problem with Cake Pops By Sal.  You can find her at the Central Farmers' Market every Sat.
