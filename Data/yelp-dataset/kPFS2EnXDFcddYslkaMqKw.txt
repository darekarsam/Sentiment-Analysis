5	I went to this spa to do a full body wax and the lady was really great she did it fast I wouldn't say I didn't feel any pain but it is the kind of pain you can handle it didn't hurt so much and she did a perfect job there was no hair left and she put some kinda cream after she finished I would defiantly  go there again
4	Service toujours aussi impecable, en plus j'ai appris qu'il y a des grandes tailles pour les robes de chambre et qu'on peut les echanger autant qu'on veut. Par ailleirs, vous avez aussi acces aux bains si vous prenez un traitement d'osteopathie!
4	Very great price, and great service.  The staff are so nice and make an effort to make your experience pleasant.   My friend and I really enjoyed our massages.  My only qualm is its a bit small and fills up fast on the weekend.  I recommend going there as early as possible.
