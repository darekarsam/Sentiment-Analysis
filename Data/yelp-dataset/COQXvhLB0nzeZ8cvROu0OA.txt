5	I have been eating at Vespuccis at least twice a week for the last few months. The food isn't bad, it's pretty much the same fare that your average Pittsburgh Central Asian pizza shop will offer you, but it's reasonably priced and the service has always been friendly. They also stock deserts from Cheesecake Factory. Don't let the other review get you down, they're worth  a try.
5	I have eaten every type of food they offer from salads to pizza and hoagies.  I have ordered more times than i can count and look forward to my next order. This is my favorite place to order from downtown and I recommend it to and guests at my work looking for best local pizza place. I have never had a bad experience from this place and the food tastes very good and homemade. They even make their own salad dressings. I Recommend to everyone!!!
