4	Very basic deli. I work close so go here often. From the street this place doesn't look like much, but once you enter... Still not much. Looks very outdated with booths and a few pictures on the wall, including beer signs although they don't serve beer. The sandwiches here are run of the mill deli sandwiches but extremely reasonably priced. They have daily specials for $3.50 for a full sub! Get a bucket of iced tea for a buck and you have lunch for under $5.00. The service is very friendly. Most of their business is regulars and they definitely let you know it. After going just a few times they had my name and order memorized. They are known for their "Little Rock Special" which is a cheesesteak, not bad but I prefer their cold subs.
2	Good bread, but steakums do not a cheesesteak make. Stick with cold subs.
4	Fast and friendly service, I am a repeat customer. There daily 4 dollar specials are a great value. A good place for a decent sub
5	This place is great for a great price. Every day there is a special which is a footlong sub for 4 bucks. Also if you get the special that day you can add the extra large drink for 99 cents! The little rock special is a Philly cheese steak with grilled opinions, lettuce, tomato, oil and vinegar and mayo. Yummy. They have many versions of the cheese steak to even include marinara sauce. Okay mouth watering now. Another good one is the little Italy, which is another daily special, basically ham, salami, pepperoni, lettuce, tomato, and oil and vinegar. Oh and opinions but I don't get those. Now if your want some homemade sides like potato or macaroni salad, this ain't your place. They get it at Sams club. However who cares really? The sammich is what matters and of you get the special you don't need a side. They also have chips or fries. Don't feel like a sammich? Well they have other items like pizza and salads. For the cheap price you can't beat this place. I love working on the west side.
