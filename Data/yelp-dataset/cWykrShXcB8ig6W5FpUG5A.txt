3	This place provided a good night's rest while I was traveling. The grounds are well kept and pretty. But if I was staying for more than one night, I would look at my other options...maybe the Residence Inn or a nearby Town Place about 15 miles away.If you compare this to Town Place Suites you've stayed in before, this one may be a bit disappointing. I like to stay in the Marriott family because they're usually so good to me. I enjoy the rewards program, the friendly service, comfortable and familiar rooms and most of all security and safety when I'm on the road. Charlotte provides most of what I look for but the rooms are a bit older. Older style furniture but still comfortable. Didn't use the kitchenette at all. The bathroom counter was SUPER short? Like to my crotch short and I'm only 5'2"....my tall friends would have to bend WAY over to brush their teeth. My relatives must've built this place.The front lobby area smelled- I think someone had just dropped a load in the nearby bathroom so not sure I can blame the hotel. We can probably thank the motor speedway fans with their hot dogs and beer diet. I am thankful the hotel didn't have one of those obnoxious air fresheners blowing out constant scents to try and mask the smell.
