4	Both my half frozen fingers (it was under 70 degrees!) & my empty tummy really appreciated the freshly brewed coffee selection & the quick check out (with a genuine smile!) at this local Circle K. I was feeling adventurous, so I went with a mixture of the hazelnut & cinnamon. I'm just crazy like that :)
3	Great snacks at the register
1	This place is whack. The worker was a total weenie and pretty creepy too. I'd go to one of the other places down the street.
5	I love this circle k. Not only because it is so convenient but its always stocked. The staff is friendly and they aren't the kind of staff that just ring up your items but they also ask about your day. The store is typically clean.  The outside area is clean, staff is typically on point about keeping thr out side area clean.  There is an ATM on site, news papers, propane area. Ice inside and outside,  pay phone with a by Sam stop out front.  There is a red box also.
