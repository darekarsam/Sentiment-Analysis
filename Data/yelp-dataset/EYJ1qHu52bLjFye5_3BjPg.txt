3	Typical Dollar Tree location.  Nothing to really write home about.  It's definitely cleaner than most DTs which is nice.  Located in the square where there really isn't much else, so it does fill a void for little things you need on your list, but don't want to spend some big money on.Ample parking outside.  Decent selection that could maybe benefit from a small expansion in items.
5	Love this location!  I went in here just to browse and found a ton of teacher supplies for my classroom.  One of the staff (Dee) noticed me sifting through their teacher section.  She told me about all the great items they had for teachers.  She told me about new items that would be in and even gave me a catalog when I told her I lived out of state.  This location was clean and organized.  They offered a great variety of items--all for a dollar (love those true dollar stores!).  The staff could not have been nicer!  Thanks for the help Dee!
