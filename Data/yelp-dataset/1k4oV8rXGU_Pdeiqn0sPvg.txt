5	I love this place!! They always work with my on my insurance, and Marlena is the best!!. I have had terrible acne for years even into my late 30s, and Marlena has helped me so much! Between chemical peels and micro, my face is so much better. I'm not embarrassed when I talk to people anymore. Thank you, Marlena for giving me back my confidence.
1	I had an appointment this morning at 0900.  I arrived and the office was closed.  I called the number and the person on the other end said she would find out and call me back.  She did, but all she could say was they had sick calls and closed the office and that she was sorry.  I had to rearrange my day for this and all I got was I'm sorry would you like to reschedule or would you like to go to Henderson location?
5	Good service, attentive personable doctor. Appointment was right on time. There is a good amount of paperwork for first time customers but no different than any other doctors office. Definitely recommend.
