4	Slice has opened up at a second location in Carnegie.  Get the same good pizza.  Check out the funny named specialty pizza or order it your way.  The pizza is a thinner crisp crust which I prefer.  The sauce is pretty good too.  The Slice philosophy is to make as much as possible from scratch and use good fresh ingredients. The shop is in a little store front with about 5 tables and a few seats in the window.   Also a little room with a big bank type vault door in the back.  It was pretty hot in the shop since it is not air conditioned.  So at this time of year you may want to take out. The take out menu states that it is BYOB.
4	Pretty good pizza, definitely a top 3 option when you're looking for a quick lunch in Carnegie.  I ordered a slice of white pizza and a meatball/banana pepper roll for lunch. It was ready a few minutes after ordering which is always a plus. The white pizza had spinach and tomatoes,  very thin crust (I'm usually not a fan but it worked well here) and the meatball /banana pepper roll was excellent. Very clean looking restaurant and the staff was very polite.
5	I would say this is the #1 pizza joint in carnegie. We've tried a number of pies and a few hoagies. I love the Frisky Billygoat pizza and their Steak hoagie is really tasty. The breadsticks with cheese are also a great addition!!!
2	We ordered the basil pesto chicken pizza. Flavor wise it was okay. The main turn off how how greasy the base was. My hands were coated with grease and afterwards my mouth felt all greasy.
