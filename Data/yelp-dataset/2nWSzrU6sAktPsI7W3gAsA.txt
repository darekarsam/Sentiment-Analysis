3	Nice downtown parade that the city of Charlotte puts on every year.  I suggest getting here 45-30 minutes early to make sure you get a good spot for a good look at all the floats, bands, etc.  And talking about the bands, they spotlight a lot of the local high schools and they are awesome.  I'm a sucker for a good drum line and this parade has some great ones.Of course, stick to the end and see the big man in charge, SANTA!
4	This is a fun Thanksgiving Day parade in Uptown Charlotte.  Obviously no floating Snoopys but there are plenty of bands, beauty queens, horses and fun!  It was a much longer parade than I thought - hope for a warm day or you are standing out in the cold for hours.  Many people get there early and line the parade route with camping chairs and blankets.  Very fun!
