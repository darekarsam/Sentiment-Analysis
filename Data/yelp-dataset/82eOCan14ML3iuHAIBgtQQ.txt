4	I've had takeout from this place twice, and I must say I am a fan.The pizza here is the closest thing I've tasted to anything coming from New Jersey (where I'm from originally), and I'm thankful to finally have found it. (In truth, this is the 2nd place in the Charlotte area from which I'd order pizza, but this place does it better -- much better.)I've also had a cheesesteak and the bruschetta. The former was very, very good -- a lot of steak, which is nice. The bruschetta, however, I found inedible, as it was just too hard.The restaurant, while I haven't dined in, looks nice at a glance. It's located in a strip mall. Parking seems ample. It can be difficult to make a left out of the lot depending on the time of day; the roadway fills up with a ton of traffic during rush hour.Let's just say I look forward to visiting again. I'd go tomorrow, but that would be the third day in a row!
3	$2.50 for a tea?  We like Portifinos and my lunch today was really delicious. Mushroom ravioli with sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms , red peppers and onion with an olive oil sauce. However when we asked for teas to go we were charged an extra $.50 each for the cup. Are you kidding me?  You're already charging $2.00 for the tea and you're tacking on for the cup?  That's nuts.   Live and learn. Will go back for the food but maybe not as often now.
2	I heard coworkers say it's such a great Italian restaurant but I'm not impressed , the flavor was lacking and the pasta was definitely not fresh . The service gave this Italian spot 2stars . My family wanted to ask for ketchup for their sauces :( . Well , maybe the pizza is good ?
