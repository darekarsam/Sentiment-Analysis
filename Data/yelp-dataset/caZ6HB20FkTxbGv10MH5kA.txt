5	I've been using them for a few months and they are so reliable.. show up exactly when they say they are, do a great job, leave a check list, etc.  Great service!
5	We love the gals at MaidPro. They always do a great job and we have 3 cats and a 150lb long hair dog. When they are done cleaning you would not know we have a zoo of pets. They are also really good with putting up with the pets. I love coming home to a clean house! I highly recommend MaidPro if your looking for extra help keeping your home clean.
5	I'm a single guy living here in Las Vegas and have been very impressed with the cleaning service of MaidPro.  They arrive on time, are very friendly, and leave my house spotless.  I would recommend them to any of my friends and family.
1	Not a good experience.  Nice enough workers, but they missed so many things. Would not use them again. Total disappointment!!
5	They do an amazing job. Very professional and courteous,  they were also very nice. We are definitely going to keep using them once a week and would recommend them to others.  They really go above and beyond and coming home to a clean house is pretty fantastic.
