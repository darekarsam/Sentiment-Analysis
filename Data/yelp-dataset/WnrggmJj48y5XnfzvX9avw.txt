4	I'm a big fan of tervis insulated tumbler glasses, and was shocked to round a corner in Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile shopping area and come across a tervis store!  Turns out they have several stores back East, but this is their first store in the West.If you like tervis tumblers for keeping hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold (the ones I have never sweat, even stocked with icy cold drinks) then this is the place to come.  Literally an amazing selection of tervis tumbler glasses, in all shapes, sizes and designs.  These tumblers can make a unique gift, and this store is perfect for that.  They are not cheap, about $11 a glass, but last forever (and come with a lifetime warranty).One thing I didn't like is that after a purchase the staff act like they are generously throwing in a top and a straw, but in fact these are added to the bill.  So a one star deduction from a distinctive, niche shop.
5	I went to the store in the miracle mile shops. I specifically went for a Las Vegas tumbler.  Do yourself a favor and bring one of these home.  Skip the made in China crappy knick knacks and t-shirts.  These cups will last for a lifetime, they are made in the USA, double insulated and keep your drinks cold or hot for hours upon hours.  I use one of my 40 cups every morning for my iced coffee.  LOVE THEM.
5	Best cups in the world.  You can have your drinks hot or cold and there is no heat transfer or condensation either.  The entire store top to bottom, left to right is all Tervis'd out, so it is a bit much to take on if you are not already on the wagon.  I told an employee that they are the best(!) and she really appreciated my enthusiasm.  Insert a picture of my Hubs rolling his eyes behind me as the employee and I stop short of high-fiving each other.  :Dp.s. Did I mention they make LA Kings cups?  I might have one...or 6 of them.  :)
