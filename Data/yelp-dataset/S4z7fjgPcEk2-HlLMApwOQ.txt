2	The exterior of this shop and the restaurant directly to the right are my favorite storefronts in all of Montreal Chinatown.  Right on the NE edge near the archway on a small brick road; this shop appears to be more authentic than the more commercial pastry shops up the block.  So, I decided to give it a try.It was the end of the night, right before closing, so the items were not very fresh.  But, even so, were not tasty at all.  There was a cookie that we purchased that tasted like A-1 Steaksauce.  A  Black Bean Pastry that was so hard that I could not even break it in half to share with my friend.  I also got the most flavorless Coconut Jelly that I have ever had, not served with a spoon, but you have to eat it straight out of a plastic bag.  All not good...
3	My friend loves to eat cha siu bao (BBQ pork bun) and claims this places makes the best place in montreal to get them. It is a homemade style bun, not too doughy, always fresh, ( tip they bake them in the daytime so they will taste better if you buy them fresh )
5	Authentic, the lady who works there is the sweetest and most hardworking lady. Do try everytjing they make. It is really delicious, authentic and better than bakeries ive visited in china. Thank you for being in CHina town!!!!! THe prices are crazy cheap, 1$ for a coconut tart??? Selling yourselves too short, you guys are wonderful!
