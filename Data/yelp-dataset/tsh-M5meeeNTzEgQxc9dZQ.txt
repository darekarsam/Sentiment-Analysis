5	Best new Vape shop in Tempe! The owner is passionate about vaping and has limitless knowledge about everything vape. LOTS of authentics, GREAT flavors and KILLER prices! AND it's a kickass place to just hang out, vape, and kick back a few hours. Definitely recommended whether you're a newbie or a veteran vaper!
5	Love this place. Guys is legit. Best prices on mods and juice, never pressure sells you and will give you any advice or help you need. Nice place to hang out and he will he'll build your coils for you too
5	It's a place you would miss if you don't look at the door for it's sign. However this place is chilled, you can try all the flavors they have right on the couch around a coffee table full of bottles. The prices here is fair for what they have.
1	Are they still open for business?  I've tried coming by a couple times but the lights are off and the doors are locked during business hours.  Not sure.
5	Long story short I'd been reading about Vaping online and did a lot of research. Even after everything I was confused and thought I'd give this place a try and actually talk to a professional.I'm so happy I did. We sat down, I told him about my smoking habits, my budget, and what I was looking to get out of vaping and before I knew it I was sampling different kinds of juices, trying different setups, and trying to find a perfect fit for me.The pricing was comparable to some of the online-retailers I had found and as an added bonus I felt good about purchasing from these guys because I knew if I ever had any problems they would be more than accommodating.If you're looking to get into vaping but have no idea what you're doing, come here with whatever money you have, sit down for 30 minutes, and before you know it you'll leave with a perfect kit for you needs.
