5	Love this store ,Riley was the most informative salesperson that i have ever talk to about phones and accessories!
5	I had an excellent experience working with Nathan at this store.  I needed to replace my phone that was due for an upgrade.  I received a lot of advice about different phones so that I could decide on the one would best suit my needs and wants.  They had the exact phone (and color) that I wanted in stock.  The staff is very knowledgeable (the representative provided me with all the information I was looking for and more) and very friendly.  I definitely recommend this location for your Verizon needs.
1	Arrived at this Mobile Generation store in Fitchburg at 11:05am on Wed Jan 22, 2014. Website said open at 10:00am, sign in door said open at 10:30am. Well, doors were locked and store was dark/closed when I arrived at 11:05am. Needless to say, a one-star rating for a store that is not even open during open hours!
