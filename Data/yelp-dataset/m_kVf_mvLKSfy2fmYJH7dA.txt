4	I had a bit of tire emergency and with winter here I didn't want to mess around with subpar tires. I bought my tires on TireRack and the guys here didn't have any problem installing them for me.  25 bucks per tire and I was out in 15 minutes.  It was awesome!
4	These guys are great. Passenger cars are not their main thing.. they seem to cater to industrial and big truck customers. Also, they are not auto generalists, they're tire guys, so don't come here to get your muffler replaced. Don't let that dissuade you though. They're awesome at tires. They took a) a last minute tire mounting request b) did the job with extra care (cleaned the rim of the wheel so the new tires seat properly, for instance) c) did it in about 30 minutes.
5	Great guys. Good prices on tires. No BS. This is the place to get tires if you live in Lawrenceville Bloomfield area.
