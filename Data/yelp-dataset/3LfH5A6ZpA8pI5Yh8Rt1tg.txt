4	Small, friendly wholesalers that are easy to find ...right off Valley View and Hacienda.  They have a one room warehouse with a fair selection of lillys, roses, peonies, hydrangeas...and a bunch of exotic plants.There is also a small hot room with exotics like birds of paradise.   Not an extensive orchid selection, but they looked vibrant and healthy.The thing about this warehouse is they have some pretty rare plants and new varieties.   The floral consultant Lisa explained they supply many of the local casinos and I believe it.   I've seen those "lobby arrangements" that have weird and amazing flowers!  She spent half an hour pointing out a dozen flowers and decorative plants that I had never seen...black flowers and fuzzy flowers.  Although they are wholesalers, I think they can sell to the public.   Impress your mom with something better than a $7 bouquet from Smiths...check this place out.  And take a coat!  It's cooooold in there!
5	I purchased the flowers here for a 50th wedding anniversary I was putting together for my parents. I called to ask about prices and spoke to Lisa, who was very helpful. My first purchase was just to sample the flowers before the big event, I got some hydrangeas and some roses and they were beautiful and opened up really well. They had trouble finding my account but Lisa took care of that as well. I came back 2 days before the big event and there were no problems whatsoever, my flowers were ready when I arrived to pick them up. I will for sure do business with this place again.
