5	Of all of the fresh fruit companies I have tried, this particular location is exceptional. You an taste the dif in the way the product is cleaned and taken care of. Chocolate covered bananas are AMAZING!
4	Edible Arrangements are a great gift for somebody who likes great food, and ideal for somebody who doesn't need more stuff. The fruit looks tempting and tastes delicious, with or without the yummy chocolate covering. I have ordered twice from this company, both times online. In each case, delivery was prompt and the gift was oh so welcome. Edible Arrangements are now the go-to gift for me to send a couple of people in my family.Prices are kind of high, but I actually end up spending less for an Edible Arrangement than I would for flowers or other gifts. And I know that the Edible Arrangement will be enjoyed--I can't always say the same about clothing, household gifts, or even flowers. A word about ordering something perishable that you will never see: This business has delivered exactly what I ordered, even though I was ordering from out of state.
1	The staff at this location in East Liberty can really use customer training. They should all be sent to a customer service boot camp.  When I called to inquire about a purchase I had recently made I had gotten a rude person on the phone who made it loud and clear that I was being a inconvenience.  With so many Edible Arrangement vendors in town I would think this location would treat it's customer better since there is so much competition.  This place is the pitts.
1	A gift from my children was delivered to the next door neighbor, with no note on the door to even notify us that the delivery of the fruit basket is delivered next door.  The neighbor stored the fruit basket outside and gave it to us 24 hours later.  Fruit is not even edible now.  Very poor execution of delivery. Never use this service any more.
