5	I think it's fairly safe to say that the vultures are circling round the O'Brien's chain as a whole, with many of their stores disappearing, and this large one on High Street, surely as close to a flagship outlet as they'll get, worryingly empty even at 1pm on a weekday.High prices, limited choice, lack of offers or advertising presence, the list of failings stretches as long as my arm, but as Eleanor says they're chicken and bacon number is pretty mouthwatering. Try it before the bailiffs arrive.
