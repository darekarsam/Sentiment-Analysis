5	Galeria de los Muertos just opened on November 5th in the Roosevelt Arts District of Downtown Phoenix.  They are open 6 days a week (every day but Monday) so that you can see and buy art whenever it is convenient for you.  They have new exhibits opening every month and throw events for First Fridays, Second Saturdays, 3rd Fridays and other special events.One of the cool things about this gallery is that they make giclee prints of the original works that are affordable so everyone can own the art of the local artists they show.  Their little prints are only $10 and the 8x12 and 8x12 prints on canvas stretched over wood frame are a steal at only $30.  They are definitely throwing down a cool business model by showcasing amazing art and making it available and affordable to the general public.
