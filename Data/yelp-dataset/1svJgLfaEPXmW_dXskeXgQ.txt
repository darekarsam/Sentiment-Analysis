4	Here is another gem in the Petit Portugal area.  I have to agree with the previous reviewers on two points.  This city has many Portuguese bakeries and not all are good, but this one is fantastic.  It has a huge selection of baked goodies to choose from.  There are pasteis de nata (custard cakes), almond croissants, lemon squares, chocolate eclairs, Portuguese bread, and the list goes on.Pros:-The goods are fresh.  I find eating at the local bakeries a saving grace in terms of quality, price and convenience.  There is allot of local flavor here in both the culture and food. -The prices are extremely reasonable. -The establishment is clean.  Its tiny, but its comfortable. -Seating is available inside.-Good location.  Its in a vibrant and safe neighborhood. -The staff is friendly and quick. -They speak French, Portuguese and English as needed.
