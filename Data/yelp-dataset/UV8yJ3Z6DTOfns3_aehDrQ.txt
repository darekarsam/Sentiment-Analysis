5	I had to turn in a leased Mazda, and the guy Mazda sent to inspect the damages just reamed me for the costs; they were blatantly over-inflated.I took my car to Dent Busters -- damage that was estimated to be 1200 dollars they did for 500.  They were really friendly, honest, and timely.Great guys, and a great place.  I will definitely, without a doubt, go back to them for any repairs.
5	The gent that owns the place is nothing short of an artist!  He has an eye for body work and has removed numerous door dings from a number of my vehicles, all without paint, bondo or serious downtime waiting on repairs.  Typical dings range 60-80 bucks.  Here is a tip, they have a coupon on their web site for a discount of $20.  I suggest an appointment for best luck, but I have also been good on a walk-in basis numerous times.  Worth it.  Beats a regular body shop.
5	I needed paintless dent removal and the traditional dent removal method due to the differing traits of the dents a vandalism on my car left.  I got to work with Gilbert (traditional dent removal and paint specialist) and with Rod (PDR specialist).  Both were extremely professional and explained everything to me as the process moved along, never assuming additional work until after speaking with me to get the ok to move forward with it.  My car looks perfect.  I even noticed that Gilbert touched up a scratch on my clear coat that I had accidentally made.  I shopped around and found that their prices are very fair. They have a safe lock-down if your car needs to stay overnight and a nicely set waiting area for customers.  While I hope I never have to see those cool guys again, I will keep their info on record if the unfortunate ever happens again to one of my cars.
