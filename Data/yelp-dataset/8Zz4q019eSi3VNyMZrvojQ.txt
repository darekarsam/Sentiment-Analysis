5	We visited this showroom looking for a Refrigerator, Washer/Dryer and Microwave; we met Roger, the manager, who helped us figure out what we wanted and gave us a quote based on package pricing.  We then went everywhere appliances are sold in this city just to see how they compared.  We ended up right back here and purchased everything from Roger, he even beat the Sears Department Store...  Then came the delivery, and what could have been a serious dilemma for us. The new refrigerator was massive in our small condo kitchen.  Stressing a little, I went back to Roger and told him our situation.  He didn't even bat an eye, we went online found the same model Refrigerator in a counter depth and a few days later they picked up the original fridge and brought in our new one.  No issues!The deliveries went just as smooth, the teams from both deliveries were professional, made sure everything was in working order, picked up every scrap of delivery material and were just all around pleasant to work with.  I love our new appliances and this showroom made all the differance!
1	We've bought from this place a few times, and will NEVER do so again. There has been an issue every single time. Terrible follow up and nothing but issues with delivery, pick up, etc. So incredibly frustrating. I would give zero stars if possible.
1	Do not shop at this store.  They quoted me a price in writing; would not honor it when they went to go ring it up and told me to go shopping elsewhere.  Terrible and rude, rude attitude!!!!
4	I was referred to this location because a casual friend knows Jacob.  He was very helpful, explained how warranties & service agreement work.  He even thought of things I didn't even think about while seeking a new refrigerator.  I feel like I'm getting the best fridge for the money.  I even referred my mother-in-law to him.  Neither of us live on this side of town but trust is worth the drive.
