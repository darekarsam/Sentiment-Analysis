5	This guy is great! Best Prices in town and friendly service everytime!
5	Gary returned my call immediately and within an hour was in my house to fix plumbing issues. I had called another plumber previously and just over the phone gave me an estimate of $900 to $2000! Gary fixed the problem for 80 bucks. I highly recommend this company!
5	If you are looking for a honest plumber...it is the solo owner of this company, Gary. He was cool and honest, works alone...he changed my water heater at I think a good price from most. Will be a returning customer for plumbing needs.
