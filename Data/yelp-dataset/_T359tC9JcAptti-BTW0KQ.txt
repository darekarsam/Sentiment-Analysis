5	Stephanie is my go-to gal. I can always trust her to be honest about what would work best and look best for my hair type, face shape, bone structure and coloring. She is up to date on the current trends and seasonal changes, and can make a recommendation on what I should do next. I can say how many people have complimented my highlights and low lights, and I have had several people come up to me and say they are a hair stylist, and ask me to find out which dye numbers my stylist uses so they can use the same on someone they know with my brown hair color. I will never go anywhere else!
5	Stephanie has been doing my hair for 8+ years! She's become my friend, not just my hair lady. She is passionate and knows what she is doing.
