3	Wifey and I enjoy checking out places like this.  Sometimes you find treasures, other times, nada.  We walked away from this place with the latter.  There's not much of a selection, but what do you expect from a store in a small town like Cave Creek?  Nevertheless, it was fun to browse for a little while.Return Factor - 50%
5	I just want to say what an awesome experience I always have coming to the Gold Mine.  The treasures you can find at this place are incredible, particularly when it comes to furniture, linens, kitchen and home decorating/accessories. What makes this store extra special are the wealthy clientele that donate and the unique, truly outrageous finds you can have here.  Nothing short of high-end at very nice prices.  Keep in mind that the staff knows their product really well, so if you are looking for bargain basement prices, shop elsewhere.  It is important to remember that many of the items donated here you would never find at bargain basement junk stores in the first place!  This is a very special find and I come routinely when I am in Arizona for the winter.  The ladies that work there are friendly and the church it is associated with beautiful too.   Get there when they open and take your time to really look without being rushed.  If you see something you think is special when the doors open, do NOT balk at the price and wait around to think about it.  It will be gone within 30 minutes or less because other people that shop there know their product too and come specifically to find unique, expensive items they couldn't afford elsewhere.  Also, remember that credit cards are NOT accepted, so hit the ATM before you come.
