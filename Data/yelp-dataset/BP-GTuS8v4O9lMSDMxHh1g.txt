5	When I called Townsend pest I told Lyle what I had and though fought with German roaches for 8 months Lyle said no problem. And I haven't seen one since. They did what seemed impossible to me. Thanks Lyle
5	I live on a large lot out here in Las Vegas, I called Townsend Pest Control because of an ongoing issue I've been having with rats. I had 2 other companies out to get rid of the problem, they'd set up a box trap with bait and yet the rat problem seemed to be getting increasingly worse. I was at my wits end when I called Townsend and spoke with Lyle. He's the owner and he seriously knows his stuff. My nick name for him is "rat man" I'm telling you he's the master! He has these awesome bait rocks that he sets out, they look great in the yard! He was on it, changed the bait consistently, communicated with me and just gave it his best effort. The rat population is virtually non existent. We will be using this company for all our pest needs, they spray for bugs too. Can't say enough about this company, #1 in effectiveness and integrity!
