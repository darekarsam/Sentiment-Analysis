5	Quality, professional tattoo artist. Robby does beautiful work!  He can do any style and pull it off with finesse. Go check out the shop!
5	Robbie is super talented, great artist and has been great to me and my hubby. I had a artist really screw up on one big tattoo on my arm and Robbie helped make it look so much better and finished the rest of my sleeve. I know very proud to show it off.
5	So glad to see Last Shot Tattoo is back!!!!  Had my cover up done at the old Last Shot, and am happy to say that there is absolutely no trace of my ex wife's name on my arm anymore!!  Robby Slaughter is a great artist, and goes out of his way to make his shop a cool place to hang out and have work done.  Everything is sterile, and extremely clean, and prices are beyond fair for the great work they do........I highly recommend this shop, and can't wait to check out the new location!!!
