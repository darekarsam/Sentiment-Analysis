5	Up to this point I have limited reviews to great restaurants and great food.  I don't see the point in finding fault with places that I've tried...I just don't return to the place and try other things. Peg and I have known Dr. Sielicki since her practice opened...and I will never go elsewhere. She and her staff are so competent, the technology is up to date, and the feeling going into and out of her office is one of satisfaction. If you have thought that going to a dentist is only one step up from self-mutilation, then you are in for a VERY different experience. The friendliness, skill level, and wonderful front office staff make things very easy to begin....and never go elsewhere.  Dr. B
1	I changed from this dentist to another one.  The office is nice but I personally did not think i was getting quality care.  After going to new dentist they alerted me to all kinds of issues that I was not even aware of and needed to be done.  I feel office was more about profits than patient care.
5	I can't really explain "dentist anxiety" to someone who doesn't relate. I prioritize a healthy, white smile as much as anyone, but going to the dentist is not something I ever look forward to. This office alleviated my dentist anxiety within the first couple minutes of stepping in. The staff are all friendly, the waiting room is unlike any 'waiting room' you've been in before (in a good way) and Dr. Sielicki herself is amazing.I have since referred my mom to see Dr. Sielicki, who has also had a good experience. My mom's had icky dental drama and Dr. Sielicki spent a time giving her options, going over procedures, recommendations, etc.
