5	Best Burger king ever! The only thing missing would be for them to serve beer. Super clean, new looking and just the best burger kind I've been too. The menus are electronic screens which makes it look modern and classic. I'm dying to try this picture I saw of a ice cream sundae with bacon! They even have things like sweet potatoes fries which is different. They have a cool vending machine for soda the one where you can mix the sodas. Free wifi, but no outlets. Nice and cool inside, and lots of parking, its right next to barnes and noble and bank of america next to the metro mall. *also they have this amazing deal going on BK happy hour $1 small fraps and smoothies yum!! 3-5pm everyday, I go here for a mid afternoon coffee break!
4	Great service today.
1	This used to be a good Burger King. Long lines of people at the counter returning food. Wrong food given to the wrong customers. Management needs to address the poor customer service. Several times found people practically bathing in the bathrooms.
3	Average location. Clean, drive thru is a little slow, but employees are friendly and helpful.
