4	Good, solid pool hall.  Nice staff and generally good tables, recommended!
1	It's been two years since I stepped foot in this place, which as coincidence would have it, was both the first and the last time. IIRC, it's 18 and up but you can get a hand stamp or wrist band if you want to drink the Devil's sweet, sweet nectar.   Lots of punk kids in here playing pool, I felt like a damn grandpa.  Might be cool if you really like pool, or want to prey upon fresh nubile 18yo pool hall skanks.
4	Visiting the family in Gilbert, da momma, baby brother and I came here to shoot a little pool.  By "da momma", I'm actually talking about my mother.  And by "baby brother", I'm actually referring to my younger brother.I love pool by the hour, and at $8 per hour, the rate was good.  They serve typical pizza/wings/cheesesticks-type food, as well as drinks.  I had Heineken and it was cold and tasty.  Waitresses were attentive and friendly.My moms surprised me; she's quite the shark.  And baby bro didn't do so bad himself.  We spent a good two hours in there, between 7:30 and 9:30 on a Saturday night, and had a good time.It's 18 and up, so there are some young'uns in there, as well as people who are old enough to drink.  There were also a lot of couples there; it seems like quite the date-place.All in all, if you're with family-style mixed company like I was, it's a fun spot to visit.
1	Lazy Q CLOSED in 2010.  New Owners cleaned up the place and its called JESTERS BILLIARDS.  Tons of beer, AC smoking patio with pool tables.  Re-did tables and got new cues.  Its rockin now.
