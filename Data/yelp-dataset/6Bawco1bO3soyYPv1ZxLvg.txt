5	This is the real deal! Cafe Rico takes quality of of its beans very seriously by delivering coffee lovers with a vast array of complex flavored beans (over 18 types) in an extremely friendly atmosphere! On a Saturday morning, surrounded by burlesque photographies and smooth jazz music, I had the pleasure of enjoying an espresso and latte which were very reasonably priced!Owner Sevan, half Armenian and half Columbian, brings new meaning to fair trade  by working directly with coffee producers from Bolivia, Brasil, Guatemala, Mexico, Indonesia, New Guinea, Tanzania... and roasts its own coffee right here in Montreal. One his creations actually was recently evaluated a Barista Coffee championship in Frederic.If you're a true aficionado or a an enthusiast, do stop by for a cup of the "real deal"!
4	Cafe Rico is a great fair-trade cafe with its own roasting operation, and makes a great cup of coffee. The space is long and narrow, but never feels too cramped. Still, the atmosphere isn't always the most conducive for working or a long chat with an old friend; the bean grinders can amp up the noise level quite a lot, and there can be surprising drafts from the front and back doors. That said, the decor is lovely, and I'd take a hand-pulled latte here over the generic competition up the block any day.Also, urban parents take note: In the back, there is a cute little toy kitchen and other toys (bead maze, etc.), where kids can play and let mom and dad caffeinate. Much appreciated.
