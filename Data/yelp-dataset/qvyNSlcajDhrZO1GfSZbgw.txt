1	Quite possibly the worst omelet I've ever had. It was so over cooked that they couldn't even fold it over with out slitting it in the middle.  My potatoes were also cold.  Honestly, terrible food.
3	Burger was decent, service was good.  Poor selection of drinks and honestly way over priced for this little spot.
