2	Most pretzels from Auntie Ann's are very greasy and over salted. The aroma coming from the store location is overpowering and unappealing.However, there is one pretzel that I do thoroughly enjoy from Auntie Ann's. That pretzel would be the sour cream and onion pretzel with the hot salsa cheese. The two make for a great combo! I would highly recommend giving it a try.If you're ordering a specialty pretzel, ask for a pretzel that is unsalted. This will ensure that they make you a fresh pretzel! You can then salt the pretzel yourself if you desire.The pretzel bites are good for a group, however, not the best value.
