1	Beware the return policy - or lack thereof. It's a large store with a nice selection, but when I tried to return a toy from their store that did not work properly (in original packaging with THEIR sticker on it), I was told that they wouldn't take it back without a receipt, even though it was a gift. Now I'm stuck with a $40 toy that my 2 yr old cant use. There are too many other good stores for this kind of rigidity, and I will gladly give my money to Learning Express or Toys & Co. in the future.
2	I am giving this store 2 stars based on Customer Service alone. The front desk is located right in front of the entrance. The day I walked in, two employees were at the desk chit chatting about someone and completely ignored me. What I was looking for ended up being on the front desk. This I did not know until I overheard one of the employees make mention of the item. As I walked up they both stopped talking and looked at me. I had to tell them what I needed was in front of them. One turned around and walked into the store, the other waited for me to make my selection.  I did at least get a Thank You out of the employee who rang me up.
4	The folks here are super helpful finding birthday gifts for kids regardless of age and interest. Add free gift wrapping and a rewards program it makes for a decent value.
