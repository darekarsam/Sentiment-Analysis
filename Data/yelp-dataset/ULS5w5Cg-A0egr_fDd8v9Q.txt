5	Great place for take-out. The owner was super nice. Had the pulled pork potato and the New York Cheese Cake sweet potato. Both were amazing.
4	Stopped in the Phoenix area and looked up places to eat. Found this spot and I'm always a sucker for loaded baked potatoes. Stopped by and was greeted by the very friendly Miss "D". Lots of ways to load up your spud and from the smells that were coming from the kitchen I was looking forward to my order. Ordered a Jumbo with pulled pork. Miss "D" helped make some suggestions, and I wasn't disappointed. A lot of times I get a baked potato and I always feel the toppings are skimped on. Not here, great topping to spud ratio. The interior is pretty bare, more for a takeout spot and you could easily drive by it, but stop in and try it out.
5	These potatoes are truly made from love!!! I ordered the jerk chicken fully loaded potato...BOMB.com!! No skimpy toppings, full of chicken and flavor! Oh and the kool-aid is on point too
