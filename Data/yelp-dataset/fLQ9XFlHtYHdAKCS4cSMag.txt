2	Its a standard Subway. Unfortunately some employees speak barely english, which makes ordering or asking questions extremly hard. Now, English is my second language too, but at least I able to communicate pretty good.... One lady tends to be rather rude, and ignores people and/or their questions. She sighs a lot when you ask her if she would please (Yes we always say please and thank you!) put more dressing on the sandwich or whatever.Literally, she sigh's! Maybe i would be too if I had to work at Subway and all those americans come in and order in english but I dont speak nor do I understand english. How rude of us to order in english!
3	An average Subway restaurant, the people were nice and quick.  Smells like wonderful fresh baked bread and the facility was clean.
2	The employees here never smile. Maybe they are all having a bad day but jeez where is the friendly customer service?
1	Well we all know subway is bomb, but what makes the place is the customer service and this subway has the worst customer service of all subways. Because it is a 24 hour restaurant we had to ring the bell and wait to be buzzed in,we stood outside for about 15 min waiting for the employee to open the door after we were just inside of the store 2 minutes prior. Finally he let us in and seemed like he hated his job and we were an inconvenience, he took his time and didn't even really acknowledge we were there. I hate writing bad reviews but this really was not necessary. Not even one star rating.
2	Worst service ever!Everytime I go in the employees never smile, are rude, talk to you with attitude, and it's a drag just sitting there to eat your sandwich.It's really close to my house but I will for SURE not be going back to this one.2stars because subway is still good.
2	A basic Subway location, although I try to avoid it when I can. The employees are nice but they often have trouble with some of their clientele which can often make it unpleasant inside.The location is hit or miss.
