5	Great service. My husband found the shoes he was looking for. The sales associate was funny and interactive. We will be back.
5	This place has exceptional staff that helped me with my every need. The manager was awesome at helping me find exactly what I was looking for and even offered to fix my destroyed sperrys for me. This will be one of the only places I come to get shoes from now on. Excellent place
5	After leaving empty handed from many shoe stores I was sooooo happy to find a place where the staff really wanted to help you and have fun in the process.  Can't say enough good about Cody and his team.  My grand daughter loved her shoes and would not take them off.  She said she looked like a fashion girl:)
