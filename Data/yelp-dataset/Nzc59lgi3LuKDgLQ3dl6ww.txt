4	I really like this location it is a bit small. There are no crowds that I have ever ran into. It is convenient for me off the 303 freeway and Glendale. I can just drive and drop off mail.  If I have to go inside there are friendly faces there to help me. I wish I added this location a long time ago.  I would have had more check ins.
1	Although this is an okay location, it is extremely inconvenient with the hours cut in the middle of the day for lunch and no large parcel drop box. When you show up 10 minutes before they open and ask if you can drop off a package, they will scold you and treat you like a piece of crap so don't come here expecting anything better than minimal customer service. Some of the postal workers that are here are just wonderful while others (a lady with blonde hair and glasses) is a wretched sea hag. Because of the extremely poor attitude of this woman and not appreciating getting yelled at, I personally do not use this location anymore.
