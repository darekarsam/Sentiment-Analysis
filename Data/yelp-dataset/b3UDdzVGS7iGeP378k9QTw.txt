5	Chorizo pizza is the bomb. Hands down in the top 5 pizzas in phoenix az
3	Pizza is really good better then little ceasers . Wait area is clean friendly service.
5	Cant beat $4.00 pizza. It is really good for the prize. My husband likes it more than little Caesars and my brother likes it way more than hungry howies. Best of all, no waiting in line, you just walk in and pick it up.
