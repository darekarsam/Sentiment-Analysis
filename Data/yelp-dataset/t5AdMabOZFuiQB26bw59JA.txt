5	We used Steven for the identification and diagnosis of trees on our property. We found him on the WI Arborist Assoc. website. He was very generous with his information and didn't try to sell me something I didn't need. He has green options if that's what you like. I just found out he also does landscape/lawn design, install and maintenance. His ad says, "The Care of Trees, Shrubs & Lawns". He has 6 certified arborists on staff. I saw a coupon in the Homeowner's Advantage booklet that comes in the mail. I have already recommended him to someone else. Update: Our trees are looking much better since we had Steve apply compost tea. (2 yrs in a row).Update 11-2011. Had soil tested at UW and they analyzed it for us and gave us a 3-year recommendation on how to treat our lawn. We can do it or they can do it. No big sell here again.Update 11-2014-Still using this company. Our yard looks greeeaatt!
5	Steven Bassett Landscaping just took out a nasty Hawthorne tree eyesore from our property.  It was in the middle of a lot of plants and they did not disturb a single one!  The hosta weren't trampled, everything is just like it was before they started.  They removed every twig - with thorns -  which must have been hard.   Great job!
4	They do a great job on trees. I've always been happy with the trimming they've done for us on our mature locust trees, and they even identified two other trees that were diseased. Those trees have since been removed. Steven R Bassett did one and a friend took the other for firewood.
