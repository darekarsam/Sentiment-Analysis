5	I am a huge fan of Korean and Japanese foods, and nothing is more interesting to me then giving my homemade items a little Japanese kick (wasabi & sesame ice-cream?).At this Korean and Japanese grocer you will find everything from the more common items, like wasabi, miso paste and a selection of seaweed, to the harder to find and lesser known products like Kewpie mayonnaise, dried bonito flakes and fish sauce.I often know exactly what I am looking for when I shop here as many of the labels are in Japanese and the translations don't always match up exactly. However, I am usually happy to take a "risk" and try something I am unsure of.This market carries quite a large selection of seasonings and noodles. They also have some fresh vegetables including many varieties of mushrooms, shiso, and lemon grass.They also have a large selection of miso, kimchi (my addiction), and dried seaweed. Finally, they have a frozen section with sushi grade cuts of fish and seafood, dumplings and frozen desserts, including Moshi - another one of my addictions.The service here is a little hectic but always friendly.
4	I like this place for getting my non-run-of-the-mill Asian stuff that is from Japan! We're talking less expensive Kewpie Mayonnaise that other places, great selection of Miso paste, tobiko, and it's been my go to place for larger bottles of Mirin.  They have a large selection of soy sauce and ranging from low sodium and of course wheat free tamari and a kikkoman brand of gluten free soy sauce. I might be strange for doing so, but while some girls enjoy window shopping at malls and boutiques, I kinda love browsing aisles at grocery and specialty food stores. This trip I picked up some togarashi spice (perfect for kicking up your noodles a bit) and Meiji Milk Chocolate along with a bag of sushi rice, a bottle of cold green tea, and mirin and mild sodium miso paste. Now, let's get cookin'!
