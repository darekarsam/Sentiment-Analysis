2	They have friendly staff but idk if it was because we were the last car but they didn't do a very good job. We purchased a full service wash which includes cleaning of inside and out .....The car was not vacuumed correctly and they didn't even wipe the inside or at least it looked like they didn't when I ran my hand across the dash board my hand was dusty my windows were not clean and on top of that we already had tipped them I will not be going back ever .....  what I paid for the work they did it was not worth it I could have done this my self the only reason they did get 2 stars was for the friendly staff .
1	If I wanted water spots on my car after I pay to have it cleaned, I'd go through the automatic washes. If I wanted the person who is charging me for hand-waxing my car to leave those spots there, and say there's nothing he can do about them, I'd ask my kids to do it. Total rip-off.
1	Had a complete detail very clean place but unless  you want your floor mats stolen go somewhere else. I had a clear plastic runner floor mat in the back of my truck to protect my mats and the floor when I got my truck back he said mats where in the bed of the truck I quickly glanced saw some but didn't realize till the next day when he told me I could put them in I didn't have my rear floor mats. just the clear runner one when I called he said he talked to Armando who was the only one working on my car he said he put them in the back clearly he didn't.  then Carlos the manager I guess acted as if it was no biggie if Armando said he put them then he must have was his attitude will Never go back. !!!
