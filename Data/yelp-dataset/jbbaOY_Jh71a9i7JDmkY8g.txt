Prices are really good as in comparison to Giant Eagle, which is a total rip off.  The fuel perks through SnS are so much better than GE... with a $50 purchase, it seems I get .05 off a gallon!  You have to spend tons more at GE just to get .10 off per gallon, and everything is overpriced anyway.... I might as well shop at Whole Foods...This SnS also seems to have some items I can't find anywhere else, and also is lacking some things I buy regularly, so I guess it's a trade off.  I save lots of money at this grocery store, and if I have to, I'll get my lacking items at the Dirty Bird down the hill (as we South Siders like to call it).  The employees are friendly, like a neighborhood store should be.  Customer service is NOT extinct here, like almost everywhere else.  "Can I help you?" is not a foreign language at this store, and there are no stares from those working the registers to almost say, "I can't believe you picked my line, I need to go on break!"  There's no gym like hopping across the parking lot trying to dodge tumble-weaves, and popped-off fake French manicures from jitney rides gone awry... no body's dirty kids touching everything then opening the last package of Chips Ahoy, sampling them, and then tossing them onto the incorrect shelf, because they're bored and hungry.This is just an older neighborhood store that has the feel of an old grocery store of times gone by.  I can appreciate that.
