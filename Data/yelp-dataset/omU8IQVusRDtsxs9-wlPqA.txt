5	This store was super amazing, they have every brand of glass you could think of! Also I ending up getting one of the ego cigs and I love it! Great knowledgable and friendly staff. Would defiantly recommend over infinitys end.
5	Great place cheap prices friendly staff. Came out of state and where not very familiar with some products they explained and gave recommendations. Needless to say we went back multiple times while we where there.
5	My favorite spot to buy items for my hookah. Prices are reasonable and staff is always friendly and knowledgable.
