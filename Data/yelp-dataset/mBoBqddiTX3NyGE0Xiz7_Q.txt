4	I went there for takeout. I ordered pho, and it was ready in less than 5mins. Not only that but they gave me an extra spring roll as a lunch special. I've had plenty of takeouts, and it was really cheap for everything they gave me (9$). Not only did they have basil leaves, but they gave me fresh parsley.While waiting, the cashier and I had some idle chat to pass time. We don't see that in every viet places, since most of them are cold or absent until your order is ready.Most importantly, the soup wasn't filled with MSG. I know that because I'm sensitive to MSG, and when I have too much I start to get really sick.EDIT: I went there again and took the biggest bowl. I got a little bit dizzy from the MSG but that's because of sheer quantity. In any case that huge bowl was still like 10$ tx included XD.
