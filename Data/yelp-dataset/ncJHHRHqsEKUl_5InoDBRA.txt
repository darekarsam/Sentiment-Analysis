4	Good work.  He does very nice, high quality work.  A bit on the expensive side (costs $30 to shorten two pairs of pants) which I guess is reasonable considering that he does reliably high quality work.  I haven't given him anything more complex than that however so I don't know how he'll take in your wedding dress, but works for me.
4	This place is great, and even calls to double check when they find something they aren't sure about. I have had business suits altered here, jackets, etc. My husband had a beloved winter coat that he wanted to have the pockets repaired, and Vincent (or another man) called back 45 minutes later, freaking out (very politely) about "HOW CAN I REPAIR THESE POCKETS?! THEY ARE AWFUL! NO POCKET LEFT! SHREDS!" and we had a good laugh after telling him we meant for him to replace the pockets altogether. He did a fabulous job and even though he's not cheap it is worth it to know you will get the clothes back in great shape.
4	Vincent has done several hems and jacket alterations on men suits for me. Items have always been one time and done well. I would recommend this place to anyone searching for a tailor in Pittsburgh. It does seem a little expensive, but worth it, because its done correctly.
4	It was 1:00 pm on Friday and i was in a serious bind... I needed new suit pants altered and my flight was leaving the next day at 10:00 am. I called and Vincent said he would help. He got the job done, with a smile and his work was perfection. I would recommend Vincent to anyone needing alterations. Great customer service.
