4	Love the carts. Pretty much love all the carts. But whenever I eat from any of the carts this must accompany my meal. She has a really large variety of fruits to make smoothies and you can mix and match. There are also non-fruit things that you can add like chocolate but I always stick to the fruit. MmmmmmmMMm.
4	Nice smoothies but this review is more a plug for their spring rolls-- not sure if these are a regular item (there was a sign taped to the straw dispenser advertising them), but a single spring roll here was nearly as big as a burrito-- so a spring roll and a smoothie will pretty much set you up for lunch!
