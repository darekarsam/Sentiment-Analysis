4	Another inexpensive place for a really tasty quick lunch in Jean Talon Market, le Ryad stands in the very middle of the covered crossroads in Jean Talon market. Essentially a square with three long glass display counters full of Moroccan pastries and sweets (oh the honey! oh the rosewater!) there is a also a small section of savoury stuffed stuff (burekas, calzones, empanadas) - fillings options include chorizo, spinach, fresh mozzarella, kefta, and more. Thrown into a toaster oven these are delicious, the dough is thin and light and good greasy (not bad greasy) and not at all dry and the flavors haven't disappointed yet, especially at $3.The staff here are charming. They hover around all the counters all day long taking orders from every corner in a relaxed manner that is like a little pocket of calm in the bustle. Recommended!
3	My rating is based on the turkish delight alone. Which was OK. Better than most store bought, but still not a taste of turkey. Very nice variety of flavours. I'd recommend Ryad only if you have a craving, and not as a place for the best.
3	Ryad is a place that has one of the most prime real estate location for a kiosk in the food/restaurant area of MJT.  Right in the center at the east entrance by the stairs heading down to the parking.  You can't miss it!    My review is based on some of the rose flavoured lakoum (turkish delight) which I thought to be just okay.  My work friend brought me some back from Turkey and the real Mccoy was so much fresher and more amazing in flavour.  Here at Ryad it's passable but not amazing!  They do however have a wonderful selection of other Morrocan and middle Eastern pastries and also different stuffed pastry options.  I did not try these but I will come back and check them out.
