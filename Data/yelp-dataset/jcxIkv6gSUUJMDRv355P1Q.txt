5	I love playing poker at the Mirage! Players are usually friendly and fun. Late night conversations can get interesting. The best thing about this poker room is how great the dealers are. Jay is awesome! He kept the game moving and entertained the table. Matthew was my next dealer and he gets high marks from me as well! Can't wait to go back tonight.
5	Really enjoyed playing here.  Good mix of regulars, drunk tourists, and people who have no idea how to play the game.  Overall, very profitable.  Good dealers, good atmosphere, good drink service.  The wife hit a high hand bonus two nights in a row, so that was pretty cool too.  I'll definitely play here again.
5	The mirage is one of my favorite poker rooms in town.    The dealers are some of the best in town. Plus the players are really awful so it's like free money lol. The room itself is really nice and comfortable. Plus the mirage has the easiest parking on the strip. I would give this room a strong 9.1 out of 10.
