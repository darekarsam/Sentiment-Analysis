5	Very nice and quiet temple.  Priests are very good and accommodating. If you have pooja at home this is the best place to bring the priest from. You don't have to pick and drop them, they will drive and come. Only disadvantage is that it's too far from Phoenix.
5	A great temple built along traditional lines.  Has a quiet and meditative feel upon arrival.  Very engaged group of people attend and everyone is welcome.  The only downside is that it is far from the Valley -- but definitely worth the trip.
