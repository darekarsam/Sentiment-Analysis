4	Amir is great! The food is always good, and they always stuff your take-a-way box really well. Staff are really nice, and restaurant is really clean! Amir is a great food if you want a full stomach on the go.
1	Bad customer service and rude employees. Unfriendly atmosphere. The young girl serving me looked disgusted to work there and was purely throwing the food on the plate! Not going back
