4	This is the cheapest gas station I've been able to find near the Vegas strip. The convenience store is well stocked with essentials. I'd recommend this place.
1	Beware, this place is ripping you off, in my opinion.  Because my gas gauge is broken, I fill up based on miles driven since last fill up and know how many gallons are needed to fill the tank with great accuracy.  The one time I bought gas here, the pump said it dispensed about three gallons more than my tank should have been able to hold.
4	Cheapest gas station near the Las Vegas airport.
4	I thought the slot machines were pretty welcoming. It gives the feeling you're in Las Vegas even when you are on the way out of state.
5	We pumped gas.. Nothing amazing about that. Its hard to get into the gas station right now with all teh construction going on off Warm Springs but they have Diesel has which is what we pump. There is a smog little hut here if you need smog. Just saying in the event you need to kill 2 birds with one stone while you are here.
4	Filled up the gas at Rebel on the way to returning the car before flight back to OAK.This might be the cheapest gas around the rental car place, under 10 miles at least.Cash sign said $2.52, but you don't see the Credit price until you pump.  It was $2.57 which is only 5c more per gallon.
