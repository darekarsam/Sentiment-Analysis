3	Good all around selection of Asian groceries With a Vietnamese emphasis.
4	A cozy and dainty grocery shop that provides a unique selection of Asian seasonings and spices and run by a lovely family.The store is a tad difficult to navigate as the aisles are pretty close to each other, as another Yelper has mentioned. However, the variety of condiments, snack foods, and other goods make up for that aspect. There's even a small refrigerated section that offers their homemade Vietnamese desserts that you can't really find elsewhere.
4	Since Pamela's was crazy packed on a sunny Saturday, my girlfriend and I decided just to snack of good ol' street food. The stall in front of the grocery has a handful of items - rice, noodles, chicken skewers and mung bean pancakes. Always game to try something new, I went for the pancake and at $2.50 it was hard to go wrong.It was fluffy and had onion inside, and nice crispy edges for contrast. It packed a good bit of heat as well, but it wasn't overpowering. If you're in the Strip and looking for a tasty bite on the go, hit up Kim Do!
