1	Eh.  They took me in when no one else would have me but that is the end of my kudos.Roaches and stray cats dominate this complex which constantly shuts off your water to repair damaged water pipes.  Guess what?  If the water pipes break that often you NEED TO OVERHAUL the system YESTERDAY.  It doesn't matter if it puts the complex into debt the city should require the repairs to allow them to operate.A campaign to feed anti-freeze to the cats would help build community.
1	I wouldn't even give this place 1 star. They are horrible people. My father lived here and passed away. After a verbal agreement to clear out his apartment when I flew In for his funeral I got there and they were painting the apartment all his stuff was gone!!!!! They did whatever they wanted to with it and that should have been my choice! What kind of people do that to others? I did alot of research when trying to track down someone who would at least apologize, to find out this place is owned by a Christian relief service. Really? A Christian relief service....wow! (This review is written based on my own opinion, experience, and research)
4	After some initial problems at this property which have all at this time been resolved to my satisfaction I have had pleasant stay and I intend on staying for another year, Thank  you Sylvia
