5	I've dealt w/ Mr. Kearns numerous times and he is a polite and straight to the point agent. Gavish employees and associates are polite and helpful people that I've ever met since my transactions w/ them started and closed. This Company is FABULOUS compare to other companies I've dealt with. I referred several clients to them who are also very happy and will continue to do so.
5	I've worked with Troy for many years now.  He is an excellent agent and always has had my best interest in mind.  He is extremely knowledgeable and well versed in the real estate industry.  I would highly recommend Troy and his staff!
5	Troy is the MAN!  He did an excellent job for us when listing our LV property this quarter.  He helped us price it right, negotiated well on our behalf, served as our intermediary with our exiting tenant and the new buyer, and kept us informed along the way.  His team at Gavish is great as well.  Best of all, he got us a full price offer within a few days of listing and closed in less than 45 days!  Great job, Troy. You did a great job for us!  Thanks!
