1	The worst. They tried to have my car towed for parking in their "delivery spot" that was marked with a sign so small you'd need binoculars to see it. Not cool.
1	This is by far the worst UPS store I have dealt with. A package was not delivered to my work because it didn't have a suite number on the address, a suite number is not necessary because we have a front desk that handles deliveries. Then they mailed me a letter stating that I had to go to Middleton to pick it up or they would send it back to the store. I live no where near Middleton and refuse to pick it up. So hope and pray that you do not have to deal with this store.
