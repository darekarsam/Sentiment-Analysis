5	I came here after having gone to three car washes, a detailing place and two muffler shops. I had a very suspicious odor coming from under my car: dead animal.maybe. these two young men who work here went out of their way to help me. I mean they figured out a way even.with out a water pressure thingy. I would travel all the way over here again just for the awesome customer service!!! Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!
4	My son and I like to take our cars here for the very inexpensive wash. It is a "touch-less" wash that comes with a FREE vacuum after the fact. Can't really beat the price of $6.00 for the basic, and up to $10.00 for additional services. I don't find the extra $4.00 worth any of the services that they offer for that money.
4	I seriously love this place. The prices range from $6-$10.  There is a person that pre-washes your car for you and there used to be one that dries it for you, but not anymore(hence why I had to dock 1 star). The car wash itself does the job it's supposed to. My car was filthy dirty but it came out looking brand new. The vacuums are free and there used to be a separate machine to run your mats through but I guess they don't have that anymore.Overall, it's a nice place to come get your car washed, but be prepared to dry and vacuum yourself!
