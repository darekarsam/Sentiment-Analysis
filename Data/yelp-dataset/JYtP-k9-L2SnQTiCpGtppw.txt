2	I like hot dogs. They're simple and come with their own edible carrying cases. Not totally self-contained like a corndog, but close!While waiting for a plane, I found Frankly Gourmet, a place selling only tubular goodness. Their promotional posters proclaim that they feature the best Oscar Meyer-branded meats. They do indeed have many choices on the menu, from the regular hot dog to the mighty jumbo hot dog, and various types of kielbasi.After some deliberation, I went for a jumbo hot dog. Of their numerous fixings, I asked for onions, jalapenos and relish. Sadly, the hot dog itself was blah-tasting, didn't really distinguish itself, and the bread bun tasted like cardboard*, which was disappointing, and kind of scary, really. Your mileage may vary, of course, so try this at your own risk.* no Chinese pork bun jokes, please
4	Let me start by saying that this was the best hot dog I've ever had (which says a lot considering that I have lived in both Washington, DC and New Orleans).   I honestly wasn't expecting much, and to tell you the truth, I wasn't very hungry.  But what a pleasant surprise.
5	read on a review that this is the best Frankly Gourmet  in town, and wholeheartedly agree!  The neighborhood is interesting with lots of boutiques and cute cafes/restaurants... Cris was tucked away but worth the visit. both the dogs and chips were awesome and very good value as well! they even have a 'hidden' bar which u can enter via a telephone booth - but only from late afternoon so we missed it! maybe next time...
