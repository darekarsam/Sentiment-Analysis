5	This office has a beautiful atmosphere, wonderful staff and wonderful Doctor.
3	Front office staff is friendly & made me feel at home.  I was pleasantly surprised by the comfortable ambience.  The eye-tech was polite and competent although she did keep me waiting an extra half hour due to a patient call.  Doctor was pleasant & I trust he's been an optometrist for years. I was alone when selecting frames and the tech who was supposed to guide me through frame selection provided very little feedback on frames I tried on. She really was not very helpful. I think my glasses would cost about the same at Nationwide or Pearle, etc and they would have a wider selection of frames and much better optician services.  Only reason I came here was due to my optometry insurance.
5	The staff at Advanced Eye Care are so friendly and helpful.  Sharon Rocks!!  We saved a ton of money because they are VSP preferred.  If you have VSP insurance this is the place to go.  Their selection is amazing as well
