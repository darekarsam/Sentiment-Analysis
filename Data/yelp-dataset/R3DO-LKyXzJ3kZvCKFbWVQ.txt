5	Honest to God probably the best hot dog I've ever had. That said, I'm no expert when it comes to gourmet hot dogs, but Buldogis served up a very VERY good one. Will definitely keep my eyes peeled for their truck in the future
5	Grabbed dinner from this truck at First Friday for 2.  Bahn mi dog and carne asada fries.  We're used to getting good food truck dinners but both were fantastic.  I couldn't finish my fries so toasted them in the oven for breakfast.  Still great the next day.
4	Walked out of my favorite bar during First Friday and this truck was just a few steps forward.  I immediately expected a Korean-Mexican fusion given the name "Buldogis" sounding close enough to bulgogi and we were post drinking hangry.  This is so much more! Gourmet hot dogs and an eclectic menu pulling from Korea, Mexico, Thai, and balanced with some American comfort.  My friend and I shared the carne asada fries with bulgogi, it had sliced jalapenos and this amazing sauce.  The spice did not disappoint and the food brought up some culinary nostalgia I wasn't expecting.
