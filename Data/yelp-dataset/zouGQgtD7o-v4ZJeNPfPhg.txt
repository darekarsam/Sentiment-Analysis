5	Five Stars for Phoenix Boutique! I get a TON of my clothes here, for a fraction of what I would pay new. They have an eye for quality...buying used means you know the fabric will last because it's already taken a beating without fading or piling too much. Also, they have an eye for fashionable stuff that you can't find easily in department stores.
5	I've never seen a more unique and adorable resale boutique as I have here!  I'm in total awe of the enormous amount of trendy and fashionable clothing as well as a variety of purses, shoes and jewelery. I seriously could've bought out the entire store, there is so much to choose from and it's all gorgeous. The best part is how inexpensive and affordable everything was!  I wish I knew about this store sooner because it would have been my one stop shop for clothing and accessories. I know it is for sure now! And to make it even better the customer service was outstanding. Very helpful, kind and professional employees.
5	Great quality vintage clothes that look good are always hard to find. Glad the store is around with a great selection. Highly recommended!
