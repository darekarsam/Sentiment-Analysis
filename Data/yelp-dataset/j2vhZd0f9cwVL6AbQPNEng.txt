4	If you're looking for a bar where everyone knows your name, this is the place. A homey atmosphere, some great beers and just enough space to place some pool or darts upstairs.  It's at the top of my short list of hangouts!
5	Looking for a good old fashioned pub style bar in historic matthews look no further...  this pub is awesome.  with a great selection of beers on tap you are not going to be disappointed. The owner is fantastic and an awesome host...If you are in downtown matthews and looking for a quick stop for a cool and refreshing beverage stop by the matthews ale house
