3	Bull Feathers specializes in Chicken Wings, Burgers, and Hot Dogs. There is a daily Chicken Wings Lunch Buffet (and with 6 different sauced wings available, chili, homemade potato chips, and normal wing sides of dressings and celery. Buffet will run you $10, drink not included.The wings are pretty good sized, even on the buffet. The business has never been packed when I have been there, but there were usually enough people to keep the buffet pretty fresh.
1	Bull feathers went out of business. I wonder why.
1	Closed cause it was overpriced and terrible. :)
