2	Cashier has really bad attitude, general Tao is way too sweet and portion is way too small.
1	Colleague found bug in her soup while we were having lunch we picked up from there. Enough said.
4	Ordered the Chicken Pad Thai! Big plate and I enjoyed it!The staff were friendly and prepared my food quickly!There was a guy/customer who was yelling at the employees. When I asked them what happened, they told me that he came back with his plate saying that he didn't enjoy his meal, so they made him a different meal but he returned again so they made him a 3rd meal (all without charging him extra) so then they refused to make him another one. (I completely agreed with them and told them that!)I enjoyed my meal and despite this annoying "customer", it was good experience.
