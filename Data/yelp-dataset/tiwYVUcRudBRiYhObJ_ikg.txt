2	Whilst I'd love to win a Supermarket Sweep in the main HMV, I wouldn't thank you for three minutes of free shopping in this branch. The square footage is much smaller than the flagship store on Princes Street and as a result, they tend to stock the most mainstream and chart friendly CDs and DVDs. We're talking radio friendly pop, rock, soul, R&B, jazz, folk, world music and country and very little in terms of more imaginative genres like psyche-rock, 60s pop, free jazz, americana, psyche-folk, drone or grime. The DVDs are equally disappointing with blockbuster dramas, thrillers and rom-coms taking centre stage next to Disney cartoons and Bourne Supremacy box-sets. Where are Woody Allen and Jim Jarmusch when you need them, eh?
2	I don't mind going into HMV shops, most of the time there are quite a few good offers. However, the HMV shop in the St. James centre is somewhere I really do not like to go. Unlike the HMV in Princes Street, this one is very small and I mean very small. The isles are all bunched up so two people struggle to get past! You are squeezed in like a pack of sardines when it is busy! Indeed, the stock is very limited, all it seems to sell is what is on offer! Different sections of the shop are all blurred into one big collage. So if you want a wide range of CD's, DVD's and books to look at then I would pop along to the bigger branch along the street!
