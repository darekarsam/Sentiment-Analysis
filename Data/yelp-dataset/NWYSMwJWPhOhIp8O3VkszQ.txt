4	We love the Bonnington Brunch - a fab wee place on Bonnington Road that serves freshly made sandwiches, hot breakfast rolls (a variety of fillings to choose from), cooked breakfasts and things like burgers and chips.  Our weekend morning routine has been to pop round the corner for a hot roll (current favourite is black pudding and hash brown), occasionally venturing for one of the many cooked breakfasts instead. Prices are all very reasonable, and a variety of sweets, crisps and soft drinks are sold too.  It's always busy with local workies and hungry local residents.  I only wish it were open later than 2pm!
