5	As a working mom it's hard to get it together for a party. Brandi was able to fit me in very last minute. A two tier party with 2 dozen cupcakes. She didn't make me feel that I inconvenienced her at all. She was super nice and accommodating. We picked up the night before the party. It looked fabulous. Not only did the cake (frozen theme of course) have the characters on them but each cupcake was decorated so pretty to match the cake. But the true test was the day of the party. It was delicious. It was my cheat meal so I continued to eat a very large piece. Book Brandi for your next party-- I know I will.
5	Sent Brandi a few pictures from the web for Thomas the Train Engine cakes and she nailed it.  Easy transaction and communication.  Cake tasted good too.  Will definately be using again for our other son's birthday :)
5	I ordered a cake with Brandi at the last minute for my son's birthday. Not only did she deliver with such short notice, she provided great suggestions for a newbie custom cake orderer. The cake was super moist and was devoured by even non-cake eating kids! I definitely will be ordering again soon and suggest others to do so too! Check out her website- www.cccakesbybrandi.com
