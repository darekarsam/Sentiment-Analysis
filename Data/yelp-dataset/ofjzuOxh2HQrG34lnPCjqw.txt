4	One of the 4 main news channels in the Charlotte area, it's probably one of the best, if not the best. They're news has your normal doom & gloom stories but they try & spice it up with a little local flavor. The one thing I really like about their midday newscast is their center city studio. It's located right in the heart of uptown & really gives a great feel to the local station.
5	We absouletely love WBTV On Your Side Website! WBTV is also our top pick for news & weather!
