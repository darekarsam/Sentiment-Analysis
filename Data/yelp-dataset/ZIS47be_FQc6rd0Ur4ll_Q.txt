5	Josh gives a great hair cut and color at a good price. His hair styles are great. Love going to see him. The rest of my family goes to him also.
5	Josh has been my hairstylist for several years.  I love going to see him for my cut, color and style.  He always has great suggestions for updating my style.  I always leave his salon feeling great.
5	I have been going to Josh for 4+ years and I have always loved my cut and color! Josh's prices are reasonable and I always feel as though I get my money's worth. I have never had a cut as good as Josh does it-the best part is that I think my hair photographs extremely well after a cut by Josh! He also (along with a colleague) did my sister-in-law's bridal party and everyone's hair and makeup looked gorgeous. He truly cares about his clients and devotes whatever time necessary to make sure you are happy and love your hair.
