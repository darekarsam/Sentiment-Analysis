5	My wife had started an in home daycare and ran it for 3 years.  So our carpet took a lot of abuse!  The carpets were in pitiful shape at this point and she was going to start working as a teacher.  I made the decision to hire a carpet cleaning company to see if they could get it looking better since there weren't going to be 9 kids running around our house any more.I looked online for a company (we were in Arizona at this time) and found Executive Carpet Services in Glendale.  I called them out and they did their thing.When these guys finished with our carpet it looked Brand New!  It was amazing, it almost looked like a different place.  I figured it would look better, but this was much better than what I had expected.  The techs were very nice to me, explaining what they did and everything was great.I would recommend this company to anyone!  Great Service and Great Looking Carpets!Thanks so much.
5	Great carpet cleaning company! Tom, the owner, is a very nice guy and gave me all the information I needed. The carpet cleaning service they provide is incredible. I never thought my carpet could look so clean!
5	I have used ECS four times now in my old apartment and my current place.  I'm always impressed and I always get the best price.  THe guys are really nice and they always tell me what is needed to clean my carpet.  They discuss all prices before doing the job and they have never tried to swindel me.  I refer them to anyone.  P.S. my dog penny lovesssss when the carpet gets clean she just roles all over it!
