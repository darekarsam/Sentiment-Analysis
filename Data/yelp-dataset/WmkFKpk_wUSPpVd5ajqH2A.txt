5	These guys are great, even work on Saturday!  I have used them a few times and the do come all the way out to the NW valley.  I was referred to them and have been pleased.  They always call when they are on their way just like they said they would and their prices are fair.  What else is there?  I've had them rebuild a few of my toilets and now are bidding a gas line for my stove since it is currently electric and we want a gas stove top.  Price was very fair.
5	Isaac with his son in law arrived on time. He called per my request upon arrival. He promptly did the work. Took care of my leaking shower. Absolutely alleviated my stress due to the old unit. The job was more difficult than anticipated but the price was fair. Great to work with. Thanks guys!
5	Isaac was prompt, efficient, and most important , his job knowledge.  He took care of our two leaky faucets quickly, and thoroughly explained the work he did.  An invoice was provided along with a parts and labor guarantee.  This is a family run business,and I highly recommend that you call them with any plumbing problems.
5	Issac was recommended to me by the company doing my custom tiled walk-in shower in my new house. I didn't want the old bathtub and shower, so they busted it out. Before building up my new shower, though, they needed the shower valve moved up to waist-high and the shower drain moved the center of what would eventually be the shower floor. I got a couple quotes and iRun was the best. He and a helper showed up on a Saturday morning and got to work. It took them about a half day, including replacing my house's old main water valve. See my picture of the nice clean job they did on centering the drain and relocating the shower valve. If you need a plumber, call iRun Plumbing!
