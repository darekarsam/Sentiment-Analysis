5	Now in my 5th week here and I am just so happy I signed up. Not only is it a great program, but the trainers and owner are awesome. So much better than going to the gym! This class is actually exciting and I look forward to going everyday. I feel great. I also enjoy the miscellaneous weekly emails I receive. They are super helpful and keep me motivated. So worth the price. I highly recommend Fit Body Boot Camp if you want to get into shape and stay motivated along the way!!
5	If you want your butt kicked to get into shape this is the place.  What an amazing workout in only 30 minutes.  I am exhausted after every workout.  They also offer classes multiple times a day which makes it hard to have excuses not to go.
5	I may have fallen of the fitness wagon a little bit. Ok I let myself go and needed to reel myself in before I died a fat happy ball of blubber. I found Fit Body Boot Camp by accident with the purchase of a groupon. If you want to work hard and feel great about it this is the place. The session are 30 minutes which I love but the challenge is real. I have attended three or four sessions and I already feel real improvement. Looking forward to getting back to the physical stud I once was. I look forward to seeing my fellow Yelpers there!
