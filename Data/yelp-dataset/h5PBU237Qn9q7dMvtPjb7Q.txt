5	Love this place! Always have new things coming in and their prices are great. I don't think i have ever gone and not left with something even if it isn't what i went looking for ! 15 mins NW on grand avenue well worth the drive .
2	A friend told me about this place and I was pretty exited about it.. Unfortunately I was expecting more.. The selection is limited, they have a lot of the same stuff everywhere. The prices are not bad but not great either. It is not worth the drive from Scottsdale.  For Mexican imports it does not get better than Retablo in cave creek.
