5	Great service from a father and son team! As a woman it is nice to be able to trust someone who I can take my vehicle to and know that I will not be taken advantage of as far as the cost of repairs goes. I was recommended to these guys by a friend and I would highly recommend them to any of MY friends! Thank you!!!
5	Great place!  I own an older pick up truck that I needed to have emissions checked out, called and they said just stop by and we will see what we can do.Met a couple of guys that worked there ( very friendly) and they got my truck in as promised when I spoke on the phone.  Rocky, is the guy I dealt with, not sure if he is the owner, but very knowledgeable about my vehicle and what I need to do to get it passed for emissions.Came back next day because he needed a few parts , he had it a few hours and then it was ready.  Very happy that he is not a scam artist like some mechanics and try and nickel and dime you to death.  Very honest guy and great to deal with. Will never hesitate to bring my vehicles back to their place. An honest mechanic is great to know, even though I have to drive 25 minutes to get there.Thanks Rocky and crew.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone.

I like the fact that they only fix what needs fixed on the car, they do it well and I can usually get the car in within 24 hours and it usually is fixed the same day.  I don't mind paying for a job well done and I feel like I can trust AZ Auto.
