5	I went to Dart Force 1 today looking to buy some flights and shafts. I can say I've never meet a nicer lady than Patty. All the products I needed she had and at a good price. She was awesome to talk to and in the end I wanted to reach over the counter and give her a huge hug. Love to see a small business like hers be SUCCESSFUL! I will be back many times to come! Patty you're AESOME!
