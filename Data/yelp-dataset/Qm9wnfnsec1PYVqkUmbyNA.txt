5	I have been going to Dr Fauer for about 5 years now and I think he's great!  He takes the time to actually talk to you about what's going on. He doesn't rush in and do a 2 minute assessment.
5	I been going to Dr. Fauer for over 25 years. He is an amazing doctor. He explains things well and takes time with his patients.
5	Dr. Fauer is in my lifetime - the best doctor I have had.  I've NEVER felt rushed or insignificant.  This is the doctor that you want in your corner when something is wrong because he is like a Sherlock Holmes - he doesn't leave a stone unturned and is extremely thorough.  He is very down to earth.  I walk out feeling like I saw a doctor that "practices" exceptionally.  His staff follows up in a timely manor with results as needed.
