4	Great service for quick repairs, reasonably priced and friendly staff. My new spot for alterations and mending my clothes.
5	New location in the mall, better and bigger space. Still the same friendly staff and quality service. Great place to go for alterations or mendings.
1	Horrible customer service and way overpriced. Customers NEED to know what they want because they will not explain anything. For the prices they charge, it'd be nice if you can walk out the first time with the hems actually matching one another. In my opinion a great business man/ woman will fix THEIR mistakes and do whatever it takes to make the customer happy and their experience delightful. This seems far from their motto. She'll make you feel like you never should have pointed it out or taken it their to begin with.I will never again make the mistake of letting them handle any alteration needs.
5	They are fast, friendly and don't charge an arm and a leg. I had to get a complex bridesmaid dress altered and they did a Great job! It was also ready the day after I dropped it off.
