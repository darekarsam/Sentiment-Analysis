1	I had a tire throw a tread the other day in the extreme heat, so I limped in here for a used replacement.  The going price around town is $20 to $25 for a used tire, mounted, balanced, & stem.  This guy charged me $30, no stem, & he didn't even balance it!  The first time I got on the freeway it was like driving a paint shaker!  My next tire experience was just about the opposite, buying a whole brand new set of four tires, mounted, balanced & stems for $143 at Firestone!  (* * * *)  I recommend that you AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!     :-O
3	I was prepared to give a higher rating since they were fast, seemed reasonable and open on Sundays. However,  when it was time to pay, it was $6 more than quoted. I was going to get a tire with balancing and mounting for $30 but after looking at my tire he said they could just fix it and would be only $8, so I was happy about that. It only took him like 10 minutes and I pulled out $10 and was then informed that it was $14 because they had to plug and patch the nail hole.
5	They were so good to me and I was with them the whole time- I feel bad for others who had a bad experience--because the last thing I felt was overcharged- I didn't drive my car for a week bc of what my flat tire looked like after AAA removed it(pic). I'm standing w my convictions and will be going back during the week for my alignment. One dude came over and have me bottles of water - that I didn't even ask for. I came in desperate and humbled and they couldn't have been kinder! Chopo was great- great attitude, &customer service!
