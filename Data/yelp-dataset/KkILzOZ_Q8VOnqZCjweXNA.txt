5	If i'm in the mood for a curry i often visit the Bollywood box, The currys are made to order and are great and so authentic. I would recommend the Vegetarian curry chickpea curry it is great and i usually have the onion pakora which is just lovely.The lovely lady that runs it is such a ray of sunshine to all her customers and passers by.It is so refreshing to taste different indian dishes than the usual dishes that all indian takeaways seem to churn out!

Then I came upon the pleasant aroma of curry and my decision was made... This Tardis like (well it is a police box) Indian takeaway is something a bit different, selling inexpensive curry, freshly cooked and made to the heat you want.The proprietor is a happy cheery sort and seems genuinely interested in how your days been going. All in all the Bollywood Box is well worth checking out and ideal for a quick lunch on a nice day.
5	Of all the places I can think of that do good Indian food, nothing compares to this police box sized cupboard of wonders.I have been here a few times and have never been disappointed once. If you are the type to enjoy your food on the spicier side then you can tell her and she will do exactly that in a way that you can still enjoy the meal without it tasting of nothing but chilli.A wonderful girl who is usually listening to music and dancing about like a loony is your server but no matter what way you are feeling that day you are always left feeling like you're the most important individual in the world. Beautiful little place.
