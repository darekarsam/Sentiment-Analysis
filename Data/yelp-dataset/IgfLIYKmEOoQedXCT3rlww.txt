3	I really like Walgreens brand OTC meds over CVS, also I think Walgreens has cheaper options store wide. I also like to see options so I dont mind seeing one on each corner. I always choose Walgreens over CVS but most of the time I always end up at a Frys or Walmart just due to the savings.
1	This place is so slow.... And the workers look very confused and not sure what they're doing. Walgreens or Walmart pharmacy is much better.
4	I found the employees to be friendly and helpful. A pharmacy employee guided me to the right person to ask a question. And that person was eager to help.and the cashier offered his discount number to an elderly customer ahead of me and assisted her with the removal of a tag from her purchase. Nice folks.
