5	I love The Upper Room!  This is a new church development in Squirrel Hill and a great place to build community and friendships.  Worship is every Sunday at 11am with special services for Holy Week and the Christmas season.  If you have questions co-pastors Mike and Chris are happy to answer them and their contact info is on the website.
5	The Upper Room is a wonderful church community in Squirrel Hill. I highly recommend them! Definitely see if it's a community for you.
5	I've been attending the Upper Room for a few months now, and I love it. When I first visited, I was invited to lunch after the church service with a group of people and immediately saw that the people there love Jesus and love people. If you're looking for a faith community "to do life with," then you should definitely check out the Upper Room. People at the Upper Room also deeply cares about the neighborhood they are located in - Squirrel Hill. As a Squirrel Hill resident, that resonated with me as well. Service is on Sundays at 11am. They also have small groups throughout the week.
