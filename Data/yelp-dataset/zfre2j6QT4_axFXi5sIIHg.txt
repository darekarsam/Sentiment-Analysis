3	I first encountered Pace Print when I was attempting to produce a large amount of flyers for a student society I am involved with.Rushing into Pace Print, I asked the very friendly and helpful member of staff what i thought was going to be an impossible task - I needed 400 flyers in two days. Amazingly enough, Pace Print was able to do it with no trouble at all, which was a pleasent suprise.However the cost of this was pretty high and I felt that if it were not for the speed that I needed the flyers, and I had had a chance to shop around, I would not have chosen Pace Print.For more personal use, Pace Print offers printers that specialise in party invertations etc and business cards - even t-shirts.Unfortunatly the price of all this is still expensive, and while the service is fast and friendly, the cost of all this is too much.
