3	Went here for a brunch with a fellow co-worker. Never been a huge fan of Chez Cora when it was all the rage back in the day but a little brunch won't hurt.Ordered what you see below in the picture.Breakfast was decent. Nothing out of the originary, eggs were what they were, sausages were OK, bacon was good, the potatoes were average, the bread was surprisingly good... all in all... decent.Nothing that comes close to Allo Mon Coco though.Service was decent enough. Prices looked decent but didn't pay, it's was my coworker's turn to pay.Would I come again? Not in the immediate future but I'd like to try something else, possibly their crepes or their lunch specials.
4	have been here twice and the food is consistant and good. i wouldnt even hesitate to return or recommend. fresh fruit and gourmet eggs are my main attaction here and the flavor brings me back.
4	The food was delicious and the service was fast. I didn't have to wait in line to get seated. I find that everywhere you go these days when it comes to brunch you have to wait to be seated for at least 20 minutes. I went to this place because at Allo mon coco they told us there's a 15 minute wait. After waiting for 15 minutes,  I asked again how long the wait would be and they said another 5-10 minutes. I felt like I was in the episode of Seinfeld where they were told many times that it would be 5-10 minutes (Chinese restaurant).The food here was great and the service was fast. I recommend it.
