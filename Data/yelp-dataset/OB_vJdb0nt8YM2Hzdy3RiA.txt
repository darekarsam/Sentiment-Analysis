4	Pharmacy customer service is excellent.
3	I was illin' and needin' a fix. Rite Aid got me the hookup! Easy wit a drive thru so I don't have to get out of my baby momma's hoopty.Okay. Me again. Is that how the kids talk these days? I had a chest infection and after a visit to the Urgent Care where I acquired a prescription for antibiotics signed by a physician, I headed to the Rite Aid where I pulled my wife's vehicle up to the drive through window. The technician took the prescription and asked me to return in a half hour to pick up the medication. It was quite a simple transaction. Cheerio!
