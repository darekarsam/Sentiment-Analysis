4	Bonne bouffe bonne ambiance
4	We discovered this place with a voucher - but would definitely go back.Food : very tasty. The ingredients are of good quality. We ordered the octopus, chorizo, mussels as appetizers and they were all very satisfying. The main dishes are well seasoned and the portions are perfect.I'd suggest the typical Portuguese dessert served in a verrine - exquisite.Their wine list is short, but definitely delivers.Service : our waitress was very attentive and took good care of us. Service was A+Decor : very simple and modern. Friendly-romantic atmosphere This place is appropriate for both small and large groups.
5	Went here to catch a soccer game, they weren't open but others were in there.  Fantastic fun.  Decided to eat there, had cod fritters, crudo, octopus, and scallops!  Spectacular!  The chef was sure friendly, learned a lot from him regarding food and Portugal.  Great experience, will definitely be returning when back in Montreal.
5	Just walked in for a tapas sampler and a drink. Sampler was exquisite ! Tuna tartar, wild boat pate and a crackling sweetbread roll. Make sure you stop by!
