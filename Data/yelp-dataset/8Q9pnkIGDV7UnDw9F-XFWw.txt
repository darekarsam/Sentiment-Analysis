4	One of the best military surplus stores on the east side of the valley. It has every thing you are looking for from a large selection of ammo containers and 5.11 gear to uniforms and patches.
5	Awesome store. Great service and very organized!!  We were told that they may not have enough time to complete our name badges with Velcro and as we were leaving they were DONE!! The store is highly organized and very clean. So happy to not have to leave the East Valley for our military equipment needs!!!
5	Great selection and wonderful service. The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly  to our kids (future soldiers). Will definitely be coming back!
5	I needed a bulletproof vest and they have them.  I bought a brand new bulletproof vest, level IIIA by BulletSafe for $299.  A great deal.  They had different sizes so I could try on and get the right fit.  It came with a warranty and all that stuff.  Suddenly working security doesn't seem so tough.
4	Great place for tactical gear: boots, uniforms, patches, backpacks, vests, etc. However, they have a much smaller selection of camping items and very little survival supplies. The store is more suited towards uniforms and accessories, for the rest I went to Bass Pro Shop.
4	Staff was friendly. Big clean store and plenty of selection. Prices seem to be on par. I would shop there again.
