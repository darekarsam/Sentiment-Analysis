4	I like going to Bombay Bazaar because its very clean, smells nicer than other ethnic stores and the layout makes for very quick and easy shopping.  I never have to ask where the 'Toor daal' is or 'moong daal' is because if you follow the categories, you'll find what your pantry needs :)I also like supporting this mom and pop place.  They're warm and kind and always greet us with a big 'Namaste'.  Prices are fair and vegetable are fresh.  Good place to go for Indian shopping.
4	Having recently moved back, I was in search of an Indian grocery in Charlotte, and Bombay Bazaar was the first place we tried.  Although I'm interested to try some of the other groceries in town, I don't know that we'll need to look anywhere else.  We found pretty much everything we needed, and the lovely folks who own it were more than helpful when we had trouble finding anything.I do wish they had a produce section of some kind (aside from the few boxes of fresh goods), but other than that, they seemed well-stocked.Score.
5	Bought a stack of fresh roti when I was here the other day, which was truly banging.  I just haven't been able to master even this simple Indian flatbread, so I'm super happy to be able to buy a big stack from Bombay Bazaar and freeze the leftovers.WIN!
5	I am new to Charlotte, NC and needed a good place to shop for Indian cuisine. I found this place from this website.  The store is clean, they have a great variety of products. The prices are affordable and not expensive. They have a small freezer section, but I'm sure most will find what they are looking for. I have shopped in larger stores than this but for the most part all of what I needed was there. I highly recommend shopping here. I will definitely shop here again. Check um out folks!
