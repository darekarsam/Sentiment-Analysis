4	After a 7 mile bike ride with toddler in tow we came across this wee deli nestled upon the shore. Very good location and the weather was nice so we ate outside which made for a very pleasant experience indeed. I am feeling generous as I am aware of how difficult it is to keep new businesses afloat. I ordered the brisket sandwich which had horseradish mayo and some slaw. In my opinion it was a bit a dry, I didn't hesitate to ask for a dollop more of the beautiful mayo and some onions to give it a little extra kick. The owner obliged and after said adjustments I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich. My better half ordered the club sandwich which was really tasty. It had 3 layers of very hearty sourdough and some cheese which I am going to say was jarlsberg. Then a trio of meats, pastrami, turkey and bacon all smothered in mayo and tomatoes. We split both sandwiches so we could both have the best of both worlds.I like the feel of this place. The owners were very nice and welcoming and the location is really nice.
