2	Didn't havana go out of biz? I think this is the place with the purple awning. If not, oops! This place is OK. It does have a swanky feel and the martini's are OK but overall it is nothing special. Usually the place is very empty compared to the other bars on Ellsworth.
3	I hope this place is still open!  It was cool, until they got the Touch Screen game at the bar.  There were great times at this place back in the day...  The mojitos were great, the Ricos awesome, and the stoli V and ginger rocked!  This is the 2nd bar I ever got into a fight with someone, an ex and I had a screaming match in the garden...  We're friends now, but I'll always remember that fight in the garden!
4	This place is closed. It used to be one of my favorites, but is now occupied by Spin - a high-end gay bar (glad it at least turned into gay bar if Havana was going to go out of biz).
