4	Much better than the one in Chinatown. They have the fermented chives in the sauce section which adds an amazing flavour to your dipping sauce. The interior decor is pretty good and the spacing is great.The service, however, is not very efficient given they only have 2-3 waiters, even during dinner time.
4	This is a popular franchise restaurant from China ...good price and good food,all you can eat,and the soft drink too....compare with the one in China town..I like hotpot this one in Brossard...the service is good and cheaper than Chinatown ...I like here!
