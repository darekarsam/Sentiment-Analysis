5	Holy Donuts this guy is good! First, he stayed open on a Friday afternoon of a three day weekend to help me. Second, he was able to do the root canal without pain. Third, he was sensitive to me and my needs. Amazing!
4	He was ok. My son had a root canal. The pain medicine started to wear off half way thru so he gave him more, but my son was still in a lot of pain.  He did give an Rx for him to take before the surgery so it could kick in before the other wore off completely.
5	Can't say enough about Dr. Thompson, he's the best I've been to. So much better service, so much more concern and so much better treatment than my regular dentist that referred me to Dr. Thompson.I was dealing with a long term problem and in a lot of pain when I scheduled an emergency appointment with my regular dentist he didn't do anything to relieve the pain or try and figure out what was going on. He just wrote me a referral and sent me on my way. When I called Dr. Thompson's office they adjusted their schedule to get me in and immediately tried to come up with a plan to help me deal with the pain. I had not even been treated by Dr. Thompson yet, and he was much more concerned about my situation than my regular dentist was.The root canal done by Dr. Thompson was so much easier than the first one I had done at my regular dentist. Dr. Thompson made it much more comfortable and much more efficient with this time during the procedure.The day after the treatment by Dr. Thompson I received a call from his office checking on me which I've never had from my regular dentist. He also called me back late on a Friday evening to answer a question.I highly recommend Dr. Thompson and Litchfield Endodontics. I wish I could find a regular dentist of his caliber.
