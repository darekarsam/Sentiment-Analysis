3	Perfect location if you are going north on Park Road or east on Woodlawn. Easy right turn in. It had exactly what my thirsty car needed...gas. I didn't go in...who does when it takes your card at the pump?Now, it's not attached to a McDonald's like the other gas station across the street, but it does offer a car wash or a Chick-fil-A or Starbucks next door.
3	Yup, they have gas. I've only run inside the convenient store section once and they had the typical sodas, snacks, etc. Pros:1) The pumps function2) The pumps take credit/debit cards3) The location is prime if you're running around the Park Rd/Woodlawn area4) Car wash! Cons:1) The traffic can be ridiculous near the intersection so it can be a hassle to turn in.2) Because of its prime location (and proximity to another gas station across the street), the per gallon price can be inflated.
3	I was able to get a receipt from the machine... That, alone, makes me like this place... Seems like it's just a regular old gas station outside... I didn't see the little things you can wash your windshields with... I may have looked on the wrong side of the pump, though...
