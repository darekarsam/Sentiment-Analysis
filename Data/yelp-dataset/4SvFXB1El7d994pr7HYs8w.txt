2	This place has decent food, but the quality of the service needs a lot of tweaking. Something that I found surprising is the lack of English in their menus even if most of the clients are tourists who come to visit the Fine Arts Museum, they have their menu in French printed on the disposable place mats but no English in sight. I was sitting next to a big table with visitors from India and they were having a hard time with the menus. The staff  was kind of aloof and reluctant to help them. Printing a menu in English on the other side of the place mat would have helped a lot. I was there with a friend, we ordered coffee and some pastries and the food was served without a single paper napkin, the waiter came brought the food and disappeared. This is not exactly a place where I am inclined to return.
4	Super expensive, but very good quality as well. Service is hit or miss, and in my experience it changes whether you speak English or French.
3	They do make a good product at this bakery but I am very turned off by the prices.  I stopped in for breakfast one morning on the way to work and paid a small fortune.  I opted for a trio which included a croissant, juice and filtered coffee and that came to nearly $7.  If I had gotten something like a latte or a cappuccino I would understand but a small filtered coffee?  While I did enjoy the food the prices make me not want to come back and try their other products.
