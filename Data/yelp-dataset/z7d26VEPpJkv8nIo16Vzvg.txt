5	Received their news advertisement in the paper, and after seeing a great deal on bed linen i decided to stop in. Dont let the strip mall look fool you as it did me all these years. Once you walk in its like a upscale ROSS. Neatly Organized. Deals everywhere you turn. Friendly employees who dont mind helping you out if they are during a task. And the Cashiers are knowledgeable enough to know how to ring up the sale price if it doesnt come up without asking for a Manager. Yes i signed up for the Rewards program i am now a fan of Anna's. They sell a whole gamut of items. From Bedding to Housewares to kitchen items and bathroom items, and the bath towels so soft and only 4.99. I definitely will be visiting Anna's in the near future.
5	What you need they have it and at a much better price. They have sales for you, however I find their everyday prices are Super on my budget. Its a small store so there are times when there is a line at the register. However when You realize how much you have saved you won't care!!  Knick knacks are often outside or by the counter, they make great gifts and won't dent your budget.
5	Absolutely love this Annas!! They have amazing choices and are always adding new choices appropriate for each new season!
