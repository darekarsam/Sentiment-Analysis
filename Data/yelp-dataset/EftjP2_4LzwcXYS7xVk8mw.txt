2	We came here recently for a birthday dinner for a friend. I wanted to like this restaurant. I forgave them for the tasteless pea soup starter (which my friend described as something you might find in a prison cafeteria)and waited optimistically for the main course. Unfortunately, my steak tartare and my fries seemed to be in direct competition with each other for the title of The Saltiest Part of My Meal. It's really too bad because this place would be great if they stepped up their food game.
4	It's actually surprisingly good for a BYOB.  The prices are reasonable and the food is good.  The cream of mushroom soup I ordered was so so but everything else more than made up for it.
