5	If there is one thing I want you to take away from this review, it's fishcakes.Obviously I ~could~ talk about their rice 'n' peas, their perfectly-fried plantain or any variety of awesome dishes, but holy moly, the fishcakes are one of the most delicious things you can eat in Montreal and you can quote me on that. Like, genuinely. Genuinely you can walk in there and say "Kim said that the fishcakes are one of the most delicious things in Montreal" and they won't know who you're talking about or anything, but you'll probably get the fishcakes if you ask for them and they're really delicious.They come in orders of three, so you're going to want at least two orders, but you might as well get five or six because why the heck not? You can afford it, they're like $3.50/3, plus you can put them in the fridge and they are just as good cold.Fishcakes!
