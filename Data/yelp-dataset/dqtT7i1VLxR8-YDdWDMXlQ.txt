5	This theatre has ruined other theatres for me. I have never sat in seats so comfortable, and had so much leg room - ever. The way the theatre is designed is that the screen is oriented downwards of you (even if you're in the front row) but the screen still faces towards you. It allows for unobstructed views and unbridled comfort. I wish all theatres were designed this way.
4	While I prefer the Paramount cinema downtown,  this place rocks for 2 reasons.Matinee IMAX for $8 everyday before Free indoor parking.While they don't offer certain perks like scene points, online purchases with seat selection, or even paying via a credit card, it's still good.The earlier you go, the more young shrieking kids there are. But I do admit their games section rules.Arcades, air hockey,  bumper cars are tons of fun.The non reclining IMAX seats are nice and plush,  though the screen is smaller than cineplex.It's on the 40 and l'acadie,  close to everything,  but not walking friendly.
