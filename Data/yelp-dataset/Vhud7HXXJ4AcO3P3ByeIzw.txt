5	Pancakes and bacon - You have a choice of sausage, ham or bacon, but come on... the only real choice is bacon, ALWAYS. Why? Well, because 1) bacon is always the answer and 2) they give you eight fucking slices of it; That's FIVE, *****5***** more than most other places... oh yeah, this order also includes three incredibly fluffy pancakes.The pancakes actually taste like cake; not overly sweet, great bouncy texture with a nice griddled crust. Three of these are way more than you can finish, unless you suffer from whatever that disease is called that makes you maple syrup deficient and need to put away these bad boy syrup sponges.
5	Go there,nowwww!!!!!
1	We went there with a friend for dinner. This was a big mistake. I ordered baby back ribs. All dishes came with a side order of salad. Later on, when all other dishes came with a side of potato and vegetable, to my astonishment, my plate was a huge white plate with some ribs at the middle of it and a piece of lemon on the side!!!! I don't know what was the purpose of the lemon. Was I supposed to add it to the ribs that had barbecue sauce on it? No potatoes, no vegetables, nothing else. It looked like something you put in front of a dog.In addition, the waitress was rude. It seemed like she was offended that I didn't touch the food. This was a huge waste of money. We will never ever go back there again.
2	We had brunch there, I had the Italian hot burger and my wife had two eggs and bacon. Everything was mediocre. I thought if we ordered simple things they couldn't really screw it up. All the ingredients were cheep and i felt like the restaurant chose quantity over quality. I can't speak for the more expensive items on the menu or the pizza. Maybe I should have gotten that.
