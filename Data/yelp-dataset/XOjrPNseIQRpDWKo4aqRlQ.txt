5	These are great guys. They have a playful disposition and are very interested in having a place you feel comfortable and are surrounded by nice people in a clean place. Food is great!  Yes, it's a burgers and beer joint, but it's clean and good. There are other items on the menu as well, so you don't feel locked in. This is a place for non-smokers. They would have been a non-smoking lounge without the laws on the books. Nothing against smokers, this is just an informational review. My only complaint is that I live across town. Since I work near it I have lunch a lot and I'm never disappointed. Fantastic place!
1	If you've ever been in a Pittsburgh bar you will hate it here. They slapped photos on the wall in an attempt to make money from bandwagon fans. This place is as fake as their video poker machines.
