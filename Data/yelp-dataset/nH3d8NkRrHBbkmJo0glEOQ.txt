4	Hands down the quickest and most authentic Mexican food I have ever had in the Boulevard Mall at the food court of all places!! The portions are huge and the prices are great! A wonderful gem of a place!!
4	If you're looking for authentic flavor, but in a hurry this is THE place! My personal favorites are the Carne Asada Fries and some Empanadas!  The fries are so big that it is definitely a two person job!  Everything is fresh and made to order!  Also has lots of healthy options for those of us watching our figures, so that makes it even better for me.  I feel like I get my cheat in without doing any actual damage.  Good stuff all the way around!
5	WOW! That was some good authentic Mexican food. The staff was friendly and the food delicious. The serving sizes are filling and I LOVE to eat! Although I was full I wanted more... You guys got me hooked. So glad a friend recommended eating there. This place is located inside the boulevard mall food court. DONT PASS THIS PLACE UP! I am salivating like crazy just writing this :-/
