3	Good to see them with the other food trucks.  Was able to get/steal a few bites of a cupcake from W.  It was very tasty.  Hope to see them again.
5	Last year I tried to make it over to the Strip District as often as possible for Food Truck Fridays outside Bar Marco.  My first visit was probably the most memorable.  Thanks in part to the Dozen Dessert Truck.  It was a warm day so I was pleased to find they offered ice cream.  The list included options you wouldn't normally see....something vegan, a beet flavored ice cream and then, as if the heavens opened up, a light showered down upon what my taste buds had been craving: Drunken Java made with East End Brewing's Stout and coffee for a kick.  It was most refreshing way to end my day.The price, given the quality and portion was reasonable in my opinion.  Now, if I could just track down that truck again....
4	I had thee most ooey gooey brownie from here. It was as big as my face and I ate the entire thing. Myself. And I'm proud! I'm so glad this truck is around after I gobble down some other unhealthy delicious dinner from another food truck. Interesting note, they also have food food. Like something of substance and non-sugary. Last time I was there they had homemade pizzas. And if I know Dozen, they'll be great! This is the whole package!
