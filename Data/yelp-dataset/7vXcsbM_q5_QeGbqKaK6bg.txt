5	I also agree with the first review. I found 20/20 through Dr Rudavsky, who I also found here on Yelp, and who I also thought was wonderful and thorough and thoroughly professional. And, of course, he is a real doctor, not a sales person like the dork who examined my eyes at the fancy Pittsburgh place. As for the glasses -- couldn't be happier. Saving up to get a few more pair filled. Barry and Evan are indeed the best.  I am a bit of a collector of odd/vintage frames, so I didn't have the same concern as P.D. For me, the prices for lenses alone at 20/20 were so good that I had two other pairs of frames fitted with different prescriptions. And when one of them didn't work out for me -- through no fault of theirs, let me hasten to add -- they replaced the lenses and wouldn't let me pay. Please read that last sentence again. Happy happy.
5	20/20 is the best place for frames and service in the city.  I found them on Yelp after having medicore experiences at so many places, and I'm thrilled that 20/20 came exactly as advertised from the other reviewers here.  Great selection, service, price, honestly, don't waste your time going to other opticians.  Barry is very low key, very kind, it was just a great experience from start to finish.
