4	I am amazed at how much food they give you for $5.  There are six specials and I ordered the one with a slice of pizza, small salad and soda.  I also ordered garlic knots and I think the guy gave them to me for free, since the bill was $5.24.  The food was good... the pizza had a crisp thin crust and it had a good amount of sauce and cheese.  I am still thinking about the delicious garlic knots... WOW.  The doughy pieces are soaked in butter and then sprinkled with garlic and parm cheese.  They even give you a cup of marinara.  I totally recommend this place!
4	For value and variety I have found no better italian/pizza delivery place in Vegas! For a mere $24 we got the following delivered to our door:*($2) Garden salad  - while cheap it was nothing special. You get what you pay for !*($2.95) 1/2 dozen wings (medium). YUM. Again not best wings ever, but definitely sufficed. Cheap and spicy! We'll be getting mild next time.*($6.95) Cheese ravioli*various slices of pizza. The pizza is $1.75 a slice. Very reasonable and allowed us to try lots of different kinds. I was disappointed by the sicilian (I was hoping for a little thicker crust), but the NY style was fabulous. *Garlic knots ($1 per order of 3). Tasty but I think they needed a little more butter. MB I'm just a fat-ass though.. lol.. they were definitely garlicy enough!Overall my major disappointment was the food was only luke-warm on arrival and had to be shoved in the microwave. I live literally 2 miles away so I didn't expect there to be issues with it cooling off too much in transit. Overall the value is great and the food is good. Highlight was the NY style pizza. I love the variety the menu offers.
