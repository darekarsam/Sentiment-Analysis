4	Not only am I a fan of their products but now am a fan of their customer service department.  Over the weekend, someone backed into my hitch mounted rack while I was out on a ride and  broke off one of the wheel holders.  Although SARIS has a lifetime warranty on their products, I knew that that wouldn't apply in this case when I called to order a new part.  When I described what happened, the customer service rep (Sam) empathized and said they like to support their customers and waived the replacement fee.  As I pass by their office on the daily, I was able to stop in and pick it up on the way home.  It is these little things that go a long way in my book.....
