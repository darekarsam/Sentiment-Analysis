2	Sorry Caprice, I grew up on you but then realised I grew out of you too. Brocolli in your minestrone can be forgiven (it was good minestrone), and your pizza bases are delicious, but you use cheddar instead of mozzarella (which makes for an awful flavour and also creates pools of grease that just makes it vile to eat) and every time I went, were incredibly stingy with your toppings. Unless you have changed in the last few years since I last tried you, I won't be back.

I imagine there's more on the menu that we would like.The pizza bases were thin and crispy. The tomato base was tasty but I think that might have been where they lost a bit of an edge. If you ask me it could have done with a little bit more of a tang. The cheese and toppings rounded it off for a great tasting pizza. I've read reviews about their delivery taking terribly long but we literally live over the bridge from them so decided to collect. So maybe I would hesitate if you're planning on a delivery and suck it up and go and pick them up :)
