4	the women who work here are extremely nice and helpful.  adjusting for the extra special care they give me due to the frequency of my visits, i'd still say they are particularly swell.  i ran in quickly to grab a gift and got seduced by a peanut butter button.  i had never seen this thing before but was offered one to sample; a delicious mixture of peanut butter and confectioner's sugar covered in milk chocolate...this led to a purchase...which led to more consumption than was necessary throughout the day...a discussion of the button over dinner with our very swanky friends...and finally a craving for the rest of the buttons which are waiting patiently for me at work...if you give a girl a chocolate...
3	My dad always used to come in here to get our Valentines Day chocolates as kids and I occasionally remember going in with him. Turtles ftw!
2	Really overpriced candy. I bought a few sugar free pixies (chocolate turtles) and they were good at 60 cents a bite. The pieces are extra small. The lady behind the counter was being run around by two suburban housewives who seemed to think they were choosing expensive jewelry, not candy. The wait was interminable as a result. Overall, there are plenty of better places for chocolates.
5	My wife: 4.5 stars would be better if they made it in the store instead of making it outside of the downtown. My dad: loves this place. The caramels are his favorite piece of sweet heaven they makeMy sister: muy deliciouso Me: hard to not love this place. It's never that busy, so I just enjoy taking in all the chocolate. The dark chocolates are just sooooooo good in particular.Check it out.
5	So good! The hostess mints are magical. That's all I want now and forever. Caramels and pecan clusters are also the jam. If you're in the mood for chocolate, don't think twice.
