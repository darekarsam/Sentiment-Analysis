4	Great pulled pork, very smokey flavor.  Sides I liked alot were mac and cheese, onion rings, baked beans, and french fries.  The cole slaw was very peppery, which my girlfriend likes, but I found off putting.  Hush puppies were not great.  Service was very attentive and the place was clean.  The only barbecue sauce on the table was the vinegary NC style, but I didn't ask if they had other kinds.  Very reasonably priced and good menu selection.  No beer or wine.
