2	Have to down grade my rating, bad service, actually no service. We went ther last Friday June 8th 2012, nobody was around to seat you. A ghost of a person walked around a couple of time and just ignored us, so we left. I will never go back to this joint.------------------------------------------The food at this joint is very tasty. For a first timer try the sizzling platters, its a bit spicy, but hey it not the fake Indian / Pakistani food you get around town. Nice biriani rice served with most meals. Their cucumber salad is also very tasty and so is their beef vindaloo. (It not as good as in the old country, however it is tasty and I can live with it-- very hot so stay away if you can't stand the heat of this dish). Chicken sizzler  and jalfrezi are pretty good for people who cannot stand the heat. End it off with a nice rice pudding called khir (no its not the crappy stuff you buy at the grocery store) and  gulab jamun. Enjoy.One important thing .......go with an empty bladder, wash rooms are maintained old country style....(so be warned) Go for the food not for the wash rooms.
4	Went here during the week for their chicken rolls which are fantastic. Chicken is spiced well and the naan is very fresh. Might be my new go to snack place when visiting wife's family in Montreal. Service was slow, but the food is worth it.
3	I tried this place on a whim, I couldn`t decide what I felt like and I saw it from the gas station. I was not impressed. It was kind of awkward waiting around  for service with only one person serving me at take-out as well as the only table that was occupied.The chicken roll was rather bland and unimpressive but I do have to say that the naan was really good!
