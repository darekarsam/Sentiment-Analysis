5	This Church is absolutely beautiful both from the inside and outside. Stumbled across this by chance when I took a wrong turn and visited it to seek solace when a friend passed away. Beautiful interiors with stain glass and candles. It has a peaceful aura that really comforted me.  It's beautiful and lit up at the night, and opposite the church are stunning views of the Grand city of Pittsburgh.
4	Need to get to Mass on a holy day of obligation?  This church is the perfect place.  On Holy Days they offer a multitude of Mass times so you can get to Mass and still get to work for the day.  I really like that they have a Mass early enough to still get me to work by 7:30.  They also have noontime Masses and even early evening.The parish is welcoming and Mass has always been liturgically correct with relevant homilies.The interior is simple, but their is beauty in that simplicity.  Glad to have an easily accessible church downtown!
