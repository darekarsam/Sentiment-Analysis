4	Frenco has a large selection of bulk foods from spices to grains to dried fruits, nuts, beans and more. Shop selectively. Some of the bulk spices are a real value since you can get exactly how much you need, even if it's only a few tsps. Some of the grains, beans, and other bulk items are overpriced. You can get much more affordable wild rice and other similar items down the street at stores like Super Marche Sakaris. Still, their selection of spices can hardly be beat, and is particularly wonderful since you can get things in exact amounts; perfect if you just need something for one recipe and only want to pay a few cents, but don't want extra spices taking up space in your kitchen.They also carry a small selection of fresh produce, dairy, and frozen items, though the prices reflect the small quantities in which they order these items.  In addition, you can find a selection of all natural bath and body products.  I recommend taking a look at their house made soaps, shampoos and conditions since they come in such wonderful scents. I picked up some cedar and citrus shampoo and conditioner to use today and it smells so good I can not wait to try it. At approximately $3.50 for a bottle that will last two people a month or longer, it's a reasonable price for all natural soap in such a delicious scent.
4	Frenco has an incredible selection of nuts, dried fruit, coffee, grains, & fresh produce too! But I go there for the things you can't find else where; oregano oil, brazil nuts and my next trip will likely be for a selection of essential oils. True, they can be bought elsewhere but I find the staff well-informed and approachable.I also usually also partake of the snacks, yum! I get to try a few things as I can get just a handful of each.
