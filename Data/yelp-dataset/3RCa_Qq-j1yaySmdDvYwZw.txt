1	I would NOT recommend seeing Dr. Saunders ever for foot problems!l!!! He spoke to us with sarcasm and very direct with his questions if he didn't get the answer he wanted. He was not compassionate and showed very little emotion unless he was trying to sell you something like orthropedics for your shoes. REALLY!? Regardless of your age young or old as his patient you should be treated with respect and this didn't happen. I will NEVER go back nor will any of my family.
1	Dr. Suykerbuyk was awesome and friendly and had gone to him for years for terrible ingrown toenails... Unfortunately they kept coming back so I went to Dr Saunders. He was so insulting and sarcastic and degraded me (being a brand new young nurse) His medical care was good, my toe healed but I will never go again because I was so insulted, and I am not a sensitive person. He needs to learn professionalism.
