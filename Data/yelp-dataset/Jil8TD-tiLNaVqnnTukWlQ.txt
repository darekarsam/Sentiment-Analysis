5	Wild Purveyors are provisioners of locally sourced and foraged fruits, vegetables, meats and cheeses, specialty foods and all manners of interesting edibles.  Brothers Tom and Cavan Patterson, and step brother Clark are genuinely nice guys with a passion for all things local.Give them a call, or go visit their retail store in Lawrenceville (53rd & Butler Street)
4	Thank goodness these great guys set up shop in Lawrenceville, and thank goodness I was lucky enough to stumble in. The selection of cheese is impressive, and they know their local foods thoroughly. I can't help but love that we heeled out for 30 minutes over great mushrooming locations, cheese making, and cider production. Worth a trip. Only complaint is that the selection could be better.
5	Great selection and some of the nicest knowledgeable people. If your looking for a hard to find ingredient just ask. Matt, Tom and Cavan have a great thing going in a up and coming spot that is hopefully around for years to come.
