4	Nice people, and they never screw up my tailoring. Whenever I ask for an item to be done at a certain time they will get it done. Then I tell them I don't need it that fast and wait at least two weeks before picking it up. I wish the Taco Bell was still close by.
2	The good: The ladies who run the registers are personable and helpful. Also, if you live in the area, it's certainly convenient. The alterations are well done. The bad: Their alterations manager won't give you an estimate for the work before he does it. Not even a ballpark. So basically, you drop your clothes off, cross your fingers, and hope for the best. Expect the work (even something simple like hemming) to take more than a week, and cost a fair amount. In summary: Good work, friendly but slow service, expensive. If it weren't so convenient I doubt I'd go back.
3	I've taken things here a few times over the years. It's in a convenient location, the staff is friendly, and the clothing always looks great. My big issue is that the employees stand directly outside and smoke. This looks awful and smells awful- especially when it blows in the front door choking you while you wait in line. I have no idea how they manage to keep the clothing from reeking (or maybe I've just gotten lucky). I could certainly come here more than I do, but I despise walking through a cloud of smoke every time.
