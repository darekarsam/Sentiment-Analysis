5	Super easy to schedule an appointment. They confirmed with me via text and phone.The Nurse was SO NICE. She was quick and professional, and she made me feel comfortable.The Doctor (whose name I don't have in front of me), was extremely helpful, listened to all of my concerns, and got me a better fitting pair of contacts then my previous pair. The first set we tried on didn't feel that great, and rather than try to persuade me to buy something I didn't need, she took the time to re-size me and get me squared away. She also explained everything very clearly to me in a timely fashion.The assistant helping me at the end was quick, professional, and got me a better deal on my contacts. I will definitely be returning to replace my old frames!
5	Best eye care experience ever!!The front desk was SO Helpful & nice.The Doctor was friendly and answered all my questions in medical terms so I could understand WHY, which I love. The owner who sells glasses and fits frames was a professional, I told him what style I was looking for, he pulled his top 3, but the 1st one he pulled ended up being the ONE!! I didn't know it till I tried on every other frame I liked, just to be sure, and he was right!! SKILLS ! 6 months later I'm still in love with my frames!! :)Plus, I saved hundreds of dollars on my frames thanks to a Groupon offer!
5	This is a great place! The staff is professional & friendly. The doctor was professional and congenial. Amanda was very helpful in sorting out my insurance. I was walked through the options and costs needed to supply my corrective lenses. The staff was very patient and more than willing to offer alternative and varied solutions. I heartily recommend this location.
