5	Scott has impeccable eye for composition and detail. What I think really sets him apart from other photographers, however, is his seemingly effortless ability to make the subjects comfortable and relaxed. It remains a mystery to me how he manages to speak in a way that calms any nerves, but however he does it, he's doing it perfectly. Highly recommend if you're looking for great photos and a great experience.
5	Best photographer i've ever seen! Not only are the images excellent but he is great with people (a must in awkward family gatherings like weddings). He is fun, kind and fades into the background so well that you are always surprised he was there to capture the perfect moment. I wouldnt hire anyone else, and i know people who regret hiring affordable over quality. Wedding pictures last forever :).
5	When my fiance and I started planning our wedding I told him the most important part to me were the photos and he showed me Scott's blog. He had met Scott previously and knew he had wanted to work with him someday. Scott's photos are beautiful and you can tell the love he has for his work. Rather then your normal posed engagement  shoots, Scott does beloved sessions. Prior to our engagement shoot we filled out a questionnaire about our partner and picked out a couple sweet things (exchange love letters, make a promise to the other, and share a song that reminds you of the other) from a list to do during our shoot. At first we were uncomfortable with the thought of sharing intimate thoughts in front of someone but Scott immediately put us at ease and everything flowed so well. Scott has an amazing personality and we cannot wait for him to do our wedding photos in March.
5	The best of the best! My pictures speak for themselves! I love them. Scotty is so professional and so great to work with, we loved having him at the wedding too!!!
