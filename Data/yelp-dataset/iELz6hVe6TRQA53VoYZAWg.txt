5	I felt perfectly at home here. It reminded me of some of my favorite bars here in Brooklyn. Perfectly dark, random decor, good beers on tap, awesome happy hour specials, and a really great bartender with good conversation (even if she couldn't understand half of my broken French and I couldn't understand her English).
3	This bar is OK.  That's about all I can say about it.  Not sure why everyone's so excited, as it seemed like just another bar.  Free wifi, though.
