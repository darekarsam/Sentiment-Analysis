5	This tailor is great!  I took several shirts and three sport jackets.  He pays close attention to detail and it was a very quick turn-around time.  Highly recommended!

5	Fantastic tailor! My husband and I get most of our clothes tailored and Piper Glen Tailors have not failed us. From my husband's suits,  shirts, slacks, and jackets to my dresses, pants, skirts and shorts, they've always done an excellent job. The prices are very reasonable and there is great attention to detail. Just this week, a button came off one of my husband's blazers and I was planning on dropping it off at the tailors to have them repair it (I didn't have navy thread to do it myself). She asked me to wait a few minutes and next thing you know, she was handing me back the repaired blazer and opening the door for me. She didn't even charge me for it and upon inspection, she did an excellent job - the stitches were very small, the thread matched perfectly, and there was the right amount of tension in the stitches (functioning buttons that are sewn on too tightly will often lead to tearing of the fabric, which is even worse than just a loose button). We're so happy to have found such a reliable tailor!
4	The work is great but a bit pricey for a 5 day turn around on a dress hem ($35 to take it up about two inches.)  The staff is super friendly and very skilled. I will probably only take really nice articles there as they do charge more. Also, they are no longer located next to Trader Joes, but now in Robinson Farms next to Bradshaws.
