5	Pacific Tan is Great, it's right by my gym and the people who work there are DELIGHTFUL! There's plenty of parking, and the place is clean and fabulous. When I have to get a man-fabricated tan this is where my heart is.
5	Great tanning place. Clean, good customer service. Excellent location.I tan twice a week or so and it is always a good experience.I did a lot of research before I actually decided to select a tanning spot. Price and results are top notch here. Totally recommend it.
1	Not that impressed, went here while they were promoting free tanning services one week, the lady put me in the versa spa spray tanning booth, I felt like I was whiter than when I stepped in. They weren't very friendly seemingly because I didn't have a membership. Not getting one after that.
2	I've been going there for years but just switched to another place. Their new hours are terrible.  If your don't go for a couple months they make you buy another package to get back any unused tanning sessions. I was deployed and couldn't tan.  Bad customer service.
4	Been using their services since they opened and never had a complaint.  They have affordable packages for those that don't like to tan too often. I always get the sampler which lasts me about 6-8 weeks for $100 which has 3 spray tans & like 5 or 6 tanning bed sessions from level 3 to 5. You must MUST shower and scrub without using any lotion,  oils,  moisturizer to get the best results for the spray tanning booth. Otherwise u will be wasting your money.  Spray tan looks great for about a weekAlso buy your tanning lotion online or at sallys,  they are all the same. I dislike the fact that all these places have super expensive tanning lotions with fancy names. Other than this which is optional I like this place but have one suggestion: SMILE more often guys... :) your customers will appreciate it
