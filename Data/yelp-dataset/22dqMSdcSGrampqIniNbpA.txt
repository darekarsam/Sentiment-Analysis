1	Bought Groupon.  Product did not arrive.  Company did not answer phone.  Left several messages in voicemail.  No response.  The worst.
1	If I could give them zero stars that is what they would get.  This company is terrible!  I ordered a 5 day juice cleanse.  I paid $155 for the product and then a previosuly undisclosed hefty shipping fee that took the total purchase close to $200.  To date I have gotten nothing!  They don't answer the phone and if you are lucky enough to get the voicemail they don't call back.  They also do not respond to email, except for an auto-generated we will get back to you email.  After 3 months of trying to reach someone I am filing a complaint with Groupon and I want a refund.
1	Sorry got this place mixed up with livin juicy. Trying to figure out how to delete the review.
