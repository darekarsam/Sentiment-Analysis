3	This is a good, basic pizza joint (for Pgh). The pizza was hot and fresh and served relatively quickly. The cheese was a little overloaded. The crust was more chewy than crispy which is typical for Pittsburgh.The seems to be pretty busy during the weekday lunch hour. Atmosphere is casual. My waiter was pretty attentive and courteous; no complaints there.
4	Pretty straightforward little pittsburgh pizza joint. Hoagies, Salads, Pizza, Calzone. Prices are reasonable, especially if you go in a pie with someone else.We had a couple different pizzas. I would give them 3 stars. Thinner crust, not quite as chewy as I like it. Toppings and sauce were bordering on sparse.Service gets five stars. They did a great job handling a pretty busy lunchtime rush. The place is well lit and very clean for this kind of pizza joint, so I'll give them five stars for that, as well. There's an upstairs dining room and some downstairs seating with a bar. Also, outdoor seating.
5	I go here a good bit. Tony the bartender is outstanding!! I love the pizza, one of my favorites downtown. Its priced good and atmosphere is good. I would recommend it for sure!
1	Don't waste your time or money. Rude service, and pizza was subpar.  So many better options right around. Please dont cut corners on quality of your product.   The bar looked small and quaint. ..maybe the beer is really cold or I just hit a bad day.  For pizza? Na ...won't be back! NEXT!!!
