5	who doesn't love Baguette Express?!This place is great. I thoroughly recommend the coronation chicken (the non-spicy one)  and brie. Ok ok I know it's odd, but who ever thought that ham and cheese would go together!The staff are lovely. Really friendly and really happy to help.This is one of my favourite places to eat when I'm studying, it's so good and very very tasty.
