5	I really enjoy living in these apartments. My husband, my stepson and I all have enough space to have our own space. We also have a laundry room which rocks! And the lady in the office, DANIELLE, is one of the nicest woman you will ever meet. She will go above and beyond to try to help you out. I am grateful to have found such a nice place to live, but I am more grateful to have met her. :)
5	I lived in these apartments for a year and six months. I loved it. It it wasn't for some hard times financially, I would still be there in my 2 bedroom.I had a one bedroom for a year, and then moved to a 2 bedroom..I have a lot of stuff and was feeling crowded.The units are BEAUTIFUL and very well maintained.  My favorite thing about this apartment complex though, is that it is family owned and operated.  Danielle in the office is probably one of the nicest people I have ever met in my entire life. She helped me out SO much when I first moved in, and if I had any issues with anything she was always there to help.I remember calling about getting the bug guy to come in, because I kept seeing baby roaches...she had him come in as soon as possible to spray, and he even set traps out...i didn't see another bug unless it was dead, and that was only for a short time after he came out.  I really wish that I was able to move back out on my own, but its just too cheap where I'm at now ($300 a month in a house with roommates...can't beat that)...but I would recommend these apartments to anyone who wants to live in a nice apartment with a great office staff.  My only issue was the fact that I had to climb three flights of stairs everyday. ;)
5	The location is perfect, quite but close to freeways. The maintenance man named Van is very good . Responds to calls very quickly. The girls in the front office are very helpful and fun to chat with as well. I would recommend these units for sure.
