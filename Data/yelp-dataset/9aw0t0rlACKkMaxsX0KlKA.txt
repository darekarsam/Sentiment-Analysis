4	Who does not love a DQ Blizzard? And I heart the Girl Scout Thin Mint Blizzard. Next time, I will get the mini size. The small filled me up before I finished!
5	Yay!  Closest one that was open since the Greentree location on Noble Roman's was closed.  The entry and exit are a tad precarious, but well worth the Dairy Queen goodness.  If you aren't familiar with the area, make certain you bring your GPS or you will get lost.  Good service and great ice cream.
4	Peanut Buster Parfaits rule! I'm glad we have one so close. Nuff said!
