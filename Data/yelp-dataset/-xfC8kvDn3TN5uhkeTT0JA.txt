1	This place is a rip off. I will never go back. They quoted me a price and I paid it. Now they are demanding more money.
5	Staff is great and Buddy the therapy dog is awesome! Have gone here many, many times with great results always!
5	Been going there for years.  Great knowledge and customer service!!!!
5	Wonderful people work there! You really get to know them and become friends with them! It's my second time going there and it really does help!!
5	Buddy the therapy dog is awesome!  Tony was immediate on finding the problem with my daughter's ankle injury from volleyball and basketball.  They recommended stretching and strengthening her hamstring and quad muscles...gave us bands and exercises to go home with and NO physical therapy necessary.  We were referred from Spiral Volleyball, and would highly recommend them.  Easy to make an appt., friendly and knowledgeable staff.   Was a quick in and out, and didn't have to wait forever.
5	Very positive experience!  Elizabeth McNabb, DPT, is my therapist and has helped me immensely after a severe vehicle accident in July with neck, shoulders, back, and wrist pain, as well as muscle spasms.Liz's knowledge, dedication, ability to find the "spot" which needs help and exercises in therapy to start light, then to progress through multiple levels is extremely valuable.Knowledge, dedication, team work, and energy, with thorough communication comes RARELY in a package, yet Foothills Sports Medicine has it ALL!Buddy, the therapy dog, always stops in to check on how my exercises and therapy are going too!  Nice touch!Liz also has a strength and conditioning training, which has helped my daughter prepare for club this year.  Scary how PE in the schools focus on "team sports," yet rarely have conditioning and strength training to teach the kids to have the strength, stretch, and stamina to play sports.
