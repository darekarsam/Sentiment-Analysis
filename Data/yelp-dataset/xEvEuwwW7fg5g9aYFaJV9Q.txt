5	Best church in the valley, Pastor Matt is awesome and is known to talk about topics most churches don't even bring up. For example equality for all people, divorce,  addictions and much more. It's important as a community to be able to relate and talk about issues that are common in the world. He speaks from his heart, is educated and doesn't discriminate or push the church to have views about certain things. As a church the focus is about family,  real life and topics that we can actually take home and utilize the skills they teach us about. It's really nice to call this church my home and I love to invite people because I'm not only a proud believer of Jesus but I believe in my church as well.
5	Very good church, makes me feel right at home. Not too many people is nice and the band is fabulous!
