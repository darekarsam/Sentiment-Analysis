3	Nice patio, for the summer. Often times they have live music both inside and outside, the menu is typical pub fare, nothing out of the ordinary. I would say the pricing, is a little high up, and a little to much for beer/ liquor.
3	Decent food. Ice cold beer. Chillin atmosphere
4	This place is great and a Kitchener classic bar.  For sports they have the big games on all the LCD screens. The Food is always good and they have great deals everyday.
3	RESTAURANTIt's a sports bar with a folksy interior. I'm not sure if the intention is to look like an old Bavarian tavern but it resembles one.SERVICEThe service staff was attentive, friendly and nice.FOODI had the pesto club ciabatta with grilled chicken, cheddar and bacon. Nothing special but the taste was good and fresh.CONCLUSIONNothing special about this place. It could be a very nice place to hang out with friends to eat and drink beer while watching some sports.
