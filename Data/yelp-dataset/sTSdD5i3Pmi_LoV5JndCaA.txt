5	I love there dishes and I highly recommend you to go ahead and try there dishes! There color, aroma, and flavor are very delicious! I have heard there soy milk, beef noodle soup, and spicy potato chicken are the top best sellers! Also Just heard that there mekong plazza manager will be switching there community tables soon!
5	I ate several times here. Every time the restaurant surprised me. All chef specials are amazing, and I enjoyed dim sum like pot stickers and mini buns. It tastes like real Chinese food since I come from China.
