5	I'm really excited about the Academy of Precision Teaching! I've seen Molly Halligan make great improvements in the learning skills of many children, including those with Autism!  I'm thrilled that the Las Vegas community will now be able to access these services :)
5	Molly has made vast improvements and insurmountable changes in the lives of typical and non-typical children.  It is amazing that she is now able to bring her invaluable skills to Las Vegas with the opening of APT.
5	Molly Halligan, BCBA and APT is such an asset to the Las Vegas community.  I've seen first hand her experience in working with typical children and children with Autism.  She will transform the way your student learns in such a powerful way.  But not only does she have the skills and expertise to make these changes, she has an unmatched desire to help each kid she works with.  To find someone as invested as you are in your kids life is a rarity and a blessing.
