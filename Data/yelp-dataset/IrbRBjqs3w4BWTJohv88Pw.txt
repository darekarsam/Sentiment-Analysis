3	Just how many drug stores do we need around here? Between the pharmacy sections in the supermarkets, there are a million CVS's and Rite Aids and Walgreens everywhere. They're actually more popular than Starbucks!And here's another, located on a very busy corner in Pineville. Nothing special or out of the ordinary. Well organized, reasonable prices on over-the-counter medications, personal care, cosmetics, candies and greeting cards. It is the epitome of A-OK.
3	Great customer service here. I was making my way to the bus and stopped in to grab a drink. I thought that the directions that the hotel clerk weren't quite right so I asked the cashier. Sure enough I was right. I would have been walking in the wrong direction had I kept going. The cashier explained where I needed to go and was quite thorough and friendly.
