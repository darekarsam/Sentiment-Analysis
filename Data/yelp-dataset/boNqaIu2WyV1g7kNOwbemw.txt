5	A safe and modern facility with knowledgeable, friendly staff. They are setting the standard in Arizona for dispensaries. Stop in a talk with Jason, Amber, Traci or Branden!
5	Love this place !! They know their stuff, friendly n jus plain awesome!
5	Nice nice folks, pretty consistent inventory.  Their 3 g's for $45 less $5 for an AARP cardholder is a bargain.  Highly....reccomend!
5	Very helpful and courteous staff.  The dispensary is new and in a great location.  If you like them on facebook you can catch all their daily specials.
5	Excellent service, great edibles & strains. Tho have found a seed in my bags at times; not a good sign if you're paying top shelf prices.  Overall I like the staff, the deals offered, and the way I am treated.Some deals; shake in a tube (3.6 g), mix'n'match grams, punch cards, buy X product get X free.
1	I'm sorry...but everyone who is reviewing this dispensary and is giving them 5 stars is delusional or has no idea what good meds really are. I bought 2 different 1/4 strains from This place and they all blew. All of the meds are super dry and not sticky at all like they should be! Their so called Purple is not like they say it is. I have never ever seen Purple strains that have beans in it. Please open your eyes and have the balls to tell these dispensaries that their product is shit....especially since they charge an arm and a leg for all of these 'made up' strains. Or maybe everyone really is delusional and has no idea what good meds really are. When you come from a family that has 20+ years of experience growing HIGH grade meds...you learn the difference fast. Don't be fooled by this dispensary BS here in AZ.
5	Great selection on meds, Great staff and very helpful/friendly!Location was easy to find,Prices weren't unreasonableand Quality was TRULY top notch, not what people mistake as Top Shelf!Defiantly check em out, great specials and F.T.P. deals!Plus, Traders is in the same plazaso it's a double win!
