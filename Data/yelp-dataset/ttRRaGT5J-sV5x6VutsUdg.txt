3	This place just opened recently and I had to stop in because: it was sunny, there was room on the terrasse and the name made me laugh. The service was dead slow, it took them almost 10 minutes to notice us on the terrasse even though the inside wasn't even 1/4 full. Once we ordered our bottle of wine though, it came pretty quickly and the wine selection was decent and fairly-priced. If they can work out the kinks in the service, then this could easily be added to my roster of Mont Royal locals, but if I need to sit around for 10 minutes being ignored, then there are other places where I would rather get my drink on after work.
4	Nice little hipster joint. Drinks are very affordable. Friendly bar staff. The crowd is younger generally. 4-stars for being a great little neighbor hood bar.
4	Good beer selection. Had some really good food to. Chicken wings were spicy and juicy. They are friendly, tattooed, and won't look at you funny if your French sucks.
5	Meilleures ailes de poulet en ville, belle ambiance
