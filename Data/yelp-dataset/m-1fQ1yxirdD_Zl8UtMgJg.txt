2	Wouldn't do an oil change when I came in at 5:10, the guy at the desk said they didn't have time to do it, but they only had one car in the bay. What's the point in advertising a cheap special on oil changes if you won't do it because you close only an hour after people get off work.
1	Extremely over-priced!  I was quoted over $600 for a particular repair.  I took the vehicle down the road to Farm-n-Fleet and got the same repair done for $315.
5	Had a flat tire late on a Saturday afternoon,  2 hours before they close,  and they fit me into a busy schedule.   Great service,  highly professional,  reasonably priced, and I'll be back.
1	These guys rip you off. I had a coupon for an oil change, fluid top off, and a tire rotation.  I have a scratched rim on my car so I know where it was they said they rotated my tires when in fact they didn't. Total losers
