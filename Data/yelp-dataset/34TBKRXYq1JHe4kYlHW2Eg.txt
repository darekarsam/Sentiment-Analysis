3	Let's start with atmosphere:  This place is an absolute throw back.  Everyone knows each other, and everyone has a common bond, they get their balls busted by the owner.  Jeannie (not sure if this is how she spells is) is a character, and no one is immune to her jabs.  She will swear at you, but she doesn't mean anything by it - trust me you will know if she is pissed at you - that is just how she is. The Food:  Best breakfast overall that I have had in Pittsburgh, from a two eggs, etc. and breakfast sandwich standpoint.  Oh and the omelettes are fricking amazing, HUGE!  You get plenty of food at a solid price.  If you are a coffee snob stay away, well actually, if you are any type of pretentious, snobbish asshole, don't come in here, you will probably leave crying.Best place in town for breakfast, a place that understand that the whole world doesn't need to change in order for it to be enjoyable.One more point:  If you ever get to try any of Jeannie's Italian food, you will be in for a treat.  Anyone who thinks that Bloomfield has good Italian food is a complete idiot who doesn't know Italian food, that is of course unless Jeannie has cooked for them.
5	Jeannie is awesome! If you want a true Bloomfield Italian experience, this is the place.Breakfast is huge. If you can handle all that food for a cheap price, it's good for a hangover.
4	If you were to base 7 Cees as a restaurant it definitely will get one star.   However this place is known as a grease spoon dive.  That is exactly what it is and by far the very best dive diner that I have ever been too.         Jeanie is great.  She will be your greeter, your hostess, your waitresses, your personal cook, your bus person, and your cashier.  whew!!!!  Jeanie is not a jeannie in a bottle. She cannot snap her fingers so that your meal magically will appear in front of you.  She is the only person that I have ever seen working in there and you will definitely need time to wait and wait for your food. Her cooking area is quite small.  Trust me you do not want to question her about where your meal is or how much longer it will take for you to get it.   Jeanie does swear like a sailor, but in a quiet mild manner and NOT like a raging lunatic.  When you come here you will have to except every swear word constantly flowing from her mouth.    Trust me I  hate it with a passion when people swear, but with Jeanie, it is okay. But with Jeanie, you have to know it is coming and it will be coming in full force.  However while Jeanie will swear like a sailor she greets everybody with a kind and sweet heart.  She will make your order the way you want it.  Beware!!!!!  The portions are huge!!!!!   The coffee is endless. The prices are very reasonable.  So why only four stars when it should really be a five.  Well as I mention Jeanie's swearing like a sailor is part of the 7 Cees experience.  I can deal with hearing damn, mf, shit,  etc.  I cannot stand hearing my best friends name being used in vain or as curse words.  When people say Jesus Christ name or God followed by the d word.... I get upset.
4	This place really has to be experienced to believe it.   If there is a such thing as a dive restaurant, this would be the epitome of one.  The inside is dingy, old, grim and I don't think any money has put to improve it's appearance.  It probably hasn't changed one bit from the basement style block windows to the yellow cigarette smoke stained plastic pepsi board that has the menu on it.  This is one of those old school Bloomfield type of places that 's a one person operation likey Rocky's.  Jeannie does it all.  Expect to be cursed at a lot and yelled at if you don't finish your meal.  The food is very greasy and filling, but it is good. This is a great place to get breakfast and it's very reasonable for the price.  This is worth checking out and it is highly entertaining.
