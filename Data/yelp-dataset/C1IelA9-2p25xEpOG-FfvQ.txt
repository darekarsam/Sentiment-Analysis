5	La Isla Cuban Restaurant is a great new place near Matthews. Since they opened three weeks ago, I have been there three times. The owners are obviously from Cuba, and they seem to get a great amount of pleasure in sharing their culture and heritage with their patrons. Tonight they brought my wife and I a dish of traditional Cuban Flan after our delicious meal, on the house. Delicious! They are very sweet and thoughtful. Lunch specials start at $6.50, dinner for two can run low to mid thirties, especially if you add their delicious Tres Leche cake. OMG! It was amazing! Cuban Coffee, traditional Cuban Sandwiches and amazing dinner entrees made by people who are honoring their true roots makes La Isla Cuban Restaurant a great place to dine.
5	Very authentic cuban. Will be back again soon.
4	I have been here quite a few times, and everytime I bring someone new!i love authentic Cuban food.  I like the wide variety.I'm definitely a fan!
2	Quite "meh."  The service was good, but the food was decidedly average.  My Cuban sandwich was just missing something... I don't know if it needed more pickle, more cheese, or better bread, but it was just bland.  I finished my lunch, but I won't be making a special effort to come back.
2	Service was terrible, food was lousy I'm Cuban so I know what Cuban food is suppose to taste like. I ordered the Pizza and the Cream of Cheese next thing I know they came back to my table and told me we don't have any cheese. Well no Pizza or Cheese Soup for me got stuck eating a steak sandwich, well it was not that good.
