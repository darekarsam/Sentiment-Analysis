1	This agent was recommended to us from the Ford Country dealership.We got new insurance with him.We provided him with banking information for automatic monthly withdrawals.For FOUR months straight, he failed to put through the monthly payment.He claimed he had written the bank numbers down wrong, then blamed a secretary for making the mistake and claimed that he fired her.  Then he guaranteed that he would not allow the insurance to lapse due to his internal problem.Then we got notice that our insurance had lapsed even though we had also provided him with a debit card to make payment since he could not properly make a bank transaction.Then he stopped returning our emails and phone calls completely.He did have his new secretary email us that he was going to correct the situation with the DMV...and we have not heard anything since.An insurance agent who can not process a payment, allows your insurance to lapse even though you have provided him with TWO different payment methods and will not return phone calls...completely unprofessional.We are reporting him to the Department of Insurance.You've been warned.
1	Mr. Primm may appear to be a nice guy but really he's just a rude jerk he won't return your phone calls and when you have a question about your policy he refuses to call you back and if he does pick up by any chance he's just completely rude on the phone and hangs up on you.
5	I met Mr. Primm when i was getting my car at Nissan Dealership. He was very friendly and knowledgeable. He not only helped me with my auto insurance but also with my renters and life. The staff in his office are very helpful and always attending to my needs. They truly do care about their clients and I highly recommend this agency.
