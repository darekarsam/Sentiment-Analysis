5	I went here yesterday for an IPL treatment for some sun spots on my face. I found them thru a living social deal and figured I'd try it out. Holy cow! I'm so glad that I did! The one large sun spot I had on my cheek is literally dissolving and breaking up. It's so weird to see. And Adrienne was great! I was a little nervous but she explained everything and put my mind at ease. The treatment itself didn't hurt but it was definitely uncomfortable and she did a great job making small talk and keeping me engaged so that I had something else to focus on. Then when I was leaving she told me that if I needed another treatment (usually takes 1-3 to work fully) then she would honor the living social price for the next 2 which was like a 60% savings...I def recommend this office!
4	I haven't frequented a lot of skin specialists, however my experience at this office was very positive. I purchased two different specials off of living social and went in first for a microdermabrasion and second for a photo facial. Dr.Wanters did a skin screening to make sure that I did not have any serious skin issues, and Adrienne performed both of my treatments. She was extremely friendly and ready to answer any and all questions that I had about the treatments.The results of my treatments were fabulous and I have a major reduction in skin blotches on my forehead due to an overproduction of melanin. The photo facial also reduced a lot of the freckles on my cheeks and acne redness. I will most likely go again for a second treatment to completely remove the remaining blotches on my forehead.
