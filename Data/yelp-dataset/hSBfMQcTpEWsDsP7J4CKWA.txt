1	HORRIBLE WORK they overcharge and don't even know how to process docs properly.  TAKES INFORMATION and then CHARGES TOO MUCH for the work I could have done better myself.  horrible. people
1	I am extremely disappointed by this site and will never recommend Liberty Tax to anyone again. Their $50.00 refer a person is a false advertisement and scam. If you refer someone who owes money, you get nothing. I am so disgusted and angry not because of the $50.00 not coming to me but that I was made a fool of. DO NOT USE LIBERTY TAX. They have no class or character.
