3	Good paninis, decent drinks.  Must come back for one of their phenomenal looking desserts.  Great prices!Apparently this is a perfect place to come as a student with laptop etc... they are friendly and let you sit
3	What I loved about this place was the warm welcome from the staff and the cozy, laid-back atmosphere.  We changed tables and stuck around for a while, never feeling like we were inconveniencing the staff.The food was a bit dull and their coffee was standard. I got a simple croissant sandwich and it was mostly tasteless and wilted.
4	Pretty good food and very good sangria! Didn't try the desserts but I heard it's their specialty.
4	Consistently good food served in a friendly, relaxed atmosphere.  I like the salads, pannini sandwiches, and smoked salmon plate.  Deserts are fresh and delicious.  Two for one drink specials in the early evenings and coffee is very good as well (a coffee and a desert will make a good meal for most).This is a neighborhood restaurant for me (I live a block away) and I go there often.  Between late May and early September the street in front of the restaurant is closed to traffic and they also serve on a deck built onto the street.  By the way, the restaurant sold to a new owner several months ago (April 2011) and the restaurant is now called 1000 Grammes.  The menu and staff are the same but the name was changed from Kilo because the seller wanted too much $$ for the Kilo name.  Kilo == 1000 Grammes (cute huh?).
