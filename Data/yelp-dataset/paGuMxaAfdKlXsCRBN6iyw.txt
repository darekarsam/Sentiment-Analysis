5	I recently completed a cross country move and I was very pleased with arizonalongdistancemoving.com. We were preparing for a long distance move and I was nervous about driving that long distance with a big truck (28 foot) towing a car. We were recommended arizonalongdistancemoving.com and we were pleasantly surprised by the service and courtesy we received from these long distance movers. The charge was only slightly higher than the cheapest of the upack and udrive companies and they covered all the gas, wages, and insurance for the driver; it was a tremendous relief for me. We were required to pack our stuff but, really that was better; I knew I packed my stuff well. It arrived at my new house on time, intact with no damages. The amount that was quoted was the amount I paid, there were no hidden charges. Any one in need of a long distance moving company, this is your company; cross country movers, this is your company; moving cross-town, this is your company. I have ZERO reservations about hiring these people again. Do yourself a favor and hire them the take the stress out of moving.

Thank goodness we found these cross country movers to haul our stuff across the country. They responded to our every need and always showed up on time with the best customer service anyone could ask for.

5	What a relief to find a long distance mover without the hassle! Long distance moving can be time consuming and taxing. Even worse, finding a company to help you make the move can be frustrating, leave you paying way more than you need to, than you agreed upon or worrying about the amount of damage you're potentially subjecting your valuables to. Cross country movers can be difficult to find and can only compound the fear and dread that occurs naturally when you're already making one of the most important choices of your life. There's the issue of whether or not they're proficient enough to get your things there on time, without damage and then if they're going to try and hold your things hostage while trying to up charge you. That's why it's such a relief to work with a company that does none of this, that sticks to their word and honors the inherent honesty/trust that comes with making a business contract. Trico Long Distance Movers take all of this very seriously, just as you do.
5	My younger sister, Bobbie, moved with her family from Phoenix, Arizona to Portland, Oregon (which is the area we grew up in) a few weeks ago. They looked around online and ended up deciding to go with Trico Long Distance Movers as their moving service. Both of us had heard good things about them here and there but we had never worked with them before. The day I went over to help them finish packing and to say our "goodbye"s, I pulled up to the curb and saw the big white Trico Long Distance Movers truck backed into their driveway. Everyone was so quick! Boom, boom, boom! --the living room was loaded up. Whoosh! --the kids' rooms were all packed away and loaded up. It was unbelievable how fast they worked! But they were friendly and accommodating too, when Bobbie asked them to be careful with certain boxes and items (like her cedar memories box and a large mirror) they were very careful. It was fast, but we didn't feel rushed. And I loved how little I ended up having to do! I got to play with my nephews most of the time and keep them entertained during the whole process. These guys were amazing! Bobbie told me that they ended up paying just what they were quoted, everything got there on time, and nothing was damaged in the process. I'll be moving in the next year or so up to the same area and plan on calling Trico Long Distance Movers to help me too. It's a relief knowing that, with all of the stresses of moving cross-country, I'll know that the loading & unloading portion of it all will be smooth. These guys have got to be one of the best long-distance moving companies out there.

5	Hello I wanted to share my review about this absolutely amazing moving company that helped me to move cross country with the greatest of ease that I've ever experienced with a moving company to date. When I first tried them out I was a little skeptical about their services but they really impressed me with their service, it is the best I've ever had in the industry and there was no hidden charges at all, they where on time with the delivery of my important and valuable goods. None of my items where lost and no damages occurred to any of my items what so ever. This was my first experience with long distance moving companies but I will forever stick with this place as my cross country movers from now on due to their amazing quality and service. I think that if anyone is looking to move cross country they should defiantly choose Trico Long Distance Movers for their needs.
