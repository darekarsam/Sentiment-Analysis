5	Randy back in the hitch install bay is great. After another shop torqued my hitch down to 120ft lbs (really?!?!?!) he was quick to get it right and ease my mind. Work was quick and efficient, I would highly recommend Randy and the team here for hitch installation and service to anyone. Great job guys!
4	I've rented a truck from this location twice. Both times they were better priced than other truck rental places. Our truck was clean and ready when we arrived. The staff is friendly. The check-in/check-out was quick.
4	Tip: To find the hitch installation, go to the far left side *when looking from the street* and down to the very back of the parking lot.Apparently this location is the best if you want a hitch installed.  Andy from Broadway in Mesa sent me over.  The guys who installed everything were pretty nice.  It took a bit more than an hour though so be prepared for a bit of a wait.  And... since people are gonna be stuck back there waiting so long, they should have a vending machine of some kind!!!  I was so thirsty  and it was so hot outside that I didn't want to take my baby out in the heat and walk around the block to the main office for their vending machine.  :-/  At least put a complimentary water dispenser or something!  lolBut really, these guys were good and I am happy with my hitch.Might see ya there!
5	These guys offered GREAT service.  Help me in on a late take out, provided great information over the phone, and great customer service while at the facility.  Very clean location, a lot of choice on site with the trucks.  thanks guys!!!
