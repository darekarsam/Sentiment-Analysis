4	A great tasty surprise!After a few bad food experiences I got sort of down on the whole "eating out & ordering in" thing.But somehow we still ended up ordering some food (laziness).My bad-food curse has been lifted!This place has nice, FRESH, grub.Great soups.The only negative I would add is that they tend to under salt, but that's an easy fix and I rather have that than over salted food.I'm never ordering from our local Chinese places again.
1	Ordered from this place and instantly regretted it.  Bad and bland. A must-avoid!! Would never order here again. The best part of the meal was the egg rolls which were clearly frozen and reheated and had a really gross after taste. Disappointing.
1	I ordered from here last night and felt like I ruined a meal. Granted, I only had the pad thai, but it was awful. Felt like over salted brown coloured noodle stir-fry. Very disappointing. Maybe other things are great on the menu, but I will never eat here again based on their pad thai.
2	I often order a dinner for two once per week because it comes with enough food for 3 days and it saves me the hassle of having to cook on a work night. The last 3 times I have ordered I have needed to call them back after my order was delivered because my bag was missing something that I ordered. Not only that but the quality of the food changes from day to day. The last toe times I have had serious diarrhea afterwards and can officially confirm that it is their food :( I will no longer be ordering their cheap food :(
2	I can concur with Adam Z. Putrid diarrhea post consumption. Food is meh. Won't be ordering again
