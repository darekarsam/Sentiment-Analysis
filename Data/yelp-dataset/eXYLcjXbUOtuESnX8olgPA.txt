5	Had surgery yesterday morning for breast aug. I normally hate going to the doctor but dr alexander and his staff couldn't have been more comforting or professional. They made me and my husband feel informed and comfortable about all decisions we made. Went waaayyyyy above and beyond at all steps in my process.Dr alexander, his nurse Lynn, and Ashely are who I worked with most and they were all amazing. Dr alexander called me himself the day before surgery to make sure everything was in order and I had no questions. The anesthesiologist from Surgical Center at Tenaya also called me to make sure everything was good. Overall, an amazing experience, I couldn't have asked for any better.
5	I can't believe there is only one review for this amazing doctor.  I haven't had surgery yet (I am scheduled for Nov 26) but Dr. Alexander and his patient coordinator, Ashley, are simply AWESOME.Unlike the other PSs I went to for consultations, Dr. Alexander and his team really care about what it is that YOU want. They won't just force their suggestions down your throat without hearing you out.  It is also worth mentioning that I found Dr. Alexander through a coworker of mine whose results look fantastic, I would have never thought she had plastic surgery done if she hadn't told me.Dr. Alexander made me feel incredibly comfortable and I have great expectations for my results! Will update post-op.
5	Dr. Alexander and his staff are nothing short of PERFECT! I recommend all people who want cosmetic surgery to go to him. He listens to what you want. He gives you and explains to you one on one his advice. He also explains to you the different ways the procedure may be done and gives you tells you which best suits you the best. The wait time, and if you have any concerns they call you right away. I put all my trust into Dr. Alexander and his staff.
