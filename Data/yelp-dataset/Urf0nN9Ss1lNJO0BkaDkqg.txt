1	The worst ran business in Las Vegas. I needed a scratch on a bumper to be buffed and painted. The man said 1 day....well four days later they are still not done. Here's the best part. They claim to have a "loaner" car. The car wouldn't even kick into gear and is a danger to drive, not only to the driver but the general public. I arrive on the 4th day to pick up the car they said it's still not done and to come back in 30-45 minutes. No call ahead to let me know that it would be a longer wait. Oh yea they only take cash and don't tell you until your car is already in their position. They will charge you just as much as a legit body ran properly so don't waist your time.
5	Truck hit in a parking lot and front end damaged. Repairs to my truck were perfect.  Paint was superb and matched even though truck was older. Work was on-time and on-budget. Loaner of a truck (free of charge) kept me going and it was NO CHARGE!! Thanks Guys
5	OUTSTANDING COMMUNICATION, SERVICE AND QUALITY REPAIR!I couldn't be happier!FREE loan car! No, or partial deductible!Only 8 business days to make my 2006 Solara look like new! I HIGHLY recommend them!Tell 'em I sent you!!!- Gary
