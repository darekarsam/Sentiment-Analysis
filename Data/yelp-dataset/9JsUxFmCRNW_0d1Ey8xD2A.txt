3	Jack in the box serves a purpose at 1 am when you are starving, I give it a 3 star A-OK review. Not sure what's in the tacos but at that hour they are the best ever. This location is new & clean & service in drive through is always good. Good selection of different food options & breakfast is pretty good here. This maybe the best fast food out of the old school places. In & Out or Chick-fil-a blow this place away but they aren't 2 minutes from my house either.
1	I ordered the 2 Jumbo Jacks meals , and my Husband and I got so sick , lets just say we lost 5 pounds in 2 days , felt like we were going to die.. I called Jack in the box and the manager  said she would have the store manager call me, but I never heard from him or her.. I will never eat there again even if they paid me.. My hubby went to the doctor and confirmed it was  food poisoning , I could not get out of bed..My husband lost to days of work thanks to Jack in the Box.  I should call the Food Safety Department..
1	Do not eat here ever.  Tacos were stale. Bread on sandwich was a hockey puck. Ice tea was from the toilet.  I would definitely put this below dog food
1	This was perhaps the worst fast food experience I have ever had. Took 25 minutes to get a chicken pita and fries. Unbelievable. There were two disinterested workers who could care less and this was on a Saturday night. Mcdonalds has nothing to worry about with this kind of service. When my pita arrived the chicken was cold, lettuce wilted and no tomato on the wrap. Other customers had a worst experience than me.v obviously there is no supervisory oversight here. Avoid this location at all  costs. There are better fast food options in this area.
4	I haven't had a problem eating here yet been there several times and I've got what I ordered, its been correct with no issues!
