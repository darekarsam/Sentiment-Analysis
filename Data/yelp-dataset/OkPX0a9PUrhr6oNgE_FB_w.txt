1	This fast food place almost ALWAYS gets my order wrong. They charge me for things that they don't have. The lettuces on the garden salad is always weltered. Besides the staff being EXTREMELY unprofessional, the wait time is always long.
4	Now, don't think I haven't been anywhere. I have dined at elite restaurants as well as common places like this one. This location is very clean yet comes with a bit of a wait. The food is hot and fresh. The staff is very accommodating as well. They have not messed up my order.
