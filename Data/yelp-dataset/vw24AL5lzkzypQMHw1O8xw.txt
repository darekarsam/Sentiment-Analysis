5	Festival of India is the first weekend of September in front of the Knight Theater.  They close off two blocks on Tryon and it's a proper street fair with music and food outdoors.2010 marked the 16th annual India Festival and outside the food vendors were great.  We had samosas, chicken and rice, and shaved ice for dessert. You have to buy tokens to get food and it was $5 to enter the theater but well worth it to see authentic costumes and dancing.
2	This was my first year attending the Festival of India in Charlotte. To me it was lackluster and too expensive. I have been to other cultural festivals in the area that were less expensive and more fun. $5 for parking. $5 to enter inside...don't waste your money as there is dancing, music, food, and items for purchase on the street. FYI Henna tattoos are inside but costs another $5. The Henna work I paid for was only done on one finger and was sloppy. I dished out too much money at this festival and won't be returning next year. I'll just go eat at an Indian restaurant instead!
3	I attended the second day of the festival.  The weather was a bit overcast but it was still a pretty hot day.  The food was fantastic and as always, you pay a little more for the sample size meals.  Indian desserts were available but I opted out of those.  Did a little shopping and located beautiful traditional two-pieces outfits with exquisite hand-beaded details.  These are perfect for dressy occasions!  Note - the music entertainment was everything but traditional Indian; it was more on the funky R&B side.
