1	HORRIBLE COMPANY!   Went to a party where they used one of their bounce houses.  Even after being paid they came and insisted on taking the bounce house early.  Very rude people.   Would never do business with them...
1	Worst company ever. Just witnessed them shake down parents for money and deflate a bounce house and make a birthday boy cry... Unreal. Do yourself a favor and find another business. If I could give negative stars I would.
1	Horrible service. They actually came and picked up the jump house mid party cause of a disagreement. I would rather let the kids play with a hoop and  stick than use this company.
