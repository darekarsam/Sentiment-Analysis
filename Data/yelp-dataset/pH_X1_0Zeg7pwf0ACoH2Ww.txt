5	I came here with a friend after seeing the write-up in the Arizona Republic and boy was she getting a lot of foot traffic!  This is a great little boutique with a lot of cute, casual clothes all on the afordable side and she also has tons of accessories.  We will definitely be putting her shop on our rotation!
5	This store is so cute! So many dresses, shorts, tanks and tees to fill your wardrobe with that are affordable. I love that Eileen gets new things weekly so everytime you come in, there is something new and fresh!
5	Great little store to find a cute dress or a great basic for an even better price. Eileen works the store herself and has a spunky personality and fun style. I never leave under $80, and that is with a bag full of stuff. It is a must see for all Arcadia residents!
5	unfortunately, this is closed.  the owner moved her shop to l.a.to the owner: open your website up to online sales. your $39 sundresses still get me lots of compliments!
