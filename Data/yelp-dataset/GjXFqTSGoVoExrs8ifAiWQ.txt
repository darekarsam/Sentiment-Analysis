3	High prices for items but that's the cost of convience. I like their one hour photo and pharmacy.
1	There are two women who work at the Philo Road, Urbana location that I have had enough of; I won't be back. One "works" in the pharmacy and the other is clearly pissed to check you out of the store. Seeing as how this location is not 24 hours, and there are only about a dozen more Walgreens within Champaign-Urbana, I will go out of my way to another one from now on. If I wanted to be treated poorly, I would go visit my grandmother.
1	I go here to get my prescriptions, since it is close to where I live. The pharmacy staff is always SO rude, and if there was a different pharmacy near my house, I would quit going here all together. Going to pick up my prescription always puts me in a bad mood because of the rudeness of the staff. I may just start driving out of my way to get my prescriptions if the staff doesn't shape up soon.
