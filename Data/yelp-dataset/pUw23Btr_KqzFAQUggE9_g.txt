4	I bought my set of tires from discount tire on fort apache a year ago. I recently moved to the sunrise manor area and this store happes to be the nearest discount tire store that I can go to. So I decided to pop in one afternoon to get my tires rotated. Julian helps me through the whole process, the whole staff made it like its a very important job. Balancing the tires, rotating, adjust the air pressure, the whole nine yards for free. They did a wonderful job and I am glad I choose discount tire for my baby beemer. Thanks a lot discount tire.

5	We hit a curb last week and luckily we have a tire warranty but in the meantime we went to a different tire place to put on a spare tire. we specifically told this other tire place to make sure they give us the tire back so we can turn it back into the discount tires and get a brand-new tire but the darn place gave us an entirely new tire.Luckily the people here understood and exchanged our tire anyway! The guy who helped us was named Raul and the other guy was named Adolfo who fixed our tire pressure. They were both very pleasant I will definitely be back!
