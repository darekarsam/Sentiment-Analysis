5	We just got back from our wedding in Las Vegas.  We ordered the flowers ahead of arriving and cound not be happier.  Rosy did an excellent job.  They were beautiful, fresh and exactly as described.  They were very afforadable as we gave them a specific budget and she worked with that very well.
5	Rosy Flower Event Designs provided the flowers for my wedding on September 6, 2014.  The flowers were more gorgeous than I had imagined they would be and they were delivered to the correct locations on time.  Also, the price was VERY reasonable for what I received.  It was a pleasure doing business with them and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for beautiful arrangements for ANY occasion.
5	We met with Rosy and discussed what we wanted for floral design and the type of flowers we wanted for our wedding. She was very professional and warm. We decided to upgrade the flowers. What a beautiful job she did with the centerpieces.
