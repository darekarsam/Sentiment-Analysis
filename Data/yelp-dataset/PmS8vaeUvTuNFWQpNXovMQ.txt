5	The pharmacy staff is the best. They remember you and do what they can to help if there are problems. Pearl and Wayne (pharmacist) and some of the best people.
1	If I could give a zero review for the pharmacy I would..... First off the store and staff themselves are great that's until you get to the pharmacy. at that point. You might as well poke yourself in the eye with a sharp stick its about the same treatment you will het from them.the pharmacy staff is rude! Unprofessional and cold.the worst one of them all is the one who should know better on how to use customer service the pharmacy manager DOUG! He's rude! Unprofessional and honestly a jerk.never been more mistreated
