2	"Support Your Local Stripper"Found an ad they were looking for a DJ.What the hell I'm new in town.Strip clubs have never been my thing.And Lorenzo's Villa hasn't changed that at all.Nice to meet Angel and her friend CoCo.But the poor Joe Dirt looking dude, or the guy with the old run down Porsche that had to be parked just right, and in front.These girls really don't care for you.At least the match stayed lit long enough to light my smoke through all of this thick desperation.Nice cold beer!!And next time I need a hit of Bon Jovi.You got my biz Lawrence!2 stars for now. Somebody else take it higher. I'm getting dizzy.
2	Not a bad place to grab a cheap beer but this place should be an alternative to chemical castration for sex offenders.The ladies here are A grade libido killers
4	Just a little hole in the wall strip joint!  Yea, we pop in there sometimes to support our local strippers.
2	A good place to go if you want to low roll.
5	In Vegas everyone tells you there's a $0 cover charge, free limo ride, you just need to buy 2 drinks at $15 each!  ($30 total)  What they don't tell you is they will make you tip the limo driver more than you would have just paid a taxi, and if you don't tip him exorbitantly they'll leave you stranded at the club.Larry's actually has free cover.  The drinks are $6 each!  And the girls are very friendly, they are either dancing on stage or snuggling with you in a booth!  I had the most beautiful woman I've ever met in my life on my arm/lap for 6 hours here!  Honestly, you cant afford not to go to this club!
