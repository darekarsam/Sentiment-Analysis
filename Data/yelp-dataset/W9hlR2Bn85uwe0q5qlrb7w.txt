2	The store never has enough employees working. There is usually only one checker, it's pretty annoying when you're just in there for a quick minute. Almost every time I've been in there, the side departments are always closed, no matter the time of the day. Same with customer service. I do enjoy the work ethic of Jon the manager there. He's always helpful.
4	I love this store!!! I live just around the corner from this store so naturally I gravitated to it when we moved to the neighborhood... The staff is extremely friendly and the store is fairly clean and definitely well stocked... The only negative to this particular store is the cashier openings... Because of the traffic this store gets they only have 1 sometimes 2 registers open... Can be aggravating if there's a rush and you just want to get in and out... But overall this is a great store...
5	I visit this pharmacy at least once a month and the WHOLE staff is always friendly, knowledgable, and quick!! After almost a year I FINALLY decided to write a review because of an experience I had last night. Yesterday I tried to drop off my prescription at Walgreens (never again!!) because it was on my way home from the doctors office and was quickly reminded why I use Safeway. After spending half an hour arguing with the Walgreens pharmacist, I came to this location and even though they were out of the eye drops I needed, they quickly found a location that did have them and faxed my prescription over so it would be ready by the time I got there to pick it up. They went out of their way for me and were totally unbothered and happy to do it for me, which was so refreshing after my Walgreens experience. Definitely recommend this pharmacy and their staff!!!
