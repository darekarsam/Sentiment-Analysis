2	I came here a year ago and thought it was pretty darn good.  I recently went again, and it was definitely not as good as I remembered.The room was still very clean, spotless actually, and very bright.  The staff were very friendly.  But the food just wasn't as good.  It seemed all too "precooked and refrigerated".I was a bit sad, given how I had remembered it from the previous visit.
4	It seems like every time I'm really craving Miga, the restaurant is closed. But on those few occasions where it's actually been open, I've never been let down. Very casual vibe with the happiest and most delightful staff in the world. Seriously, I don't think I've never seen them without a smile, and the mood is infectious. The food is delicious and very reasonably priced. Personal favourite is the bibimbap, which is pretty much perfect at any time of day.If you're looking for quick and tasty Korean food, this is where you need to be.
1	Really REALLY not impressed. The food was all of the microwave variety and had no taste. I don't even cook Asian food, but I'm pretty sure if I just followed a recipe for bibimbap, let's say, it would turn out significantly better than what you get at Miga. The owner even admitted a while back on another site that their focus is making food for "non-Koreans", which I don't think is a good thing! No flavor, not fresh, and pretty embarassing to even serve stuff like that and call it Korean food.
