1	Poor customer service. Do not hold to their quote. Techs who come out don't know pricing, neither does the office person answering the phone.
1	Bait and switch: Spoke with service manager who said initially that I should of been charged an additional $18.75 for extra time spent, when I told him I was charged $37.50 his story changed. So I was charged an extra half hour service fee when they came out to replace filters that they replaced for 8 years in a row with the half hour fee, now of $75, which they felt that it takes more time now to change my same filters for an additional half hour fee of $37.50.
1	Poor customer service! My water treatment system broke and so they came out to do a service call $75 charge on Monday. They remove the filter tank and left the drainage hose out instead of putting it back in the brine tank. Rob says we will call you today but this should be covered under warranty. I had to call them Thursday as there was no call back and they said oh yeah we were going to call you and we will have them bring the tank back today. No mention of another service fee. During the week the brine tank had chosen to empty itself through the tube that was left out and there's is now salt all over my garage. I notified the scheduler of this as well as the service guy who saw it. John says it'll be $75 again so I paid as it's not johns fault... I called the next day to speak to the service manager and he said it is always 75 to have anyone come here- even if their part broke under warranty- and all he could say was sorry about the garage but that's all he had. So they suck in this particular case and I'm sorry I even bought the more expensive tank in the first place but I would expect the service would be better especially since all they did was sell the tank and this is the first issue they've had with it.Go somewhere else.
