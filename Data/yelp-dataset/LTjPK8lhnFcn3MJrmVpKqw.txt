3	Very eclectic interior.  Friendly staff.  Food is small plates.  Drinks are strong with house - made syrups.  Good place to meet friends early in the night, but keep an eye on your tab or you might be broke before 10p;)  They will likely be a 4-5 star establishment with time
5	LOVE the drinks. Handmade cocktails, fun decor, and it's a great time with friends. A different vibe from anywhere else in Charlotte, and it's fantastic. Had a delicious Pain Killer, a Mai Tai, and a Zombie. Worth every penny!
5	This place opened just a few days ago, but I really enjoyed my visit. Great decor, hand crafted drinks and yummy small plates. Adding this to the list to visit often.
5	If you're looking for an experience other than just a regular night out, you HAVE to try Tiki Hideaway. The decor is upscale Polynesian...super inviting and comfortable but interesting and different at the same time. The cocktails are ON POINT. Try the Pain Killer!!! To top it off, the food is amazing too. Wagyu beef tataki, tuna sashimi, and the poke are my favorites, but everything I tried was unique and delicious. Great staff and overall excellent service. Have already recommended it to all my friends in the area! Love this place!
5	Great ambience. Great drinks. Great food. I love this place!
5	Vacation while in Charlotte? Yes, please. I took my sister out for a drink and a few bites @ Tiki Hideaway and had a great time. I loved the wagyu beef and the chicken dish, especially. Drinks were on point and so perfectly South-Pacific! Completely obsessed with the look and feel of Tiki Hideaway.
