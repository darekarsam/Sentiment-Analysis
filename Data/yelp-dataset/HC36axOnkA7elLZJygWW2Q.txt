4	We had my mom and dad's 50th wedding anaversery party here. The staff were friendly we had the cater the food in house. it was okay we have had better but not too bad. The main issue was it was very HOT in side. They forgot to turn it on early as they had said they would. The chairs they used were very hard after sitting for awhile. How ever the place is very nice inside and out. It would be a lot nicer if you had a event when the weather was cooler.
3	Great place and friendly service. Would love to do an event here. Owner is super nice, funny, and proud of the place. Really had a great time here.
4	This is a great place to hold an event. I was here for a fun and well attended company appreciation event. There were awesome bounce houses, swings and carnival games everywhere I looked. I've got to try this place again.
