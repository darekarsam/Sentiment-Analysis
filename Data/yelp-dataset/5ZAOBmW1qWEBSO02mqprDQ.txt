5	This is a fine gallery!  "A Gallery That Thinks It's A Museum" some say! Beautiful on the inside and outside!  Most of the paintings, though they are beautiful are a little more refined than what I like, though that is where this owner knows what her clients want!  That is SMART!  To know your business like she does and know what people expect from your Gallery is right on!!!
5	Shain is definitely worth a visit and another visit - visit as often as you can!  The owner has a trained eye - her expertise is quite evident. Also, she is very civic minded, frequently involving the gallery in functions that help our community. Shain Gallery's location at the corner of Colony and Selwyn is a plus. Visit the gallery then have a nice meal at one of the restaurants nearby.
5	I never expected to find a gallery of this quality in Charlotte.  I'm not saying that Charlotte is a backwater city, only that when it comes to art the Shain Gallery's quality is more akin to something I'd expect to see in New York or Los Angeles.The owner is an amazing woman with a superb eye.  The range of artwork she displays is fascinating and openly defies the mediocre galleries with their safe choices and lack of passion.  I've been introduced to many talented artists with techniques I never knew existed because of this place.No matter where I live in the world I will be a life long customer of this gorgeous gallery.  And if you need an excuse to drag along a spouse who doesn't appreciate art you could always send him/her to the Yoforia around the corner or the Mellow Mushroom across the street.Don't allow anyone to deny you the experience of this exceptional place.
