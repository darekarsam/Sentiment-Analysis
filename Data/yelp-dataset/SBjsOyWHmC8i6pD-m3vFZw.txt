5	Ben Hagar is by far the best physical therapist I have ever come across.  I am a complicated case but Ben and his amazing staff continues to give me relief.   I have been treated for a herniated disc and my right knee.  The front office is very professional and helpful in dealing with insurance companies.  The atmosphere there is very relaxed and the physical therapy assistants know their job well and contribute to the success and the recovery of the patients.  I would highly recommend this office.
1	Can't speak to the quality of service as I've been sitting here waiting more than a half hour for my first appointment.
5	The therapists at foothills have an incredible level of expertise and experience working with patients with a wide variety of injuries. I am a physical therapist and when I injured my knee, Allan Gruver at foothills was the only therapist in the Valley I would even consider seeing. The front staff people are very friendly and billing my insurance was efficient. I highly recommend foothills sports medicine.
5	Today was my first day of therapy not knowing what to expect and nervous. The staff is very outgoing and helpful and will answer any questions that you may have.  I will say this I did wait but that is to be expected, you don't just walk right in when you see the DR. others being late does push times back and we live in a world of instant gratification I was more then happy to wait and have made my appointments for the month out I look forward to my recovery here
