5	Across from Mesa Community College, I owe these folks a lot for the sustenance they provide. The veggies are always crisp, they keep the store clean and they serve with a friendly smile.My favorite is a tuna with double Swiss toasted and topped with spinach, tomato, black olives, pickles and southwest sauce. Teriyaki chicken or meatball also solid choices. I like juice and apples, available in the fridge as substitutes for the ubiquitous pop & chips.I recommend staying with the lighter breads as the wheat and honey oat can be a bit heavy. And definitely get it toasted, whatever the meat.VEGETARIANS: There is a quite tasty veggie patty available.Hard to beat for a quick, relatively cheap and healthy meal.Say Hi from the guy with the Hat!

1	Never any meat on the sandwich, and the employees overcharge without explanation. Ive been to other subway stores that are not that bad but this one takes the cake. Will not be going back. It's hilarious to watch the employee count the amount of slices of meat they put on your sandwich and if you ask for extra they put two more slices on and charge you two more dollars. RIP OFF!
1	very very very slow service. The guy put the wrong kind of sauce on my sandwich and rather than offering to make it again he sat there for five minutes and try to scrape it off with a knife and throwing parts of the sandwich away. What a ridiculous experience. And to top it off the soda machine was not functioning properly. WORST subway experience ever
