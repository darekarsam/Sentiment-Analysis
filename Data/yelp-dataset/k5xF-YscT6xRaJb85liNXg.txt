4	They do take walk-ins, but you may need an appointment depending on the day.  I came in for the first time and I was seated as soon as I walked in the door.  The guys there seemed to know what they were doing and it appeared to be more than just a quick, cheap barbershop.  They had great attention to detail, took the time to talk and get to know me (but didn't talk my head off) and gave me the cut I wanted.  I'll be back there in a few weeks.  Men's cut was $17, and worth it in my opinion.
5	I have been going to Nick since 1985, best barber shop in the city!
5	I've been going to Kim for over 10 years!  She knows her customers well and has a loyal base, she gives a precision cut every time, and the prices are reasonable!I moved out of state and still come back just for a cut and color by Kim.
5	Pepper is great!  And, he gave me a 5/5 haircut too, plus he is a military veteran.  Wonderful person and personality!  *****
