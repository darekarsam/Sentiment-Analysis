5	Great place, especially for a family.There is props such as hockey sticks etc that you can use to take picture with all the people and all the people looks realistic.There is also the part where you can make your own wax of yourself and that part is really fun too.
3	I have never been to a wax museum period and having left the U.S. to visit Canada, it was pretty cool to see the VIPs who were "inducted" into this museum. I was excited to see a few American figures or icons like President Obama, Michael Jackson, Ryan Gosling, Naomi Campbell, George Clooney, etc. There were quite a few cool exhibits and I liked the initial digital presentation depicting the evolution of nature throughout the seasons as an introductory piece to the museum. I took plenty of photos and it's great for children. There is an even a booth where you can submit your image to be turned into a virtual wax figurine. Nothing beats becoming a part of the creative process.
