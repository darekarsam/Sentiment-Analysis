5	This place is awesome! First off, they have a huge selection of supplies, including odds & ends that you can use for art projects. It's really fun to just create stuff with weird items and doesn't cost much at all. There is also local artist's art on the walls and rooms in the back of the building that you can purchase or simply stare at. If anything, it's worth a visit just to see what an inspiration looks like :)
5	There aren't many places that genuinely want to promote art. However, this place does! Every time I go there, I find something inspiring and the energy is so inviting and relaxing!I recommend you check it and if you are unable to complete a project at home, you can take it there and they'll encourage you to find your inspiration. Great job!
5	The most amazing place to could ever go to is here! Giving back to the community and finding some really cool refurbished art materials ....what more could you ask for?
5	I LOVE this place! I bring my 2 year old here all the time! It is an awesome place for a curious little mind to create and discover art. We also attend many of the community events held there. Our favorite is the all ages open mic the 2nd and 4th Friday. I never knew I had a little rock star on my hands until she was given the opportunity to shine at open mic. Great place that gives back to the community in many ways!
