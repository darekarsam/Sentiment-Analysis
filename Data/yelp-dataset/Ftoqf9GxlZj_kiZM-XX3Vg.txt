5	We have used this shop two times, most recently for a minor repair.  They are the best shop I have ever dealt with.  Everything was done on time and in such a professional way.  We have been so happy with them that we would definitely use them again if needed.
5	I would like Abra to know that I was VERY pleased with the service that I received last week.I have a 2012 VW Golf and took it to Abra because they are certified by Volkswagen and that was of utmost importance to me; so much that I chose to drive 60+ miles to go there.  Robert was amazing and my whole experience was top notch.   I could not have asked for better service; it was courteous, quick and very professional.  They get a 10 in my book and I will be recommending them to everyone I know, even if they don't own a VW.  There are very few businesses that run like Abra and they should be so proud of their business as they set an example of how things should be done. Hats off to Abra in Peoria and Robert and everyone else that was involved with the work done on my vehicle.

5	Took my car there for minor repairs after an accident  and I couldn't be more pleased. They were quick and everyone was exceptionally friendly.  When I picked up my car not only did it look great they went above and beyond by performing a light interior cleaning. All their work is guaranteed and should I need to use a body shop again, I will be heading straight back. Phenomenal service, thanks!!
