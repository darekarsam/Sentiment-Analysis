5	Dr. Nicks and her staff are great!  Their prices are very reasonable and they actually remember you and your pets!  They have a dog run that their patients can use (we live in an apartment right now with two dogs (a 45 lb and 80 lb) so it's been a great place to exercise them.  They are also open most saturdays and their overnight kenneling is half as much as a doggy daycare.
4	I really like how they treat the animals and their owners.
5	Professional & caring staff who really care about the animals they see. Dr Nicks and her staff all take time to get to know each individual pet. Also prices are good compared to other vets in Charlotte.
5	We've been bringing our frenchie to Dr. Euline since 8weeks of age. The staff is amazingly friendly, they go the extra mile, and it makes me feel very important. Dr. Euline will spend all the time you need to talk about whatever issues or questions you have. She is truly engaged and a great veternarian!I'll miss her as she opens up her new practice in Davidson, NC. :(
