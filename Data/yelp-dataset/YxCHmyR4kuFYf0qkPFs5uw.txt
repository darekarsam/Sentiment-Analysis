1	This place was disgusting with filthy carpets and very outdated. You can get much more for your money somewhere else, I only stayed because it was pouring rain out and very late.
5	You get what you pay for but love the fact that this extended stay hotel offers a full kitchen, minus oven. I enjoy not having to eat out every night when on an extended business trip.
1	This was one of the worse hotel experiences I've had with a hotel stay. ALL of the furniture was old and dirty. The carpet was old and had a funny smell. The light shades were even dusty and dirty. The pocket door to the rest room had dirt up and down it. It's clear that they don't believe in deep cleaning or updating. I didn't want to get out of my clothes or shoes because I didn't want my skin to touch the covers, the dirty chair or couch in the room, or my feet to touch this disgusting carpet. I was itchy the whole time I was there and we left because I couldn't stand the low standards of this property.  For the price, please stay at the La Quinta Inn around the corner.
1	Horrible. No bedding for the couch bed. No dishes, glasses, cups or silverware. Can't get extra pillows or bedding. No plug for the tub. It is a dump
