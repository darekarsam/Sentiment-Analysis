4	If you're old enough to remember service stations that weren't just gas stations, where you checked your oil and tires at the same time you filled'er up, then this place will bring you back.  Maybe not to the service stations of the 1950's, but maybe the 80's or so, before the invention and proliferation of "Git It Cho Damn Self" gasoline.In addition to the ubiquitous self serve pumps and C-store, they also have service bays where you can get your oil changed or other such mechanical tomfoolery.  I haven't gotten service or checked their prices, though.As far as gas, you can pump it yourself, sure, but they are using the old school method of charging more for credit than for cash, so be careful of the price. [Using a Valero/DiamondShamrock gas card gets you the cash price, though]  Nice thing is they don't try to scam you by advertising the cash price then upping it at the pump if you pay credit; they advertise the credit price, and you get the awesome feeling of getting a nice little discount when you see the cash/gas card price!My cherry on top is that you aren't going to be charged $.50, $.75, or even $1.00 for use of the air compressor, like other gas stations nowadays.  The island nearer to the building actually has TWO (2) air pump hoses built right into the side of the island's little wall, one right next to each gas pump!

5	My family has been coming here for 30 years & Bruce and his crew are the best!  They are super knowledgeable, professional, trustworthy, and they go out of their way for you every time.  It's now service only, no gas other than propane.  I highly recommend them if you're looking for a mechanic you can trust.
