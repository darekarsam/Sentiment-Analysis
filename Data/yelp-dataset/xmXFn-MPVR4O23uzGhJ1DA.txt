4	My flatmates and I ordered from So Good a few months ago and although the food did take a while to arrive, it was delicious when it did.  We had a menu thrust under our door during Fresher's Week and it sat in our hall until we felt hungry and lazy enough to use it.  The menu has the usual range of Chinese classic dishes and I went for the crispy chilli shredded beef along with fried rice and a bag of prawn crackers.  They said they would be 20 minutes, but in reality it was more like 50, and they charged a fiver at the door for it.  Nonetheless, the food was tasty and filling.  The beef was good quality and the spicy sauce which accompanied it was delicious.  I'd certainly recommend ordering from So Good, just be prepared for a bit of a wait.
5	Chanced upon this place last night and am very pleased to have done so. My Thai spicy & sweet chilli chicken with boiled rice was fantastically tasty with very well proportioned pieces of chicken. Clearly cooked & not just nuked I'd happily get food from here again.
4	So Good is a sterling example of a Chinese takeaway, the satay skewers or ribs are great starters and the mains from Kung Po to Szechaun are enjoyable, good quality and a decent portion.What boosts So Good above the regular good Chinese though is the Thai specialities, I have worked my way through most of these and enjoyed them all. Thai food still isn't that common in Edinburgh, so being able to pop into a local takeaway on the way home is ideal.All in all then, So Good offers good Chinese and a small selection of Thai dishes making it an ideal takeaway.
4	This Chinese is our local take away. The food that I tend to get from the Chinese is excellent (chow meins, crisp shredded chicken/beef, fried rice, spring rolls). Knocked 1 star off due to the pictures on the menu not reflecting the dishes at all. A friend ordered the Pad Thai which came in a sweet and sour sauce (not listed or shown in the picture). I would recommended the deep fried shredded chicken!
