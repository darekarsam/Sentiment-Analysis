5	I love this makeup. Very high end for a good price. The lip sticks & gloss are amazing. The eye shadows are awesome & the packaging for everything is super cute. I  took a makeup class with rain about a week ago & it was so much fun! I learned all kinds of little tricks & tips. I highly recommend people to take the class! Oh & I love how they have cute names for all their products such as..  Center of attention, life of the party, VIP list, hot mess & tease
5	I love my rain products! The conceal reveal flawless foundation covers so well and doesn't feel heavy or greasy. It also stays on all day, especially when I use  the translucent loose setting powder over it! I also love my glowing blush! Strip tease isn't just the most amazing name ever it's also the perfect color! The products all look so chic in their design, I leave them out on the counter sometimes because I love the blue color :)  I highly recommend everyone tries Rain. They're not ridiculously expensive and they last a long time.
5	I love Rain Cosmetics! The classes are so much fun! The staff is amazing and the products are fantastic. The coverage of the foundation is spectacular. Eye shadows are nice and pigmented and the lipsticks and gloss are A+ This makeup is definitely worth adding to your kit!
