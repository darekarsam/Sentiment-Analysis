5	Thanks Chris for your excellent service. I really appreciate you coming over in such short notice too.
5	Seriously, Chris is a life (and nose) saver! He swooped in, cleaned up the ginormous amount of dog poop in my yard, and left without a trace! The rates are VERY reasonable and definitely worth it in terms of what service you get. I'd recommend Chris to anyone needing help simplifying life.
5	It doesn't get any better than this! He was polite, quick, efficient and came on short notice. The rates are extremely fair. The yard looks good and I'll be a continuing customer. Kudos Chris!
