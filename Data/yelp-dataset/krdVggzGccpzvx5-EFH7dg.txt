5	Fantastic, hidden gem of a boutique. Hidden in Boca Park off of Rampart (directly across from Kona Grill) this very small store has the hippest club clothes in Vegas, and the best prices. You can buy Salvage here for a lot less than the high-end places on the Strip. Perfect place for thin hotties who like to go out and party at the clubs, definitely not for larger girls or those who are shy about showing off their bodies - they obviously know their niche and sever it very well, without worrying about trying to be all things to all people.
5	Love the designer brands, low prices and nice people.  New styles every day. Awesome!
