5	Joe is the owner and repair person who comes out.  He came 20 minutes after I called and within 2 hours we had cold air flowing.  He is so nice, efficient and sold us just what we already suspected we needed.  Call him!  You won't be disappointed.  And the prices are way reasonable.  I can't recommend him highly enough if I could give 10 stars I would!
5	Joe was incredible! Our A/C unit quit in the middle of the night.  With a dog in the house and the temperature reaching 93 degrees, we couldn't wait until  morning to have it serviced so we called Control Air of Southern Nevada.  Joe came out at 3:30 in the morning with a smile on his face and got our unit back up and running.  He was a life saver and I would recommend his services to anyone.
5	Let me get right to the point. It was a hot summer night about 96 degrees. About 8pm my central air stops putting out cold air. I make about 6-8 phone calls to " 24/7" services, including all the "biggest" advertisers. I get one call back in the next half hour and its some guy named Joe (by the way, nobody else even returned my call until the next day) . He tells me he will be at my condo within 45 mins. He came out for a $29 diagnostic fee. If you chose to accept his service, he will apply that $29 to your bill. He had my air up and chilling in about 1.5 hours. He even gave me a 10% discount. The total was about $200. Joe, you were awesome. The only thing I am sorry about is I took this long to write a review. Thanx againA.J.
