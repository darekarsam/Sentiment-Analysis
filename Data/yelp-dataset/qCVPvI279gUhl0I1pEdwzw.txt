5	I went to Barbie's with family, and despite a nondescript appearance we had some great food. My smoked meat platter was a tremendous value. The smoked meat was as good as I can remember since Schwartz's, tender and moist and very tasty. The french fries were classic Quebec fries - very, very good. The before 4PM price was a bargain for such a large portion.Service was fine, and there's plenty of free parking.Barbie's is a hidden jewel. Highly recommended.
2	Was there with my family early supper before 4:30. I presented a coupon before the meal and from then it went downhill. 15 minutes for popcorn that we had to ask for. Once the food arrived the portions as always huge,monte Carlo potato was the only high point. My Caesar salad was bitter and the dressing was almost tasteless. Our waiter was not readily available despite the fact that it was quiet. Food was at best average. We had to get up and get ketchup from another table which had at most a squirt left in it,then we tried another table,waving down the waiter for a refill and the dessert that was included with the $6.99 kids meal ,icecream which tasted like it had freezer burn. When the bill arrived the coupon was not deducted and after we left we realized that we where charged $2.99 for a kids sized fountain 7up the same price that we paid for the adult size.2 meals, one fry (huge portion)one kids meal 2 soft drinks with$11.00 coupon still ran us $55.00 .
