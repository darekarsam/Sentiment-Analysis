4	Bacco has a great friendly feel to it and was set up by a man whose family has a vineyard in Italy. They are extremely knowledgeable about wine and are also keen to chat about wine, too! I first met these folks at a wine tasting and they (and their wines!) were fantastic so I visited their shop a few weeks ago to buy some Asti sparkling dessert wine which is amazing. I also discovered that they're branching out into Scottish craft beer now, so it was fun to browse their selection and pick up some new finds as well!
