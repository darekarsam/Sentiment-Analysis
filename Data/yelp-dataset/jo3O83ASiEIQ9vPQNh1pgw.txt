4	St. Cathrine had me majorly bummed out by the scene. Shopping trendy stores is not my deal. So I was really excited when I saw that familiar Lush sign. It means friendly, enthusiastic, knowledgeable staff, and wonderful smells!II bought a bath bomb to clear away the "hotel" smell of my room, and got some great samples.
4	I'm a big fan of Lush products, they really do their job and tickle the hipster in me who wants to save the planet but doesn't really connect with manifestations or World Vision commercials. I would recommend their face masks, their bath bombs and their tonics. Note that everything IS a bit pricy..No matter how lost or spotty I look I always feel welcomed. I think it's simply because they are located in a touristic area but the staff has always greeted me in French and English, a delicate touch. Generally they are mostly anglophones but make a valiant effort to serve in French be it your language of choice. The employees are generally rather chatty and providing you're a frequent customer, you can really bond with them.I feel their only flaw would be that they can be a little overzealous at times ("You would LOVE this, let's try it! No? Let's try the other one! Were you looking for this and that as well?") but a polite "Just browsing thank you" does the trick.The only little problem I have is with the space, it's so cramped, be careful not to back into a bowl of water or a carefully assembled soap display.
