2	They are very slow in the drive thru.
1	I hate this McDonald's. With all my life. Slowest service of all time and out of the 4 times I've been here, they made me wait/pull around because they couldn't get food out in a normal time. Worst ever.
1	Went to the drive through just for an ice cream cone and I was informed that they weren't selling ice cream. When we pulled up to wait for the car in front of us to get there order we saw the worker hand them an    Ice cream come..
1	Very dirty and fries were cold and don't get me started on the bathrooms.  I would drive a little further to a different location.
