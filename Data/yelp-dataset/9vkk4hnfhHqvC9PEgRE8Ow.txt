5	Fantastic array of old and new, unique and obscure items for the home...  great for off the wall and specialty gifts.  We'll be visiting often, have fun!
5	Came in during the art show and was blown away at the treasures I found. Items are always changing and nothing is ever two of a kind here. If you are looking for that special certain piece for your home that no one else will also have this is the place to go!
1	DO NOT SHOP HERE!I went in here on the evening of the Art Fest.  It was very crowded, as the space is small and it was a busy evening.  I saw a Felix reproduction clock on the wall and asked to purchase it.  To my surprise, they didn't take it off the wall, rather had some in boxes below the register.  When I got it home, I realized it was very poor quality.  Cheap plastic, not worth the $50.00 I paid for it.  A few days later, I went to return the clock and they informed me that they have a no return policy.  They said it was posted by the register.  I explained to the owner that it was extremely busy the evening I purchased it and did not see the return policy, nor did anyone inform me of it.  I asked him to make an exception this time and, at least, allow me to pick something else out as an exchange or to issue me store credit.  He refused to do so.  He was rude and unwilling to compromise.BUYER BEWARE!
