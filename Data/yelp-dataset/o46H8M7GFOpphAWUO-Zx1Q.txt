5	Awesome new management! I really enjoy coming here. The drinks & food specials are great. The service is quick & friendly. They just arranged for a DJ to come on weekends & pool tables to be available for customers. I can't wait to see what other new things they do.
3	The food here is average and reasonably priced. A neighborhood place that you could learn to frequent because convenience of location and quick food.
1	Food is awesome . Employees are amazing. But sometimes the seafood isn't always cooked, and the chicken sits out uncovered. Management is disrespectful which makes me think bad of the business. They have had a failed business in the past which speaks volumes.
1	The management here is absolutely terrible. We ordered a simple meal (chicken tenders and mozzarella sticks) which took close to two hours to recieve. When we asked to speak to a manager about the awful service, he snatched the plates from in front of us and said "you no pay, you no eat." There was clearly a communication issue, however as a manager that is unacceptable behavior. Take your business elsewhere. The food isn't that great anyway.
1	Have you recently had a colonoscopy? You will look back upon the experience with fondness after eating here.  No, seriously, have your interior probed before dining at this establishment. It's never a bad idea to get to know the doctor this undercooked food will be forcing you to visit.
