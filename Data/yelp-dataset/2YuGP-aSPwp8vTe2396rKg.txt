4	We have rented a property for two years under the managment of this company.  He has been responsive to all of our phone calls, emails and txt's.  We have had several issues in the two years on our rental property and he has responded to them all.  We have appreciated his managment of our lease and would recommend him to our friends.
5	Larry recently helped my wife and I find a home.  He was very professional, fast, and always made sure to go above and beyond during every step of the process.  He treated me as I wanted to be treated, I will be using him again soon.
4	After a horrible experience with another property management company, Lesser and Associates was able to help with damage control and is now managing the home I live in.  Like night and day.  Thanks Larry.
5	Larry Lesser is a great property manager! His professional service and expertise in the industry are unsurpassed. I have happily referred several clients to Larry and will continue to do so in the future. Larry is a shining star in the world of property management. Other property management companies could learn from his quality of service and knowledge.
