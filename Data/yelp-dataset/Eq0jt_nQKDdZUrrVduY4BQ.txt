5	Wow!  Incredible team of staff and doctors at this place.  Loved that they got me in on the same day I called.  It was great being able to see my doctor and then get right in for a chiropractic visit immediately after to work on my shoulder.  I actually felt better within minutes of my appointment being over.  Amazing team, amazing appointment.  I will definitely be going back.
3	I really liked the FNP I saw, but the Medical Assistant completely rubbed me the wrong way and tested my patience. We'll see if things improve--I have to return next week for follow-up.
5	Got neuropathy - numbness or tingling in your feet? Go to Arrowhead... great team. Dr. Ed Smith is very personable, knowlegeable, and explains things so you can understand. Dr. Biggs is the chiropractic guru and spends as much time as you need.  Kim, Phil and Shelby (sometimes) fill out the team with each bringing their own personality to the rehab floor. Emerald and Shelby are on the front desk and great one immediately upon entering the office. The key element is that all seem to love their jobs, have a good time with it, and impart this feeling to the patients. Arrowhead program managers handle the insurance aspects and do a wonderful job. All in all, a good experience and they are always on time... very little waiting!
5	My visit here was probably the best experience I have ever had in a medical office.  Everyone was very kind and efficient.  I was greeted so kindly and I spent no time in the waiting room.  After the nurse took my vitals, she showed me to a room.  Shortly after, the doctor arrived.  She was very thorough and wanted to make sure she had my medical history correct.  I felt like I was in very good hands when I visited this clinic.  It was just the right amount of time to spend in a doctor's office.  If you are looking for a great medical center, you might want to check this one out.
