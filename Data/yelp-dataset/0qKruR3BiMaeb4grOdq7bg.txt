3	This post office is pretty decent. I like how it is right across the street from UNLV and in between classes or work I can walk over and send what I need to send it good time. The lines may be long at times but the employees working are usually really fast. They are also very friendly. Coincidently, I ALWAYS get the same chick. I should know her name by now because I get her every single time. There can be up to three people working and I somehow get her. She is very friendly and lets me know if there is cheaper ways to send my stuff. They have lots of P.O. Boxes for those who need them and their lobby is open till 11pm. They are only open till 4:30 M-F and are closed all weekend, which kind of sucks, but it is a small location so it is understandable I guess. They probably only get people in their when school is in sessions, so maybe in the past the weekends were just too dead for them to stay open. I like it, its there, and it does the job!
5	Excellent customer service!!! I came in to apply for a passport 20 minutes early, & they helped me anyway! Super efficient, knowledgable, and friendly. Thank you!
2	easily the slowest post office I've ever been to in my life. don't go here if you're in a rush after 2:30. there's always only 1 person at the cashier while the lobby assistant starts small talk with everyone to pass time. express cutoff is 3:20 which is when everyone's on break apparently. the people are nice tho, just the systems flawed.
1	Every single time I come to this post office I'm inside for no shorter than a half hour. The SLOWEST post office around. Totally makes sense to have a line out the door, one person on the register and one employee greeting customers?? Avoid at all costs unless you have an hour to waste mailing one package. Side note: disgruntled customer came in yelling about how this was the second time his P.O. box was broken into and his mail stolen. This post office sucks.
