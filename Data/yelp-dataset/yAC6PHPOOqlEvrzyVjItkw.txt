2	This is one of the strangest restaurants ever. The entrance is an almost-hidden door at the corner of a block that leads you into a narrow, not-so-clean staircase down into the basement. You might mistaken buying lunch for buying some other questionable things, but rest assure you're going the right way. At the bottom of the stairs you'll see a door that only opens if you're still standing on the stairs because otherwise it will hit you. Okay, now you're in the restaurant. When you first walk in, you'll find a row of refrigerators with beverages like you would at a gas station convenient store. The difference is that the whole row is filled with beer, all kinds of beer. You can get 40s, 6-packs of domestic, imports, hard lemonades, etc. After describing all that, the weirdest part is... this is a fast-food Korean restaurant! You can get bulgogi, kalbi, duk in soup, kim chi, etc. Weird right? The food is decent and it's a great lunch spot in the heart of Oakland. If you haven't been here, just the experience is worth the trip!
3	Angela C. could not be more accurate.  I'm troubled to give it a 2 or 3, but I'll go with the 3, because its just so freakin cheap!  Weirdest place ever though, the randomly gigantic selection of alcohol, the underground entrance and the mere fact that its korean fast food.  The food is mostly ... not that great, except for the fried rice, which is beyond tasty!  And its like $3.75 or something ridiculous.  So you can get a soda and fried rice, which will more than fill you up, with just a $5 bill!  This place is fun though, check it out for sure.
3	My friends and I always used to get a kick out of going for ghetto Korean food as we called it... I loved the spicy fried noodles. I tend to like everything to be spicy but this stuff was to the level you could barely eat it! I dont know why but that made it all the more appealing to me. Yum, I do miss those noodles!
