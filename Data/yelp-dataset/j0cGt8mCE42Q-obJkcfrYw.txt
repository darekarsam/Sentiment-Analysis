5	Jeff Caler's office is easily the best insurance agency I have ever had.  The staff is super friendly & very helpful.  I was referred to them by my old agent in Ohio & they truly are great.  I have my car, home & life insurance with them.  You should call them too!
5	Great customer service, competitive rates, and I always get a call right back from Jeff! Nice to have an agent who actually cares about his customers. I would recommend giving him a call.
5	Jeff and his staff are great.. They really have a personal touch with their customers. The staff has been very responsive to any request I have ever made, and Jeff is a tremendous resource... not just for home/auto insurance, but also for financial services and advice. Jeff also has a great network of contractors/vendors he works with in the area, and he is always helpful with a referral. He has helped me with plumbers, A/C, contractors, etc..; he helped me get some dings removed from my car inexpensively without having to file a claim, he gave me good advice on buying a new car and financing it.Like A Good Neighbor... with Jeff it is not just a marketing slogan, it is the way he does business.
1	Jeff is not my agent, no will he ever be given the spam he's subjected us to over the 8 months since we moved here. There is a constant stream of junk mail (snail mail) arriving in our box and 3 phonecalls to his office have gotten assurances we'll be removed and them blaming it on "Head Office".The clincher came yesterday when 2 letters (identical in content) turned up in the box - one to my 95YO mother-in-law.SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, SPAM
