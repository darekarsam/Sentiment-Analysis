5	I brought my laptop in that had a virus that randomly shut down my computer and would restart randomly. I have to say that My experience here was the best of most places I've been to because Abi is willing to work with you and genuinely tell you what is really wrong and what he will do. That's something you can hardly find in electronic repair shop and without Abi I wouldn't have had good service and a fully restored laptop. Great place to go.
5	Abi fixed the water damaged screen on my laptop perfectly and in good time and for a very good price. When I went to pick up my laptop he also have me a $10 coupon for any other repairs I may need in the future. I won't go anywhere else for laptop repair, he's the best!
5	Abi was great in fixing my dropped computer.  2nd time he's repaired a computer for me.  Awesome service.
5	Well I needed a hardware fixed and no one would help me. Walk into this store and just out my faith in them. I'm about to head there now an get some more hardware soldered.
