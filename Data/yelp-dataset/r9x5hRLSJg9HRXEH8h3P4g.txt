4	Usually come here for waxing but decided to try them for nails.  Other salons have made me bleed but not Kat.  She did a great job and I was in and out in an hour with no appointment at noon on a Saturday.  They do a great job waxing to:)
5	I've been here a few times for pedicures. They always do a great job and I got a mani yesterday and I love it! Will recommend to anyone in this area.
3	From out of town and needed to get my nails done. Since not many people in this area used yelp to help me out with my decision I had to pick one closer to me. Called 20 min before just to check if spot was avail. They said yes. Went in the salon and right away I could tell it was very clean which I was happy about. Started a little late but was ok I was in no rush. 2 hours later I finally finished with just my full set. So if your in a rush I would not recommend. But other than that my nails came out ok but not something I'm ecstatic about.
