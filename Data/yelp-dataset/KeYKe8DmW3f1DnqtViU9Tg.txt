1	I felt strangely out of place by the staff. I was given dirty looks and my questions received no answers. However, I noticed others received preferential treatment. Why?I was the only Caucasian male in the store. Maybe I ventured into the wrong business? Bah! That's silly! People don't think that way anymore. Right?
2	I didn't get the same sort of treatment that Ben did, but the selection here is definitely slanted towards "ethnic" clothing. Lots more olives and oranges and browns (which doesn't work well with my own skin tone), but there were some white and black items that were just fine. Very large selection, all very neatly organized. Much better than the Ross next door and with a much larger section for men's clothing. Lots of suits and dress shirts in the back were quite reasonably priced.Sizes from small to much bigger than me, and that's saying something. Lots of buy two for the price of one deals.
4	Maybe I prefer my clothes a little more urban than the average white guy but, I liked this spot and love the idea of being able to look fly on a budget.Its HUGE!  Lots of variety.  Urban wear to suits and everything in between.  Accessories too.  My only complaint is that there wasn't much service outside of the fitting rooms.  But at these prices, that was expected.
1	Terrible Staff...Cashier chewed gum, talked on cell and asked that I excuse her behavior because it was close to closing.
