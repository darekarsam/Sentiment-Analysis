4	A co-worker had stopped by Shanghai and experienced the flower scented foot bath.  I had to try it.  So...my visit started with the foot bath....but while I was there....I had to try the massage special.  Goodness, I have never been stretched so well from head to toe.  After the 1 hour deep tissue, sports massage, the therapist convinced me that a swedish massage would help me relax more....and get a good night's rest.  Hey....with the special....I could not resist another hour.  So another therapist provided a soothing and relaxing swedish massage.  I am returning soon....for a Thai massage.  It is a very nice and clean location that is easily accessible.
3	I came here after work three times. The location is perfect. I loved Mary, but the third time, I had two different staff members. The massage had questionable draping practices and the girl who did my eyebrows burnt me with the wax and left blisters on my face. She also dropped wax in my hair and then she cut my hair with the eyebrow scissors and never asked me about it. Worst eyebrow wax experiencein my life..
5	I usually get a Swedish, Deep Tissue, or Thai massage and the Thai massage that I received here was a VERY quality one. No frills, Authentic, and not Pretentious.  All of my pressure points were found and handled very well.  Im coming back again for a facial and another body massage!!
4	Great place to get a real deep tissue back massage, they do a great job getting the knots out and helping relaxation. Wish they do more work on the arms and legs, but can't beat walking in and no appointment needed.
