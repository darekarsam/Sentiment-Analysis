4	I'm giving this branch four stars for a couple reasons. First its very close to my house. Second I'm on a first name basis with the clerks & a few of the supervisors so it has a homey feel to me. It can have very quick service or you can get a clerk that's so slow that you want to claw your eyes out with a fork. Sometimes though its the customers that make you wonder if maybe there's a full moon out there.The branch has mailbox services, 2 automated postal centers, a satellite counter that may or may not be open & a long main counter that can have up to three clerks.This branch also has a passport office but most folks never find out where it is until they've stood in line for half an hour.The passport office is located on the back side of the building. You have to drive around the right side of the building past Char 7 Bar till you come to a chain link fence. The office will be the door closest to the fence. It really helps speed up the passport process if you have the form already filled out. The clerk will walk you through every line on the form so be prepared to be there for awhile. There is often a line as well. The office also does not have the same hours as the branch it is attached to so you may need to ask a clerk before heading back.
3	A nice post office that sadly is not very close to my home. But that's not the fault of these folks, I'll have to complain to the USPS HQ.Friendly and efficient clerks who were able to get my package from the back very quickly and also sell me a few stamps. This is a full service post office, with mailboxes, an automated stamp machine and mailing supplies like boxes and packing materials.Decent sized parking lot. You'll know you're there by the American flag.
