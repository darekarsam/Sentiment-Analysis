4	Arco has the best prices back home (SoCal) and we noticed have the cheapest gas in Vegas as well. We paid $3.13 a gallon, about 20 cent cheaper than other gas stations in the area and at least 50 cent cheaper than at home, NICE!
1	Alright so just today, I got into some sort of incident over available gas pumps here. I was filling up on $60 of gas (prepaid) into my rental car before I was going to return it to the store, and this angry, bitchy grandma starts honking at me from behind. Annoyed by this, I decided to not bother driving my car away before I get my extra change back. And I shouldn't have to either, because she could have waited at ANY of the other 4+ pumps that are not out of order instead.You got the nerve to honk at me just to get your impatient ass (and probably procrastinating) to my pump when I am busy trying to fill up my gas tank to return it to the rental location. And then you expect me to move my car just to get a $1.40 in change because you are late? I don't have to listen to you for shit. Then she walks in and calls me a moron because I didn't feel the need to listen to her because of her rudeness. A yelling match broke out, I ended my tirade by telling her to "Go eat a dick!" and left.On my way out it seemed like the cashiers were taking HER SIDE, when I am the patient one and by all means, I am also the one maintaining a civil demeanor.I have your license plates, I have your make and model, and I know what you look like. I won't be buying gas from this shithole, but I will be waiting for you to come back. Since you have Nevada plates, likely you are a local, and possibly this specific Arco is one of your habitual stops, meaning either this station could be close to your job (if you have any, dumb tweaker bitch), or you live somewhere around this area.I will make passes by this location at odd hours of the day to find you.
