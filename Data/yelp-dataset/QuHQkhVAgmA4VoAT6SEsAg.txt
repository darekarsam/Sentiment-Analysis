5	Clear Pool has serviced our home for over a year now.  When we first moved into our home April 2013, they fixed some malfunctioning parts and turned a pool full of algae to sparking blue at a great price.  We initially maintained the pool ourselves, but eventually it became a tiresome chore, especially during monsoon season.  So, we turned to Clear Pool for weekly pool service and maintenance ever since.  They charge a very reasonable monthly fee through a convenient online invoice and provide quality results.  Our pool technician is trustworthy and always locks our gate when he leaves to keep our backyard secure.  We would recommend their service to anyone.
5	I have been using clear water for quite a few years. They are prompt and always professional. They stay on top of issues that arise with our pool and are easy to communicate with. I highly recommend them.

5	I used clear water service to get my cartridges cleaned. Marcel was great. He did a good job and also offered to shock my pool because he noticed that it was on the verge of turning green. Thanks guys!
5	Marcel has been maintaining my pool for several years now. Every time the pool turns green, thanks to the oleander and jacaranda trees that are constantly shedding leaves into the pool and the monsoon season, Marcel is on the spot to take care of it quickly. He also has installed a new pump and filter as well as gotten me a good deal on vacuums. Plus, he's a friendly guy to talk to. Recommended.
