3	This is a pretty average fish and chippy, with prices that are a little lower than you would find in restaurants in the city centre. The staff are all very friendly and the layout of the restaurant is looks modern and trendy.i ordered haddock and chips, and for me most chips don't really vary all that much from chippy to chippy, so the real indicator for how good they are going to be is the quality of the fish they have and how it tastes.At Tony's Fish and Chip Bar, the batter around the haddock was pretty greasy and soggy rather than crispy. The fish itself was very tasty. I did come here when it was pretty busy however so perhaps this had an impact.
5	Really nice food, fast service and staff are all friendly , very good hygiene too.It is open at lunch time and the prices are very reasonable and affordable, they charge less for school children wearing school uniform and they are very child friendly.
