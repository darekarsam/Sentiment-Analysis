4	I love Van Horne Pizzeria; every single time I've gone there or ordered from them, it has been nothing less that an awesome experience. The actual shop isn't anything fancy, but their pizza is fantastic. The workers there are always extremely friendly and helpful, as well as being both French and English speaking. Delivery is free, service is great. The pizza isn't the best I've had, but it is the best I've had in Montreal for the price! The only downside would be they're not open super late, so make sure to order before 10 or so.
4	This pizzeria has been a hidden gem in the neighborhood for ages now. The interior is unassuming and simple, but the food is top notch! Delicious pizza, surprising poutine. And.... Amazing steak submarine! Absolutely delicious with fried onions and other goods. What can't this pizzeria do?!Get the 14 inch steak sub! Great price too!
4	Every Monday I order a cheese pizza here and every Monday I come back. Laid back dudes that make good pizza. I think they are a cornerstone in my experience of living in Outramont and the best Pizzeria in the hood. Like Garfield I hate Mondays, and like Garfield, lasagna (in this case Van Horne Pizzeria pizza) makes it all better.
