4	They seem to have pretty much anything you would want. I don't have a military background, but the place seems complete. They can draft dog tags on the spot as well.
5	40% surplus, 30% cheap knock off Asian made, 30% American made cheapie.With that said, I'm sure this store must serve certain customer base.The guys working behind the counter seems knowledgeable. Also this place sells some multicm and a-tacs camo for airsoft kids. My cusotmer wanted American military surplus jacket to bring home, and I managed to find one that he wanted. Pricing is okay, compare to on-line shops this is about average. For surplus some items were cheap, some items were over priced.
5	Great staff! Fun stuff! Something new everyday. I highly recommend this place whether you need supplies for the military, love hunting, or need costumes for a play.
5	Great store! They have a huge selection of surplus items. They had exactly what I was looking for and it was made by a very high quality and well known manufacturer. Thanks for having exactly what I needed when I needed it!
5	If you need a bulletproof vest, they have them here.  They have BulletSafe vests which are really nice.  They are level IIIA and they cost only $299.  This is about half the price of a similar vest at a uniform supply store.
1	Allied surplus does not stand behind their product. I will not shop there again. If a product is defective it won't be replaced or offer any type of credit towards a new item. Lousy customer service
5	They carry the best selection of camo I have found bags tents survival gear if your military and in need of that emergency patch before inspection you can almost bet they will have it there for you great place highly recommend it before any outdoor adventure
