2	Went in to the store to have my phone repaired, due to the screen being cracked they stated I had to pay for a replacement which was $100( my deductible ) I say ok he processes the replacement but states I can't pay cash it must be credit or debit because it's processed by the insurance company. I stated I only had cash the rude sales agent tells me I need to go get a prepaid card... WTH who says that to a loyal customer I bet if I chose to upgrade he would have been happy to assist me.  Im so tired of receiving poor customer service from these Sprint Stores!!!
1	Horrible customer service. I walked in with four customers and two employees and it took 20 minutes for anyone to acknowledge me.
1	This a false representation This is not a sprint store on the door in small writing it says it is a wireless storeThey do sell for SprintThey tried to rip me off on the price of the phone by saying I had to make monthly paymentsThey would not let me pay for the phone up frontIf I would have paid it out a two hundred dollar phone would have been 600 Buyer beware and find a real sprint store the signs on the top say sprint but THEY R NOT SPRINT.
1	Rami and Christopher are absolutely terrible at customer service. Walked away with a phone that was being shipper to her. I would never come back to this place nor will I use sprint once the contract is done. Again, rami and Christopher who are the manager and assistant manager are absolutely the worst at customer service. Definitely going to file a complaint for this treatment.
