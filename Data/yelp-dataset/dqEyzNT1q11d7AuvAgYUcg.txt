5	Elegant and warm ambiance. Clean and well decorated. Staff are very friendly.If you want to celebrate a private party this would be the place. The prices are affordable,from the outside looking in you would say that it must be expensive to eat their  but there not really really expensive for their  prices for and for their plates. I would recommend my friends and family if they wanted a friendly warm environment with a touch of Latin dance music  on any night  to go here.Your parties are customizable as well so you can have any music or theme you wanted that is really having a choice. I love this place and highly recommend it.
