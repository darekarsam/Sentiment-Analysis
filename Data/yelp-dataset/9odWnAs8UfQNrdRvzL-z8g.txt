3	A really cute place that is really quite large!  There is a little section for truffles and chocolates, a little section for speciality baked goods and cakes, a little bread section, a little section for cheese, a little section for take home type foods - i.e., box of petite fours, macarons, pies, savoury type foods, and another little area with sandwiches/yogurt/ cafeteria type items.It is a nice place to grab a little treat if you are in the area.  There is a really beautiful park close by called Bois Franc.The shop is located right by a large complex of relatively upper middle class town homes.  So I expect a lot of their business comes from the neighbourhood.Prices are what you would expect - about $4-5 for a little tart.  I tried the pear and almond tart and it was not bad ... buttery and not too sweet but it didn't knock my socks off.Cute place :)
4	I never stayed long enough to devour my fruit cake,  I usually take it home and enjoy it with a warm coffee.  I only gave this location 4* because of its prices,  which are on the higher end.  5$ for a small fruit cake seems a bit expensive. Can't argue with taste though : delicious!
