4	I usually gas up at Chevron but since moving Smith's gas station is closer. We tested their gas vs Chevron's gas on a roadtrip to Cali. Made it to Cali w/o having to refuel and still had gas to drive around w/while there. And saving $ on gas because we're frequent Smith's shoppers is an added bonus!
4	Easy access to multiple pumps. Has some of the lowest fuel prices in the area. Gasoline octane available is 87, 89, and 91. Diesel fuel is availible as well.
5	Smiths fuel points make the price of gas tolerable. I have never had an issue with the quality of the gas here. Service is good.
1	I wouldn't recommend using Smith's Fuel. I've had two brand new vehicles develop fuel leaks after 35k miles. The only thing that remained consistent was the fact that I fueled up at Smith's 95% of the time as I was gaining fuel points by shopping there. Let me tell you, it's not worth the savings. You will pay more later due to the poor quality of fuel. If you notice, most gas stations serve Top Tier fuel, except for Smiths. Even Costco gas is rated as Top Tier. Sure you will save money at Smiths in the short run, but I believe the poor quality of their fuel will cost you more in the long run.
