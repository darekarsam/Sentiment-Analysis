5	Amazing!  For a gift I got a facial from Miss Elizabeth.  Completely took away my tension!  She spoiled me beyond belief!! My skin in hydrated and happy. Not expensive - affordable!  If you have the time - indulge.  She is a gift to the Skin World.Mrs.Gwen did my hair and i looks amazing!
5	I went to see Autumn for the first time last night for a full set of lashes - I found an incredible deal on www.therescuestore.com (the proceeds go to local care programs in the valley) so I gave it a try!  Autumn was friendly and inviting and I absolutely LOVE my lashes!   She really cared about my comfort and if I was happy with the results and took her time to make sure that I was completely satisfied.  I found out that she also does hair- so I am very excited to visit her for that as well.When I stepped into the salon, it was an absolute calming and beautiful paradise.  Everything was inviting and lovely, I felt welcomed right away- I found out that they also do Organic facials.. so this is another thing on my wish list!  Thanks to www.therescuestore.com for turning me onto the best kept secret that I am happy to share!
4	Melanie is by far the most knowledgeable and caring aesthetician I have ever met. By the end of my facial I felt like we were best friends. I was referred to her by my sister a month ago and since then I have already sent her two new clients. I can't stop raving about Melanie. She uses natural products/oils and offers a number of services. I highly suggest the Mico Current facial.
