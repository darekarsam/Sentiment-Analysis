1	I really like Arby's but I can't recommend this location.  Took the family for lunch this week and when we walked in we immediately lost our appetite.  The smell was so overpower of 'airport latrine' that we lost our appetites.  We moved from the front area to see if it was any better in the dining room and then we were confronted with crazy bad carpet smell.  I guess stick to the drive thru if you want to still have an appetite for Arby's at this location.
3	I like Arby's because they are different. Not your burger and fries fast food chain. My favorite is their chicken salad sandwich on wheat. This was an excellent sandwich. As you noticed I said WAS? They have now discontinued this sandwich. i have now noticed their menu is beginning to look like any other fast food chain. Arby's has chicken tenders, and it's not that good. They also now have jalapeno poppers, again not that good. They still have their roast beef selection and it's still and good alternate if your're tired of burgers. Now had a very decent experience at this location. Service was very fast, and courteous. Place was very clean. I hope Arby's isn't planning to go towards a menu like the other fast food chains. We already have them, be different and give us other options.
3	We have always had a decent meal at this location. Staff are pleasant, fast and outgoing. The restaurant could use some a remodel.
5	We love getting the family dinner. We get coupons in the mail for the family dinner! $15 bucks for aa bunch of food is what I'm talking about
