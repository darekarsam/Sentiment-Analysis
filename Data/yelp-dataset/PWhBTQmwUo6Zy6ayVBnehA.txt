4	My wife and I try every sauce we find and so far Sting N Linger is the best store salsa/sauce yet. You can find it at Fry's food stores. I discovered it was made just a mile from my house in Tempe. I went there and bought all their products. The habanero is what I like.
5	The real deal. Luckily they sell their salsa at AJs up by my house. It is the only salsa I have tried that is truly hot. Thank you for making such a great product. I have searched far and wide for you after trying the ghost pepper salsa at Canteen on Mill in Tempe.
