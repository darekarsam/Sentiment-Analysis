5	Cut and color with Jillian. She is amazing and I'll definitely go back. Don't get discouraged by the outside of the building. Her shop is absolutely gorgeous and she offers complimentary wine. It's all very classy. Highly recommend.
5	I won't let anyone else touch my hair but Jillian! She is the owner of the salon and is both talented, experienced, and always attentive to my wants and needs. Even going so far as to check up on me after appointments to make sure i'm always satisfied with my end result. Which I always am. Her salon is always clean, she uses quality products, and has created a fun, classy atmosphere that's great to be able to unwind and be pampered in. Would definitely recommend to anyone needing any type of service. Color, weaves, braids, cuts, nails, makeup, waxing, she does it all, and has 8yrs of experience so you can trust her capabilities.
5	The salon is beautifully decorated and complimentary wine is served. I went to go see Jillian after I couldn't stand to look at my hair anymore, it was damaged beyond repair. I was wrong! Jillian made me look beautiful again! Definitely recommend!
