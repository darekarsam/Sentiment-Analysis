5	The Best Breakfast and Lunch place in town.  Litle dinner but huge dishies..........    WOW!     Plus  Plus   Plus    Plus   Plus     No one will go away wanting to eat any time soon!
5	Excellent place!  Quiet...nice considering the raucousness of the strip!  Love all the service personnel, the guards, the other camping guests!  Very much a great place to stay when you visit Las Vegas.  If you are planning on visiting in an RV, check it out!
4	My husband and I stay here EVERY time we come to Las Vegas.  It's beautifully maintained in a gorgeous setting, and has 24 hour a day security.   The staff is very helpful and friendly, as are the permanent residents.  My one criticism is that their Internet connection is worse than terrible.  When you are here for business and need to stay in touch online, it's impossible.  We were able to connect once at molasses speed.  Having said that, we'll be back on our next trip.
