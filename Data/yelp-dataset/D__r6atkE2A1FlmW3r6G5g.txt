4	Went in for the first time about 3 weeks ago looking for a swing for my newborn. Just my luck I found a great swing and the best part besides the price ($20) - it was clean! When buying used, it's a shame that some people don't take the time to wipe down their stuff. Everything in the store was clean and in great condition! Now to the pricing - everything seemed to be about 50-90% off retail value which in my opinion, is a great deal. I googled the swing I bought and it was $45 new so I was super happy with my purchase. I also bought a bath sling that I saw at Babies R Us for $15 and I bought from here for only $6; again, in great condition!The owner was super nice and friendly and I will definitely be back to buy more items as I need them.
1	I have been to Stork Exchange a few times..I always bring in items to sell, always clean, always looking fairly newThe owner will give me $5 for something I paid $80 for!But that isn't even the worst thing!Today I brought in an item that was in brand new condition and she argued with me about the noise it made when it ran!Excuse me? I think I know how it sounds I used it for MY child and she did not use it for her kid!? I also think its interesting how no one is EVER in the store..probably because she charges $100 for a stroller its a RESALE store not a boutique in Scottsdale!I will not be returning and will not recommend the shop to anyone!I donated the item to the Crisis Pregnancy Center and highly recommend everyone else do the same!1818 E.

3	I came here simply out of curiosity.  Its a very small store but they had a good amount to clean, gently used stroller, swings, high chairs as well as kids toys but a terrible selection of clothes/shoe. I was actually very surprised at how old and dirty alot of the apparrel/shoes were! If you are looking for greatly priced gently used activities/gear this place may be for you but I wouldn't come here for clothes or shoes.
