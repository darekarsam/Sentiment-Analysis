4	Have only tried it once, but it's a keeper. My double (is it still a doubles if it's singular?) was very fresh and delicious, and the size was perfect for a light lunch, but it would work well as a snack too. Doubles are also super portable, which is a plus. I haven't had a roti yet, but it's definitely on my list. I just hope the menu expands in the future, because now I want more!Also, I have to (once again) applaud a food cart's customer service - I'm never disappointed in any of the people that run carts around the square. Bubbles was no exception. He initially thought I was a regular, and when I said no, he was super excited for my introduction to the world of doubles. He gave me a punch card (buy 5 doubles, get the 6th free) and even showed me the best way to eat it so it wouldn't fall apart on me! So awesome.

Studying abroad in Trinidad, i have a more varied judgement about real Trini food, and I know how hard it is to make doubles. I give Bubbles tons of credit because it's a true skill. However, I do have to say that I was expecting some more heat and spice to my doubles. But I think for most Madisonians, it's probably more than fine. I'm hoping bubbles prospers enough to add some more ingredients to his rotis also in the future. For all you who never lived there, this will be the closest you'll get to the paradise of East Indian food - definitely worth a try. You may see me there.
