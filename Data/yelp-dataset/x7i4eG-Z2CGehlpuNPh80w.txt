3	This is a great little market/store.  It's always clean, even luxurious feeling.  They cater, in my opinion, to more of a high end crowd.  The butcher is good, plenty of selection, but as an example, not where I would go to buy a pork shoulder, he's probably more than twice the price.I'm a fan, yet don't go often because of the prices.  I've debated whether to put the place at 3 or 4 stars.  My first thought is 4, but if I don't go unless I have to, I logically shouldn't rate them a 4.  Fortunately for me the location of the store is about the 4th place I would stop on my way home so it is usually the last place I look when I a seeking out something specific.If you're not on budget, go. It's.  Definitely the place to shop.
4	Where else in Monkland village can you find such enticing cuts of beef and a cheese counter that constantly exceeds expectations? No where, that's where!It's always a pleasure to rub elbows with the foodies of Le Quartier, it being a cozy little shop where bumping off your neighbours is a genteel game of excuse me's & pardonez moi svp.It's a touch spendy but here you get your monies worth, so save up and drop by when you want a bit of a treat.
4	I love going there when I want to host a nice dinner and serve some of the best angus steak we have in Montreal. I thing I love about this place is you can have sliced prime rib in the cold cut section to make awesome sandwiches on baguette for lunch.Highly recommend but of course more expensive them a grocery store but quality is there
