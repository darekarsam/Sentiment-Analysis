1	I will not come back here, ever. I got my manicure yesterday and it has already started peeling. It was nowhere near worth 30 dollars, and my nails weren't even manicured really--no cuticle trim or any of that. It wasn't relaxing, professional, or worth my money at all. There was no precision and I literally have to go somewhere else and pay them just to fix it. Definitely the worst experience I've had at a nail salon. Additionally, the nail techs were talking about their personal views on social issues, which I don't need to hear. They were ignorant and racist. Should be more careful who they say these things around.
5	I don't care what that other girl said this is my favorite place. American, so you know their not talking about you, lol and Linda always does an amazing job at my different requests. I come all the way from Payson (2 hours away) so you know it has to be good. (If your down to earth and not stuck up) lol!
1	Where do I start. This is the absolute worst place i've ever been to. I wouldnt go there if the services were free. When we walked in the place was so dirty and dusty. It was so hot in there. They had fans running to cool the place. We got the deluxe pedi's. The two girls doing the pedis didn't even know what they were doing. They kept asking Linda what to do. They didn't scrub or massage or clip our toe nails. Most places soak your feet first. This place didn't do that. Not a professional business at all. The women including the owner were wearing cutoff jeans folded up. I was suppose to get a full set after my pedi and i was smart to cancel that. Right after this horrible experience of a pedi I went to another nail salon and got my pedi redone. Please dont waste your money.
