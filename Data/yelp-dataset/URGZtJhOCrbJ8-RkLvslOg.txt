3	My goodness, that's a big burrito you serve! We stumbled across Firewaters Sunday afternoon when we were both very hungry. My big draw was the Coca-Cola awning because I was dying for a diet coke. We grabbed a table outside with a pretty good view of the baseball stadium and a fantastic view of all the scalpers. We ordered a medium burger that came out well and a veggie burrito which was eeee-normous. The fries were quite good and the burrito was pretty tasty. it's not for traditionalists, as the toritlla was more like a wrap, but I really liked it. They were generous with the beans and cheese. It's was cheap and fast, a pretty good deal.
