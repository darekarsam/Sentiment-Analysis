5	The massage I received here was top notch. I was little hesitant to even go in for a massage because I had only had maybe two massages ever. However, when I walked in and was welcomed by her warm smile and pleasant personality, I was immediately put at ease.  She took the time to get to know my areas of pain or ask me what sort of massage that I would like. When I explained I hadn't had very many at all she then took the time to explain them in detail. I must say that I am also very impressed with her online appointment set up. You can make an appointment online and are immediately sent an email to confirm your set appointment. If you need to cancel there's also a link for that.  The whole process exudes professionalism. The massage itself was so relaxing and alerted me to muscles that I didn't even know existed let alone were overworked. I am eagerly anticipating my return for a Thai massage to work my problem area, my hip. My first visit already alleviated a lot of the tension. In short, the experience is worth every penny.
5	After reading the previous reviews, I decided to try a massage with Beth. I found the reviews were "spot on" and I was quite pleased with the experience. The location is very accessible and parking is on street, however, free and close to the office.  Upon meeting Beth, I found her to be   friendly, professional, and informative.  She explained the technique, process, and the actual massage.  Beth wanted to be certain I was relaxed and aware while enjoying my massage.  The massage was wonderful! Beth did an excellent job.  I have had other massages and definitely recommend Beth.  The service she provides is worth more than what she charges! I'm just glad the price is so reasonable.  I will be returning in the near future (appointment booked before I left today).  If you are looking for a first rate therapeutic massage contact Beth.
