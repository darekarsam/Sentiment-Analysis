2	This Big Lots is kind of in a sketchy neighborhood it's kind of tucked away. Inside the store there were things everywhere and out of place. It was a mess trying to find what I was looking for. They were either doing inventory or restocking things but it was difficult to get through the aisles.
4	Each store slightly different with inventory, but basically they have the basics.  Some stores are more organized and well kept.  Some are dirty and merchandise are thrown everywhere. Overall this store is always kept clean and put up.  I have notice a few more employees around putting inventory on the shelves, and working to keep the store clutter free.Good place to pick up unexpected items, not sure what you'll find when you, I stumbled across a Waverly curtain that just happened to match my comforter I got at Tuesday Morning, go figure.Anyway, good store.
5	Great store, even better prices. I wouldn't recommend the electronics section, but everything else... YES. Especially the makeup; they have name brands at 1/4 the cost or less.
3	Mostly meltdown of garbage nobody wants to buy. Store is messy and unorganized. Employees are not sharp. This place compares to RAC rental crap and you know who those clients are...
4	I mainly go to Big Lots to buy make-up removal towelettes and to check out their seasonal Items. I like this particular location because the workers are always helpful & friendly.
