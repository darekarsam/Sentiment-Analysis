1	Twice now, I have scheduled ahead of time for them to pick me up. Twice now, I have had to call them back or call another cab company. Now I'm late. Maybe they are fine if you need a cab right then, but don't bother with them if you want to schedule ahead of time. Let's hope I don't miss my flight.

He didn't mind The car was clean , Tomas knew where he was going 2 and the ride was joyfullyWe are glad we used Charlotte taxi , a locally owned taxi service Thank you Tomas
