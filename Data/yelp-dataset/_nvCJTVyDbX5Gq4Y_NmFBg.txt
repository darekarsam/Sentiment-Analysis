2	Good stuff, poorly priced. If I wanted to pay as much as they have it listed as, I would buy new.
4	This store has a bunch of nice employees that are waiting to help their customers. The stuff they have here is also supreme. They have a mix of used and donated goods and even the donated junk is pretty good quality. I'll come back here if I ever pick up baking and need mixing bowls or something.
5	Cleanest, most organized Goodwill I've ever been to. The staff is very helpful and friendly and the manager is ALWAYS doing something. Every time I've been in here, he's in a good mood and so friendly. I find myself going to this goodwill more than any others just for the simple fact of the organization and service. Love this place!!! Always find great deals!!
4	I love this place you can get some great deals on slightly used items.  I have got a few steals.  The new stuff is about the same price of anywhere else but you pay no sale tax so it still comes out cheaper
