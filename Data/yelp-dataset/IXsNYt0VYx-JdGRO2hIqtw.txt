2	I lived here my freshman year, and it definitely wasn't my favorite.  The rooms are big, so at first Bromley felt like a good deal.However, I quickly learned that the walls are thin (probably just two sheets of drywall), and you can hear *every* sound from the room next door.  Even on weeknights, students often yelled and ran through the halls at 3 or 4 am.  As an engineer, I had 8:00 calculus most mornings.  So, I found it impossible to get much sleep, and I often found myself sleeping in friends' apartments, instead.If your goal is to party constantly, this is your dorm.  If you're interested in getting some sleep, Bromley Hall is not your best bet.
5	I lived at Bromley Hall my freshman and sophomore years. Made some great friends, many of which I still hangout with...I'm not sure where Chella G. was really staying, but the food at Bromley was (is?) much better than she describes. And, the cafeteria is open at least 3 hours for each meal (I just checked their website).Funny she also mentions the elevators. LOL! Those are some good stories :-)It sure was excellent to have weekly (or was it every other week?) maid service. The private bathrooms made the decision easy for me, did't have to share the shower with the entire floor!
