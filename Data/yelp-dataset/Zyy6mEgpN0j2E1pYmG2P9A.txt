5	Great coffee. Really good kolaches. Had a nice vibe inside. Nice, plush couches with outlets! I didn't stay but it seems like a good place to bring your laptop and drink coffee. Friendly cashier. Would return (if I lived here).
4	Everything is freshly baked the night before! Their coffee and tea is also delicious! Every time I've been here, the customer service is also outstanding. I'm greeted right when I walk through the door with friendly "hello"'s everytime! I will defiantly keep coming back. They have earned my business!!
5	The best cookie I've ever eaten in my life. Si warm muzzle, with melted chocolate! Looking at the tip of the basement of the house, you do not say anything. But the smell and queue at the door already realizes it must be good.after proving impossible to eat just one!
5	I went to this coffee shop today and got so impressed. I have never ever had such a great aromatic coffee years and years. Especially if you love black coffee, I DO RECOMMEND to come to this shop. You can't go back to major coffee shop anymore.I had cheese cake it was absolutely delicious. I was just so happy to find the coffee shop in San Tan Valley. I would love to come back 200% for sure!!
