4	Great little storage place. Awesome staff, clean units. We only had this unit for two months, but it served our purposes well. If we needed another unit, we would be sure to consider this one.
5	John (property manager) was great, efficient and professional. I was impressed with the cleanliness of this property, as well as this unit taking a cylindrical lock. I was more than satisfied with the price of my unit, especially because Gilbert is such an expensive city. I am Public Storages #1 customer, always have and always will be. I highly recommend PS over any company!
5	John the property manager is super nice. He was very helpful in answering questions I had the other day and he doesn't mind if I park my car there while I go for a ride on my motorcycle which I store there. Very friendly and the units are priced very decently for being in a more expensive town.
