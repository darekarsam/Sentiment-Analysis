2	I tried to get a home loan here and they never got back to me.  Anchor bank down the road was happy to help.  Disappointed that my home town bank didn't take me seriously.
5	I have never received better customer service from a bank than what I have received from Monona State Bank.  Every time I enter the branch, I am greetly warmly and welcomed as a member.  The tellers are genuinely happy to help me with any transaction.  I got to sit with the Branch Manager once and you can tell she has a passion for making customers happy.  I can see where the rest of the staff gets their passionate customer serivce from.  I feel like I am a valued member at my local bank.  It's the way all banks should be.  It's the kind of banking that makes a customer say WOW.
