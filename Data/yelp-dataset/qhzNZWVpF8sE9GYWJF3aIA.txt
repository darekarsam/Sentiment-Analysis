2	Cannot recycle alkaline batteries and offered to toss them in the garbage but folks, it is the 21st Century and batteries contain high levels of zinc and other metals toxic in high concentrations! It's the law in Europe to recycle these batteries --can't we do better?
2	Not much to go off for a quick battery run.. I needed two watch batteries and the attendant didn't know how find the model number on the battery. I had to guide him along.  Also, the prices are higher here.  Found the same watch batteries at lower from $3 less.
