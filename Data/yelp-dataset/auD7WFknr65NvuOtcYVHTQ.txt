1	WARNING - DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. They caused damage to my pool equipment, left w/o testing re-assembly, and allowed 100's of gallons of water to leak caused unkown amount of damage to my house foundation. Then came the bad part ..... they incorrectly diagnosted the real pool leak ... causing me to tear up my pool deck for no reason. When I complained, they came back out and found the real leak 20 ft away on a completely different line. Thier resonse to this great service  ... "sorry aobut your troubles". They have one good employee (Vince). The rest of the service guys are dangeroius .... I tired BBB and ROC but they operate w/o a contractor liscense under the handy man state law .... BE WARNED ... VERY WARNED
1	The amount quoted on the phone and the amount charged was hundreds different and they DID NOT find my leak after "promising to find the leak!" Nice guys but never found my problem. Invoice even stated "leak in irrigation main PVC pipes cannot be located." So what am I paying them for! I do not recommend this company.
1	VERY POOR COMMUNICATIONS.  Don't call back, canceled out the repair day, and yes, they have some questionable financial practices.  Sadly, their work was satisfactory.  It just isn't worth the struggle to get timely service from the Leak Squad.
