5	Every time I've grabbed Spanakopita from here it's been still-warm. That alone is remarkable and the flavour, size, and price of these hot flaky little bundles of joy puts them way over the top into heavenly. Too salty is the usual downfall of Greek savoury treats, because of all that cheese, but these are light and buttery and just perfect. The place is cute as a button too: highly recommended.
5	The kind and chatty staff at Melina's make you feel instantly welcome - and help you make some well-educated choices about which of their delicious phyllo treats you'll want to take home with you or eat on the spot. The Spanakopita is a personal favourite (and it's almost always fresh from the oven), but don't rule out the Melina's special sandwich or the delicious (and huge) greek salad. Top it all off with one of their many imported greek soft drinks or an espresso and you'll be all set to tackle your afternoon.
4	REALLY GOOD PASTRIES. This is a small, quaint shop selling a limited but very good selection of Phyllo-wrapped pastries. There are other offerings but every visit, for me, ends with my walking out of the place with several delicious pastries in my hand (I always pick-up / take-away). There's a small counter as well as outside bistro tables ... when weather permits.
5	Great Phyllo wrapped pastries.  Honestly never knew what phyllo was till I came here, but wow.. these were good.  My favorites were the Spanakopita (spinach and feta)  and Brougasta (custard sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon).  The owner is super chatty and cheerful.
