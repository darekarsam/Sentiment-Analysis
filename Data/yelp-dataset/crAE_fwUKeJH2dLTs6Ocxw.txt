3	This bar has great potential!!The only reason for the minus stars is because of their lack of some drinks and no beers on draught. The owner (l think) was very willing to purchase any new ingredients needed for future drinks currently unavailable. There are TONS of TVs to watch sports. It's clean, open, and fun. I will come back and hopefully have a 5* experience :)
4	This place has the potential to really KICK it up a notch. I'll HOLD judgement on the 5th star for now.  No draft beer which hurts the overall experience for me. Kinda feels like a touchdown without the EXTRA POINT.
4	Great sports bar. Lots of tv's, leather couches and nice bartenders! Nice selection of beers. Minus 1 star because there are no draft beers. We had a great time there on a Saturday afternoon. Great place to chill out with friends.
