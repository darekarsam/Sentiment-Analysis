4	Thus far, I've only been once - but I have to admit that the staff here is way friendlier than any other UPS Store or Fedex/Kinko's that I have ever been to.  I have no idea what causes it, but whatever the reason, they sure do seem to enjoy their job, and that means I'll be back to do my shipping from this location rather than any other.Even better is that it's the closest to our house.  Sweet.
5	My sister sent me my mom's china as a Christmas present.  She wrapped everything extremely well, but along the way a box must have been dropped because it was open when I received it and five plates were destroyed.I called the number that the staff at the Mint Hill UPS store had conveniently put on a sticker on the box and they walked me through what they needed to make a claim.  They didn't actually tell me all the photos that UPS needed (UPS corporate wrote me a day later), but they were very close.  The staff were very helpful even though I wasn't a great customer. I've had issues with insurance claims in the past, and I was taking this out on them.  But less than a week later I had word that my claim was approved!  It was very easy and everything worked out well.The damage definitely was not due to anything that the staff at this store did and they tried very hard to help me.  They were very patient while I went a little off my rocker (my mom's china is discontinued, so finding replacement dishes was a challenge).
