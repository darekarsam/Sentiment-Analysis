5	Medz is a modern young salon with style... without the high prices that you are usually paying for these type of places!The first of our family to try a cut here was my teenage son (15 years old) and he is the most difficult of our family (no salon ever has satisfied him before)... well, he just loved the place and his cut and has become a regular since then (5 times and counting).My wife and I have since followed and we are all very happy with ambiance, the service, the personnel and the results.Highly recommended for all!
