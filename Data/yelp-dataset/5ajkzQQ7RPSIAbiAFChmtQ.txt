5	So thankful for Lice Knowing You! We struggled with lice off and on for many months. After this last frustrating time, I called Lice Knowing You -- they got us in for an appointment on the same day and treated my daughter and myself. They told us what to do when we got home and made the whole process seem alot less stressful.So happy they're in the Valley. I hope to never see them again ;-) but if we do run into an issue again -- we will definitely use their services.
5	So glad we came to lice knowing you. We got our daughter treated and caught it before it spread to a bad infestation. Great friendly workers, and a wonderful experience for the icky situation. So glad we can be lice free thanks to lice knowing you. I would definitely recommend them.
5	Thank God for this place!
