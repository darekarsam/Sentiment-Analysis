5	Had an awesome paraffin wax pedicure today!  Ask for Robert...great foot massage.
5	Love it. Ive gone for yearsThe staff is generous and courteous and Robert is halarious. My daughter is welcomed with open arms instead of an eye roll. Excellent prices, service and relaxation.
2	The staff himself was very nice and funny. The quality of foot massage and paraffin wax was great.... But my paint job is horrid! I didn't realize it until I got home but I am in disbelief at how bad the paint is. Not sure if it was put on too thick or what but it is horrid. Also, my girl friend who went with me paid to get a paraffin wax and they forgot to do it.
5	We were traveling through Vegas on our road trip and stopped at the nearest salon for a quick pedi. The staff are so friendly and welcoming and did a great job on our feet! Highly recommended.
5	I love love this place very comfortable atmosphere friendly staff great prices I'm obsessed with their pedicure packages
5	Not only did the staff do a phenomenal job but they kept us entertained and laughing the whole time. In a sea of options for your salon needs this place is by far your best choice!
5	Awesome place! Very clean! I had a mani and pedi with a complimentary neck and shoulder rub! Unexpected but I loved it! Friendly and accommodating staff. We have been here 7 years and never have I received excellent service like this in Vegas before. I wish I came here sooner.
