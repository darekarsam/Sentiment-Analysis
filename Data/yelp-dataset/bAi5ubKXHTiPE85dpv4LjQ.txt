1	After watching a few good movies with some great friends we collectively decided for some additional fun in the great outdoors. And what a better way of doing so by playing mini-golf? Queue scary music and hit play. Set in a post apocalyptic 1965 throwback, the location was downright scary with all the accoutrements, sticky floors, repulsive bathrooms, and less than desirable attendants. Don't get me wrong even I can enjoy a good round of mini-golf but when you're concerned about catching some foreign pathogen from the varied golf shafts, I'm not exactly focused on my game. In the end, it was a good laugh, no harm done, even when my friend commented to one of the attendants on the quality of the facilities. She just gave him a defeated smile, waived, and bid us a dieu. Exactly, goodbye!
1	Save your money and go elsewhere. Bumper boats weren't working, balls kept getting stuck in batting cages with no help to be found, half the video games were broken and bathrooms were dirty.  I had to ask twice to get someone to come help us when the batting cages were broken and the manager seemed put out.  If this is what the new management is like, I would hate to have seen the crew they replaced!
4	Got a good deal on tokens today, and there are daily specials.  Friday during the day is a grea ttime to go!    Seems to be under new management, trying to offer some cool things for kids.  Halloween event coming up on Saturday, 10/29.
1	Close this place down - what a shame.
