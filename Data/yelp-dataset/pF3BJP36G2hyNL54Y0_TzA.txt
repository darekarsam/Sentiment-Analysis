3	The place itself is a little too small, and the chairs and tables are placed very closed to each other (perhaps too close, making movements almost impossible).I ordered the beef fried rice and my girlfriend had the general thai. I ordered mine extra spicy and oh boy those chilis were HOT. So hot that I can barely taste anything else (coming from a guy who feeds on spicy Sichuanese cuisine almost daily). I still managed to finish the plate but my suggestion is to never ask for extra spicy in this place because their peppers are much, much hotter than any other Thai Express.The rice I had was not properly separated, meaning that I had many "clots" of rice grains that were tasteless. In addition, the chicken from the general thai was over-fried, such that it was a bit too hard to bite.Final verdict: given it is fast-food place, it is really not that bad.
2	Thai Express is one of the places that I would not mind going when I need food quickly or when I simply do not want to cook for the night. I tried this one and ordered for a to-go. Now I do not plan to go back at all because of two reasons.First, it's dirty. The place is really dirty that I could see flies on limes (yes, they were sitting on them) and the ceiling.. It looked like they do not clean until the store closes. It was a bit.. disgusting.Second, it's salty. VERY salty. Food was very oily too. The to-go box looked like a garbage can after it dried... I actually couldn't finish eating because it was too salty. I had to drink at least 1L of water after to remove that salty feeling on my tongue...
