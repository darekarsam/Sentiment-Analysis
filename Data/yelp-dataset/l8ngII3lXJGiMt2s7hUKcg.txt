5	I wanted to do something memorable for my 40th birthday so I rounded up a couple friends and set the date with Desert Skydiving Center.  Four of the six of us had never jumped before, including myself - the experience was great!!  Very friendly and helpful staff.  There was a technical issue that prevented me from getting the video/still pic package but lucklily Mike (my tandem) had a camera that strapped to his hand so I still got a great shot of my experience.  Now my husband wants to try a jump and I think I will probably take the leap with him.  I would highly recommend Desert Skydiving Center - thanks, guys!!!
4	We bought the Groupon for a tandem jump to cross it off the list!  But we picked Desert Skydiving because its a small, laid-back drop zone.  We arrived when the place was just opening. Employees and jumpers were arriving, because everyone was so friendly it was hard to know who worked there and who didn't. Being a little nervous, this was a good thing. Lots of friendly people sharing there experiences put us at ease. Gary, the owner and videographer, gave us our training and showed us the multiple levels of safety that are included in their tandem equipment.  Next was the jump!  Because of how comfortable everyone made us feel falling out of a plane at 10,000+ feet seemed perfectly normal. The free fall was exhilarating, but at the same time peaceful!  Thanks Mark for the AMAZING first jump!Skydiving has been crossed off the list, but a static line jump has been added!
