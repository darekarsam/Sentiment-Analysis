5	Cody was forthright, to the point, efficient and didn't try to sell me something I didn't need.  Didn't beat around the bush with up selling but instead explained to me in a simple way all of my options and pricing.  I was relieved to finally understand what I needed for Medicare supplement plans and what it would cost me so there was no mystery to this new entity of Medicare, what it is and what it covers.  Thank you very much Cody!  Highly recommend Cody, part of AARP agents.
5	Cody has been my insurance agent for the past couple of years.  He is ALWAYS readily available whenever I had any questions or concerns.   When I first talked to Cody about my health insurance I never felt pressured to buy anything.   He simply gave me my options and quoted me a great rate for my insurance.   I would highly recommend.
