5	Honestly, I love america for businesses like this. These guys do a phenomenal job at what they do, just amazing. Service is quick, knowledgable and incredibly courteous. they know what they are doing. they are open saturdays. i drive out of my way to go there, and its just  a dry cleaner. also they do all the work on premises, which i think is a good thing.
5	I am really bad about getting spots on my clothes where taking my favorite Izod fleeces that my wife buys me to two of our neighborhood dry cleaners as well as a dry cleaner by my office they came back with the same spots.I checked Angie's List for the Charlotte dry cleaner with the most possitive reviews and American Dry Cleaners topped the list by far.I took two fleeces where I thought the spots will never come out and the friendly woman at the counter said we should have no problems with them...did not even have me put tape or anything on them.  She said if they come back needing attention still point them out and we will run them thru again.I picked them up and no traces of the spots that three other dry cleaners said could not be removed.I know who is going to get all of my future dry cleaning business.
5	Best dry cleaners in Charlotte!
1	Too expensive. Go to the clears in the wells fargo buiding uptown
5	If you need a wash dry and fold place head to Kim's on Monday. It's $1.00 per pound. Perfect for a busy family that can use some help. Drop off and pick up the same day. Love this place and highly recommend it.
