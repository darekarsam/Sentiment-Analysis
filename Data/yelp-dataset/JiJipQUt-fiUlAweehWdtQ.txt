5	This is an art co-op where local artists and craftspersons sell their wares. I just would like them to be recognized since all of the employees are volunteers. The items found are very eclectic. There are baby clothes that are knitted, paper dolls made in the likenesses of local celebs like Andy Warhol and Big Ben, jewelry, paintings, and loads else. A friend of mine takes photos and sells them here as postcards; she's the one who introduced me to Boutique 208. If you are an arthound or artist, I'd recommend stopping by. You'll find lots of stuff to buy or a venue in which to showcase or sell your wares. https://www.facebook.com/#!/Boutique208?fref=ts
