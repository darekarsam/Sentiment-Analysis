4	This is my favorite of all the Pamala's restaurants.  The wait is not as long on weekends as it typically is at the other locations.  The atmosphere is quirky because is located in an old-time Pharmacy.  As for the menu, I highly reccomend the The Big Lincoln, which has everything you could ever want for breakfst in one dish.
4	The food here is great! as is the service. The menu is a little different from the other Pamela's, but they still have the hotcakes and potatoes! So, delicious. My only complaint is that they don't take names for seating and it seemed like people were cutting the line. Now, I know it's not their fault that people suck, but the situation sucked :( Overall, the wait is never that long anyways.
5	Always great food the only  thing that sucks is the wait in line but it is so worth it no other place like it.
