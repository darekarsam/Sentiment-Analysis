4	Small shop facing the west side of Jean Talon market on pretty little Casgrain stacked with bags of homemade, traditional tortilla chips in many excellent flavours including black bean, lime, and jalapeno. You can taste them from the sample bags up front while you check out the display of different canned beans, hot peppers, jars of salsa, fresh tortillas, etc. (Do you need a giant can of green tomatillos? Probably.)Then head to the back to the fridge for oaxacan cheese (the magical cheese that makes mexican food taste authentic, even in mid-winter Quebec) and homemade salsa and guacamole. We like to get the spicy salsa then cut it with fresh veggies at home to make it last longer and burn fewer taste buds.
4	Found this little hole in the wall and read Risa's review so I thought I'd step in.  It had the heavy scent of fresh taco chips just being fried.  In the back I saw the deep fryer, what looked to be a burrito press and a friendly guy offering his homemade items.  I asked him if I could try some of his chips freshly fried.  He said sure and they tasted good!  So I purchased some chips and fresh salsa!  Will update a bit later on with the fresh salsa!  Update on the salsa: This salsa is amazing with a good amount of heat!  So fresh tasting and 100X better than the Doritos crappolla and anything else in a jar!  It makes me wonder why I ever eat salsa out of a glass jar???
