4	I walked past Narcissus Flowers the other day with G-Bot. I saw some gorgeous blooms and potted plants and pleaded with my to get him some. He didn't. That didn't stop me going back in for a look later on as this florists is absolutely beautiful!They have an excellent selection of bouquets, potted plants, hanging baskets and individual flowers. Whether you need a bunch of flowers for a gift or if you're looking for some beauties to brighten up your home then you won't be disappointed by the choice and colours on offer here at Narcissus. Absolutely beautiful!G-Bot, if you're reading this, I'll be waiting for my Narcissus bouquet any day now. Thanks.
