4	A nice little healthfood store that I frequent while in Montreal.  They have hard to find items, plenty of gluten free, a nice selection of fresh veggies and fruits.  No bulk foods though.  I wish that they had a bigger to go items, otherwise the items they do have I love.  I love the new happy planet soups they were carrying in April.  The service is in english and the staff is friendly.
5	The staff is super friendly and helpful. I've never been unable to find what I am looking for.
4	Wonderful take-out counter featuring a variety of healthy choices & flavours.  Everything fresh, and low in fats.Prices have increased 15-20 percent since being certified as organic.
5	Awesome variety and Fantastic and knowledgable staff !
3	This store has a moderately good selection and variety with friendly and knowledgable staff. the aisles are wide so it's easy to pass other ahoppers by and the products are neatly categorized and arranged. The prices though are still on the high side. Some heatlh food stores like HERBS AND NUTRITION offer low prices but not here. Still, you have to take into account the location; I'd say this is the best health food store in the west island of Montreal.
