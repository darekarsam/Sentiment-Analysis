3	Yikes... 100$ for a DEXA scan is $35 more than AZ Tech Radiology in Tempe charges.  My friend and I are on a special diet/nutrition program right now (MedShape Weight Loss Clinic) and are tracking our progress through DEXA scans but... I think we'll go elsewhere! Won't see ya here!
1	This place is horrible.  Unfortunately,  because of my insurance,  I had no options.  They called me yesterday and scheduled the appointment for today,  told me to come in at 1:30. I arrived at 1:20, checked-in and paid my co-pay.  At 2:45, I went up to the window to find out sky I hadn't been called back.  She tells me my appointment is on Monday.  Apparently they were going to just have me sit there all afternoon.  The office manager gives me a sob story about how the girl is new,  how they are short-staffed, etc. Yet throughout my 3 hours of storing here in pain with a hip fracture,  the staff is hanging around,  socializing,  laughing.  No sense of urgency,  no courtesy.  At this point I'm a bit terrified to have such an unprofessional company handle my MRI.Stay away!
