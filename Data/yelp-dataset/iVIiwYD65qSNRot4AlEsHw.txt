5	It's a nice small community bank with some pretty good services.  I like the small bank feel when you go in.
5	Great bank! Amazing customer service!! Today I got a text saying my debit card had been deactivated. I called and was told that it had NOT been deactivated. Furthermore, had there been a problem, they would have called personally. I thanked them and hung up. 10 minutes later, Cynthia called saying that she had discovered that there this a new phishing scam and to NOT respond to the text. She was so friendly that I asked a couple questions that I felt dumb asking but she assured me there were NO dumb questions. I had actually thought of closing the account because I never use it. NOW I have decided to use it. The customer service couldn't be better. Truly!
2	They lure you in with their higher checking interest rates and then they are very slow about posting your transactions and move the closing date for transactions so you lose out on the higher interest.  I had my qualifying transactions in but they were late in posting them, so I did not earn the higher interest.  Be very careful about getting all the transactions in very, very early or you will lose out big time.  Very deceiving.
