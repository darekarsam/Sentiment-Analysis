5	Integrity is the name of the game with this adoption agency.  If you are an expectant mother wanting the best for your unborn baby or a couple looking to adopt, I highly recommend this agency.
5	We have nothing but great experiences with BAF. We adopted internationally and did all of our immigration and Chinese paperwork through another agency. That agency closed its phoenix office and transferred our state-level file to Building Arizona Families.The BAF social worker who wrote our homestudy and did all of our post-placement visits was great, and seemed to truly care about her job and the children/families she works with. We completed our adoption nearly 3 years ago, and we still enjoy going to BAF's picnics at Encanto Park. We enjoy meeting the other adoptive parents - and our kids LOVE attending the events!!!!!!!
5	I had great experiences with BAF. We adopted internationally with them twice and I have a friend that did their domestic birth mom program. This is a group of people who really care about families and children. Very Ethical and understanding with the ups and downs that come along the way. The BAF social worker who wrote our homestudy and did all of our post-placement visits cared about our family
