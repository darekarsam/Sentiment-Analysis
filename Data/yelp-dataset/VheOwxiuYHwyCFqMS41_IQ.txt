5	Lyndee has been pet sitting for us for over 10 years.  She is the best!  Great service, excellent care for our 13 dogs and 1 cat, and prices that are more than fair.
5	Having moved to the area last year from the Eastern US, it's tough to find a place that will take care of three large dogs, especially in the West Valley. Fortunately, Lyndee provides in home care. We used her services last week to take care of our dogs while we were away. She's fantastic and our dogs loved her. Thank you.
5	Lyndee is so great!! She loves our dogs and takes such good care of the. I love that she is so knowledgeable about dogs too. I feel more comfortable leaving my babies with Lyndee .
