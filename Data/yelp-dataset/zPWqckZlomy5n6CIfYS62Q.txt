3	Not one of my regular stops for Pawn Shops, but when I'm in the area, I like to take a look at what they have.  Every once in a while I'll find something decent.  Last year I found a nice gold necklace.  A few years back, I found some used DVDs of 80's movies I picked up for a few bucks.You never know what you will find at these places.Return Factor - 20%
2	Very poor service at the jewelry counter...I stood there 5 minutes before the clerk "Sammy" even acknowledged my presents. He was walking around the store talking to co-workers. A simple "I'll be with you in a moment" would be a big plus! When he finally did come over to help me he wasn't very knowledgeable about his own merchandise. But he did have very fresh minty breath though...just saying.
3	The service has gotten better...
