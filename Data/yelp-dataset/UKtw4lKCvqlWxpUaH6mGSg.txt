5	I have Alison cut & color my hair.   She's been doing my hair for almost a year now & does an outstanding job!!!    Highly recommend!!!!
1	Oscar cut my hair tonight.  Oscar will never see my head again. So let's start at the beginning.  I asked for him to use a 2 1/2 and fade it up.  Nothing hard right?   Well he started with a 4. The buzzer he was using was ripping my hairs out not cutting them.  He washed my hair with cold water.  He missed a whole section on one side of my head. I look like I have afro puffs on both side of my head.  This is my first haircut in charlotte and I can honestly say I have never ever had a bad haircut compared to this.  My barber who I had to leave because he was losing eyesight did better than this.  Needless to say I'm going to have to buzz my head and I will never ever step foot in this place again.
1	I'm giving it one star because I'm forced to. I have never been in so much pain during a pedicure. At one point I had to look away because I was afraid my feet were bleeding. Moving on to the manicure, I've done better in the dark, with my eyes closed. After she finished painting my nails and the skin around it, she put me under a dryer causing them o bubble. I immediately came home and redid it myself.
