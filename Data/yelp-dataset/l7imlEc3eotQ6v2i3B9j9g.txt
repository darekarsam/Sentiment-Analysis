5	Good service!! My daughter ordered the wrong pizza. When I went to pick up the pizza they made the correct order in 10 min and they gave me both for price of the one.
2	Not a fan. As far as pizza goes there are a bunch of options in Verona, especially south side, and the pizza hut is mediocre and overpriced. It's not horrible, but I only order from here when I'm too drunk to care about quality.Everything you eat from here leaves a greasy film in your mouth. Like I said, when I do order from here it's because I don't care about the quality, I just want to eat.
1	I have ordered from here multiple times and the order is either late and cold or just not even ready for pick up when I show up. The first time they were running an hour behind which left my delivery at now 2 hrs....the manager said "I don't know what to tell you....its on its way" did not even offer a discount. If there were any other pizza joints around here I would choose them over this pizza hut! Service here is HORRIBLE!!
3	I want to start by saying the delivery girl was very nice and kind and very apologetic for being late.Now I don't understand why a pizza place located 1 mile away from where I live takes almost an hour to deliver pizza, although she was nice about being late she never gave me a reason. To top that off the pizza was semi cold and very very greasy and just didn't taste all that good, I would order from here only if other places.
