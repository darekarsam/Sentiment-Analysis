2	Good selection, modest prices, cashiers don't check $100 bills for counterfeit.
4	I'm not a big name brand person!  And I love affordable clothing!  I'd rather go on vacation in a tropical location, than spend alot of money on clothes and purses.  So they have very affordable clothes.  Jeans for $6.97.  I got a skirt for $4.50.Customer service, neither here nor there!  All I know is I like what I got.
5	Lots of brand names- almost famous, Derek heart, wallflower, Levi's, Lee Brand Jeans (most 6.97-9.97). Same brands you would find in a Dillard's and then some. Haven't checked men's or shoes, but I never leave empty handed and I love everything I get. Lots of sales, promos, and coupons. Set up like a Marshall's or TJ MAXX so make sure you have time to look through things. All in all, pretty wide selection of decent brands.
