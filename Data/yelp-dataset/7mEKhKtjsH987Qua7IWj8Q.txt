1	The evil stepchild of Cineplex that they can't manage to properly maintain. The ticket buying process is slow on popular days and you can miss your movie, simply because you can't buy your ticket in time. So you spend your money on gas to get here only to leave disappointed because you get to see nothing but a giant queue to buy tickets. Come 30 minutes ahead to deal with their ineptitude. Of course the line would be longer if it wasn't for all the people who leave early frustrated that they can't buy tickets. Of course the point of buying a mobile ticket is... mobility. You should be able to swiftly get in. You scan the code on my phone and I'm in. Of course, if you don't bother to equip your cinemas with the required equipment, you just waste all our time.
1	Thanks for greeting my son tonight and complimenting his choice in movie and his hat Mathieu. You've greeted us on multiple occasions and every time you give great customer service. Sorry I had to interrupt your conversation about which accent you think is hotter Darryl (supervisor on Aug 18th at 9pm) but when someone shows you their stained white sandals from the gobs of ketchup I walked through getting to my seat - I expect more than directions to the ladies room. Replace Darryl with Mathieu and this theatre may not get as many complaints as it does.........seriously - for just one week....see what happens.....
