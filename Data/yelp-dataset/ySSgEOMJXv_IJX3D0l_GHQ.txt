4	They have a decent selection of sheets, nothing overly extraordinary but the price makes up for it. So if you don't mind sleeping on super soft bamboo sheets in a really awful color for a great price, this place is for you.Also love all the small trinkets and accessories they sell there.
5	I went here out of curiosity after stopping by PetSmart next door & I was pretty amazed to see that it had a lot of home decor & a great selection of all things dog lovers (like myself) would buy. This is definitely a store to shop for gifts & I will shop here more often now that I've discovered it.
