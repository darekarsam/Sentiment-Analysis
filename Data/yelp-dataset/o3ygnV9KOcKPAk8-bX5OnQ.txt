1	Asked for a trim and got more than half my hair cut off. asked for the sides to be thinned out and got a fade. If you want a fade this is the pace to go. If you have long hair and you want a trim find another barber. Oh and if your barber and you cant understand each other due to a language issues find another barber.
1	Gerardo's Classic Barber Shop is the worst place to get a haircut in North Las Vegas. Their customer service is horrible and the salon is very very dirty. I asked for a medium fade (I am military) and was left with bald spots on the side, line in the back was not blended at all and the top was too short. Thank God hair grows back!
5	This place might not look to friendly when you walk in or know what they are even talking about but it doesn't matter cause they can cut hair. Especially if you are going to get a fade.
