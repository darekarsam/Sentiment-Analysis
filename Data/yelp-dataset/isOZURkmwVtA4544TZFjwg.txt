5	I haven't lived in Charlotte that long and I saw Nicks was also new so I decided to try it. Best decision I have made since I moved down here... As soon as me and my girlfriend  walked in we were greeted by 2 very nice young ladies who escorted us to our table. We were greeted by our server very quickly. The atmosphere was very inviting and pleasant. Me and my girlfriend decided to get the blue crab and artichoke casserole as an appetizer to share. The potato chips served with it were fantastic, I would definitely get it again. We then got our salads, I have never been a blue cheese fan but their wedge salad with blue cheese dressing was the perfect size and was amazing, words cant even describe how awesome it was! My girlfriend ordered the Salmon which she actually got to decide how it was prepared which was very nice. It was very fresh and flavorful! I ordered the filet mignon with a pimento cheese crust. BEST FILET I HAVE EVER HAD. The best part about our experience was that we had multiple servers ask us how we were doing, kind of like a team effort which was really nice. We usually don't get dessert but we decided to get the cheesecake with a raspberry sorbet topping, again words cant describe how great it was. My girlfriend ended up eating most of it! I would definitely recommend Nicks Steak and Taphouse and I will be going back as soon as I get the chance!
