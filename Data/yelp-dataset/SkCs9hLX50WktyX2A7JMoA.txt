3	I stayed here for 4 nights for a business trip.  The tripadvisor reviews were good and the rooms looked pretty nice online.  I got a queen size bed room that was decently sized.  The bathroom was fairly large with a shower over tub for 89 pounds a night.  The good:- The location of the hotel was excellent, it was in the city centre at the west end of george st, rose st., and princes st. (nice street in the New side of Edinburgh)- they have a bowl of fresh fruit in the lobby that you can just go in and get fruit every day- they also have a pretty nice bar downstairsThe bad:- They seem somewhat short on staff, and it takes a while to get a hold of the reception.  However, when you do get a hold of the reception, they are very helpful.- They do not have any kleenex/tissue in the room- The bed was somewhat uncomfortable- There was no clock in the roomOverall, I'd say the experience was okay at the Hudson.
2	Great LocationGreat Staff but the room was way too small and my room was located above there nightclub and it was really noisy
