3	The staff here finally looks like thry're having some fun.  I've had lackluster experiences at this location in the past. But today was just fine.  I think they finally remodeled too.  It looks really modern.
3	I actually didnt know there was a subway in Park Rd Shopping Center. I'm not a big subway fan but stopped by for breakfast one morning.  It was dead. I am surprised they can compete with the other breakfast and lunch places around. The breakfast flat bread was okay. Inline with everything Subway sells so the selling point of the breakfast was how low the calories were. They have several options for under 200 calories.  Im telling you the next time Im on the road and need something fast, Im going to stop by Subway and save the extra calories for lunch.
4	For a simple chain sandwich shop this business really shines. It's not gourmet, but the sandwich's are pretty good. Here's why I gave it four stars: 1) they taste good, 2) the prices are reasonable, 3) the work area is clean, 4) the sandwich's are made fast and 5) the employees are personable. Give it a try.
4	The kids behind the counter are always nice - they always laugh and joke and offer suggestions. The restaurant is clean, brightly lit, and like the rest of the shops at Park Road Shopping Center, deep as a bowling alley. I've never been to an overall nicer Subway, in several senses of the word. The only drawback is, well, it's a Subway, and the food is not gourmet. But, hey, it's good for a quick bite and not hard on the pocketbook.
