4	Great staff. Good products. Haven't been in one in a while. They were friendly but not overly up in your face. April, Michelle and Karen were great!
5	This store is always having some sort of sale.  You can also sign up for the newsletters online (they come to your email address) and receive additional discounts.  I love that they are always changing their fragrances for the season and bringing back old favorites.  You're greeted when you walk in and a sales associate will hand you a shopping bag if you need one.  You might be asked if you need help about four time before you can get half way through the store but I rather be asked than not asked at all.  The Northlake Mall location can get a little crowded but try come earlier during the week to try to avoid the mass crowd.Most of the time they have the sale if you buy 3 you get 3 free, and sometimes if you just buy 2 you'll get 3 free.  I also love that they have body butter in your favorite scents now.  It's much thicker than lotion and makes your skin feel really moisturized if you apply it right after you get out the shower (which can be hard from moisturizer with added fragrance).
