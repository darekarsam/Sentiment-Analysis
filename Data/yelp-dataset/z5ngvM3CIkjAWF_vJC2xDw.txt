5	I LOVE LOVE LOVE Pace Pro!  I emailed them initially to clean the carpet in my apartment due to my sweet dog, Lucie making a few mistakes.  It's hard for me to talk on the phone during the day due to my job and a lot of other places wanted me to call them back to set up an appointment for an estimate.  Pace Pro let me schedule my appointment via email and even with my crazy schedule they were able to fit me in super quickly. Kris was amazing and cleaned my carpet in just a few minutes, let me know what to expect in the days after the cleaning, and told me to contact him if the odor didn't come out all the way.  Once the carpet dried, it looked amazing but still had pet smells in it so Kris came back for round two of treatment for free!  My carpet now looks and smells amazing which makes me feel SO much better.  Thanks so much for doing such a great job Kris!!!
5	The people at Pace Pro were able to fit me in within a day.  The gentlemen who came to my home were friendly, informative and took care of my home as if it were their own.  They are a class above other carpet cleaners we have used.   I would highly recommend!
5	Just had our carpets cleaned today it looks amazing, they did a great job! Also the specials that are going on right now are prices you cannot say no to.
5	Pacepro is very professional and knows how to get a job done. Chris and Alex were extremely helpful and were able to make our gross apartment carpets smell fresh again. They even left a fan at our house to help it dry out (when it didn't dry in the time they thought it would). And came again to do another deodorization (on the house) when the first round didn't completely work. I would highly recommend this company! They really care about their customers and doing a good job.
