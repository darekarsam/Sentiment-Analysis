5	It was great, good and fast service, the prices were right and the poutine was good. Hamburger was small, but heavy and the pogo was served with a curried ketchup, mmmm mmmm good!!!
3	little italy was sorely missing a poutine restaurant but i don't think this is the one they were looking for.interesting place with plenty of seats and a babyfoot table tucked away at the back of the restaurant. service is prompt. not much wait unless you're ordering a lot.many choices of poutine to be had, sandwiches/burgers as well as beers and the likes. fair price for the neighborhood.for the poutine, i got the regular vanilla one because that's how you are supposed to judge a good poutine right? gravy was good, nothing overpowering or cloying. cheese curds were fresh with enough bite to them. the fries on the other hand were slightly burnt and too crispy. if the fries were chubbier, the burnt flavor would be ok (you'd still be able to taste the potato and the subtle sweetness to it when it gets fry) but since they are on the thin side, all i could taste was burn. it takes away from the whole poutine experience.the homemade corn dog was better though and with the curry ketchup (which i believe is the bottle ketchup with curry powder variety) went nicely together. kinda like a cold cut sandwich with lays chips. you know, so happy together.if, like me, you care about good fries, i'd pass on the poutine (fries and fries with sauce) and just stick with the rest of their menu especially the corn dog
4	poutins are good, especially the butter chicken poutin. the fried pickles on the other hand are to die for! make sure you try them! good spot, service is a bit slow, but overall good food. i've been back a few times already, and it never disappoints.
4	Very good poutine. They have many different choices of poutine to choose from and they make the food very quickly
5	My favorite poutine place in the city. Great, interesting menu. Good service, good beer. Lots of fun people watching too!
