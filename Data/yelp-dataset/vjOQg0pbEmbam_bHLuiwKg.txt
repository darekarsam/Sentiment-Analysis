1	Terrible and Horrible customer service! I was so disappointed in this store. I went in very excited to buy some gifts, and ended up buying a gift for myself - which is rare. When i got home I found out that my daughter had bought me the same gift for Christmas, so i went back to the store three days later with receipt in-hand to return. The clerk accused me of scratching the watch and tried to belittle me in front of the other customers - I was disgusted by his treatment. I have been a loyal MK customer for years - When i called the 800 number they could not believe the treatment that I received and logged it down as a formal complaint - I will never go back to that store.
