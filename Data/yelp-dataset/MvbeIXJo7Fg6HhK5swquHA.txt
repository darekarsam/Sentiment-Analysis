5	Dr Whelan is the best!
5	Wonderful dentist! Gives out his cell in case you need anything. Spends time with each patient and is truly concerned about all the kids that go there. We went there for an emergency tooth problem when our regular dentist couldn't get us in and loved them so much we switched to them.
5	Dr. Whelan is an excellent pediatric dentist.  He truly cares about his patients and his work is top-notch.  A+!
