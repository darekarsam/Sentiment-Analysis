2	Well, we needed lunch what can I say?  It's an Arby's so most people do not admit to eating here anyways.  This location has all the things you would expect from an Arby's in Sun City West.  Old people, annoyed employee's, and a loud bell to ring on the way out if you felt your service was great.  Cmon, it's an Arby's.  Lost the bell.The roast beef is borderline food product.  Use this as a last resort.

4	Thanks Arby's, You made a mistake with my order then when you found out that it was wrong you made it right by replacing the entire order the next day without being asked. The food is great and the kitchen is clean
