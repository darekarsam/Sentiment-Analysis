5	This place is great!  I bring my son here when I get my haircut and it's a much better experience for him then the little kid places.  The barbers are fun, place is clean and my son LOVES the Hot towel and Massage at the end.  Very clean inside, Modern look with all the comforts of the old school barbershop!  It's worth it to take a the trip in to get spoiled once in a while!  A great place for the area!
5	Great job. Hubby loved the hot towel and straight razor shave in the back....this is our new spot :)
5	I am a typical guy and from time to time I mess up my beard when I shave. I stopped in to see if they could clean-up my mess and they sure did. Russell exceeded my expectations. He did such an amazing job that I'm thinking about getting my hair cut by him next time. I have been going to the same barber shop for 5 years and the service that I received made me consider stopping in for a haircut. I will update this post when I do.
5	Great service! I highly recommend this place. Juan cut my hair better than anyone I've ever had do it. I will be back!
5	Came here on a friends recommendation and loved it! Juan cut my hair and it couldn't look better! I will definitely be coming back!
