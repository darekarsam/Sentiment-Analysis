5	Very nice stuff, Mathieu is just amazing . You have to try Salon Panach
5	[THE PLACE]: Le Salon Panache?...a great atmosphere where you'll meet an extremely polite team of dynamic individuals who offer excellent service.  Who cuts & styles my hair? [THE ARTIST]: Sandy Hogue is a hair stylist with a passion (& gift) for sculpting hair into stunning works of art. She is a true artist. [THE BONUS]: Searching for parking is a personal pet peeve of mine---fortunately it's never been an issue here as there's always plenty of available spaces on the street right in front of the salon. Anything else? [THE HONORABLE MENTION]: The modern interior of Panache is lined with humble plywood boards that make the environment look sophisticated, attractive, & decorative. The massive industrial lights & large windows illuminate the salon even on the gloomiest of winter days.
