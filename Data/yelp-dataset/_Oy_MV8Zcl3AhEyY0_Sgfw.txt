4	For the price ($11) you can't beat it: King's is a straight up, old-school barber shop, complete with signs about goin' fishing and a barber pole out front. These guys have been cutting hair while watching Gunsmoke on the TV for a really long time.: Morrie cut hair for years for airmen back in the day at Rantoul's Air Force base. Conversation is the weather and Illinois sports and things are real laid back.  Nothing real fancy here: there will be hair on the floor and nobody offers you sell you hair product after you're done.  But they will use that warm shaving foam and do a straight-edge razor shave around your neckline and sideburns. Try finding that at the mall.
5	The exterior looks like it has been closed for over 20 years, but boy is it kicking inside. I rarely leave a barbershop liking my recent haircut, I can't even remember the last time I was genuinely happy with a haircut.This place changed everything. This guy is awesome, he's been cutting hair for over 50 years, so he knows exactly what he's doing. I won't go anywhere as long as I'm in the Champaign-Urbana area. $12 for a perfect haircut, what could be better? Don't be scared away by the dingy exterior.
5	This is a great barber shop. The guys here are consistent and know what they're doing, I've been going here since '012 and every time I walk in, I'm confident that I'll walk out with a good haircut.Plus, you can usually walk in on some interesting stories from back in the day and learn something new!
5	Have come here a few times now and am pretty sure I've found my go-to haircut place in Champaign-Urbana. Laid back, small, and simple place. TV is always on to local channels that play reruns of old shows like Matlock. There are 4 or 5 older men that cut hair (1 or 2 are there at a time -- so sometimes there's a bit of a wait), and I've been happy with my haircut from each of them. Haircuts are $12, cash only.
