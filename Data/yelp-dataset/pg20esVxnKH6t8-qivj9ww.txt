1	Yelp really needs to give people the option to leave NO stars. Absolutely terrible experience at this bank. Opened a wells fargo account two months ago, one of the questions my fiance and I asked was about their over draft protection. We were explicitly told by the banker who helped us (her name is Eva Meneses) that if for any reason our rent was due and the money was not yet in our account, that wells fargo would cover us, charge us a $35 fee and that would be that. We found out recently that not only was overdraft protection activated on our account, the type of account we have would not even allow us to have over draft protection. We called the 24/7 number to see what was happening originally because it was past the business hours of our local branch and they again told us that our overdraft protection was there. When we confronted the branch manager (Bronson Manivong) where we opened the account he then told us that our account would not qualify for overdraft protection. I called the number back again to put in a complaint with them about how we have been lied to by the customer service number and the branch and they then told me that even if we would qualify for overdraft protection it is at Wells Fargo's discretion if they cover the charge or reject it. I have never been ran around in more circles, or lied to so much by a company in my life. After two months my fiance and I are officially going to close our accounts and find a bank somewhere else to handle our money because neither of us wants our hard earned money in the hands of people who have done nothing but lie to us from the moment we opened our account.
