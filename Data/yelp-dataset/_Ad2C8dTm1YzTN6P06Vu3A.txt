5	I've tried 2 other French schools previous to this and got frustrated, for various reasons, and was not learning at the speed in which I thought I should.  This school, specifically focuses on each student's needs and area's for improvement.  The group classes are no larger than 4 students per class, sometimes smaller.  They keep great notes and are able to continue working on what you specifically need in order to progress.  They are very flexible with schedules as well, which is exactly what I need as mine is very busy and often different weekly.  After 3 Months, I notice significant improvement.  It is a welcoming community environment as well where they show interest in you personally.  The instructors rotate so you get many different ones teaching you which is great to build on.
5	A school that takes your needs serious. The teachers have their own ways of teaching the students, so you will learn a language in different ways in the classrooms. Also, I get a lot out of my private lessons.
5	CLC is totally different from other traditional schools! Especially the classes' size was perfect for me to study. I could get immediate feedbacks from the teachers. It helped me find out my weakness and work on it by myself. While I studied in CLC, I learned a lot other than just languages, such as culture, relationship, life etc etc. I will never forget every and each moment I have shared in CLC. It was like a real family. If you would like to study in this kind of environment, I recommend CLC Montreal. :-)
