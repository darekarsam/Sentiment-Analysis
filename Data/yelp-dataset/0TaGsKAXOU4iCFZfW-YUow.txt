5	Manuel Reyes of Just Right Masonry is our go-to guy for our masonry jobs.  He built a block wall around the perimeter of our house and did some repair work to the exterior walls of our block house.  We're in the midst of a major remodel, and have dealt with a wide variety of contractors.  Manny is always the best:  reliable, on time, on budget, and does incredible work.   If you need block, brick, or decorative stone work done, it doesn't get any better than Just Right Masonry.
5	Manuel removed a water feature from our back yard.  His work exceeded our expectations.  He is very polite, always on time, and on budget.  We look forward to working with Just Right Masonry on future projects.
5	I had two partitions of my backyard block wall knocked down by a tree falling over it during a storm. Just Right Masonry gave me a good estimate and I went with them. The block-wall repair looks seamless and solid. What more can you expect? Some big name masonry companies quoted me for twice as much.
5	We hired Manuel Reyes of Just Right Masonry bc of his excellent reviews on Yelp & he didn't disappoint. Manny did a courtyard block wall for us & was very professional & over delivered on his commitments!! We will continue to use him for our contractor work bc he's so great!! Highly recommend!!
