5	Coral hunters was very helpful and they have a good selection. I have bought several fish from them and they all survived. Pono and Matt were very helpful and knowledgable. I would recommend this shop to anyone looking for healthy fish and low prices. Thank you for your excellent customer service!!
5	Great service!  Can't wait to go back.  It's hard to find a LFS that you can trust,  but this one you sure can!  Thanks,  and good job.
5	One of the best costumer services I have ever encounter. Working in the costumer service field for many years I completely understand hospitality and people skills. These guys on the other hand just had it completely natural. Treating every guest as if they are family. Being honest with you and very straight forward. These guys know just how to run a business. I went in not knowing to much about what kind of fish I could have in a reef tank and they taught me so much over the course of about an hour. I was able to ask as many questions as I wanted with out feeling as though I was bothering. Not to mention if they didn't have a fish I was looking for or coral they were willing to go the extra mile to get it on for me. The prices were great I couldn't ask for a better deal all there fish were extremely heathy. I have no complaints if I could offer these guys more stars I would. I will be returning for more purchases!
