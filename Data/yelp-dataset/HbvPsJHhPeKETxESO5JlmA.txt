4	I was looking for a cheap place to stay in Montreal and did a lot of reading and decided on this place and it wasn't bad at all. Now I'm not looking for much. Sometimes reviewers are all complaining that budget lodging wasn't fancy enough for their high maintenance needs - and the problem often lies with the reviewer in that case. Me - pretty much all I want is a good nights sleep on a decent bed with clean sheets, internet, a shower and a lock on the door. Montreal is very old and very French Canadian obviously and this place is in a cute old building in a great part of town. It's super easy to walk to the subway or walk to the Quartier Latine which is a great street riddled with shops and restaurants. I walked to Old Town, le village gai, I got just about everyone from here without a problem - there's so much to see in Montreal and it's best seen on foot. And if you are walking around you'll probably see, as I did several times, people hoisting sofas and chairs and things on ropes from the front porch to a higher window to move them in because the doors and halls simply aren't wide enough for them. Montreal is charming because it is so old, but with that comes small old world standards for living. So yes, my room was small, the bathroom small, but that my friends is Montreal - it's not anybody being cheap. If you want a spacious place in Montreal you're going to pay well for it. I'd rather save my money for eating really well and shopping.Everyone who works here couldn't have been more helpful really. If you're not looking for glamour and want a cheap place to stay in Montreal where you can get a decent no frills night's sleep, this is the spot.

The bathrooms are tiny and nothing spectacular (this isn't the Hilton people!), but for $80 on a Saturday night I couldn't complain. The hotel staff was incredibly nice and he might have saved us a great deal of heartache. When we checked in he said it was "extremely important" that we didn't leave anything valuable in plain view in our car. A little later, we realized we forgot a phone in the car and when we want back to get it cops were everywhere and a man had been arrested literally in front of our vehicle after breaking into a car two vehicles behind ours! It was crazy and I can't help but wonder if our car was next. I mean this was right on Sherbrooke, but apparently Montreal's had a problem with car break-ins for a while now. Despite this, I still recommend this hotel. There are a ton of small hotels in this area, but I was grateful for ours. It was pretty and the beds were clean and comfy. It's also quite close to the metro with many restaurants nearby and it's only a short distance from Parc.
1	The worst experience I ever had while traveling! 1st they never tell you their parking is 1st come, 1st serve, on the streets during certain hours only. Then they put me on the 5th floor where they said it would take some time for the shower water to get hot. they lied! It never got hot! So they put me in another room where there was zero, did I say zero water pressure, which was very difficult for me since I have long hair. Also the water barely got luke warm at best. THEN!!! I tried to position the shower head & it fell off in my hand! Also the batteries in the tv remote died so I brought it to the front deask & they said they would take care of it. When I got back to the hotel, not only did they return it already to my room while I was out, they shut off my ac as well....which sucked since it was close to 90 degrees on that day. When I checked out they tried to bill me for 2 phone calls I tod them I was going to make upon check in & no one ever told me there was a charge for that. Well at tha point I just started getting bitchy & they didn't want to hear me anymore so they said they wouldn't charge me after all.Maybe others had a decent stay here...I really should have left immediatly,,,but i would just suggest you stay off the 5th floor b/c the clerk told me the water pressure problem is bacause the water is coming from the pipes in the basement... WTF??? (Lol!)
1	Disgusting and Dirty           RUNEverything is dated, everything is filthy, Dirty mattress and box spring, Unsafe and illegal windows. Cigarette burns everywhere, dirty tub, dirty thin "beach" towels, dirty carpet with holes, wall with holes, dirty phone.  Dope heads, drug deals, marijuana smell, heroin addicts all over the hotel asking you for money. Unsafe lock. You name it they have it.It was the only room in town. I got in at 11 And ran out at 3am. Lost money but my life was in danger. It's that bad. I stayed in "cheap" hotel before but that one gets a five stars for craziness. The owner is so used to this madness that it's the norm for him.Your room literally shakes every time someone goes up the stairs. Screaming at all time in the hall, shower curtain was used in place of window curtains, the shower was gross. The electrical panel in the bathroom had been painted over! The trash can is a grease bucket. You hear all the sounds coming from the room next yours and the room above you. Not to mention the fact that the bathroom was so small you couldn't even shut the door when sitting on the toilet! See pics.   This building is an accident waiting to happen.  Cheap owners.  Health department should be called.   Oh... Wifi works fine and Kat at the front desk was nice.
