4	The food is always pretty good. They also serve a little  cup of clam soup at the beginning of your meal...reminds me of a manhattan clam chowder.  This place is super popular and they also serve mini bud lights for $1  ( sidenote: I had never seen those minis unless I was with my Mexican friends). It can get a little loud and it appears that they only hire "sexy" waitresses.  It definitely feels like a little place in Baja
4	The food is awesome. The waitresses are relatively friendly. The only thing keeping me from giving this place a 5 star rating is the super loud music, I understand it's live but should it really be so loud that I can't hear the person next to me yell? I guess some people enjoy that. But overall, AWESOME!
4	Really good food and yes- really pretty waitresses!Invited here by a contractor after completing a job- probably not a lot of gringo's like me going through the doors, but I found out I was missing out.  Like this place a lot, the hustle, the volume, total atmosphere- very friendly.  Never once felt out of place.Had a shrimp tostada that was very "cool" on a warm day- refreshing. Could eat that starter clam soup all day long though!  Also had my first Michelada- think I might be hooked on that!  Great with Pacifico.Place reminds me a lot of my younger years in El Paso.  Too bad the staff had to put up with my seriously lacking Spanish- but they weren't too hard on me.  Definitely want to go back again for some fresh mariscos dishes- maybe help some friends discover this place too, who may not otherwise venture in.  Try it for some really fresh sea food, Mexican style.  Close your eyes and imagine the beach right outside.  That's the feel.
5	Our waitress was very friendly and frequently checked up on us to make sure nothing was missing the food was great and the live music really put on a great vibe love it here !! I
