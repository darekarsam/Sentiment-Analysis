4	This is a great NY style pizza. Great flavors with a very thin crust. I would recommend checking them out.These folks appeared at Triple C Brewery. Nothing better than having a pie and a great beer all in one place.
5	I can't imagine getting any better pizza from a truck.  The crust was thin and crispy, but with a perfect amount of chew. Despite asking for light cheese, it still seemed a bit heavy to me, but overall I can't complain. Excellent food truck pizza.The salad contained a very hearty portion of lettuce and vegetables, and was worth every penny.
