5	I have seen these children really grow in their learning, their social abilities and adeptness, their verbal and physical skills, and their spiritual lives (yes, children have spiritual lives!)  April and her staff are excellent and work hard to help every one of the children succeed and be ready for kindergarten.  This is a safe, loving, and Christian environment and a superb foundation to help our children have healthy, productive lives in body, mind and spirit.
5	St James Preschool is hands down one of the best preschools I have ever seen! The staff is very energetic and enthusiastic and caring. The children are loved and nurtured. The children who attend St James Preschool are definitely well prepared for Kindergarten. Ms April and Ms Bev are wonderful teachers. The small class sizes allow for each child to grow and progress at their own speed. Pastor Susan is so great with the children! They look forward to going to Chapel. I just can't say enough wonderful things about St James Preschool!
5	St James' curriculum is carefully designed to meet children's developmental needs, their abilities and their interests. Directors, teachers and staff are dedicated and caring. I highly recommend St James to families with young children to attend.
