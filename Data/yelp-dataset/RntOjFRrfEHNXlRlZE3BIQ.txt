3	I stopped by this odd lamps and wall-hangings store a couple of weekends after Christmas. It's a bit of a puzzle to me; the prices are cheap (as are the goods) but it's got the patina of a nicer place than it really is.Overall, it makes me think of the sea of sameness stucco and terra cotta suburbs. If your house looks like everybody else's house in the neighborhood, this is where you got things to decorate your living room. There are 40 options of metal art in brick red, pale pine green, and various shades of brown, and lots of big bowls of wicker balls. Not really my style.The staff is ok, and there is plenty of parking.

3	Kirklands is one of my favorite stores! With that being said...This particular one leaves a lot to be desired. Even though they seem like they have a lot of merchandise, they are very cramped inside the store. I would feel more comfortable walking through with less stuff than walking through being afraid to hit something.Prices are good - but I wouldn't buy anything unless it was on sale or if I had a coupon for it.
