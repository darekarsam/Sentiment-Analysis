4	This place provides the following services:  Fingerprinting, TB skin testing, Flu shots, CPR classes, etc.  It is a little hard to find since it is nestled at the back side of the building.  But once you find the door, you are set.  I had to get fingerprinting done and so I went in, signed in, paid $15, got fingerprinted, and I was DONE.  The whole process took....10min?If you need fingerprinting, this is a good place to go.*Service = very nice.  The lady who helped me was very communicative and made you feel comfortable.*Price = I know that there are $10/card places but I would definitely go back to this place for the $5 extra if I need another service.*Location = at first glance, you might think...really? neon signs?...but once you get in, you see that it is a legitimate business.
5	Prompt, courteous service but for the love of all that is holy please stop cracking your gum! I don't know how a person can make gum sound so gross. Couldn't get out of there fast enough. Nice people but EWWW. ETA: I changed my rating from 3 stars to 5, because the gum thing was quickly addressed in the nicest way possible. Thanks guys. You will be my company's go to folks for all future fingerprinting needs.
5	Needed some fingerprint cards and found this place. Everyone was really nice and my prints turned out perfect. The technician took special care to make sure there were no smudges. Will definitely be back next time I need prints!
