2	They do great quality work. The only reason I did not give them five stars is for their lack of customer courtesy not once but twice. I am a very patient and understanding person, but being rude twice means you dont want my business and I tipped 20%.
5	This place is amazing!!! Jim is a great artist!!! Traveled all the way from Tampa just to get my tattoo!!! I would recommend this place to everyone!!!
5	Got my first tattoo here in 1993 and my second a couple weeks later. All these Years later they still look great. Haven't faded much and haven'tHad em touched up. The shop is Professional and clean, I highly Recommend. Excellent quality work.
