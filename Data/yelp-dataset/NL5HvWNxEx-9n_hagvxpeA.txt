5	Nice place v-good hookah Small but cozy place nice and perfect hookah Afordeble prices in charlotte
4	This is not my first Hookah Bar so there were certain things I could compare. The location is not in the best neighborhood but I felt safe and comfortable. The ambience was relaxing and the staff was very polite and inviting. Not only is it the cheapest Hookah Bar i've been to but they even had other ways to save money. Though they serve no alcohol they are very accommodating. Not only will I go back but I will take others.
5	Great spot to chill The owners very nice and wants to make sure you're comfortable good prices when you get there ask what drinks they have and what flavors they have because they change daily all in all great place
5	Hookah Hot Spot is a hidden treasure!!!! Love it!!! I have been hooked ever since I found them on Facebook. Eden and the staff are very nice and the atmosphere is very relaxing. The cinnamon tea is amazing and I recommend Blue Mist Hookah.
