1	Absolute worst customer service ever. I sent an email with my specs on 11/13 to James. He said he would work it up and get back to me. He never did. I followed up with him on 11/19 and he said he will work it up and have it to me by Friday 11/22. He immediately charged by credit card. Still no call or completion. I called up once again on Wedneday 11/27 and asked about the status. James was not in the office and called back on Monday 12/2 to find out nothing was done, no production at all. James apologized and said he would have it by the end of the day. I asked to speak to Dominic the manager who seemed like it was not a big issue at all, so then I spoke to Ernie the owner. I told him I was trying to get signs done since 4 weeks ago and James consistenty dropped the ball. I asked for a full refund and will take my business elsewhere. I was referred to a Realtor that does quite a big business with them and really disappointed. Highly recommend to go somewhere else. You get what you pay for and this place has zero customer service.
1	I'm not sure where I should start.  Maybe the fact that it took them three  weeks to get artwork to me.  Maybe I should start with that I was told I was being charged a $50 mark art work but was actually charged $550 for signs when I haven't even picked our the type of sign material I wanted yet.  Or maybe I should talk about how the owner did not accept any responsibility.  Or maybe I should talk about how they only completed half of the order and then completed the other half a week later and never bothered to tell me. Or maybe I should talk about the fact that we told me I could go **%* my mother.  Beside that I guess overall it was a pretty good experience.
1	Had a horrible experience with this company a few months ago. My story sounds very similar to the ones posted on here already. Incredibly lousy customer service and an owner who could give a damn about filling orders and delivering service.
