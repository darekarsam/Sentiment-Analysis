4	I just moved to Las Vegas and I was tired of sleeping on the floor. I finally saved up enough money to buy some furniture, so I decided to check this place out. CORT specializes in furniture rental, but I was more interested in their second hand, clearance stuff. They have a small selection, but I think the furniture was reasonably priced for the quality you get. Service was friendly, but I don't like how they charge for shipping. $50 bucks to drop off the bed 1.7 miles away? that's cool. Just put it on this shopping cart and I will roll my used mattress home.
5	I have to say SCOTT AND JIMMESE ARE AMAZING.. I has to furnish almost a whole home and being new to the area... They HOOKED ME UP!! Jimmese is pleasant, listens, and gave me great feedback. Scott was just amazing at putting the deal together and getting me what I needed.. Can't wait to open more homes and get to work with these two again
5	Big shout out to the whole crew at CORT LAS VEGAS!! Furnishing 3 Recovery Homes is not easy, but Scott, Jimese, and their crew are unstoppable when it comes to putting it all together!! Thanks everyone .. See ya soon!!
3	The back part of the store is rental furniture. They then will sell the rental furniture once they are done with it. I personally had went to check out the stuff for sale and not the rental furniture. I guess rental furniture would be nice if you were staging a home or something. The furniture for sale was priced super high. I was very surprised considering this is used furniture. Some of the couches were in the high hundreds and had stains on them. I could buy the same brand new couch at Ashley and get s better deal. Was pretty disappointed. This was a walk in, walk out and never go back sort of place for me.
