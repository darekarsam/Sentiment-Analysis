5	My 60 minute massage was a real stress reliever and the hot stones felt so wonderful.  I have fibromyalgia, which is chronic pain, so some of the trigger points Julie gently massaged felt so much better after the treatment.  I would highly recommend the hot stones as part of your massage.  Julie made my home feel like a get-away spa, so whether you go to their location or stay home you will feel very special.  Enjoy
5	Julie Fleck,LMST of Steel City Massage is an expert hot stone massage therapist.  I play sports regularly, and her treatment loosens my muscles up and gets rid of the soreness.  Highly recommend her, and she makes you feel at ease.
5	Julie is truly a miracle worker. I woke up yesterday with a horrific back spasm (so bad I had to call in reinforcements in order to get dressed/put up my hair for work...getting my arms into that suit jacket was a killer). I was truly freaked out as I have a particularly busy week ahead and couldn't afford to be immobile. After I called Steel City Massage and left a kind of frantic message requesting deep tissue work, Julie fit me in same-day. Julie was incredibly sweet and knowledgable about anatomy. She immediately discovered the problem and answered any questions I had every step of the way. But what really stands out is how I feel today: The last time I had a similar spasm, the injury lasted almost a week before I felt like I could move properly again (and I went to one of the most highly recommended massage therapists in DC that time too); this time, I am still a bit sore today but my mobility is entirely back and I bet I'll be 100% tomorrow or the next day at the latest. Julie is amazing.
