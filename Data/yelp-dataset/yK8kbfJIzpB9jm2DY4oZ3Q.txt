5	I went in to Fast Forward for fascial stretch therapy. I had injured my back very badly the week before and needed relief. I am so glad that I went in. Marsha stretched all of the muscles that were extremely tight and causing so much pain. It was so much more beneficial then a massage. She was extremely knowledgable due to her training and background in fitness and kinesiology. I felt the benefits immediately. If you are athletic, this is something you should do on a regular basis. I will be making appointments regularly at Fast Forward.
5	I was lucky enough to find Dr. Al at a race venue where he was volunteering his time to consult athletes about the advantages of chiropractic care.  I immediately knew that he was going to be a great addition to my life and I was right. I've been pain free , sleeping like I've never slept before, and after going through his initial program, I've biked and ran the fastest I've have in a very long time.  Racing in the pro circuit in AZ, I've seen such huge success this year over prior years and I believe that he is one of the great contributors.  Not letting Fast Forward or Dr. Al of my life any time soon.Thanks a bunch,Kata
5	I connected with Dr. Al through a track practice group he coordinated before launching his own business. When I later encountered symptoms of IT Band injury when beginning my running training, I called on Dr. Al for help in diagnosis and treatment. He has successfully eliminated my discomfort by treating the root cause behind the injury, which has produced more than the physical results - now I feel stronger, walk with better posture, and have improved balance. I am convinced that Chiropractic care is important to overall good health and fitness, and I'm happy I found a doctor who is willing to "run" the journey with me, encouraging me along the way! Thanks Dr. Al!
