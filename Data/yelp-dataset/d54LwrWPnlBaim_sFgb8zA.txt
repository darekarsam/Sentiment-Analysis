1	Never dealt with a more unprofessional company. I had my car booted and was told to walk to an ATM bc they couldn't take a card. The driver literally made a finger walking signal and told me hit the pavement. He used profanity. What an awful human being.
1	Horribly rude company! Booted every vehicle in the parking lot and played a "chase me around the lot" game in his truck when people were trying to get his attention about getting their boots removed (several had young children). Profane group of men running this "company." They were VERY reckless with several of the cars they towed out as well.
1	The most unprofessional person I have ever dealt with. My car was booted with a block of wood and a cable lock. When I asked to see a business card or anything that was work related he called the cops. The whole situation was a shady shake down.
1	My car was towed by Dixie Towing.  They do not adhere to the city ordinance on towing.  I called to get my car at 5:20am.  They told me that they did not open until 9:00am and that I would need to call in advance prior to coming.  After looking at the ordinance I found that they needed to release the car within 45 minutes of my request.  When I called them and told them that what they were doing was illegal  they stated that they told me that because they didn't want me standing out in the cold.  Once I got to the location to pick up the car I informed them that I was going to inform the city of their business practices.  The man started yelling at me and telling me that my daddy should be ashamed of the way I am acting.  Completely demeaning.  I was not the one acting unethically.  They were.  Know your rights when you are towed.  Make sure that you hold these companies accountable.
