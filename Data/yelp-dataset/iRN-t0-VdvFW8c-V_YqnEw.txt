4	This place was nice and the staff is very friendly. They have a variety of Renaissance clothing, some of which you can wear on a daily basis. Their clothing is pretty and great for Renn Faires; however, I was not amazed by the quality of fabric. Their jewelry is great and unique. Their rings are nice but a bit pricey. They also carry weapons and leather armor.They also have a section for home decor and incense. It's a nice place on Saint Hubert to visit!
