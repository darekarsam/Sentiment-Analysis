5	I am so grateful to Nancy at lymphatic healing center.  My doctor sent me to her post surgery to help with the pain and swelling.  She is AMAZING.  I was swollen and miserable when I went to see her.  Her massage reduced the swelling and helped move the toxins through my lymphatic system.  I went back for several treatments and I healed much faster and better than I would have on my own.  I highly recommend The Lymphatic Healing  Center.
5	I had reconstructive breast surgery in February.My left breast has capsular contraction.This is caused by the body creating a web like cover.It required massage so that the breast is not rock hard.Nancy after 2 sessions is progressing and I feel so much better.Wish I had found her sooner.Surgeons should enlighten there patientsOr maybe it is the other way around.Very gentle  her massage is based around the lymphatic system.The whole experience is calming.This is special unique way to get your system moving.A real,plus for people with capsular contraction.I am grateful. WendyThe package deals are really goodA real find
5	I feel so grateful that my surgeon's office provided me with Nancy's information. I had a mommy makeover surgery and was completely bruised, swollen & uncomfortable. I couldn't imagine someone massaging the areas, but after one treatment I could feel the benefits. Nancy is so reassuring & knowledgable. She is a great support system. Her ly,phatic massages are soothing & the infrared sauna available for after the massage truly makes a huge difference. I leave every treatment feeling calm & in less pain. After only 4 treatments I can see a huge difference. My swelling & bruising is so improved. Even the nurse at my 3 week post op appointment was shocked at how well I was healing!
