4	This place is really nice. I still don't quite understand their points system, but it seems to be a good idea from my grasp on it.And 8 dollars for a basic tan? You can't beat that with a stick.The beds are great and I don't know if all their locations do, but their little boutique inside is adorable.Definitely one of my favorites.
4	The first time I went there, I went with my mom who was a first time tanner. The girl who helped was very informative, sweet and helpful. I like how they don't make you buy your own pair of goggles. They provide you with a sanitary pair. They also have a wide selection of lotions and the girls are very helpful with helping you pick them out.
1	*ATTENTION* Very horrible customer service. They do not have mirrors anywhere but the nasty bathroom. And when you cancel in the beginning of the month. They don't credit you for the month you paid for even if you haven't and won't be using it. Horrible place. I recommend nobody tan at this dirty place.
