5	Wow!  Is all I can say every time I look at the kitchen after these guys installed our new counter tops today.  Very professional, courteous and punctual for both the measurement consultation and the installation. The installation crew were very polite and awesome to work with, explained every step of the install process.  Highly recommend these guys.
5	Excellent Workmanship and serviceI ordered granite countertops from Superior and was pleasantly surprised at the whole process. From initial call, to looking at the samples to scheduling and installation, there were no surprises and the price was competitive. I highly recommend
5	John has done about 5 kitchens and about 8 bathrooms for us. Great jobs all. Even once when he did the Carrara marble surround for a special jetted tub, the marble cracked a little, about 3 inches. My husband said, forget it. All will crack there.  But John said, no. I don't accept this and he came back with a whole new slab and put the perfect piece in. What a guy. Very very professional. Plus one time I needed a stainless backsplash. Everyone said, you can't cut the granite backsplash to be straight. Al the tile guys said, just leave it. I asked John, and he came the next day and carefully cut exactly perfect. Great guy. If he can't do it, he will tell you. But very very competent and honest. You do not get ripped off.
