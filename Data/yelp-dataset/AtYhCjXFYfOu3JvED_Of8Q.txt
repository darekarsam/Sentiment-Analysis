1	So I'm running late for work but I'm hungry so as I'm going down Craig rd I see a lite up carls jr, so I turn around now definantly going to be late. So I pull into the drive thru all the lights are on inside & out the menu board is lite up the screen is even lite up so I wait, I honk a few times-nothing so I'm still in a hurry and I pull up to the window and honk and even knock on the window and nothing...... Why would everything be lite up and their closed??? How ignorant and rude! It's one thing to have on your cj signs but every lite? I believe that's called false advertisement..... Well I'm late and still hungry cj thanks for nothing!!!
4	I haven't been to a Carl's Jr. for many years.  I was out running some errands and needed some food.  This Carls's Jr. was very efficiently ran with very good employees.  The staff was very friendly and my order was prepared in about five minutes.  The entire order tasted great and was accurate.  The lobby was very clean as were the restrooms.  My experience was very good and I would happily return to this location in the future.
