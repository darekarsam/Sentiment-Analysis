1	If only a NEGATIVE STAR was possible , a place to AVOID ,DO NOT GO THERE , our party of 10 , has reservation for 730pm did not get seated till 9pm as all the other restaurant we fully booked had no choice but to stay, the BS excuse they gave us was we were not complete and did not seat us, once we sat down bread came 20 min after we placed our order, food finally came at 1030pm,my fillet minion TEMP was overkilled,the attitude the waitress gave me was "you asked for ?? " I told her its too well done , she kiss her teeth and picked it up, because we were a group of 10 the tip was forced on to our bills, and no managers in sight all night , this place need new management go spend you money elsewhere ,
