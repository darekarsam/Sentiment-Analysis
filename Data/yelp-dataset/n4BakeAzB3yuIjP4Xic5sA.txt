3	Stayed here for 2 nights for the last leg of my NC trip. The hotel was really nice with a pretty breakfast area, outside gazebo, and really big rooms. The staff was always very friendly and the location was excellent (lots of shopping options nearby for a solo-traveling woman).
4	This a nice hotel. I stayed here for work and they accommodated us in every aspect. The happy hour was awesome after a long day and they have relationships with restaurants around the area that gave us discounts. I hope we stay here again!
1	Probably the worst nights sleep I have had. The room was nice and clean. A little pricy for a HIX but worst of all was the noise from water pipes (or something) all night long. On and off like the tank on the toilet bowl refilling. Ours did it and above or below was doing it as well. I usually have better results and never have to worry. Unfortunately this stay wasn't as pleasurable.
4	Was good - nothing to complain for a std. holiday inn express: price is a lil' bit higher due to the big mall and speedway in "walking distance".Front desk is taking care, breakfest is as same as in every HIX. Hotel as a small gym, with a few threadmills and a pool during summer season...My room was new and quite = all good
