5	Took my Mazda 3 in with a battery dying as I arrived. Got me right in, replaced and also found that I had a blown fuse for phone charger. Replace that as a courtesy! As luck would have it, our other vehicles car battery is going, so today I called and set an appointment. We will be visiting them this morning.
1	Close to 4 hours for an alignment when I was told 2. Also had a reservation on saturday that they said it would be done in 2 hours. They didnt get it done on saturday either. Wasted 3 hours of my time then. I have tried out a few auto repair places in Fountain Hills. Worst by far. Don't come here. No problem for saving you time. Car finally done then it comes back with dirt all over the door.
4	Had to unexpectedly visit Sun Devil this past Saturday *dramatic sigh* due to my car being "sluggish" as I tried to start her.Held my breath and was hoping it was something simple (i.e. battery), and sure enought it was. Oh, and a cable of some sort?Service was speedy Gonzalez, but they could probably be a tad more professional (i.e. techs slumped over in their chairs, fiddling on his cell, probably on Tinder app and looking to score an impulsive, hot date?). But, perhaps my expectations are too high and rigid - after all, it is a auto repair shop, it ain't the Ritz, right?!?
1	If I could give this place a zero I would. The repairs which I had done, turned into more repairs which were preventable. PleaseSave yourself some money and take your business elsewhere.
