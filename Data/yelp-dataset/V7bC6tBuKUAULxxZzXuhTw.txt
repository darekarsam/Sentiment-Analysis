5	I was recommended this place by my attorney when I got into a car accident. The doctors and the staff is great, all friendly, and most of them know you by your name even without looking at charts. They have very little wait time, and have same day appointments. I think the longest I was in there was still less than an hour. Great place, I'd recommend it.
5	The care and understanding of the staff at neck and back clinic is unbeatable you are always treated with the most professional customer service and big smiles from all the staff
5	Another great location from Neck and Back.  I am a computer IT and always have back problems, after a few adjustments they always have me up and going.  Thanks !
