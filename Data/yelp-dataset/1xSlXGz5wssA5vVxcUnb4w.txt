4	Nice campground - pristine bathrooms (critical measurement) - nice pool - ample play areas - near the cheese store....only thing keeping this from a 5 star is the RV slabs are gravel and not concrete. (Lots of dirt to track inside)
5	Friendly, courteous staff who explained features of the campground and the general area.  Nice touch that a campground person guides you to your site, disinfects the water hookup, and checks that the water is working. Sites are wide, easy access and nicely mowed.  Loved that there is trash AND recycling for campers. Excellent playground with wide area for kids to burn off energy.  Bathrooms were very clean & organized well.  Only drawback is the proximity to the interstate, there is the constant hum of traffic in the background.  But that is what happens with easy access.
