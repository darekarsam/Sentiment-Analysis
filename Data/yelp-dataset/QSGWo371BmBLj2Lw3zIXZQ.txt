2	I visited Dairy Queen off of 27th Avenue and Carefree Hwy and ordered a "Brownie Sundae" I also ordered a "Peanut Buster" parfait at the drive thru.  Once at home, I opened the bag and there was only vanilla ice cream with brownies on top. I returned to the DQ and indicated that my order is incorrect, and I explained what I received and they said well this is what you ordered.  I stated it should have hot fudge.  The young person so called "apologized" then replied, "Well you have to be specific when ordering as we have a peanut sundaes, marshmallow, and so on.  I then said, "I guess I will know for next time".   Now I wonder if I ordered their promotional "Oreo Brownie Earthquake Sundae" are you telling me that it will only have Oreo cookies and brownies on the sundae?  When people are trained proper customer service you do not make the customer be wrong and pretend you are doing them a favor.  That is one way to not have a returning customer.
1	I ordered my Oreo blizzard with extra Oreo. Never got the extra. Went back through the drive-through ordered it again with extra Oreo and paid twice did not get the extra oreo. This is what happens when you have young kids running a store and nobody that actually cares about what's going on. I would never have a bunch of high school kids that are just goofing around, in control of my money. I've been there a few times they just hand the blizzard without a lid and no bag and it's already melting and spilling over...no napkins. This owner needs to get it together. He probably makes so much money he doesn't care. Not going back enough is enough.
