5	Franco's is excellent Italian fare - as good as it gets - as good and better than some of the food we had in Florence, Siena and Rome two weeks ago.   The antipasti plate - have it with the white anchovies!  Burrata, melon, proscuitto, red peppers excellent.  Veal scallopini - great sauce and the seafood risotto excellent.  Fresh ingredients - olive oil, surprised it is from CA - CORTO and can be purchased at AJs - is very good.   Franco is charming and a great chef.
5	Ever since we discovered this place we have been going weekly. It is small, cozy, and very friendly but most of all, the food and service are top notch. We have been to Italy twice this year and eating here is just as good. Many of the customers are repeats, and for good reason -- it's a quality place. It has about 20 tables and a four seat bar, the wine list is adequate and the food choices superb. Seafood risotto, several pasta choices, veal and fresh fish are available nightly, and if you try one of the Italian deserts you will be hooked for sure. If you want a quiet, friendly and very memorable Italian meal, this is your choice in Scottsdale for sure.
5	if you want excellent authentic Italian cuisine this is the only place to go.  Great service, delicious food made with quality ingredients. Franco,  the owner is always there making sure everything is perfect. And it always is. We have gone several times and no Rmatter what we order it it top notch. Our last trip was Christmas Eve and I shared the the seafood medley or as the Italians know it as the seven fishes with my mother. It was a combo of a 1/2 lobster, crab, shrimp, sea bass, clams, mussels and calamari and we both had more than enough. My husband had one of the veal dishes and he said it was delicious and had a fabulous sauce. We shared the tiramisu and the maringatta both are great and can't be missed. You won't be disappointed.
