2	Being this well-known American chain, I made it a point to visit this location.I won't be doing that again.The food is fine: burgers are fresh and delicious, fries are meh, rings are good.But holy mother of god is this place *grossly* overpriced.My family of 4 (one of which was a 2 year old girl) cost north of $50!So while the food is delicious, you can still get better for *far far far* less.
5	I've been wanting to try Carl Jrs for a long time, finally we have one in Ontario! This was a really great burger.  I had the BBQ Texas Burger.  It was incredible, the fresh made buns really add to it too.   I will be back here over and over.Note..this is not a typical fast food...if you're looking for a value menu price, then go to McDs.  This is quality, along the line of 5 Guys.  But so worth it!
2	I was excited to see this supposedly great chain expand into Waterloo. I thought it was something worth trying. If I can summarize what Carl's Jr tastes like, it's overpriced Burger King food.Their sizes are one size smaller than McDonald's. So a McDonald's large is a Carl's Jr medium. I ended up with a medium fry and medium drink that were a lot larger than I expected.The fries were okay... they were your typical average frozen fast food fries. The burger was nothing special. It was just an over-priced version of a Burger King Whopper with cheese.Maybe the other specialty burgers are worth it, but then you'd be spending $15-20 per person and might as well go to a formal sit down restaurant.In summary: Meh.
