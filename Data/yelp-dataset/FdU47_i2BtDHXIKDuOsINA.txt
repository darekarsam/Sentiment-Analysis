5	Chris is as good as it gets! I've hired at least 10 handymen for various jobs over the last nine years in real estate and most have been terrible. Chris arrived on-time to meet me at the property, gave me his honest assessment of the repairs, and delivered an extremely reasonable bid to me within an hour of leaving. I hired him for the job and he was able to take care of it over the course of two days. What I admired most was his communication, keeping me informed as he went along. He knew I had a deadline and completely worked with me to get the job done in a very timely fashion. There were a few small problems that cropped up during his repairs and he immediately called me from the property to discuss them and ascertain the best course of action. I totally trusted his opinion and he didn't let me down. The repairs were completed as scheduled and the work was excellent. He repaired a faulty doorbell, reworked some shoddy wiring on a sprinkler timer, fixed a drain issue under the kitchen sink and installed a new cabinet facing on the end of the bottom cabinets. He truly cares about his work and takes a lot of pride in it as well and it shows. Thanks Chris for your valuable time and hard work! I'm looking forward to calling you soon for another job!
