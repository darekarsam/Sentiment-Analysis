4	I recently had an oil change at this location and enjoyed the hassle free environment. No aggressive up selling or attempts to sign me up for the company credit card. As a result of closing their other location on Indy Blvd expect a couple hour wait on an oil change unless you hit them up when they first open.
5	Have bought Tires for my Jag here, Took my cadillac in for tire install and alignment knew it needed repair at rear brake/axel had them do a quote and perform the work. the car gave them fits but they did the work and cost was even lower than quoted due to some parts not being needed. Will be coming back with one of my other Cadillacs for tire install next week.
1	Tried to use a coupon for a $20 oil change.  Manager looked up my car and tells me the manufacturer recommends using a synthetic so the coupon cannot be used.  I tell him to look at the history of oil changes (at Merchant's) and sure enough, they all used conventional 5W-30.  Nevertheless, he goes into a rant about not being responsible for wrecking my engine, which is all an absolute crock.  See: http://www.edmunds.com/car-care/top-7-urban-legends-about-motor-oil.htmlBottom line: I won't be taking my car here for anything in the future, especially tires.  I had a valid coupon for an oil change and wanted to use it.  I've also prepaid for a lifetime of tire rotations/balancing that I can no longer use at this location since this manager thinks it's ok to steal from customers and treat them as if they are stupid.
