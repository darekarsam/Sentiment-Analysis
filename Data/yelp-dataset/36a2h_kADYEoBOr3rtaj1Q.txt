3	Ya Gotta Regatta! It's Pittsburgh's mid summer July 4th celebration. Once it was the largest inland regatta in the nation with an average 1 Million people visiting for the four day event. Scaled back these days for reasons I won't get into, the annual summer spectacular features boat racing, anything that floats contests, a lighted boat parade, concerts, and the huge July  4Th fireworks display. Best of all, it's free!
4	Oh, I had fun here. They just need more portapottys. It's something to do and somewhere to people watch. And the fireworks were pretty.
