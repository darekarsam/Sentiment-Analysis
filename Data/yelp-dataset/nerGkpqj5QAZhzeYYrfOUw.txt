4	It seems odd to describe Cheap Thrills as a stalwart fixture of Montreal's downtown, considering the apparent uncertainty of a stone 3-story walk-up within a sea of skyscrapers, shopping complexes, and parking facilities, and the general shabbiness of its second-story location, but they've been around since 1971 and they're still alive and kicking, so there you go.  In fact, you might even consider Cheap Thrills something of an oasis, given the state of things.  The thrills in question come in the form of LPs, CDs, and books.  CDs and LPs come new and used.  Books are strictly second-hand.  Most of the above qualify as "cheap."  Cheap Thrills is a tiny operation, but the shelves run high and they're generally well-stocked with auditory and literary finds of all kinds.  On the music side, they specialize in rock, jazz, soul, indie, beats, and experimental, and their collection could safely be labeled "savvy."
4	I can't believe I never reviewed this place.By far the best record store in Montreal. Most interesting collections, both new and old, most fair pricing, and old school knowledgeable staff. I love Cheap Thrills so much.
5	Awesome place.  Cheap used records, books, and CDs as well as new records and concert tickets.  Cool place to just browse for a while.  Music lovers need to check it out.
