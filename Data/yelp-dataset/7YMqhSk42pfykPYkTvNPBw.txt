4	Up a few steps then your in sort of place. Tailors is central and I assume run by two or three women - they always seem to be there when I'm in; not sure if they are sisters, but they give off that vibe like they've been running this business for years they are also pretty vocal and like to share thoughts and ideas.A constantly busy place, brides in getting alterations done to dresses, peeps handing in or collecting trousers(what I was doing), fitting rooms to the left, working area to right of the reception with sewing machines buzzing.In all an ok service, maybe not as cheap as supermarkets to get your garments dry cleaned, but at least they most defo won't come back to you in a worse state like it might with a bigger chain, I've heard this can happen!Trousers cleaned within 3 working days, but just make sure you keep your ticket, or goodness knows what items you or the brides might end up with?!
