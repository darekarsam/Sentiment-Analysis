5	I have had the opportunity to work with Eitan on a couple of transactions (I am a realtor) and he has come through both times and my clients loved him.  I have had more rough experiences with loan officers then I care to remember so its GREAT when you meet a good one!  Keep up the good work Eitan and I'm sure we will do more business in the future!
5	Eitan is extremely knowledgeable and helpful! We went to Eitan to help us with our credit to ensure we would be approved to buy a home in the future. Will definitely be going to him when the time is right to purchase a home!
5	Been with him for years ( I'm an investor). Smooth, easy transactions. He's very knowledgable, professional, knows all the ins and outs of loans.
5	Eitan Took all the stress out of my purchase. He's easy to work with and very professional. I will definitely be using him again in the future and would highly recommend him.
5	Highly recommend Eitan. Professional, timely and on point.
4	Like the service and the urgency in this company.Always with a smile!!
