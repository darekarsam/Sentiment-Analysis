4	Opened just in the past few days, so I and a co-worker decided to try it.The restaurant is very clean and just built, and is well laid out. They've got plenty of seating and the kitchen area is in clear view as you walk in. When they make sandwiches, you can see them making it fresh.I had the Cornbeef Deluxe and a smoothie. The Cornbeef was fresh and tasty, and was carved after I ordered my food. The smoothie was fresh made with natural ingredients - I had the Strawberry lemonade, and it used only ice, lemons, and strawberries. The smoothie was a bit more sour than I like my lemonade, since it didn't appear to have any sugar in it, but was well within the scope of a good lemonade.The serving sizes were good and the food was tasty. It would've been nice to have some chips or a side salad included with the sandwich, but the sandwich was large enough that a side wasn't necessary to make the meal filling.The service was friendly and there were only a few trivial issues with the staff getting accustomed to the new restaurant. The only reason it didn't earn a fifth star was because the cost was a bit higher than I would've liked (~$8.50 for a sandwich and smoothie, with no side.) Nevertheless, I plan on returning there again for lunch.
4	Great service and clean restaurant.  Good smoothies and I liked the fact that it was all fruit (no sugar added).
