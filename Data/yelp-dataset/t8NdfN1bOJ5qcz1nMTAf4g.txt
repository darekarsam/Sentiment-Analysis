3	Review for breakfast visits, both dine in and drive through.  Food quality is on par with other McDonalds but sometimes things can take a long time here, even if they aren't very busy.  I'm not sure why.  Interior space is cramped too after they remodeled, or at least it certainly feels that way.  Location is easy to spot though on the north side of the street, near the Adobe Dam golf course.
5	One of the cleanest kids play places I've been to.  Great clean overall restraint!  Good service and fast!  Close to wet n wild!
1	I never thought I'd be reviewing a McDonald's, because I do not support McDonald's and am ashamed of myself every time I go, but I just have to say...I have been going to this McDonald's since it was first built. While their inside is pretty clean and nicely renovated, I never go inside, so my review is in regards to their drive through. I would say that 9 out of the 10 times that I go there, they mess up my order. I have just grown to expect that I won't get what I ordered. Ask for grilled chicken? You'll get crispy. Ask for coffee with no sugar? It will be sweet as hell. Oh, and also, over the past couple of months I have noticed that they NEVER fill up their fries all the way anymore! Good grief.
