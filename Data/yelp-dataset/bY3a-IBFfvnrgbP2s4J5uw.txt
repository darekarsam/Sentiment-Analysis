2	The sushi is far from traditional, the food is overcomplicated and doesn't make sense.  For example, the bottles on the table say Kikkoman, but when I asked why it didn't taste right they claimed the chef buys a special and much more expensive sauce for the Kikkoman bottles.  I can attest it wasn't better and strange that they would fill branded bottles with something entirely different.  The sushi rice tasted very bland and contained some hard rice.  My impression was they need to focus on getting the basics right before they expand their menu in a creative direction.
