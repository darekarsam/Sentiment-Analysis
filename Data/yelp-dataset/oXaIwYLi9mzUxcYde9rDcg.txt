5	Great experience! We had a string quartet for our wedding (Steve Ehrlich strings) and they did a very nice job, were subtle but present and definitely knew what they were doing. Contact and communication before the wedding was very good too. Definitely recommended - and our guests really liked the live music!
3	I recently had my 21 birthday and booked Entertainment Unlimited to DJ at my party. I had talked to him we worked out types of music and a playlist that would best fit my party and it's theme. He got there on time and was set up before my party guests showed up. It was the best party I've ever had, he was interactive and got everyone dancing! Overall it was a great time and I would be happy to recommend them to anyone.
