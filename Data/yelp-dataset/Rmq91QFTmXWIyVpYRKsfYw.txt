5	I had a problem with my A/C unit and called out a big name company. First they said they fixed and they didn't. Then, they decided that I needed a new unit. So glad I decided to get quotes from others and met Mike and Brian! These guys have it together! I got a clear explanation of several options on a new unit. The installation went smoothly and on time. I love my new unit and am enjoying the 2 stage comfort! They were priced quite a bit less than the big name company for the same unit, but I chose them for their integrity and professionalism. After 25 years in Arizona, I finally have an A/C company for life.
5	We have used Evans for years.  Last year we got quotes from 6 different companies to replace our air conditioner.  Evans was far & away the best, and they did a great job putting in the new ac.  We had a faulty wire that caused an issue just after installation, at 7pm on a friday night.  Brian was out within an hour & fixed the problem in just minutes.  We would recommend them to everyone.  Thanks Evans AC!
5	Evans was wonderful!! Michael arrived promptly, showed his business card at the door, and was clean cut and friendly. He had the necessary part in his truck and was able to make the repair quickly and for a reasonable price. I will most definitely use them again and highly recommend them to others.
