5	awesome service center. I had taken my minivan to a smaller mechanic who claimed he couldnt find anything wrong. called Cochran and they got me an appointment fast and found the issue. they did a thorough check and found my brakes needed to be relaced(which I had suspected). They called when they said they would and completed the work quickly and did a great job. Rates very reasonable. Will consider them my new service center.
1	Do not bring your car here to be serviced. Between April 2013 and February 2014 I spent $3000 at this dealership on servicing for my Hyundai Santa Fe.Given this, and because I had brought the vehicle in April to have the AC checked out because it was acting up. I was expecting a relatively clean inspection when I returned in May. Instead I was quoted a rate of $2000 for exhaust repairs to pass inspection. Given how much I had already spent I decided to get a second opinion from an independent mechanic. The independent mechanic was able to do the same work to pass inspection for a $1000.So their parts and labor are overpriced by a factor of 2. Of the $3000 I spent on repairs $2400 was repair work for the AC. The independent mechanic suggested the issues we had been experiencing with the AC could have been related to the exhaust because it was in such bad shape. Given the amount of times I brought the vehicle in to be looked at. The fact this was missed and allowed to develop into a larger problem was disturbing. At the very least something should have been detected when I brought the car in for an AC check up in April when instead I was told everything was fine.Now I am concerned the $2400 of repair work for the AC was not even required and the issue had been with the exhaust all along.I certainly will not be returning here in the future given I do not feel I can trust they will do the right things for a fair price.
