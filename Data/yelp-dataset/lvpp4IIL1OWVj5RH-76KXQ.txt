2	Very dissatisfied. I'm from out of town and came in to fix the glass on my iphone5 which has shattered. When I came in to pick it up the glass was not set in flat due to an edge of my phone slightly dinged. After multiple times telling him I was not happy & basically saying I wasn't paying for it in that condition. He took it to the back and 50min later came back out with it fixed. I asked why it wasn't given to me like this the first time and he just shrugged without apology or care for the length of time or having to re-fix it. My experience was Horrible quality & customer service.  Unless you're going to stand up for yourself & demand quality service I wouldn't recommend bringing your phone here. He would have gladly let me walk out the first time with a crooked glass... even after I complained.
5	Brought my phone here after living with a cracked screen for months. They were able to fix my screen in barely an hour and I got my phone back like new. Would definitely recommend this place to friends and family...far and away cheaper an easier than getting a new phone!
5	I made an appointment, was taken early, had my repair done as promised. No up charges or surprises. The service was great and is a good value.
