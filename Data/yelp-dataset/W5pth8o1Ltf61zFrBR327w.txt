3	This is a pretty small library but it's fine if you're just picking up items that are on hold. The staff is friendly but the hours are weird. One summer day there was a sign on the door, "Closed early due to heat," which I found bizarre.
4	Being the book nerd that I am , the public library has always been a sanctuary for me. The Southside  library will always have a special place in my heart. It was here that I took my first computer classes lol it now feels likes light years ago. This particular library is one of the smaller libraries in Pittsburgh and when I last visited it , the building lacked central air. But it what it didn't have in amenities it more then made up in architectural character and kind librarians.
5	The Southside Libarary is recently revamped.  I ussually go here to get away from work at lunch and study.  Its perfect for that or picking up a book.Tip:  They let you check out a laptop computer with ID and they are a lot faster then the PC's at the desks.It really is nice inside and the staff are friendly.
