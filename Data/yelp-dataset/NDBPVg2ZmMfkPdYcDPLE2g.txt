5	Local pub open for great coffee in the mornings. Full of locals. Friendly owner and staff.
4	Mile Enders know this place as Cafe Social, so I hope this is being posted in the right place. Anyways, this is the doppelganger to Olympico. The coffee is excellent, although I have to admit it's just a knick under Olympico. It's a very warm inviting atmosphere although it's always best to get a latte to go and walk around the hood. I don't know if they serve food, and I couldn't care less. No reason to go there other than for the coffee.
4	The sandwiches here are amazing. Meat sliced fresh when you order it, pressed with hot peppers and pickled eggplant, thin light lovely bread dripping with hot olive oil, a kind of heaven, especially in the leafy sun on the pretty terrasse with it's wooden balustrades, locals leaning in from their bikes all around, writers peering up at you, old folks inside around the bigger round tables, reading the paper or talking slow. A great place for a bangin 2$ latte, or a beer or glass of wine. A beautiful spot to read a book, people watch, have quiet talks, and be inspired.
5	A favourite hangout of mine when visiting Montreal.Intimate and friendly environment and a great pace to hang outdoors on the bench under the tree sipping coffee. I much prefer this place over Olympico.
4	I was always curious  of trying unique coffee with special names. I tried mini me here, which is small latte I guess. 2.25 dollar
5	I'm here every morning. Can't start my day without the coffee and the family ambiance on the terasse. The best.
5	Amazing latte & cappuccino, friendly barista, funky and fun. Outdoor patio. Love this place! (Reasonable prices are a bonus.) Next time I'm in Montreal, I will be back.
