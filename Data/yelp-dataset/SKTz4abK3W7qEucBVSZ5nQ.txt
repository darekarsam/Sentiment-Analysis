3	finally had me some bojangles....yummy yummy in my tummy...the chicken tasted great, gravy, taters, rice was all good too....those biscuits they give you are ginormous!
1	My family and I have been to this location several times and it's always an adventure. The staff seems clueless about their jobs, they mess the order up and they have no regard that the customer is watching all of this. I need to find a different location and let the keystone cops have this location
2	The worst service of any bojangles I've been to. The orders rarely come out right. How hard can it be to put chicken in a box?
