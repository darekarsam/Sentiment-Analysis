5	I absolutely love the fries here. It has a nice small cozy room which barely can sit more than a group of 10 people. They recently renovated the decor and now its more of a cool country food joint-ish. They have a great selection of pizzas and i highly recommend the mexican or spinach one. As mentioned they really have one of the best fries are that really crispy with a unique taste that has made me a fan. The location is terrific right belpfore you hit parc on sherbrooke so its pretty nifty to get around here and out. They also have special deals for students.
5	Almost walked out as soon as we walked in, looked kind of sketchy. Very happy we decided to order though. The pizza was unbelievable, I think this might have been one of the best crusts I have ever had. Thoroughly enjoyed every bite!!  Though it may not look like much from the outside, pizza here is a must try.
5	This is a tiny place but the pizza was great. I am not huge on pizza but it was really good. I stopped there on the fly since it was right outside the hotel.
