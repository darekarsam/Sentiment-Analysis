3	Oh OooH OOoooOOOoH. Bras and panties galore. I think this has to be every womans candy store. I will say for this specific location I'm not a big fan of the whole "whose gonna pounce on the new person in the store first" sales attitude. Let me peruse for my underpants in private first. If I have questions I'll ask. I tend to think these ladies forget that I'm looking for my intimates not buying a new car.Selection is limited due to the fact its been squeezed in on Walnut Street but there's always the Waterfront location if you want to go bat shit looney.
4	I always drop in on their semi annual sales, this one is a particularly small store and they don't carry the victoria's secret Pink line which is both good and bad.  You don't get bombarded with neon colors sequins and such in this store and i can see that someone past their twenties would appreciate that unless they are shopping with their daughter.  You know what you get at vs, this is a more intimate store with not as much selection.
