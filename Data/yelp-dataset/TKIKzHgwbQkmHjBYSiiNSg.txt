5	My dishwasher was not draining water from the bottom. I called up my home owners warranty and set up an appt. first, the guy was late,next he was there over and hour,then he tells me he could not find the problem out and would have to come back with another person!!! My friend came over later and I explained my issue and she referred me to Apex appliance repair. I called the number on a Thursday morning and the technician said he can  come out that day!!! The tech was on time. 15 Minutes into being at my house found the problem. He even explained what the issue was in case it happens again!! He was very professional and the company is very affordable. I will definitely be using this service in the future and recommending them to all my friends.
5	Came highly recommended and I was in need of my dryer being fixed ASAP! Communication was quick, an appointment was made and very quickly after my dryer was fixed. He was very knowledgeable about everything!!! I will definitely use Apex again for any and all appliance repairs!
5	Amazing service!
