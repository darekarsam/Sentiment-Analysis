5	I have done acupuncture for many years in Los Angeles . I  moved to Vegas and was happy to find Dr. Chow.. She is VERY talented and her work is unique.  I felt the difference after 1 visit...  She has a BIG HEART and really cares about her patients.  I highly recommend her!!!!!
5	Linda Chow is Amazing!She is very detailed and you definitley come out feeling like a new person. I had shoulder pain for 4 days and went to see her for other things as well. I literaly left there with no pain.My mind and body are relaxed( which is amazing when you have anxiety).  She is a miricle worker!  She is very caring and follows up with you. I've have recommended other people to her and they love her.
5	Dr Chow is one of the nicest people you will ever meet. She takes her time with you and treats you like family. She treated my dad for 10 weeks and he felt significantly better. She also treated me one day when I brought my dad in. I had a terrible headache and my God she knew exactly what to do. Dr. Chow is smart and she knows her stuff. I love her.
