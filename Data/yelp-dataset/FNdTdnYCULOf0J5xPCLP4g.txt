5	Working with Fred Thomas was a great experience and very easy. He took care of my accident injury case and handled all of the claims for me. Nice to know that even in a smaller accident there's someone there to help you. Thanks Fred
5	Fred was referred to me by a family friend.  He was amazing to work with.  He took care of all the paperwork and made it an easier process.  Thank you Fred!
5	I attended a seminar on auto accidents with Fred Thomas and the information he provided was a great help to understanding my needs for future accidents.  Fred is very knowledgeable, and has been a great resource for me.  I had no idea how important it is to have an attorney when dealing with an auto accident and I now recommend Fred to everyone who is faced with the burden of having a car accident.
5	Fred Thomas has now represented me and my companies on three separate matters and has been professional, expert, accessible, and approachable in each one.  He is readily available, very knowledgeable, flexible, and fluid in response to where each case leads whether it is negotiation, court, or mediation.  If you want your legal needs met with great expertise I strongly recommend both Fred and Jeffrey.  Its not just litigation, it is problem solving and they're great at it.
