5	This is my go-to barber after having lived in Lawrenceville for almost a year now.  At $11 per cut, it is very reasonable and the quality is always top-notch.  The barber, Bob, is quite friendly and always has something interesting and relevant to talk about.  As far as the hair cut goes, this is among the most thorough cuts I've ever received.  Aside from a solid cut up top, he will always trim my eyebrows AND my nostril hairs.  Yes the latter part sounds disgusting, but he takes care of it for ya (after sanitizing his tools of course before and after).  After all of this, he ends the cut with a straight razor shave with warm shaving cream on the back of the neck and around the edges of the hair line.  If you're looking for a manly place to get your hair cut, skip the hit-or-miss (and sometimes emasculating) chains like Supercuts and head on down to Taylor's Custom Cuts on Butler St. in artsy Lawrenceville!
5	This is the best place in Pittsburgh to get your haircut with the best price. Bob is very thorough  and an all around nice guy
5	My first encounter with Taylor's Custom Cuts was a great one. Bob was courteous, conversational, and detail-oriented. After a quick trim, applications of various tonics, scalp massage, and a straight razor finish, I left feeling like a new man. $12 was a steal for the experience I received. I've found my new place. Totally recommend.
