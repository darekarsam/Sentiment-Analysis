5	This restaurant was near where we were staying in little Italy, and only had a couple of reviews. we loved it, the food was tremendous and the ambience was friendly and comfortable. There is a cheap depanneur across the street if you're in a pinch for a bottle of wine. We had a nice green salad with tomatoes and salted fish as a starter, and sampled both a red snapper entree and a lamb dish. Both were delicious. The service was a little slow, but for a small kitchen they plated things well and as quickly as humanly possible for their staff. Looks like they have a formidable Sunday brunch as well, we might return before the trip is over...
