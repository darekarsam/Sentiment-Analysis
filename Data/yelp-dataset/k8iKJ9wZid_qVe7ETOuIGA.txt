5	A co-worker referred me to Beall's to get a competing bid after another contractor orally quoted me a bid of $3,800 to $4,900 depending on how we wanted to fix the problem.  I called Beall's and they diagnosed and repaired the problem for the cost of a camera down the line ($215) and $142.23.  Put another way, they saved Christmas by saving us more than $3,400.  Based on this experience, I am comfortable abandoning my three bid requirement for all home repairs when it comes to plumbing issues and will start and end with a call to Beall.
5	I noticed some leaking from our water heater on the afternoon of 3/21/14.  I called and Kevin was at our door within the hour.  He then went out to get a replacement heater for us.  Although the price was more than I expected (not unusual when it comes to plumbing I suppose), the speed at which we arrived and his over the top thoroughness was incredible.  I would highly recommend Beall's based on this experience.
