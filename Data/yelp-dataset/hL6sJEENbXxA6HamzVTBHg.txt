3	Neighborhood grocery store. Good prices on beer, great cheese selection, great wine selection and awesome deli. Horrible meat dept and quality of meats.
4	We go here pretty much every day, and the staff is really friendly and helpful.  Prices are lower than Harris Teeter, but higher than BiLo.  Selection is good for everyday ingredients, but you won't find some of the more esoteric ethnic items here.  The meat selection isn't as extensive as Bloom or Harris Teeter, but there are usually better deals here.
3	Very clean store. Staff could be a little more friendly. They are very chatty with each other and I get the "blank stare" if I ask a question because I interrupted their conversation (after waiting 5 mins for them to finish it up). Sale prices are great! Regular prices, not so much. If you shop from their weekly ad, you can save a ton of money. Be careful when buying food from the deli. We bought mac and cheese and found hair in it. They were great about the refund though. All in all, it's a nice store.
