5	Good job, good attitude, good customer service,  they don't sit and talk their language and laugh around customers.  They made me feel so welcomed . I will definitely come back
5	Needed a last minute mani 530 on a Sunday, and despite closing at 6, Myloan still took me no problem. Another girl walked in right at 6 asking for a pedicure, and she was happy to take her as well! Very thankful for her. I will be back :)
2	I was drawn to Nails@ because of the great designs and gel art I saw on yelp. However, I was very dissatisfied with the service I received. I got a gel manicure and a regular pedicure. I originally had a teal polish before I came into the salon, but the lady did not completely take off all of the polish. On the sides of my nails, you can see teal specks next to the coral polish that I chose. My manicure was not painted close to the cuticle, so it looked like I already had a week of nail growth. Also, my gel polish chipped only after two days. I definitely don't think the gel is worth it if it doesn't even last one full week. The application of the gel polish was uneven and very thick. My pedicure was decent, but it was nothing to rave about. Not much time was taken and it was okay. The only thing I liked was the variety of polish colors. I guess my search for a new nail salon in Vegas will have to continue!
