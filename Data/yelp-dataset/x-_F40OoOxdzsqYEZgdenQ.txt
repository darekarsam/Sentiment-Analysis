5	In the 2.5 yrs that I have lived in the Phoenix area, I've had trouble finding an eyebrow expert who would not butcher my eyebrows. They were always too thin or just completely wrong. So I decided to try out this listing I found on Yelp. She is INCREDIBLY good and fast! She did my brows and upper lip in about 15 minutes and my face wasn't swollen afterward. I'm very happy and I hope that more people can give her a chance. On top of that, she is very sweet and has a pretty open schedule. Go see Leena!
5	Amazing woman with amazing talents! Her eyebrow work and shape is phenomenal and her henna tattoos are gorgeous beyond compare! Leena will definitely take care of you at a reasonable price! Thanks again Leena :)
5	She works out of her home.  Threading room has a separate entry way. She is very nice and welcoming. Call to schedule appointment.
