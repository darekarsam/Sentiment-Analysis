4	I'm the kind of person who freaks out even THINKING of someone popping my neck or back.  But I also have a bad back, so a few times a year I find myself at the Chiropractor.  And I'm so happy I found Dr. Wright!!I've been to a couple other Chiropractors who didn't understand (or care) how scared I am of having my bones crack and make loud scary noises.  (I guess I've seen too many of those action flicks where someone just walks up to another person and SNAP, breaks their neck!!!) But when I told Dr. Wright how freaked out all that snapping and popping makes me, he was really cool about it.  For the first few visits he didn't do any kind of popping at all.  He used tools instead, and after I finally felt comfortable with him, he eased me into an actual good old-fashioned adjustment.  And he was so gentle about it and sensitive to my fear, before I knew it, it as over and I was feeling GREAT!!I wish I didn't have to go to a Chiropractor, but when I do.... Dr. Wright is the man!  If you're a chicken like me, but need your back fixed ... give him a visit!
5	Could not be more pleased with the service I got from Dr. Wright and his staff. I had never been to a chiropractor before. I went to Dr. Wright's office as a drop-in with intractable back pain. I went for several sessions and was amazed at the difference. Dr. Wright could not be nicer or more caring.
5	Fantastic chiropractor.  Staff was just as good as he is. Tracy was extremely nice at setting the appointments and Dr Wright was very personable. The entire experience was great and I look forward to having a chiro again.
