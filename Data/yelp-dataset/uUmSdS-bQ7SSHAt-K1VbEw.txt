4	The four stars is for the education. For the price, I would say 2 stars. It's expensive to go here. However, I did feel that I received a top notch education for my paralegal associate degree program. I graduated in October 2008, attended from January of 2007-Oct 2008. All my teachers were more than knowledgable on the subject they were teaching. Very helpful and had good insight as to how what they were teaching really applies in the field. All my law teachers were either seasoned lawyers or judges. Lots of gray areas in law, so having someone teach you what's in the book, plus how it really happens in real life is priceless.
1	I would never recommend this "school" to anyone. The teachers are rude and unprofessional. They don't want their students to succeed. All of these teachers are the ones fired from other schools. This is no the nursing program, but I'm sure the whole school is like this. Go to a real school like asu, gcu, or the community college. This will be a waste of your time and money; two things I don't like to waste. The education is very poor. After graduating from ASU and paying a fraction of the cost it is a much better education.
1	Small Business BEWARE!  Do not ever conduct business with this organization.  After putting you through a mile of paperwork, you will never get paid.  This is the most unprofessional organization I have ever had to deal with.  They will not return emails, phone call, letters or even have the courtesy to answer the phone.  They will take your product however....and never pay for it.
