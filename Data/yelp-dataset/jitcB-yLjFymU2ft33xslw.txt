5	Killer customer service and outstanding prices! Would definitely recommend this place for all your vaping needs!
5	Cameron and Tommy are a class act. They are very professional and attentive. I highly recommend Mr Vape to anyone who wants quality and great pricing.
5	This is a great little vape shop!  They make their own drip tips and they're like no others, they even make wide bore drip caps for some atty's.  Their made-in-house juice is also high quality, max vg if you like, tasty stuff in a wide variety of flavors. And last but not least, they've got clones AND authentic mods for sale.  I'd refer anyone to at least stop by sometime and if it's not close- it's definitely worth a trip!
5	Best juice in the state. Of the dozens of brands I have tried this store definitely has the best
5	Tight little shop. With a very knowledgable staff. The juice is really good. My favorite is the tfk with max vg
