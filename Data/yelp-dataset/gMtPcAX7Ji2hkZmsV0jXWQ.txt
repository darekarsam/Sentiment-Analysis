5	They picked up where both my internet provider and the net Hurd failed. Thank you for being thourgh
5	Amazing find!  I have been searching for a headset that will allow me to switch between pc speaker and headset without having to open control panel and change settings.  In this process, I have engaged in futile conversations with electronics staff at various retail stores.  I telephoned White Rabbit and explained my situation to Angel.  She immediately understood and provided a "pro bono" recommendation.  She did not require a home visit or ask for my credit card to answer my question.  She was polite, professional and not in the least condescending.  Thanks, White Rabbit!
5	A hidden Diamond! This service is amazing. Veteran techs that come to you. You don't have to worry about how far away they are located... they are located at your door step!. They just want to make sure you're happy. I'm never going to the nerd-herd again! Very personable and friendly. Thanks WRT!
