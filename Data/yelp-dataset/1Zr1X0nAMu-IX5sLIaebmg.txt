5	I'm not a fan of makeup at all but I do admit that it does make you look more polished for interviews. Anyway, I do not know squat about makeup and I was helped by Talia. She was very patient, helpful and delightful!! I highly recommend her...she is very good at choosing makeup that complements you.
5	This is my favorite MAC location, great and attentive staff, and of course I don't really think I need to grade the product, as the world already knows that its awesome.Von.. Vaughn, you are a DIVA and I LOVE IT!Awesome work!
5	I always get my make-up done at MAC when I have to anchor on the news desk. The one at Galleria is the closest to our station. I love the friendliness of the staff especially Katrina. She chose the perfect make-up for me (professional yet stunning) - especially the hot red lipstick to match my red outfit. I really appreciated her attention to detail and felt gorgeous! I definitely recommend her and I plan to go to her again when I'm on the news desk in December.
5	It was my first time getting my makeup done at Mac at the galleria mall. And one of their employee named Katrina, was very helpful. She helped me find the right makeup for myself. I've been to other Mac locations and I've gotten bad service. I was there to purchase new makeup to add to my makeup collection. She put the mirror in my hand and explained to me where to place the product in the right place, which impressed me very much. Mac is very fortunate to have her as an artist for their company. I will be returning to the Mac galleria location to see Katrina, and I would recommend other people to request her for an artist at the Mac galleria mall. Thank you Katrina for doing an awesome job on my makeup! I will be coming back to see you to get new brushes.
