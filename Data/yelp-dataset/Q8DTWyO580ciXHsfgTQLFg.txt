5	Have always had excellent service from the crew here.  Been going to this store for nearly five years now and have not been disappointed.
1	One, it is a GameStop.  The layout is pretty good for a GameStop.  It isn't too big or too small.  The reason I will mark them down, though, is the management at this store will flat out lie to make a sale. I understand that having an excessive number of Xbox Ones does not help the bottom line, but it is disingenuous to say that the games like Watch_Dogs, Battlefield 4, etc perform equally on the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One.  That is flat out lying to the customers.  When Digital Foundry, Lens of Truth, Gamespot, etc point out the differences, this should notify the customer never to do business with this store again.
4	It is a GameStop,  and it has a large selection of games.  I give it four stars for that.  However, this is a business, and they want to make a sale.  Research any purchase prior to coming in because they do not take returns on opened products.  That is where Amazon has them beat.  However, sales tax is lower at this Gamestop than it is on preorders from Amazon, and you do not have to pay for shipping.  (cost of prime/# of orders) or (cost of shipping) gives you the convenience increase over just buying from retail.
