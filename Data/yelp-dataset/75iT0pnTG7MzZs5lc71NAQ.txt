5	Very professional,  punctual and fair pricing.
5	I have used Valleywide Appliances for several years as my go-to source for appliance repair and replacement.  I own several vacation rentals around town and  when any of the appliances in my properties are not working, I call Valleywide Appliances.  I have purchased appliances from them as well as had them do repair work.  I like using this company because I have found that if I don't need to replace my appliance, they will not tell me that I do just to sell me a new one. The owner (Andy) is very knowledgeable, honest and professional. I would highly recommend this company and plan to continue using them! :)
4	If you're in the market for an appliance, call Andy at Valleywide before you hit the stores.  He sells, installs and services.  We bought a washer from him in August, 2014.  He got it to us quickly and installed it right away.  A few months later, the hose connecting the machine to the intake started leaking.  He came over within 48 hours and repaired the line at no cost.  I will call Valleywide Appliance for my mext appliance purchase.
