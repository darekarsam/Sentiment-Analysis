5	These guys are able to diagnose the check engine lights and give you solutions to the problems your car may have.  They have always had the parts I needed and the staff has been courteous and knowledgeable regarding the issues I have had. They offer a lot of free services from battery installations, testing alternators to even windshield wiper installations.They just helped me fix my dreaded check engine light at a fraction of the costs of other places.
4	I stopped in here last week and had such friendly & helpful service.  Next time I need an automotive car part, this place will be my first stop.
5	After my car had trouble starting I was 90% sure it was a dead battery but needed to check to make sure it wasn't a fuse going out or a bad alternator.I stopped by this store and had them run a battery check. Despite having a charge, it read as a bad battery. Just to make sure, the technician ran an alternator check as well which passed.However, one of the other technicians thought it was weird that my battery could fail and they were even able to do an alternator check. Apparently the only way to get to the alternator check on the computer system is to have the battery pass.Before I was rung up, they did a second check just to make sure it was the battery. This time it definitely was as I had a rapidly dropping charge.It only took a few extra minutes to conduct the second check but they wanted to make sure they were selling me the right parts.I am perfectly capable of changing a battery but because I was in my work clothes, they offered to change the battery out for my at no extra charge and since they had the tools already handy, I let them.From top to bottom it was fantastic customer service and I'd come back for other auto needs, especially since they were diligent in making sure I had the right parts.
