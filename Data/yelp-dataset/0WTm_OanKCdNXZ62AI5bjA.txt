5	I have been going here now for about 6 weeks, trying to deal with some pain in my shoulder.  But they have started with saying we will get to the route of this problem, and we will go about it one step at a time, if one thing doesnt work we will try something else!  Yeah.  They have an Nurse Prac on staff, they have a Physical Therapist, you can get chriopractic if needed.  There can do X-Rays, Ultra Sound, take blood work, alergy testing, its really like one stop shopping.  I love Sim, shes the nurse prac I see, Carlos is my Physical Therapist, or as I like to call him, my physical Torturist!:)  These guys are Great, the whole practist is wonderful
5	Awesome practice, they do everything, chiropractic, pt, blood work, xrays. I am feeling much better than with my previous chiropractor. They give you a plan of treatment and follow up regularly. Awesome group!!!
5	I really appreciate the care and pain relief I receive from the Pain Stop in Avondale! Best pain relievers around!
