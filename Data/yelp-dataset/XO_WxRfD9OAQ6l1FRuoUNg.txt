5	Best glazed donuts - old school style.
4	I went in there on a whim, and boy was I delighted!I recently moved to this area and can stop in between bus transfers to grab a box of donuts on my way to work.  The Blue Bonnet cake donuts were raved about by my coworkers, so much so that I was given money to get more of them that same week!  Good price for good donuts.Also, the folks that work there are really friendly.
2	Decided to check this bakery out this past weekend and was less than impressed. Upon entering the store I was expecting to be welcomed and asked to be helped. Instead there were four ladies behind the counter staring blankly at my girlfriend and I. So, we both said hello and I gave them a lead in saying that we have never been to their bakery. Was sort of expecting one of the ladies to take the reins and make some suggestions or ask us what we are interested in or possibly even offer us a sample. Nope, instead they didn't get the hint. Eventually, we got one of them to work with us. We asked a few questions about if any of the cookies were soft, and were given us less than impressed, blah answer of no. Then we saw a little chocolate cake and asked if was like a Ho-Ho (which is what they sort of looked like) and was told that it was not like a Ho-Ho. We ended up getting a raspberry tart cookie, raisin cookie, and two of the little chocolate cakes. Price was good at less than $3 for all four items. The chocolate cakes tasted pretty similar to Ho-Hos...The raisin cookie was hard and gross. I immediately spit it out and gave the rest to our dog. The other cookie was OK. I've heard the doughnuts are good, so I'd probably be willing to give this place another shot, so long as I got something different.
