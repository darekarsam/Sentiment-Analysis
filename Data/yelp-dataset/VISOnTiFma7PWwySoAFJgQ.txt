4	Update: Name seems changed. No idea whether it's new management and new menu.-----------------------------Have some layers to take off because this restaurant is hot, temperature-wise. Portions are extremely generous and prices very reasonable. The service is OK, though one is well advised to check the wait staff actually note down the detail of what you said. (e.g.: I want the sake hot, please. Yup, hot.)Osaka is a very unpretentious place which prides itself in serving you good food at a good price. And for that they earn some four well-deserved stars.
5	I love the sushi and food at this place.  The owners were from Japan.  I've been told that the place has been sold.  I hope that the service and food quality remain high.I was always grateful that the waitress came around and offered us samples of food to try at no expense.   I miss this place.
4	Love the food.  This restaurant is actually owned by Japanese folks, which is rare here in Montreal. The food is of the highest quality and the prices are highly reasonable. The service is a little slow but worth the wait. Reservations are an absolute must on weekends. You will NOT be able to just show up. Don't be put off by the shabby chic appearance this place really is a winner.
5	The name wasn't the same but the sushi were amazing and bigWill be back
4	The restaurant name is no longer "Osaka", it's called Fumitomi or something. Regardless, the food was very good. Prices are reasonable but not cheap, however the sushi pieces were immense, so a good value overall.Waitresses were attentive but a bit scattered (mainly due to them being actual Japanese).Sake was hot as hell and came in at about 23$ a bottle (1L)Ambiance is bleh.If you are looking for great sushi that is big and tasty, this is the place. Bring some friends and go chow down.If your looking for fancy sushi to impress your woman and get dressed up, this ain't the place.
