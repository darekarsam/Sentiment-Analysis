5	Although technically a coffee shop, this is also a wonderful Chilean restaurant; with a large selection of coffee creations (the Mexican hot chocolate is perfect).  My favorite, however, has to be the empanadas, made in the Chilean style with ground beef and black olives and served with house made pico de gallo.
5	Cozy alternative to the mainstream mass volume coffee option - with wifi  :)
5	Excellent... They are going to a vegitarian menu to attract more people. The service is wonderful, atmosphere is outstanding and the food is to die for... Must go
