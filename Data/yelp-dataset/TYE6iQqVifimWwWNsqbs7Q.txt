2	I'm pissed that Dish has chosen to remove the Sundance Channel from their content.  It's hard enough to get any decent programming for cable or satellite providers.  90% of the content they put out is completely useless to a majority of the population.  I sure as hell don't need 8 shopping channels.  My contract is up in a few months.  I know I'm like a lot a folks in that getting closer and closer to getting all of my content through the internet.  The only thing I would miss from cable or satellite would be live sports.  Netflix, YouTube are awesome.  Those two source alone can nearly replace Dish TV for my taste.  Who's with me?
1	Totally agree with Keeley's review, I got the same treatment while trying to get a simple answer about pricing.  It's not the rep's fault, they are taught this bullshit tactic by upper upper management to try and confuse the potential customer into giving up all hope of a clear answer and just giving up their credit card.   It's called "Perceived value" - starting high and discounting it back down to normal prices making it look like you're getting a huge discount.My story is just as long as Keeley's and even gets worse, I tried calling 5 different times and talked to 5 different people before giving up myself....and going with Directv.  NOTE: This review doesn't reflect my experience with this specific Dish Network provider or installer, just the company in general.  Dish has gotten such horrific reviews that they cleverly disguised their corporate Yelp profile in a sea of "authorized dealer" profiles so we can't review them directly.
