5	Need junk removed? I'm happy with the choice I made. Called Mike and he gave me a great price/quote. I mentioned that I wanted this job completed early this morning. He sent a text stating he was on his way. Junk was removed. Great service. I highly recommend this business. Ask for Mike - 480-233-2131.

He is extremely pleasant and a hard working individual. His pricing  is very reasonable and he is more than willing to come out for an estimate. I highly recommend him.
