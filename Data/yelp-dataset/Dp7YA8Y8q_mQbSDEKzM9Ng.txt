5	Great customer service.
4	I have been with UW credit union for a very long time.  I started my account in Milwaukee, moved to Madison because of a job, then moved across the country and back because of a job.  I have had some minor trouble with them in the past, but they have always been very helpful.  Their staff are willing to go above and beyond for their members.
