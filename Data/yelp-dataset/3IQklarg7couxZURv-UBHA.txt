1	Yuck food is greasy service stunk! I ordered a Philly sand which to find out they were out! Ordered French onion soup was way too salty. Mozzarella sticks ok but defiantly greasy! Waited 20 minutes for our check as we were told our server was busy. Needs a good cleaning also
3	A guilty pleasure of mine.I go here for my cheap burger fix, that occasional craving your get when your stomach wants anything BUT "gourmet" or "fancy".It does the trick.No frills, no thrills, and the bathrooms are pretty scary, but I still find myself here every so often to munch down the 'classic'. *shrug*
