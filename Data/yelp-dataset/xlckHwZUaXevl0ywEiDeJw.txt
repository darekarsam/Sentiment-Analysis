2	Velomakak is a very unique place in Montreal...yes, they have the most extensive selection of parts, old bikes, pieces of bikes, horns, seats, posts, frames...you name it...So you can find some pretty awesome stuff here. The problem is, there is no price on anything. And when you find someone to ask the price, you get some random number that is not all that low, with a smirk. You feel like negotiating, but they generally don't seem to like that. You can't escape the fact that the people running this place have a big attitude and they definitely don't give a hoot about customer service. I get the sense they don't like Anglophones, but maybe that's just me projecting some insecurity...either way, it doesn't feel comfortable shopping here. We were told the cost of repairs would be ... eh, $35, not more than $40, and then the "bill" was $65...what do you do then? Well, negotiate? I don't know...we wound up paying near what they asked...but the whole experience really left a bad taste in our mouths...despite the quality workmanship.
5	some of the nicest people to do business with when shopping for bike parts (new and used) in montreal and the big dog that lives in the shop is very friendly too ;) .... its messy but you leave with what you need at a very affordable price. merci
