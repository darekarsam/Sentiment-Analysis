5	Great prices, very nice eLiquid's and better staff. Glad i don't have to drive 13 miles anymore for my vape needs.
5	I originally wrote a pretty bad review but after going back a few times they have turned around for the better. They have improved greatly since they were new and show honest, practical traits. They don't seem like they are after your wallet any more and give great advice. The prices are reasonable and it is generally a great atmosphere the second you walk in. I definitely recommend visiting this shop for your vape needs.
1	I had the most worthless experience with these guys. I bought a big bottle of juice thinking it was a different flavor. My mistake but this guy wouldn't swap it out. That's a lot of expensive juice to choke down. I was one of their first customers and spent another 50 bucks during this visit alone. Not to mention the hundreds spent prior to today. Too bad. I was glad to see a decent vape store so close to home. I'll drive a little further to get better service. Bad customer service is a big reason businesses fail here in Buckeye.
