1	How do you leave no stars?I feel like I have to leave a review so that people don't waste their time at this store. We went there twice and experienced the worst customer service. We left the first time because no one would even help us. It took 30 minutes for someone in the store to address us. We were told that we needed to schedule an appointment with Sherry. We called twice to do so and never received a call back. So we just went in there a second time and talked to Sherry. She was literally so rude and just laughed three different times at me. I was being so nice! She just laughed and looked at me. I am still so confused with our conversation. Oh, I wanted to yell at her but I am more civilized than her. I asked an employee to speak to a manager and he said the manager wasn't there and didn't even ask if he could help. We just left. Anyways...I feel like I am ranting so I won't share the whole story. Please don't go there and give them business. Especially Sherry, seriously she is the worst. She laughed at a customer who wanted to give her money! I included a pic of me and my daughter who was with me.  I hope Sherry reads this review and knows who wrote it.
