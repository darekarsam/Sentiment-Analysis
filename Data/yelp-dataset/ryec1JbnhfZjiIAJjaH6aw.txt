3	Auntie Anne's is one of a few eateries in the Excalibur's food court. On the way from Paris to Mandalay Bay, we dropped by here for a pretzel. As far as the snack places in the Excalibur food court, Auntie Ann's might be the least unhealthy (and tasty).   I enjoyed the pretzel. It was tasty yet slightly greesy.
5	EEEK! Love this place!!
