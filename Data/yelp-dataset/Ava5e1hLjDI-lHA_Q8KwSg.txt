5	I'm from the Bay Area, California and we have some of the best sushi places around...so I thought, "good sushi in Montreal??? RIIIIIIGHHHT." I guess I answered my own question because this place was awesome! - Great corner location that looks out a street for good people watching. - Friendly owner/chef with staff that provided sick service.- Fresh food and very fair prices. Be sure to try the sushi pizza! Sounds wierd I know but it was real good. Be sure to make this one of your stops. You don't need any other sushi places in Montreal with Akiko around.
2	The sushi pizza was okay, but all three rolls tasted like cucumber and rice...bland.  Expensive for such quality and small portions.
5	Just had some amazing sushis from this place.. we had the chefs special with 20 pieces and some tokyo ones..  loved everything from the environment, the staff to the food. And was really delighted by the low sodium soy sauce. Highly recommended :)
5	This place is great!! The only good bring your own wine I found in Montreal. I used to get delivery nearly 3 times a week and I moved to Miami.. I miss their tartare rolled in rice paper and lettuce.. I think it's called Gucci .. I can't find anything similar to it anywhere. I miss this place.. I for sure am going to stop by during my next trip to Montreal.
4	Great place for sushi if you're not opting for an all you can eat gluttony fest at Kanda's. Came here today to order to-go and went a little crazy at first. It came out to 62$ for two people and we decided to instead go for the "chef's special" which was 20 pieces for 18$. On top of that we ordered tempura and tofu. The tofu was really bad and I'd never order it again. The tempura was delicate and great but a very small portion.The sushi was phenomenal! Can't really tell you what was all in there but it was just great. Every piece was made with care and bursting with flavour. While I'm living in Cote des Neiges i'll be coming here for sushi!
