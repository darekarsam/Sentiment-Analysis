5	I am totally hooked!! I have had the best experience and results with CIT.  Roe Fuller is very professional and knowledgable.  Roe also made me feel very comfortable about doing CIT. I'm in my forties and had many sun spot and noticed my skin aging, after my first treatment coworkers and friends noticed right away. I get compliments on my skin a lot now. I'm really glad I did it! Roe is awesome! I highly recommend!
5	I have been thinking about having permanent make-up done for some time.  I heard about Roe and that she is extremely professional and talented at what she does, and so I decided to finally move forward with permanent brow and lip lining.  I'm so glad I went to Roe!  I couldn't be happier with the results!  She listened to what I  wanted, answered all my questions and concerns, and offered her expert opinion and skills to accomplish what I was hoping to achieve...and more!I have highly recommended seeing Roe to all my friends and family.  She's the best!
5	Roe Fuller is a knowledgable technician with alot of experience in CIT  Treatments and Permanent Makeup. I have seen her Permanent Makeup work and it looks fantastic! However, I have actually had CIT treatments done by Roe and the experience and results have been phenomenal. I wouldn't go to anyone else.
5	I had heard about CIT and wanted to try it, but was scared of the pain.  My friends finally convinced me to give it a try and I couldn't be happier.  Roe quickly put me at ease explaining everything before during and after.   The results are great!  My husband says I look 10 years younger.   It was as relaxing as having a massage- with results you can see.  Roe is so professional and really caring.  You are in good hands with this woman!
