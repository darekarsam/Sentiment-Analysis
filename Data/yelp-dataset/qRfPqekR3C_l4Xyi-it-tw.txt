5	Super cute, quick & high quality gel! Clean salon & LaKisha is very kind & professional! Highly recommend! She even has a manicure punch card, so after several visits, you get one free!
5	Lekisha is very professional and love how she focuses on natural nails! She takes her time and perfects my nails and of course always has good conversation!
5	My nails were a mess after having worn acrylics for over 10 years. I'm now going natural and my nails look better than ever! Lekisha is using the IBX system to strengthen my nails. They no longer crack and chip and are actually growing! She's awesome!
5	LeKisha was great! Her salon was very clean as were all the tools she used.  I've recently taken off acrylic nails, which I've worn for years. I got a gel manicure this time. My nails look great, you can't even tell my nails were damaged from the acrylics. She did a wonderful job and I will definitely be going back!
5	I had a great experience! Lekisha is very gentle on nails and knows the right suggestions for nail colors :) I tried the gel manicure with some cute sparkly accents. I highly recommend this place!
5	Just went here for the 1st time. LeKisha was great. The salon is very clean and it is very quiet. She took her time and was very friendly and a pleasure to work with. There are not smelly chemicals, as she uses all Gel. She takes her time and is a perfectionist. Call ahead she books up quick!
