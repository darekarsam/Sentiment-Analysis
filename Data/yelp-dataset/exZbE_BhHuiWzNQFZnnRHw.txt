3	I wouldn't review a Walgreens if only for the fact to let you know that this is not a 24hr location. The nearest is at Dobson & Warner and they also have a Redbox. This one does, but again they are only open until 10 pm.
3	They sell the Big Flats brand beer for only $3.33/6 pk.  And they are close.  That's about all I need to know.   I just moved here part time and will probably stop by once or twice a month.  Beyond that they have most of the other common drugstore products.  You have to sign up for their rewards card if you want to get the sale prices, tho.
5	Feeling good about the explanation, Faranak the pharmacist, gave me about the trip to ER today.  First, let me back up.  My mother woke with a swollen and sore knee this morning that rated a 9 on the pain chart.  Off to the hospital to find some answers.  Spent hours waiting, having a CT scan, waiting, getting x-rays ... They said no explanation other than inflammation.  Pain pills, walker, and booted out the door.  Now, back to Faranak at Walgreens.  She took the time to explain the "why" to the different tests, and old me what they were looking for.  She also told me what I should continue to be on the eye out for.  Thanks for going the extra mile.
