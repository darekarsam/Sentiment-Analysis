5	"I just want an honest mechanic." That is the phrase you most commonly hear people say when their car is giving them trouble. Well, you found him, and his name is Rich. He has made my car like new and was honest and fair. We will be driving down from Phoenix to bring our car to Rich, it is worth the drive. He will put all mechanics in Casa Grande out of business once word starts spreading of his great service.
5	Highly recommend as my father and I have been using Richard for years! Totally honest, reliable, dependable work.
1	Terrible services. Never take your vehicle here. I took my car in because it was overheating. 900 dollars later, he claimed it was fixed. I picked the car up drove a block down the road and it was still overheating. I called him and he said "he didn't know what to tell me." If you want to be robbed of your money take your vehicle to Rich's, otherwise, find another mechanic!
