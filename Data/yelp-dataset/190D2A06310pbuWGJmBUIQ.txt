4	This is a handy Rite Aid, located next to Southpark mall. The parking lot has lots of spaces close to the entrance, and the store is large and pretty well maintained. I frequent this one a lot and end up getting lots of weird stuff, I never feel judged and the staff are friendly.
3	A very useful Rite Aid since there aren't many stand alone pharmacies in the SouthPark area. It's one of the way out outparcels of the Mall.Full service pharmacy but also personal care, photos, medicines and snacks. Not easy to access from eastbound Fairview.
5	I used to be a CVS-only girl, until I started going to Rite-Aids. I like this one because it is close to my house, has a parking lot that is easy to get in and out of, it is clean inside, and the man who works here is really friendly
2	The store itself is great.  The Pharmacy on the other hand is terrible.  They have the worst customer service.  Don't try to call and ask a question.  You'll be put on hold for a VERY long time.  Sometimes they just pick the phone up and place it directly on hold without acknowledging you.  I'm switching.
