5	Carpets brokers is great. We have used them in our property management department and for our own rental homes.  They always are timely and a very competitive with their pricing.  We have always been very happy.

The first time I went there I was helped by the owner, and he was extremely helpful.  He let me take some samples home and gave me information on many different types of hard surfaces.  The next couple of times I went there, it was hard to even find someone to help me. Another time I went there and they weren't open when they were supposed to be.   I think one of the gals was late to work that day.  All in all, I did get some good information, but their prices were just a bit too high for me.
