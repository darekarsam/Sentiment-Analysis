5	We had a great first experience! It was during taste MTL, a week long festival showcasing montreal's great restaurants, and Baxo did not disappoint! Duck confit poutine, wild mushroom risotto, the tartar and rabbit were amazing! Great comfort food, fun staff who add to the cozy experience. Definitely a restaurant to try! Nice drink selection, too :)
5	Great restaurant located in scenic old Montreal.  A must if you are looking for imaginative cuisine made from local products.  For me, it was a new twist on French Canadian cuisine.  I had flank steak served with poutine (gourmet style).  I enjoyed some tasty Canadian beer too.  They also have a great wine selection and a comprehensive menu with a variety of meat, poultry, and fish options.  A must....check it out!
1	This restaurant was the ABSOLUTE WORST! HENCE MY COMMENT FOR SOME CLOSURE ON THIS TERRIBLE RESAURANT.If zero stars were an option I would leave nothing. I ordered the Capon for 2 and got this very well presented dish however the actual bird was horrible. So much salt I thought I was going to have a stroke. I brought it home for my dog, I couldn't believe MY DOG LICKED IT ONCE AND DID NOT TOUCH IT FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT!!!! LOLThe service was so terrible I thought we should walk. The least management could have done was taken the terrible food off of our bills, nope NOTHING  was done!Stay away from this place or assume the consequences of memories that will forever haunt you, every time I think of this place I am annoyed at the fact that I actually handed them my credit card to pay for this meal. I would hope for an apology or a complimentary something...I will update you if management takes any decisions via YELP to save their reputation!
