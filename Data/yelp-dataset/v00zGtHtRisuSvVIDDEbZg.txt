5	I just recently had wave front lasik with Dr. Drew Hiatt and was so pleased with his bedside manner, along with all the extra steps his whole entire staff took at the Swagel Wooten Center to care for me.    Dr. Hiatt has gone above and beyond to help me get the best care possible and has taken the time to check on me over the weekend, on his own time.  I can not say enough about the staff or Dr.Hiatt and would highly recommend this clinic and him.  Thank you
5	Great people to work with! I had Doctor Harion who is a Cornea Specialist. He is EXTREMELY thorough and handles you as a patient the way you would expect from an old country doctor and he cares. I have sent 2 patients to him and bringing my dad with me tomorrow. Dr Harion is ACES!!! I also want to add that Swagel Wootton Hiatt Eye Center doctors always give your eyes a great examination no matter who you go see. Office is clean and nice, never a long wait and easy to get appointments, nice office staff. I would rate this practice an A!
