5	I love hotel lobby bars, and this one is the BEST! It's at the base of the ultra-swanky Wynn Tower Suites, which is the swanky VIP enclave within the already swanky Wynn hotel. But anyone can sit here and have a drink.The drinks and ambiance are fantastic, but it's really the people-watching that makes this place. Expect tons of one-percenters, high-end hookers, nouveau-riche sports figures and assorted other white trash celebrities. Last time I was there, Pele (the soccer player) and some chick from Pawn Stars passed through.  As these fine people get drunker, however, things can get delightfully awkward. I watched a swaggering redneck songwriter in a sport jacket and ball cap (!) needle the shit out of some poor black attorney, repeatedly calling him "Sidney Poitier" as the bartender guffawed politely, tapdancing madly on the line between offending either party. Awkward as fuck, but fun to watch in a really sick way!And THAT's what I love about this place.
1	Don't come here if you value your lungs.  You can light up anywhere.  We moved multiple times and could not get away from smoke.  The ventilation is not good enough for the smoking that goes on.  Wynn offers a Vegan menu everywhere, but doesn't care about your lung health.
4	My girlfriends and I wanted to get a quick drink before capping off the night and saw this place near our hotel elevators. Very convenient and cool location near the right back end of the casino area. Our drinks were delicious and prepared perfectly. This bar is right across of the restaurant red 8. Very nice upscale decor and great location to people watch as well.
