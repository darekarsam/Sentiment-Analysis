2	We ended up leaving Arrowhead after about 3 years. My daughter is extremely afraid of the dentist. Despite her history, they would refuse to let me go back with her until she was already freaking out. THEN they would let me come back. On top of that, I was made to feel like there was a problem with my parenting skills because of her anxiety. We switched to a new dentist who doesn't have a problem letting parents stay with their kids-her first visit went extremely well.
1	The customer service client care and follow-up of this dentist is among the worst I have come across.Did you not follow up they do not keep parents informed they are rude and unhelpful.
5	Love this dentist.  My daughter has been going here since she was 2 and loves going. They are very professional and kid friendly.
