4	This is probably the best place in Charlotte to shop for jeans.  The best thing about the Poole Shop is that even though it seems like it could one of typical snobby stores where everything is ridiculously expensive and the sales staff is rude, it totally isn't.  They do have ridiculously expensive jeans (pretty much any brand or style you could want) but they also sell some really affordable brands so you can get a pair for under $100.  The sales staff here is helpful, but they will tell you that you look great in everything you try on (even if maybe you don't).
4	For casual ware this place is second to none.  They have a wide variety of comfy stuff and cute dresses.  But the real draw is the jeans, there is a bunch of stuff to choose from in this department.  The only down side is that it is kind of a small store so the selection isn't the biggest, but they do have an awesome fish tank.
3	The Poole Shop drew me in from the outside by their bold and funky window display, which was nice to see amongst several very expensive and more conservative stores. They do have a nice selection and, while still pricey, you can find great jeans here. The staff didn't even say hello though, and I found them to be a bit snotty. Other than that, it's worth a go.
