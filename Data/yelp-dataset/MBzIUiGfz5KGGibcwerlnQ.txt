4	Every time I walk in the guys here are smiling and will usually jump right in to help me fill up my water bottles. They will even help me load it up if I am by myself. The Ice Cream is great too! It takes me back to when I was a kid & would shop at Thrifty with my grandparents and they would get me a cone if I was good in the store. Great customer service here!
5	My daughter and I have been comming here for years,  and have always been treated well.   I know it just looks like a water store,  but they do have more than just the products they're named for.   For one thing,  they have Thrifty Ice Cream with about 8 or 10 flavors in stock... They also have an almost unlimited amount of flavors of snow cones and a large selection of candy.   The 2 guys that run the place are some truly nice people.   Not only will they help you fill your water, but they always have a smile on their face
4	This is possibly the best. High volume, central location. I have one close to me in Scottsdale butprefer this one. Hard working, excellent attitude.QUALITY!  I went to close location and bought a junkthree gallon container. I was insulted in a number of manners but bought the expensive bottle due to time constraints. On my next trip here I purchased a much higher quality 3 gallon water bottle for considerably less and the man who I guess I have seen for 20? years was pleasant. Pricing average to lower but highest quality.
