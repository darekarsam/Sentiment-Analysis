2	How the heck did I manage to spend over $8 for a grilled chicken burritto and a drink?!  I know.  I WAS RIPPED-OFF!!  How does this chain manage to stay in business?!
2	There was a time that this was a great Qdoba location. Went in today with my family and was overall disgusted with the level.of service & food. The place was a mess. The drink area looked like someone was setting it up and just walked away. An open container of sugar was sitting there with the lid to the sweet tea open as well. The trays that the food are delivered smelled awful. I don't think they have been actually cleaned since the place.opened, most likely just get wiped down by a dirty rag. The food was even tasteless. The only redeeming quality left for me is the chips & queso. Otherwise Chipotle knocks Qdoba to the curb.
4	The Qdoba in maryland was always so quiet. I was quite surprised to see this one so busy! Anxious to try the quesadilla that I ordered!
1	I love Qdoba's but this location is always skimpy on the food and they are not friendly. Such a bad representation of the good restaurant!!
