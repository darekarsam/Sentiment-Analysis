1	I love Kirkland's, but I will never return to this location!  The staff (manager included) was extremely rude!  There were only 2 shoppers in the store and yet we still could not get help from the staff.  They kept looking at us (we had our baby with us) but nobody would help.  Then when they finally figured out we wanted to purchase something the manager was rude and demeaning!  Needless to say we walked out and went to the Desert Ridge location where we were helped and the staff was great!
4	Great prices on items. Great place to add some decor to your home.  Its the little nick nacks that help... We got a great deal on 3 large mirrors here, large almost 6 ft tall and 3 ft wide with nice wood frames.  They are elegant pieces that cost half the price of some furniture stores I shopped at.  If you need some decor for your house or apartment/condo try Kirklands.....
5	I was shopping at Kirklands today, and the cashier made my day! He was funny, witty, and very personable. Not only that, but he saw the coupon I had and knew that the store was offering a better one, and let me use it! He made it a great experience and I got some cute things to decorate for fall! I can't wait! I love the unique things you can buy, and how cheap they are compared to other home good stores!
4	Great place for decorative stuff for your home, but I had to review this place because I found the CHEAPEST huge sofa picture that will cover a huge wall that I have been pushing off since the least expensive large pic was going to run me $300-$400 but I found one here for $130 (yeah, I know...so cheap but it was on sale).  The frame was plastic but it looks just as good as a $800 wood frame that would have made the pic over $1000.  So if you are looking for cool stuff to decorate your home with but do not want to spend fort knox to do so...come here.
