5	For a lonely foreign boy needing a good cry, the vindaloo had me bawling like a baby.  It's been 10 years (1998) since I've been back, but it was a reliable go-to throughout that rainy, gray summer.   It also gave me a little cachet when passing judgment on the subcontinental food out west.  I mean, who's gonna go to South Queensferry, Scotland to challenge my credibility?  Nobody, that's who.
