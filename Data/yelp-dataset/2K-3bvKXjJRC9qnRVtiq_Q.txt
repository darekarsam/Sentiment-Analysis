5	Just got the best razor cut of my life from LaLa at this location. She was friendly, professional...you are in good hands with her. I have spent $50 for haircuts less textured than this and yet soft at the same time...all for 21 bucks tip included!!! LaLa you rock!!!
5	I have been getting my haircut here almost  2 years. The best hair persons I like going too, are Beatrice and Lala! They are both great! They really take their time on cutting your hair.  Thank You Ladies!
1	Teribble service right before  school only 2 ppl cutting hair and they are busy talking saying a two hour wait. Where are the employee's? ppl are walking out. They are loosing business. What a bad business
5	Always a great cut. I have been going there for 10 years or more.  Great people.  If you don't want to wait call ahead and get on the list.
