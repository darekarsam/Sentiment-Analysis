5	We had our child's first portrait session here for the growth panel- a series of photos from pre-sitting, sitting, and first steps.  We're just at the first leg and so far we're really happy. Excellent quality, personal attention,  and I love that this is a local family business, not a chain or corporation. I'll update this as we go along.PS they have really cool bookmarks available with your photo and you can have a name written in on it- it looks really sharp!
5	The best Charlotte photography company to work with. I really enjoy getting to know the company. Jeff  and his team really know how to capture the moment for personal photos to personable family shots.
5	Fastest year of my life! The growth panel is complete and we couldn't be happier. The last session was the most fun. Since our daughter has started experiencing separation anxiety I didn't think we'd get huge laughs and smiles. I was wrong. Jeff and Becky worked really well with her and helped direct me to get the best shots. They had great toys that she responded enthusiastically toward. When I returned for the proof appt it was difficult to pay attention because I had my daughter with me and she was all over the place. Becky walked with her to the next room where they had more toys and I listened to them play... she didn't cry (remember she's been having separation anxiety). She actually had a fun time. They were really nice and patient with us.
