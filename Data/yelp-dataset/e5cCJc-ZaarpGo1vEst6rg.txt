5	Katherine was amazing friendly and helped us pick out a cute outfit for Baby C to have his photo taken in!She has a very organized store and we look forward to returning!  :)
5	Love this store. It is very clean (all clothes are washed and pressed by the owner). A lot of care and thought is given to the merchandise...unlike consignment stores they buy items outright from sellers and take pride in their offerings. They are more than willing to look for items not currently in store for special requests and care about your experience. Highly recommended especially in comparison to some of the other stores I've seen recently in Phx.
