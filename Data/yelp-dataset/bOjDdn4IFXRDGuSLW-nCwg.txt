5	Been around for close to a century, providing its rabid fanbase with the absolute best steamers in Montreal and the world and the absolute best French Fries in Montreal and in the world as well. And that's all they serve in this standing room only dive... An absolute must for Hot Dog stand fans :D
5	This is an amazing hot dog joint.  It's been around for so long offering great steamed hot dogs and fries at great prices.
5	Best steamed hotdogs in Montreal! This place is a real institution. They been around for ages.You gotta try one to understand! Menu consists of nothing but hotdogs, fries and poutine.
5	Best Steamies and fries in the city.  If your in the east end, no reason not to drop in.
5	Great place for a cheap lunch or snack.They serve delicious poutine and hotdogs. With few bucks you can fill up your stomach for rest of your day. Highly recommended. If you pass by on Fleury Street. Take a look. This place is mostly for take out. Only summer time you can sit outside tables. That's the only bad side of this place.
5	Not much more I can add to what all the other reviewers have mentioned already. I love the old school diner feel. Steamed hot-dogs with yummy coleslaw, tasty hot fries & basic mouth watering poutine is all they offer which all they really need to offer. You can stand by the window to eat there or do take-out. 2-3 picnic tables are by the diner in their parking lot or preferably in the summer months order take out & walk west on Fleury one or two blocks to the nearby park & dine on a nice sunny day.
