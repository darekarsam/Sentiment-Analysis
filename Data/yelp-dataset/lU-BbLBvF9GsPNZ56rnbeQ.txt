5	This is the best thing in Urbana. Lois Steinberg is truly world-renowned, and her expertise and penetrating teaching will transform how you do yoga. Other studios have fun classes with music and the chance to do some sun salutations, but this studio will teach serious yoga practitioners or beginners a completely new way to look at yoga. This is appropriate for those with injuries as well as the young and healthy. I cannot recommend this highly enough.
1	Lois was a terrible yoga experience! I am a certified 200 hour yoga instructor. I have never known a worse yoga experience. This is not what yoga is all about. I can't emphasize enough the need to experience yoga in its true flowing, calm, and welcoming fashion and this is not the place. Giving 1 star is giving to much praise Namaste
5	Lois Steinberg is a world class IYENGAR YOGA teacher.  The Iyengar Method is precise and strong - Lois has a keen sense of humor and she weaves yoga philosophy in with the asana classes for a penetrating and deep experience - 100's of people travel from all over the world to study with Lois.  When you are ready to get serious about your yoga practice this is the place to go!!!
5	The yoga classes here are amazing. A great workout and superb instruction.
