4	Very authentic fine Italian cuisine close to the office!
3	It was an okay meal. Nothing spectacular, although I did enjoy the profiteroles and the fireplace!
5	Very fine, authentic Italian dining.  I've had the privilege to dine here twice, both times with business colleagues here in Montreal who are regulars, and I have been impressed with the service and the food both times.  It might be a little bit hard to find if you don't know your way around the area, but if you do find it you won't be disappointed!
1	I attended a reunion at La Serenata and I found this resto is as Italian as the Olive Garden, only much more expensive. We were offered a set menu with selections that, IMHO, were non-Italian. Can anyone tell me if snow-peas and stewed carrots are truly part of Italian cuisine?  I don't think so. They had the nerve to charge an extra $5.00 for rapini because i didn't like the vegetables on the set menu. A plate of tortellini and penne that came on one plate,that's gross in it's self, with a generic bottled rose sauce.I had that replaced with a green salad but it was pretty much tasteless. Now I may be too critical but when you order a grilled fish, should it come looking microwaved and greasy?   Never mind this resto being overpriced I could forgive them for that if the food was at least good, which it wasn't.
