4	This place is a tucked away family owned business that has great service and everything is always fresh. The only bad thing about this place is that it closes early.
5	If you are in the area this is a great hidden delight, The ingredients are the freshest I have had before the "Lettuce, tomatoes, Onions" etc are worth trying even if you do not normally care for them.
5	After hearing about this place from a few coworkers, my friend and I decided to go grab some subs for lunch today. How did i survive so long on my crappy work cafeteria food when this was 2 mins away??? Its great, its a hidden little spot right off of 24th street with amazingly fresh food and speedy service. Not only that, but the cost is super cheap! The mini subs are in the 3 dollar range and are perfect for lunch. We will be back...many, many times.
5	You can't ask for a better lunch time sandwich joint than this place. The staff is friendly, and the food is always awesome. I really Love their salads and wraps, they are huge portions and leave you full, without the heavy feeling. I call my order in and swing by and pick it up. Fast, friendly and reliable.
5	This place is amazing. Some coworkers and I were boycotting our crappy cafeteria food and decided to go out. We did a quick yelp search and decided to come here. It is really tucked away, but we were pleasantly surprised when we found it. It was busy but not packed. We each ordered a different sub and they were all delicious. The bread is awesome and the veggies were fresh. A whole is enormous, so next time we will get minis. Overall we were really impressed and will definitely be back to this great little sub shop.
4	Pretty good sandwich, had a club on wheat sub. Everything tasted fresh and good. Lemonade is good. Price is decent paid 8.50 for sub,chips and drink
