5	By far one of the best massage experiences I've ever had.  Panorama Towers is great in and of itself, but Tina's professionalism and expertise was outstanding.  I am a performer with Cirque du Soleil and have gotten a multitude of massages over the years.  Tina's medical training is evident.  She knew exactly how to pinpoint specific problem areas as well as give a complete overall relaxing massage.  If you are looking for someone who knows their craft and is positive, peaceful, and priced fairly, look no further!
5	Best Massage I've had in years!!!  Tina is the best kept secret in town. If you're staying near City Center or live in Panorama you must have her on speed dial!
5	Tina is awesome! She has been consistently great with my deep tissue massages. She provides a relaxing atmosphere which is appreciated and works well with last minute scheduling. I have referred her to many of my friends and family and they all have loved her!!!
