5	Fantastic gourmet Chinese food. That's as straightforward as it gets. A three-course meal with drink for under $20 CAD that is high-quality, authentic, and yummy. It is very quiet at dinnertime; during the day is their usual rush (according to the owner.)
5	Wow, excellent. Boeuf a l'orange is awesome. Great place.
3	Stopped in for dinner.  I was the only person and the host/waiter was very cordial and helpful.  He said they usually do lunch and deliver for dinner.  Hot and sour soup was ok.  Dark brown broth, pretty thick. Not an over abundance of vegetable or other items.  I had fried spinach as an appetizer.  Its super good.  I have never had it.  It is light and flaky fried spinach sprinkled with sugar and garlic I think.  Made me feel healthy but tasted like candy.  I had General Tao chicken at the waiter insistence.  Large chunks of chicken in a mild spicy / sweet sauce.  It was good, but I would have like some vegetables or pineapple or something to cut the sweet chicken taste.  It was a huge portion and I could only eat half.  Overall ok.  $27.59 plus tip for meal.
5	Best peanut butter dumplings in Montreal. Fried spinach and General Joe Chicken is THE best. Tommy has owned the restaurant for years and the food has always been great! All his chicken is white meat rather than the gamey scraps the restos in Montreal Chinatown use. He gets to know his regular clientele by name and memorize your orders throwing in treats of he likes you, Very generous portions for delivery. Super fast delivery or pickup. Dining room is fine, but usually empty as catering and delivery are his primary businesses. Highly recommended.
