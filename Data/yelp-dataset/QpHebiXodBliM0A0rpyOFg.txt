5	Legacy Moving is AMAZING. Overnight response after my first movers didn't call back to confirm. Sent two great guys, moved me to my condo with no hitches and then pack up a 22 ft. truck for Texas. I would use them again in a heartbeat!!!  THANKS  THANKS  THANKS
5	These guys are without a doubt the best moving company I have ever used. They moved me from my house in 2013 and then to an apartment in July 2014. Both times they were fast, treated all my furniture like it was priceless, and even set up and staged the furniture in each new place. Truly amazing.They are prompt, courteous and incredibly skilled. Hands down the top of the class. If there was a 6 star rating, they would get it!!
4	Good moving company. Moved me like a charm. However they should NOT have their movers asking to be paid for lunch, and they should NOT have their movers asking for more money as a "tip" at the end of the move. You were paid 85.00 per hour and a fuel surcharge and an extra 85.00 travel fee and they were an hour late in arriving. Did a great job moving for which they were paid well in cash. Asking for additional money, even though I paid it under pressure, was unprofessional.
