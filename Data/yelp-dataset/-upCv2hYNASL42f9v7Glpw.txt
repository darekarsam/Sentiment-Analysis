4	One of the better ones I found in a while. Almost everything is very great, everything is just good. We order extra to take home and warn up for lunch the next day.
2	Started out with one of the longest waits I've experienced for something as simple as bourbon chicken. One of the appeals of Chinese food is the quickness with which the order is normally completed. This wasn't the case here. For the lunch special being only 5.95 (including a drink) it could be a good deal - but only if your time isn't valuable. For me, waiting in excess of 20 minutes and still not having the food yet is a bit much.The food was about as good as you'd expect an unimpressive Chinese food place to be. If you've never had truly good Chinese food an are used to a mall food court, it will probably taste acceptable.5.95 for a drink, two semi-okay crab Rangoon and a dish is the draw.
4	Pretty good take out ...not bad one of the better options in the area..I personally like the sesame chicken and there sa cha beef ...also the kung pao
