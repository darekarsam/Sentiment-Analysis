3	This Circle K has some of the best gasoline prices in the area and the convenience store is well stocked.  I come here two or three times a month and the folks behind the counter are always nice.WOW!
3	Again like my other reviews, it's a liqueur store. You can find what you need here. I'll say this, it's a little smaller compared to some of the bigger newer ones throughout the Valley. But it serves it purpose. :)
4	Although this store is smaller, it has some of the friendliest workers I've ever seen. Just make sure that you're not trying to get gas at a busy time of day.
