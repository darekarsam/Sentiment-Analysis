1	This salon is small which usually is a plus.  However they don't clean their tools at all, they push colors on you instead of letting you pick out the color you want.  I got gel polish and they didn't apply it correctly so it peeled off two days later (all 10 nails)!The polish was way too thick, it didn't cure between layers, it was applied messily, my nails weren't prepped before the polish went on and then they didn't clean the surface well before I left so my nails were sticky!The service was slow and way over priced.  For $25 I expect a manicure along with gel polish.  You can't ask if I want a gel MANICURE and not do the manicure part!
2	Friendly staff but as some of the other reviews mentioned, tools don't appear to be sanitized for next customer. This is a shame because otherwise I was satisfied but I would rather pay more for clean /safe conditions. Too bad.
4	Extremely pleased with the service! Everyone who works there is very nice and friendly. Pricing is the best I've found for the quality of manicures and pedicures. The photo of my nails is the green manicure with the flowers, and as you can see, the manicure is of a very nice quality, especially since it's almost been a week since they were done. Will be returning as a regular!
