3	I'd like to take a quick moment to share  with you my experience as a new customer  I brought my landa surface cleaner in for service  I showed the technician my areas of concern.  Striping and pneumatic wheels are wobbly. I received my unit and invoice says, clean filter, adjusted Nozzles, tested on the surface, replaced caster, $45... labor $75... total $127 The pneumatic wheels are still wobbly, and if the remedy for the striping was to just clean out the filter and adjust nozzles... you could've just told me that and would've been a customer for life. The technician told me over the phone that they did not have the caster in stock.. I told him, it's not something I really need.. That it was not a must-have... But somehow it ended up on few days later the owner contacted me and apologize for the issue
5	We use pressure washers to clean out our screens.  We had one go down and were pretty desperate for the part.  Fortunately Superior Cleaning had it and since they are so easy to get to we were up and running in less than an hour.What made it really great for us is that they saw our guy sitting out waiting for them to open and they opened up early, took care of him, and he was back in no time.  Lots of people will say "sorry we don't open until 7:30, just wait until then".   Nope, they were awesome, opened up and sent him on his way.Thanks, you have gained a customer for life
