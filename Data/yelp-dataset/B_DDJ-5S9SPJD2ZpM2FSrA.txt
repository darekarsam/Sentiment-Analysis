5	Chris gave me a great estimate, was friendly and on time. He was very professional and my carpets have never been cleaner. He also cleaned my tile floors and grout and they aren't black anymore. I didn't even remember them being that clean when I bought the place. I'll use them again and again!
5	Honest and affordable. I would highly recommend hiring this company. You can tell from the moment they pick up the phone that they are a family owned business and want to do the best job for you. Best prices and best work. Don't go anywhere else!!!!
5	Everyone at Sunglow is awesome! The owner and his employees have all been nice, friendly, and super knowledgeable about flooring, how to clean it and how to maintain it.  It is worth it to have a professional company come in and clean the carpets because there are some things your at home run of the mill floor cleaner can't do.  His pricing is also reasonable.  Not only does Chris do floors, he's been doing it for years as part of a family business, and it is clear he has a passion for doing it.  It is refreshing to see someone truly enjoy what he does.  It is also rare these days.  I'd definitely go to Chris and his team for all of my flooring needs.  I've already given his number to a few of my friends.
