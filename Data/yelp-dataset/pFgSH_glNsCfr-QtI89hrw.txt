5	All of the LifeStart Gyms in Phoenix are amazing! The gyms have a very comfortable feel. If you are a hardcore, who just wants to workout and not worry about the "Meat Market" set up..well these are the gyms for you. The staff is great!! At all 3 locations. All the ameneties you need. Including, laundry service!!!
3	This Gym is average at best. It reminds me of gym you would find in a small town, or a retirement community.  The gym is super small, and there is almost no room to do any type of resistance training, and while they do have a good selection of resistance bands/balls etc... they are all tied up in the exercise room, which is only available when a class is not in session.  That being said, their schedule is not up to date on line, so trying to plan around a class is nearly impossible.  On the plus side, the gym is never busy and they do have towel service, lockers and basic toiletries that make a lunch time workout doable. Coming from lifetime fitness, and paying the same monthly dues for 10% of the quality, equipment and amenities, it's hard to give them a fair review.  If you're wondering why I'm complaining about lifestart and not living it up at Lifetime... I switch jobs and needed a gym close to work, otherwise I'd be swimming in the pool and sitting in the Eucalyptus steam room.
5	Renovated with new equipment and big tv s. P25 program of 8 weeks is helping me to lose weight getting me to back to shape. It is convenient if you work in Phoenix Business Plaza and workout before or after work. The staff is knowledgeable and costumer oriented. Drew, the manager is great to work with. If you don't like crowed gyms and work around the area, this is the right gym.
