4	If you are looking for Vietnamese in the Jean-Talon & Parc Ave. neighborhood this is a great spot. They have many delicious varieties of 'pho' on the menu as well as the 'bun' dishes (vermicelli noodles with salad and topping of your choice) and are all reasonably priced. I was initially off-put by the top-40 radio playing, but there were too many positive features to not make me a repeat customer - nice booths, friendly staff (family run!) and of course, fresh & delicious food. *Recommendations - Vegetarian pho and rice pancakes appetizer. BYOB.
4	I had the soup and the vegetarian spring roll. They were both very good.
4	Comfortable restaurnt and food is delicious . Specially recommend bun bo hue
4	One of many good vietnamese restaurants in town. The staff is young and dynamic and the ambiance is casual and friendly.This place is near my school, and so my go-to meal is the bun bo hue (hue-style noodle soup), and it is in my opinion one of the best in town. There are also many other great dishes, such as com ba mao (rice with 2-way porc and a fried egg). Lyla also have many traditional vietnamese meals. One of my favorites is the bot chien (fried rice cakes with eggs served with soy sauce).Overall, Lyla is a great place to discover vietnamese food without being too daring while respecting the classics.
4	Great affordable place and all the food is very fresh. I visit a lot as it is close to my house. Tried quite a few menu items but my favourites are the rare beef and brisket soup and their mixed dumplings and imperial rolls. Yum :)
