5	Starbucks products at church for a yummy service!  I like the fact that everyone who works there does it for free and all of the profits go directly to the church.  Love!
4	I like to order a coffee and grab a book to read when I visit on Friday nights. While I don't attend church at Central, I have found the people and staff I have encountered to be incredibly nice and welcoming. The coffee is good too!
4	Ordered two bagels, a blueberry muffin, 2 fresh ice teas, and a frappacino.  All great!  Makes for a nice meeting spot before the busy service.  Only suggestion-- a nice young lady tries to assist the long line by taking orders before you reach the counter, which actually seems to clog up the line and/or lead to further confusion.  Good seection of books in the bookstore.
