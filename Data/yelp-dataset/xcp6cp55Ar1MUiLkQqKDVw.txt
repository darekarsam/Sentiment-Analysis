5	I had a really good massage at the new location. Don't mistake this for a "parlor", this is a very professional place. I love the fact that I can get an appointment on short notice or just drop in. I also really like massage style, the "Far Eastern" approach is much different than main stream US massage. They are so focused on the customer experience, and quite frankly, feeling so pampered is sooo nice!
5	I was having a girls' weekend with my friend and daughter.  We really wanted some foot reflexology and googled Super Relax.  It was exactly what we were looking for.  Very professional.  We laid in big recliners and enjoyed our massages.  Open daily until 10 pm.  Will definitely return often.
5	one hour of pure massage bliss! I feel reborn like the phoenix . Highly recommended +++
4	OMG! This was my first every foot massage (can't count pedicures) and I totally enjoyed it. After all the heel wearing, exercising and the daily abuse to my feet, this was exactly what I needed.  I went to the Tyvola location and found it to be a hole in the wall gem :). The foot massage area is not a private room.  Rather it is a dark area behind a partition with 5 big/comfy chairs.  When you're getting the massage you don't notice other clients there (if there are any).  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because of slight noise I could hear in the front reception area and the constant buzzing sound in the ceiling.  Nonetheless, I will be going back regularly for foot massages!.
1	My husband & I were there for full body massage. The service was good & the staff was friendly enough, but immediately after we left we begin to itch. We thought we were both allergic to the massage oil, but we are siting at the Dr.'s office right now. We both contracted an infectious rash. We were in different rooms & things appeared clean, but we are certain of where we encountered it. For that reason, we would never return.
