3	I'm not a fast food burger guy at all.  It's been 17 years since I actually ate a Big Mac and at least 4 years since dining at a Wendy's.  But there was a coupon in the mail for their new "Hot 'N Juicy" (the jokes you could start in with are endless!!) burger and we went after some pleading from the wife.I did read in an article about how the Wendy's executives scoured the country for the top burgers, spent thousands of dollars on research and this is what they considered their best effort after a year of trials.  So I was definitely curious.We did drive thru and ate in the car since my wife was wearing a Batgirl costume (Yelp Justice League Pub Crawl on Fremont).  Our coupon was for a free single patty Hot 'N Juicy with the purchase of a small drink and small fries.  The bill appropriately for 2 orders totaled $6.66!The verdict: Not bad but not great either.  If you like Wendy's menu, you will most likely enjoy this.  I would prefer a Whopper if I am blowing massive amounts of calories and fat on a fast food joint.
1	Don't go late night! Got the new pretzel bun burger combo. Cold fries. Luke warm burger. Fast service though. Oh wait. My food was made 30 mins ago. No wonder.
4	This location is okay but most of the time when I come here the food sometimes is fresh and sometimes so it's hit and miss all though with that negative the customer service here is good the times ive come here and they do there best to get your food to you as fast as possible.
