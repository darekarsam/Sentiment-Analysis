1	Pretty less than average grocer here, which a extremely disappointing given its size and relative newness.Went in the other day with a list and had to buy stock for some soup. Found the broth, the soups, but no stock. I'm thinking, noooo. Sure as anything, the clerk and then the manager who had to come out, confirmed they just don't stock stock. Chicken, beef, veggie, none of the above. You gotta be joking! Not only that, they didn't have parsnips either!  Now these items aren't everyday purchases I get that, but come on!!!  At a "super" any grocery store in America these items are sold.  One star may be extreme, but given the awful quality if seafood, high prices, embarrassing wine selection, and the missing items, it's completely warranted.  If I wanted to over spend on crap, I'd shop at the Teeter across the street.  Oh wait, that's exactly what I'm going to do because at least that Teeter, which is half the size, carries all the items I want!
3	Nothing exciting here. Just your average big box food store.
4	I am commenting on the super Bi-lo in Matthews on Fincher Farm lane.  The managers and sales staff are quite friendly and do go out of their way to assist you. They recently overcharged me on an item that was still advertised as buy one get one free but they made good and refunded all the  money plus I got to keep the item. Can't complain about that. I wish they did offer more gourmet items as Harris Teeter does but I like the shopping experience there and they do have good deals on lots of items that I buy frequently. That is why I keep going back.
