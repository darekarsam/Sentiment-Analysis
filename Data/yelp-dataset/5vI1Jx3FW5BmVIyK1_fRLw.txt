2	I purchased Firestone tires in New Jersey and have the "nationwide warranty" that I paid extra for. I had a flat and went in to get it fixed here and they charged me 21.47 to put a patch on my tire. The do not honor the Firestone warranty. The service was fast and good but I was not happy with the warranty situation. Whats wose is they have a HUGE sign in the waiting room that advertises the nationwide warranty.. BS
5	We brought the car in to fix a steering issue that we thought was due to alignment. After an hour of putting it on the alignment racks and getting it ready, they found the alignment to be perfect. Rather than moving forward and charging us, they let us know it was not the issue and did not charge us anything. That kind of honesty is rare in this day and age and was hugely appreciated. Thank you Eddy for your honesty, integrity, and knowledge. We will definitely be coming to you for any of our car troubles when we're in Phoenix.
1	Not a big fan. Hubby went here to get our car inspected. The guy quoted a repair cost that was a bit higher than what we expected. The mechanic tried to pressure my hubby into doing the repairs at their shop. we Went to another repair shop (AAA certified) and we were given a quote of $180 less for the same sevice. We will not be returning to this place.
5	Just bought a '99 Pontiac and within 2 weeks started smelling gas. Turns out an O ring was bad. Brought it to Firestone and they took care of it. Even with having to track down the parts they were able to find the right part and get it fixed. Service was great and the price was very reasonable for what needed to be done.
4	Was leaving out of town and realized the front tires had very little tread left. I called, thinking it would be a slim chance we could get new tires so quickly, but they said "go ahead and bring the car in now". An hour and a half later we were on the road, good to go!
