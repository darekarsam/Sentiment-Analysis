1	The only thing that they provide is a month bill.   There service sucks and you will spent more time waiting for them to really fix it than it's worth.
2	My only option for internet is wireless. I don't have Cox or Centurylink in my neighborhood. The download speed I pay for is 1.5Mb but I rarely get that speed. It's really bad in the afternoons and evenings when everyone in the neighborhood is home using the internet. We all share the bandwidth but Wydebeam won't tell you that. I've used Wydebeam for 3 years now and I think they've been bought out twice.
