5	Every time we stop here the service is excellent and accurate! Even while training a new employee Emily kept the line moving and service great!!

There was only one customer in there and she was leaving so we didn't have to wait. I asked for a 6 inch Subway Melt on flatbread. When he asked me what kind of cheese I looked down and saw roast beef instead of bacon. I told him I wanted the Melt not the Club. He fixed it promptly. The guy also didn't overdo the mustard and pickles as they often do. Took my sandwich, M&M cookie, and iced tea to go. When I got home the sandwich was still warm and the flatbread was soft. Good cookie too!
5	Clean and fast. Your average subway restaurant. Considering it's in a busy place, I have never had to wait too long to get my food. They also made my sandwich according to my bizarre requests without complaining :)
