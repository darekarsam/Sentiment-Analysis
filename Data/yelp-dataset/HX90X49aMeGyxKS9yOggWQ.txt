1	stay away from this!!! you will end up pay more than you expected!! Don't waste your time!!
1	just wanna update. We end up getting the stock cabinets from home depot with a lot cheaper price(with the same layout) + warranty + no assembly cost + free truck to get your cabinets+ ready to pick up.So, stay away from this store!!!!
1	While we were happy with the quality of the cabinets we received here, the customer service was abysmal. If you don't mind not getting phone calls returned and constantly badgering for the latest status, go somewhere else. You might end up paying a little more, but it will be worth it in the end.
