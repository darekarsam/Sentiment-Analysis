5	I've been participating in the bootcamp program for over 3 years.  Dianna is innovative, lives the results of the commitment, hard work to get your body in shape no matter what age, size or level.  I love starting my day at 7am and feeling like I accomplished something positive for my body, mind and spiritual well-being....Gotta be in the program to get a different set of results....Come on out to Elon Park and give is a try, I did and I love it.

5	I have been taking Dianna's bootcamp from the start and I love it!!  The classes are always different so I never get bored with doing the same workout over and over.  She pushes me more than I would ever push myself but yet no pressure.  Come join the bootcamp and see what a great workout you will have.  You won't be disappointed!  Dianna and the boot campers are AWESOME!
5	Prior to my wedding, I wanted to begin a workout routine to lose some inches/pounds before the big day, but I wanted something more than heading to the gym daily doing the same old routines. Dianna was highly recommended to me by one of my friends and so I signed up for some personal training sessions and I'm so glad I did. Dianna not only focuses on the exercise but she also gave me tips on ways to improve my diet to enhance the results. I truly appreciated how each workout session was completely different, challenging and fun (except for the squats, the squats were not fun :) ). She really catered her time with me to my abilities and pushed me to achieve the results I was looking for. I worked with Dianna for almost 4 months and felt strong and so happy with my end result. Even after the wedding, I used many of the strength building exercises I'd learned to help me train and complete a triathlon a few months later.Dianna is really supportive and truly cares about each person that comes to her; she ended up being a good friend that I could talk to through my many stresses of wedding planning and beyond.
