5	I found Holly through word of mouth.  She took the time to listen to my concerns and came up with a solution to highlights with the right base color.  My hair looks amazing.I have gone back again and have learned that she now has loyalty pricing if you come regularly.  I think rewarding loyalty is genius and it helps with the overall cost of beauty.I followed Holly from a rented chair to her new private salon suite and this is a big improvement. I like the privacy that the suite offers and the escape from the smells of other services.  Her space is inviting with refreshments available, the usual magazines and friendly conversation.  I also liked the TV which is helps pass the time while the color processes.
5	After making a huge mistake and trying out a local beauty school, I asked around for a reputable hairdresser that could help fix it. Holly came highly recommended by numerous people.  So I gave her a try. She was terrific.  I was a little worried, but she was patient and made me feel she had everything under control.  And she did. Not only did she fix my hair color, she also gave me complete new "do". I love it. I've been going to her ever since. She's great!!!!
5	I went to Holly after three months of no haircut. She was very friendly and professional. She listened to what I wanted and didn't try to push me into anything I hadn't asked for. I love how she cut my hair and will definitely see her again!
