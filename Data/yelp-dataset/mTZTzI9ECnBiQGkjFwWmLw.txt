5	Best sushi I've had in ages. Great spot.
3	Incredibly overpriced, tiny portions. Won't be going back.
5	Decided to try this place out last night.  .... sooo glad we did. It's cute & quaint, food was fresh & service was good.  We had the seafood Oudon soup to start (we shared it as it was large) which was amazing ....highly recommend it! Seafood terriaki was also amazing & the sushi, sashimi & rolls were extremely good.
5	This place has some of the best sushi I've ever had.I've been going by it for years but didn't bother entering because of its hole-in-the-wall exterior, but a colleague (who has spent many years in Japan) strongly recommended it saying he never lets a trip to the West Island go by without dining there.It's very neat, the staff is extremely friendly. A great spot for a little dinner among friends or a casual night for two.The sushi is absolutely excellent. On the small side, but bursting with flavour. Melts in your mouth and blends together marvellously.A must.
5	I love this place. I have been going there for years and I try to visit it every time I am back in Montreal. They are a small location - be prepared to get acquainted with your neighbouring dining mates - but I see they've expanded in the last little while, so that's great. Fish is fresh (fantastic sashimi) and they have unique takes on maki. They have an excellent spicy scallop nigiri. Their salad dressing is to die for... I wish they would bottle it already (though Wafu is a comparable option). It definitely isn't cheap (even their lunch specials are on the pricier side) but I am willing to pay more for high quality sushi.
