5	A small business that purveys fresh, high-quality, 100% local produce AND gives a hefty portion of the proceeds to charities. What's not to love?They also have a serious commitment to helping others become avid locavores. Also, they sell kale. And bok choi. Come on! This is my kind of place.Pricing is pretty simple, too. I think you can get 4 bunches of veggies for $10. And the good news is that they take cards using Square. Sweet. Perfect for this cashless girl.They don't have a permanent setup, so the best way to find them is by following them on the social medias and checking their website. Or just look for the soccer moms lining up to buy killer carrots and sweet potatoes.
5	Two passionate dudes who have the drive to set up a traveling farmer's market with gorgeous produce. Yep. I can dig it. Stopped by their outside of the 7th Street Public Market on a recent weekend to hear a little more about their story and also snag some fresh produce. One of the best parts about their produce is that it's pre-portioned, bound, or bagged. I know one of my biggest problems is constantly buying far too much produce. I greatly appreciate the portions they had. We picked up some carrots, popcorn, onions, dill and mint. Used most of these to make dinner for friends this past weekend and the freshness definitely shined through. So good. Can't wait to visit these dudes again soon.
