1	AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. Not only will I NEVER return to this location but I will be sure to never refer another person ever again. An acne medicine of mine was no longer covered under my insurance. The pharmacy informed me this was an easy fix and my Dermatologist would need to fax over a prescription for a "sister" medication. Since I have been traveling for 2 months due to work I was relieved.I reached out to English Dermatology, Dr. Brinegar to be exact, and NEVER received even a simple call back regarding my medication after leaving 3 voicemails. My pharmacy even sent over multiple prescription requests. Not sure what type of business considers such behavior as acceptable. Anyone with skin issues like myself knows there is nothing more frustrating than an outrageous breakout that will not go away. This is what happens after 2 months. If English Dermatology needed my co-pay THAT bad all they had to go was call. At this point, I would of wired them the funds. Horrible customer service and clearly they do not genuinely want to help their clientele.
1	Honestly, I have gone to this dermatologist several times. I didn't feel like any of the doctors actually cared about my situation. Everytime I have gone, I wait 30 mins in a room, when the doctor comes in, he spends maybe 2 minutes with me before prescribing some pill and sends me on my way. Awful experience
5	New doctor just started working there was very informative and answered all of my questions and concerns. Was hesitant to go to go this office based on prior review but I was able to quickly get into to see the doctor and staff was friendly.
