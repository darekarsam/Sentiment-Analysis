4	I am at this CVS..well WAYYY too much..they have always been coupon friendly..and I get my prescriptions there alot and they have always been willing to work with me! Tony is the best and you have to try the magic coupon machine near the front!
5	Walk into this CVS Darcy store manager is AMAZING! Helpful, greets you when you walk in, super kind- yet not annoyingly kind, PRESENT! Rare in LV to receive such grand costumer service!So happy and thankful!
5	I love the fact that they no longer cell cigarettes! YaY!!! I get my prescriptions from this CVS - I love the drive through it's quick and easy, and I go in once in awhile just to grab an ice-cream or water. The staff is always very friendly.
