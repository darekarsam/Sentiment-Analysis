5	Sushi were fresh, tasty and amazing!! They dont stuff u with rice and their home made sauce is so flavourful! Looks more like a takeout place, but i ate on the spot with my boyfriend and the plating was beautiful "digne d'un restaurant"   The sushi makers were great as well, very friendly!
5	amazing take out spot for sushi .. best bang for the buck also.. Must try at least once and ull be convince. Always fresh
4	i like this place. they are a short walk away and they deliver too which is great when the weather is not clement.what i don't like is they tend to run out of ingredients that i want but lately, they've been better with stock management.as for service, they are courteous and friendly but can take a while though so best to call ahead and pick it up after. there's a couple of tables and counter seats to sit at but i rarely see anyone eating in.its good, fills the craving at reasonable price.
4	I recently discovered Nobu. I was trying to fulfill my sushi cravings. Loved their sushi! Delivery services were pretty quick! Their sushi was great! Not too much rice or tempura and the price is fairly reasonable. My sushi rolls came with four different sauces but I had no idea which sauce was supposed to be with which roll. My only suggestion would be to label the sauces for deliveries and take outs!
