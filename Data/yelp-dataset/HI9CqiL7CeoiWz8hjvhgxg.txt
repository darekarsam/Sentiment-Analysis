4	Yelp doesn't seem to be all that popular in Pittsburgh. That could be because folks here know their local haunts and are pretty loyal. As someone who ends up in the city for work, this makes things tricky. So, I'm going to review some spots.Shale's is a dive bar. It also happens to be right across from the Consol Energy Center, making it the perfect place to stop in for beers before/after an event of your tastes skew more towards cheap drafts and a jukebox with GNR, than say TGI McFunsters across the street. They've got a small range of local, domestic and international brews, but there should be something to satisfy everyone in your group (as long as nobody wants wine).They serve drinks in plastic cups (which should clarify what type of place this is) and allow smoking.
4	Great downtown dive bar with great prices. The bartender was a class act and we talked for awhile about the history of the city. Prices are ridiculously low. Love it. Will be back here the next time I am in Pittsburgh.
5	I like this place a lot. Went here after a Pens game with my bf. What a great location across from Consol. Drink prices are very reasonable for the location.
5	Shale's cafe is the best. This is where my fiance and I always go before and after Pens games. The atmosphere is great. The bartenders are great. I also met my fiance here so the place is extra special to me! If you're going to a Pens game or event at CONSOL Energy Center go to Shale's.
5	Shale's is my favorite bar in Pittsburgh. Unlike other places in the city, it is affordable. Lindsey is the bartender on Wednesdays and she is wonderful. The owner often mans the bar and is a great guy, always recognizes our faces, and quick to cheer up any guest. My boyfriend and I check Shale's before going anywhere else, every time.
