5	I've had many spray tans with various companies over the past few years and a Brilliant bronze has been the best. The applications are customized to skin type so their tans not only look the best they last the longest.  I usually get a spay tan from them every 2 weeks or so because they're prices are lowest or at least the same
5	I love my tan!  I have been tanning with a Brilliant Bronze for months now.  I am always thoroughly satisfied with my new color and the customer service that goes with.  I go from porcelain white to sun kissed over night, and I receive so many complements on how my skin color looks.  I always receive a text or phone call the next day to make sure I love my tan!!  Thank you Brilliant bronze!
5	Lisa of A Brilliant Bronze is amazing. I have used her for both her mobile offering and have gone to her house for a tan. She is always very accommodating and is a perfectionist. She makes sure to understand how your skin naturally tans to ensure she uses the right formula and doesn't turn you orange. The last tan I got from her lasted a good week before I started to have areas of fading. She also always follows up and makes sure you are happy with your tan. I will definitely continue to use Lisa for future tanning needs.
