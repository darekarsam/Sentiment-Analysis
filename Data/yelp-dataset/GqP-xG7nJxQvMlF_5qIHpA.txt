5	I rarely crave for red meat, but the other day I needed a boost of iron.  The perfect small ribeye steak cost a whopping $21, but was as good as you can get at a top steak house.  It cooked perfectly on my skillet with kosher salt and pepper.  The meat was tender, perfectly marbled with an amazing flavor.  Now I will need to buy a roast and grill it.
