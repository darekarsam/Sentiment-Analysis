5	I came here to find a Christmas gift. I felt a little reluctant walking in, it almost seemed too fancy for me. However, the service was great and really made us feel at home. He gave us samples of some of his favourite olive oils and vinegars, and didn't pressure us at all. Walked out with a great and unique present. I was really happy with the quality of the product and especially with the quality of service! If you're in the market for a unique gift for yourself, or for the food lover in your family, this is just the spot.
5	Great products, in addition to a steadily rolling stock of oils from everywhere in the world, they also have very nice balsamic vinegar.But best of all is the service, very friendly and very knowledgeable. The eerily precise taste descriptions given prior to sampling the oils are what made me a repeat customer!
