5	This place changed the way I looked at my car. I swear to God. I am totally useless in the context of auto repair. I know how to change a tire, but that's about where it ends. Because of that, I know I get taken. Often. Until these guys, I would even say always. Mike, who runs Saguaro, is totally honest in his dealings and knows that if he cuts fair deals with his customers they will come back. And we do. Before I ever take anything to the dealership I call them up here and explain my problem. If they can conceivably handle it I take it to them and get it done for literally a small fraction of what the dealership charges for the same task. Do yourself a favor and try them out.
1	Don't trust these guys.   I had my mother-in-law drop off my car while out of town.  They must have seen dollar signs with an older lady who obviously doesn't know about cars.Gave us a ridiculous quote on a simple solution.  Then tried charging us 175$ just to diagnose the issue. Ended up paying $100 after a debate.  Should''t have had to pay a dime.Issue was a fuse.Pretty sad.  Any mechanic with some integrity could do well in this city, too many con artists out here.
5	I wouldn't take my car anywhere else.  They are honest, friendly and reasonable.  They do great work the first time and explain everything in plain English.  Highly recommend them.  Actually, I have told my neighbors and one is super happy and the other neighbor will be going next week.
