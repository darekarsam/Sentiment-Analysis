3	Was there yesterday night for a business meeting and generally it's a nice place, service was good and generally diligent.As an entree I went for a simple salad that had way too much oil and vinegar... a bit disappointing. As a main course, I ate a nice piece of meat and the presentation was very nice on a wooden board... not a bad thing really.Still I find myself wondering the cost associated for the meal and the lack of ahh generally.Personally, I think you can find better at a lower cost for a similar meal; but nothing negative really. I'd be inclined to say that I'm left indifferent with this place.
4	Wanted to try this resto for a while. Saw it on the event "Montreal a table" so called to make a reservation. The food was not bad. I saw the less good reviews and couldn't really understand why. Maybe I am just lucky. This is the part about restaurant that is difficult to rate, the food quality that are not consistent. Service was so so, little slow at filling our glass of water. The place have very nice decor. Overall I like the experience. Hope it could keep up the good work not just for "Montreal a table"
