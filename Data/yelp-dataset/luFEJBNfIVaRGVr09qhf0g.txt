4	This is truly an unknown gem for many montrealers. This park is next to 2 metro stations (viau & pie-IX) and provides a number of great running and cycling paths and trails. The park also offers a substantial amount of open green space along with nice mature wooded areas.There is also a building on site known as "the chalet" that offers vending machine, tables, bathrooms and a changing area.
