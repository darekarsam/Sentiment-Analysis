5	I came to this location 2 weeks ago to rent out a storage space for my mom and I to share and it was a wonderful experience! A woman named Doris helped us and she was so friendly and made the process very quick and easy for us. Will definitely refer any friends here if they ever need a storage space.
5	The manager and assistant manager were exceptional when it came to addressing my self storage needs.  Both Jan and Doris were able to find the right size unit and within my budget.  The property is clean, secure and well maintained.  Jan and Doris took me through the rental agreement so that it was easily understood and the process was painless and timely.  I would recommend this rental location to my friends and family because of the excellent customer service and the convenient location of the property. I will surely come back to Uncle Bob's in the future.
5	I have had to use several storage facilities throughout the years due to work. Uncle Bobs has been far and above any facility I have used in the past. The staff is always available and on premises which is more than many other storage facilities can say. Whenever I have to access my unit I always stop in to say hi to the friendly faces behind the desk. I seem to see Doris the majority of time. She is so fun, friendly and professional!  If you are in the area, there is no better place to store your stuff!!
