3	Just a heads up, this rating is only for cravings past 2am, usually when drunk and/or completely starved, this place is a hole while the sunlight is up.  Now having said that, 2 tacos for 99 cents and super scrumptious milkshakes, not sure what else you could ask for!!
4	I am not a big fan of fast food but when I do get the craves this is where I go.  They have it all, good burgers, some on sour dough buns, tacos, egg rolls and a changing menu of  specialty sandwiches.  Plus a great breakfast menu.  Oh, and you can get burgers and breakfast all day long, can't beat that.
3	I popped in here looking to see if they had any antenna balls. They were out and were getting new ones in, but didn't know exactly when. They had a picture to show me what they looked like but that didn't really help me.I grabbed a Jumbo Jack while I was in. It was tasty and gave me my taste of JITB that I can't get in Canada.
