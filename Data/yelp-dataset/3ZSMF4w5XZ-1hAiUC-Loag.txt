5	Elissa Conte, APRN is absolutely fabulous! She's extremely knowledgable and takes the time to correctly assess medical issues, as well as treat them. She's very personable and has such a caring attitude with her patients. I strongly recommend her!
5	I have been a patient at Glimpse for over a month. I have been to other clinics in Las Vegas and had been very disappointed.  Once I met  Dr. Oliver and her entire staff I have found this to be the most professional and caring place I have ever been to.  They all take an interest to make sure you receive the best results possible. The entire team is trained to answer any questions. If you are looking for a positive place to assist in losing weight look no further. Not only is there an MD on site there is a great diet coach/dietician plus all the wonderful girls who support them.  They also offer many other services. I could not have lost 19 lbs in 20 days without their support. Please do not hesitate to make an appointment.
5	Jill is awsome! Such a life changing experience. New moms and moms with young ones great options for Losing the baby weight!!! I will always recommend them!
5	My Mom has been going here and has had great success with her weight loss!  I went for the B12 injection.  The office staff is very nice and accommodating.  I'll be back this week for shot #2.  If you go just for the B shot you don't have to have an appointment which makes it very convenient.
5	I have been a patient for 4 years , I love Dr Oliver , she has aways helped me maintain my weight .I haven't been for awhile and I plan on going back by the end of January..I aways get the 3 month package which works for me .. The office staff is aways very helpful and polite..thank you !!  look forward to seeing y'all this year ..
