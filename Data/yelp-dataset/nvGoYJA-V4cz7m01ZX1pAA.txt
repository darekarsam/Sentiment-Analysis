3	Big Lots is a running joke among most of my peeps, but that's ok with me.  Some of us enjoy scoping bargains, even if it means perusing big lots of irrelevant stuff.  The University City Big Lots is no exception to Big Lot's rule of randomness and low prices, but this store is kinda cramped in comparison to other BL's in Charlotte.Located in the former Circuit City, this Big Lots is kinda squeezed.  Maybe that the makes the store less random in what they stock (?), but I can't really tell.  The highlights of this particular BL are:-Furniture-overstocked namebrands like Ashley.  Watch out for their brands-I've seen used Big Lots sofas at thrift shops looking pretty beat up-Cords and cable for computers and cell phones (I told you it was randomness)-Seasonal goods-cheap grills, patio furniture, and those obnoxiously large burger flipping spatulasWith all sincerity, don't come to Big Lots with a shopping list.  You might be dissapointed, even if you see it on sale in their circular.  Instead, look at a shopping trip to BL as a treasure hunt and you'll be pleasantly suprised.  Feliz compras! [Happy shopping!]
3	It's a Big Lots. They have some junk in there but some cool finds such as iPhone cases, rugs, bedroom accessories, etc. Prices are easily comparable to Wal-Mart so I rarely stop by unless I need something specific.I bought an auxiliary cord from here and returned it hassle free with the receipt. I was glad that they were able to refund me even though I had it opened out the package.
