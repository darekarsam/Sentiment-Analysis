4	Good kosher pizza. Salad bar is great. Solid sandwiches and soups.
4	This kosher pizza is comparable to NY pizza! It was surprisingly amazing! The dough was especially delicious. I also had the vegetarian meatball parmigiana that I've never seen anywhere else! I definitely recommend it to people who are shomer kashrut and vegetarians!
5	After a long day, we decended on Milky Way in a party if ten, with half a dozen children. The staff were welcoming and helpful. The food was hot and fresh. Even the pizza was good and I am not a huge fan.  We had falafel in different forms, very good, esp. the green hot sauce!!!  And some kid friendly stand bys like pizza and fries- which some places get lax on. Not here though. Hot, fresh, and tasty!! And BEST of all Kosher.
5	Go here at least once a week on average.  Great people, great food!Favorites are the tuna melt, and salad bar.
