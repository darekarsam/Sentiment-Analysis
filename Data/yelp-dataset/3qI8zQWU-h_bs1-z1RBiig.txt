1	Paid 700 dollars for massages with Jerry costa and after he secured payment he became very moody because i wanted tues, wed. back to back massages and to focus on the lower body. He wanted to do it his way. It's my money, and i layed out my terms to begin with. Won't return calls or money. Thief.
5	Jerry is phenomenal! I used the super easy online booking to make my appointment. I had an absolutely wonderful 90 minute deep tissue massage. The massage area is located inside a beautiful yoga studio. It was the perfect environment to feel completely relaxed. I look forward to my next massage!
5	I have had two 90 minute deep tissue/trigger point massages from Jerry and they were fantastic, and among the very best I've ever had. The man is knowledgeable/skilled, professional, and strong. I will see him again. Thank you!
