2	Do not go here if you want quick service.  I dropped my dry cleaning off on a Wednesday and was told it would be done by Friday.  When I went in on Friday morning he said it was not done yet and wouldn't be done until after 2pm.  Also very over priced.
4	I agree with BOTH of the reviewers. These guys take a LONG time, and once in awhile I'm welcomed by a napping owner. I only go here when I'm not in a rush to get things back. And the reason I keep going back is because they do a great job and it's very convenient to and from work. They also have shoe repair which is very convenient.  I think their pricing is fair. I just really like that they have a lot of service options. I have been to cheaper cleaners, and you get what you pay for.
1	Very poor customer service. Have a special listed saying 10 items for 39.95 but if you have 11 items they charge you full price and you are not eligible for the cheaper rate. They also don't count your items and list the number on your claim check so if something is lost your out of luck. There are too many options in uptown. I will not try them again.
1	Ruined a dress shirt that I took in with one small stain that I could live with, but I thought to give the cleaners a shot. Got my shirt back with ten or so stains just on the front. How does that happen?!  My husband picked it up without a warning and paid for it, completely unaware. First and last visit for me.
5	Very reliable, does a quality job, good location.  Apparently yelp needs this to be longer so blahhhh blahhhh blahhh 5 stars
