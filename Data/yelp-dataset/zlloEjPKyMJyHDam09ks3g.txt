5	I'm a HUGE fan of Solstice. I buy most of my sunglasses from them. So when I happened to walk by the OUTLET STORE in Vegas, I nearly fainted.$300 sunglasses marked down to $119. Dior, Gucci, Fendi, the list goes on! They even had glasses going for $80! They also sold regular priced items too. Super great selection and all sunglass collections were up to date.
4	This is my first time I've been to Solstice.   The sun is harsh in Vegas and I needed a new pair!I was able to sneak away for some power shopping while hubby watched the kid.  I was greeted by friendly, not pushy, sales staff who helped me find the right pair that complemented me.  The staff had adjusted the nose pads for me while I browsed.  Only bummer is that my mall coupon didn't apply even though the coupon does not specify $25 off the RETAIL price.  It just says if you spend over $125, you get $25 off.
5	I was so happy to see this Solstice when I came to these outlets! Even if I'm not looking for sunglasses, I make it a point to stop by a Solstice Outlet when I see one! I'm obsessed with sunglasses! I have about 8 pairs of sunglasses and 6 of them were from Solstice! They have sunglasses for all styles and all price ranges! On top of it being an outlet, they have great sales from time to time!I was lucky enough this past visit to find a sweet pair of Gucci sunglasses for around $170. The staff here are so informative, professional, helpful and cool! The store is so organized as well! LOVE SOLSTICE!
