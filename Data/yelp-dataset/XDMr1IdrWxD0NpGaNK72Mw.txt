5	AmberJoy at United Artisans of America is extremely friendly and welcoming.  The United Artisans of America shop is inviting and has a comfortable atmosphere.  When you walk around in there you immediately feel as though you are at home and want to stay awhile!AmberJoy has great vision and values the inspiration available in the community around her.  That is what makes United Artisans of America a great asset in Fort Mill and the surrounding areas.
