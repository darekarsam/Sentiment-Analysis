5	I love this salon, the service is excellent  and staff is friendly and efficient.  I always have Richard to do my nails and Tri to do my pedi thery're the best!!!I'm always please with their service, fully recommend it.
5	I love this place. The staff is very courteous and do the job right! the techs take their time with you and are very detail oriented. Massages take longer than the average nail salon, maybe because they are not crowed opposed to the average salon. Another thing I like about this place is that they use various nail polish lines like OPI, Essie, China Glaze, Klean Color etc. so there are many colors to choose from.
5	Went to this place again while on vacation and I had the most relaxing pedicure. I'm not sure what happened to the reviewer below which apparently is not happy with got she got, I respect her input, what I don't appreciate is her belittling my review and erroneously stating "reviews from friends" which is not the case, I love this place and every time I'm in Charlotte I visit them. The place is clean and the staff is detailed oriented and respectful. The place is clean and up to date.
