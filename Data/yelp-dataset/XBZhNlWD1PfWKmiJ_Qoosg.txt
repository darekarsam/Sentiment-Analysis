1	I guess they think you will not see what they actually sent. Let's just  say I was mortified Cheap, cheap cheap.in my opinion  I should have went to the grocery store myself. But it gets better when I called to inquire hoping there was some mistake, trying to give them benefit of the doubt I get a argumentative lady with a foreign accent. I desperately wanted to recoup the money   I felt they messed up. She flatly refused to do anything to make the situation better.       in other words I felt ripped off big time. A honest business person would had made it right but instead chose to go this route well .......Sorry I was forced to go this route Take the time to put you on yelp and expose your stupid business decision
1	My poor children who live out of state, have no idea how cheap and ugly the flowers I just received from Carmel Florist are. They do not resemble the online photo at all. I actually laughed at the gentleman who delivered them to my door. They spent $60 and they are not even worth $6. Shame on you for calling yourself a florist! I took photos just to prove what was delivered.
5	I ordered flowers to be placed in advance on the table at the restaurant my wife and I went to for our 5th anniversary.  They came from Carmel Florist and were perfect.  Great vase, vibrant colors, and perfectly fresh.  They lasted a long time afterwards too.  Will definitely order again.
