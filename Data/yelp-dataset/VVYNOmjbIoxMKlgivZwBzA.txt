5	We have had them put in new curbing (six different areas!) and re-lay our front walk.  Every piece of work has been impeccable and the guys that come out are so nice.  I can't recommend them high enough.  Very economical too.  You can't get any better than this company for response time, quality of work and price.
5	Because we are foster parents. Any children below the age of six, we must have a pool fence. Create A Curb was recommended by our fence installer. We needed 50 feet of curb installed, 20 ft of it was added in the last minute. There was no issues, very professional crew. Did the job in one day, matched the color I wanted, and have had no issues since the job was completed.
