5	pretty good artisanal charcuterie/deli in la plaza st-hubert that sells mostly pork related items. and most of the items are made in-house like their smoked bacon, sausages (including gluten free ones), boudins and so on.if you have the munchies, they have made to order sandwiches that are good and pretty inexpensive (salami is good but the sausage/sauerkraut sandwich, the better and tastier choice imo) they have other ready to eat meals as well as plenty of frozen goods. their sausages and sandwiches are what i mostly buy from them. they tend to run out of things by sunday though.very friendly helpful staff and owner and great service.price is quite fair.definitely one of the better and popular fixture on la plaza.
