5	Great food! A lot of different appetizers were given. This restaurant follows a typical 3 course "Italian" dinner with an antipasto, primo and secundo. An antipasto and secundo complement each other well if you want to eat meat. Great food!!
5	Sapore is an amazing find. I had the best meal I've had in ages there last night. The food is exquisite, fresh, and delicious. The service is warm, friendly and incredibly professional. The decor is beautiful: upscale yet not pretentious. Great music, and not played too loud. I would wholeheartedly recommend Sapore to anyone for a romantic tete-a-tete or private party. Although we live on the other side of town, we will definitely be back! A must visit.
1	I had gone when they first opened awhile ago with my girlfriends and we all loved it. Last time I went was 3 years ago for my birthday. My plate was great. I had the veal chop with vegetable and risotto. However what was very disappointing was their seafood linguine wrapped in banana leaf. Two people had take it and when it arrived it was cold. Lethe mussels had a horrible taste and the plate smelled like a sewer on a hot day. It was unedible. When we asked them to replace the waiter told us the only thing hey could do was heat it in the microwave!!! They still charged us for it and we have not gone back since.
