4	Just opened 2 days ago. I know it will make very good business- much needed in the area. Right inside the miracle mile mall of planet Hollywood
4	It's open. It's chipotle. A little on the small side but there's extra seating in the mall.
5	We come here several times every time we're in Vegas and it's always amazing. Everything is so fresh, it tastes even better than at home!
