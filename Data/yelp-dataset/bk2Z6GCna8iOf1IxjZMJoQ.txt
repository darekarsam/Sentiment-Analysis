5	Raquel has been doing my hair for years. Not just anyone can work with naturally curly hair.. It's better to make an appointment. Raquel is pretty flexible though. She does children's and men's hair too.
5	I had the pleasure to experience Raquel's professional hairstyling services for the first time this afternoon and I must say that I was thoroughly impressed. Her skills and expertise are definitely top notch. She certainly has won me over as a client and I plan on returning for all of my hairstyling needs.
5	Best colorist I've ever had - been seeing her for 5 years now & I commute from wherever I'm living to have her do my hair! She's amazing. She will exceed your desires and is a true genius and artist with the art of blondes and extensions.
