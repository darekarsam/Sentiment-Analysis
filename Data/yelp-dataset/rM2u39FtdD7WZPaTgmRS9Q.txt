5	great food, great bar, great staff.
4	I've been to this place about three times now, and it's always been good.  The staff are pretty friendly, even telling us the history of the bar and it's past as a hotel.  They make a mean burger and their Saturday Prime Rib is pretty darn good given the price.  The marinated steak however is more like dried out chuck roast.  I won't be getting that again.Overall though, it's a place I will enjoy going to again.  It's earned it's atmosphere, and after 87 years, it's earned it's spot as a landmark.P.S.  One more thing, we found out that if you want the Prime Rib on Saturdays, you'd better get there early, or call ahead and reserve your cut.
5	i love it here. definatly a throwback era.
3	Not bad,  not great. Nice atmosphere with kind and professional staff. Food? Typical bar food, nothing spectacular at all. Great place for older folks.
4	Tried the fried shrimp (very good), fresh green beans, onion rings are great.  Just a bit pricey for the food/atmosphere.
