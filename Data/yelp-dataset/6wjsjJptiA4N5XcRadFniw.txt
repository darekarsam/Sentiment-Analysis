2	They have a wide variety of takeout dishes, chinese, fries, hamburgers and pizza are passable. The rest is plainly bad. Takeout service took me forever on a monday, and I also had bad service over the phone. Not horrible, but you can do far better.
1	Awful service, when I called to check up on my online order, they hung up on me.When I managed to get through a second time they denied having any Internet orders.I called again and they said they would check my order and call me back. They never did.I got in touch with Just Eat who then confirmed that the order was completed and said the delivery was on it's way. It arrived over an hour late.When it arrived it was sub par and delivered with Pepsi not Coke (if you only have one, don't offer a choice).Terrible service. Steer clear.
