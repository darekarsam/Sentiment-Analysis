5	WOW!!! OMG!!! YAY!!!!Super amazing food!!I heard from that place from 2 good foodie friends so tonite was THE night I tried it!! I called last nite around 1am to make a rsvp and the only thing available was at 5:30pm at the bar until 7pm. It was perfect timing as we had to leave early for Hockey game at 7pm.We arrived early at 5:30m, we were the 2nd customer to arrive and my only EARLY dinner RSVP EVER! But we were well received my the hostess (male) and welcomed to the bar where we made rsvp and Alexandre took care of us.I have to say that the staff can't be better than this. Was surprised to find out that it was ALL male!.They are all very polite, knowledgeable, friendly, happy and very customer oriented....so rare these days!The restaurant looks good, black color with stainless steel deco with a LONG bar (my fav!) and an open kitchen, YES!!!This is the kind of resto that you can order whatever and you are assured that it will taste fantastic.We started the nite with the betterave, rillettes of maquereau and agneau carpaccio. Then we followed with riz de veau, morue, onion rings and ravioli with squash. Interesting to find out that the wine list includes just as much white as red wine....not suprised since it is a FISH place!The PERK of this place is that is it kinda Tapas dish size.....just slightly larger.They do encourage sharing the plates.I would try this place again and again!!I would recommend it again and agin!!Super excited about Chasse et Peche quality food and price but a casual flair about it.I still wanna cry about about the MORUE!!! It was more than delicious!
5	Hands down.  The best restaurant I have ever been to in Montreal.  Amazing use of fresh ingredients.  Fantastic MENU and the environment/service was impeccable.  A must!
3	Vibe: Real Housewives of Montreal on a girl's night out.Food: Inconsistent. Some dishes were outstanding, others mediocre. DIshes are very small, meant for sharing, be prepared to order more than they suggest. The onion rings were the best I've ever eaten. Really, in my life, the best.Service: Very friendly, very helpful, very slow.Overall, fine, nothing exceptional.
2	Overpriced for the quality and service. Food was decent, but very small plates, like two bites per plate (which would have been fine if the quality was there). Only one plate stood out as excellent (Japanese plum/wasabi). Was underwhelmed by the service - waiter was sloppy and slow.  Decor was ok, but nothing exceptional. Honestly, I'm not sure why this place gets so much hype.
5	I've been to every good place in Montreal. Multiple times. Le Filet is my favorite. Hands down. Warning: if you enter that place you are guaranteed to become addicted and spend a lot of money there. I did. I just finished my yearly expenses and I spent good 4-figures there this year. And now about the restaurant:Location - very nice area on Mont Royal street. In between 2 beaten passes - St Laurent and Parc. In the middle of everything, while not super crowded. Lots of green grass around during summer (nice sports fields across the street). Tons of street parking around (major plus). Ambiance - Very good one. However, it can get extremely loud there to the point that you can lose your voice, since everybody is trying to be louder than everybody else. Their terrace is very good so try to get a table there if you are hitting Le Filet in summer. Management - very well done. A good looking girl will greet you at the door, offer some wine, and take your jacket. Actually, hold on, one of the owners most likely will, before the girl manages to. Even though it is a borderline posh place, owners are super down to earth and will take care of you well. Last time I accidentally spilled someone else' wine onto that same someone else. Guess what, the owner was right there to fix the situation. No animals were injured in the process. Menu - interesting stuff to read. Le Filet is following the latest trend of small plates. $15-$20 a plate. You will need 5-6 plates for a good dinner for 2. The menu is organized into 5-6 groups by type of seafood/non-seafood they have. I advice to:a. trust their waiters' suggestions (did that first 2 times, did not get disappointed)b. pick 1 plate from each group. If you manage to screw this one up... you are a very special one. Food - it is AWESOME. I would kill for their 1/2 lobsters. And I would kill the person who decided to remove their sweet buttersqaush ravioli from the menu. I almost got a heart attack when I found out. Their fried oysters are mindblowing. Kurobata pork is good. Basically everything there is worth trying (hence, the danger to get addicted). Wine - their cellar is VERY, VERY decent. One of the first times I came I tried this italian wine, filtered through volcanic ashes. Wasn't able to find anything similar in Montreal. Trust their owner or waiters. I haven't been disappointed. Verdict - my favorite place, and I'm very hard to please. Great location, ambiance, attitude, and most important - food. A perfect recipe for an awesome foodie night out.
5	My favorite tapas resto in Montreal. Expensive as hell but worth it. Each bite is a revelation. This lace was opened by the guys who opened chasse et peche and they know what they're doing...
4	Excellent food! Excellent service!!The decor is really cool and trendy.The octopus and the sea bass are really good.The owner and hostess actually take your coats and check them. (Super cool)It is expensive but realize you are paying for high quality and delicious food.I would definitely go back.
3	Great atmosphere and menu selection - though the execution falls short with small sharing portions and seemingly bland food.
5	Awesome service and food.....the best!
5	Best overall meal I had in 2012.  Highly like the execution of local seafood on small, sharable plates.  Was blown away by a few menu items in particular:Oysters with JalepenoFluke with Japanese Plum, Cucumber, WasabiHamachi with Sesame Sumac (insanely great)Home made risotto, that night was crab, wow.
5	Super resto. Le serveur nous a offert en debut de repas de s'occuper du menu ce que nous avons accepte avec joie. Tous les plats servis "genre assiette tapas" etaient tres bons fait avec bcp de serieux. Je retournerai definitivement a ce resto tres bientot. Le seul petit bemol est que c'est un resto tres bruyant.
5	Great restaurant where you feel you're eating amongst locals. Tuna tartare and pecan desert were the highlight but everything else was amazing too. Staff were so friendly & helpful - the right balance between being there when you need them but also not making you feel uncomfortable. We were very lucky to get a table on Sat night having only called that day as long as we didn't mind eating at 10pm - for this quality & price - I'd do it all again & again !
4	What an insanely good restaurant. Not only the food presentation is amazing, but the taste is out of this world. I found that the portions were a little bit small for what the price, but overall, this is a grade A foodie experience.The salad with beets, avocado and tangerines was unbelievable, but what we preferred was the grilled octopus which was UN-BE-LIEVEABLE.
3	Mixed feelings. The apetizers were PER-FECT. Like, the best fish we had had in a loooong time. But then our second courses were so underwhelming it just didn't step up to the apetizers! It's quite pricey, too, because you need 5-6 plates to make it a dinner for two. I'm still pretty sure I will give it a second try just because the fish was so amazing.
3	Food is good, but I thought it was overpriced. The soups and salmon were delicious and wonderfully prepared.  However, the waiter gave me some attitude when I said we didn't want to do the chef's tasting, making the ordering process somewhat unpleasant.
5	Excellent and unique cuisine. we were four and everyone loved it!
5	We sat at the bar and proceeded to have one of the best meals of our trip to Montreal.  It was just the two of us so it was suggested by the very pretty brunette bartender to order 4 dishes to share since the menu was tapas style. So we shared the salad-scallops with avocado, orange and beet (so so good), then celery, foie gras, oyster, parmesan soup (amazing!), the cavatelli, foie gras, veal cheek (rich yumminess) and the sweetbread, lobster, squash gnocchi, porcini (oh so delish).  We finished it off with a maple syrup square, whipped cream, pecans (very nice).  The staff was excellent.  Best service, very attractive and very fun.  You need to go here!!!  Thank you Gilbert for the suggestion to dine at Le Filet!
3	I ate here summer of 13 and for a date meal it was a great dining experience that you have to try when visiting the city.  Petite portions are well made and very tasty.  They don't slap a bunch of sauces on their dishes. .typical french Canadian fare which is perfect.
5	Such a delicious meal!! Went there on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was packed. The food is served in small portions to share. We began with the tuna tartar and the hamashi. Both were great, but the tuna tartar was the best i have ever tried! For the entrees, we got 4 dishes: cavatelli with foie gras and veal cheek, mushroom tart, braised short ribs and shortbread with lobster and gnocchi porcini. Excellent restaurant, Will be back soon :)
4	Kelly and I had a late dinner there last night at 9:15 PM. The decor is very cool, with lots of black walls and mirrors in a very cool bar that we enjoyed sitting at for the evening. We had three appetizers and a couple of drinks and the cost was about $90. We had oysters, grilled octopus and hamachi.  All was excellent.
5	One of the best restaurant experiences I've had in awhile.Made a reservation for 8pm but arrived half an hour early and was still seated promptly. Ordered 6 oysters, originally wanted all 6 raw but our server strongly suggested trying at least 2 cooked so we did and will not regret one bit. Between my gf and I we had the Crab Risotto Shellfish Jus, Pork Flank Seared Scallop, Lobster Spaghetti, and Asparagus fresh from Quebec. And we ended the dessert with the Maple Syrup Square.All were great but what was exceptionally well was the Crab Risotto, Pork with Scallop, and the Maple Syrup Square. Great food and the service was just as great and attentive.
5	Amazing meal.  The dishes were inventive without being cloying or overly complicated. We had six seafood dishes each better than the last. They were all light but filling. I loved the tuna tartar, hamachi, and scallops min particular. Great atmosphere and service as well. Not cheap but worth it!
5	This is a great restaurant with very good service.   All the dishes were terrific.   We had the trout, squid, and many others.    We really like the manager patrick and our waitress Sarah Jane.    We had such a bad experience the night before we were so happy that Le Filet lived up to our expectations.
3	Food is top notch - cannot say anything negative here.Friends and other folks have been talking to me about this resto for some time and so why not! I know one of the part owners of this place through his previous undertakings in MTL and whatever he has done in the resto scene has worked extremely well.My only comment, and this marks the only reason why I am not providing 4 stars, pertains to the service. The service I received was a little lazy and  almost arrogant. I`m not typically one who will ask many questions in regards to a menu as I am well versed, however I do appreciate and welcome suggestions, and the like, especially when I know I will be forking out a nice amount of coin.When we actually did put forth our simple questions, we were provided with something to the effect, "well the chef is Japanese so all portions are small, figure it out"!  Haha, really? Was that meant to be funny?Food was great, and the wine I CHOSE, was divine. Cavatelli with foie gras and veal cheak is ridiculously good.Cheers.
5	Visiting Montreal from San Francisco, we were recommended to Les Filet by a local friend who understood how critical those in our home City can be of restaurants.  Well, you can put Les Filet up there with any spot in SF.  The food is creative, supremely well prepared and just fabulous.  The various shared sampler plates were a great way to try many different and delicious items.  We enjoyed a local wine (yes--a Quebec Chardonnay---Les Pervenche---you locals should check it out).  We especially enjoyed the vegetable dishes---most imaginative and the ingredients locally grown.And the service was abundantly friendly and helpful---thank you Audrey and co-owner Patrick.  In addition to being so friendly and inviting, they helped us navigate through an armada of Armagnac's and cognacs.  Many thanks!
5	This place was recommended by my roommate's brother, who recently visited this place with his fiancee. Naturally, we Yelped the place upon hearing it and checked out their menu on their website. The reviews were good, and the menu sounded delicious, hence we went ahead to call for reservations, considering it was a Saturday night (Open Table website wasn't accurate). Upon arriving, we were greeted pleasantly by the hostess and were shown to our table instantly. The restaurant looks very trendy with the open kitchen on the side. Our server proved to be knowledgeable on the menu as we did not know some of the ingredients. She proceeded to recommend some of her favorites and we went ahead with those recommendations. (All dishes are small plates and are recommended to be shared)Our meal for the night consist of: Oysters - both jalapeno and misoHamachi Crab RisottoGrilled Octopus Lobster spaghetti We started with oysters, both jalapeno and miso. Both very different flavors and both equally tasty. We were so impressed that we ordered another round of oysters. Either that, or we were both really hungry. The Hamachi was also delicious, equal balance between the fresh fish and the sesame seasoning. Again, we finished the plate wanting more, but we held ourselves back. The Lobster spaghetti was shared between us. Fresh lobster and light sauce on the spaghetti that doesn't over-power the dish itself. I had the grilled octopus for myself since my dining partner is less enthusiastic about the octopus than I am. The octopus was slightly over-cooked to my taste, slightly chewy, but unnoticeable. It was served on a tiny bed of Israeli couscous, personally I would prefer to have more couscous on the plate as it was very yummyThe crab risotto was all for my dining partner. I had a taste of it and it was very, very tasty. It can get a little bit heavy (since it's risotto). The crab is minced and mixed in the risotto, you can barely see it, but can definitely taste it. Service were impeccable. They probably changed our plates more times than necessary. Paying attention to tiny details such as making sure the restaurant logo sits 12 o'clock, directly on the top. Cleared our plates promptly. We also ordered bread on the side (no charge), which they accommodated us graciously. We did not order any drinks, so can't review the quality of their wines.
5	If you're looking for a romantic or trendy vibe, this is the perfect spot to be. Foodies rejoice! Le Filet is in an unassuming neighborhood - you would never suspect such a fine dining experience in the middle of what seems like a residential neighborhood. The second we walked in there we were treated like royalty - customer service is sublime here. Maybe because we brought our bachelorette decked out in bachelorette gear, but they were attentive and right on when it comes to making sure we got everything we needed, from bartender and water to plates and timing. Everything here is made to share, and they bring dishes out in waves, replacing your plates and utensils with each wave. It's really fantastic.In addition to a couple bottles of wine and a couple rounds of shots for the 7 of us, all of which were phenomenal, we ordered. The # of asterisks indicates how FANTASTIC the dish was, and how highly I would recommend it. But even the ones without asterisks were great compared to other restaurants, just picking out the ones that really stood out @ Le Filet.First Set:Scallops, Avocado, Beets, Orange Hamachi, Sesame Sauce, Sumac*Tataki of Wagyu, Eggplant, MisoTuna Tartare, Egg Confit, Nori Tempura**Second Set:Grilled Octopus, Israeli CousCous, Meyer Lemon CoulisSpaghetti, Lobster, Fresh Peas*Arctic Char, Quebec Asparagus, Parmesan Froth*Third Set:Pork Flank, Seared Scallops, Soft Polenta***Cavatelli, Foie Gras, Veal Cheek****Lamb Medallions, Tomato Jam, Chanterelles**
5	One of the best dining experiences ever for us. Started with Oysters (both preparations) then tuna tartare. Moved on to grilled octopus, linguine with clams and finished with scallops with pork shank. Not one thing we didn't love. Enjoy this place everyone.
5	Just left Le Filet and loved it!! We had the hamachi appetizer and the tuna tartare to start.  Both were delicious. Then followed by the crab risotto which was probably my favorite part of the meal. It was amazing. Then, we finished with the veal cheek cavatelli and venison dishes which were also yummy! Altogether highly recommended!
