4	I have visited the Nail Expo on Indian School Road a few times now. I always get the same person (her name escapes me right now) and she is very good. She has done manicures as well as eyebrow waxing for me and I find her to be a very good waxer. The manicures were not perfect, but very serviceable and lasted well. This is a more comfortable place than others I have been to and there isn't a constant upsell about everything. She was friendly and we talked about families and children with ease. If you are looking for a great, comfortable, not too upscale place that is dependable with good prices, this is it!
4	Walked in, not a great looking place, but we were greeted and seated quickly.  The ladies did a fabulous job!  If you are looking for something special, go elsewhere, but for a quick, good looking mani or pedi, come here!
4	I like them - I told my technician (Kim) that in the past my nails have not been shaped how I like them, no matter how many times I tell them.  I explained to her what I wanted and she did JUST THAT.  And, she remembered for the next time.  The prices are very reasonable, as well, so I plan to keep going back.
2	I have gotten mani pedis here before and they do a good job but I got acrylic for a wedding and although it looked nice when I left, they soon started to fall apart. After paying 25 plus tip I was hoping they would last longer.. They just were not made with love. I won't be getting acrylic here any longer.
