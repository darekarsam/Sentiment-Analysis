4	I got me some Paper denim jeans on sale here for $45, an English Laundry tee and some Donald J Pliner shoes for half off - and ever since I was hooked. Roka is a small mens/womens boutique in the Arrowhead AJ's shopping center - heavy on the denim with shirts, sweaters, belts and shoes.  The owners are friendly and offer guests water and candy when you're shopping (or maybe it's just me).   Every so often they'll have a steal of sale - including their denim sales in February.Who says you have to hoof it to Scottsdale for fancy duds?
4	I love going to Roka, especially when they have sales on Jeans.  They have a small very personal boutique with a great little variety of clothes that I usually love....my problem is not buying to much.  One year they had jean 50% off and I went nuts and bought 4-5 pair of designer jeans.  The shirts are always soft and cool looking.  I have not been by in a while but I need to since my clothing selection is depleting badly, worse than my bank account.

I didn't ever really think about my style and thought boutiques were really expensive and pretentious, not here. I felt really comfortable and am a lifelong fan of Roka. They have really cool shopping events and an app that's a loyalty program, social media even a "style idea" part that I can submit pieces I have purchased and like to wear together! So not only is this place current in what's going on in style, they're current in what's going on in tech.Men's department is even better these days. I hate waking into a place and seeing so much dedicated to women.As far as Boutiques in the Phoenix metro area, this one has been here a long time and continues to be on top of style.
