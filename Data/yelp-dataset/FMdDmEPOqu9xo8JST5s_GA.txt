5	I went in to have a cavity filled and literally experienced no pain.  I did not feel the shot that Dr Wolf gave me.  The staff was very professional and explained what was going on throughout the whole procedure.  I am recommending Majestic Dentistry to everyone I know!
5	I just wanted to say how courteous and knowledgeable the team at Anthem Majestic Dentistry is from the moment i walked in the door! I am also pleased with the expert knowledge of Dr. Wolf with his state of the art techniques, i never had a cancer screening as part of my routine checkup prior to Dr. Wolf. I also have a whitening program included in my visits that keep me on top of my supply whenever i go for a cleaning. I recommend Anthem Majestic Dentistry to anyone interested in the healthcare of their teeth, as i drive out of my way to go there! Thank you, Sandra Burns.
5	Dr. Frank Wolf delivers what he promises.  On time appointments (he is respectful of your time) and painless dentistry.  State of the art equipment, caring staff, and oh so Painless.  Today I had a lengthly procedure done and experienced no pain whatsoever.  I went to work afterward and expected some discomfort, but, much to my surprise, no pain of discomfort at all.  I have had dentists in the past that make you wait 30-40 minutes in the waiting room, and then seemingly rush you through a procedure.  But, Dr. Wolf takes time to explain what needs to be done, how long it will take and how much it will cost.  I am extremely satisfied with his manner and approach to dentistry.  No waiting, compassionate care, and quality dentistry.  I would highly recommend Dr. Wolf to anyone looking for a GREAT dentist.
