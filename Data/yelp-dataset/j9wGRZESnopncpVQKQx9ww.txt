3	Woohoo, we finally have a Popeye's again!! Popeye's is one of the best national fast-food fried chicken purveyors around. I'm partial to the bonafide or tenders orders. Sides of choice include cajun fries, mashed potatoes w.gravy and cajun rice. I really like the cajun fries. One of things that tickles my fancy is the pop machine. It's a touch screen interface where you can choose a wide variety of coke products (including a bunch of different flavors of fanta). Mix 'n match as you see fit.The store itself is an odd configuration. A ton of wide open space. The staff is friendly enough. But the wait can sometimes be a while, esp. right around closing time. And why are they not open late late night?At the end of the day, it's better fast food than most others but still fast food. Make sure you have good health insurance.
5	I'm so glad they put a Popeye's back in Pittsburgh but way did they have to put it in Oakland?.  The parking sucks to put it mildly and no handicap parking.  Pgh new retarded parking kiosk are the worst. .25 for 8 min and you have to go to the thing remember your plate number and then go back to put the tag in your window.  This is the stupidest thing ever invented.
2	My girlfriend and I decided to brave the freezing cold and stop by for some chicken  to warm us up. We both ordered a meal to go and began our wait at 1:07, id say about ten other people came in after us and ordered and received their meals before us. Come 1:34 we finally received our meal and had to sprint to my car so I would not get a ticket. I had thought to ask if the chicken I was eating was fresh butchered since it took so long. Anywho. I dont think ill be going back to this establishment. After the long wait. Our chicken/fries didnt even taste fresh.
