5	Dr B's patients are almost fanatical about him and for good reason. He cured a numb finger that had been bothering me for a YEAR. My reg doc did an x-ray and other diagnostic tests but couldn't figure it out. It ended up being a pinched nerve in my neck, and he fixed it in two visits. He tries hard to teach you how to avoid needing appointments, through exercises and other ideas to maintain back health. He's not trying to scam anyone into frequent treatments (a common accusation against chiropractors, though I've only seen it one time and it definitely wasn't here). I hesitate to write a positive review bc I don't want any more competition for appointments! But he's brilliant and I felt he deserved an honest review. :)
5	Dr. Trevor is the BEST chiropractor.  He is nice and informative.  He doesn't make you come back frequently which is optimal for me since I am not very compliant.  I have been his yearly patient for years, but now that I am older I do need to go back a little more often.  Go to him for a consult, you will be happy you did.
5	I was recommended to Dr. Berry as I have terrible migraine headaches. I have been going to him for a little over 2 months. He is VERY thorough in his knowledge! I had never heard of a chiro with emphasis in neurology. It made sense to get to the route of the reason for the headaches. I am so glad that I found him!
