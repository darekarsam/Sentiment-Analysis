5	I have been a Curly Girl my entire life. Except for one unfortunate incident that I would rather not discuss.I have been researching this Brazilian Blowout thing for quite a while and was a little scared. But I decided to go for it.I am SOOOOO HAPPY with it.  First of all, it didn't hurt and my hair didn't fall out. That should give you an idea about my previous experience.Katie explained everything, answered all my questions....and I had a lot of them. She styled it. And really gave me a tutorial on how to take care and style my new straight hair. I don't have to wear my hair pulled back anymore. it's shiny and soft.I NEVER thought I could have hair like this,EVER!!!!IF YOU ARE A CURLY GIRL, YA GOTTA TRY THIS, KATIE IS THE BEST.
5	Here to get my second Brazilian Blowout and a Color. Katie washed that gray right out ta my hair. I love how my hair looks and feels. I probably could have gone another couple of weeks before I straightened it again, but today fit right in my schedule. Katie is so accommodating.She does men and women! You know what I mean.THE BEST IN TOWN, SERIOUSLY PEOPLE!!
5	From service, price, personality, Katie is your girl! If you want it done right, go see Katie!!
