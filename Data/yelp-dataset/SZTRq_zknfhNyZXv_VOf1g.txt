3	This Getgo has a Redbox rental which I've made good use of.It's a gas station so there isn't much to report on. Most of my trips to this Getgo are made late at night and I do appreciate the business for staying open late.They sale Giant Eagle cookies and Hoagies and hot food items like sandwiches.
2	I love Get Go, great concept from hometown Giant Eagle, this one...not so much. First it's small, always crowded, very tiny parking lot which makes getting in and out, AND trying to pump gas turn into a hair pulling out experience. With only 7 pumps with regular gas and one with diesel and the mothercrackin' car designers who insist on putting the gas fill  on different sides of cars, weeeeeeelllllllll you see my point. bypass this one unless there's no one at the gas pumps when you arrive.
2	It's your standard gas station, not nearly as nice as the get go stations like the one in bridgeville. they do have the food counter inside, which is nice. the parking lot is crowded and the pumps are set up in such a way that really only one car can get in per side.   Getting in and out of the station is a legitimately difficult proposition as someone is usually parked right along side the street which completely limits visibility. in addition, that car will invariably have their lights on so now you're blind. Heaven help you if there's a truck making a delivery.
