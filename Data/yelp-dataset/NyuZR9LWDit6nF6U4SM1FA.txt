1	Took my 2013 jeep JKUR to get an AEV rear bumper/tire carrier. I sure had a big bag of extra parts when they finished. Maybe cause they didn't follow the instructions. Also tried charging me an extra hour of labor, but I was there the whole time and knew when they started working on it. Wish yelp add a negative star system.
4	I'm a big fan of the guys here.  They run a little shop and they like what they do.  I knew my catalytic converter was going bad (it was rattling).  I wanted a high-flow cat and a new muffler.  They knew what I was looking for because they know Jeeps.  I've been there countless times for all sorts of repairs.  Recently they fixed my driveshaft too.  Make no mistake, this isn't a luxury car repair place.  It helps if you know a little bit about your vehicle before you go.  And no, there isn't a waiting room.  So, go walk around China town.  It's a great place.
5	I took my Jeep here because I heard their prices were better than others in town and that they got the job done faster....so I went with an open mind. All I can say is Jake and his team got me and my Jeep back on the road lickity split and for hundreds less than I was quoted at other places. Thanks Jake....Y'all rock!!!
5	I've been going to these guys for years! I have a 2000 TJ wrangler with 4" lift, big tires and loaded. Jake is awesome. Just had a big job done, tie rods AND ball joints... They quoted me $400 less than a competitor... No hassle price! They really know their stuff. I came back from tahoe to get work done here because tahoe quoted me much more and were not jeep specific! I may be a girl, but I know vehicles!!! And other places always try to bulsh!t me thinking I know nothing until I correct them and throw out some auto lingo. Back Country Parts is just awesome and stress free.
