5	Real Homemade Greek Cusine.  Moderate Price, however nice portions.  I had the Gyro Special with Fries and a drink for about $6.00.  I also had the Humus plater, of course with the fried pita bread, a must in my opinion.  Friendly staff, CLEAN, and the only restaurant in the Mall that I know of that gave FREE refills.
4	Great lunch spot!  Love the Gyro and the Pita Chips!
4	This was my first visit to Plaza Fiesta and it was great.  This Greek place is good considering the price.  I had a gyro, greek salad, and some hummus and was very satisfied!
4	Out of all the eateries in this mall, Bravo is my second favorite. Second because I have a soft spot for real Mexican food which the Mexican eatery in there offers. But no other eatery in the food court comes close to Bravo. The staff is always very friend and willing to recommend items or things that will go well with your order. Their pitas and gyros are excellent.But the real reason why you want to go to Brave is their fried pita bread chips. I've never seen this anywhere else and those chips are insanely good with Tzatsiki. That's it. You need to know NOTHING else. Get off your butt, go to Bravo and order fried pita bread chips with Tzatsiki. NOW!
