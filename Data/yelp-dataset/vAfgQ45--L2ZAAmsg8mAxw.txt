5	I came here this morning for a one hour body scrub/massage session and was so glad I did.  Groupon has been most helpful in introducing me to some fine beauty practitioners in the city at reasonable prices and today's experience did not disappoint.  A side note: a body scrub is a FULL body scrub....as in, you are completely nekkid for the treatment.  For some reason, that fact didn't occur to me, but thanks to years of being in the performing arts and being around performers, I'm not that modest.  :)Violeta has been working as an aesthetician since 1992 and is originally from Romania.  I found her to be charming and soft-spoken and appreciated her laid-back demeanor.  She started by applying a papaya body oil all over my body, then scrubbed me all over with special gloves.  Violeta then followed the scrubbing with hot, damp towels; she placed the towels over different parts of my body, then stroked off the scrub remnants.  Lastly, she gave me a full body massage.Violeta actually worked out a few knots in my neck; I was so happy that I booked another session with her for after the holidays.If you want some pampering, I highly recommend her.
5	I purchased a deal online for a "back facial and massage" with Violeta and was very pleased. It was a very relaxing, pleasant experience and Violeta herself was so nice. Her little treatment area was calming and soothing, and Violeta seemed very knowledgeable and friendly. Overall a great experience, I will definitely be returning at some point.
5	Hands down best facial I've ever had. She was very educated as well as extremely sweet. I would recommend her to anyone.
5	Great Lady and Great atmosphere. Extremely relaxing Hot Stone Massage.. Highly recommended!
