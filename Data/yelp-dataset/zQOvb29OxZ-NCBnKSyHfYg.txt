5	I have gone to University Eye Associates for a few years now and I will keep going back - a very friendly staff and and even friendly set of doctors has always been there for everything I need.  I had an allergic reaction in my right eye this past week and they fit me in to their schedule and got me setup with drops and new lenses within 24 hours...that's the kind of service I expect out of my eye doctor!  I believe they are moving to 485 and Rocky River Rd. at the end of the year, so if you are looking for this practice in the future, the address may have changed.
1	The worst !  Brookdale Drive - Rocky River....Always trying to get you to do another eye exam.  Took in my son's new prescription in June to make sunglasses. They wanted to do another eye exam today. They said it had been 2 years since last eye exam.  I explained to them -  I brought in the new prescription in June and you used it on his sunglasses.  The lady kept arguing. My son walked out. I called and finally had to hang up. Also, one other time I told them only an eye exam  not the doctor exam (due to diabetes) they went ahead and did the doctor exam after I was very clear with them not to do a doctor's exam. Had to have them take it off.  My husband's eye exam that was done here was wrong too. Had to pay to have another eye exam. Going elsewhere... Brookdale is the worst for customer service.Let me add:  Received a call from the manager, December this morning and she said my son did not tell them that he had sunglasses made in June.  I told her, yes he did and so did I on the phone.  I told December that they need to look in the computer and her reply was:  "thank you for that tip".   Another unprofessional smart mouth.  All this could have been avoided if they knew how to use their computers.  Need some training in customer service too.
