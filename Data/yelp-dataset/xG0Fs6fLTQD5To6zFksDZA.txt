1	I have never actually submitted a review before but because my experience was so bad, I figured I should warn you...do NOT do business with this company. I purchased a Living Social Deal and when they missed my appointment with no call, I called the company and was yelled at by Jamie and told they wouldn't service my home. Thankfully Living Social stands behind their customers and they gave me a full refund. My recommendation is to find another service provider.
1	Well.  Seems I'm not the only one who had an issue with this company.  I also purchased a Livingsocial deal, made an appointment and the appointment was called and rescheduled on the day they were supposed to show.  Got a call on the day of the second rescheduled appointment.  This time, I put in for a refund with Livingsocial.  Would you believe that I received a call the day after the company was supposed to show asking me how service went?  The deal was marked "used" BY THE COMPANY.  I'm going to file a BBB complaint against Advanced Air if I don't get my money back.
