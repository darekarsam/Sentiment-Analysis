4	A few major blocks off the strip but the distance served my needs. The rooms were spacious and clean.The free Wifi is a definite plus.  It didnt go off and on like some other hotels I've experienced.
4	Very new modern hotel. Room clean and smells fresh. Front desk staff was professional and attentive.
4	Always a good experience.  Friendlyy service and a great price
3	The front desk staff are super nice and go out of their way to be helpful and kind. Unfortunately, though, they can't make up for physical realities. The hotel itself has grown a bit rough around the edges since it was refurbished in the new HIE style several years ago. The pillows on my bead were clumpy, the shower drain clogged and the bed not as firm as it once was. But all this pales before the new LV take off route which sends planes overhead beginning from 6 AM until about 9 or 10 PM. They don't fly by thick and furious but often enough to ruin a morning's sleep.  Ah, well. It was good while it lasted.
3	This is a nice mid-range HI Express off of the main drag but near enough to MacCarran to make it convenient for business travel. There are a decent number of restaurants and gas bars nearby to grab a meal at or gas up your rental car on your way back to the airport (and avoid that gouging gas bar by the rental car centre). If this is in your hotel network and you aren't a fan of the strip (I'd rather be in the mountains) I definitely recommend it.
5	Very nice and clean. I like the staff friendly and good service. I Iike the morning breakfast. My family member like to stay here whenever they visit me.
