5	First time renting at this location. Fast friendly staff answered all my questions. Dolores was awesome!!! She tuned the viola, made sure everything was ok with it before I left. Got two months free as well as a free care kit.
5	I love this place. I've always found the staff cheerful and well informed.
5	I bought my violin here more than ten years ago and have made several visits since. The shop is small but cozy, the large amount of music books gives the place an atmosphere reminiscent to a library's. The staff are always friendly, very accommodating, and seem to genuinely care for the instruments that come through the door. It is always a pleasure to walk in and a comfort to know my old friend will be well cared for.
4	My experience with Violin Outlet is a positive one. When my son's school had their little "rental fair," there were several businesses present to offer their services. The school cafeteria was crowded with fancy displays of intimidating instruments and pushy staff. Violin Outlet was not that way at all. Their staff was very approachable, knowledgeable, and overall helpful. They have continued to be friendly throughout my business relationship (renting their equipment) and have met all of my son's needs.
