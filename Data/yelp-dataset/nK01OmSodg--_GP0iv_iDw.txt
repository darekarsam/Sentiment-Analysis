5	New to Las Vegas and went to Lisa. She did a great job and she doesn't try to over charge you like many places in Las Vegas. I will def keep coming back:)
5	Easy to work with, she went to the shop with me to get hair. Her prices are excellent. She's flexible with hours of availability. Lisa it's been a while, hope your doing fine!
5	Lisa is a beautiful soul! She does works of magic and honestly I can say it CHANGES PEOPLES LIVES! Her suggestions were great and I had a wonderful time chatting with her during our whole session. She's very reasonable with her pricing and I can definitely say I will be coming back not only for the amazing service but also for the conversation! I walked out of her private salon feeling like a completely transformed person, much more confident due to my amazing extensions, styling, & cut!
