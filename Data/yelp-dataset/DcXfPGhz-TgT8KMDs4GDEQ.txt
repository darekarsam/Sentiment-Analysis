5	One of the Best bands you'll ever see. Their 80s set is amazing and will take you back to that time without a doubt. Robbie is such a great musician and without a doubt a leader among musicians. Go see them ASAP.
5	A friend and I just happened to be at the Hard Rock and saw that Vinyl had a live band and no cover. Works for me! We weren't sure what to expect, but Empire Records was AWESOME! They are great musicians and vocalists and sang all the fun 90s songs we all know. Very entertaining. So much so, that we went to Fremont Street just to see them a couple of months later!
5	Love them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love that they do every genre of the 90s.
