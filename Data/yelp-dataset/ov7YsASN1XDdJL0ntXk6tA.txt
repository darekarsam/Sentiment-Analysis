5	Super friendly staff (Brittany) and great food...I'm especially fond of their wings, which are always big, juicy, and perfectly cooked.  The "Jersey Shore" is my favorite variety so far.
1	Horrible place to go.. It's small and the locals act as if they own the bar. The bathrooms are dirty and the bar isn't that clean. The owner doesn't act like much of an owner, he is very immature and gets drunk with his patrons. Would not recommend at all!
1	I didn't even want to give this place a star. The bartenders were drunk. Clearly drunk. Doing shots with patrons. The old hag that did end up greeting us didn't even ask for our drink order just kind of stared at us in a drunken stupor. Luckily the other bartender grabbed our order and gave it to the clearly drunk bartender who rolled her eyes right in front of us. Rude as hell. Sorry I don't care how good the food is the service is shit.
5	This is pretty much the only bar i go to. Small but drinks are good its an everyone knows your name kinda bar. Its pretty much locals. Good people.
5	A friend and I stopped here for some appetizers. We noticed that it looked really small from the outside but it wasn't that small when we walked in. We both got Mac n cheese bites which were excellent! I also got the pierogies which was good. She got a  order of bacon cheese fries which was huge! The bartender was extremely nice and the regulars at the bar were too.
