4	I went to Performance based upon referral from Clint at Maximum Offroad.  I had a Dynomax cat back that I needed to be installed.  They took care of it in short order.including dealing with the after market hitch on my Jeep.  Good work at a decent price.
5	Amazing!! Called all over the valley for honest and nice people to fix my car, not only did they do just that they didn't rape me in charges. Will most def return if need be
