5	I've been going to Depont Salon and Spa since it opened. I live in N. Phoenix, but the service and quality are worth the 30 minute drive. You can definitely tell that Katie, the owner, takes a lot of pride in her salon. It's always spotless. There's a wide selection of high quality nail colors to choose from. Katie has great taste in choosing colors. Her staff is always helpful and welcoming. She and her staff are incredibly knowledgeable.
