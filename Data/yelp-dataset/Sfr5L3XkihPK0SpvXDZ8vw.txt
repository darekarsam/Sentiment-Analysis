5	Usually not too busy. I have been coming here for years. They just changed their name so they have great grand opening deals. I love their spa chairs and they offer a lot with a basic pedi for a fair price. I love bringing my daughter cause they have mini spa chairs and she can get a mini mani/pedi. The staff is very friendly and remember you when you come in.
1	I went into the salon for a manicure and pedicure. What a disaster. The lady who tended to me did not do a very good job. The paint job was shotty. She only covered part of the nail leaving the sides exposed. The product she used was bad as it peeled within hours of service. the paint on my hands peeled in full sheets. I went back and two of them argued in their language and then decided to charge me full price to fix. on my third and final return I spoke to owner, owner claims that nail polish only last one to two days. poor excuse but still mine only lasted hours. The nails were uneven with some pointed some square and some rounded. Shish never again. If you go to this salon ask for the male owner he does a good job but stay away from the new employees. They just don't care.
5	The two times that I came here I have had a really good experience.They do a really neat and thorough job and my nails always turn out great. They will accommodate any requests for color/designs. Prices are reasonable as well.
