4	Good place to go to at reasonable prices.   I have found their fish is excellent for an Italian restaurant.  Pasta dishes tend to be a bit heavy.  Would give 5 stars,  but service here can be a hit or miss proposition.  Sometimes very good,  sometimes slow with the serving staff very confused.
2	I suppose that's what you can expect for the very reasonable prices. Food heavy on fat, light on taste, and cavernous decor.Good for a group looking to eat quality food on the cheap, but not for much else.
4	Nice place to visit, and eat some Italian food.  In my short business stay in Montreal I stumbled by this place as I searched for a place to eat at since there's nothing to do around this area other than the Olympic Stadium, and the Stadium of the Impact MLS team.  Well, the food was good, and the service was great for me.  I know that a prior comment stated that the place was a hit, and miss when it came to their service...I might have come on the good day!  lol!  I would personally recommend this place if you're in the area.  :)
3	Basically this place is a slightly posher Pacini's.They have better escargot though and their soups are also more palpable.Stay clear from the veal with lemon sauce (Uch!).Not bad, not amazing, will probably end up here again (if we don't  feel like Pacini) since it's close by and the prices aren't  bad.
