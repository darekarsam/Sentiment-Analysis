1	Do not use this dental office, unless you want to be overcharged. Their prices are higher than most dental offices in town. Not only are their prices higher...they give their patients skewed approximations of what insurance will cover and what the patient will have to pay. Also the office will try and upsell you left and right on many additional features that are unnecessary. They also try and spread out the visits to receive more payments from insurance companies as well. One day x-rays. Next week cleaning. Despite the higher prices, I had a couple of cavities taken care of at this office because the staff seemed nice and professional, and two weeks after my cavities were fixed, I received a call from the office staff telling me I owed over $600 in additional to the $400+ I had already paid. Their estimate was approximately 70% off of what they had originally stated insurance would cover. What BS. I've heard of estimates being a little off, but not by over 70%. If you are looking for a dentist, find another. There are many high quality dentists in Scottsdale. AVOID THIS OFFICE.

1	This review is not for the dentist, but rather for the nasty receptionist.Dr. Vander Schaaf was rather a sweet mid-aged lady and her hygienist was really sweet too.But,... Heather or Betty? its been like 8-9 months since I've been here I still remember how displeased I was by the experience with the receptionist I stopped going back after two visits.She was so rude and disrespectful of my time, I was outraged and eventually found another dentist. She was not helpful with scheduling my appointments around my work schedule to say the very least.
5	I found the office to be quite lovely, up-to-date and "new."  The staff, all the way from the front desk to the hygienist to Dr. Vander Schaaf to be very personable and friendly.  My teeth are very sensitive and I was quite nervous for my first in office teeth whitening.  My teeth really hurt after whitening with over-the-counter that I get at the store, and was therefore pleasantly surprised at how painless it was. Be prepared for it to take two hours, but well worth the time spent.  Very reasonably priced and just a lovely staff.  Would definitely recommend this office.
