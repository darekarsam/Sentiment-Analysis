4	Went there after a terrible experience at Dick's. I needed some football gear for my son and the people there were terrific and knowledgeable about their products.
5	Love M C Sports!  Great prices, good sales, friendly staff, good product selection.  Did I mention helpful staff?  Sometimes there is low employee coverage but hey if you happen to be there when there is a forcasted slow period you will still get what you want.  M C Sports it is where you go for good prices, friendly staff and great sales.
5	We have been going to MC Sports for ski equipment for a few years now. Service is excellent, the staff is always very knowledgable and helpful. We recently picked up some ski boots for my 13 yr old daughter, they did a great job fitting the boots and the price was fantastic, on sale for $99 when Chalet Ski up the street charges $170 for the exact same boot. Highly recommend them.
4	If you need something "sporting", do NOT forget to check with MC Sports.  I've shopped here for a while and have found numerous deals that other big-box sporting goods stores wouldn't bother to offer.  When I need shoes (for me or the kids), this is a must-shop store - their clearance shoes are great and priced to move.  Recently, I went shopping here on Black Friday (in the afternoon - I'm not crazy).  It wasn't horribly busy, and they still had most of the items I was looking for.  I was able to grab a bunch of good deals without fighting a mob.  I had to come back the next day for some returns, exchanges, and to grab some basketball shoes on clearance for my older son.  They were super helpful in making everything happen for me without much fuss.  The shoes I got were better than the ones I had picked up earlier at Shoe Box - and they were $10 less.  Can't beat that!So please, shop around - check out Dick's Sporting Goods and all the other places, but keep MC Sports on your list - they may surprise you!
