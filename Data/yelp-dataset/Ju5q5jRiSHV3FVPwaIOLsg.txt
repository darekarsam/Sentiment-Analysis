4	Charming new korean resto near Cote-Vertu metro. Food taste amazing and friendly service.
4	My husband and I love to go there. The food is always good and the dishes are always well display.The service is a little slow but the staff are so friendly.I definitely return again!
5	Amazing place!They opened last year and we've been going there regularly for lunch ever since. The owner's Korean and it is definitely authentic Korean food. Everything on the regular menu is just super yummy but beware, the lunch "box" is not at all authentic Korean and it's actually pretty bad compared to the rest of the amazing menu but I guess it works for some people as most of my colleages get it when we go there.Service is great but it can be a bit slow.Decor is nice and the whole place is completely renovated.
1	The food is good but they did the unthinkable! Ordered rice and pork, didnt finish it so asked for take out, the man took in to the back and I saw him transfer the food into the takeout box with his bare hands!! No bueno!
4	If wanting to eat Korean food an you are not willing to go to downtown area? You should consider coming here! The decor is appealing, and has a bit of a chic vibe to them ( they went with the all white theme) I orders bimbimbap which was a monstrous portion and came with sides dish ( potato, Asian strong beans and vegetable ) and with miso soup! All for 11.35$ this place also had BBQ which really convenient considering there also a college near by.
