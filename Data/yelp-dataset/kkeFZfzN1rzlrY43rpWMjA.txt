2	This location is ALWAYS out of stock on items. It's disorganized, messy, and frankly...behind on the times. I love Target, but I'm really starting to get burnt out on this spot.
4	This is an older location, but Target is Target nonetheless.They always seem to have what I am looking for (or not looking for..you always end up buying something you didn't intend on) and the shelves seem to always be stocked. The employees are nice and always say hello or ask if you need help. There are usually a couple registers open during non-busy times, and anytime I have been there when it has been busy, the lines move quickly.This location isn't as nice as Tempe Marketplace or the store on Longmore but it's close to where I live, the parking lot isn't terribly annoying, and I know that I will be able to get what I need at a decent price.
2	Big lines always 2 registers open an its laborDay weekend 15 min to buy 2 things !!! An how hard is it to do a price check at this store when the product is rite there REALLY!!!
3	This Target is not fantastic and not horrible. It has what other targets have, but sometimes low on stock on things. I feel like if they were to get more products they will do a lot better. The thing that I noticed since living in the area and coming to this Target that it ALWAYS has someone trying to steal from this place. Sad but true. Sure this happens at any store, but its so crazy how it happens every time i decide to come out to this one! Don't get me wrong, I love that this is close by and is easy to get to. Though, i feel that if the surrounding area builds up this target will probably up their game and do better in the future. Will be coming back again because its close, but will be watching my back each time i shop lol! Good luck Mesa, Target!
