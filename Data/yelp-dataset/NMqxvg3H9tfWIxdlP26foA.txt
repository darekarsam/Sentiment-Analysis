1	Terrible nail salon, don't go there!Went there because I had a gift card and got the gel polish. They had very few colors to begin with and the heating lamp was disgusting and looked not clean, one lamp was turned off and then they wondered why the nail polish on my thumb wouldn't get hard and smeared and they had to fix it. They were trying to save energy by only having one lamp on!!! When I came back a few weeks later to get my gel polish removed I had to put my hands for about 15 minutes in acetone, way too long in such a smelly liquid. Then the guy scratched my polish off with his own fingernails rather than using a tool. It was very unpleasant to say the least and paying $ 5.-- for that is absolutely ridiculous.Needless to say I won't go back there ever!!!!!!!
5	David & Elaine are great. I've tried many different nail salons but I always come back to the best place in Steele Creek!
4	Awesome service. May not look like much from the outside but the older man who did my gel polish did amazing and he was so so nice. Very impressed and will certainly be back.
1	I will NEVER return to this establishment for my manicure. The service was very poor. I also witnessed one of the nail technicians (male) yelling at a customer. Very unprofessional and rude.
