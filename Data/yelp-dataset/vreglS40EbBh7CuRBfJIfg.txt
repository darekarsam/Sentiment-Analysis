5	GREAT GREAT and awesome service! You can't find a single thing on the menu that isn't wonderful. One of the best burgers in all of Vegas. Prices quiet reasonable especially in a resort and they do room service!! Everyone there is friendly and happy to serve you. Another special treat the owner sometimes comes in he is friendly and seems to really enjoy his employees and his customers!! If in Vegas and haven't been at least once or thrice .... YOU need to make Scotty Bean's a stop at the Grandview timeshares next to Southpoint Casino
5	Great service and just what I ordered. Fries were perfectly cooked extra crispy just as I had asked. Quick delivery to my room.
2	I've try calling them, to order for pick up and the phone kept ringing and ringing, so I decided to walk there, and found out that the phone was off the hook on purpose so the phone won't ring, I've waited for 30 minutes for a salad, worse service ever!!
