5	I have seen A LOT of chiropractors in my life, and experienced pretty much any type of adjustment out there, but my best experience by far has been with Dr. Llaca. She is knowledgeable and does adjustments based on your physical needs NOT a cookie cutter adjustment that she gives to everyone who walks in the door. If you want to feel better, AND have your opinion respected by a doctor, Dr. Llaca is your chiropractor.
5	Dr. Llaca took great care of me on my road to recovery from a back injury. Her knowledge, personable demeanor, and holistic approach to whole body health has me back to 100%. Not only did she lead me back to health but she also taught me preventative actions to take to ensure it doesn't happen again.
5	I have been to many a chiropractor all across this country but Dr. Llaca is definitely the best in the business. Scottsdale is lucky to have her. She is not your typical chiropractor who asks a a series of questions and then proceeds to crack your body sending you on your way with an ice pack and some " special" creme in the end. Dr. Llaca knows what she is talking about for the body, mind, soul both physically and nutritionalyl to yield the maximum results one is desiring from chiropractic care. She is knowledgeable in so many aspects of chiropractic care and beyond. WhenI was diagnosed with celiac disease, she  changed focus on areas that helped me relieve some of the discomforts associated with the early changes of the disease I experienced. I see Dr. Llaca on a regular basis and I am so glad that I do. She has changed not only the mobility of my body, but the sharpness of my mind, my health and spirits. Go see her in Scottsdale today.
5	I had never been to a chiropractor before but my back ache was debilitating. One visit to Dr. Llaca I was amazed at how much  better I felt. I now go on a regular basis and I must say my back aches are a thing of the past. I feel better all over and even have more energy. Thank you and why did I wait so long.
