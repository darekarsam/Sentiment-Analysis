4	"Eggs are eggs." said Georges Costanza. He was no genius but he was right.Their "sunny side ups" are as good as any others. Nothing to fancy about really. The staff deserves all the stars. Along came the waitresses. Friendly, accessible and courteously warm.Nothing hipsters will blog about, but an absolute comfortable joint for brunch.
