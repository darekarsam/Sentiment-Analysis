4	I moved to Scottsdale in November and had to find a dentist for myself, my husband and two boys.  I tried Dr Lerma's office in Pinnacle Peak (NE Scottsdale) because of a free offer card I got in the mail and because it was close to my house.  The office is very nice, receptionist has been consistently polite and helpful and I got an appointment easily.  Dr. Lerma is friendly and competent and thorough.  I hate going to the dentist but have managed with her and they've been very sympathetic to my nerves and anxiety.  I did have to have some fillings replaced and it went off without a hitch.  My husband and kids like her too, and since then some of my colleagues have tried her out as well and are happy.

As I'm getting my teeth cleaned from a super dental hygienist who did everything to be accommodating to me (I don't like the X-ray part) I can hear doctor greeting everyone else and cheerfully examining her other patients. For new patients they were running a special for free whitening (yes!) so when I returned the next day she checks in on every bay every time even if you aren't there to see her. Awesome atmosphere. I have recommended to several people all ready. I saw a little kids corner where they get gifts after their examination which was super cute. I'm so pleased with my cleaning and whitening services!!!
5	My wife and I switched to Dr. Lerma a few years ago, and we absolutely love her and her staff.  Getting an appointment is easy, and she has been very receptive to emergency appointments.   The staff is friendly and knows every patient by name and mouth (LOL).  I am not a youngster, and Dr. Lerma understands that my dental needs are different from younger folks.  She is thorough and affable.
