3	Free wifi, tasty coffee and lovely light croissants made for a life-saving stop for little old me today at Plougastel. I will come back on the weekend to try the lemon rye bread and the Plougastel itself and to smile again at the friendly team of people who populate the place and sling hot baguette. There is some pretty design inside (stone archway indoors, of course) but somehow this cafe still feels a little cold and uninviting - hard chairs, cement floor, white walls... So I wouldn't come here to cozy up, but for some emergency internet and delicious snacks I'll keep keeping Plougastel in mind.
2	I used to come here nearly every day to work (finishing a dissertation). Pastries are very good, decent food, coffee is better than acceptable, and everything at excellent prices. There's free wi-fi. The staff is warm. Decent music at a reasonable volume. Local art on the walls. Nice place.BUT... the owner prefers to leave the door open--even when it's wet and cold (as in 2 degrees) outside. The bathroom is dirty, and the main floor doesn't seem to get swept very often. Also, the owner has become sarcastic and unpleasant of late. I can no longer recommend this place, except as an place to grab inexpensive pastries for carry-out. So, good for carry-out, but you're taking your chances if you choose to eat in.
4	Better then average coffee;no soy/almond milk or other types of milk, so a bit of a downfall for me ,only regular milk, BUT coffee quality is great. Latte was creamy, and delicious. I also had a Brie and tomato sandwich on a baguette, the touch of the tomato acid made the Brie taste better. Free Wifi, nice little tables by a large window so you can sit looking outside boulevard Saint-Laurent. Friendly staff.
