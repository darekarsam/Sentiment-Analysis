4	not sure which one i hit up but there are many small groceries like this that carry a wide variety of fresh produce for cheaper than the large supermarkets. i got almost everything i needed except for the curry powder cos i don't feel like making it from scratch. the sales lady was very nice!
3	This is a neighborhood fruit and vegetable store, which also has a selection of other food items, including an extensive cheese and cured meat counter, Premier Moisson bread. To me Val-Mont is the best of many such fruit and vegetable stores along Mont-Royal Ave. There is another Val-Mont further west, which is a little better than this one.One complaint: stick to the fruits and vegetables. Hamel cheese shop is right down the block, along with Maison de Roti butcher, and a brand new full service Metro supermarket. So why is Val-Mont trying to do everything?
4	This is a great little neighborhood fruit and vegetable store. They don't have everything, but they have enough.
