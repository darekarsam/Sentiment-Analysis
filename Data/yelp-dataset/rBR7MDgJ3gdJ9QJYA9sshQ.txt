1	Went in for a perm and the people were very rude. It is in a hidden out of the way location. Maybe the chain headquarters put it there on purpose. Hide the worst people in an area where no one will visit!
5	Great place with a great staff, they were fun and professional. Yes the salon is tucked in the corner but its right behind the water n ice.
5	I've been going here for a year and a half. Over the past 5 months, at least one person per day has asked where I but my hair. Over the past year and a half, it's at least one person/week who asks. I'm so happy to have this great go-to for my layering. They're consistent, friendly, and affordable. I've even sent my mom and one of my best girlfriends here and they both loved it! Definitely come here - even if you're not sure what you want. They're suggestions are fantastic.
