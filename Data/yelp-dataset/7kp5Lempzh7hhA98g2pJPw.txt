5	Rick was as nice a person as you could hope for. Nothing corporate or impersonal about this local car rental agency. Great cars, warm customer service.
5	I rented a 2014 Corvette Convertible for the day from Rick to see if I wanted to purchase one.  The day was perfect for riding out in the canyons and valleys with the top down.  The car was spotless and Rick is a real car guy like many of us.  I just wanted to pass along my great experience with Rick.
5	Rick is awesome! Rented a 2014 Corvette Stingray for my wedding and it was a blast. I still dream of driving that thing on the 101.  Thank you!
5	Very well run business.  Rick was incredibly easy to work with, and offered us a great rental at a great price.  Highly recommend.
5	Rick,Thank you so much for all that you've done. You're a stand up guy and I hope to come back to Arizona again to rent another vette. That c7 stingray stole my heart, I'm definitely buying one now. The attention it brought and the excitement was great. I'm still smiling when I think about being behind the wheel of that iconic exotic car. Everyone should know that if you ever have the interest in driving this car that Rick at rent a vette should be your number one go to person. Will definitely be renting again, can't wait to make it back to Scottsdale again. Sincerely,Matt
