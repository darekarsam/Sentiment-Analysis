4	I liked this place very much. It is your basic, no frills strip mall nail shop-but for $25 I got a nice spa pedi, complete with callous scrub and hot towels-which is something that these other rip-off nails salons charge extra for once you sit down and it's too late. My pedi lasted a long time and they were super friendly. I would most definitely go back! Thanks ladies! (and 1 gentleman) :)
5	I went in just for a spa pedi & mani. The price was pretty decent for Vegas, (in CA I can get a spa mani & pedi for $20). A few weeks back I tried another nail shop , Nail TK on lake mead, and was really unsatisfied w/ my pedi. Anyways, so I wanted to try a different place. I came here and was very pleased. Nail TK charged me extra for the scrub, hot towel & massage. Here it was all included in the price & they did a really great job. The gentleman that helped me out, I believe his name was Phoung. Both my toes & nails look & feel great. When I go back in 2 weeks I'll probably try out their gel & have them do a design. He said designs were his specialty ;-).
5	Got my wife a gift certificate for her birthday and she loved it. She didn't have a nail person since leaving Cali so she needed to find one she liked. Lucky she found Emma and did a great job.
