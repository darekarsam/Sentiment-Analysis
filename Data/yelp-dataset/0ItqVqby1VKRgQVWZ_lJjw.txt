4	For a food truck, this is damn good Thai. I'm not saying it's comparable to anything you may get at a few of the choice places around Charlotte, but it rings all the right bells. Pud ThaiDrunken NoodlesPud See EwVeggie springs rolls (These are effing amazing. That tangy tamarind sauce is legit)The menu is simple and only has about 5 entree choices. I'm sure they rotate, but would probably remain simple. I went with the Pud See Ew -- #2 spicy. While it was quite delicious, the spice factor was nowhere to be found. I should have gone with somewhere in the range of a #7. Those spring rolls? Seriously. Get them. You get 10 for $7. Though they are small, they are perfect for sharing between two people. Since it's Thai, and they are making orders as the tickets roll in, it takes a while. Guess that's the biggest commonality for Food Truck Friday, though, yeah?I'd order from these dudes again in a heartbeat. Good stuff. Plus, the guy at the window wears a sweet fedora. *tips hat in recognition of good style*Carry on!
5	Tried this truck at sleepy poet and its the best REAL Thai food I've had in Charlotte super friendly and clean. I'm now a forever fan
4	Being a Thai virgin, I wasn't really sure about what to get and I remembered the Pad Thai dish... When I say the flavors were insane, I mean that as the best compliment ever... The peanut flavor didn't overwhelm the rice noodle and there was a generous helping of chicken inside... The bean sprouts were nice and crunchy and I appreciated the extra helping of chopped peanuts on the side as well...I asked for super spicy and they gave me a great amount of heat... Not too much and not too little... Just enough to almost make me cough, but not enough to fall over...The lady taking the orders was very nice and prices were reasonable, in my opinion... I'll be back for sure...
