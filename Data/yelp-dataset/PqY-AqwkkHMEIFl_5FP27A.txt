4	I really like Pub Victoria for their beer selection, and proximity to my office in the Old Port of Montreal.  There is a limited liquor selection, so only go here if you are in the mood for a beer.Food wise, their prices are on the high end for what you get.  But due to the locality of the bar in relation to the old port of Montreal, of course the prices are going to be high.  I especially like the 5-7 special where you save a whopping $0.40 per beer...cheap asses.  But, hey, they have a great selection of beer not common in Montreal.They also have a large patio (aka terrace in Canada), where you can sit outside and enjoy your pub fare and spirits.
1	I am in Montreal for a couple days for meetings (the company I work for is based here) ... I flew in this afternoon. I didn't feel like going too far for supper and came across Pub Victoria on Rue Notre Dame Ouest. I like pubs and it looked interesting from the outside. It wasn't too busy when I got there about 5:30pm but a few people wandered in as I was there. I started with cheese sticks ... nothing outstanding about them. They arrived very quickly after I ordered them (too quickly) so I'm assuming they'd been made ahead of time. There wasn't a lot of choice on the menu so I ordered a burger and fries. Not great. The fries were overdone and it seemed like the burger was warmed up rather than cooked freshed for me. My server was efficient but a tad cold. I won't be back.
3	Perfectly fine for a 5a7 (happy hour), but nothing that special about it. Typical pub range of beer and liquor.
