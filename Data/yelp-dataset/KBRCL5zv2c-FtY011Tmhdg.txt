4	I stopped in for a quick lunch this afternoon while wandering around South Side. It was quiet in there, just me and one other customer who left shortly after I came in. The service was very friendly and quick. It took me a while to decide what to order, as there were so many different combinations of hot dogs and toppings on the menu. I eventually settled on a hot dog with pulled pork on top. A couple of minutes later, I was provided with a hot dog piled high with sweet pulled pork and barbecue sauce. Yum! The hot dog itself was fine, nothing spectacular, though I think I recall it being an all beef hot dog though, which is less definitely sketchy than the alternative. The pulled pork on top was very good, and there was a generous amount of it! The hickory barbecue sauce on it was also a nice touch. Overall, very satisfying, reasonably priced, and quick. I was probably in and out in less than 15 minutes. I didn't try any of the sides, but there are a bunch, like fries, loaded fries, popcorn, etc. Definitely a good spot for a quick lunch!

5	I am not exaggerating when I say this joint saved my life.  Picture this:  It's 1:30 am.  My friend is schwasted.  I am not.  I'm starving and my friend needs to sober up.  Enter Boardwalk on Carson.  I had spied it earlier in the evening and had made a mental note.  Drunk friend and sober me both loved our hot dogs, which is the most you can want out of a late-night eatery on Carson St.  To top it all off, the staff was incredibly nice--including the man who had spent the better part of the past three hours dancing outside in 20 degree weather wearing a hot dog suit.  Can't ask for better service than that.
