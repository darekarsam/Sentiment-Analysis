5	Tested out a couple of guitars here last year and was extremely comforted to be shown around by a seriously great guitarist (I think he was the owners son?)He spent half an hour trying to figure out which one would give me the tone I was looking for. They sell everything you would expect from a music store, but with the added advantage musical knowledge behind the counter. He didn't have to spend that time with me but I felt like he wanted to, thats why they're getting 5 stars.
5	I was there in the summer 2012, I've buy my 1st  guitar on my life! I'm not a musician , i give they my 5 stars for the way they say welcom to the customers, they are polite and kind, I like too much find people like this.My guitar is ok , but is in the corner to my wardrobe...I don't play it.....ihihihihihihih any way thake my stars !!!!!

4	While out wandering around Leith Walk trying to see where I could find a decent guitar to start learning with my new copy of Rocksmith we came across Rikki's with it's bold shop sign popped into view ahead.We were warmly welcomed when we entered and he was quite helpful in finding the right guitar to start with, giving me a quick demo to get a feel for it and hooking me up with gear for it.They are pretty crammed wall to wall with all sorts of instruments and with the really warm service i'd recommend a visit if you're ever that way inclined.
