5	Stefania is a great trainer! She is firm and direct with her approach but makes her workout sessions innovative so it's never boring. I've been working with her for 2 months and have lost 15 lbs from just working out, now she's helping me with my nutrition and I haven't felt better...thank you for all your help & support Stefania!
5	I've been doing light exercises like yoga and walking but wanted to start high intensity training. Stefania has helped me to form an exercise regimen and I've learned the proper way to train. Our sessions are great and I've been able to work hard despite my prior injuries. I recommend her for beginners and or those with prior injuries.
5	Stefania is an amazing trainer!!! She is excellent at tailoring intensity level based on what you can handle and pays special attention to form. She is super creative so you never get bored and she finds different ways to challenge the bodyIn addition to my regular sessions with her, she designs work out plan for the gym which is super helpful!!
5	Stefania is amazing! No joke. I am thin naturally but I had no real strength or endurance. I didn't work out because I got bored quickly when doing the same routine over and over again. I love coming to Stef because my workout is always different and fun. I also like that she wouldn't let me be lazy lol. She also pays close attention to detail, you will always feel comfortable working out with Stef because she is very conscious of how your posture is. No workout injuries here! She is also very knowledgeable when it comes to healthy eating and vitamins! I never took vitamins until I met Stef and it's helped a lot with my energy levels. She's helped me really change my lifestyle and I would definitely recommend her if you are looking to do the same! Thanks Stef!
