4	Very affordable in the off-season (like 75 bucks) and had a free breakfast/popcorn too boot.Also has a coffee bar in the lobby
4	Best hotel for the price in Tempe. Convenient to campus (short drive) and airport. Usually stay at The Mission Palms (which is extremely convenient to ASU), but has become extremely pricey. Country Inn is Clean, roomy, great beds, and super staff.
5	From Florida to Arizona, Country Inns & Suites is my home away from home place to stay with it's great customer service, nice size rooms, continental breakfast and wonderful amenities, I choose you!  My last visit was this past week with smiles to greet us as we came through the door Erin, was an absolute delight.  I'd like to thank Jared for braving the elements of one very crazy evening, Kevin was helpful and thoughtful above and beyond and thank you Melissa for greeting us graciously every morning as you served us your incredible goodies, even making extras for our loved ones.  You were all fabulous and I wanted to make sure you were acknowledged for your fine customer service and caring ways.  I'll be back!
