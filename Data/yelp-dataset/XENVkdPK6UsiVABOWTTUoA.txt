5	Hi Rich, well, I just want to say how good I feel, my shoulders have been bothering me for quite some time and now after seeing u for massage 2 weeks in a row, wow I feel great, my shoulders are finally relaxed, thank you thank you thank you, ur the best
5	Rich is the best, he listens to your needs and customizes your massage to make u feel great, can't wait for my next visit.... C u soon Rich
5	Massage from Rich is one of the healthiest things I do for myself. He listens to my complaints and dials in the exact treatment. An active person, I am typically straining this or overusing that; Rich has a knack for precisely accessing those overused areas and guiding them back to recovery. His irrepressible positive regard and friendly supportiveness boost my emotional state, which also helps my musculo-skeletal body.
5	Rich has incredible presence and an advanced level of skill.  Intuition, palpation sensitivity and quality of touch are superb. My body feels looser & much more relaxed afterwards, and without the "massage brain" hangover that often comes with deep & intense bodywork
