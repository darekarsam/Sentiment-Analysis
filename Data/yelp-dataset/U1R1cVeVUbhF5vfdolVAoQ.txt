5	I find this Hair Salon is very elite and professional. Anyone in Downtown are or Westmount is recommended to try it out. The atmosphere is so relaxing and the stuff is really kind. Love the owner Irene, beautiful and kind woman. Every time I get the hair cut here or the blow dry I never leave disappointed. Love it!
1	Was referred here by a friend. Asked for a hairstyle that was wash and wear (I do not own a blow dryer and do not wish to get one)  simple bob at shoulder length... left with an ear length chop job whose poor quality was hidden by a very proficient blow job that hid the unevenness of the cut and the layers I SPECIFICALLY ASKED NOT TO HAVE. Extremely disappointed - worst haircut I have ever had, it would have looked better if I had done it on my own with a blindfold. I now have the choice of getting an even shorter cut or look like hell until it grows out - not a happy choice. I hate short hair.
