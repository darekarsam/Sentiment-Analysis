4	Muy bien.  Between this place and Zapattas, I could eat mexican food all week.
3	Not a stand-out Mexican place, but still passable. I had the Burrito Tequila, which was jammed with thin flank steak and HUGE! Staff was friendly. Make sure you ask for Big Papi when you get there. He'll take good care of you.
5	Love their sopa de pollo.   Tortillas are great and the salsa is fresh.   Beer specials $1.99 for any pint,  including craft IPA,  make this place a great watering hole too.
5	My favorite restaurant. The veggie quesadillas, spinach enchiladas, and burrito tequila are at the top of my list. All three pair nicely with a Victoria or glass of red.The service here is excellent! We have always had a great experience whether lunch or dinner - the staff is the best!
4	I'm visiting from out of town.  I ordered the chimichangas to go.  I enjoyed it, and the guacamole and pico de gallo that came with it.  I will go again while I'm here for the week.
5	My ALL-time favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte!  Fantastic atmosphere in bAr area and amazing food!  Their homemade hot sauce is a MUST!
4	The food is really good here! I've tried many of their dishes and I've got to say that this one on of the few Mexican restaurants that I enjoy! From the nacho to burritos to fajitas they are all really good! And the alcohol beverages they sell are also really good! Would recommend this place to anyone!
5	Love this place! Love the margaritas and the service is outstanding! It is authentic gourmet mexican so it is average price, not too cheap but not too high either. LOVE LOVE LOVE the food!Pollo con Queso and Queso Fundido is amazing!
5	So good. Food, drinks, and service. I come here at least once every time I stay in the local hotel.
