5	Wings with porter buffalo are superb the house burger is totally worth the price the house salad is huge and the breakfast buffet is so fresh and clean. Ever if you are not a hotel guest go there for the food and happy hour alone a hidden gem in central Phx.
5	House burger was great, server was friendly and they take non-menu requests if available. Recommended to visit at least once while staying at Wyndham Garden Hotel.
