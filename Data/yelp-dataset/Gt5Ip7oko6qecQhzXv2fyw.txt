5	Went in "just to look" at clubs, and left with a really cool Nike set.  Steve was very patient with me and my husband and didn't try to upsell us in any way.  I took practice swings with clubs from different sets and received several helpful hints to help me make the correct decision.  Prices were fair.  What I really liked was that Las Vegas Golf & Tennis felt more comfortable than Golf Galaxy.  I look forward to returning soon to check out the clothing section.
5	Shannon the store manager is an expert on tennis footwear and apparel, and offered low key but helpful advice on fit and style.  Came all the way from Boston for sneakers, left with some great apparel too.  Thanks for the great tennis shopping experience!
5	I really enjoy this store. The sales team is very good and not pushy at all. They helped me find what I was looking for and even inform me of deals and what might be on clearance. Being the tennis rookie that I am, Shannon helped me find what I need without getting too overwhelmed or breaking the bank. She even gave me some helpful advice on how to improve my tennis game. (Thank you!!) It's a great store, good prices and friendly staff. I know my husband has enjoyed his experience on the golf side as well.
5	Great store with very helpful customer service. Big selection and comfortable atmosphere. I like this place. I'm not a huge golfer but I do like going when I can. In spite of this, I didn't get the feeling I was not welcome. I mean, some places will look down on you if you aren't pro status. Not here. Very welcoming. Twice I've had a salesman come through to really make sure I found what I was looking for. Just a great representation of the sport. Respect
