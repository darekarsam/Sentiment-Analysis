5	Hello! I'm a cross country runner & it being my first year I injured myself greatly - giving me a limp for the longest time. I even took a break off the season! But when I came to Ron after being recommended by my mom's coworker, just after 2 sessions, my limp was completely gone & my stride significantly improved. I did better at practice & at my races! Would HIGHLY recommend this place for runners or any athlete involved in any very active sports. Not only will Ron be able to fix any problem, pain, or restriction for your body, but he will also help you improve your actions with tips! The environment  is great & gives off good vibes! If you're looking to get better quickly, this is the place!
5	Just finished with my first evaluation appointment.  It went GREAT!  Ron is super friendly and knowledgeable.  The facility is very clean and well equipped.  Ron educated me on how my improper biomechanics are the root cause of my foot pain.  We talked about my history of foot ailments, evaluated my strength levels,  worked on some strength exercises, watched a video evaluation of my leg movements and I left with some exercises to do at home until my next appointment.  I can't wait to go back and continue on my road to recovery!!!  I highly recommend him to anyone who is focused on WELLNESS and staying active and pain free.
