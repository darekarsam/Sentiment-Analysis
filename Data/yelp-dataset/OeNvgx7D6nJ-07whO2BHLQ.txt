4	A quirky modern-Victoriana curiosity, with pretty handmade things displayed in unique surroundings, it's hard to tell if I liked looking at the artwork of the stylish and creatively arranged cabinets, or whether the pieces themselves were part of my wishlist...Like a Tom Waits song sprung to life, with a little Victoriana mixed in....it's beautiful and quirky and intelligent and, unfortunately, on the expensive side.  But it *is* wearable and useable art, which very much appeals.There are handmade jewelry pieces, functional art for the home and kitchen, and small sculptures for your desk or home deco.The woman who runs Black Box is very helpful and will give you information about any of the pieces or artists.  Having only just opened when I was in, she was also in the process of updating the website, so it might be worthwhile checking in on it once in a while if you can't make it into one of the most wonderful wee shops I've been into in Edinburgh.
4	While I am too old for Claire's (unless I'm taking my niece in), I still feel as though I'm not quite ready to be in ultra posh jewelry stores where there are guards standing outside and diamonds dripping everywhere.  That's why I really love Black Box.  Sure there are some pieces that are out of my price range, but there are also items that would fall in my price range, the upper end of my price range.  However, the items are stunning and quite different from the cookie-cutter stuff you see on the high street.I happened to really love the display of some dainty looking rings and necklaces, hearts and stars... even though I didn't buy one today... there is still tomorrow!
