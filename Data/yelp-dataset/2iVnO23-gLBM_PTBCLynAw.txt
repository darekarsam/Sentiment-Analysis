3	I agree with Stuart on certain points - Dersim Kebab House is open late and it's cheap, so in that sense its got its perks. But I'm put off by how glaringly greasy the food is.I've not seen it open early in the day (to be fair, the thought of getting a kebab before midday is revolting), but illuminated by its strip lighting it looks a bit seedy at night.Before you get in the door, you are greeted with massive laminated pictures of all the meal deals they do. They don't really try to tart up the appetisers by giving them names, they refer to them in numbers. Not exactly tempting when it's seemingly served up like prison food.I'm being a bit harsh - the content wasn't actually that bad. Morbid curiosity led me to eat in here and I wasn't actually disappointed. Portions are very generous and the staff are friendly enough.Don't get me wrong - I've had worse kebabs. But even though I'm basing this critique on the appearance of Dersim Kebab House, it's just as important as what's inside. With the shabby frontage and less than appealing signs in the window, they sell themselves short. The food is decent enough and if it's two in the morning, you could do worse than to hook yourself up with a kebab in here.
5	Was walking home really late after a nice girls' night and decided that I should indulge my sinful midnight hunger pangs so my friends and I hopped into Dersim Kebab House. Oh, the aroma!!We weren't the only ones there at that hour (around 3am), 5 other people were in line for supperDespite having made the wrong order and having to get them to change it (they were already making it, opps... guilty!), they were very nice about it and told us not to worry.Finally, they gave us our large chicken kebabs for only 6.50! It had generous toppings and the meat tasted so fresh. I wish I found out about this place earlier!!
