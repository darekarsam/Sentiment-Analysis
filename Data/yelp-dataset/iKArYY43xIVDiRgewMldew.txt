5	The food at this new cafe was very good and the service was great. Decor is western and very clean. Will go back soon.
4	REALLY enjoyed it! First visit, motorcycle parking outside, GREAT service, friendly waitress, LOVED the spicy potatoes, very reasonably priced. Recommend it!
4	The patty melt with a green chile add on was great.  It's definitely worth the walk from the downtown area to this little spot.
5	Great food in a cozy environment. We've had breakfast and lunch there many times and love it. Great service. Highly recommended
4	This is a nice little down home cafe a little past the business district. There is plenty of off street parking, even for large horse trailers or RV's. The food is good, the prices very reasonable, and the service very friendly and attentive. Easily recommended for a good meal.
