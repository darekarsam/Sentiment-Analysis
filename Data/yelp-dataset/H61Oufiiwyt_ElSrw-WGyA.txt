4	Church's keeps sending me coupons that seem to be amazing in value, such as the one I headed out with on this visit for a 2-piece meal including a leg, thigh, mashed potatoes & gravy, & a biscuit for $1.99!  (Reg. $4.99 inc. a drink.)  I finally got curious enough to whip over there this morning & try it.The chicken here is crispy, & you choose between original recipe & spicy.  I went with the spicy, & it was spicy but not "hot hot".  My order came up almost immediately as I paid, & the chicken pieces were surprisingly large!  They were also cooked just right, & tasty.  The mashed potatoes & biscuit were good, too.  I had every expectation of giving this place 2 Stars, maybe 3, but as good as it was, plus fast, friendly service & an amazing price with the pretty much always available coupons, I'm an instant fan!     :-))
1	they gave me cold mac and cheese.
4	I always get coupons from them and it always bring me back to buy their chicken and the price are also good too. But they don't have a drive-thru like the one on baseline and I'm just being lazy..
