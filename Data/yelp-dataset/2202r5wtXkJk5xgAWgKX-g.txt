1	I used 24-7 Locksmith and mentioned the internet ad hoping to receive my discount. Not only did I not receive the discount, but I have been lied to all 7 times I have called trying to resolve this issue. This business uses the bate and switch. I feel cheated.
1	I was told on the phone it would be a starting price of $119 depending how long it takes.When the tech showed up he quoted $260. I talked him down and he agreed to do it for $220 but in cash. It took him less than a min program the fob. so in my eyes it should have been $119!I wish I would have read the review.  YES I FEEL CHEATED
1	Lousy. Do not use this service.Got tricked with the $15 ad and paid $75 for the same service I was quoted $45 for.Disgusting.
1	Bait and switch. They quote $15 and then charge you over $100 after they have already done the work. Do not use.
1	DO NOT Do business with this company.  They are scammers and are not professional.  People need to be forewarned about this company.  In their website you will noticed that they don't have information as to their companies address etc.  This company is probably not a legitimate business.  I checked on the state of Nevada website and this company is not listed.  Shouldn't they have a bond or license number on their webpage?  Their BBB rating is F.  So please do not make the mistake that I made.  I will give this company a negative 10 star rating.
