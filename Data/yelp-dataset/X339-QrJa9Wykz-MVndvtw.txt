3	I can Never find what I'm looking for but always know they'll take anything I drop off! Donations beat any dump fees.
2	This particular Goodwill store is always a mess.  Rarely can I find what I'm looking for, with decent quality, but I have found a few things worth while.  If I have the chance to go to a Goodwill farther away I will, even though this is the closest to me.
2	This has to be the most unorganized, cluttered, dump-your-crap here, Goodwill in the East Valley!  It's their 50% off day and they have 1 register open!  I was there from 2-4 looking around, and only once did they have 2 registers open but after ringing up a few customers the cashier announced it was her lunch break and left, with no replacement!  It's hot, cramped, and cluttered.  There is no rhyme or reason to their racks and most of their stuff is broken or dirty.  Don't waste your time or money, find another Goodwill to shop at.
4	I have been to this store about thirty times. I have gone through the childrens book section and straightened it out a few times. Probably 30 minutes?The store doesn't create the mess. Customers create the mess. This store is neater than some Ross and Marshall stores. The book section is big and I straighten any area I am in. The chain serves a lot of people in Az and perhaps instead of criticising it we might spend one minute in straightening.If parents kept their children with them and were better examples the place might be neater. All stores have some poor pricing but also offer a huge  money savings on perfectly good clothing. Normally I find towels, sheets and blankets in terrible condition. I did get a beautiful blanket  years ago.
