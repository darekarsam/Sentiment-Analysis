3	Not a bad little nail place! This is no spa, but if you need a quick manicure for $15 CAN, this isn't the worst you could do!
4	I don't like to spend a lot of time getting my nails done.I've been going there for the last four years and the service is excellent.They will take you as soon as possible if you don't have an appointment. Linda the owner is extremely hygiene conscious and I have seen her keep up-to-date with the latest technology to keep everything safe and clean. They are also open seven days a week.They do  better work than some very costly spas  ive been to, as far as I'm concerned.
4	Went there for a quick mani on Christmas' Eve. Was not disappointed. I brought a picture of what I had in mind and the lady made it easily ! 15$ manicure was fast and done with careful attention. They charged me an extra 15$ for the design (took her about 25 min to do). Fast and meticulous ! I loved my experience and will clearly go again. Bad side: noisy place and not very confortable. Not much of a spa kind of place...
