5	Helpful, informative staff in all departments, do a great job at very fair prices. Outstanding service and genuinely care about the customer. Thoroughly recommend.
5	Helpful staff, sales, parts and service. Excellent customer service, great pricing on service, parts and sales. The sales transaction is transparent, no hidden fees and financing options that make sense. I really love the family owned feel of the place!
5	Very friendly sales staff. Took the time to answer all our questions. We had a blast on our new side by side.
5	This is one of the few shops in the valley that are truly  customer focused. The team  they have assembled at  North Valley Honda are simply the best. What I like best about the shop is that their staff are very knowledgeable. They don't make up stuff to just sell you something and get rid of you. If the person you're working with doesn't have the answer they will  find somebody in the shop that does. Levi is one of my favorite people to work with. He is knowledgeable on   everything in the shop and makes recommendations  based on your budget and what you need without any pressure. Stop in , you will not be disappointed.
5	Favorite bike shop in town! Always fun to ride down & get what I need done. Great customer service & definitely in my recommendations
5	Great experience selling my Gold Wing on Consignment.  Didn't want to sell moved out of state and the comfort of Don and the crew was great.   Received a check for a fair amount and they took care of everything.  Thanks for the great experience.
5	I have been dealing with North Valley Honda for over five years. Incredibly happy with service  and price. I have purchased three bikes from them and will never go anywhere else. They make you feel comfortable no matter what you're riding experience is. Big props to Rick my sales guy and Kyle my service guy.  They both go above and beyond.      Thxs Artie M.
