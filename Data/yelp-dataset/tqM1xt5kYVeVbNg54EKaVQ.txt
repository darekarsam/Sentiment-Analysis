5	This is Miss Donna's main studio.  I brought my daughter in for private lessons in technique.  Her instructor, Ms. Ashley, was very nice and it was a great investment on my part. After all, we were there for instruction and that is what we received.  There are a number of rooms available vs. the standard one-room available at the Long Creek location.  The studio has open WI-FI and a number of seats for waiting parents.  My guess is that the facility and the parking lot are a madhouse during dance season!  We will see if I have to indulge in that aspect this year...phew...maybe so.
1	This place is a rip off! My girls took classes through their preschool where the teacher comes to the school. After 6 months, the girls were doing the same thing week after week and learning nothing new. I could have taught them that at home. Optional recitals were so expensive, especially the costumes. You are better off popping in a DVD at home & saving $$!Some days the teacher would no show, yet you pay for the class. Then you would have to call & fight for a refund.
5	My experience with Miss Donna's carries over three years. Yes, competition dancers pay more, a lot, but that is the nature of the beast. I have not found any instructor to be irresponsible when it comes to teaching their students. Miss Donna has been in business since around1955. She knows dance. A large majority of the teachers are former students yet she is involved in day to day instruction and knows what's doing on in every class. The prices here are comparable and the outfits are of higher quality than many others.
