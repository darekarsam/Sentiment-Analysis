3	This location is the closest store to me now that the one in the Chandler mall closed. It is ok, I guess. The one in the Tempe Marketplace seems to get more merchandise and is better staffed (I guess because its bigger).
5	A great shop for the big girls in your life.
5	Went into your store on 4619 E Ray Rd, October 19th - and was immediately greeted by your two employees. I was there to find an outfit for a job interview that I had and I started asking Abigail for her opinions.  This girl went BEYOND the call of duty and helped me out so much. I am a very self conscience lady and this sweet girl put me at ease in my body. She repeatedly ran out to the floor, while I was in the fitting room, getting numerous clothes for me, trying out different styles and helping me choose an outfit that I was comfortable in that looked professional. Abigail was not only nice, but extremely professional and knew her styles!  Highly recommend this location! Thanks Abigail!
