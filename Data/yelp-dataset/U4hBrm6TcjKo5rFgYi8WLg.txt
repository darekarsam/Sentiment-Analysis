4	It's Jack in the Box just like any other franchise. The food tastes good just like it should I've heard that some Jack's have changed some of the ways things should be made. I've never had a problem with them or my order. They get you in an out just like it should be not very long wait time.
3	Tastes like JITB.  The tables were really dirty.  Wasn't busy at all and nobody cleaning the tables.  I'm glad I brought my own wipes.
2	So here's the deal on JITB.  In the 5 years we have lived in Buckeye we have only gone through the drive thru at this location.  We have only gotten the oreo shakes.  (Little tip if you bring them home and put them in the freezer for a couple of hours they are simply awesome you eat them with a spoon)  So yesterday my wife and I decided to stop in here and get some of the food.  The service was very friendly as it always has been. The dinning room was cleanish, but for whatever reason the men's bathroom was closed.  The food honestly was not good.  A couple of cheeseburgers, an order of curly fries, a couple of tacos that I have heard people rave about, and a drink.  The meat on the burgers is obviously a frozen patty that was overcooked and dry.  The fries were ok, but the tacos were not that good, and I cannot figure out why people would rave about them.  Really aside from the occasional oreo shake I will not be returning to this place for anything else.
