1	I had set up a private lesson  for my daughter.  I let the coordinator know my intention was to do this 1-2 times per month. It's a 27 mile ride each way. The coach text me 2 days before to confirm the date and time. I drive there with my daughter and arrive for the lesson. At the exact time the lesson started, my cell phone rings that the coach had car trouble. I said okay, well give me a call when it's fixed to reschedule. I guess stuff happens. As I drove in traffic each way, it was 80 minutes of wasted time. 3 weeks went by with no calls, texts or emails. I was using this as an opportunity to evaluate for club next season. I will not be pursuing them.
