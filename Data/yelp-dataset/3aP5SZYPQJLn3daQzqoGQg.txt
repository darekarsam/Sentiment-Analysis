5	I needed to stop by a vape shop for my little brother to get some refills. I was eating at Vito Pizza and when I left I saw there was a vape shoppe across the street near the Little Caesar. I was like what a coincidence. Went there and was treated with a friendly staff and very knowledgeable employees on what I needed. I got what my brother needed and took an extra refill of some Skittle flavored ones also. I would say place was clean and very welcome expierence. My brother tested the Skittles flavor and really loved it. I give them a 5 star for good experience and knowledge.
5	This is by far one of the best vape shops I have been in. David is the shit and always can answer a question and even if he doesn't know he says let me find out for you. Loon is great really knows how to get it done. Friendly people overall when I walked in the atmosphere was just really relaxed but very professional they make anyone and everyone that walks into the shop part of the Trinity family. Whenever I need something they are always quick and accurate with everything whether it be a coil build or a new juice. For someone that can never pick a juice and only knows what they are feeling I just let them know and they make a perfect juice everytime even when I didn't think I could make up my mind. All in all its a great family to be a part of!
5	Trinity is the best vape shop i have ever set foot inside. Mike is an awesome guy and always willing to make a good deal. He is honest and works very hard to bring us a shop with a really great atmosphere and a large selection of the newest and best mods and attys. He has gone out of his way to find things i am looking for when he doesn't already have it. He makes awesome juices in any flavor you can dream up, Plus he is just fun to be around. My husband and I will continue to go to Trinity. This is now our home shop.
