5	Hired Events by Juls to host a surprise birthday party. There were 30 people coming from 5 different states, timing and transportation had to be handled like a military operation so it would stay a surprise. Julie and her team did a great job not only planning that first day but all the eventsRabbi Felipe GoodmanRabbi Felipe Goodman of Temple Beth Sholom in Las Vegas has been described as "the biggest badass in the whole world". Though Felipe is the author of the book "Torah From Sin City", his true strengths lie not in words, but in actions: He has traveled to New York to protest against Ahmadinejad's address at the UN, has been involved in strengthening the relationship between the Jewish community and the Obama administration, and has received an award from Shimon Peres honoring his support for Israel.Rabbi Goodman's BlogAmerica's Most Inspiring Rabbis that weekend. Can't say enough about the skill and professionalism the whole team exhibited. All my guests were raving about the job she did.
5	Juls is the best!  We hosted 3 days of events for 30+ guests from overseas.  Juls was on top ever aspect and was able to handle any last min emergencies as well.  Including last min. transportation to and from the Strip on New Years Eve.  We highly recommend Events By Juls.  She is creative, responsive and a great pleasure to work with.
