4	Wow...this spire is BEAUTIFUL! And the fact that it's a Frank Lloyd Wright piece, also known as the Taliesin West Promenade Spire, doesn't hurt. It's a true piece of art in that it looks good no matter what time of day it is; daylight, dusk, evening. The spire shows beautifully at any time of day.
4	I've passed by this spire, on foot and in cars, for years, but I only found the water fountain a few months ago while on a stroll. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frank-lloyd-wright-spire-scottsdale?select=sKiua623YZpCKgcfsnCHmA#sKiua623YZpCKgcfsnCHmA  Why I never spotted it before, I don't know, but I'm glad I found it.  Now, when I'm in the area, I try to make it a point to visit, for it is so pretty and tranquil here, even amidst parking lots and heavy traffic on Scottsdale Rd.
5	One of the rare things I miss about my time in Arizona is my daily drives past this piece of public art.  Large in scope and brilliantly lit at night this is a piece that can be enjoyed any time of day and with a small park/fountain set at its foot I often came here to simply read or relax - the nearby mall offering ample parking at no fee.  Built from plans after the great architect's death this should be a stop for any fan of the man or his work, a brief stop en route to Taliesin West perhaps.
5	This is one of the fun signature pieces in Scottsdale. Similar to the giant Solari Bells at The Waterfront. Anything that adds a little color to the brown desert landscape is A OKay in my book. This piece is fun because of how it is lit up at night too.
4	Beautiful high-rise building, with good location, but has few shopping options, the Frank Lloyd Wright Spire is the largest. But for this looking for clothes for the American winter, has The North Face that is traditional and famous in the US. Has food court.
4	The modern shopping and great location, I had lunch a few days days in this mall and always liked your options. Has several well known stores worldwide.
