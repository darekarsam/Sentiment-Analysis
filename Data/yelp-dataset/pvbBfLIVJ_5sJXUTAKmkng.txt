4	Nice clean restaurant, I have had the club sandwich twice and the portion is really filling and really very good and the service was very pleasant as well.This visit a 5PMer onn Friday, I was brought a bowl of fresh popcorn before ordering thought that was a pretty funny but nice touch.They also have a special with a pint of beer you get a platter of free nachos.
4	The food is good and the portions are really big, so bring your appetite. There is also a pop-corn machine in the restaurant. You can eat popcorn as much as you like.
