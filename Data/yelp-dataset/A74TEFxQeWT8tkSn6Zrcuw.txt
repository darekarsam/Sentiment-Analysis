5	Huge, warren-like venue centrally located, with arguably the best, and certainly the biggest, beer garden around. There's a good assortment of shows that generally tend to be of good caliber, and the atmosphere is just great, lively and buzzing. A good place to hang out with festival actors if you're into that sort of thing.
