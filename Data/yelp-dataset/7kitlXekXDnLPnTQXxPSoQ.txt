3	Met someone here to play on the tennis courts.  Surprisingly the courts were in good shape, the nets were missing the straps, but we played through it.  Overall it's a nice complex.... my one complaint would be that the parking lot is a bit of a maze to get out with a lot of curves (which means a lot of blind spots if you are backing out).  Yes, it keeps the place looking interesting, but I would hate to be a grounds keeper here since there are no straight lines in sight.The apartments look pretty solid, all-brink.... there is a lot of highway noise coming from 485 though.... I didn't go inside one unit, but it was fairly loud from the tennis court.
5	My boyfriend and I decided to look for an apartment and Pavilion Crossings was the one we ended up picking. We moved here a couple months ago and we still enjoy it. The location is great because it's close to the UNCC campus and much better priced than those ridiculous student housing complexes filled with frat and sorority parties.  The staff is great and friendly and maintenance service is quick. The tennis courts and pool are also great. The only thing I don't like is the gym. It is sort of small and the treadmills are always broken down. Parking can be hectic sometimes when you arrive late at night, but you can find a space in nearby buildings. We got free high speed internet and free cable so that is always a plus. The speed is great and we didn't have to upgrade to a faster package which saved us some money. Overall this apartment complex is great and it offers residents with many resources. It is great for a first apartment or even moving in with a family.
4	This is where i call home... The honeycomb hideout!!! My temple, my crib.. Very peachy spot lol.. Until the kids decide they wanna play tennis and football at 11pm, therefore the tennis court lights shine into my bedroom lol.. But its cool, im all about physical activity...
