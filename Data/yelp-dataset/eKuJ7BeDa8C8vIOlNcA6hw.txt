5	I am an avid shopper at both antique/refurbished shops and gift/boutique shops so when I found Cotswold Marketplace, I hit the jackpot!  With many local artists represented, the marketplace a place where over 40 different vendors come together to make for a fantastic leisurely shopping day.   If you live in either the SouthPark area or East Charlotte, it is super convenient for that last minute gift for anyone-whether it be the reclaimed wood picture frame or the AMAZING  Ella.B Pure candles all named after different areas of Charlotte. and don't forget a precious handmade felt card by Bobbin!If you looking  to change up your dining room, Cotswold Marketplace is the spot for you as well. If the fabulous  mix of mid-century modern, Asian, art deco, and more overwhelm you, they have experienced interior decorators who have vendor spaces as well.   The refurbished and repurposed antiques are not what most of us would find in grandma's attic;These fabulous finds are a quite a bit more classy than your Saturday yard sale finds.  If I am looking for a place to splurge, this is where I go for that one statement piece that is going to transform a room.  On the flip side, this place is as southern as you get. I mean where else can you get a pair of running shorts with your initials monogrammed on them?  Or maybe you want Fido to have a chevon printed collar.  As you can see, the vendors greatly vary which makes for a surprise around every turn! Happy hunting!
