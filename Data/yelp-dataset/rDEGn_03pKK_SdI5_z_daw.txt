5	Loved the care given to me by Rose, one of their M.A.'s. When everyone else seemed to be too busy to talk to me about a personal issue, Rose took the time to not only listen but she helped me explain it to the doctor because I was too embarrassed. I am going back to this office, thank you Rose.
5	Not really something that I usually review but for anyone thats looking for a good OB/GYN comr here for Samantha!   I absolutely love her.  She is the PA who works with Dr. Melissa Austin.  She does an amazing job with each appointment and is very thorough with her work.  She is passionate and patient and will listen to all your concerns.  She is the first OB/GYN that has made me feel so comfortable being naked and examined in doctors office.  Usually pap smears or other exams make me feel so vulnerable and not really sure what to expect but Samantha communicates with you each and every step so you know exactly what to expect and feel. Absolutely love her!
1	That's it I've had it with this office! I can't do it anymore! These people don't work. The girls that do the scheduling need to go back to school. I've been here 5 times now, every time I am an hour waiting past my appointment! They just put me in the wrong room. And now I'm not even going to get to see the doctor. They don't respect me or my time. I'm done! I'm telling her what my problem is, and she's writing filling out her paperwork. How can she write and listen to me at the same time! Very dismissive. Doesn't even look at me when she's talking. This place sucks I'm never coming back!
