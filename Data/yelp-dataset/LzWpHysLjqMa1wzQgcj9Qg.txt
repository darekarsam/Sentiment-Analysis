5	I may have just been the luckiest woman in the world to have the best wedding vendors- ever.  Arizona Inspirations Catering was no exception.This for me was my first and only stop for food.  My husband and I are foodies and so this was a very important part of our wedding.  We had 2 tastings, and they were awesome, but were invited to as many as we wanted to attend.  The food we tried was great and the food at the wedding was better.Nik and his chef made my day.I'm searching for another reason to have them cater.

5	Looking for a good caterer for our wedding was harder than I expected until we ran into this amazing caterer with a wide range of food options.  The owner, Nik, hosted us for a great dinner to try out his southwestern cuisine and it was seriously amazing! We ended up booking him right away (and at a fraction of the cost of the more expensive ones we were considering).  People loved the food!  It was spicy and full of flavor but not too spicy for the old gringos.  The ingredients were fresh and packed with flavor.  My only complaint was that the pork dried out a tiny bit, but every other bite was fantastic.  People also loved the southwestern corn side dish.  We would DEFINITELY recommend these guys and would use them again if the need arose.
