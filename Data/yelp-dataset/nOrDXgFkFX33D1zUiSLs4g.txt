5	If you're already familiar with Family Video from elsewhere, nothing will shock you at this store except for how friendly some of the employees are.  We are enjoying the half off period when we first joined.  It's pretty great to walk away with two new releases and two nearly newish for $4.  I love Netflix and use Redbox as well, but I appreciate how the 5 day rental period is more forgiving than 5 days at the Redbox.
5	Although people joke that physical movie rental stores are extinct and unnecessary, it's actually really awesome to have one nearby for those days/nights when I'm looking for something good to watch but need a bigger selection than Redbox offers and better options than Netflix or Amazon streaming provide.The staff here are very friendly and helpful and the number of movies, TV shows, and video games available for rental is almost overwhelming. Oh, and if you need a snack to eat while watching your rental, they have some good options for that, too.Prices to rent movies range from free (for kids' movies) to a few bucks for a 5-night rental, but I think they are very fair given the service being provided. Many movies are available for $1, and some are even 2 for $1 (although the latter are mostly what you'd find available to stream through an Amazon Prime account).The Wife and I just started using Family Video this past week, but we've already been back a few times and will definitely return soon.
