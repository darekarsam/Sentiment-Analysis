5	I purchased a home several months ago and have had some problems with the irrigation system. I called Las Vegas Irrigation Repair and Carlos came out to review the situation and make an estimate for repair. He was very professional and took his time to make sure everything was checked out. He went through the property explaining where there were problems. After thinking it over, I decided to have the work done. I thought the price was reasonable and four staff came to do the work. They had to dig up some of the lines so that they could be easily seen--I can now keep an eye on everything and know when there is an issue. I was pleased with their work and feel better knowing that my irrigation system is working properly. I would recommend them highly.
5	Excellent service. Quick response. Replaced irrigation valves and tested. Very professional.
5	I had a problem with my sprinkler system flooding next door. It was a leak and the team of 3 guys came out and fixed it in short time! Tested the system and cleaned up the mess. Highly professional!
1	Had a horrible experience with this company. Bought a new sprinkler system which was installed incorrectly (left the test valve open so the system never turned off, and they didn't properly connect the valve wiring to controller), and the next day they missed the appointment window to fix the system. I didn't even receive a phone call that they would be late. Skip these guys. Not worth the time, money, or headache.
