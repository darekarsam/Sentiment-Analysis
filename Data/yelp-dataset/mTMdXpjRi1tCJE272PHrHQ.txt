4	Oh, the food was GOOD here. We really enjoyed the overall ambiance/decor and the taste. My dining partner and I have relatively milder palates, so we tried the tamer items--based on those, I think those diners who have stronger palates would be well-served by this place. Our food was great, but we definitely got a bit of a look for our relative timidity.On that note, I have to say, I found the service to be both overbearing and slow. I'm from NYC, so I'm no stranger to rude waitstaff, but our server here tried to get us to change our order in a way that felt rather disrespectful of our dining needs--trying to politely explain our food allergies got us nowhere, so we simply stuck to our guns and refused to change our order to suit the server's taste. I was further surprised by the length of the wait for our meal--especially because it wasn't the slightest bit busy when we went in. That said, it still gets four stars, because the food really was that awesome--and it was well-priced, too. My partner felt the portions could have been larger, but I thought they were the perfect size, and the taste was just marvelous.If there's better Indian in Montreal I haven't had it yet.
