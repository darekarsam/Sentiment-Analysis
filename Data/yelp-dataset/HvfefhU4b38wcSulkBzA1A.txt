5	Love this place! Looking for a place to call home? Look no further! I have been to many churches and have never felt the love and presence of God as I do here. The worship is so beautiful and powerful. God is truly in this place. The pastor and his staff are amazing . He always has a powerful message. It's a place of love, healing and the miraculous. You always fell welcomed when you step in and feel changed and renewed when you step out.
