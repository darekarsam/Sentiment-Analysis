4	This used to be my local library, right round the corner from where I lived. McDonald Road Library, at the end of the day, is a pretty standard Edinburgh local Library, but this not a bad thing. Not as well known as Leith Library down the road (albeit a very long road), McDonald Road keeps up the standards.It's a fairly large local library and other than lending books it offers the usual services like wi-fi, computer use as well as various classes and events (such as free computer lessons).As for books, it has a large children's selection (and it really seems to accommodate for the local school) as well as having a better than average number of graphic novels. It doesn't have a such a great selection of fiction, but ultimately there is limited space at a library like this. It also has a number of ethnic selections of books, I think in particular Chinese and Urdu (the library also offers Urdu lessons I believe).A great little local library that is particularly suitable for families and children.

However, I have noticed a few things about the McDonald Road Library, that perhaps set it apart.Firstly, it is a 49 hour library which means, you guessed it, that it's open 49 hours a week, including on a Sunday which is pretty handy if you tend to get a burning desire for fresh books over the weekend.  Also, it has wi-fi access, unlike a lot of the libraries in Edinburgh.  Also, I get the impression that it's one of the most multi-cultural libraries in the city, with sections of books in Urdu, Chinese, Polish, and a range of other European languages.  Finally, perhaps because of its central location, it's also invariably full of tired-looking old men smelling strongly of alcohol and who knows what else - which, in my opinion, gives the place a bit of local flavour!
