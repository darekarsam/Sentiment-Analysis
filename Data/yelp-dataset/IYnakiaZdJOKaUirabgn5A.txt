4	This is a great little place in the airport!I ended up at the airport really early for my flight, and wanted to get something to eat that wasn't the standard pastry or fast food chain. I didn't think I would be successful, but then I walked by this place. They do neat tapas type dishes and tapas sandwiches. I had a ham, goat cheese, and egg sandwich that was really tasty. It came on a nice, toasted French roll and the ham was good quality, not the deli or processed stuff that a lot of people use. It was very nice to find this little gem, and at the airport no less!
4	Really nice to have some good fresh food options at an airport.
3	I wanted to like this place. I think you can if you're interested in wine and maybe one dish. However we were a hungry group, and ordered a few items. What you'll come to quickly realize is they only have a few items that are repeated multiple times on the different dishes. For example - olives and macrona almonds. These two will end up repeatedly on every dish. They were also out of a few items which were frustrating. Diners beware - if you're getting one dish you may enjoy (although there is little substance). If you want wine you'll also get a selection. Otherwise be prepared to get a sandwich next door (or keep walking to the next dining and drinking area in the grill by gate 11).
