1	The one star is just because I felt I was being "sold to" more than caring for a patient.I felt she was more interested in selling me on products and other treatments than my overall health.  I had a question about how often I should use the cream she gave me to try and when I called to ask about it the person who answered the phone was really put off by me calling.
1	I could not tell you much about Dr Fisher, I need a hormone dr and as I did my research I really wanted to visit her. Called on a Monday to make an appointment, they did not answer, I left a message to call me so I could make this appointment! Here we are Wednesday not a call back, I called again I did get the receptionist BAD NEWS RIGHT AWAY!!!! Very cold, tells me she does not see patience on Mondays, I ask what days would work, it's Thanksgiving week, so NO Thursday's,I asked what day can I come down, I said maybe Tuesday, she said very hesitant ooh no not for something like that !!!! WHAT! LIKE WHAT, I NEED AN INITIAL COUNSELTATION , AND THEN A FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT TO SEE THE DR..... YOU DONT DO THAT!!!!! WHAT THE F! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND I DIDNT EVEN GET IN THE DOOR YET! HOPE THIS POOR DR KNOWS HER FRONT OFFICE IS GOING TO RUIN HER!!!!!
1	What a joke this office is. I called to make an appointment and the person I spoke with gave me every reason to not see this doctor and not one reason I should see her. After few minutes of meaningless conversation and excuses from the woman I was speaking with, I decided to pass.  I wrote the doctor an email to let her know that her office staff is driving patients away from he not to her.  I did this as a professional courtesy as I'm married to a physician and thought she should know. No response from the doctor, so she doesn't care either. My advice to anyone interested in her services is DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, find someone has the brains to hire a decent office staff because if she doesn't care to do that, she won't care about you.
