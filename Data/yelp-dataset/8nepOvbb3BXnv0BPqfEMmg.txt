5	The flight close one hour prior to the departure
1	Will never fly Copa again.  Mechanical error with our departure plane, which caused us to miss 1st day of our vacation.  During delays, the staff was very rude and not forthcoming with any information about the delays.  We were stuck in an airport for 7+ hours, and all they did was give us a $10 food/drink coupon?!  Once on our flight and in the air, the staff didn't speak English and I was actually told by a stuart that there was no bottled water...and  hours later I see him carrying a whole case of Dasani water.  And there's no in flight wifi.  Will not fly Copa again.
