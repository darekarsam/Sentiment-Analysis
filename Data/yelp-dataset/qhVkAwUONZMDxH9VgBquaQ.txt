1	Allante is located in a pretty convenient location. However, the customer service here is horrible. The young ladies who work at Allante are unhappy, stern and irresponsible. Seriously, one of them has a permanent frown and is barely willing to say a three words.Personality aside they're very good at under-delivering. They will say something will be ready by a certain time and it won't be. And, more importantly, if something they're responsible for happens don't expect on getting your experience righted without a fight.Caution. Caution. Strongly not recommended.
5	I have been using Allante cleaners for years and have been very satisfied. Great staff and great consistent services. Highly recommended as a discount cleaners ($2.25) for all garments. Completely disagree with other reviewer
5	It's true they used to have a frown-faced young employee, but she is gone. Sylvia the owner operator though is wonderful, and she and the remaining staff are always pleasant and helpful. Inexpensive and fast.
