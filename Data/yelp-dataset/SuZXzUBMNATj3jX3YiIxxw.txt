4	A group of friends and I went to The Break Room on Tuesday and we had SO MUCH FUN! The drinks were reasonably priced and had just the right kick we needed to get up in front of everyone and do karaoke! Jennifer the karaoke host was GREAT! She had a wide selection of songs and if she didn't already have the song we wanted she would find it right away. The pool tables were fun too but singing Spice Girls made my night!  And don't let the star rating fool you. I'm only giving The Break Room four stars because it's not the greatest place to look at, but don't judge a book by it's cover people!#TwoThumbsUp
4	i decently priced bar with surprisingly good food for a great price. free pool during the weekdays and a galaga cab alongside a good pinball machine (if they get it fixed lol)the sandwiches are killer, good stuff here. definitely not for people who are used to quiet bars though
4	Sports bar. Good crowd for a Saturday afternoon so that says something about the place. They have one large TV screen plus a bunch of smaller ones, 4 pool tables and 3 dart boards. Nothing fancy but the food was very good. I got the pastrami sandwich with onion rings. I bought a Restaurant.com gift certificate to try out the place. I thought $3 for a soda was a little much.
