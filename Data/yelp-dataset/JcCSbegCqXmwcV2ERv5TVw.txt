4	Despite it being a chain, I'm such a fan of Subway -- and even moreso now that I live on the 'true to tv advertised prices' mainland. While I was living in Hawaii, I would often get frustrated at the $5 footlongs advertised with the "not available in Hawaii" exclusion on the bottom of the screen. But there's no such problem here! This location is convenient to me and has friendly workers, with the usual great selection of fresh sandwich fixins. After 5pm most footlong subs are $5 if you buy two, which makes a great, reasonably priced dinner for two after a long day. I typically get the chicken bacon ranch, sans ranch plus southwest sauce -- it's SO good! Plus, there are often coupons in those weekly circulars that arrive in the mailbox - so it's possible to get yourself an even better deal if you take a few extra minutes. Eat fresh!
1	Upon walking into this particular Subway it didn't look very clean. Food on floors and tables not wiped down. I stood in line for 5 minutes and watched the workers gawking at me in an uncomfortable way, while whispering to each other. I walked right out and went next door to Senior Taco. Never going to that disgusting Subway again.
1	Dirty location.  The prep area was dirty and the seating was awkward.  The tables in the middle of the room make you feel like you are on an island.  The people line up literally around you while you are eating.  This would not be my choice of subways  to stop at.  Buy a premade sub from Safeway across the street and save the frustration.  Gross
2	I've been here twice. The first time there was not much of a line and I thought the sandwich was pretty good, but really not up to all the hoopla ...just a sandwich. The second time I stopped with some friends at 11:15am and there was not much of a line, but we were told (in a pretty snooty way) to come back at 2:30pm for our sandwiches because a big order had come in by fax.
