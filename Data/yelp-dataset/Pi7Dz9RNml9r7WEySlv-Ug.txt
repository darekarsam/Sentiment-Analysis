5	I love having Barri Chase as my hairdresser.   When I first starting going to her my hair had seriouse issues.   Now my hair looks fabulous!!!  She really knows what is good for your hair and what looks good on your head.  The salon is very cool and the atmosphere is great.   I love that she carries chemical free and environment friendly products.   Thsi place is the best!!!!
