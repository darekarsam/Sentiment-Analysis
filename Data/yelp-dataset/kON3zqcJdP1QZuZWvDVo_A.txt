5	I only go here when I am craving a chicken stuffed Chile Relleno.  Let me tell you...IT IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I'VE EVER HAD!!!  Oh, I eat here at least every few months for the Chile Relleno.  :)  The last time I went to Z Tejas, I went to the patio with my sister where there were some flirts telling us how pretty we are.  If you like more of the social appeal, I would recommend the patio, but if you like more of a romantic or personal appeal, I would recommend eating inside the restaurant.
