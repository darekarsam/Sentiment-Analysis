5	I recently moved to Charlotte and I was looking for a nail salon to get a mani and pedi. I'm so happy I stopped at Lefi. I loved, loved the manicure and pedicure they gave me. They took their time and gave me the longest and best massages. The also add paraffin to their pedicure for no extra charge. I will definitely recommend this place, not only they give great service but they are super friendly.
4	Great value. I think this will become a regular place for me. Rebecca was great! I loved the long massage, and paraffin wax treatment, which I never got in any swanky Ballantyne/Southpark basic pedi that costs $20 more. The place is not fancy, but their service is outstanding. My one small complaint was that the chair was well-used and maybe not the most comfortable, but the massage feature worked just fine!
5	BEST NAIL EXPERIENCE EVER!!! With nail salons, I usually experience friendly, but not great work or excellent work and not too friendly or a little bit of both , but not a great atmosphere! This encompassed all 3! The paraffin (no extra charge), large massage chair, very attentive and detailed pedicure, affordable pricing  and the exceptionally friendly service made the experience 5 stars! This will be the only salon I use for for mani, pedi and waxing. A little bit hard to find (across from Carolina place mall on 51, in the K-mart/Best Buy strip mall).. GO NOW!
4	My toes look GREAT, the staff is super nice! This is my first visit....I decided to join my friend (it's her Birthday) Personally I only visit nail salons that use Tub liners, which this place doesn't....so my search will continue.
