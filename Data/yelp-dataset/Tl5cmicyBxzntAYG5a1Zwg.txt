1	We reserved a mid size car to travel to Death Valley for the day.  The rate was outrageous ($75.00) for the day because NASCAR was coming to town.  OK I should have taken the price on hotwire in Feb for $15...that's on me.  When we arrived we were advised that the car had to be washed before we returned it.  Can you imagine?  The car itself was dirty when we picked it up.  It had stains on the seats, dirt all over the car and french fries in the back seat.  But fearing the $175 penalty if we returned the car dirty, we drove around for an hour looking for the car wash.  That's right, they didn't give us directions with the map.  They just drew a circle around the area where the car wash was.  Horrible.  I would have walked away or at least rented from somewhere else if I'd known before picking up the car.  DO NOT RENT FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!!
1	It was really hard to find the location of this place and once we did, the agent was unpleasant and annoyed that we couldn't hear her over the cleaning guy banging around in the corner. The rate was super expensive and the tank wasn't even full when we picked up our vehicle: fail Avis.
1	Total and Complete Rip-off!!!  They'll check you in and direct you to your car.  You return car and drop keys.  Your estimate is on initial receipt.  The total bill on my credit card was $60 higher than the guestimate and this was for a 7 hour rental.  I am at a loss as to what they added...I took out complete coverage.  They kept insisting to look at piece of paper saying they will charge $25 cleaning...I left it cleaner than when I got it.  I wrote a complaint through the Avis web-site, but am not optimistic on resolution.  Avis joins Budget for 2 companies not to rent from.
