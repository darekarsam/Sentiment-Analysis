1	I like to support the small, local businesses, but I would recommend against this one.  They had set up our security system upon the building of our home, and so we maintained them for monitoring.  Although, the monitoring has very little maintenance, I'm always very skeptical with the monitoring.  Rarely do we receive calls when our alarm is tripped.  We have mentioned this to them on each occasion, with no resolution to the issue.  Howard (the manager) is, to say the least, inconsiderate, rude, dishonest, demeaning, and not knowledgable.  We just could not trust him and had several bad encounters with him - displaying the above.  The system that they have is from the 1990's, maybe even the 1980's and need to be updated to at least a 21st century security sytem.  We were so disappointed that we had to cancel our contract and pay a fee, of which they havee you for either 5 or 10 years (check the fine print).  On a good note, Jeff (tec hnician) is excellent, trustworthy, and very responsible - and should consider joining a more reputable company.
