5	Best place for eyebrow wax and eyelashes! I love that this salon is locally owned and operated. Yadira is who I go to and she is not only an excellent make-up artist, but her attention to detail when it comes to waxing my eyebrows, is hands down the best! They offer an extensive list of services from permanent make-up, make-up application to hair services. I've only had brow wax, eyelash application and make-up done here but I have friends and family that are regulars for their hair services & they always look fabulous! This place has great prices, awesome hours (they are always open), centrally located,  walk-ins are accepted however I recommend making an appointment because Yadira is in high demand.

5	I absolutely love this salon. I have been in search of someone that will listen too what I want and isn't in a hurry to cut my hair. These women are amazing. My hair looks great and even healthier. Best part my hair looks good even after leaving the salon. Prices are extremely affordable and the customer service is fantastic!
