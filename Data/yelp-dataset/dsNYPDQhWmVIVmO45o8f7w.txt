1	Do you want substandard care? Do you want to be in pain while recovering from major surgery and not get pain medication or have an incompetent doctor tell you that any other pain is "just stress?" Then by all means, go here. If you want somewhere where they actually care about you, then DEFINITELY go somewhere else. This place is lousy, understaffed, and you have to wait forever for them to answer your call light. Run far away from here.
4	Dad spent almost a month here and we were really happy with his care. From the physical therapists, to the case manager, nurses, aides, food attendants and housekeeping; everyone was kind and went out of their way to make it a pleasant experience for Dad. Interestingly, the nursing aids dictate their notes and wear headsets. This keeps them at the patients bedside instead of some remote location charting.  La Estancia was clean and efficient and I  recommend this place to others.
4	I was not a patient; I just checked this place out with a friend. I will update this review after a few days. As of this writing, I was told this location was recently bought by a management company based in Nevada. The admission lady that helped my friend and I today was awesome! Her name was Angela D. She gave us a complete tour and answered all of our questions.My friend was referred to this location by a friend from her church that used to work here.
