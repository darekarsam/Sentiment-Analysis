5	Charming and truly unique event space perfect for intimate gatherings. I couldn't stop oohing and awing over all the charming decorative touches!And once I met Lauren, I knew I had to work with her on my upcoming event. She was so easy to work with and committed to making our event a success. Her love for the space, the neighborhood, and the city were also obvious and she's exactly the kind of local business owner I want to see succeeding here!Point Breezeway is filling a need in Pittsburgh for venue space that is personal, beautiful, affordable, and easily accessible.
5	Awe inspiring event space.  You can feel the warmth and comfort the moment you walk in.  And the host, Lauren, goes above and beyond expectations. I would highly recommend booking an event here
5	Oh.my.god, this place is so adorable it's like you've stepped right into Pinterest!In a perfect world, this is how my house would look!  My friend had her baby shower there this Sunday and it is just the most charming, perfect, adorable venue.  I didn't even know this place existed, but from now on I'll be holding every event here.I cannot more highly recommend this venue, it is a true hidden gem out by Frick Park.  I can't wait to come back here.
