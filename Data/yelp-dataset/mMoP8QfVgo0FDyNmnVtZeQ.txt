3	Wanted a Pedicure and figured I'd give this place a try since it was across the street from my hotel.
5	So, I walked into this place in a hurry to get a mani done for my mother in law and my self, they offered the shellic nail polish service and I opted for that, the ladies are super nice and very talkative. So I get my mani done and within the hour my mani starts peeling off, I was upset, my mother in laws manicure was flawless, til this day its awesome, but mine, not so much. Tech's fault... maybe, my fault... possibly.... I called the salon, spoke with the owner who didnt question my actions, she apologized and offered to either give me my money back or redo my manicure... i was FLOORED, Ive had horrible expiriences with salons, if there ever is a complain, they always make me feel like its my fault, but this place did the complete opposite. I feel that this is the way a customer should be treated. So based one the AWESOME customer service and the fact that my mother in laws mani was perfect is why im giving this place a high review... Im getting my mani redone today, Ill post back the results.If your in the area, please give this place a try :)******3.14.13 UPDATE*******So I went to get my mani re-done and as expected it went perfect.... this place is out of my way but its so worth the trip. Please check them out.
4	Will definitely come back whenever in the area! Fast and friendly, reasonable prices, and very clean with minimal odor when I came in (sat am) see my other post. Recommend the Epic mani pedi for a real spa treatment! If you can call and make an appointment or you may have to wait a little
