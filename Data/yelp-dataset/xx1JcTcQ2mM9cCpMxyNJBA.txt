1	Absolutely disgusting!!!Tried to re-serve food that was incorrectly served to, and touched by, another patron, and was then subsequently rifled through by the employee that mis-served it. After being called out, the employee tried to deny that she had done it, and management refunded the money, and SWORE, that nothing like that would ever happen again. When asked how he could insure that, he shrugged his shoulders, told me that the money had been returned, and that I could have a good day...knowing too well that no reprimand, training, or further influence would be put upon the offending employee. I know it's fast food, and that you get what you pay for, but I grew up working in a similar restaurant to earn money when I was a kid.  We took pride back then. I actually think this is a comment about the nature of the new work force.  Quite shocking and disappointing, even for a low level fast food restaurant.
1	The worst case of customer service ever. I have came here often and its horrible. The staff has the worst attitude, it takes extremely long and they don't pay attention
5	Work close by so I come by quite a bit. Siera is what makes this burger king the best one! Her customer service skills are amazing and it is almost shocking that she is not working in a five star restaurant!
