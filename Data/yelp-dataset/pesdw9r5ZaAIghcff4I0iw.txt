5	Biggest Dutch Bros! Busy but the line moves pretty fast. Friendly workers kept us company in the drive-thru during their grand opening today.
5	Great place and very enthusiastic employees. As an introvert I don't like how "friendly" they are, but I love the coffee here and now use them as a "social training regimen". Their stamp/punch cards are a WAY better deal than you get at Starbucks, and they give free stuff. We've already got a "Dutch Mafia" hat!OK, free stuff and enthusiastic people are just extras, the coffee is still the reason we go here. We were pretty diehard Starbucks people (we have the cups, Gold cards, buy their coffee beans, bla bla bla) -- but, now that Dutch Bros is popping up in more convenient locations...... might lose my Gold Card status.
5	I have been waiting for this location to open and when I drove by this weekend and saw it was finally open, I had to go! It has only been open for a week & so far everything seems to be going great. I went late in the afternoon so there wasn't a long wait. The employees are super friendly & happy to be working there. I got the iced white chocolate mocha and needless to say, it was delicious. Highly recommend Dutch bros! I'd much rather have DB vs sbux.
5	I had never been to a Dutch Brothers before but one just opened up near my house and upon my daughters insistence we went. Best service I think I have ever had!  Not only was one person friendly but everyone was super friendly. I have never had an experience like that at any food/drink establishment!  And of course the drinks were delicious! ! Good job Dutch Bros on hiring great young people!
