5	Do you have a printer that will design and deliver on 4th of July weekend?  I do. Jeff worked all weekend to design, print and deliver a rush job for me. He has done all of my business and personal printing for the past 5 years. Always on time and on budget. Business cards, stickers, uniforms and more. This company is the best in Vegas.
5	We ordered folders for a convention that had to be printed in California due to the custom nature of them.  Due to a locked warehouse and lack of forklift operator they weren't able to reach our folders that were shipped to Las Vegas.   Jeff stayed late and hand delivered our product to my door step so that our company would have the folders in time for a convention the next day.I can not speak highly enough about Jeff and Corri, they did a stellar job and we will be using them for all our printing needs in the future.
5	These guys are great.  Their prices are very affordable and turn around time is super fast.  I highly recommend!
