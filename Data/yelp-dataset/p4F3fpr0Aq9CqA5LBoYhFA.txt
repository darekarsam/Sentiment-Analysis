4	My son has big feet...15 men...almost 6 feet tall, so funding and finding his shoes is a job all by itself.We didn't find anything here, but the staff is really helpful and seemed to care that I get something that worked for him, not merely make the sale.We found nice shin guards and he was stoked! They have an excellent selection of athletic apparel, in general and soccer stuff in particular.We went in close to closing time, but the staff was as helpful as if the shift had just started.Having this sporting goods store is awesome...selection is good and since I am getting email promotions from them, I can save a buck or two & not have to hump it to Avondale anymore. So that makes me stoked also.I only took the 5th star due to not having his size. I think the store should at least have an option for folks needing larger shoes...
5	Stopped into this new location today for a pair of their Rugged Exposure Journey Plus walking shoes.  I've been buying shoes at Big 5 for many years & have always done well with them...  This variety, for example, are comfortable right from the start & last me a couple of years.  That's better performance for $20 than I get from Florsheim's that cost $100!     :-))
3	Smaller location than other Big5's, some staff seem lost but overall friendly. They need more spanish speaking employees because of the large amount of hispanic residents near that location. We are becoming bilingual america weather people like it or not sooooo... thats all I have to say. Other than that, great speacials and some cute staff.. one tall dude I saw once.. he was cute. (wink) Just one think, I encountered a rude manager, kinda tall and chunky, bald. He was a little too sarcastic for my taste.
