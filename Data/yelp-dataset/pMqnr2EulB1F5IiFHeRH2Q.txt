3	Since the demise of PostNet on King Street in Waterloo we've been taking our FedEx packages here.  The lineups can be very long, but have improved somewhat over the past few months.  But it is more than a place to ship packages...  This place used to be called Kinkos and is a full service print shop as well.  The prices are high, but they do provide longer hours than most print shops in town.

They charge for time on the self-printing computers, and for the number of black and coloured pages you print.As for their binding services, they are quick and reliable. Only once have they told me to pick up my report later. This was due to a large number of binding jobs ahead of me. That's fair. It is right next to a university. You never know when a whole class is going drop by needing to have their reports bound.
