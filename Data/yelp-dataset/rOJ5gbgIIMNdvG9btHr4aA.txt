1	This company was honestly a complete waste of time and money for my husband and I. Lots of claims made up front with little to no follow through. We most certainly did not get our money back as the 100% money back guarantee claimed. Don't even bother!
1	This is honestly the biggest scam I have ever seen.  Took $400.00 cash payment in their office as Paul Newman and his secretary did a great acting job.  They claim to know people with credit agencies and collection agencies to remove negative credit.  Tell you to sign up for some online shopping scam to raise your credit.  It has been 9 months they have done absolutely nothing.  The owner called to tell me that his secretary had several strokes and she just wasn't right since and he would take on my case personally!!!  HE IS A SCAM ARTIST!  I was told he does classes on repairing your credit that is why we used him.  Will not return calls or e-mails!!!
1	Got scammed and lost money, can't believe I paid for their services and out of 8 negative items they only negotiated 2 when I paid for all 8. What a shameful company and individuals! I'm going to file a complaint.
