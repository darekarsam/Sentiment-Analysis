3	This is a great place to get all kinds of bar food, and to make you feel better about eating it, everything here is freshly prepared (they don't use frozen or canned food).  I recommend the burger, chicken caesar wrap, and the chicken fingers basket.  They are open for lunch, dinner, and late-night. The food is great, and they have have decent drink specials (if nothing else Coor's Light draft is always a $1.50).  The only negative I have about this place is that since they are a new restaurant they seem a little overwhelmed.  It can get really crowded, especially on game day, and the service can be really slow.  After living next to Ed's for the last several months, I will add that I think the service has gotten worse, something always seems to be wrong.  Also, because of decent drink prices, there are a lot of douche bags here on thurs-sat nights.  Oh, and if you sit at a table at night, don't go to the bar to order your drinks or the waitres will get pissed!
4	It's a relaxed atmosphere when it's not too crowded.  Johnny Walker, Dewars and Chivas Regal are the only Scotch whisky selections which is unfortunate.  Lots of TV screens for your favorite games.  But I go there because the bartenders are easy going and like to have fun guessing who just played what song on the juke box.  In this neighborhood, unless I'm craving a burger at Big Daddy's, I actually prefer Ed's to anything on East Boulevard because it's low-key.  East Boulevard focuses too much on frills and you can't sit and relax at Big Daddy's because it's always packed.  Rightly so because the food is great and desperately needed along that strip.  But Ed's burgers are still great, the crumbly-around-the-edges kind, and appropriately salted.  Their slightly seasoned fries are addictive.  And Comet Grill is ten paces away if you're vegetarian if you prefer to dine there first and then have drinks at Ed's.  Both Ed's and Comet Grill are adjacent to the Bloom parking lot.
2	Ehhhhhhhhhhhhh.  That's about all I can say.  Definitely sports oriented and so damn crowded on the weekends it's not even funny.  We got harrassed by some weird guy on the back patio last time we were there who would not leave us alone.  I think there are better places in Charlotte to hang out especially if you don't live near this place.  A neighborhood fave I'm sure, but not for me.
3	Ed's is a your typical neighborhood sports bar. It's packed during football games and other big sporting events. And you'll find what you'd expect on those days - lots of obnoxious drunk guys.But I recently went there on a sunny Thursday afternoon and had a great time sitting on the back patio. I tried the veggie wrap and the mozzarella sticks for an appetizer. Both were delicious.
3	Ed's Place is cool.  A neighborhood spot definitely, and they have some delicious beer.  I stopped in the other day, mid-October, grabbed a "Kind Beer" a high gravity beer and sat outside at the picnic tables enjoying this tasty brew and the Charlotte Fall weather.  The "Kind Beer" was inexpensive and very kind, with a taste similar to Sierra Nevada, but with much more of a punch.My friend and I made this our first stop on a little trek I like to call "The Bike Bar Crawl" which basically consists of bars I can ride my beach cruiser to, Ed's Place was stop numero uno. Keep your eyes open for stop 2 and see if you can connect the dots....P.S. it might be in reverse.
1	Normally I have no problems with Ed's Tavern, but the lack of service today was pretty bad. My friend & I sat at the bar around 12:30 & were left high & dry for about eight minutes. Being quite hungry & thirsty, we decided to leave & go somewhere else. I was really looking forward to a bunch of delicious hot wings and vodka drinks at Ed's today, but the staff on hand did not provide those things. I'd really hate to cross Ed's off my list, but if the service is as bad the next time as is was today I certainly will.
4	$1.50 Coors Light Pints everyday.  Chicken sandwich with cucumber salad to eat.
3	Went to Ed's on Thursday night for general trivia.  Website said it started at 8p, when we got there the boards said 9p, trivia man started at 8:38p.Food: pretty good bar food.  I had a buffalo chicken wrap and sweet potato fries.Drinks: excellent beer list with many options on tap.Atmosphere: big space, good location, pool tables and outdoor areas.Service: good service, friendly staff.Trivia: Half the people in the place weren't really playing and rules weren't that strict so I think there were some cheaters texting friends and what not.  If you are a stickler for game-focus and rules then you should probably avoid.
4	I think Ed's is a great neighborhood bar to go watch the game and relax.  The TV's are pretty good for a bar and they usually have some kind of band on the weekends if you like live music.  The beer specials are really good.  I think Coors Light is on tap for $1.50 everyday so you definitely can't beat that.  They also have other premium beers at very reasonable prices.  I have only eaten here a time or two, mostly just go there to hang out with friends and have a few beers.  I did recently have the Spicy Roast Beef Sandwich special for $6 and I have to say it was really good.  Buttery toasted bread, warm roast beef with melted cheese and some kind of spicy sauce that was excellent.  It also came with fresh made potato chips.  I was impressed to say the least!
3	I think Ed's may be one of the only true neighborhood bars in Charlotte. They have very good bar food at a decent price. They also have a good beer list. They are always having some great specials as well. I have been to there trivia a couple times and it is usually packed. The trivia is one of the best around. We really emjoy playing there Sappo game over there. If you have been there before and never seen it, it's in the corner next to the pool tables. Dont be afraid to try it with some friends. It is a really cool bar game. Ed's tends to be steadily busy every night and the servers are always great.
3	Tap menu is great, gets super busy 8p-11p. 2 pool tables, trivia weds and thurs. Bar food is average. Clientle is 21-32 year olds. Have always had problems here with jerk guys, but the staff is always good about giving idiots the boot.Never would choose to go here, but if everyone else wants to go, just rest assured you'll have a great beer!
4	Awesome happy hour bar, late night bar and everything in between!  Go Friday nights and they will have a live band (but it is always too loud for this old lady's ears!)  The food here is fantastic, I have had the chicken wrap and it is always a ton of food for not a lot of money.  There are fun arcade-type games in the back and plenty of seating.  They always have really sweet bartenders and servers.  Love this place!!!
3	Ed's isn't my top choice for a night out. But on a Wednesday or Thursday, I occasionally get coaxed into going for trivia. Is everyone probably cheating? Yes, more than likely...but it's never a bad idea to utilize your brain cells whilst drowning them with alcohol. Great beer selection - food is your standard bar food. It's a bit divey but comfortable, and full of regulars (urban professional crowd). Expect a (somewhat reasonable) wait time at the bar...for such a busy place I never see more than two bartenders.
5	Always a good place to grab a snacka and a cold beer. Last night I took a friend from Oregon to bar and we had the wings. They were great. Meaty cooked just right. They have an interesting flavor "Blackened Parmesan Cheese"... TASTY, just the right amount of spice and cheesy flavor.My wife LOVES the homemade Hungarian Cucumber Salad. Great selection of beer and the place is just hopping on Thursday nights and through the weekend.Will be back again and again.
4	This is a great place if you're just looking to chill with a group of friends. It get's fairly busy on Wednesday and Thursday nights for trivia from about 9:00 to 11:00. There is a smaller crowd there on Friday and Saturday nights. On Saturday nights they usually have a small band. The food is just above average for bar food.  They have about 10 decent size flat screen TV's but the picture quality isn't that great. They usually don't turn the sound on for games. They have a back deck/patio and a small front patio with cornhole. They have two pool tables, a few video games, and lots of checker boards. The crowd is usually mid 20's to mid 30's.The best thing about this bar is the $1.75 coors light drafts.
4	Mmmm mmm chicken wings! probably some of the best wings I've ever had; so flavorful, so delicious. Ed's is a good low-key hangout; the perfect place to kill that midweek mundanity (if that's even a word!) But you know exactly what I mean. On a Wednesday evening, when you're getting out of work, a chilled beer, some wings or a burger, and some music trivia in a friendly, lively environment is just what you need to lift your spirits... and that's exactly what you'll find at Ed's!
3	Bring back DISCO FRIES!!!
5	ED'S TAVERN...... = CHEER'Si go enough and taken enough friends where they call me the Mayor!I'm more of a "shot" taker than a Drink Drinker. (quick and to the point). anyway... They are poured into a Nice Ball glass. When i first started coming here i thought the bartender was just blessing me (for a better tip). When he sat it down and walked off, i felt on top of the Bar (world). Unnnnntil i see him pour the same kinda shot to everyone else. HMMMMM maybe its not me!! lol*********************** BEER *****************good choice of beer's, on tap, bottles, can (12oz & Tall Boys)Good specials on beers & drinks (daily) Colddddd beerNot watered down cocktailsA wide selection of Liq. ********************** Bartenders/Waitress *****************Smiling FacesI think its a Bartender named Mike that must be Russian (no smiles..EVER!!)A Lot of blondes "bouncing" around the place to give it a "Hooters" effect.Always happy to help********************** FOOD *******************I don't expect much from Bars when it comes to bar food. So i usually order Wings & Fries (you have to work HARD to mess that up). But I've seen other ppl's orders come out and they look pretty good.... CONSIDERING(I come to drink and maybe eat... so i'm only giving a review of the food and service.. not the "night life")
5	The fact that I'm here (average) twice a week might have more to do with proximity than affection, but if this place weren't awesome, I'd go elsewhere.Great selection of draft beers (including the wonderful 1.75 coors light).The bar food is good.  I'm partial to the App Sampler (especially at half price on Fridays) and definitely the sliders.Also, if you're planning on taking the Wing Challenge - don't sit near me - kthx.
4	This is where my best friend and I go on Wednesdays. The standing daily drink specials are fantastic ($2.75 for Killian's on draft and good shot specials, too) and the atmosphere is great. The back patio is big, so you can bring a group if you like, but it's just fine for two or three as well. (Plenty of seating, plenty of room to stand.) And the inside is ENORMOUS with decent billiards and a couple of good arcade games. Plus on Wednesdays there's music trivia. (Live music Fridays, too!)I've never eaten here, so I can't attest to the quality of the food, but the service and drinks are awesome. Highly recommend for any crowd.
4	Gave trivia night another shot at Ed's... I think last time the trivia was a bit hard and it was hard to not notice the scores of people looking up answers on their smart phones.  Luckily the phone policy has been "reinforced" or it seemed like it was.  Trivia should be better if you actually know the answers!  Not how well you can use your smart phone.Anyways - I got there early and ate at the bar waiting for my friends to show up.  The barkeeps were nice and also let me change a tv to watch a different sport than they had up there.  They have a ton of tvs so it's hard to miss any sort of sports action going on.Had the fish tacos, which were nice... I liked that the tacos were "pre-limed" so it had a good citrus kick to it (without having to get your fingers all limey).  Maybe it's just the laziness in me, but I appreciate when the chef/cook/kitchen says, "this is what you are eating... you have no options"  I think there is a boldness about it.  From there it can go either two ways - you absolutely hate what was given to you, or bask in it's greatness.My side was the cucumber salad... which I didn't care for.... sliced cucumbers with paprika and vinegar... was a bit soggy and sad.  I did eat it all (begrudgingly) .Trivia was fun and we even won a round of beers!  Definitely will return.
4	Great place for drinks and fun! They have a nice patio out back and seating outfront, large on the inside. They have *excellent* drink specials and a good amount of TVs to watch the games. They have pool, corn hole, skee ball, basketball and a few other games, also have a checkers bar so you can sit drink and play. Their food is decent, I usually stick to burgers/wings.
4	I thoroughly enjoyed stopping by Ed's for a night cap. I enjoyed the atmosphere, they have a pretty good beer selection, the service was friendly & the live music was great. I want to go back to try the trivia & will definitely keep Ed's in mind the next time we're out in the Dilworth/Sedgefield area!
4	I really like Ed's.  They have great bar food and awesome drink specials.  I love being able to sit in a booth and relax or if I am in a social mood grab one of the high top tables. They have pool tables and often have live music.  When they do its always been great!
4	I live within walking distance to Ed's and I haven't been there too often; however, I have become a sucker for their wings.  I love their Blackened Parm. wings.  Such a great flavor and their ranch dressing is just yummy!  Whenever I'm craving wings, I head to Ed's!
4	I went here on a Tuesday night, late in the evening. The place was pretty lively and played some good music, with people belting out their favorite cheesy ballads. I had an order of chicken tenders with fries and honey mustard - all of which were superb and mouth-scaldingly fresh! The chicken tenders were not your typical crusty hunks of batter with a little bit of meat in the middle - they were very meaty with a crispy, light coating that had flavorful seasoning. They also had a pretty solid beer selection, even featuring the elusive Red Oak (which I ordered, filled to the brim of the glass). The waitress was very nice and attentive but not annoying. I also enjoyed their pool tables and a game of giant Jenga! Would recommend for anyone looking to go somewhere laid-back and fun with better-than-average bar food.
1	I know this is a popular neighborhood stomping ground for some. And honestly I like the low key vibe, just chilling' kinda joints. Drinks here are affordable.  All in all not bad of a hangout.  It can get super loud when a band is playing (they should reconsider having just acoustic live music, or at least not a full drum set as an alternative to going deaf).So why 1 star?  Well, after witnessing a beat down delivered by an employee against a patron, I honestly don't have anything good to say about this place. (This said event took place before the new year FYI)After several bad press events last year (including a death), you would think someone would care about the reputation and image of the business.  All I know is while I was standing around near the bar, a loud commotion took place at the middle table (where the checker boards table top are). The door/bar back guy punched the guy who was sitting there in the face so hard, there were blood splattered across almost the length of that long table.  The wife was screaming. The rest of the bar male employees jumped on in and dragged this one guy out to the back. Gosh knows what happened to that man.  Wife was hysterical, and she kept being yelled at by the male employees while she repeatedly said stop beating him he didnt do anything.  WTH just happened?! Then it gets better.  The guy who did the face punching now storming back in and yelling at everyone on his way, including me and the people I was standing with, for standing around.  He yelled "this is not your f-king living room, get the f out of the way". Hmm... This is a bar, people stand around in a bar.  Am I the delusional one?  So I could only guessed that he punched someone because that someone was in his way, didn't move and might have mouthed back. My thing is, if you don't like dealing with people, especially intoxicated people, don't work at a bar.  There is ZERO reason why any employee should or need to punch anyone. Management, if you are reading, please don't hire people who have anger management issue. IT IS NOT OKAY, and ganging up on one person isn't okay either.  I go to bars to have fun and enjoy myself.  And I was quite scared and pissed off by that night event.   Maybe they can put up a sign "Come here at your own risk..."
4	Great atmostphere! great bar food! if you get the chicken wings ask for extra wing sauce.
4	Great beer prices, great selection, surprisingly good food. Never been there for late night but during the afternoon things are tame, cops are patrons, and we get good service a good experience for a good price. Nothing amazing but reliability and value go a long ways.
5	Perfect watering hole.   Great food and drinks...always a good spot to start, end or spend an evening.
4	A real dive bar in the heart of rich people. You might recognize it from homeland. Brody tells mike it's ok to give his wife the business. It has the widest bar I have ever seen it's about 3 feet. Good beer selection with plenty of local nc beers. Good food I like the wings and the backyard burger. The waitstaff is nice and the keep tabs on you which is big for me. We don't come here as much as I would like hopefully that will change!
3	This place is pretty descent. The best night of the week is Wednesday Night when they have music trivia from 9pm-11pm. You can have as many people on your team that you want, cell phones are not permitted, and there is always a theme! There is 3-rounds of challenging songs for you to guess the title and artist: first round is pretty easy, second gets more challenging, and the third is when you send up one person from your team to face off at who's the quickest to say the correct artist out loud! The host is great and I love that no matter what creative team name you come up with he must say it! And trust me people get creative.Team Names I've Heard Used Here: My Grandma can't fight, but you should see her boxI like my President like I like my coffeeDrinks Are On the House TonightMy Couch Pulls Out But I Don'tI wish this microphone was a dickTitanic Swim TeamI didn't slap you, I just high-fived your faceI Twittered All Over Her FacebookI like my president like I like my coffeeI'm not gay, but 5 bucks is 5 bucks*Best Tip for this place: They have a Banana Beer on Draft, You're welcome.
4	Went here on Thursday for trivia night. This place has a laid back vibe and was pretty crowded on trivia night. I only tried the hummus plate but it was not bad. All the food looked like good bar food. They have a lot of local beers as well as specials, friendly service too.Part of an episode of Homeland was also filmed here too so that was pretty neat!update: have been multiple times since and have tried many of their appetizers and i have not been disappointed. if friend pickles are your thing you should get some here
4	My fiance and I live down the street, and subsequently spend Friday nights and Sunday mornings at Eds. Their brunch is AMAZING and I'd argue its the best in Charlotte. While the brunch menu is quite limited, the eggs are incredible. Naturally I was eavesdropping a few weeks ago and heard the patrons behind me say that Ed's get their eggs from a local farm. You can tell. The full lunch/dinner menu is pretty good as well. My fiance says they have the best wings he's ever had. My only complaint is that we have waited FOREVER on multiple occasions. If you're in a rush, you might want to think twice. We waited over 30 minutes for our brunch last weekend when there were only a handful of tables open. I'm not sure if its a waitress issue or a kitchen issue, but we've started just sitting at the bar with our favorite waitress (tall, skinny, funny brunette)  who always seems to get our food out right and on time. Sit at the bar if you're in a hurry or don't want to deal with a messed up order.
4	A friend took me to this bar recently. The bar has a very chill feel to it-great collection of beers on the tap including local brews..Definitely try the Dunkel & Mexicala..The bartenders are also pretty hot if that helps :)
5	Okay, so it has taken me forever to get out to this place but finally made it a few days ago. It's strange that others have some terrible reviews of this place and from what I hear around town a lot of people certainly don't speak as highly about their experiences here compared to mine. We were here on a Wednesday which is apparently one of TWO weekly trivia events held here. The crowd was pretty large but everyone had a table and it didn't seem overcrowded. It's actually worth mentioning that we never once felt we were neglected by our server. In fact, our server offered some of the better service I've experienced in quite some time. We were always asked if we needed an another beer at the perfect time and checked on just enough times without being annoying.The food here exceeded our expectations by quite a bit. I split the Bleu Cheese Burger and an order of chicken tenders tossed in their hottest hot sauce. As far as I'm concerned they nailed both of these orders. Apparently the burgers are all made in-house (not frozen patties from a distributor) and it certainly made a difference. Flavor of the burger and the addition of the blue cheese was great. The tenders were great as well and I don't think I'd ever recommend tenders without tossing them in some type of sauce.As for the atmosphere, which I've heard many complain specifically about, I personally saw no problem and actually had a good experience here. It wasn't super dark like many bars of the same caliber in town, the service was great, the food was good and it wasn't super loud at any point. I'll need to pop in here on a weekend to see if the vibe is any different as I'd expect it to be vs. a Wednesday but in general very pleased with this place for a bite to eat and a few beer.Oh! And it's worth mentioning that it looks like they have some pretty great deals on beer as well as a pretty good selection. Monday's are 1/2 of Drafts AND the same goes for Tuesdays.
4	Great food and great drink choices. This place used to be one of my favorite bars. It kind of has a divey-sports bar feel (but very clean). The regulars used to be 20-somethings just looking to chill, but the crowd has gotten a lot older and in my opinion, a lot more boring. It is a nice spot to grab a drink and dinner, but it is now more of a 30 and 40-something professional bar. Trivia and Music Trivia are ok, but they take way too long between rounds and it starts really late.
4	Eds is a solid place to go to eat and drink. I went for trivia night and it was a total blast. Great drink specials and the quesadillas are bomb. The service is kind of slow though. I will be back to Eds again for trivia and the awesome quesadillas!
4	Great neighborhood hang out! Definitely a locals place and usually packed on evenings and weekends. Decent craft beer selection with a couple dozen on draft and several bottle selections too. Food is also very good but typical bar fare.
4	Like to play games? Watch sports? Eat? Drink beer? Live music? Trivia? Take honey bun shots? Here's the place to do it all.My crew ventures here often. Our latest adventure was Saturday afternoon. March Madness on the TVs, 30-some year olds gambling over who's better at the hoop shoot out game. If a read head named Ford challenges you, run. He's automatic at that game. Checkers, skee ball, pool, Kenny Floyd providing the tunes. A good time as always.We are huge fans of the Sapo frog coin toss game. We'll spend hours playing. Addictive. I've yet to see anyone actually get it in the frog's mouth. TWSS?What to order: I love the wings and the fish tacos. I don't recommend the cucumber salad. Not the best. Trivia on Wednesday and Thursday nights. Music on Wednesday, general on Thursday. Get there early to grab a table. I consider myself a somewhat intelligent person. I did not feel that way after a night of general trivia. Live music on Fridays and Saturdays.Great beer selection. Food and drink specials throughout the week. Ed's even has an app you can download for the latest on that.Just a short cab ride from uptown and South End, Ed's is a solid spot in the heart of Dilworth.
5	All of the other reviews do a really good job covering this place. When a friend recommended it I was not sure what to expect. I came away very impressed.
4	Good food, nice people..the waitress was amazingly friendly and attentive. The beer was a little warm for my taste..Beer on tap should be below 40 degrees. my guestimation would be about 45 degrees?
5	I left Charlotte 7 months ago and every weekend I try to find a neighborhood gem that compares to Ed's. Ed's was and is my favorite bar. Coors light always on special made drinking all day at a bar with friends a fun experience that wouldn't empty the savings account. I spent every Panthers away game there. Saturday college football was perfect at Eds. They never let one team hog too many of the TVs. It's what a sports bar should be. Oh yea the wings were solid too.
5	Best bar ever! We come here every time we are in town. Great beers on tap. Lots of IPAs, which I love! Hot bartenders, especially Jodene. And they have pop shot basketball!!! What's not to like...
2	If you want to drink a beer and watch a game, this is a good place for you if you're in Dilworth. However, if you're not close to the area and/or are looking to eat, there are far better places to spend your money. My friend and I went in for a game recently. We sat down at a dirty table (it was busy and someone just left). When our waitress finally appeared we asked her to clean it. She appears moment later and thoughtlessly sprayed both of our phones in plain sight with whatever cleaner they use to wipe down the previous patron's muck. Didn't apologize, just mindlessly went about doing what I assumed she thought was someone else's job. Now, I can completely understand if a place is slammed like this one was and not getting the fastest service, but our waitress spent time hobnobbin' with her other tables like she was working at Hooters. We were there over two hours and I bet she came to the table three times (someone else brought us our food). Hey, that's not enough to give the place a bad review -- there are good and bad apples in any establishment; I'm giving these guys two stars based on the quality of the food alone. It's easy to pour a beer and that seems to be the level of competence they require in the kitchen. On par with a heat-lamp'd McDonalds' burger. Rubbery. Flavorless. Is this even real meat? My buddy got the wings. We both felt a little queasy afterwards. He doesn't care to go back, but I say trust 'em with the beer. They do have a good selection of drafts and those are reasonably priced. The atmosphere's good if you're into the sports bar vibe.
4	For what it advertises, Ed's delivers. Good drink deals, solid bar food, and some decent bar games. The Waitress was great and very attentive, going as far as bringing my beer outside. The bar could use a few more TVs, a shuffle board table, but all in all its a solid neighborhood spot.
