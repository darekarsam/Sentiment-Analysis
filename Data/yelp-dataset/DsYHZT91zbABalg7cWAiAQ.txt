1	Not impress at all.  atmosphere was terrible. Country should not be on the schedule.  Waitress was ok, think that there was only one, security had to help clear the tables.  Not sure why the pool tables were not moved,  there was never a problem with the people playing pool.  The band was good.  You can keep it has a Irish pub will never be back.  Also we were shot around 30.00 at the bar.
1	The worst service I have ever had, the bartenders have no clue how to give proper service.It was not even busy so I really don't understand why service was so bad, other then they are not trained properly.
1	One of the drunk locals fell into our table and spilt our drinks, the whole place and the bathroom was filthy, country band was one dimensional and most of the woman patrons were like the beer there, cheap.
