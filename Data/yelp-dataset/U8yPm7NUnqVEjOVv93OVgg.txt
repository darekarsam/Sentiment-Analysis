3	Been with this UPS store for over two years. MELISSA is ALWAYS rude on the phone.
5	I love the UPS. Great customer service and I always go to them for all my shipping needs.
1	Needed to send a fax quickly. The two employees that were working were both very bored looking. Did not greet me when I entered the mostly empty store. The female asian employee was rude when I asked her about faxing.  I felt very unwelcome and I will not be returning.
1	If I could this place a 0 stars I would. The checkout guys james was terrible. He wanted to close the store 10 minutes early and told me he couldn't open the register up. After threatening to discuss the practice with his boss he opened the register to resume business. He then quoted me 1000 for sending a 5lb package from Las Vegas to California(northern). This place should be closed for fraud and I will be reporting them to the better business bureau.  By the way, the staffer that closed on Sunday October 19, 2014 specifically said. "The owner can go f!@ themselves, I just work here.  Have a good day."  Wow!
