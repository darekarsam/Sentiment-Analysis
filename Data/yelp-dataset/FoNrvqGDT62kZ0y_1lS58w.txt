5	I've been going to Dr. Oswald for years now, and my kids see him too.  He's a really nice guy and does great work.  The staff is friendly and good with the kids, too - never a tear.
5	Dr Oswald has been my dentist for many years. I have complete trust and faith in Dr Oswald. He is thorough, patient and explains everything. He is very calm and mild mannered which is something I appreciate in a dentist. He puts you at ease from the moment you get in the chair. The office staff is super friendly. One thing that Dr Oswald does that is rare these days is calls you the night of any procedure. I find this very comforting. I completely recommend Dr Oswald and Red Canyon Dentistry!
5	I live in North Scottsdale and it's worth driving all the way down here. Dr Oswald is excellent, as is the whole staff. Scheduling/billing and everything else is a breeze. They've taken care of some things that my previous dentists have let slide. I've gotten a couple of onlays and filling replacements that are working out much better. Highly recommended!
