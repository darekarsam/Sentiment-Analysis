2	There are only two things I look for in a liquor store: Price and selection. The Super Liquor Outlet had extremely high prices and the selection was mediocre at best. The staff was friendly, but I'd much rather have a mediocre staff and pay $20 for a handle of Bacardi Select than have a knowledgeable staff and pay $30. $30 was exactly what a handle of Bacardi Select cost at the Super Liquor Outlet. You could save $5 by walking down to the ABC Store in the same complex or you could save $10 by heading over to one of the Lee's Discount Liquor stores in the area.Selection was similarly poor. Overall, it was a small store with a small selection and high prices. Definitely not recommended.
5	BEST LIQUOR STORE EVER!Ok.  Maybe it was the mood I was in that night.  We had just had dinner and were heading to a concert.  We decided to stop by Super Liquor (lushhhhhhhhhh  haha).The prices were reasonable, I guess (I'm not a frequent purchaser of alcohol) the staff was extremely friendly AND they gave us free cups and ice so that we wouldn't have to be ghetto and swig straight from the bottle (it was just me and my boyfriend... valentine's day date night haha)
