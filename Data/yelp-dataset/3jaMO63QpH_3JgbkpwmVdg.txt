3	On a Sunday afternoon, when all the shops are closed (as is the local custom), there were only two cafes open in the center of town. One along the main street that focused more on food, and Moccasin, a modern coffee house by the covered bridge along the Alb River that flows through town.This place drew me in. It is spacious and light and the coffee drinks were fine. It would be a nicer destination in the summer when you could sit outside and take in the view. During the winter is was a good place to get a hot drink to warm my hands while I strolled through the quiet town.
