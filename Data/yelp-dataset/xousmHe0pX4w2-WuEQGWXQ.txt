4	Ask for Teresa she shows what u need even if u don't...  Lol I was pretty specific about what I wanted, and her version was better than I wanted!  She called it "Hong Kong" hairstyle!  HAHAHAHAHA
1	I wish yelp had 0 star rating ..because this eyebrow threading place deserves 0 star. 2 sisters run the place with 0 customer service skills. Today I walked in there one of the sisters was doing eyebrows.no greeting when u walk in. Once she started doing my eyebrows it was painful (I have been getting threading for 4+ years).I asked if she could use baby powder because that always seems to help with the pain. She said "I don't put powder on my customers" " I don't see good". I told her I always have get powder if it hurts so much..she said "no..you know u came in at my closing time anyway' and told me to leave and walked away. I was shocked! So she had me leave with half started one eye brow. Seriously DON'T go!
1	DO NOT COME NEAR THIS PLACE!!!I would also give this place a 0 star rating if I could . I was away on business for a month  and had to get my eyebrows done by some one else (yes they grow super fast). When I came back sisters who run the place were mad at me! First time I went to their salon after they told me that they are tired and I can't wait in line  and told me to come back the next day. I thought it was reasonable so I came in a week after while rashin told me my eyebrows are too hard for her to do so I should just go somewhere else.  You can't screen clients like that !!! I can't tell you how humiliated I felt to get kicked out of their salon like that.
