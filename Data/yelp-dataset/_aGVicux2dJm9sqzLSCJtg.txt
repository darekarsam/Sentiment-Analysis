1	Yuck I have avoided this Subway like the plague. It's too bad that this location is the most conveniently on the way to my job.  I literally walk past this Subway 5 times a week.  Even at 1:15pm it's never packed there for lunch and the reason why is  because their sandwiches stink. When I say gross I mean that the standards for food are as low as the standards for cleaning. The attitude of the workers here is just pitiful. The don't care about making a good sandwich nor do they care about keeping the place clean. What a wreck. As some one who eats at Subway 3 times a week I feel entitled to my opinion, avoid this subway.
5	I love this subway! The food is always made just the way I want it and the staff has always been very nice and efficient. They will always have my business!
4	A good Subway.  The service here is fantastic, and don't let the long lines deter you.  The lines move quickly.  Tastes like any other Subway (and I've been to a bunch).  You can get in and out quickly at any time of the day.  I go here often for lunch, and have never had a bad experience.
