5	These guys rock!Every time I submit the service request these guys show up AT THE SAME TIME of my home inspection saving me time from having to show up to do TWO inspections.On my last deal, the stupid underwriter waited till one day before close and informed the buyer they needed a clear Termite report.This meant the termite man had to come back out and do a re-inspection after repairs were done.My buyer called and got them to show up early to give him a clear report so they could close on time.I would not use anyone else to do an inspection for my deals
5	I used them twice for two rentals I own, They came out the next day to inspect and treated the entire home the following day.  Could not be more pleased with the service and warranty.  Prices were incredibly reasonable, one company gave me an estimate $300 over their rate. Highly recommend to anyone.
1	480termites to conduct termites inspection on a transaction I had in escrow,  they came back saying  property also had bed bugs, we hired them to treat for bed bugs, they treated a  total of 6 times, after nearly spending $1000, we decided to hire Burns to do heat treatment for the bed bugs, which 480termites don't offer, probably due to lack of experience, we were told immediately by Burns that we didn't have bed bugs and the dead bugs were just dog dog fleas! After spending all the money on the wrong treatment and loosing 2 buyers, I called 480termites to let them know I get the manger who didn't care and didn't wanna hear it and hands the phone back to receptionist!
