5	Was referred to Dr. tan by a friend. I wanted to get a second opinion on a procedure my current dentist recommended after spending approximately 2 minutes with me. I was able to get in with Dr. Tan the next day. His office and staff are very welcoming. Dr. Tan listened to me about the problem I was having, took an X-ray and performed a thorough     exam.  He explained in detail the problem with the tooth and the options available. He spent more time with me in one visit than my former dentist has spent with me in 3 years. I have definitely found my new dentist. His prices are reasonable too, since I don't have dental insurance.
5	Dr.Tan is my go to guy. He is so knowledgeable, professional and above all very compassionate to me and my family. Even though he knows that I only usually see him because I I'm already having a major crisis Dr. Tan as always bails me out. I love this guy!
5	I have going and seeing Dr. Tan for many years. His awesome, and every time I visit there is no wait and staff is wonderful.. that's why I am coming back for the past 5 years
