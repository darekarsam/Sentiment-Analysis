3	I'm not on this side of town very often but I was craving a pizza and very happy to see something other domino's or pizza hut or papa john's. I really am a big fan of Hungry Howies.Just can't put my finger on what it was about this location. The pizza was okay (pepperoni with garlic crust). And they really seem to know their regulars. All in all, the pie did what I needed it to do. I'll be back I'm sure.
4	I have ordered from the location at least 3 times. The staff is friendly, the pizza is fresh & hot and the salads are piled with all the right stuff. They always get my order correct, including light sauce. It's affordable and fast. I usually prefer them over, Pizza Hut & Dominos.
2	Went time hungry howies because i was craving their garlic crust pizza. Got home and my pizza had regular crust! So pissed. Would've went somewhere else with better pizza in general if I wanted regular crust. Also, the guy who took my call rang us up for the wrong price. Got there and the other guy noticed and took 5$ off. I dont like a lot of sauce, but my pizza literally tasted like there wasnt any sauce on it at all. My boyfriend asked for extra sauce on his pizza and he said it didnt seem like they put any extra on. Never had a pizza messed up anywhere before last night. I hope they figure this out because I like hungry howies.
