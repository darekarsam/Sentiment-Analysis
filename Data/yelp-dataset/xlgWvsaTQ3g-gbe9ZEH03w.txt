5	Stage Dreams is a wonderful theater program for kids of all ages and experience.  My daughter has participated in the shows as well as the summer camp.  The shows are wonderful for the kids performing and the audience. Definitely a great program and can't wait for the next show.
5	This was my daughter's first performance on stage and it was a wonderful introduction into the world of musicals! From auditions to performances, Ms. Becky and her crew were always fun, upbeat, organized and professional. It was chaotic at times, and lesser women (like I) would have crumbled, but Becky kept going, with a great attitude and a smile! We were provided a script, a t-shirt, and all of our costume pieces (except for ballet shoes and flesh-colored tights/leotard, which we were responsible for buying). Definitely felt like we got our money's worth. Love the nearby location. Always felt safe leaving my 7-year-old in their care for 2-hour practices. She had a great time and we are signing up for the next one!!
5	My daughter, now 10, has been in three regular-season productions and multiple summer productions with Stage Dreams. I can't say enough good things about Becky, Ashley, and Nicki. They definitely provide a learning environment where kids of all experience levels (including none!) are made to feel comfortable and enjoy the process as well as the performance. I don't know how they consistently maintain their patience and positive spirit with so many kids to manage--it's truly remarkable and amazes me every session. My daughter has made friends in the program and has learned some valuable lessons along the way (related to performing and otherwise). She absolutely loves this company and we love seeing her grow as a performer and as a person. I highly, highly recommend Stage Dreams for kids of all ages!
5	Becky is incredibly talented with a true gift for working with children.  I have seen her work her magic several times and would highly recommend this program.
