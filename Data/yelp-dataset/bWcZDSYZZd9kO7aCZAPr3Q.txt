2	Not a great cafe for an art museum. I expected more but alas coffee was what I wanted and coffee is what I got. The guy working behind the counter didn't seem too enthusiastic about his job. Thankfully, the selection of food and drinks certainly made up for this. There isn't much else to say but if you're in the North Side of Pittsburgh, this may serve as one of the few coffee shops around.
