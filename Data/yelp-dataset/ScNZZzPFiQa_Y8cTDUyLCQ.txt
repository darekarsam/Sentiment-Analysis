2	Panda Express isn't bad if you want quick and easy Chinese food.  The selection isn't bad and the price is pretty good.  I went here last night on my way home from work and they took BBQ Pork off their menu.  :(  I would have given them an extra star if BBQ Pork was still here.Oh yeah, and there is one more thing I have to say about this place:  FIRST!
4	The service here was excellent!  I was given very full portions and the service was very fast and friendly.  The food was pretty good and the price was reasonable.  Ofelia helped me and was very helpful and accomodating and fixed any issues that I had immediately.
5	Very fast service, food was the same as all the other Pandas but the employees made the difference
3	I picked the wrong time and day to come today I been in line for about 30 min now ugh
1	Dirty, food was old, no help, everything had to been made and the place was near empty @ around 9:30pm...Bathrooms were filthy, trash cans overflowing...Last time I'll be going to Panda Express...
4	I love that they have fresh veggies, the green beans are my favorite. I tried the Honey Sesame Chicken, it's very good but unfortunately only available for a limited time. Besides that I usually just go for the orange chicken and fried shrimp. And a few locations have added a drive thru to it which is great.
