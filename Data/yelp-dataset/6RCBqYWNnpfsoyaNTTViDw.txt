5	LOVE the work and the people.... Willy has done great work on me many times.  I  definitely be returning and would recommend to anybody.
5	I will not get tattoos anywhere else! They are a bit goofy, but I think that's why I always feel so relaxed and comfortable there. I have had several hours of work done here and I am always completely satisfied. Love Radatat!
5	I was very pleased with my tattoo.   I have an arm band from about 15 years ago.  I'd been tossing around the idea of having some color added for a few years.   On a whim I stopped by last week and made an appt.  Didn't have any time to research specifically what I wanted (ill advised I know).  Willie gave his recommendation on the fly.   It turned out much better then what I had in mind.   Well worth the money.   Again I'm very happy with the outcome.
5	I went about a month ago to get my medusa piercing and had a GREAT experience. Friendly staff. Clean shop. Will definitely go back or recommend a friend! Thank you for a safe n great experience
