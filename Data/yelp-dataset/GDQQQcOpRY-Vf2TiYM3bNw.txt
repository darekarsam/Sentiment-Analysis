5	Great place to have you hair done   If your are currently looking for a new place or or thinking of making a change of hair stylist this is the place ! No need to look any further. Try them what can it hurt?
5	This is the first time I've shown a picture and left with my hair looking exactly like it! Definitely sticking with Athena. And her prices are great!
5	I had the WORST hair cut of my life a week before I found Athena and Athena fixed it!  Ok, she did the best she could with the mess it was but, she's awesomely good.  I've only been in this area for 1 1/2 years and I've gone through 5 hairdressers.  I believe I've finally found the one!  Very happy and will be going back and reccomend her to anyone looking for a change. Thanks Athena!
