1	Worst customer service ever!! I have been waiting all day for someone to come to my house from 2-4 and no one showed up so I called and they said oh sorry we have been busy! Excuse me you couldn't of even called me and told me that you weren't coming?!? Not happy with them at all and if I would of read the other reviews before hand I wouldn't of picked them anyways this place SUCKS!!!!!
1	This is one of the worst companies I've ever dealt with. I called them on a Sunday for a leak that we had from a line in the attic at our rental property. They called me back and smoothly said Sure, no problem, we'll be there first thing tomorrow morning. The tech called me at 7:44am the next morning, and began badgering me about how bad of a problem it was, it's all the tenants fault for not changing the filter, etc. and ranting about how it will cost me $800 to fix the coil in the attic, it needs an acid wash, etc. I arrived there 20 minutes later, took a look at the filters (they weren't even that dirty), and based on that and his abuse, said no thanks, I'm not going to do it. He started to challenge me on paying for the service call, and when I said sorry, you'll have to bill me for it, he looked defeated and walked out the door. I called another company (one I've dealt with before), and they fixed it for $195. DON'T get suckered into using these guys, they were bullies, and pretty dishonest. I'll never use them again.
5	These guys rock!  Seriously, I am thrilled with their professionalism and service.  They were so easy to work with, and I was scheduled the same day!  Clay took very good care of me, and were NOT salesy (like most of these companies) I have already recommended them to friends.
