4	Pigs..Pigs...and more Pigs...I love Les Cochons Tout Ronds which is located inside Marche Jean-Talon.Free samples on top of the counter always appreciate.. I silently tried out quite a few of the cured meat they offers.Proscuitto, dry curd sausage, coppa, lonzo, terrine and much more.Great to pick up some for a picnic in the park or just to snack on.minimum of 100 g, with pate starting at around $2.We ended up getting Lonzo and Pate for our little feast back in the hotel!
