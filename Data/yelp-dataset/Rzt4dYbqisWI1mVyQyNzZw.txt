5	Our family is always well taken care of & treated like family when we go into Whiting Dental. I actually like the dentist now! And my kids love going to the dentist, too, which is a miracle.
5	Dr. Whiting is by far the best dentist I have ever seen. I went to a dentist that was closer to my home and the dentist was not able to do a satisfactory job installing my new crown. After about a year the crown fell out. Dr. Whiting and his team were able to make me a new crown and it has been perfect. My wife referred me to him saying he was the best and I am glad I went. We like him so much we switched our kids to him as well.
