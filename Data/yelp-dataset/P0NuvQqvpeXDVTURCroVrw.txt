4	My friend and I got a manicure and pedicure for $35 per person. It already cost $25 for only a manicure, so we decided that we might as well get a pedicure too. It was definitely worth it. Nancy worked on my friend and Alex worked on my fingers and toes. Service: Both were professional and limited the small talk. And when there was small talk, the topics were amusing because they were so stereotyped. Alex asked me if I liked kimchi (because I'm Korean) and whether or not I eat dog (because I'm Korean). Haha!  I thought Alex did a great job with my heels. There was so much dead skin there that he had to bring out The Grater. Now my feet feel softer and look more womanly. I also liked the fact that he was very meticulous with trimming the skin around my nails.The facilities: Clean, looks like the typical Vietnamese run nail parlor, and they offer OPI brand of nail polish (according to my friend, OPI is a solid brand). Brownie points for maintenance: after the pedicure, they clean the machine within 15 minutes!We walked in at 2PM but there were no seats so we had to make reservations for 4PM. They do take walk-ins but reservations are highly recommended. We were there for about 1 hour and 45 minutes. I thought I'd be in and out in a hour, so we were a bit surprised how we didn't even notice the time pass. Overall, I really liked the experience and I'd go back because of the convenient location and good service.
1	i don't know how well they do nails but DO NOT get a wax! I went in for an eyebrow wax and came out with a good portion of my skin ripped off! My eyebrows look good but the scab underneath them? not so much...
5	This place is the best! Christine always takes good care of me. They provide great service and great prices. The staff is super nice!
