4	Mecnhie's is a great spot for frozen yogurt and sorbet. Checkout my review of the West Island location here: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/menchies-dollard-des-ormeaux#hrid:opYRfYESSyW9UZ3kzckY8w
5	Wow I'm hooked!I've heard so much about Menchie's ever since it was on the news over a spoon issue with the language police... I'm a big fan of frozen yogourt and have been loyal to Yeh but after having discovered Menchie's I just wish there were more of 'em, downtown please! For those who say it looks like Yeh, well Menchie's has been around longer so I'm pretty sure everyone else was feeling inspired.This froyo franchise is the real deal. They have something that other chains don't, which is brand recognition: an adorable swirly head mascot, collectible spoons, a real loyalty program (you can register card online, get free gifts on your birthday, a discount after roughly every 50$ spent) etc . They even have your favorite froyo flavored lip balm, how cool is that!It's a bright, cheerful atmosphere with extremely helpful and friendly staff. They are extremely kid friendly, they even have a little room for you to book birthday parties in. Right as you walk in, you notice little taste tester cups for you to sample the flavors - everything is delicious, so it's a hard choice. Lots of toppings, an assortment of candy and fruits although probably more candy  to fresh fruits ratio. Many different syrups like chocolate, caramel, strawberry, honey. There's something for everyone.I highly recommend Menchie's, it's more than just a treat, it felt like a unique experience.
3	Menchie's is a great frozen yogurt place. I liked most of their flavors, but what really caught my eye was their toppings. I found that their toppings were a lot more varied than their flavors. I think that they could improve their place by getting at least a few more flavors of yogurt.
