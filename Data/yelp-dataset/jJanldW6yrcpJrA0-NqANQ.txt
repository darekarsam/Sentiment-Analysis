3	Overpriced but pretty decent. Mazerattis parked out front when I was there... you can see where this is going.
3	It's a bit overpriced, but it has a nice neighborhood-y feel with vintage Westmount pictures on the wall. Sometimes I just want to hit up a place and get a sandwich, and this is in my neighborhood.For whatever reason, the servers don't really appear to be into refilling drinks, which has happened almost every time I've gone. This isn't enough to keep me from going back, though--I sort of feel bad rating this 3 stars, but the description "A-OK" is pretty spot-on for this place.
3	I stopped by this restaurant the last time I was in Montreal for a quick lunch. The sandwich I got was good and it wasn't too expensive. Definitely a place I will go again when I'm not looking to spend to much, or it's a Sunday and everything else is closed.
1	This place is garbage. It is not only over priced, but they use cheap, low quality ingredients. Canned food is never acceptable for me when I dine out. I had the tuna melt sandwich and it was $15 without a drink!
2	Although it's well located, it definitely lacks in quality.Food : it's okay, I mean nothing tastes bad per say, but it's all stuff that you make at home when you're in a rush between your sons karate class and daughters ballet lesson.Decor : simple, but true to what it has always been since opening decades ago. Nice.Service : very good. The staff is very friendly and checks on you regularly. A+This is a place to go when you're in a hurry.
