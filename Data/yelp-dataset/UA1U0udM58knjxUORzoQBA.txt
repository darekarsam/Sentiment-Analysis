5	Dana is absolutley amazing! She takes her time and the ending look is always just what I want :)
5	Great Salon! I went there for higlights and a hair cut with Rose, she was excellent. Probably one of the best hair cuts and highlights i have had in a long time.
5	I have always loved this salon but ever since the new owner took over recently I LOVE it even MORE! The new online website makes it so easy to get information, learn about stylists, and so much more! The atmosphere is perfect for relaxing while getting pampered! The staff is knowledgeable and always has a smile on their faces which make it a pleasant and rewarding experience. I would highly recommend this salon to anyone!!
5	Really enjoy coming to this salon. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. I go to Dana to get my hair done NEVER disappointed and the head massage is awesome! Highly recommend
5	Pad a cut my hair and did balayage highlights and my hair looks amazing!! I highly recommend her as she is a natural and very professional!
5	I've been to numerous salons throughout the country paid exuberant amounts of money for a quality scissor cut. I've stuck mainly with one big name company for the last 4 years (Aveda) but D'Amantes has surpassed them by far. Becky is the best, I feel like I'm stealing from them every time I get my hair cut there, quality like this is hard to come by.
5	Randomly found this salon here on yelp and I'm glad I gave it a try! I got my hair colored, cut and styled by Jennifer! Not only was she extremely nice, but she turned my dry damaged her into fabulous silky hair!! I will definitely be returning!!
