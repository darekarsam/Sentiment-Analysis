5	I just moved from Chicago and had to start over with my dental care and just chose a clinic close to my home but was totally surprised at the ease in which this was done.  The office staff and assistants are so great to deal with and Dr. Patel, could not have made things easier for me.  He was direct and to the point and by suggesting certain creative ways to handle my problem he actually saved me money.  His clinic is new and he is a professional in all ways .  I will continue to use him as my dentist.  Very friendly as well.
5	Totally love this place, have been coming here for years as I live right down the block. I think Dr. Patel realizes the importance of taking a thorough approach to one's smile. Not just for the visual effect, but for overall good health. I'd been staving off gum disease, but since coming here, I haven't really had a problem. I just needed a bit more attention to get my gums to the next level!
