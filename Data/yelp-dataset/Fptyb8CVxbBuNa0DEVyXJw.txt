4	its ever so wrong but i love cinnabon! yum yum yum
3	I love cinnabon. This one is an ok one.  Mostly everything gets baked fresh about every half hour. The service is ok and the workers aren't to friendly but I don't care I just want the cinnabon.
5	First stop when in Vegas? Cinnabon because we're hungry fresh off this road trip. Next we'll go to Luxor and before we leave we're back here again along with Fat Tuesdays... this goes good with Fat Tuesdays.
