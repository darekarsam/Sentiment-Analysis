5	Great place, modern hip look and a great bar with friendly service. All around a great casual restaurant for dinner to please everyone.
4	Been going to Rotisseries Saint-Hubert since I was in grade 3. Over the years their menu has evolved and, while the focus is still on chicken, they have great salads, ribs and steaks as well. The Cote-des-Neiges restaurant is my father and I's go to location as it is close to his appartment. Our server was Maryse, a lovely and very efficient young woman who was very focused on detail. I had the table d'hote which, for 17 dollars brought me a caesar salad, a leg chicken quarter, rice and cole slaw, as well dessert (I opted for the huge portion of pouding chomeur with ice cream) and a coffee.  My father ordered 2 chicken fillets with  vegetables and cole slaw. My caesar salad had real bacon which, for a chain restaurant, deserves praise. Chicken is always great: crunchy tasty skin, moist and tender flesh. Great rice and that coleslaw (traditional,oil based, I am not a fan of the creamy one) I could eat buckets of every day.I also had a Bombay Sapphire gin and tonic which brought the total bill to about 47 dollars which is good. Needless to say, Maryse's service deserved a great tip.By the way, chomeur means unemployed in French. Now I know why they call it pouding chomeur. This dessert (which consists of vanilla cake, cream sugar hot sauce and vanilla ice cream) is such a sweet, sugary, filling huge portion that, when one has finished it,one really does not feel like going back to work....Bon Appetit!
