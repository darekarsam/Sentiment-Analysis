3	It was a bit of a mixed bag from Zebra, on my recent visit. They've taken the smart decision to source their soups and salads from Union of Genius, so they can be relied upon to be excellent, at all times. Sadly, their sandwiches weren't up to much, and Lavazza isn't a coffee favourite, with me, so there's definitely room for improvement.So overall, we said: "I thought Zebra was rather smart, and has made a very wise choice in their soup stockist. They have some work to do to improve the sandwiches, though, but there's every reason to think that can be achieved. I look forward to popping in again, soon, to check on progress."

Cute bookshelf wallpaper :)  Just noticed a few days ago that they're open until around 10pm during the festival, so I'll be going back soon.Plus they have free wifi :)The only downside is that it's a pretty small place - maybe seats around 10-15 people max.  But if you're looking to grab something and go, then it's in a great location just off the royal mile.
