3	I've somehow always known Deli Italia was always there but somehow failed to acknowledge its existence. I've walked past a million times but never really taken it on board. It's a bit like ghosts in the film the sixth sense....Anyway my yelp senses finally forced me to accept Deli Italia's existence and give it a shot.Delia Italia offers Mediterranean style meals as well as a selection of sandwiches, baguettes, snacks etc. I love Italian food (in small doses) so this deli really is my cup of tea. Unfortunately compared to the many other deli and sandwich shops nearby, Deli Italia can be a bit pricey for what you get. Though the quality is not bad by any means. When I first went in I tried one of their wee pasta dishes they serve which was pretty tasty, but again not as filling as the jam packed (sometimes literally) sandwiches I could get from down the road.Not a bad deli and worth trying if you're lunching in the area. I may just need to pop in again and try some more.
