2	I've banked with Bank of America for about 20 years now. For the most part I've been happy; no real complaints. So a couple of days ago, my new ATM/Visa bankcard arrives in the mail with the usual sticker plastered across the card reminding me to call and activate it. So, I call the phone number, key in my account number and a few other things and before the automated system tells me the card is activated, it goes in to a sales pitch for credit monitoring. Finally it tells me to press 2 if i am not interested, which I promptly do. Then the automated system assumes that I made a mistake and proceeds to tell me what a great deal I am passing up and the the world will stop turning if I don't take this deal. I hang up. Hopefully my ATM card now works. If not... I'll be calling Wells Fargo. Stop pedaling crap when people call to activate their credit/ATM cards!
1	If I could give -5 stars I would.This is the worst, least customer service oriented corporation I have ever worked with in my life. E-V-E-R!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A rundown:Started an account and wanted a higher interest rate so I chose a Market rate SAVINGS account. The bank manager set me up with over-draft protection and I went home happy.Got an over-draft fee. WTF.Called the customer service number. Was told that my bank account was not eligible for over-draft protection because it was actually a checking account called a Market Rate SAVINGS account. The fees stood. WTF.Received a notice in the mail (from BOA I thought) saying that there had been a lawsuit for over-draft fees. Called the customer service number again. Spoke with an agent who cheerfully remarked "oh, that's silly that your account isn't set up for over-draft protection. Let me take care of that" and refunded me the fees.Got an over-draft charge. WTF.Called and explained that I had been told by a rep that my account was eligible for over-draft protection. Was accused of lying because the system said that the fees had been refunded based on a "courtesy" as opposed to a "bank error", talked through the most laughable investigative process and told that the fees stood - there was nothing I could do to change it. WTF.About 5 WTFs and several hours on the phone in, I realize that every transaction that is not a WTF transaction has been an error. I now see that Bank of America is the kind of financial institution that will find any manner of unethical ways to profit from the little folks so they can bask in their spoils from the sweeping veranda of their Italianate mansion in Saint Tropez, cognac in hand...or at least fund the exploitation of 3rd world countries the world over. Despicable.
1	With all the stress in my life, I could really use a bank that gives some sort of thought to something...anything at all.  However.....**Boring story**I put in an online request for a transfer last week, and a couple days later I got an email saying that the transfer had been initiated.  The days since the request have been the busiest I've ever experienced, leaving little time to think about sleep, much less think about my money.  Today, I needed to get a cashier's check, but when I went to the bank, I found that the transfer never went through.  So, I spent 20 minutes on hold with customer service while they tried to figure out why it had been canceled.**End boring story**Okay anyway.  The gist is that the transfer didn't go through, but they never let me know that they had canceled it.Dudes.  If my shit doesn't go through, fucking tell me my shit didn't go through!  How hard is it to set up automatically generated emails to let people know stuff?  If the universe weren't looking out for me, this could have spelled disaster for my new living situation...and made my already tearfully stressful life, well, disastrous.In addition to all this, they have different systems for California, Washington, and the rest of the country, which makes my banking life even more complicated because my account was opened in Virginia, I live in California, and spend a lot of time in Seattle (woo!).  Dear B of A, your cheap lollipops don't make up for your thoughtlessness and stressfulness and complication-inducing awfulness.  You better fucking be glad I got some sleep last night and I'm in a good mood.
3	don't know if these other posters walk around w/a black cloud around them, or if they've checked out other banks lately, but for all its faults, BOFA is still heads and shoulders above what we have to choose from around here, on a day to day, year to year basis (and before i get flamed for this, i worked for Wells Fargo/Walkoverya, and have been in the bank biz for a # of yrs (none w/BOFA)   )..they're not perfect, god knows, but they do get it right 90%+ of the time and offer a ton of perks/services that you don't get or pay for elsewhere...BELIEVE me as someone who has dealt w/other places and have kept my stiff w/BOFA, they do a pretty good job most of the time.....file these nitpicky complaints under SHIT HAPPENS, nuthin is perfect (hey guy who had to activate his ATM...this would happen to you anywhere u go and also on regular credit card type cards....its not the end of the world)...if these complaints are all u have to bitch about, you live a pretty sweet, stress-free life.....
1	Stay tuned....
5	Great facilities! Bank of America occupies much of downtown Charlotte and they have done an amazing job of making the area great. The building is very secure, Retina scanners, plenty of security. Very clean. Lot's of food choices, bars, safe area to walk around!
