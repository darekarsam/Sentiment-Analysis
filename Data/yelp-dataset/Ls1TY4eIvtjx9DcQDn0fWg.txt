5	"WOOF'S", formerly the King Club,  has been transformed into one of the  newest, friendliest, cleanest gay (and straight friendly) sports bars in downtown Madison.  Hot, friendly bartenders, great nightly specials, FREE popcorn, Killer pool table with white felt, dart boards and back lounge area, Thumping House DJ on Saturday Nights and weekly specials make this a MUST stop while downtown or just to watch Badger, Packer or other games on one of their 5 TV'S with friends-gay or straight!
3	I'm not the target audience of a gay bar, but I was completely fine with Woof's.  I was a little disappointed with the size of this place.  It was a club equivalent of a fun sized Snickers.  Woof's is a sports bar targeted towards Madison's gays, but it wasn't all that sporty besides for a pool table that had to be covered and darts that I wished people would stop playing.  Insane Dancing + Darts being thrown across the dance floor = Asking for trouble.The most annoying thing about Woof's was the air conditioning.  It was hot outside earlier so at first it was nice, but the place wasn't that crowded and I was too tired to get my dance on (I had driven up earlier that day from DC) so perhaps it was nice, but for me it was just a little too fake cold.  All in all Woof's is a great place to go and dance, but don't go expecting to find too many people.  We definitely brought the party.
4	I had nice gal pal hangout over $1.75 rails during the happy hour. The happy hour definitely makes you happy at this friendly place while keeping your bank account healthy. Like the previous reviewer, I'm not the target clientele, but my friend and I felt very comfortable there. Stick pretzels served in pet dishes adds a nice touch.
3	Ridiculous.
5	Once in a while I'll go here with some of my male friends who also happen to be gay and I have always felt welcomed.  I appreciate that!  Plus the drinks are affordable and there is no cover charge, can't go wrong with that!
