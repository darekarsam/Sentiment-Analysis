3	If you are looking for something to do, take a break from walking the strip, or take a break from gambling, come watch a movie here!  The theater is really old, a little difficult to locate, not visible from the strip (on the side of Denny's), and the theaters are super small, but hey it gives you something to do other than the usual things in Vegas.  Prices are movies are definitely a bit pricey.  Staff at the front seem to be friendly.  Not much more to say about a movie theater.  :)  Enjoy.
2	Decided to take a break from walking around the strip and found a movie theatre so we went to go check it out. First of all the theatre is hidden so it's kind of sketchy and secondly the theatre isn't as nice as other ones. The seats were so uncomfortable it was hurting my back so me and my bf left the theatre and got our money back and I would not recommend this place to anyone unless your okay with horrible seats and a sketchy theatre.
3	Really bad seats, low and uncomfortable.The projector is of high quality, so it's a good place to catch a movie on the strip. Concession stand is expensive but OK.
