5	Dr. Wolff and his team, Gretchen Post PA-C and Lindsay Baumhefner PA-C, are God's saving grace. My back pain had become increasingly debilitating over the past year and I came to Dr Wolff after having terrible treatment at AZ Pain Specialists. Dr. Wolff looked me in the eye, expressed his desire to relieve my pain, and made a comprehensive treatment plan with my input on my first visit. It was shortly after that, various non-invasive procedures were done to pin point the cause of my pain and then we treated. I am still recovering from my last procedure but am so grateful to Dr Wolff and his team, that I wanted  to tell EVERYONE about them. If you have back pain, it can be all consuming and depressing. Dr. Wolff wants to make you feel better! Don't hesitate to see the wonderful doctors here, they will change your life.
1	I wish I could write a good review but after being asked to get an MRI, which I sent over to the clinic, I got a message from Dr Wolf saying he wanted to speak with me. I called and called and called. I never got a return call so in frustration decided, if this is the way I'm being treated before I pay for services how will it be after I give them my money. I decided it wasn't worth the risk as I would be traveling from out of town to see Dr Wolf. All I can say is I've never been treated like this before and subsequently asked for my MRI back and pursued other options. They obviously didn't care about getting a new patient. All in all a very frustrating experience.
