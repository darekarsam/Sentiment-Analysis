1	Worst game stop I have ever been too. I use to go the Gamestop on Decatur and Sahara one of the bet ones in town but they close down I don't why that's beside the fact this store has people that do not now anything promos. I bought a game bf4 for 360 because they told me that I was going to get a code for get a code for the Xbox one version but that was a lie the promo, ended the day before and they told code should be in the box and it wasn't so I return the game the same day because what's the point for the game I rather wait the two months for to get The Xbox one version I go back to the store I wanted my money back but they said I could I open the box I was I open the box because you told me !!!! ok I was like let me have store credit for the full price and they were like no because you open the box and we can't do that. I have been buying from GameStop for years since ps2 this has to be the worst experience I have ever gotten. I was lie to and given the wrong information.  It always feels dirty there I don't know why .....
5	Been here several times, every single time is a good experience. Today, I got help with a game I got for the wrong platform, they switched it out with no problems. Made for a very nice, short, and hassle free experience.
4	Always get welcomed when coming in , friendly staff and very helpful, I always go to them when I have videogame questions or issues and they have always find a way to help.
