5	How fun!  My mom and I ended up having a personal lesson. Tjay made us feel right at home. We laughed, drank wine, and managed to create some pretty cool art in the meantime. I'll definitely be going back.
5	Such a fun little place! Drink wine and paint!? Why not?? This place definitely exceeded my expectations! I'm a beginner at painting and our instructor T Jay was so helpful and fun! Will definitely come back again! Highly recommended for everyone to try!
5	Six fun loving girls wanted an adventure.  All first timers.  Fantastic idea for a girlfriends gathering and/or a birthday party. Shernell, the owner, accomodated our needs.  She went out of her way to make sure the party went well.  The artist, Eli, was fun, helpful, professional, and became our new friend.  Several of us lacked artist ability yet Eli magically turned us into artists.  We drank wine, painted, laughed a lot, danced, sang, ate, and had a blast.  I highly recommend Painting with A Twist in Tempe.  We will be back!
5	First time being here and it was a blast!!!! Great customer service!!!!!!! I absolutely am a fan of this place. Will definitely come back soon and I'll bring more wine (:This is such a perfect place to enjoy with friends. Good vibes
5	We were looking for something different to do tonight and boy did we find it! What a fantastic time!! We got there early so were able to meet the staff & right off started to have a blast! TJ was so helpful and very entertaining! We were able to change up colors and be creative while still following good instruction!I appreciate that you bring your own food and drink and not stuck paying for overpriced stuff.Can't wait to go again!
5	Yesterday I went to painting with a twist with a large group of girls. NONE of us are very artsy but we wanted to try something different. It was amazing!!! Kevin and Jeff were our instructors and they were hilarious. The whole night was so much fun and I would recommend it as a night out for anyone!!!
