5	Awesome place, great people!!! They make their juice in house so you know what you are getting.
5	Best juice flavors in town. No aftertaste. I was so excited after trying a few of them that I was being very loud and happy. That's how good they are. Owners are very sweet people. The store is very stylish and clean. They know what they're doing when it comes to builds and hardware. They make all of their juices and make sure that they only use the best ingredients. Just a wonderful place. I think this store and their sister company, Vegas Vapor Emporium will be my main places to go.
5	Very happy to have found this store. Talked with Tim, and found him very willing to answer my questions about dripping. Also glad to find a very well set up and we'll stocked shop.
1	Went into this shop by direction of the owner of another shop and I have to say it was the worst. I had brought up another shop owner and the owner of Seven Vapor just talked shit about him. Word of advice don't talk shit to customers about the guy that without him you wouldn't have a shop. I went there once and will never go back.
