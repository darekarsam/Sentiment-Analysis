5	I had my 2008 Infiniti G35 detailed by Olindo at DoubleTake.  The whole process could not have been better.  I made my appointment and he was able to pick my car up in the morning and he ended up dropping my car off at the end of the day. My car was a mess before and not it looks great!
5	Had my FJ Cruiser detailed the other day. It looks great. Everything looks great. Guys there are nice and accommodating.
1	I used their recent Groupon for what they called a "mini detail." This mini it's me $140 total, and it was far less detailed than it should be, because right away I could see places where they hadn't touched. They claim to have called me about the up charge, which was a lie. I guess they forgot that cell phones keep track of incoming calls. When I reviewed them through groupon I was fair, and did not call them out on their lie. They shot back that "it was a Mini Detail, you should READ before you buy." I know what I bought. $140 for rude customer service. That's what I bought!I will not recommend them to anyone
5	The owner is a really nice guy and a fantastic tint tech. Prices are fare and service is excellent! Will be back soon for a detail.
