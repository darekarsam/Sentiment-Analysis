4	Every meal is $5 only, so everyone buys two! They are good sized meals to where one would be enough bit two makes sure and why not for the price. The sweet potato fries are amazing and the burgers are good! The drinks are $5-$9 ea , guess thats where they make their money. Good fun atmosphere and the waiters are good. Slow to make the food but cant complain for the price. Definitely a place to try out.
1	"Woah, $5 food? Awesome!" No. It is just terrible.
4	$5 Bites. Need I Say More?Whether you're looking for somewhere to 5a7 with your coworkers, a cheap fun meal with the family, or place to swig and gnosh while you catch up with friends, consider checking out L'Entrepot.All items on the vast menu are $5, and fare spans the gamut of burgers, tacos, poutines, and just about anything else to quell your munchies. Drinks are also reasonably priced, and the service is friendly and decent.If you're going to check it out, though, I'd suggest doing with a group of friends so you can all sample as much as possible. I've only done about a third of the menu, but I haven't yet found anything on it that I didn't like.
4	Whoa whoa...$5 food? Must be cheap and not so good....NOPE wrong! I was invited by a friend while I was in the neighborhood to try this place and well, it was pretty good! I had the tacos and had some of my friend's mac and cheese with beef. Both were really tasty. I also had a beer to go with it. The place was seriously packed, for a Wednesday night. Must be a good sign. I really recommend coming here for cheap decent food and some drinks if you're in the plateau area.
