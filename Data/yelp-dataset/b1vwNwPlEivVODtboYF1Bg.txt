3	They laughed at me as I stared in.  Not really, but they weren't about to open the store either.  It had just turned 7:30 and that is the time that they close.  Oh...what to do?
2	Without a doubt the worst Starbucks in the Pittsburgh area. Roughly half the time I go here I regret it due to rude service and backups after placing your drink order.  If it were not the closest to my house I would never enter again. I have now begun to drive the extra mile to avoid this place. It is located in a small upscale mall with plenty of parking. It would be an ideal quick in and out if the service was better. Avoid during the morning hours and request no foam to avoid your drink being only a quarter full of liquid. If there is a closer option use it. Drinks are standard.
3	Parking for this location is horrible. But, the staff is excellent once you make it in to the store.
