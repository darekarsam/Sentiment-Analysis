4	Great Job! Great timing and not to mention lowest rate I found. Thanks
5	This is the second time I have used Load 4 Less and I couldn't be happier!!  I had originally set up a date and time to meet them at my storage facility to move a 10'X30' unit into our new rental home.  About 30 minutes after our agreed meet time I called and learned that I had made an error in the date and I was a day early!!!  They were great and called their driver and loader at home, woke them up and got them moving to my location.They managed to get a 26' truck loaded and then unloaded at the house on the first day and repeated it on the second day.  All the furniture and boxes were moved into the correct rooms and nothing broken or damaged.The gentlemen that were doing all the work were fun, friendly and very professional.Like I said, I have now used them twice and will use them in the future and certainly recommend them to friends and family!  The rate was the lowest around and clearly stated up front. cash only.
1	This guy is a Joke!!!! Micheal Worked for 30 min all the time on the phone. Then all of a sudden was gone!!! The dude left!!! Just left with out even a word. I called and he said his worker hurt himself and had to leave. Whatever!!! He then told me his boss made him wait for another person to help him. They never showed up...... Never called. I was left high and dry. I called back and said I wanted his bosses number.  He gave me a number to a whole other company. They didn't like that and they r looking into that. Don't use this guy. Michael is his name. Not professional at all. U get what u pay for. I have since called him over and over before writing this to see if he would want to fix this and he ignores my calls.
