3	Even at 1$ a taco, the tacos at tres pesos is pretty mediocre. The Tortillas are hard and chewy, and the meat, with perhaps the exception of the pastor is fairly bland.Our two sides though were pretty solid, the pupusa revuelta was pretty solid with a good crisp skin and the elote tamale was falvorful.
2	We went on a Friday night hoping for a quick meal. There was a six-piece Mariachi band playing in the restaurant (though didn't feel like it was the night's entertainment, maybe playing specifically for someone at the bar) and it was so loud, we decided to go for takeout. The waitress seemed rude and took a while before she took our order, and then we waited for another 15 before we got our food. The waitress was rude when we paid as well. On top of that, the food wasn't that good. The salsa tastes like vinegar, and my husband's tacos were corn and small even though he asked for flour. I had the vegetarian burrito, which was okay, but the guacamole on top tasted like dust.
1	I love mexican and thought I'd give this place a try. Horrible. The ONLY good thing was the salsa. The 'tableside' guac--obviously from a bag, and not made tableside. Dinner was no better than taco bell. Bland food, stale veggies for ingredients. Even though it was cheap, it wasn't worth 1/2 the price. Save your time, go elsewhere.
1	I visited this location last night and was disappointed to find a note on the door that they were not accepting any more GROUPONS at this time? I didn't know you had an option to accept or not accept. We were so looking forward to dining with them. I will definitely be reaching out to GROUPON today. Do not participate in a program if you ate not willing to honor it all the way through.The location on Woodlawn is awesome....too bad the coupon is only for Central Ave.
3	It's Mexican on Central - pretty good compared to a lot of other places, but not as good as others. Went with a Groupon and probably won't be back just because the service was very poor.
