4	When a friend asked me to meet up with him and some other friends for Sunday Brunch, I'm like yeah man, where? The rotation to this point included L'Avenue, Dim Sum @ Kam Fung or some small diner in the Plateau or NDG, all them waiting for at least a 45 minute wait, plus the time it takes to wait for stragglers. So I went to Yelp to check it out and first see the reviews, then the menu pics + prices. First thought was: Hold up!  This place is in Laval?! No way I'm heading out there, I don't care who's got a Communauto membership, it's just too far, I know people travel great and wide, and there is a lot of seating but can't do it mate. Then my friend texted me the address for the new one in Cote Des Neiges, near the Jewish General, I was in! The line up was about 15-20 minutes and it was packed with 20somethings, you know this is foodie paradise. On to the food, I had the Eggs Benedict Classic, I call it the litmus test for all breakie joints, it was about $12 but it was worth it, heaping hash browns, for $2 I had extra cheese on top and a huge fruit and berry bowl. I started in on it, and couldn't stop...the one caveat was that it wasn't exactly hot and when Hollandaise is warm it changes it's taste and flavour. Can't win em all and since it was new I let it pass, for now. Good eats, bright place, and lots of space, check out the new Allo Mon Coco!
