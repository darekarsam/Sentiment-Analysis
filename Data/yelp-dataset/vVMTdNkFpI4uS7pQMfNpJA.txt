3	Its a great park, always lots of activites going on. The bathroom faciliaties are not very clean, but you cant expect to much from a park.
4	This park is close to my niece's school so we visit frequently. Both my niece and nephew have their soccer and t-ball games here. The grass for the games is always kept up, so it's nice that the kids are able to play on a lush field. I like that the playground itself has an awning/cover, so when the sun is out, the equipment and the kids are in the shade. There are not a lot of picnic tables so if you are looking to have a birthday party here, make sure you come early to reserve some covered seating for your party. The park also has a basketball court and softball fields around the corner. The softball fields are nice, clean and they have an open snack bar! If you visit the park during one of the major kid's games, you can also catch the shaved ice truck in the parking lot. The atmosphere is great, it's nice and clean, good park to take the kids!
4	Nice park with canopy shade, basketball courts and a nice size field. This park has two separate playgrounds, but the one for the toddlers is tiny. Plenty of shaded seating as well.
