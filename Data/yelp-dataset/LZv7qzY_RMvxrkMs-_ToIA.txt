4	Good pizza but Hollywood Pizzeria is a little better. Al's subs on pizza dough are amazing and I go with that before the pizza.
2	The pizza sauce needs a good improvement, sauce to spicy. The subs are ok.
4	Honestly I live like 5 minutes away from this place and other restaurants and come here because the food is actually good. The subs are really good and is my most reccommended food. Poutine is the runner up to the submarine. Server is a little slow but generally it's good!
