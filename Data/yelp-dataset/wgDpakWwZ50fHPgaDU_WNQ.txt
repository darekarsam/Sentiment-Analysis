5	Great service!  Great Showroom! I love Modern and they have plenty!  Sent me to another store to find what I was looking for - That is a True Professional!!!
1	The worst supplier I have ever experienced.    We have four low voltage lighting systems from these guys.    Major problems with all.    Instead of working to help you solve the problems, they work very, very hard to blame everyone else- even after their manufacturer owned up to design problems.    They just don't have the customer satisfaction chip.   Go somewhere else.
5	I would not go anywhere else for my lighting needs. The team at LBU are as professional and helpful as can be. We have used them for 10 years as we have replaced almost every light in our older home. They have even come to the house to make recommendations. You don't get service like this anywhere else.
