2	A ship which is a bar, restaurant and music cellar. No reviews yet, shame. So all the people that I usually see on the Cruz don't seem to bother about reviews on Yelp - or are there no Yelpers going to the Cruz? Anyway this ship is a less of a hit and mostly miss for me. They have a brilliant location and a fantastic venue and why oh why don't I like it?. I want to! especially in the summer when you can have the sun (if..) on the deck the whole day. There are no comfertable chairs on the deck and it has an 'ramshackle' outdoor bar thingy.. but when the sun is out it is packed.The restaurant has not been visited anytime I passed. Can't comment on that. The inside of the Cruz is .. a ship's lounge. there is a grand Piano and all is a well kept. I can't say anymore really as most of the time for me it was a bit .. meh.
3	Well, it's a ship. Which is a novelty in itself. But you only really need to make this place a stop if you require a beer outdoors at the Shore. They have benches outside that are ideal for a quick beverage in the sunshine. I wouldn't eat here as expensive and have heard it's not very good. But for the benches and banter with pals I'd take a seat!
1	Picture says it all....ha this place is awful. To call it a dive does dives a dis-service. Probably the least appealing place I have ever been unfortunate enough to spend any time in.On a pub crawl with Owen.C to find Leiths biggest dive I feel we hit the mark here!! The funniest thing was the wedding reception going on there and a 60th birthday....!Hialrious!
4	It's a pub on a boat! How could I resist?The upper deck is a nice place to sit out on a warm day (or evening), and it's really empty in October, so it feels like you're on your own boat... if you use your imagination a bit.The interior's quite pleasant to sit in, too, and the range of beers isn't too bad.
