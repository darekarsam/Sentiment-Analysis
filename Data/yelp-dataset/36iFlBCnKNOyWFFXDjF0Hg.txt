4	Standard Taco Bell. I used to work by this one a lot. It's always clean and the employees are always nice. I really probably eat far too much of this stuff, but it's so good.
2	The employees here are all very nice and the food as a whole is what I would expect from a Taco Bell. But the burrito I had here about two months ago had such a strong patchouli taste that I have not gone back. It seriously tasted as if it had been seasoned with patchouli.
4	The good is always hot and fresh! It's convenient for me to walk across the parking lot on my lunch break to grab something to eat. The customer service is excellent as well!
2	So this is my regular Taco Bell because it is right by my place.. I have had good and bad experiences here, but the bad outweigh the good.. Tonight is one of many that my order was completely wrong.. Nothing is worse than not eating much all day and deciding to spring for Taco Bell and your food being made wrong.. I ordered a tostada and two spicy chicken tacos with no lettuce.. They all came with a ton of lettuce.. I absolutely hate lettuce and spent a lot of time picking every single piece off..to top it off my chicken tacos didn't even have the sauce that it comes with.. Not like anyone reads yelp reviews for a fast food place but needless to say I'm Disappointed:(((((
1	Customer service was great and food was good. Avoid the bathrooms! !!!!! There was feces smeared on the walls. The bathrooms were not clean in any way whatsoever.
