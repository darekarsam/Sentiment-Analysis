2	Let's face it.  Papa John's pizza is phenomenal compared to other national chains.  Their ingredients are simply better.  I order from this location and others very frequently.  The Freedom Dr. location sadly has a lack of attention to detail at times.  More than half of the time, they do not fulfill your order as requested.  For example, if you want "well done" bake or a "square cut" crust, this may be ignored.  This is particularly annoying considering I order online and the exact specifications of the pizza are printed on a label that is then applied to the box.  Lack of attention to detail.
3	I am not a huge Papa John's person. I can say though, the food from this location was not bad at all. The pizza was really good for Papa Johns and we tried the chicken bites and I really enjoyed them. If you are a Papa John's fan I don't see this location being a let down. On the flip side, I am not a Papa John's fan and this location wasn't a let down. I am sticking with three stars though due to the fact that it was still Papa John's.
5	A friend of mine was stranded because of the CLT airport fire, and while this location had on the web that they stopped delivering at 11 PM (and a nearby Pizza Hut refused to provide service, though they were listed as delivering until midnight), they said they could do it, took the order, let me pay for it (so my friend wouldn't have to), and were very accommodating. We'll see if the order comes through, but I can't fault the customer service! UPDATE: The order arrived promptly and was hot. Excellent work, PJ!
