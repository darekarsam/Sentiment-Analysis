5	Very pleasant staff. They care about the children and there understanding of the material.
5	The owner here, Hiroko, is absolutely amazing. She is very pleasant to work with and has gone above and beyond to help our kids. I've been to other centers and this center has been by far the best, most organized center with a great staff.
5	Amazing. Staff is all amazing! This place helped my 5 year old sooo much. 5 months ago she was so behind and struggled learning to read. It was so stressful for us. But now she is all caught up and reading! I highly highly recommend sending your child here!
