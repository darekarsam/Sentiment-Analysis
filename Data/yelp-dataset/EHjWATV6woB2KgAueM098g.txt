5	Great place for boba tea, smoothies, and juices. They're kind of tucked away, along the same strip as Tom's Bbq and Thai Dressing. I stumbled upon this place after filling my water containers at the water and ice in the same corner. They had an A frame on the street pointing where they were..... Since I'm a sucker for cafes of all sorts, I decided to try them out. I have been happy with everything I've gotten there. Usually will get the taro tea with boba, but have also tried a couple smoothies and juices. I heard they're gonna start making "snow" too, with different flavors and topping options. I'm excited to give that a try when they have it. To top it off I have received excellent service from this place every visit, from every employee. Absolutely 5 stars from me!
5	Great green juices the best I ever had.They serve full glass full of juice and not filled with ice.
4	This little hidden cafe was worth the trip to find it. After visiting Vampire Penguin in San Jose I've been looking for a place to find "snow" dessert. And my hubby wants a closer boba place. The menu is small with not too much variety but there's enough to make you want to try it. They have smoothies, boba, and the snow fluff I've been looking for. Plus some real food options.It's a newer place so it was quiet when we visited but it looks like a relaxing place to hang out. I see its potential. And my hubby liked their boba. Price 4/5 it's about what you expect to pay. Good potion size though. Food 3.5/5 I liked it but didn't fall in love. But I would like to try more. Overall 3.5/5 like I said, it's a newer place so it might not blow your mind but I want to see it succeed. Check it out!
