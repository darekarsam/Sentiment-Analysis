5	There is nothing fancy about this place just old fashioned haircuts just like when you were a kid. Get a haircut from Bob, people are always waiting in line for him but he is worth the wait because he is an excellent barber. He is a master of his craft and he can straight razor shave you with his eyes closed. Barbers are a a dying breed. If you ever find a good one stick with him.
5	Best barber shop I have ever been to. 4 hour drive well worth it. Highly recommended over 40 years of experience.
5	I've been going to Pecos Barber since 1996. Reasonably priced, and you still get an old fashion straight razoring around your neck and ears. Bob is great! But if you don't have time to wait for Bob, there is a guy named Rex that always gives me a great haircut as well!
