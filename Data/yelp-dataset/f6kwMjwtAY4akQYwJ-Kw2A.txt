5	I went to the T-mobile store with an issue with Google Maps crashing on my brand new G_S4 in one of the sub menus. The staff and manager were very knowledgeable and super helpful and kind. They went beyond customer service to help me and they were able to pin point the issue to a Google software bug. Thank you so much, in today's time, it is rare and really great to experience exceptional customer service.
1	Whenever we go to this location we regret it. The service we receive is subpar. One of the rudest things an employee can do is be in the middle of ringing you up and start helping another customer. This has happened twice here. This current time I just needed to pay a bill but apparently they don't know how long the wait will be...it already had been a long wait. It was so long of a wait another customer who was there before me left saying very loudly "I'm going to Verizon!" before they ever got assistance. This location makes me want too switch companies as well. The lady who appears to be the one in charge here has no idea what she is doing. I feel bad for the other workers who do attempt to help you but can't because of her. Hopefully, they get new management in there fast! I've also heard multiple workers exclaim to customers about the phone they are selling "we are all out" or "this is our last one". Really? Are you that low in stock? How is this location even still in business. Makes you wonder!
5	We stopped by this afternoon to order a new phone, switch carriers,  etc   We were served by Fabian.  He explained everything well and didn't try to sell us extras we didn't want -- very good service.
