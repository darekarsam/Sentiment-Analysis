4	I was very happy with the services provided by Scott at ifixsprinklers.com.  He completely replaced my irrigation system (front and back) replaced the valves and regulators.  His crew was on time, professional, courteous and went above and beyond what was expected.  I would definitely recommend this company to friends and family.
1	A total disappointment.  Met with the owner, got a bid and authorized the work and they never came back.  Multiple calls and emails - they never responded.  Extremely unprofessional.Brian in Sun Lakes
3	Scott performed our Initial services were great, he fixed all our irrigation issues as well as provided quality plants at affordable prices, BUT after everything was in place he pretty much disappeared and did not follow up with what he said he would do such as adjustments to the plants.He also forgot to do some work that was in the initial job scope that we wanted to get done.Tried to get more services but seemed like a slew of excuses, or did not respond to an agreed upon week in which he would come out and scoop out a new work order. Hes good and affordable, but his communication is extremely lacking...so take it at that if you want his services...
5	Mike came out to troubleshoot our sprinkler systerm today and he showed up on time.  He was EXTREMELY honest and found no problem with the issues we called him out for.  We expected to be billed for his time and he didn't even charge us for the trip.  He offered to come back as needed if the issues arose again.  HONESTY is the best policy and we will definitely call them again if we have any trouble!  Thank you for being someone we can trust not to rip us off!  Great work!
