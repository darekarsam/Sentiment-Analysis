4	Gourmet comfort food. An oxymoron? I think not! Highly recommended. I had the Le Burger au Boeuf Braise with Poutine fries. Unbelievable.
2	I was surprised. The food looked really good from afar, but it didn't taste very good. The food was bland, and missed a lot of oppurtunities to be an excellent dish. The burger patties were small and dry, and the Bleu cheese on the burger was more of a bottled dressing than the delicious sauce that was advertised. The pulled pork pouting was mediocre, the sweetness of the pork and slaw didn't mix very well with the generic fries and gravy the poutine offered. The onion rings were good but weren't worth the 6 dollar price tag. Service was excellent, however. Overall it was an OK experience, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it and I won't be going back.
4	There was a strange smell to this place but the poutines were so good! I may have to go out on a limb and say I preferred the poutines here over La Banquise... The poutine choices are limited but the fries are crispy, and the flavour combinations feel more well thought-out than my beloved banquise...
4	I love this place. Service is excellent. Restaurant is very nice and clean. I have been here around 8 times and the food has been pretty good always. Prices are very reasonable. The onion rings with honey sauce are by far the best onion rings I've had in my entire life. Pulled pork burger is really good. Fish and chips are ok. They brew their own beer and it's also pretty good. I will definitely recommend it.
4	The burgers here are absolutely delicious. I would definitely go back here again when I head back to Montreal....and oh their prices are so reasonable to boot.
