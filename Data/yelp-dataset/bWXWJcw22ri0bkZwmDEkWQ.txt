4	I wasn't thrilled with their new Specialty Chicken (bacon & tomato), but the BBQ wings & pepperoni pizza were great.  BTW, I received the specialty chicken for free through their Facebook page, so I didn't feel ripped off.
5	The pizza was hot, the order was correct, I ordered the pizza to be delivered at a set time and it was on time and most important, it was fresh, cooked just right and it tasted great!Best Dominos in the Southern Nevada area!
1	In fact the service for my order was so damn bad, i decided to register to yelp and write a review for all to know...First time i order from dominos online, i get this store, place my order, pay online and everything is does fine...Except it's been over an hour and i'm still waiting for my order to arrive, according to dominos online order tracker, my order has been out for delivery for 64 minutes.... What kind of service is that, i'm currently on the phone to complain with the manager, and guess what, it's been 9 minutes since my called was answered by their system, and i can't even speak to a human, all they got is a recording of all their specials... UPDATE: just hanged up with the store's manager told me to call the general manager at the store in Sahara and Valley View... called there, and their manager shouted to me on the phone, you can tell they are having a lousy day, but i'm not the one to blame... i'm just another customer that ordered and payed for a pizza, because he was hungry, and 2 hours later i'm still hungry because of them, now i'll have to wait for 3 to 5 days to get my money back?, that's what happens when you order from this place...Next time i'll just order from Pizza Hut or Papa John's, who BTW i'm sure are really thankful of how Domino's treats their customers...Please look at the attached picture, so you can see by yourself...
