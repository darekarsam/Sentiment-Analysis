5	Updated rooms, great location, quiet and clean. Loved it!
1	Doesn't deserve a star. This place needs to be demolished. Terrible! We walked in and the room smelt of old Indian food. The table was broken. The bathtub had curly black hairs in it and the towels had multi-color stains on them.
3	Normal hotel room nothing too crazy but the service was amazing. And the hotel was very clean.
4	We stayed here for 10 days in between moving out of a home and into a new one.  The location is good...many restaurants and grocery stores around.  The room wasn't anything special...bed, bathroom, kitchenette.  It was clean and the service was great.  The only issue we had was the toilet kept running.  We got maintenance to change a part but it didn't fix the issue.  They came three times and it didn't work any time so we just left it.
