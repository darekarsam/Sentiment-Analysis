3	I had high expectations for this cute little bakery and pastry shop. Everything looked and smelled delicious. However, I was not very impressed with my cafe au lait and the almond croissant that I tried was very flavorful, but filled with a bit too much almond paste for my liking. It was overwhelming. I might stop in again if I am in the area and try their breads and other baked goods, however.
5	My colleagues brought me here when I started working in Outremont and I was a convert after just one sandwich. The buns they use are always fresh and amazing....oh and also highly addictive. The pastries, don't even get me started. Let's just say that it is a good thing that this place isn't right next door or else it would be truly damaging to my waistline. Everything here is fabulous and worth every penny. Don't arrive hungry and make sure to get there early as the lunch crowd is sizeable.
4	Pretty much everything I had was fresh and tasty. The place always had some people waiting in the lobby waiting to order something at all times, which probably means that it's a place that has a following. I give it a thumbs up too.
5	So delicious!
5	It doesn't get much better than this. After having lived in France, this place is just as good as anything you'll find there. What's more, it's at least 30% cheaper than comparable places in Toronto (where I live). I shared a sandwiche classique, a croissant aux amandes, a croissant au fromage and a quiche au salmon, and I wouldn't have changed a thing about any them. It was a large and very comfortable cafe as well. I'd recommend to anyone.
4	Nice casual seating upstairs, friendly, well-organized service (remember to take a number!) and some really well-done baked goods. Not the best I've had in my life, but well up in the top of Montreal's selection.
5	Best Cafe in Outremont to work in.Sofa, couch, confortable chairs at the second floor.All the viennoiseries look magnificent.Breads are awesome. Cheese Croissant are so good.
