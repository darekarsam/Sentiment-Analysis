5	Jeremy is an excellent Chiropractor in Charlotte, NC. I was referred to him after I was in a car accident and he was able to get me pain free within weeks of visiting him. Highly recommended.
5	Dr. Hozjan is a wonderful Chiropractor. He has a really good touch and I always walk out of his office feeling better. He treats you as a whole person not just your spine. I would recommend him to anyone.
5	Let me start off by saying that this office and Dr. Jeremy Hozjan has earned each and every one of these 5 stars in my book.I have been to several chiropractors over the course of my life and never has one been so thourough in their history taking or examination. Dr. Hozjan never makes me feel rushed or pressured. He consistently asks questions and takes detailed notes on my responses.  You immediately feel at ease with him.I also love that Dr. Hozjan is genuinely interested in healing and creating plans to lead you to complete health and wellness. He utilizes supplements to assist you in the healing process but explains where to get the supplements in natural foods so that you don't have to take pills for the rest of your life.I feel safe, comfortable, and already on the road to a healthier lifestyle, thanks to Jeremy.  I'm also grateful that his office staff is welcoming and attentive, and I appreciate Judy, who always emails me my receipts when I ask, to make flex-spending claims easier.
5	I love everything about Charlotte Natural Healing. The entire staff is so warm and welcoming and I'm always smiling when I leave. I'm in and out in 30 minutes, most times less. Dr. Hozjan is wonderful. He really knows his stuff and I can tell he cares about the wellbeing of his patients. I would and have recommended Charlotte Natural Healing to friends and family.
