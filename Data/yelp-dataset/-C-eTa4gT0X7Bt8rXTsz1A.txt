2	Great idea. Badly executed. Queue to get in. Queue to get beer. Queue for a seat. The tent is big, but full with people looking to get a bierhalle Oktoberfest experience, which in my opinion was hard to find. No schlagers, no dancing maidens. Blearing wedding party songs. Food was warm. Beer was cold. That's it. no atmosphere. shame, I really wanted to enjoy it.
3	Edinburgh's first Oktoberfest was held in Princes St Gardens this year. Although it was a bit disorganised with huge beer queues, it certainly helped having an Itison voucher on their first day (Wed) so we had table service for the half pints and German sausages that came on our deal. Otherwise, there was unfortunately no table service and crazy queues. The live band was good although the DJ played mostly '70s hits and it was a bit off target for the Oktobefest theme. That said, the ambiance was fun and it was a good night out. Mid-week there was free entry to the venue although over the weekend it was ticketed.
2	Excited at the thought of Oktoberfest in Edina & I grabbed a couple of VIP tix for the Friday night. It was busy by the time we arrived & the beer & music had people up dancing on the benches & tables.The table service was quite chaotic. The waitress forgot our drinks a couple of times & on another occasion gave our order to people at the next table. The queue for the bar was ridiculous.I was disappointed at the music, like other reviewers it was more late night dodgy disco/wedding tunes than I had expected.  I'd give it another shot if I returns next year but I'm not sure I'd cough up for VIP tix again.
