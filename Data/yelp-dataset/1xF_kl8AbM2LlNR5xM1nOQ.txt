5	I've gone to both Jeff & Karen. Both very friendly and experienced never had problem with any of my color or cut. I've been going to them for years and alwayd refer to tthem
5	Great salon in Las Vegas! I love that they have a barber section as well as a full salon section. Being able to get your nails done AND hair done in one trip is awesome!! Lots of parking, great selection of hair products to keep my tresses tamed between appointments. All of that mixed with some talented professionals who arnt pretentious , makes this this my go to spot. I highly reccomend it if your looking for a down to earth place in Vegas.
1	I can not speak of their stylist ability as they decided to close early. I knocked at the door, that they locked 35 mins early. Locked. The Manicurist chose to ignore my knocking, but the customer there said something to her, and looked my direction. I obtained their phone number and called. The woman who answered apologized for locking the door and said she would come let me in. However, as she opened the door for me, she smiled and said, "We closed for the day. Sorry." o.O Outstanding service.
