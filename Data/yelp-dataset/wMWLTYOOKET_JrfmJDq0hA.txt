5	Blackbox Theatre has so many fun shows going on. My favorite is the improv show. Playing games like the dating game or Shift left. Its hilarious! If you would like to find good entertainment that is different than just going to the movies all the time, come here. You won't be disappointed.
3	My friend and I loved the production of Ruthless and the theater was very attractive and well laid out.  However, we will not be back because of the small, hard theater seats.  We are over 50, and it was very uncomfortable.  We are of average size, but there were several obese folks around us, one seated next to us.  Like the small airline seats, it's not their fault, but the larger person overlapped into my friend's seat, so she had to shift and intrude on my seat, I had to lean to the other side, thereby causing the person next to me to have to change seats with someone because all that leaning leads to touching arms, even if you are holding yourself rigid trying not to.  Too bad they had to skimp on seats.  Perhaps they should have a section of oversize seats that the ushers could tactfully mention to them.
