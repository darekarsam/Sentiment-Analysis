5	My HOA recommended The Pigeon Specialist. I talked to Barry about my problem with some pigeons, he was very understanding and had a few different directions available to go. We set up an appointment for a free estimate. We discussed different options and after giving me knowledge of what pigeons do and what each option does, we came up with a good solution for a very FAIR price! I chose a heavy duty cage wire, not a netting or chicken wire. The workers came on the assigned day and knocked out the troublesome spots. The workers were very polite and attentive to any concerns I had. I had 1 question and they resolved it even though it was not necessary for the job. That's customer service! If I have any issues over the next week or so they will return to resolve. Again, customer service! I highly recommend you give The Pigeon Specialist a call and give them a try. You will not be sorry!!  Thank you !!!
4	I worked with Scott on this, and he's legit. I initially had some work done to install bird spikes on some ledges and cross beams and it was done quickly and at a fair price. I then had another need for some netting to prevent pigeon access to a ledge. They again came out quickly and at a good price, but I wasn't 100% satisfied as the metal attachments looked very noticeable and my discussions with Scott emphasised the need for a 'low profile', blended look. After another couple of calls, Scott sent his team out to paint the metal attachments and it looks much better. A pretty solid company, and I'd call them again for any more work.
3	Did a good job on installing the netting and removing old spikes.  However, left a massive amount of nails, tacks, and random metal pieces all over my driveway (probably found 15-20 pieces so far).  Four days later I'm still finding metal pieces sharp enough to puncture a tire.  Would have appreciated proper cleanup especially given the price.  Told the secretary and never heard a word back.  Otherwise they were fine.
