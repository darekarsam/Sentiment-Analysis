5	The Pittsburgh cheese steak is to killer! Marinara peppers French fries onions and of course that tender steak and melty cheese! The customer service from this family owned  shop is out standing! I think I've found my new favorite shop
4	Great "pie!!!" Me and the family had a pepperoni and sausage pie that was awesome, great flavor, crust wasn't to thick or thin, just right. Keep up the good work guys and good luck!
5	Was in town for the weekend and found this place with some help from friends.Had a GREAT basic pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms!!  Crust was perfect and plenty of pep and mush.  I'll be sure to stop next time in Vegas!!
