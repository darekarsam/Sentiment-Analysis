5	I love the pizzas here. The crust is positively delicious! I never get that nasty crash I do from other pizzas. The Superbiotic on skinny crust is my favorite! The staff here is always friendly and they have me coming back atleast 2-3 times a week! I've had delivery too and they're always prompt! Like they say when they answer the phone, "It's a great day to get Naked!"
4	Pizza toppings feature a huge variety!  I went in two nights in a row.  The first night i tried the Sonoran Special (chicken/mushroom...).  It was delicious!  Very flavorful, like no other pizza I've tasted.Then the next night I tried out a Superbiotic (several veggies) but I subbed out regular cheese for a soy cheese.  It was pretty gross, but I was curious.   It was too cheesy, I didn't like the texture.I just stick to the regular cheese next time but yeah I hope this place stays because I really like it!  Did I mention the special crust??  Very yummy!
4	This chain is really something special.  I just wish there were more around.  I love that their pizzas are a healthy alternative to traditional ones.  I also love that their pizza doesn't leave me feeling sick and bloated.  I wouldn't say it is the best pizza ever but it does the trick.  The crust/cheese isn't perfect but it comes real close.The online nutritional information is solid and I can't believe how the quality of their ingredients cuts down on the calorie/fat/carb/etc. content.I can't wait to return but it probably won't be for a while because their locations aren't close to anything for me.  I purposely drove like 15 miles to pick up a pizza from here after hearing about it from Mark Cuban's Twitter feed.  However, it was worth the trip to get something healthy, delicious, and unique.
4	Great pizzas with a nice variety of toppings.  We get the mediterranean and love it.  Have also tried the smokehouse and cheese, both were very good.  Would like more sauce on the pizzas, but otherwise, super!
