5	I loved this gym so much that I signed up even though I'm under contract at another gym, I love the decor, the staff is amazing, Joanne is the greatest trainer, tough but sweet! The best part of this gym is the one on one care you get and the sauna is heaven!
5	This is not your typical gym.  If you like gyms that are smelly, overcrowded and you're just another body scanning in, then you probably won't get this place.  If you want to be greeted by name in a fitness center where they really care about your goals and what your story is, then you must stop by and see what Elements is about.From the moment I stopped by just to "check things out", I have been treated most graciously by every staff member.  These are real people that own/manage this center.  The Benefits:Full Fitness Assessment - No, I didn't like some of the numbers I saw, but      you have to know where you're at, so you know where you need to go.FREE Session with the trainer to introduce newbies like me to the machines and the proper way to use them, this was priceless to me, as it took away the intimidation factor.You get to choose the pricing/fitness plan that fits your needs, no one size, one price fits all here.Machines - The machines are new, well kept and very easy to use.Classes -  They have interesting and fun classes.  Yoga, Pilates/Pilates Barre, Zumba, Toning and Stretching, the list goes on as they keep adding new classes based on interest.  The instructors are amazing as well.  It is quite obvious they were chosen with much care and are highly qualified in their specific certifications.  Whether you're a recovering couch potato or a fitness godess, there is something here for you.
