5	Whitney and Evan are incredibly trustworthy and share an amazing amount of knowledge. I recently had a problem fixed that's left me guessing for months. They know what they're doing, no BS. I live across country but wait to have my car serviced until I'm in Charlotte visiting family. I wouldn't go anywhere else. Thanks ya'll!
5	Had my accord worked on here a couple years ago.  My belts were squealing and I couldn't figure out why.  It did not take them long to find it.  Inferior aftermarket belts :(  They replaced the belts with Honda belts and they never made another sound.  These guys know Hondas.  My only problem now is I don't own a Honda anymore..........I would recommend this place to anyone.  Very Satisfied.
5	What a hidden gem this place is!  If you have a Honda, you're lucky, because not only are Evan and Whitney knowledgeable and trustworthy - they also charge a fraction of what the dealer would charge.  They deliver solid diagnosis and repairs and they volunteer information to help you make good decisions.  For instance, my Accord V6 is due for a timing belt.  Not only did I receive a  very competitive estimate, but Whitney also gave me the rundown on the belt tensioner, the O rings, and the motor mount.  Now I know up-front, before the car is in the shop undergoing a major repair, what else might be involved.  I cannot recommend this place enough!  Smart people with great work ethic and integrity.
