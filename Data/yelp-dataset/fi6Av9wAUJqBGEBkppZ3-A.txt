2	Their extensive TV advertising had me thinking they could get anything out.  Well, they couldn't get the fireplace soot out of my carpet.  The technician tried really hard.  I asked him if he had anything to spray on it and he went out to the van and got something that didn't work.  I went and got some Spot Shot out of the closet, so then he went back out to the van to get something stronger.  No luck.  Then he tried to upsell me on carpet protection, but the last thing I want is to "protect" the stain "in"!  In addition, he tried to sell me the same spot remover that didn't work on the soot and   I asked him why I would buy a spot remover that clearly didn't work!?!?!  I have used Stanley Steemer in the past to clean my carpets and was pleased.  Unfortunately, this time it was for stains and it didn't work.  :(
4	I had them come out and clean my couch.  It was a couch bought from a friend that had a lot of dog hair and old dog smell in it.  They did a great job explaining what they were doing as they went along.  Very fastidious work and they try very hard to make sure it is as clean as possible.  They were honest with me saying the deodorizer is good, but the amount of smell in my couch might take a few more rounds to get out. Regardless, the couch is wonderfully clean and the smell is so faint, I can live with it until the next routine cleaning in 2 years.  I highly recommend them.
1	Their crew chief, TJ Hunsberger is a convicted felon and thief. Assault and robbery. Do you want him in YOUR home??? Unethical company that doesn't background check. Don't hire them.
