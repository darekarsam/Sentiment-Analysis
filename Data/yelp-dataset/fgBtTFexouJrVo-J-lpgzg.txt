4	Kids r kidsJones & tropicana locationMy son J. O. Was with them for 5 years, it's been owe some 5 years , the staff were friendly  they cared about the kids.  I like the facts that I can watch him through "Watch me Grow" because the first week or so is hard to leave your kids to strangers.  My son love his teachers.  Keep up the good work........  The only thing that bother me is the playground wood chips, always in my son shoes -- a lot of wood chips......  Other than that  the place is great, friendly staff and care about the kids.
3	Update: policy needs to change! I came in with a credit card to pay because I didn't have time to go to my business to get a check nor to the bank to get cash for the drop-in fee... Needless to say the policy of "no credit card transactions under $50" is a huge pain. I have a business and I accept credit cards for any amount. I know your credit card merchant does not charge you more for transactions under $50 and I know that the % would be the same either way, I also know your company charges 2% for any credit card transaction to us the parents. Why have a credit card machine at all when you have imposed so many restrictions and charges on top of the exorbitant amount of tuition your company charges?  Even though I love the teachers and "some" of the staff ... policies need to change.
5	Great place. We needed a temporary day care and Traci was very helpful. Our two daughters loved it here. The older one was upset we didn't take her there earlier, they didn't want to leave. We were also able to watch them throughout the day, which was comforting.
