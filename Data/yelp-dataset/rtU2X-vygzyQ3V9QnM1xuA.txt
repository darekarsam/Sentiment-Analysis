5	I just foumd this shop near my work and im pretty stoked.  I am bumping up from an auto,. To a variable and next step is a mechanical or hybrid.  These guys are patient and super nice and let me ask lots of questions,  too much info online.  I recommend jon  and tao to help you out if your new like me.  Also 10% off for checking in-nice bonus!
5	The guys here are super friendly! Upon coming here a couple times, a month apart, their customer service hasn't changed and they try to help you as best they can. Staff is knowledgeable and well informed, so they should answer any questions you may have.They carry starter kits up to mechanical mods so they rebuild if you need one quick. As for ejuice, they carry a couple known brands as well as their own house mixes, which is nice.Their prices are good, not the best, not the worst so if you're in the area, it wouldn't be a bad idea to stop by and check it out. As far as i saw, there were no authentic mods here, so if you are into the replica collecting scene you may find something here you don't have yet.Simple enough 5/5 for customer service and fine juices.
5	Great and extremely friendly!  In September, I was in Las Vegas visiting family and stumbled across their shop and decided to stop by.  Needless to say I bought a lot of eLiquid and it is awesome!  I am not from the continental US, but I will be definitely returning when I am visiting Las Vegas.  Going to contact them to see how I can purchase more liquid!
