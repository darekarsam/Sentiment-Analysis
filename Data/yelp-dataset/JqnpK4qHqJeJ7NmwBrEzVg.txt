5	I have worked with Tim and his crew on more then one job. They are on time and very professional. Theirs pricing is very competitive for what you get. They are the best cabinet finishers in all of the metro area and I have most of the different finishers work. There is no problem that they have not encountered before and been able to solve them all.
5	Chuck Derouen and his crew (John and Hunter especially) did an awesome job in my kitchen and bar.  In fact, they exceeded my expectations!  They were punctual, patient, professional, and perfectionists.  I could not be more pleased with the results!
5	Timely, do what they say, a first-rate experience.  Use these guys.
