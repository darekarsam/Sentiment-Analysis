4	This is a real Jamaican bar. Like 95% of the folks there are Caribbean and the music is loud and the beer is cheap... or so i remember.There's also a big back deck outside with a stand that sells solid Jamaican food. I had some curry chicken and tried my buddy's oxtail with both being quite tasty.Things don't get popping here till 1pm so be warned.
4	Real reggae music, occasional artists performing live, dancing, and inexpensive drinks.  Small club, however gives you a taste of what its really like in a local island bar.
4	First time i went, it was amazing & fun. I came at 10:30 so i got in free and people dont show up until like 1 so at first i was just like oh this shit is boring but when it hit ! or 2 a.m. it was sooo fun. They dont close til 5 or 6 a.m. So before 11 it's $10 and after 2 it's $20. Soo i decided to go back the weekend after and it was a shit load of old people, and another thing that i dont like its that a few guys cant take no for an answer but i will definitely go again in the future.
