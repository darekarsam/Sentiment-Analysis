1	So unprofesional !!! Stylist are always late, yes its cheap but you dont know what they gonna do to you! The students look like They dont want to be there most of the time!!! Will never go back!!!!!
4	I had a pleasant experience.  They were quick to find me a stylist (as I had no appointment) and the stylist took her time with my hair. I could not expect more; especially with a $5 price tag!!!
1	Trust me don't go hereWorst experience I had. I went for hair cut . just wanted simple trimming and layers. She was a student and took long long time to cut my hair. Moreover she was so confused and didn't know how to do it. She asked help from here supervisor and supervisor says" you know it and you do it".she showed nothing .what the hell you do it. It's my hair. I have been to some beauty school before and supervisor never leave a person alone after she says she don't know it. At least show her how to do. After an hour she finished. She did nothing, not at all and I show that supervisor was just sitting and talking to it hers and laighing... is this a joke?
