5	This is the 3rd daycare we went to when we moved to Las Vegas.  Although it was difficult to change daycares three times within the first few months it was well worth it.  It made us realize how poor the first two were after being at Hand in Hand.They treat our two boys (ages 1 and 2) so well and they love it there.  They get great socialization and a learning curriculum.  Really highly recommended to any parents trying to decide on a daycare, you can tell the front desk ladies and teachers are genuine and not just there for a paycheck.
5	I absolutely love this Preschool (not daycare). I have two boys and my first son has gone to three different Daycare/Preschools. My youngest has been to only one other daycare and by far this is the best at of all of them. The amount you pay her is not bad for the education they give your child. You do have to bring lunch but I actually prefer it this way because my son can be picky so I know what I am packing for him  he will eat. The teachers and staff are all friendly and pleasant to speak with. They have a great curriculum. My son just turned 4 and writes very good (sometimes better them my oldest) he is learning how to add and is loving. They make it fun for the kids so its easy for them to catch on. I would definitely recommend coming to visit this preschool.
5	This is the only place I will trust with my son.  He loved it here since day one... And I like how the director knows my sons name even when he's only been going here for a month.     I just love it here!
4	Our little one loved everyone at the school and we are signing er up for another year here.  Everyone in the office knows the children's names and their families.  Very friendly.
