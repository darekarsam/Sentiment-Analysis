4	I met a colleague here for lunch and we dined in the Grille area.  He works in Fountain Hills and picked this place.  It's kind of out of the way for me, but the food here is solid, so I can't complain.I had the Cheeseburger Sliders and Fries.  They were excellent.  Service here is impeccable.  The servers made sure we were well attended to and kept our drink glasses full.  I'd like to come back and have dinner sometime.The vibe here is stuffy country club...so if that's not your deal, don't come here.Return Factor - 90%
5	Outstanding club.  Course is amazing and fun, even for a lousy golfer like me.  The service on and off the course is first class.  I am not a member but I am treated as such.  I have been here several times and will continue to return when I am in town, as long as I am invited :)
5	Wow! Does FireRock know how great they are?!   I'm sure people tell them all the time, considering they are absolutely fabulous in more ways than I can count! Outstanding views which is a given.  Beautiful clean restrooms loaded with amenities.Service was exceptional. I worked with Karen and she was great!  In every way I couldn't help but notice the entire staff at Firerock shows how much they care by all they do. They are kind, generous and go out of their way to be helpful. They were simply amazing.There's no better country club to host your event!Dinner- the food was delicious, delectable, delightful! I'd be happy to come back any time. The salmon salad was worth loosing my right arm for. The steak was of the most tender it melts in your mouth, even the burger and perfectly seasoned sweet potato tater tots, onion rings will keep my friends and I talking for days. Looking forward to returning for many memorable meals! I'm delighted to have shared an event in such a beautiful space!!!Good times, good food, good friends- thanks for a wonderful evening Firerock, I'm convinced, you can't be beat!
