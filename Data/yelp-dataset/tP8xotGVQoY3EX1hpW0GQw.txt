5	Awesome service. It was prompt and very detailed.
3	Located on 5th Ave Toss't is a specialty salad shop. But unfortunately there isn't anything too special about it. Fresh ingredients but shrug I dunno. They have a pretty decent selection of their own specialty salads but ill stick to mixing and matching.With the make your own salad option you get (1) green(4*) tossed items (1) crunch I.e croutons etc(1) dressingProteins, cheese, and more tossed items are extra.Considering they've only been open a short time meaning 1 day they've got a ton of kinks to work outFriendliness of staffKnowledge of their own menuNot over stuffing their salad but I'm sure they'll be fine.
1	Not impressed after my first visit today.  The line is very long but seemingly has no order inside the small space.  When I finally received my order, it was the wrong salad altogether (despite my receipt with my name and order on it inside the bag with the salad).  Naturally, I was back at my office by the time I realized this and made the best out of a salad filled with salmon that I can't stand.  I probably wouldn't bother going back despite walking by it every day at lunch time.  They need to get better at managing their volume and get their staff up to speed on how to make sure customers are getting the right food. The end of their process is too rushed and they obviously can't handle it yet.
1	Went to Toss't it today. I am very displeased.I ordered a custom salad in a wrap.There was a disproportionate amount of lettuce (kale and spinach) to the rest of the ingredient. Basically it was a wrap with kale and a couple of morsels of corn, chicken, and tomatoes. They forgot my cranberries. The wrap fell apart in my hand. The tortilla was unappetizing.Extra for chicken around $2 for 4 small cubes of chicken. Extra for avocado around $1.50 for 3 slices of avocado.There was no comfortable place to sit and the organization of the space was terrible. $10 salad wrap? NOT WORTH IT.
