1	DO NOT GO HERE! The guy in charge of this place will rip you off. My car now has more problems than when I originally went and he took advantage of the fact that I'm just a student... overcharged by way too much.
5	Lou's, compared to another inspection place on Baum boulevard:-Half the price of its competitor-Fixed items I didn't even know about-Honest staff-Friendly-Experienced
5	I'm a fan! I needed to get a state inspection and an oil change. They charged less than $70 for the inspection and the standard rate for my oil change (my car only takes synthetic oil, so it's typically around $60.) I called to schedule the inspection and they said to just bring it in whenever. They got my car in right away and were done in an hour. All the guys there were extremely friendly and joke around with you quite a bit. They are much cheaper than the alternatives nearby and are extremely nice. They also run the Citgo gas station on Centre which still has full-service pumps. When someone pulled up to the full-service pump the guy inside (might have been the owner) told him to go around to the self-service pumps because it would be cheaper for him unless he wanted full-service (which most people don't even realize is full-service). These guys definitely aren't trying to squeeze money out of you.
