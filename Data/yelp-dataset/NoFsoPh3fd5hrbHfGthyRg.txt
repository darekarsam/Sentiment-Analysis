5	I got referred by a friend to Novak laser boutique to get a photofacial to get rid of the sun spots on my face.  After my 2nd treatment I'm starting to like my self again I'm absolutely loving the results.  I'm definitely going to continue doing my Photofacials. Thanks novak for all your help, I now will be part of your schedule for long!
5	I am so happy I found Novak!!! Jenny is so professional. She took the time to asked me my beauty goals and help me to make a plan and during the treatment she was always asking how I was feeling. This my second treatment and I am already seeing the results.
5	Bought a groupon for VelaShape and saw Amy for treatment. She was really nice and professional and best of all did everything to make me comfortable and get the best results. After three treatments i saw great results and i am buying more! Ive bought quite a few groupons for the laser lipo type treatments and this is the ONLY one that gave results. The office is modern and clean and the machines are the newest models. They get my business for sure.
5	Service was professional and Amy was very informative. I would definitley recommend this place of business for services. Receptionist is is very courteous and makes you feel welcome.
