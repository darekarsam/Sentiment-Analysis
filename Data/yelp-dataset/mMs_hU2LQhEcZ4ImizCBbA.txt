3	A good neighborhood Indian restaurant. Food is tasty, service and setting is nice.
2	This is A-OK Indian food in Verdun. They have quick delivery and the food is ok. Of course I have tasted better, but that would mean that I would need to go to Parc Extension or Downtown to get better stuff. If you live in Verdun, this is a good place to order your take out or delivery from.I have not actually sat in the restaurant, but I have walked by it, and it seems ok.
4	Food is very good, service is excellent. Have been more than a dozen times and looking forward to go again.
1	I placed an order with them for delivery and they couldn't find my place. Instead of calling me when they were near my building they drove back to the restaurant and called me. I waited 2 hours to get my food and then still had to pay for it. The food is good but I won't order from them again because of the terrible service.
