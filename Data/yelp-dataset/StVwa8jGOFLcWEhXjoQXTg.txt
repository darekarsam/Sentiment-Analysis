5	Wow, this is a nice new place with great service! I bought a month pass via Groupon and just after redeeming my first day, I realized "DAMN!" I was going to be out of town for 2 weeks of the month I just purchased. I mentioned it to Ashley, the manager there just to see if there was anything we could do about that, and she went above and beyond to work with me so I didn't lose those weeks. THIS is great customer service, THIS is how you gain and keep customers. I'm very grateful for her help. On top of this, she ALWAYS remembered me as I walked in the door, even on my second visit! I never waited longer than a minute for a bed and the place is spotless. I will continue to come here even after my month expires. Just takes one act of good customer service to change a new customer into a repeat customer. Thanks Ashley! See you again soon!
2	I have tanned in their versa spa four times with a 5 time pass. This last time they upgraded me to the bronzer (normally a $10 up charge) they did give me that for free because I stated I didn't get any color the previous times. This time was not much better. Barely a darker color for around three days, then gone. I don't know if it's the formula they use but regardless, I wouldn't spend any more money on their spray tan machine.
5	I came here with a Groupon, $19 unlimited tanning for a whole month which including airbrush, versa spray, and tanning bed. I was really surprised how cheap it was!I decided to go in for an airbrush spray tan, I called in and made an appointment. Ashley was very knowledgeable about the services and was very helpful. She even picked out the perfect airbrush color to go with my skin tone without looking "orange". My airbrush lasted about 2 weeks! I was very pleased. It lasted way longer than any other spray tan I've had at other places.  I definitely recommend going here.
