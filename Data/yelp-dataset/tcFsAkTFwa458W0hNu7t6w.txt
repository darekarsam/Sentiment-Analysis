3	Since moving to Vegas Im still looking for a barber that can cut my hair like my barber did in Scottsdale. Ive tried 5 different shops so far and still looking for that one magical barber. Perhaps I will not find him but rest assured Ill keep looking!GVBS.. Solid barber skills and extremely friendly. I think it was $14 for a cut.

1	I walked into this barbershop on a Saturday at noon.  I noticed the "Walkins Welcome" sign painted on the glass.  The place had one other customer sitting in the chair getting a cut.  I go to sit down and the barber says to me, "It's going to be a while."  I reply, "That's fine."  He says, "No, I'm not going to be able to give you a cut until 4:00 p.m.  I have appointments."  I walk out of the place thinking how could he have solid appointments from 12:00 p.m to 4:00 p.m. and there is no one else in the place except for the person in the chair.  If they don't want walkins they shoudn't have a sign saying "Walkins Welcome."
