5	The class was excellent.The owner,Mike is very knowledgeable about all the subjects that he covers.He makes sure you understand everything that he covered in class and on the shooting range.The best class ever!
5	Mike is a fantastic instructor. I took my CCW class through him and he makes sure to address everything legal and practical you will need to know for concealed carry, giving many sample scenarios and solutions. There are plenty of opportunities for the students to ask questions throughout the class. Secondarily, he managed to turn what would normally be a full day of dull, tedious (in my opinion), albeit very important material into an entertaining and educational presentation with his personality and sense of humor! His prices are reasonable too.
5	I just wanted to drop a note to thank you again for the excellent CCW instruction this past Sunday. Mike was as informative as can be and the scenarios presented were as close to everyday situations as you can get. We were in the private training in different situations. It's so fun!!I highly recommend this class to anyone looking to educate themselves on the carrying laws.
5	If you are applying for your Las Vegas CCW Permit, look no furthur for your trainer than Mike at "At The Ready"!. Mike offers personalized instruction based on your skill level. You think you know everything about shooting? Think again, I guarantee you will leave this class knowing more than when you went in.Mike is one of the best , most patient firearms instructors I have ever met.Las Vegas CCW - At The Ready - You won't be sorry.....
