4	Big fan of Dunn's due to a few reasons:- Opens 24/7- Smoked meat, smoked meat, and smoked meat!- Affordable price- Huge generous portions- Down to earth service, nothing fancy flashy, just people who do their job and do it correctly!Here are the cons though:- Sometimes limited choice if you go in the early AMs (1-6am)- Could taste better since Schwartz has better smoked meat than DunnsBut I'm a fan!
4	Michael covered most of the points here, so I'll hit and run. Love the 24h aspect, and I enjoyed my Dunn's spaghetti - (meat sauce and smoked meat). Service was fast (though our server lacked personality, but whatever...) and the prices were alright. I'll be back.
3	I am from Vancouver BC, never been to Dunn's before showing up here on a cold snowy night.I was really impressed with the smoked meat. Now I need to go visit the one we have on Seymour St. I didn't know we had.
5	Big fan of this place!! Been to other Dunns, this one is the best one so farGood food! Very good and fast service, nice staff, pretty big portions. Not because I'm a girl, my husband too loves this place.
1	Not the usual that would expect from Dunn's. Came in for breakfast with the family Sunday morning.  Eggs were cold, potatoes were cold. Service was polite but slow. As my wife put it "The best part of the breakfast was the slice of orange on the plate". I hope things improve for this "famous" place.
