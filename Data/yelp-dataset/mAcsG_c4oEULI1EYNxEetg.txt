5	This is a tiny place that is almost lost amidst the great selection of restaurants on Rue St. Denis, but it is a real find.There's nothing special about the decor or the service, but the sushi is amazing.  If you want to try something new in sushi, come here.  Try the dragon eye roll or the geisha roll.  They use fruit and rice paper in some of their rolls and their seafood is very fresh.  Got a chance to speak with the owner and he clearly takes pride in what he produces in this humble place.Oh, and bring a bottle of wine from the SAQ a block away.  He will bring you glasses and an ice bucket for free.Great place for kids too because there is a great selection for them to try.
5	Meilleur restaurant de sushis sur le plateau. Toujours un enorme plaisir d'y aller et surtout, le prix est plus qu'abordable. Les sushis sont tous plus bons les uns que les autres et le personnel est tres sympathique.
5	Nice personal touches on the food, everything fresh and flavorful! Worth a meal when in the neighborhood and priced reasonable. Owner/chef makes each dish with passion and treats his customers well! My wife and I will be back for another fine meal whenever we come back to the city of Montreal!
