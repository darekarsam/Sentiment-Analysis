5	I've been using his personal trainer services for almost 8 months. I couldn't have asked for a better training experience.  There are many different exercises he bring into the session that keeps it exciting and fun. He provides excellent healthy eating tips whenever we go over the "what did you eat today?" part of my session. He encourages when I feel like I don't want to go another set and motivates me to do better.Bootcamps are awesome!  Fun times with like minded people. Awesome services with reasonable pricing!
5	Love this place! No ridiculous crowds, or overfilled classes. Personal training and classes in a private environment with great people!
5	I have been going to the Madden Endurance gym since early 2014 and in 3 months I lost 15 pounds. My wife had another personal trainer and she stalled out on her weight loss progress. At the time she stopped losing she was 20 pounds from her goal. she has been with Tony for about 8 months are she is 5 pounds from her goal weight! Tony is a caring, passionate trainer who wont let you give up on yourself. He wants you to better than what you were when you walked through those doors. Unlike most classes, Tony isn't in it for the money.... He actually loves what he does & it shows in his clients.
