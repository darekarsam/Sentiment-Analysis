1	This is the worst dental experience, I have ever had. The receptionist and the dentist were both lacking in basic friendliness..They charged me 224.00, their ad on this web sites shows they charge new patients 39.00 exam and cleaning. it must be the xrays that cost 185.00. While the dentist was cleaning my teeth, he left me waiting in the chair while  he worked on two other patients.  I spent 90 minutes in the dental chair to get xrays and my teeth cleaned. .I let the receptionist know I was unhappy with my experience and ask the dentist to call me so that I could share my experience with him. He must not care about repeat customers... he never called. I called the owner of the company to share my experience. He was going to check into my experience...I never heard from him again either. If your looking for a dentist that doesn't care about customers, this is the right dentist to  spend your money with.
5	I was so relieved to find this place. After much searching I have finally found a place that is friendly, caring. competent, and considerate!I had a root canal done yesterday and I feel 100% better today. I was well taken care of and I will return with my son for treatment.The dentist explained the procedure and made it as pain free as possible. I was amazed !! I thought I'd be sore for a while but after the numbness wore off from the Novocaine I experienced some discomfort that was relieved by 400 mg of ibuprofen and then I was fine. Rosie in the front office was friendly and helpful and the dental assistant was friendly and kind.Thank you Sonrisa for a great dental experience!
1	If you are sent here due to a work related injury do more research. While the staff may seem friendly and helpful. Once 5 pm hits its time to go. Sorry if the work is incomplete we can start again tomorrow. I did not see the regular dentist so I can not speak about him. But in any event it us probably best to steer another direction
