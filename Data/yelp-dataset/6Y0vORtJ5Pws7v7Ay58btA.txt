5	I bought a chair, and it is excellent. Highly discounted, and just what I was looking for! They were efficient and professional. I was in and out, and ended up spending much less than what I expected to.

4	The showroom is very nice. They have assortment of cubicles, sitting furniture and regular office furniture. In the back behind the curtain they have a large selection of very used furniture at cheap prices. The manager assisted me and she was very helpful. I ended up purchasing a desk and drawers. The delivery fee was quite high at like $125? Something like that. Way to high in my opinion. The desk was delivered and of course my luck the top was damaged. I had told the manger about a bad experience with rc Wiley in which I had two desks delivers damaged. I was very surprised the desk was not checked as it was obviously damaged. Eddie, who delivered the desk, was sweet and offered to go back to the store to get me another one off the floor. He went right back and got me another one with no damage. Happy with my purchase. They are only open during the week which is a bummer but worth going here. Hope you have a truck or dang just rent one for the day at that delivery fee.
