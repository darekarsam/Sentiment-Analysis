5	This place is hip and cool - truly a great shopping experience. I recently needed a new belt and found not only the perfect sand color that I was looking for, but also experienced great customer service and an awesome selection. The staff isn't pushy which I really love - they let me take my time and yet managed to be helpful when I needed guidance. Ask for Dee - she's pretty cool.

There are a lot of well-made, high quality women's' and men's' clothes, plus accessories (jewelry and purses). The items on sale were super reasonably priced for the high quality or items; the non-sale items were pricey but you get what you pay for. I like how my family and I were able to browse the store at our leisure, and no one hovered over us or pressured us to try anything on or buy anything. The women's' section had a lot of jeans and gorgeous tops. My teen daughter found many things she loved, as I did, so I can surmise that this store caters to women, young and old (not that I'm old, mind you!). The woman behind the cash was friendly and non-obtrusive. If I weren't on such a tight budget, this is the place to go for nicer clothing!
