3	After 18 years of having to slow down almost every morning for folks to pull in here I did the same.  This place, which has no gas pumps, is always packed.  The morning I stopped in was no exception.  For being an older store the inside is in pretty good shape.
1	Store is a mess. They need to clean a little more. The fountain drink had been down for 3 days. It seems that corporate does not care. They should get that fixed fast because they sell a lot of fountain drinks here in the valley
