4	I was stuck in Charlotte for nerly four hours.  Fortunately, this airport has a very good spa in the terminal where you can relax.  I ordered the 60min deep tissue - which wasn't too deep, but it did take my mind off of flying.  The terminal spa also offers a military discount.  The cost is a bit more than I would like - but the spa is inside a busy airport - so I can't complain too much.  This spa offers a variety of different services, from quickie back massages, to footwork, facials, and up to a 90 min massage.  Check it out!
4	Professional and clean. Nice, friendly aesthetician and atmosphere. Very good pedicure for $45. They also offer manicures and various massages. Next time I may actually be happy about a long layover in Charlotte! And opt for a massage! Aah a foot massage . . .  Can I get a later flight?
4	I received a great treatment here. The price is high, but it is an airport. I paid 3.99 for water that is apx 2 $ less back home. So, spa services are in line. I came with knots in my shoulder and I left without them. I did not have any pain and was relaxed during session. I have had therapists get crazy and cause pain and knots still lingered-not here. Great job! Glad to bave stopped in :)
