1	This USED to be our families go to place! There was 1 other patient in the lobby. My child waited 1 hour in the lobby. The girl working the computer was very slow!! The service here has plummeted! Doctors and healthcare are horrible in nevada and now include this place as one of the worst. Find somewhere else
1	II went here looking for a primary care doctor. I made an appointment on Monday for the following Thursday the problem I was having had gotten worse so I had gone to UMC Quick care on Tuesday. They treated me and instructed me to keep my appointment and follow up with them. The UMC doctor told me that they would most likely want to do some more testing. I was early for my appointment, to get the paperwork done, but still waited for an hour after the time of my appointment. When I was finally called back the nurse took my vitals and I waited even longer for the doctor in the little room. The Doctor never came, instead a PA came in and said what UMC did was fine, she never even examined me. At that point I was just glad to be out. The only reason I would recommend them is if you wanted to make money in a law suit you would probably win after having them treat you.
1	The best thing about my involvement with Genesis Medical Group/Parkway Urgent Care was Physician's Assistant, Marie!  She has the right conception about what an individual working in the medical field is.  She possesses listening skills, she's professional, gives great advice within her realm of authority and definitely is compassionate!  Way-to-go, Marie!  Otherwise, this so-called healthcare facility is one of the worst I've seen in my entire life.  Nevada healthcare needs to step it up a few notches.
