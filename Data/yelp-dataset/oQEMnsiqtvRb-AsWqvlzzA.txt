2	Popped in here with Michelle B for a post-jog brunch last Sunday.  It's a lovely little space and has some fab art work and jewellery and knick-nacks for sale.  Great mixture of seating and tables and a proper turntable and old fashioned vinyl playing in the background. They even encourage you to bring along your own vinyl to play while you're in too, which is a cool idea.All looked and seemed promising enough but the food was not good.  I had a bacon roll, made with streaky bacon that was so crispy it fractured into hundreds of tiny pieces when I bit into it.  Also the roll was not fresh and they'd tried toasting it to make it better. It just crumbled too.  Very disappointing.  Lashings of red sauce did nothing to improve the texture or flavour.Michelle opted for a fruit scone. It looked nice but wasn't fresh either.  In fact, she said it was soo hard that i she "sconed" me with it, she'd need to take me to A&E.We did tell the chap who served us, in order to give him an opportunity to rectify matters but he just shrugged it off and presented us with the bill.  The only redeeming feature was the pot of tea.  It was lovely. But it's hard to ruin a pot of tea so I'm not sure how much that goes in his favour.I'd give it another try on another occassion. I'm not ready to write this place off yet. I'm hoping it was just an off day and the food/service will be better on a future visit.  It's got a great location with a fab view of the beach/sea so I hope it does improve.
