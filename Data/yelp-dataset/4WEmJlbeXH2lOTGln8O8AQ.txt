3	I really wanted to like this place, given the fun decor, the friendly service and the reasonably-priced grub. Unfortunately our feelings were mixed.  I had the nachos and my wife had the chicken pie.  The nachos were very so-so, with a single layer of cheese instead of an equitable distribution across the chips (leaving most of them bare and sad), bland canned black olives and processed chicken chunks.  The chicken pie wasn't great either.  The french onion soup, the coffee and the desserts were the highlights, with the darjeeling tea also being a bit disappointing.  Probably still worth a visit, but those two mains should probably be avoided.
4	This is the old KILO in the Gay Village and was one of my favorite places to meet friends for a slice of cake and tea. It's especially fun in the summertime when all the windows are wide open and it allows you to do some serious people-watching of the local colorful characters which walk by constantly.I haven't been here since the name change to "1000 Grammes" (= 1 kilo, get it?) but this place has always had consistently good cakes and deserts, teas, coffees and the like. Sandwiches and salads are pretty basic and nothing unique. This is more of a place to hang and chat with a great friend  than to concentrate on food so don't go in with high expectations for the food here aside from the cakes.
4	Excellent food and service. Nice ambiance wether it's to come study while eating cake or for a fun date.
3	It's a nice place for a lazy brunch, they have some light snacks, salads, sandwiches, etc.The dish I ordered tasted great, however I can't commend on its appearance. Nothing bad per se, but not exceptional.
2	Service was great but other than that the meal was very average. My meal contained several hairs. I also requested it without mayonnaise but it came with mayonnaise. The rose wine was nice and my boyfriend enjoyed the beer he ordered.
