1	Working with Honeyman is like trying to work with a weasel.  Unreliable, cuts corners, Has no concept of or concern for quality, just the pennies in his pocket.  Honeyman represents the worst kind of contractor.  Unfortunately we did not do enough research and missed that he has had complaints to the contractors board and has filed a bankruptcy in the past.  Our installation was not to code in many areas.  I had to inspect every aspect of his work, and when asked to correct his work, he asked for more money.  Again, Weasel is the word that sums it up.call the Costco vendor if you want a good Lennox contractor.
5	Honeyman A/C is very professional, it all starts with the gal who answers the phone, she's always very professional and polite and schedules my appointments right away with urgency. When I need them, they are always available, Patrick, the owner is professional and courteous, always on time and knowledgeable. I've been in a service commitment with another local A/C company who hasn't always been the best, so when I needed repair work, I called Honeyman despite already being contracted with another A/C company and Honeyman has been great. I highly recommend them for anything HVAC related. You'll be glad you did, especially in this industry, Honeyman is one of a kind, reliable, honest and ethical.
5	My husband and I are on a fixed income and called this business when the heat would not come on during the coldest Christmas on record, December 2014.  I got the owner who told me he had just bought the business and was really busy because of the cold weather.  I told him I was afraid the whole unit would need to be replaced because it is old.  Nevertheless he was able to check the unit and found some wires had been disconnected.  It was a simple fix and I am so thankful we didn't have to put out the money for a new unit.  I would recommend this company for the quick service and for being honest.  They could have sold us a whole new heater unit.
