3	So the store has been open for a week and its already n shambles.not enough cashiers buggies n middle of shoes etc
4	New location with a wide range of product...  Got a few things and ready to head back! The wife enjoyed it very much, as she wasn't able to make a quick decision (like I said many options to choose from in every department).
3	I love their new location! It's always clean and organized. I've come here many times but their womens/juniors section is so small... I'm never able to find anything. They do have nice items for the home which is the reason why I always return.
