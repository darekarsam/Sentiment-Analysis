4	Great service and "reasonable" prices.  They can sometimes take a long time to get stuff done, but for the most part they are all super friendly and ALWAYS do a great job!
5	I love this place! I've been coming here ever since my husband and I moved in. They have great prices I love getting the spa pedicures. They take their time and pay close attention to detail.I dont have a specific favorite person due to ibe tried them all. Their prices are consistent and they have a great program where you can save and use savings. They do amazing jobs on eye brows. Which I hate pain but I feel okay.I love their massages when getting a pedicure. The place is clean and is so refreshing.
5	Absolutely LOVED this place!!!  Great products(OPI, Avo Juice, etc...), great service, and my nails turned out so good.  They even have a rewards program to earn credit towards your future services.My nail tech was Vivian and she was wonderful, my nails look like they are ready for a photo shoot :) I am definitely coming back, my new favorite nail place!!!
