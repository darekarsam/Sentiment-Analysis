5	love this place. really helful and everyone is nice just be patient. Roxanne is awesome she has great customer service and is responsive to emails.
5	Empty sprint store w no wait?! Score!! Helped by two friendly employees and was in and out in 15 mins for a phone number change which they by the way informed me I could do for free online before I sat down. It was only $15 to have them do and I figured if I was already here why not. Located in a great shopping center with a Walmart and Lowes and TJmax. I ll def visit again if I need any service again.
2	Phone & Service are good but Sprint employees are a bunch of liars. They locked me into a 2 year agreement then nearly doubled my monthly bill the next month, went from $55/month to $95/month, plus a few minor hidden fees. I get the run around with no answers.
5	Every time I need help at Sprint, this team has always been able to produce great experiences.
5	They are awesome at this location. There staff is very helpful and know there product. If you ever have issues and live in henderson this is the place to take ur phone. They will have it fixed up for u in no time at all. They are the only location me and my family go. The even though we have the Sunset location less then 1 min away they can't ever fix anything and half the time they know nothing about your phone. They just send u to the Eastern store anyways.
1	I purchased a phone and was given two "free" tablets by my salesman Greg. He put in writing that I would receive a $60 credit after three months and that I could cancel my data plans after 90 days. I didn't receive the $60 credit and I wasn't allowed to cancel my data plans without penalty. I filed a complaint with the BBB and Amanda from Sprint contacted me but she did not resolved the issues. Apparently,  Sprint allows their sales staff to lie and deceive their customers! BEWARE.
