2	Went to the store to order a deep dish pizza with pepperoni/sausage on one side and ham/pineapple on the other side. The guy kept getting the order wrong and I had to correct him two times and finally someone came over to help. When I got home I found that they sliced the pizza into 16 slices with each one being less than 2 inches wide. Pizza tasted good but I will not be using this location again.
5	We've been buying pizza from this Domino's since the day it opened.  Although we are infrequent pizza buyers, it is nice to know we can count on the easy ordering system online as well as fast, polite delivery service.  Is there better, fancier pizza in the marketplace?  Sure - but none as good at this price point.  Two bucks for delivery is reasonable, too.  Keep up the good work.
3	I've had mixed results from this location. The food is usually right with at least one caveat each time.Recently, our order included cinnamon sticks, which I thought probably aren't supposed to have powdered cheese and herbs on them... One of the pizzas was cut by someone who may have been having a stroke. The senseless disregard for straight lines doesn't bother me as much as Domino's disregard for the health of their workers. (I joke, but seriously, what's with the hexagonal pieces?)The delivery guy forgot the receipt I was to sign, and tried to get me to sign on a sticker. He said that he'd get it, but he never came back.Strange happenings.
3	Ordered pizza Friday night. One large pepperoni (classic hand tossed) and one large thin crust cheese w/ parmesan asiago. Delivery was estimated to be 33-43 min. Love the pizza tracker! The pizza actually arrived early--about 30 min. The delivery guy was friendly. The pizza was good, although I'm not in love with the garlic seasoning on the crust. When they first started it a few years ago, I thought I liked it, but now I think it tastes a little weird.
