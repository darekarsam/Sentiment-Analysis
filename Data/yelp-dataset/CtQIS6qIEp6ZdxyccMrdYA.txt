4	I ordered the house special, which is the special in most houses as the name, "Dac Biet", means "special". Raw beef, with tendon, brisket, flank, tripe, and fatty flank; topped with thinly shaved onions (which cook practically instantly when you flip the noodles and mix the bowl up) and scallions. The soup was incredibly clear but deep in flavor; beefy but not murky. The more I ate, the more I could literally feel the threads on my shirt tightening up to resist the role as host to the smell molecules from attaching themselves.
4	Pho Ngon has some great Pho. Jammed full of ingredients, it is such a filling and great-tasting soup. There was a bit of a wait to be seated as the place was packed. The service was friendly and reasonably quick.
4	Pho is good but the taste is different from visit to visit... But always delicious. One of the better broths in the city. Service is quick and efficient but not friendly. Spring rolls and imperial rolls are bad (almost no filling and not tasty)I like to go there when I am in a rush.... For a good soup or a good plate of mixed grilled meats with rice.
