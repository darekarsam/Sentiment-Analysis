1	Queen City Dog Service (or should I say simply, Jordan Frye) is an absolute fraud.  Not only did he stuff our pets in the garage for more than a day, and left them without food (though he was contracted for two full visits a day), he was also caught on camera stealing several items during his second visit (during which he only went upstairs to steal items, without visiting the still-stranded animals).  As I am currently swearing out a warrant against him, hopefully no one else will be defrauded in the near future, but in the meantime ... STAY AWAY!
1	You EVIL & VILE piece of existence!  An 8 month old puppy died in the most horrid conditions while you took advantage and burglarized her family.  WARNING TO ALL:  PLEASE READ. http://www.wcnc.com/news/local/Dog-walker-faces-new-charges-of-animal-cruelty-170611656.html
