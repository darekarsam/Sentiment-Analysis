3	Oh Jack in the Box, how I missed you whilst I've been on the East coast. I pulled up in my car, told you what I wanted and you delivered it to me at the next window. I inhaled the smell and short drive to my house. I unwrapped you with my mouth watering. I took a bite and realised it didn't taste as good as I remembered. Maybe it was a case of absence makes the heart fonder, but I was disappointed with my sourdough Jack. And that made me sad.
4	I've lived near this Jack in the Box for about 4 years now and I will have to say that the employees here are the most courteous employees I have met.  In this amount if time I have only had maybe 2 or 3 times were they have messed up my order and even then they were very eager to help rectify the problem.
5	This is the only Jack In The Box I will go to now. The customer service is amazing. I don't know what incentives the managers here give out, but they're definitely doing something right. A few months ago I went through the drive-thru late at night after work, and I accidentally drove off without getting my debit card back. I didn't realize until I was leaving for work the next day. I was finally able to go back 24 hours after I left it, and the lady immediately recognized me and ran to get my card and return it to me. She had locked it in a safe in the manager's office so no one could get it. I was amazed and SO thankful that this place employs honest people.
2	As a kid I enjoyed it when I traveled out West, but I have come to realize more and more over the years that the food here is truly disgusting.This was the last location I visited and will probably be my last visit to a Jack in the Box in a long time. Even for fast food I just can't stomach it.
