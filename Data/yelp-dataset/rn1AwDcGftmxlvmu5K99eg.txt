5	Thunderbird is a graduate school of business with students world-famous for being interconnected. Many of these social networks form at the Thunderbird Pub. Whether a student, alumni, or just curious the Thunderbird Pub is a reflection of the open nature of the Thunderbird community. The big night at the pub is Thursday--and things are pretty quiet when school is not in session.
5	The Pub serves as the focal point for all out of classroom gathering.  The building, a historic tower for the airfield from a bygone era, was recently remodeled and is a very modern and clean space.  With both indoor and outdoor seating, it is the perfect place to get together with new friends, enjoy typical bar food, a beer and a game on one of the flat screens.  For those that stay on campus, this is a terrific venue as it ensures a quick commute and plenty of interesting people to talk to.  In this neighborhood, it would be tough to do much better.
5	Local-international gathering spot since the 1940s. One of the coolest pubs on the planet. Make new friends from all over the world, with some of the best regional and imported beer selections in town.
