5	HANDS DOWN FAVORITE DINER! This is the place I go to to get the lengendary Super Boy! It's a double patty burger with onions, mustard, and a huge bun...(maybe tomato comes on it, but I always get it without) and it comes along with great fries. Pair this burger with a vanilla milkshake and you will be all set! I swear this hidden gem is as good as it gets. Its family owned and the people that have worked there have been there since I was a child. Its nice to come in and always see a friendly face :)
5	Hello friends,Call in your order, gets kinda crowded!!! I used to come here often years ago. Also,to the other location on Independence. This location is Dine-In/Pick-Up. Very clean, that may be due to the fact of it being so small on the inside. Small as diners can be, this one packs a punch.  And if you get here at peak lunch time... It pack em in.I've now been twice for lunch. Hot Dogs, fries & Milk Shake. All were good, but honestly it's a hot dog & fries. (How hard it that) I will say the fries were better than standard fries, and the food is always hot & ready in 10 mins usually.I don't usually hand out 5 stars. I do when the service is consistent, the food is consistent, wait time is consistently good, and lastly a fair price. All of which they ball spot on..TTFN
5	Food is crazy good! The fried BBQ chicken is delicious and the French fries are awesome. Fast friendly service sodas are very fizzy and the restaurant is very clean. Try it out you will not be disappointed.
5	Great place to go for a burger and fries! Always courteous and always fast service. If you're in the area stop by.
