4	Okay...so I'm liking the Boston Store. I've NEVER really taken the time to shop here, mostly because 75% of the items here are overpriced. However, I've gotten good at shopping the clearance racks. You can find some great deals if you're willing to take the time to browse. Also, I broke down and got the card, so I get coupons ALL the time. All. The. Time. Like, once a day...maybe it's a bit stalkerish. BUT, the $50 off $100 coupon I got the other day makes the flooded inbox worth it. Bottom line: If you're willing to dig through the racks, and come in with a coupon, you can get great merch for decent prices!
4	While I prefer the layout of the Eastside Boston Store, this location has a good spot mid-mall and has certain things not found elsewhere: a Bobbi Brown counter and a really big handbag selection. Always good service here and competitive pricing.
1	No one to help at all. Best part was the fitting rooms. Not a single one was clean anywhere in the men's department. Seriously look at the picture.
1	This place is so disorganized. Went to exchange some coffee mugs and the lady was so confused. They could not read there own receipt. All I wanted to do is exchange coffee mugs for a different color. Same price. But they claimed there was a $0.03 deference. I paid it just because I wanted to get out of there! I will do all I can to talk my friends and family from shopping here.
4	Being new to Wisconsin I have never heard of Boston Store. I was looking for a Dillards or Nordstrom and Boston store was the most "similar" *cough* near me. I will say the associates have been very loyal to me and have provided me with excellent service. I even receive thank you voicemails from them which shows they truly care about their clientele. Since BS is my only option for higher end shopping, I utilize it as much as possible and take advantage of their rewards programs and credit offers.
