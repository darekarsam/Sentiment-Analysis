4	A cozy haven for bibliophiles. I wandered into City Books on a cloudy Saturday afternoon, and it was practically deserted. Opera music played, and I perused the musty shelves, organized haphazardly by subject. It's a lovely little escape from the craziness of East Carson.
4	This would be the best bookstore in pittsburgh, if it wasn't situated on E. Carson and dimly lit with an awful cat smell. If you can ignore everything I just said, then this bookstore provides the largest, most extensive philosophy selection in the burgh. The other sections are well maintained, but the philosophy section is the largest I've seen in a independent bookstore before.
4	Awesome in the single word! Affordable in the second word! Easy to find out whatever you need  gifting shop also can be said. Actually I love books and also this store like due to the service I have taken from them. Taken different types of books mentioned good.
