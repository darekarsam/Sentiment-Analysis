5	Boarded my dog there and the staff was nothing but extra nice and caring. Price was unbeliveable, and they made sure we knew the dog was in good hands. Good experience.
5	I have been taking my pet cats here for four years.  I have been satisfied with any vet and any assistant that has seen my cats.  They aren't all gushy over my animals, but they do a good job of making them comfortable.  The vets are honest and don't beat around the bush.  Cat's got fleas?  They tell me to take care of it and how.  That's cool with me because I hate to be coddled.  I feel like the prices are fine, although I don't have much to compare them to.  Let's just say I don't feel like I'm being taken advantage of.I do recommend this place.
5	I've been taking my animals there for years. I now live in Chicago but I'm making a trip down to Urbana this weekend for an appointment.
5	We took our elderly dog in for a checkup and were very satisfied with the care, treatment and advice we received.  The Dr. was very sympathetic with our concerns and needs.   Very professional and caring people and charges seemed appropriate.
