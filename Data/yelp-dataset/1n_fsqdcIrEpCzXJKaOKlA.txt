4	Very friendly staff, super cheap laptops, televisions and $1-3 dollar DVD's, if you want your bang for your buck!
5	Because I am familiar with this area I was very happy to find a pawn shop to sell some jewelry to.  They were very busy when I came into the shop, but all 3 people working acknowledged that I was there.  The 3rd person actually called a 4th person out to help me.  The person that helped me was no less than  the Assistant Store Manager Tyler.  I also want to say that Vicki, Jenna and Ernest were very pleasant, helpful and answered any question I had.I had brought in quite a chuck of jewelry so it took a little time.  So people lets be realistic, I brought in the jewelry to sell to pay for a divorce.  When you go into a pawn shop try to remember they are NOT going to pay retail prices like you did!!!I went in with an amount I felt I needed to file and got more than expected.  It was great I would use this store again if necessary.
