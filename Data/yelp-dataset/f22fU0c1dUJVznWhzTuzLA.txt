3	my rating is unknown because i haven't been to the place yet but i thought i should add the business hours for the Goodyear location, Mon-Fri 8 to 5 closed for lunch from 12 till 1
3	Let me just start by saying the staff is as a whole super friendly. I came 20 minutes prior to my appointment and had to wait about 20 minutes past my appointment to finally be seen. I had Dr. Valerie Huls, I had seen her picture, she was pretty and I bet super sweet....WRONG. Boy can looks be deceiving. She was quick, sharp, rude, and the list goes on. She didn't ask, "Hey can I look down your shirt and at your back for acne?" She just did it without even saying a word leaving me totally clueless. She didn't explain my medicine, didn't answer my questions (this was because she was so rushed she didn't give me time to ask them), and she had a hateful look on her face the whole time. I have never had a doctor who was so rude and looked so miserable. I would recommend seeing a different doctor there as they all seemed happy and smiled. As for Dr.Huls she should head back to school to learn bedside manners.
5	Wow, dr. Valerie huls was incredibly nice and attentive.  She answered every question,  listened to everything I said,  and thoroughly discussed the information. On average you wait 3-6 months to see a dermatologist in my experience and Dr.Huls was worth the wait. She even ran out my care instructions to my car that I had forgotten. I would recommend making an appointment with her. I was scheduled at 1040 am and taken back at 1042 am, that's impressive for any doctors office. All the staff was friendly and sweet and the office is well kept and clean. Great experience.
