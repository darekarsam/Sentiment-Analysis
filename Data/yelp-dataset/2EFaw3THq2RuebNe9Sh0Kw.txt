1	Had the store manager pack and ship a package for me, and even bought insurance at his suggestion. But when the package arrived damaged, the owner gave me the run around after days of haggling on the phone.  Don't use these guys if you care about your packages.
3	UPDATED: This place has improved. They are now more responsive and helpful. I appreciate that.Not interested in helping you.  I had a valuable shipment of art work refused by this place because it came by freight.  They didn't even call me. They are not responsive. They are not customer focused. There are better choices.  If you need something valuable delivered don't send it here
5	Have greatly enjoyed using your services from the mailbox to notary to copies and beyond.  You guys get it done and very efficiently.  I have appreciated your help on many occasions and will let others know you guys do a great job!
5	I have used this locations on several occasions and have always had a good experience.
