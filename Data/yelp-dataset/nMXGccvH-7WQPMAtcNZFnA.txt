5	I just stopped by to get my oil change and I was very surprise with the Manager and the staff at this Jiffy Lube location. They work well and fast.  I definitely recommend them. Keep up the good work
1	Beware if this location. These guys here are lazy.  They were nice enough to say it was OK for me to show up right at closing.  To tell me a few minutes later that there was a crack in my radiator and fluid was dripping (...it was brand new radiator fluid dripping out) and that due to liability issues were unable to work on my van.  I took my van to my mechanic and not a single thing was found to be wrong.  Wish I could give this location a zero!  I will never recommend this place to anyone
1	The integrity of the service here failed my expectations. I just changed my windshield wipers last month and the technicians suggested I change the wipers because they looked "cracked." I now question the proper services I'm truly receiving and no longer trust the Jiffy Lube Corporation.
