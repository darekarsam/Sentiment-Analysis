5	I've  enjoyed getting my hair done at Hairadize for a year or so now.    The staff is professional the setting is wonderful, clean, new... There's even a kids room.... I have yet to wait more than 5 minutes in the waiting room.  The last time I has there the stylist took time to show how to wet set my hair at home.     Although the clientele is largely African American I've also seen happycustomers  of other ethnicities enjoying the services as well.  Something I haven't seen at other black salons.  Recently they added a nail technician to the staff.  She is awesome, no worries about hygiene the tubs are flushed the full 15 minutes without you having to insist!  This is a first for me!    Although I live in Mesa I will continue to make the drive.  Peace out!
5	The Best, classy, clean and proffesional hair salon in the valley.  This salon hasmultiple services we can choose from, such as hair, nails, facials, it even has a tattoo room!@ Kid area that is great to keep the kiddos busy while your relaxing while getting pampered.   All first time clients get a free trim.  All ethnicities go here which creats a comfortable multicultural enviroment . 10 thumbs up! Absoulutley no disappointments here ,this salon  promotes healthy hair.
1	Expensive as heIl. There are cheaper places for people  to get their hair done here in AZ. This b@*%# is just BROKE and has very little clients so she has to OVERCHARGE the few people that actually do go to her. RACHET mother who doesn't care about your hair and that just wants to take your money. She is going to go out of business very soon and it will be all her fault! I won't even feel bad for her. What a shame! Don't recommend this place unless you are careless about your money. Won't be going back!
