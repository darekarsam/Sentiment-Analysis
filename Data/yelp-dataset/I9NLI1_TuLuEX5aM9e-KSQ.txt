4	Boudiche stock the kind of sumptuous looking under garments of gorgeousness that make you want to up your daily sit-ups, so you can slink around looking like Scarlett Johansson or someone equally as hot and film star-esque. The shop itself is all silky and luxurious looking, with soft, purple shaded curtains in the changing room, and big robes to wear while you're trying things on, so you kind of feel like you're slouching around the bedroom of some kind of boutique hotel. Boudiche sell the brilliant Bebaroque range of tights and bodies, which I absolutely love. They include various hot designs, comprising of sequins, tattoo prints and other delectable patterns. They also stock designers such as Christian Lacroix, well known lingerie brand La Perla, and Stella McCartney. My personal lingerie favourites were the Stella McCartney days of the week underwear, that come in what look like little drawer compartments. Definitely my ideal purchase, as I do have trouble on the odd occasion remembering what day it is.
