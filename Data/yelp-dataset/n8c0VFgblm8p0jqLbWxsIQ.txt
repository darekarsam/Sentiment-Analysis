5	I have had mediocre pest service in the past and have gone years without. I called T2 on a personal recommendation from another pest control service that does not do my area but whom I trust. The initial phone consultation went very well and I was very optimistic. Terrell called to say he could come early and if that was alright. I had a tick problem and scheduled every two weeks and then three and now we are doing maintenance. Every time T2 is prompt and on time. He knows my schedule and is very respectful of that. I feel like he really cares about my family and pets and keeping us safe. I would highly recommend T2.
5	Great pest control company! They're always on time and I've had the same guy spraying my house for years now.
