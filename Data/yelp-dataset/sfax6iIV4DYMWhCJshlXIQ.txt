4	I've been getting coffee here since they opened years ago. Same employees all of these years, even though its in Safeway- that's pretty cool. Coffee is standard, prices are high. $10 for 2 grande mochas. Only Starbucks... :/
3	Convenient location. It's right across the street from where I work, so when I'm in need of caffeine I come here. Staff has always been pleasant.
2	Plan about 15 minutes for your drink since they only staff with one worker. I've been in enough times to find it's the norm.
2	Not my favorite Starbucks, poor customer service and they would only give us one gift card even though we bought two k-cup packs. Will go to the Safeway location next time.
