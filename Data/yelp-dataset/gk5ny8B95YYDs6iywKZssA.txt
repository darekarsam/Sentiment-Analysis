5	They were here in less than 24 hours an finished putting 2 new springs up within 15 min.. well done Tyson...
5	When we had a broken spring we used ADS. When my door was super slow opening and closing we used ADS. Every time they have come out fast and completed the job efficiently and for a very fair price. They were easy to work with and arrived on time. I have recommended them to many friends because I have was happy with their service. Definitely who I will call the next time I need my garage door fixed.
5	We've used ADS Garage Doors for the second time and if we ever have another garage door problem, we'll definitely call them first.  Shane Bunce quickly responds, corrects the problem at a reasonable cost, and cleans up when he is finished.  He does quality work and is mighty efficient.  We had a broken spring Saturday night at a rental property.  I called Shane and today, Sunday, it was fixed.  We have a very happy tenant...and we are very happy owners.  Truly outstanding in every way ( I don't say that about many people).  I'll recommend ADS to any of my friends who need garage door repairs or replacement.  Thanks, Shane -- job well done!
