2	The location on Eastway has sub par customer service and the security guard is always weird acting and staring you down. I feel like it's too much.
1	This is the worst Food Lion I have been to. Unfortunately it is very close to my home so from now on I will have to go out of my way to do my grocery shopping. What makes this the worst? Well its the food. It is about every other shopping trip I end up with something expired or spoiled. Now the customer service is okay, and they have always given me my money back or an exchange. But the final straw was when I purchased breakfast sausage this past Sunday. I opened the package and started to form the first patty when the most foul smell took over my kitchen. It was so bad I almost got sick. This was not expired. It was so bad I could not take it back to the store. Customer service did give me my money back. Unfortunately with this not being the first time, in fact it is about every other time, I am having to go back and explain the food is rotten or expired. That breakfast sausage experience really traumatized me. I am glad they appologized but they need to just fix the issue. And yes, I got my money back, but I really felt like they should have done more. Now I am going out of my way to do my shopping. Boo Food Lion on Eastway drive.
5	I found the other 2 reviews a bit odd.  Being I've just moved to the area it is the grocery store closest to me.I actually have found my weekly trips there quite pleasant.   They  sale groceries!  They are reasonably priced and the staff is always friendly.   I actually like that this store is just simply a grocery store.I haven't had to take anything back as I actually look at what I'm buying.  I make sure that things aren't expired and have the produce just as fresh as any other grocery including ones that cost much more.Fortunately I don't need a triple frapa-latte to enhance my shopping experience.  I just go there to buy food for my family!
