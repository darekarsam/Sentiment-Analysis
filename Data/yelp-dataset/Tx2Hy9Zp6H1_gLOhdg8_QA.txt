2	We were walking around the place, with tons of pricey food trucks and decided we'd rather come inside for a meal...It's bistro food, more like a tourist trap place. The service is friendly and the food is average. We ordered the fried calamari, which is always a safe choice, and it was good. You know when you see I ordered fried calamari in my reviews, it's because there is nothing else special on the menu ;) and you can rarely go wrong with fried calamari.For the main, I ordered the duck confit, which was dry and came with some berry sauce, it was sweet and weird. I did not like it too much. We did split a bottle of wine 3ways for about 40$ which is a good deal.
2	Tourist trap! Superb location and nice settings. Food is barely OK, and service is very amateur. The tartare had been "proceed" to finely, a long time ago. There are now good alternative around there. OK for a drink outdoors and the fried calamari is decent. Walk a block around for your meal.
