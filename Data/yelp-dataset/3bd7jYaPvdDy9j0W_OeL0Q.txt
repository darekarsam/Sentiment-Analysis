5	Good Day Pest control has been servicing our homes for 10 years or more. Jason came to our house monthly and he always call ahead to confirm his service appointment sine the beginning of his service.  We have been bug free for many many years. My kids are 16 years old and 13 years old now and they had no reaction of Good Day Pest Control spray at all.  I really recommend Good Day Pest Control guy!!  My family really appreciates Jason's service from the bottom of our hearts.
5	Could not ask for a better pest control program with Jason, calls every month, comes the day after, comes out if I happen to see a random bug and freak out (I hate bugs), great price and overall just an awesome friendly friendly person. And we have two little babies now 2 and 3 years old and it is completely safe for them as well.
5	Jason was recommended to me by a friend when I became a homeowner and he is the best. Super friendly, and trustworthy, ALWAYS calls ahead to confirm your appointment and always worked with my schedule if I needed him to come in the house to spray every few months. Never saw any bugs in the house and if I did they had clearly gotten to the spray. I continually refer him to friends and family.
