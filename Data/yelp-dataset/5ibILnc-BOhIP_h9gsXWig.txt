5	Sensei Hiroshi is an excellent teacher. His classes are a well oiled machine, where the children learn self control and the proper form of Karate. I was amazed on how behaved and how well they listened to his instruction, aiding to the flow of the class. There is not a wasted moment because of the level of discipline these children have.Hiroshi himself is very educated and very gracious, always wanting to improve and to excel. If you live in the area this is the place to go.
5	Hiroshi karate is a great experience for our child.  We are very happy with it.  Our child is 6 years old, and he is learning very important lessons not only of karate but of life.  I have also been able to see Hiroshi's dedication to the sport from a different angle.  I volunteered as a physician for the international tournament held annually in Las Vegas, and saw his classes of boys and girls  of all ages compete so well in karate. Hiroshi takes so much interest and dedication.  We are grateful for him.
5	Sensei Hiroshi has always been there for my training since I was a kid. He was a champion of his time and has inspired me to become the best I can be. He is very personable with his students and he is always keen on teaching good karate to his students. I have trained with him for almost a decade now, since then I have won many national and international tittles in karate and I continue to compete under his supervision. Because of his inspiration and dedication to me, I have my own dojo and he has motivated me to teach karate as a career. He even test my students and we are honored to have him. You will never find a teacher like him and that's for damn sure. Become a champion, join Hiro Karate! Thank you Sensei for everything you taught me. Jojo
