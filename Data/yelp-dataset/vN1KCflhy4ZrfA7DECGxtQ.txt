3	Probably the best place in Union South to get your lunch fixin's.  They seem to have recently contracted with Batch Bakehouse to supply them with bread, and it is all so good now!  Their Cuban and El Paso sandwiches are solid, and their specials that they bake in their fire oven are fantastic, but take nearly 10 minutes to prepare.Skip the mac and cheese (made with suuuuper goopy fake-cheese?!) and potatoes (soggy?!), and go straight for the apples for your side.
3	The only place to get a salad at Union South. They also have a pretty extensive selection of sandwiches if that is more your thing. I've only ever ordered the salads there, but I've definitely been tempted to try some of the sandwiches, in particular the banh mi sandwich! :9Each salad comes with a Batch Bakehouse roll, which is pretty sweet! Actually, the partnership itself with Batch Bakehouse is pretty freaking awesome. You also have the option of adding chicken to any of the salads for an additional $2. TOTALLY worth it, if you ask me. For $2, you get a full chicken breast sliced over your salad instead of just a couple of strips. Tip: I've noticed that you get more bang for your buck if you order 'for here' instead of 'to go', which probably has something to do with the size of the plate (huge! and without a lid!) versus the size of the take-out container (smaller! with a lid!). So, if you are extra hungry and have some extra time, I'd suggest you ordering your salad (with added chicken) 'for here'! :)
