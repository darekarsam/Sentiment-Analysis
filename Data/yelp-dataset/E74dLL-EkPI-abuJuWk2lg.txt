3	I walk by Dulcinea Bakeshop every morning on my way to work, and I never go in because I've already gone to Colangelo's Bakery on 21st (which remains my favorite bake shop in Pgh).Today I thought I'd stop in and get a croissant, why not, I'm passing it anyway.It's not exactly a fest for the eyes inside.  the baked goods are just kind of in a case but not displayed in a way that is food porn and makes me want to try everything.  I'll admit I was a little disappointed, but this is a newer business so maybe they are working that out.I ordered a croissant and it was $2.25 but it was tiny.  Very good, but it was tiny.  I will still def be back bc they offer a variety of savory baked goods which are my favorite, in addition to the traditional cookies, cakes, etc.
5	I am a foodie and try to eat mostly organic / natural foods.The first thing I tried was Tabrina's veggie quiche - the best I have had in my life!!  Flakey buttery crust... So savory and delicious - just the right amount of everything.  So now I go to Dulcinea every chance I get - 1-2 times a week.It is evident that she uses uncommercial fresh ingredients.  Nothing like the big bakeries around town.  The location is on Penn Ave in the strip and Tabrina - is a young, hip, savvy, and sweet owner.   She takes a simple approach but then puts a edgy flair into her food to the likes that you have never tasted before.  She takes pride in her work and values her customers...very rare nowadays. I definitely recommend giving her a try. You'll go back I promise!
