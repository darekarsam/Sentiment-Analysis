3	Hehehe, Gas Station... Its the same as the rest of them,
4	Nice place and friendly staff... I'm new to yelp but a long time regular here... They are always ready for me when I come in and most of them already know what I want.The only downfall here is they tend to run out of my favorite drinks once every 6 weeks and it takes a week or two for them to restock it.
3	Been to one gas station, been to em all. This one never stocks the silver red bull. Minus 2 stars.
1	Love the Asian cashier. So nice. However, the middle-aged white guy is just stupid. He didn't know how to scan my Smiths card from my phone (EVERYONE ELSE, including the new lady) knows how. So, he refused it. I live down the road. Have been a regular for 6 years. Enough with this one guy though!  He's ALWAYS rude. Never smiles.
1	And yet again the same cashier, middle-aged guy with light brown hair plays stupid with me. "I can't do split payments."  Dude, you've been at this store for 13 years. I know because I've complained before. You're rude. Unprofessional. Not worthy of my business.
