1	Currently still waiting for my food. It's over 30 minutes late and I ordered 1.5 hours ago.
1	Ordered from here and was given an over an hour window for delivery. While this was a little longer than we hoped, it was acceptable. Our order was over an hour late, we waited over 2 hours for our food and were not granted any discount or recompense of any sort. Our food was cold and we didn't get an apology for the tardiness, rather several excuses. Less than stellar experience on this simple order.
