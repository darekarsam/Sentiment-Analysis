2	My experience here was ok. I am new to town and wanted to get my nails done on a holiday, fortunately they were open. However, like most nails shops like this they were trying to do too much at once. The gentleman who did my nails had no conversation for me, not sure if it was because he was so busy watching what everyone else was doing or because he was tending to his, approximately, 10 year old son. Either way I'm still on the hunt for a regular salon and would probably only go here in an emergency.
4	I've been going here since I moved to Charlotte 15 years ago.  I stopped a few years ago since it changed management but have been a regular since 2008.  They treat me like VIP.  I usually bring my own wine & get the full treatment. I always schedule appointments so I can get Lindsay or Katie. They are the BEST!!!  I don't let anyone else touch my nails & I can usually go 3 weeks before I need to revisit.
4	I called them last night to try and squeeze in a pedicure.  It was very last minute on a busy Saturday night, and they were able to!  The pedicure wasn't rushed and the woman who helped me did a wonderful job!  I have gel nails and I've gone to a different nail salon every time in search of MY salon, and I'm excited to try the gel nails at Op Nails this week!  Very pleased.  The inside is nicely decorated, and it doesn't smell like acrylic, like most nail salons do!
