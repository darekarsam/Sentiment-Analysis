4	This was the first time I had ever boarded my dogs and they were happy and healthy when I picked them up. The owners were receptive to my daily update calls and went into detail about how my dogs were behaving, eating and taking medications. Their rates are good and they do not charge extra for giving oral medications. I will definitely use this business again.

To me, that's the sign of a good kennel.They are good about giving medications if needed.The only reason I did not give 5 stars is they only accept cash for payment.I miss getting those airline miles on my credit card.
5	We left our dogs here over a weeks vacation and they did a wonderful job caring for our two dogs. When we picked them up, they were clean and happy. Very reasonably-priced.
