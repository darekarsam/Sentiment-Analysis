5	Absolutely perfect!  Our guests were raving about the food!  I worked with Maggie for our reception and I couldn't be happier.  She was so incredibly helpful and make me feel so at ease.  She accommodated for kids' meals and multiple food allergies.  She even had one specific meal made for one guest with multiple allergies.  She just went above and beyond what we expected and the food was awesome on top of it.Don't forget to bring 2 friends to the tasting!  You'll all be rolling out of there stuffed tot he brim.
1	9 of us met for dinner. The food was good but nothing special. When we got our bills we each were charged a $10 "service fee". Waiter was not clear in explaining the fee. Some of us tipped on top of it due to the confusion. When one of the party called later to get an explanation of the fee, she was given 3 different stories. Tom agreed to call back with explanation but he never called back. Poor service!  9 of us won't be back because of this.
5	Common Plea catered our wedding/brunch reception and they were a dream to work with. I got to work with Martin, who was just the nicest, most gracious person in the world and handled all my requests. He had wonderful suggestions to make our menu well-balanced and appealing for all kinds of tastes. Guests loved the food and Martin made sure our day was perfect.
