5	Forget those hour frame shops or craft stores if you want a quality frame job this place is hands down the best.  The gentleman inside is quite a character and makes you feel like family.  If you come in at the right time you may even catch him playing guitar!  But what really sets it off is the selection of frames!  He can do anything from your basic frame to fantastic shadow boxes!  The prices are reasonable and tho you may have to wait to pick up your painting it is well worth it!  If you want a quality job with a beautiful look then visit the frame gallery.
5	This place is wonderful. My favorite framing place recently closed so I was on the hunt for a quality framer. I found that and more here. I came in to get a degree framed and the owner was exceedingly kind and helpful. He spent over 30 minutes working with me on choosing the best framing option. The price was great and the work was completed ahead of schedule in about 3 days. I would highly recommend this framer for your framing needs
5	Fantastic service, great selection of frames and completely open and honest about pricing. The owner helped me track down the perfect frame for my budget. Would highly recommend trying this spot out for all of your professional framing needs.
