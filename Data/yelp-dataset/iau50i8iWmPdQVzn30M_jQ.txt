3	I enjoyed these courts very much so, and for being a pay by the hour set...  I was happy with the reasonable rates... The one thing I didnt enjoy was the not so friendly cashier in the club house who advised us without saying anything that we were interrupting his personal conversation.  i realize that the place was dead and you probably wanted to go home... but you are on the clock... and customers are in front of you.  Put on a fake smile AT LEAST and build a solid rapport with the customer..   Thank you.  Otherwise, spot on time.... lovely court quality.
5	The center, the instructors, and the players here motivate me to keep practicing TENNIS!  It's a great community whether you are a beginner or a more advanced player.  The instructors, Peter, Marco and John are very supportive and are quite the characters on the court (that's a compliment).  They make learning FUN and funny.  Make sure to ask about their 30/30 special.  For $30 you can attend as many tennis classes for 30 days.  You will be hooked!
5	Beautiful Tennis facility is part of the Charlie Kellogg and Joe Zaher Sports Complex.
5	Just started the Adult group beginner classes $30 for 30 program.  I am so thrilled to have such a fantastic facility close to where I live.  Court rentals are reasonable and so are lessons group or private.  Friendly staff and members.  You will find all levels of players and teams, groups.  Something for everyone.  If you have kids, it's a great sport to get them involved in.  If you want to exercise/lose weight, it's a fun activity to incorporate into an overall fitness regimen.  You will make friends and connections.  Wish my nieces lived here, would love to get them started early.  One of the great things about living in Vegas for me.
