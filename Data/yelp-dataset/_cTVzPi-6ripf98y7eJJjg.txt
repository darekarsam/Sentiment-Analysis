4	On time service, fine work.The guy came on time, was very good and fast.The only problem I found was that 1 room = 200 sq. ft. I feel this is too small for 1 room.Anyways, apart from this, it was a very good service, liked it and would recommend it to anyone who needs good, prompt work without caring for the price much.PS: 1st experience, hence no much idea about the prices.
5	it was an emergency. Oily stain that I didn't want to set on my carpet. Van was here in less than an hour and cleaned all around the living room. Would recommend
1	DO NOT HIRE THIS CLEANER OR BELIEVE THE REVIEWS! Terrible, terrible, terrible! I needed someone to clean carpets in my apartment. I told them it was on the third floor. When they arrived, they told me they couldn't do it because they only had a hose connected to their truck and it wouldn't reach my apartment. The man and owner, Van Vu, was extremely rude and mean. I later reported them to the Better Business Bureau and was told that they constantly get complaints about them. Again, do not believe the reviews or trust them. Van and Beck Vu will lie to you over the phone to get your business. DO NOT USE THEM! THEY ARE CROOKS!!!
