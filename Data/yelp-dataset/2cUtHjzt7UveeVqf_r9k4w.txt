5	Tom and Debe are both amazing at what they do.  Tom has been cutting my hair for going on 25 years and he's one of the ONLY people who can get my hair right and he does so consistently.  Debe has done my daughter's hair since she was a wee one.  She is a wonder with hair color!  Plus, they are some of the truly nicest folk you'll ever want to meet.  I highly recommend Love You Hair!
5	Tom and Debbie are amazing at what they do! I get the best color jobs from Debbie and Tom, well I can't imagine EVER going to anyone else. They are very welcoming and friendly and not overpriced either.
5	Tom and Debe take care of their customers. Salon has a great atmosphere.  Love this place and love my hair. You can't go wrong!
