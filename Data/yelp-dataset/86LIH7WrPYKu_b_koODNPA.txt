5	I am so excited that Sephora is now located in Downtown Summerlin!  I attended my first VIB Rouge event in November and I felt like a princess!  Employees greeted me, did a free makeover, helped me shop as if I were the only one in the store!  They were slammed for the event!  Wendy, Destiny, Moriah, Carol, Toni are just to name a few!  They are always giving me free samples and advice on skincare!  Thank you so much for all of my makeovers and customer service that is beyond the call of duty!
