1	Came across this new car wash and thought I would give it a try. Went to pay with my credit card and was told "debit only" I then pointed out the door advertises credit cards accepted. I said I had to pay by credit card. I then said to stop the car wash. The lady behind the desk then said sorry the charge went through. I then questioned why I was told debit only. She then said it was because of the credit card fee. The owner then came out and asked what was going on. I told him it was a bunch of hookey that he was telling customers no credit card. I did get my car washed. I tried to write up a yelp review butit did not exist, so I created a location. Yelp like to have a picture of the business, so I went over to take a picture. The owner came over to look at my car and then took a picture of my license plate. I at the time was taking a picture of my receipt for my expense report. He saw me doing this and then flipped out, asking me I thought I was doing. I explained it was for an expense report and he wouldn't believe me. He then said he would give me my money back and that he took a picture of my license plate. Not sure what he plans on doi g with that. LOL!! I did not take my money back. I tipped the guys who detailed my car and left. The employees did a great job o. My car, but because of the owner, I will not go back.
