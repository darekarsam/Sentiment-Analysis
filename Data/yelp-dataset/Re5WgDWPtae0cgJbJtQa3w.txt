5	For our 20th Wedding Anniversary, my husband and I had a 3D image of ourselves made inside a crystal and it was exceptional. The service was so incredibly fast. Only took 20 minutes to take the picture of us and walk away with our photo permanently enshrined in a crystal. Staff was great and the price was also less than I thought it would be. I'm very satisfied.
5	I have seen these several times but this time I stopped at the shop in the Excaliber. It is amazing how they can take picturres from your phone or pc and create a breathtaking memory. I ended up ordering 2 on the spot and ordered a 3rd by on line site when I got home. The staff is super friendly and knowledgable and Tim acutally helped picked out a better picture. Ordered it Tues. , got it Weds. and gave them to my sons on Sunday. Un-believable.
1	We were walking through New York, New York when we came upon Cashman Crystal. Very displeased with results and service.  I was in Vegas for a conference, my husband was traveling with me, and he thought this would be a nice item to celebrate our wedding from earlier this year.  The pictures I had were on facebook and I asked if resolution would be a problem.  I was told no.  When we picked up the item, our picture is very grainy compared to those on display and our faces our very dark (we are both very fair).  The response of the gentleman there was "well those pictures were taken here on site, they should have told you there would be a difference".  He was the one I had asked about the resolution!  If we were providing a picture that was not going to turn out well, we should have been give some guidance on that, and gotten better service.  I am extremely disappointed.  We had even spent extra to get a base with changing colors.  I would not recommend this vendor, waste of money.
