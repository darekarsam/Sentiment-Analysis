2	Austin Yelper here... I was in Charlotte on business a few weeks back and was taken to Town for a nice dinner.  We stayed in the lounge area for about an hour near the bar, and had some pretty good wine.  The atmosphere was nice and the bartender was friendly.  After everyone arrived, we sat down... and it went quickly downhill.  I ordered a filet, medium rare, and kept making conversation.  The company was nice, so time flew by!  In fact, 2.5 hours flew by.  No food.  Finally, we realized that and complained... and our food came out pretty quickly afterwards... stone cold.  I hate sending food back, I really do... but for the amount of money that it cost and the fact that we waited a few hours for the food, I sent it back.  A few minutes later, they delivered the wrong entree to me, piping hot.  So, that went back as well.  The next steak that came out was extremely rare.  I'm pretty sure that the waiter went back and asked for my steak to be thrown on the grill for a few seconds, to be rushed out to me.  Since I was with clients and colleagues, and didn't want to make a scene, I ate the steak.  Boy... that was my biggest mistake of the night, because the next morning, I was sicker than I'd been in a long time.  Halfway across the country, trying to maintain composure in my meeting the next morning... let's just say that I was very glad to be getting on a plane to come home later that day!It gets two stars for the excellent bar service and atmosphere.  The food and waiter service gets a big 0.
3	i was in charlotte for a week on business. my charlotte based counterpart took me to town for lunch.i had a kobe burger with fries for 10.50. the burger bun reminded me of chibatta bread, but it wasn't bad.the fries were good, and i had enough of them to the point that i didn't finish them all.
