5	The best in the west we looked high and low for a place to settled down in Mesh .AZ. after months of looking Trails at Harris has it all Hot tub 34hrs work out room and low rent.
3	I've lived here for about a year now and just signed a lease for another year. This place isn't terrific, but it's not bad either. You could certainly do a lot worse than this, especially if you are using subsidized housing (they accept most government housing subsidies.) The staff is friendly and helpful and there are some pretty decent amenities: a gym room with some exercise equipment, a small playground, a couple of pools and a clubhouse that you can use if your kid has a birthday party or something. If you don't have a car it's a good location because it's near a bus line (the 61) and there's also a Wal-Mart, a Fry's and many good restaurants within walking distance. The neighborhood seems pretty safe; in fact, we're just a stone's throw away from Gilbert here, which is consistently ranked one of the safest cities in America. That was a major selling point for me, since that last place I lived was very dangerous.
1	I do not like this apartment complex for various reasons...the a/c unit went out the first month my BF was in this place, the toilets dont flush correctly, it is loud as hell all the time, and someone hit the back of our truck and of course didnt leave a note :/
