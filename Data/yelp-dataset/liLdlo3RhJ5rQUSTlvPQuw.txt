5	I LOVE this church! It's extremely laid-back and casual, and the pastor is hilarious!
5	I've been going to Rockpoint church for two years and I've struggled in relationships but Pastor Bill has been able to relate to the Bible he always speaks with so much conviction and truth and knowledge I look forward to going to this church every Sunday
5	If you've never been to a church before, or if you're looking for a church with a very welcoming atmostphere then you should definitely come visit! I came here on Thanksgiving weekend from out of state to visit my family and wanted to find a church to go to on that Sunday. I happened across this place on Yelp and after watching just one of the sermons online I KNEW I had to visit this place! The worship team is amazing and the pastor is phenomenal! Even my mother, who came from a very classic and structured backround when it comes to church, enjoyed it as well. The pastor has a great way of taking the teachings of the bible and making them accessible and entertaining. He brings a good balance. Looking forward to the next time that I'm in town so I can visit again! If you don't get the chance to go, I highly recommend checking out the sermons on the website.
5	We love RPC!! We have been here for nine years and just love Pastor Bill's sermons and the worship here! Our son loves the Children's ministry and we are so happy to be a part of the RPC community!
