4	There's always one thing that gets me back there all the time. The smoke meat! And I like mine on their smoke meat poutine.
1	Went here for lunch. Really slow service. People who sat down after us got served as well as got their food before us. My burger wasn't cooked well and tasted awful. When I told them it didn't taste great, they didn't take it back and didn't offer to remove it from the bill. Fries were cold as well. Overpaid for a lunch that made me sick. Won't be going back
