5	When the temp reached 116 this August, my air conditioner died.  I have a home warrantee and they sent out a repair guy two days later!  He looked at my air conditioner and refused the job.  I had to call the warrantee company back and they were going to make me wait another 2 days!  I protested and somehow they found Sysko and Frank worked me into his schedule later that day.  He did an excellent job and shows that cares by working late and through the heat of the day to get the job done.  I really appreciate the excellent job he did and great customer service he provided.  Thank you Sysko Services!
5	We finally found our HVAC guy!! One of our tenants called this summer to let us know that the AC had "come to a screeching halt." That's not the greatest call from a tenant-- especially when it's supposed to be 116F that afternoon. We spent 6 hours calling several of our regular guys to no avail. Many of them left us hanging for hours while they searched for techs who could stop by to look at the system. At about 4:30, we came to the realization that many of the businesses would soon be closing. We hopped onto Yelp and found Syscko Services. He was just finishing up a job and would be passing by the property on the way to the next job, so he actually stopped by. It was nothing more than a capacitor, so he was able to immediately changed that out and for a great price. Now that things are cooling down, we had him over to check our AC units in our home. We have several homes the the valley and will certainly call him for all our HVAC needs. He's dependable, professional, punctual, and we simply trust him. We feel so fortunate to have found him and will certainly be recommending him to all of our family, friends, and clients. Thank you, Frank!
