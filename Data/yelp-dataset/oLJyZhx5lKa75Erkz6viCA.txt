1	Treated my car to a car wash for the first time (I usually hand wash it) but I won't be back!  Yes, it's cheap and quick but the supervisor sprayed my red car with some white cleaner and it stained my car!  The bonnet had white spray splash marks which wouldn't come off, it had discoloured the paint finish.  As I was sat in the car when it was getting cleaned and just drove off after, I hadn't noticed the damage until I got home.  The were closed by the time I called, so I drove there in the morning to see what they could do.Initially they acted ver defensive, said the marks were nothing to do with them and that their cleaner wouldn't cause the damage. They eventually agreed to put the car through the car wash again, free of charge, but the stains were still there after.  They argued it appeared better, but I was still not happy with the results and will not return or trust their car wash again.  If you love your car, as I do, be kind to it and hand wash or spend a little extra and get it cleaned professionally elsewhere.
