4	This is take out only.  They have at least two locations that I am aware of.  One in Sun Prairie and one in Fitchburg.  They have excellent Chinese food and the prices are pretty good.
5	Best chinese I've found so far. Hot and sour soup and their won ton soup are fantastic. Sometimes I'll go and just get the soup.
4	I haven't had better Crab Rangoon than they serve here.  The people who work there are pretty nice, too.
5	The general tso's and boneless spare ribs are about as good as you'll find. No lie!
2	Meh. It's okay when you want something quick. Not overly impressed. Fried rice is good.
2	Pretty bland for Chinese take out.
2	We used to go here for our Americanized Chinese food every so often for the last 7 years.  However, in the last year the quality of their food has taken a nose dive to unacceptable levels of blech and blah.
1	The rice and steamed vegetables were good, but that's about all we could tolerate. We ordered General Tso's, which is what we always get when we first try a Chinese restaurant. It helps us compare to other places.The quality of the chicken used was awful. The dumplings were flavorless. We will not be returning.
3	Chang Jiang is our go-to Chinese take-out place in Sun Prairie. It's not the most amazing Chinese food I've ever had but it definitely satisfies a craving.We like getting their chicken lo mein - spicy and the curry chicken with mixed vegetables added. No complaints!
1	I tried the Cottage Grove location as it was closest to where we live when we first moved to Madison.  Just tried Sun Prairie after a period of a couple years.  Had avoided regularly based on first experience.  Same.  Consistently mediocre, bordering on bad Chinese food.  Both Cottage Grove and Sun Prairie consistent over span of years.  Don't bother.
