5	Have only used this service once and it was great. Professional and prompt. I will use them again
5	We used AZ Skins for a party we hosted at our home. They transported guests to and from our home for us. They were on time and everything went smoothly and our guests had an amazing time. Would definitely recommend this service, we had a great experience. Thank you AZ Skins!
5	These folks provided me a fantastic service in Anthem/Phoenix area with a well maintained fleet and excellent customer service to boot. I traveled frequently back east with a small but established provider that catered to my needs, which could be sporadic at times. I feared dealing with the national car rental industry as there is no personal touch which brings clients back again and again. I didn't think living this far north from metro Phoenix, I would find a reliable and engaging firm as I have found with Anthem Shuttle. Art and Co. managed my account skillfully and I look forward to acquiring their services for future travel plans. Gracias!
5	Jerry was on time, friendly & drove us safely to the airport. We had a great conversation on the way & Im looking forward to using their affordable service next time.
5	We were picked up on time at the airport & Art remembered our car seat :) What friendly & affordable car service. The price couldn't have been better & it was super easy to schedule. Thanks again.
