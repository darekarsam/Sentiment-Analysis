5	Renewed faith in port of subs. Its delicious. Fresh meat and veggies. Reasonably priced. Huge Brownies and cookies. They added panninis to the menu as well.
3	Port of Subs franchise seems to have gone a little downhill on their sandwiches. Not sure if they are buying different meats or just starting to slim down on the amount they put on. The problem is just like bars and pizza joints in this town. They are around every corner. So unless you have a superb sandwich on the cheap then you are not going to win over the masses.
5	This Port of Subs service was outstanding. I went there the very next day. They are the best!!!!
5	Great subs, friendly staff.  Was in town and ended up coming here a few days in a row because it was the best/healthiest option around.
5	Best Subway shop in town!Good service, fresh ingredients and great ambiance.We try nit to buy in any Subway shop but this one is so good we frequent it.
