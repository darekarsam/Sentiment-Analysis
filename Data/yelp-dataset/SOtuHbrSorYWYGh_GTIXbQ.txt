4	Best deal for shoe repair! I've been trying to get my boots resoled but didn't have it in me to pay $50+ bucks that they charge everywhere else. I stumbled in here and they happily fixed up in a day for a mere $12.I mean this was after their painfully awkward attempt at small talk ..."so you have family in Japan?" and "you go to the gym a lot?"... but I'll bear that much for a $12 fix up
5	Not only is he very friendly but he is fast and has the best and fair prices! He fixed two pairs of shoes for $10 in two days!  I was quoted $32 and two weeks and Northway Shoes and repair!  No reason not to give this great Guy your business!
5	He has reasonable prices, quick turn around time and a really great shoeshine woman. Two thumbs up from me.
