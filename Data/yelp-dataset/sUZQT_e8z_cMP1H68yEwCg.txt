5	I cannot believe what great customer service this place has!! I printed some shirts for the first time with my designs and they came out so beautiful!!! They were so patient and accommodating, I could not ask for anything more...The quality for the cost is unsurpassed! I highly recommend doing business here!!
5	These guys are awesome! I needed shirts printed in less than 24 hours due to an error at another shop and they totally came through for me! No only did they rush my shirts, but they managed to print them out in AMAZING quality, and the bag they gave me them in also had my design printed on it! They even had it ready 3 hours earlier than they had originally quoted! Excellent product and super friendly and efficient staff! Can't tell you how impressed and excited I am! I will definitely be coming back and getting more things printed!
5	This is THE PLACE if you are looking for professional, fast and very kind people, thank you so much guys you rock !
5	These people were amazing and affordable. Our company is hosting a charity event for a coworker and we couldn't have done it without them! Everyone was so accommodating.
5	I had the most amazing service from when I emailed the company to get a price quote, and when I walked in the door and there was already a sample shirt printed out with my logo on it - all the way through to the completion of the shirts.  I even got to keep the sample shirt as an extra!  The rush fee I required was minimal compared to this company's competitors, and the prices were HALF of what I would pay elsewhere.  Plus, at the end of it all I got a personalized paper bag with my logo printed on to the front of it.  I was able to use that bag as a gift bag for my event, and it was ADORED.  So happy with the service, quality, and pricing I received.  I definitely will not go anywhere else.
