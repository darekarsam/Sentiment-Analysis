4	Just took my little Lulu there, she started yelping and was in pain and I couldn't figure out why.  She's a chiweenie, so was worried about her back, as weenie dogs tend to have back problems.  Can't remember which doctor I saw, but he did a very thorough physical exam, turns out she has a pain in her neck, not sure why.  After a toenail clipping and some medications, we are on our way home. Let's hope this makes her better, I love my pets, they are like my kids.
4	My family used to take our dogs here when I was younger.  I remember absolutely loving the play ship they had for kids.  The decor is also very nice.  We now take our dogs somewhere closer that we like better, but nothing bad happened that caused us to leave.  The staff was always very friendly and Dr. Noe is gentle with the animals.
5	We took our dog here for years, and while we recently switched vets, I honestly have no complaints about Noe's.  The facility is always clean and doesn't smell, feels modern, and the front desk staff has always been VERY friendly.  Assistants and vets seem to care about us as customers/patients.  They used to offer very affordable boarding that we used a few times, but seems like they've gone away from that.  I didn't really ever feel a sense of loyalty to them, probably because we always saw someone different when we took our animals in.  And probably also because we typically only went in one visit a year.  But I also never felt short changed or mistreated.  It's a good vet.
