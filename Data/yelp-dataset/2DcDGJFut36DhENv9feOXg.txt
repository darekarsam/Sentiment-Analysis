5	I use this Walgreens constantly. If you are in the vicinity of this Walgreens and desire a clean establishment with an assortment of food, consumer, and houseware items - this is your place!I have also used the photo kiosks - both in store and uploading them first online - and let me tell you that it ROCKS! Much easier than trying to get your color printer at home to do the photos "right". And for 15 cents a print - you can't go wrong!TIP: For photo printing you can upload online to this location with SAME day pick-up for most sizes! Really convenient!
5	Awesome service in the photo department, fast, friendly, helpful.
4	I get my prescriptions from this location. It's close, convenient, and they make it really easy to get automatic refills. The staff at the pharmacy are very friendly and helpful!
