5	I initially saw the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater perform on "So you think you can dance" over a year ago. Once I heard that they were going to perform in Charlotte, I just had to get tickets.My husband and I spent Valentine's Day at the Knight Theater for their last performance in town. Spectacular! They are amazing dancers and their body control is phenomenal. The show lasted approximately 2.5 hours and it was worth every penny and moment (they have a couple of intermissions).I highly recommend going to see them perform if they ever come back to our area.
5	I saw the dance company at Blumenthal where I sat in orchestra front abduction center.  However, seeing them again at Knight was a last minute decision that resulted in a great experience. Our seats were ib the balcony allowing us to see the entire stage. We saw performers that we missed by sitting close to the stage.  What a peasant surprise!  We developed a new may of seeing and appreciating Alvin Ailey Dance Theater.
5	I went to the performance on Tuesday, May 15, 2012 with my mother.  We both enjoyed the show.  She raved about it to my aunts and stated she "hopes to see it again."  I will be recommending it to everyone.  Hopefully, I will be able to see it New York.
