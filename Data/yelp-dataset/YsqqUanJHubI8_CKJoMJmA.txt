3	Came here for a work lunch. Looks very swank when you walk in, but due to the really high ceilings, the place is really loud even when it's not packed. They have a pretty nice terrasse as well, but it was far too cold to even attempt to eat out there.There are quite a few wines by the glass which is nice, but the beer selection certainly wasn't the best. Lunch was pretty good, but nothing too special and the price tag was pretty high, even by Outremont standards (tiny appy and then fish & chips: 20$)I'd come again, but next time I would go for the mussels I think as they looked a lot better than my very fried fish et frites.
2	This is my second visit and likely my last. I was so disappointed in the food quality and service. I treated a friend to the table d'hote and was horrified that she received a burnt  puck of beef after waiting an unreasonable amount of time. The fact the server did not even acknowledge the poor quality/presentation and never asked if we enjoyed the meal, reflects the nonchalance attitude of this place. I am a firm  believer that a sever is the representative of the food and the establishment. And when they don't take ownership of the experience, there's no reason to go back.
