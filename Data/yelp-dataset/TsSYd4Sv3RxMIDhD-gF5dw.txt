5	They have really good pizza, its fast and ive ordered from here more then a dozen time and i've never had a problem.
1	Extremely disappointed!!! I normally don't go with the big pizza chains, but I saw a commercial and got a craving. Well, I really wish I would've done that. I ordered an all meats pizza that tasted fine, but after eating three pieces I paid for this for the next 36 hours.I got food poisoning and was in bad shape. The following day I called and shared this with a Papa Johns manager who told me that they "try to check the meats and vegetables everyday and that she wasn't sure what could've happened." She did tell me that she would pass the info along to her general manager.I have never received a call back from anyone regarding this event. I learned my lesson! No more pizza from this place and very disappointed with the customer service.
