5	Renaissance is like a Salvation Army or Value Village with a solid focus on supporting the local community. This one is 3 stories under the weird and wonderful arches of the Plaza St Hubert. It's hit or miss because that's how second hand shopping works, , and I've never had the best luck here but I love it anyway.
