4	A wonderful place to visit as Notre-Dame Basilica of Montreal is just across the street!  if you take the subway, get off at Station place d'Armes (makes sense, right?), and walk toward the old port.
5	Ricky, at the front desk, has been unbelievably accommodating.  He even wrote us a handwritten note to welcome us to the hotel and gave us two complimentary drinks at the hotel bar which were fantastic.  We got a junior suite and it has an electric fireplace and exposed brick as well as a hot tub.  Couldn't be happier.  The location is fantastic as well!  We'll be back very soon!!  I can't speak highly enough of the place.
