5	Terrific place to shop for both in stock jewelry and custom made pieces along with repairs. The quality and prices are fabulous. I wouldn't shop anywhere else for my jewelry.
5	Such a great establishment!! They fixed my great grandmothers antique ring for a third of what another jeweler quoted and did it perfectly. The women that work there and own the place are so knowledgeable and helpful and their selection of antique jewelry is absolutely beautiful. They are my favorite jeweler in Charlotte!
1	Purchsed two rings in 2012 with a discount since I was paying in cash, any shady business' favorite form of payment. The girl promised that she would purchase the rings back if my husband and I decided to upgrade or did not like the rings anymore. I liked that added value because I felt later down the road I could afford to buy a nicer diamond. Much to my surprise, even with a reference to the amount paid in 2012, she offers to purchase it back for a mere 1/3 of the original cash price! They are the greediest family I have encountered with a business on South Blvd.  Guns, locked doors, and dated surveillance all to protect them from crooks when they are the real robbers. Piss poor and I hope they close for such shady business habits!
