4	Very friendly staff and the crepes were tasty.  I enjoyed the cider and the creme brulee was legit.
1	Terrible service - slow, indifferent, inhospitable.  Mediocre food.  So many better places - don't waste your money.
4	Gluten-free buckwheat crepes! They were delicious. Nice and crispy on the outside but with a little bit of chew. Definitely different but welcomed into my tummy for sure. They use regular crepe batter for dessert. We had the chocolate banana praline and the crepe suzette. Dang, both were a slam dunk. Crepes done right, for sure!
4	I'm eager to go back to this place, the crepes were delicious and they had a wide variety to choose from. The food was excellent but the service is so so.
5	After walking around in cold Montreal, we were hungry and wanted to grab a bite to eat. We had walked in front of this place and made our way back because it looked like an authentic place, plus we are also Frenchies and LOVE crepes! We were not disappointed! The crepes and French Onion soup were super yummy. The service was quick and our waitress was very friendly!
