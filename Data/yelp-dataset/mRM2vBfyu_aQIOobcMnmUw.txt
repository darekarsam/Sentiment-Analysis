5	Great prices, wide and varied selection, and a sweet, attentive, knowledgeable owner, Mike Fernandez.  Has both indoor, outdoor and dinnerware pottery from Mexico (not China!).
5	My wife and I were looking for a nice chiminea for our backyard, and decided to stop here before our long drive to Sedona for one we saw there. Glad we stopped in because we got one for about $100 less, and also some other cool things to throw in our backyard. Mike, the owner, was very friendly, and fully explained to us how to properly use and care for our new fireplace. We were very impressed with our purchases, the knowleadge Mike gave us, and the service he provided. Prices were reasonable. If you're looking for some nice southwest decor to spruce up your yard, check this family-owned place out.
