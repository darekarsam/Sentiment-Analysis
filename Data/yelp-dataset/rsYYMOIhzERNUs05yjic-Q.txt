5	A great gym for women.  I highly recommend this location.  Clean, fun, simple, convenient and it really works.  The owner is very personable.  The Zumba is the circuit is a blast.
5	I have been a member of Curves for over 7 years and have been a member of Curves South Mountain for more than 2 years. Curves South Mountain is the only way to work out! You get a full body workout in 30 minutes! A must for the busy woman! Curves South Mountain offers great incentives to work out like Zumba, 28 day workouts and other promotions which are optional for members and are helpful to optimize your workout! All this and a conscientious owner who is always reinventing the club to provide the best experience!
