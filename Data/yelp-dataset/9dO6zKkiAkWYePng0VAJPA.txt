4	The Premium North Outlets are likely to be the death of me in one way or another; either financial when people like Sylvia convince me that I shouldn't be without a grey, rainproof 3/4 length trench or literally when I have a stroke trying to exit the parking structure.  Always top quality and in this instance more than 75% off retail I'm hoping for the former.
1	I like Hugo Boss, I own many articles of clothing that are Hugo Boss.I can't go into this store.They pump some random candle scent into the whole thing.Let me explain something basic to you retail geniuses out there. If you want to do something that sets you apart, make sure it does not have the potential to backfire.Some people are sensitive to smell. Pumping a scent into your store, unless it's fresh-baked cookies, crepes, bacon or other delicious food item, can only potentially shoo people away.You cater primarily to men. Why in the world would you pump in a FLORAL scent?I will never shop at a Hugo Boss outlet as long as you keep pumping this scent in. Whoever the brainiac was that thought this was a good idea should be fired.
3	I like Hugo Boss, but this store seemed really disorganized (at least for men's suits). Suits are mixed and matched everywhere and if you find one that you like, it's hard to just find it in your size because likely the style you do like is the only one sitting on the rack.
