1	This rating is for the agent not for Mercury Insurance.
1	Good luck getting any service once they have you.  No one return calls or emails you back.  This isn't a onetime issue, its ongoing.  I had better service from one of the big company who didn't even have a local agent.   Now looking for a new agency.
5	My experience has been good with Hayden. Just renewed for a second year for my business insurance and have only good things to say. Just what you'd expect with a traditional insurance agency. They are independent, and shop all of the options and try to find the one best suited for your situation. I prefer having the option of talking face-to-face with people I do business with, and getting straight answers, etc.
