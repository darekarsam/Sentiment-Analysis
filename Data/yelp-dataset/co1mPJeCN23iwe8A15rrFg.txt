4	I called Miracle Touch to give me a quote in regards to some paint and scratches on my brand new truck. Even though I hit the clicker at a security gate, the bar came down on my truck and got dragged up my windshield frame and down the cab. Ramsey, met me at my work the next day and when all was said and done all the paint and and scratches were gone. I know he had to put some elbow grease down because the dings looked pretty deep. The only thing I can still see is the initail dent where the bar first hit. I can see it but I don't think others will unless I point it out.  If I would have filed a claim with my insurance I wouldv'e paid a $250.00 deductible. Ramsey charged me $45.00. Thanks again
5	I called on Miracle Touch to help with my pings and scratches. I have a new 2014 and treat it like a baby and I like it looking like new. Ramsey came to our house and restored it back to showroom looks. I'm elated with his service and professionalism.If you need the job done than Ramsey your guy! I also like the fact that he travels to you and it allows you to get on with your day.
5	Ramsey did an amazing job on fixing a large chip on my hood and scratches on my bumper.  I love that he came to me versus having to sit at a shop wasting time.
