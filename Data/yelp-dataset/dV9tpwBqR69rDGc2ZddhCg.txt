5	Little Cesar's move over there is a new sheriff in town!! Great little pizza joint with good customer service, will def be back again and again!!!
5	The store is clean, the staff is very friendly and polite. The Pizza is good, but once I found out they'll add toppings to the cheesy bread, I was hooked. These things are addictive :). We've been back 3 or 4 times now for these cheese sticks....PS: get the bacon!
4	The staff isn't exceedingly friendly, but they're not rude either. That's the one thing this place is missing. The food is fantastic, I love it, I've been looking for a new pizza joint and Take or Bake is it. I'm not going to bore you with superlatives and fancy adjectives describing their food, rather simply saying that their pizza is damn good, and you should give them a try. If you're disappointed then your tastebuds are broken and you're probably walking around while in a coma. Shame on you. Enjoy their food!
3	Take or Bake I like the concept of someone else making a pizza and then you take it home and cook it. At take or bake it's just as the name implies, take it home and bake it yourself or have them bake it for you. I figured that the pizza would be similar in taste to that of Little Caesar's. Good price, but you get what you pay for, and I was correct. The pizza isn't bad, but what can you expect for $5.99.  The pizza isn't  as good as any traditional pizza places  but you could do worse in a pinch.
5	Very friendly staff. Took a pizza home to bake and was delicious! Will definitely be stopping back again.
