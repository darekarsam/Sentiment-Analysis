1	Welcome to the culinary apocalypse. Simply not knowing any better, and wanting a quick bite to eat, we went in. I ordered the Stroganoff but got something akin to diluted sour cream soup with chewy "beef." My spouse ordered the smoked cheese ravioli in the garlic sauce and it smelled analogous to seafood which had been dipped in liquid smoke. We have now lived through the apocalypse, and our tummies are very angry with us. Also, a man started eating his food, off the counter, while still in line. Total weirdness. But, hey, on the upshot, the garlic bread tastes like garlicky white bread candy.
5	Gluten-free pasta!
