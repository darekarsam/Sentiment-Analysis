4	Watch your clothes tho.... Had a pair of pj bottoms go missing
5	In addition to having top load washers (my preferred) for only $1 a load, dryers that actually dry your clothes fully in only 20 minutes for .50 cents, they also provided free laundry detergent and bleach!  We got our laundry done for a mere $8 in record time.  They also provide free wifi that actually works well.
5	If I could give this company a 10, I would!!! Me, my aunt and husband stayed at Planet Hollywood and I ran out of clothes sooner than expected. I found their add in one of the pamphlets that you see everywhere and called them. They came to my hotel room with a suit case, I filled it up, they left. I was able to pick up my clothes the next day at the bell hop desk. All pieces of clothes were folded nicely and smelt great! What a relief if was to use this service and not have to sit at a laundry mat while we where on vacation! The guy who came to our room was super friendly too! I HIGHLY recommend this company!
4	Had to wash a cal king blanket and used Waschen Guer's service for the first time today. Louis helped me with the task and he has been sweet a llll the way. When I first called he offered to show up in 15 mins but I actually had to schedule for another day for pick up. It was washed and returned to me within a few hours on the same day! It is a $25 flat rate as long as the laundry can fit into this plastic tub 25"X17.5"X10". It's a BIG tub, can fit A LOT. Did I mention about the SWEETEST blue Volkswagen vintage van that is used for pickup?? LOVE IT. The only thing that I didn't love is the smell of the detergent they use. But hey, it definitely smells better than your dirty laundry.
5	Perfect for travellers. They picked up my washing from my hotel & returned it. Same day delivery. $25 - awesome bargain. Highly recommend
5	This is the best laundry service of its kind in Vegas, super fast and efficient the best part is they pick up and deliver right to our condo
