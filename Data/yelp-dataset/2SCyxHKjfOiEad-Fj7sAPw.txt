5	Great service.  Extremely knowledgeable.  Eugene was great!
5	If one is in need of anything Montblanc this is THE store to which you need to pay a visit.  I emphasize the word because this particular location is that good.  On the occasion of my visit I was fortunate to have Julie Y. approach, greet and later proceed to demonstrate for me Montblanc's Oyster Grey ink.  She would also produce and show to my fiance a Princess Grace fountain pen.  Julie is an All-Star and the store is spacious with a large selection of merchandise.  I concur with a statement from the 4/4/2013 review, "...shop at Montblanc!"
3	As to be expected, professional, courteous customer service, and a bit more relaxed atmosphere too.Satsuki was very patient in letting me touch and feel the different men's leather wallets; liked to point out that their brand is 100% full leather.Quite a big store, at the Palazzo's Grand Canal Shoppes.  Located off to the side.
