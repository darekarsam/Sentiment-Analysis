1	The worst of steam table food:  mostly tasteless and dried out.  Pricey for bland stuff.  The pizza was fresh but was on a terrible crust and had no taste.  There are so many better choices nearby.
2	Some things were very delicious while other had been sitting in a food warmer all day. Hit and miss
4	We had an afternoon meal in this place. The staff were very friendly and helpfull. We like buffet restaurants because they make it possible to collect exactly the type of food that you want in the amount that you like. We enjoyed our meal and we will certainly be back when we are in the neigbourhoud.
1	Pure veggie, but generally quite overpriced. It's a self-serve cafeteria place with the final price based on weight.  Went today and we found the selections to be stale, poorly presented and inconsistently cooked.  Some dishware was dirty.  My wife was nauseated by her dish to the extent that it spoiled the afternoon. My brussels sprouts tasted and had the texture of having been on the cooker for the last 6 hours, which I suspect was actually the case. The unilingual French signage regarding specials sent an unwelcoming message to Anglophones. Even though I have been a vegetarian for a decade,  I'll settle for even the minimalist Burger King veggie option before I return.
1	Horrific; Cold food that is overpriced and not seasoned at all. As for the service, it's almost like the staff is paid NOT to care about your needs.I don't believe this place will be in business for long.
