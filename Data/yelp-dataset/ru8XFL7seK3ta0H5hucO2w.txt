3	French from France. Close to home. Breakfast. I really want(ed) to love this place. Unfortunately, the service was super slow. Food was a bit bland, although there were some high points. Coffee was just so so. Trusted friends and spouse report similar experiences. They're pretty new and might just be ironing out the kinks...  1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here.
