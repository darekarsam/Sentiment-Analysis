4	This restaurant is delicious! It's great for a date or for a group. It's a greek restaurant but not the souvlaki type. I would recommend ordering some appetizers to share and then a fresh fish, grilled. They always have great options for fish, always changing, and always fresh. If you don't want to share the fish, you can always choose one of their fillet options or giant shrimp or scallops. This place can sometimes get busy on the weekends but I've never had trouble getting a table for two. Once we had to wait a bit, but never more then 15min without a reservation. They do have a bar and you can always sit and have a drink while waiting. The staff is friendly and the bartender can make a pretty good martini.
4	We had a really, really good dinner here tonight. The service was excellent - attentive and helpful but not overpowering. The food was tasty, presented well and accompanied by some nice side dishes. I definitely plan on eating there again.
4	Yummy, grilled octopus, fresh fish, warm bread with amazing Taziki. Lovely hostess (maybe owner), whenever we land at YUL, straight to Ella Grill. Not commercial, NO GYROS...high quality GREEK food, with Montreal ambiance !
