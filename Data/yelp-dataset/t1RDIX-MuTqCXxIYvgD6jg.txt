4	Paid 50$ for a filling meal for two people (Burrito, Chimichanga, Cactus hearts, beer, shot). Decent good mexican food, good free salsa as premeal snack. Too bad they don't have a `submarino" drink on the menu, but ordering a Corona + Shot did the trick, though kinda expensive (about 11$ total).Enjoy!
3	Came here for brunch on a sunday, L`avenue du plateau had a hugge line. the southwest omelette was ok, so was the classico benedict was fine. The waiter was hurried, rushing everywhere, but forgetful and sloppy. I had no napkin`s for my entire meal and had to share my bfs. nothing memorable, would not return. i liked the decor though.
