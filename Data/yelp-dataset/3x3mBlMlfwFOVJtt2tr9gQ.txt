5	Great chicken a great prices. This location is in Wilkinsburg right next to the busway. They offer mild or spicy flavored chicken. They also offer popcorn shrimp, chicken bowls, nuggets, sandwiches and tenders. Their sides consists of red beans and rice, mashed potatoes, cole slaw, cajun battered fries and biscuits. They have a drive thru if you're in a hurry. Everything is mmm mmm good!
5	As good as it gets in Pittsburgh for Cajun food.  Red-beans-and-rice, and (sometimes) gumbo, etouffee, crawfish and jambalaya. Plus the chicken is better than KFC.
