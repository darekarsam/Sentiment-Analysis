2	Staff were a bit slow to serve and at times Ithought they had forgotten about us and the other two customers that were waiting.I forgave this once were served, as the staff member was very efficient and we managed to make our decision, pay and get out of the shop really quick despite it being the end of the day.The prices are really good but I'd hate to try shopping here when it's busy and you're not sure if what's in front of you is the right item or not.
