4	I've only been in Charlotte for a couple years and this is the first auto garage I've used down here. It's owned and operated by two brothers I believe. They did a great job and worked with me on the price. In the end I feel like they are a very reputable company that won't rip you off. I actually need to have some work done on my wife's car and plan on calling them to do the work.
5	Tony Killman is probably as good as it gets in the car service business. I feel like he is honest and straight-forward. I've taken my cars to him twice now and his repair work was prompt and I thought his pricing was very reasonable. One time, I went in thinking it was one thing and they found it was something else that was less expensive. The other time it was a little more - but my point is, I feel like I'm getting honest information. But each time the pricing was affordable. You can't ask for more than that. I appreciate working with a service team that is eager to help and also seems to work on your car the same way if it was the car of someone in their own family. As for me, I'm sticking with Killman Automotive.
5	I was referred to Killman Automotive via a friend in 2008. Since then, I've brought all of my out-of-warranty repairs to them. Straight answers, few 'sales jobs' and a staff that knows their autos. In my opinion, that is a homerun.
