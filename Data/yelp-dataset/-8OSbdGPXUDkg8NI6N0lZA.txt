5	Hadrian's Brasserie is a far cry from the stereotype that British cuisine is bland. In fact if I could sum up my experiences at Hadrian's in one word it would be: impeccable. The service, impeccable. The decor, the menu selection, the plating of the dishes, the wine selection, the bathrooms, etc.Eating here adds a splash of colour and infusion of flavour to a dreary Edinburgh day. The entrees are innovative, delicious and beautifully presented. And the desserts are sweet/creamy/tart when they need to be.Recommendations:Hadrian's Brasserie knows how to prepare their fish. Vanilla Bourbon creme brulee (creamy delicious with just the right kick from the bourbon).
