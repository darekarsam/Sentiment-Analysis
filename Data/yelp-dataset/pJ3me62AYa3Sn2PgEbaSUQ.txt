2	So, I got a groupon for this place, and from the reviews that I read, it seemed great.The salon was nice and clean, very organized. The music playing was nice and in tune with the holidays. Janessa was very nice and personable. Easy to make conversation with. She took great care of my nails and did a really nice job shaping, and manicuring them. The only problem is that she applied the gel nail polish as though she only had a drop left in the bottle, so the layers were very thin. I believe this is what led to them chipping the very next day. In all of my years of getting gel manicures, I have NEVER had any of my nails chip before at least 2 weeks of having them. I dont do much with my hands to have them chip, so I am confused as to why they did. After a week they looked like regular nail polish that had chipped a lot! I am very disappointed that they didnt live up to the "no chip" title that they have.
