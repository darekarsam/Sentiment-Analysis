5	I have used Ribbons & Lace for as long as I can remember. When I started my business, Lacy Bella Designs, I started using them to get bulk orders for shipping. They have an amazing selection of not just ribbons, but bows, embellishments, tulle, and flowers. It's a crafter's paradise! And if you aren't a crafter, they sell bows & headbands that are ready to wear.
5	I love this store! Nowhere else have I found this kind of variety! There is an incredible amount of ribbon to choose from plus other ribbon related supplies. The staff is always super helpful and friendly! I look forward to going in every time!
