5	VERY HAPPY WITH THE SERVICE FOR OVER 1 1/2 YEARS- RECOMMEND THEM!I have used this company for over a year and a half. I have had others that I was not thrilled about. Ever since I have used this company, my yard has looked better than anyone's on my block. There has been many people that have used this company as well and are very happy with the service. I have had trees trimmed, vines clipped, gravel racked and much more and every time they come out it looks GREAT!Sean is the owner and he is very upfront about what needs to be done. I had a tree in my front yard that his higher than my house that needed to be trimmed and have big branches cut off. I had three people besides this company come out to give me an estimate and I didn't tell any of them I was getting other estimates. When Sean came out to give me the estimate, he beat it by hundreds! Several companies gave me crazy numbers and Sean was very reasonable. He was up front with me and I have never gotten an invoice that is more than what he says. If I have any question, Sean calls me right away and does what he can to help. All the work has been appreciated and I haven't seen them cut corners. We are very happy with the service and recommend this company to anyone that is looking for quality service.
5	Sean and his crew have been amazing. Do a great job and very dependable. Have always done a great job with the yard, keeping up on the trees and shrubs, but have also been very responsive when I have needed more care and repairs on things they are not normally responsible for. My phone calls are always answered and needs met. Have often thought "I should do this myself" but then they come through and I know the job is done better than I ever could. The yard looks great and it is one less thing that I have to worry about. Now I get to say "Yay! I don't have to do that." Thanks Sean, much success in 2015.
