4	I like the apartment complex. I've lived here 6 months and have no big complaints.  The grounds are kept really nice and it is safe and clean. The units are spacious the updated apartments are really nice. The only negative I would say is the lack of parking or small spaces assigned. Neighbors are nice and it is quiet. I wouldn't pass up on looking here for a good and centrally located place to live.
1	I HATE this complex! The management staff is very rude and treat residents like crap. Do yourself and find another place in the area. This place is a ripoff and overall pain. There's plenty of nice condos in the area just check padmapper or zillow. Save yourself and stay away!!!!!
4	I lived here for 5 years until recently. Decent pricing for the neighborhood. Moved to another apartment in the complex when they weren't renewing leases so they could remodel. The new apartment was awesome! It had great upgrades and made me realize what crap out old unit was. Unfortunately our new neighbor was a raging alcoholic and chain smoker. Ended up breaking my lease early so I wouldn't get lung cancer or the same drinking problem just to sleep with all his noise. They have two nice pools and a dog friendlyish park right next door. The office staff, especially Adriana, have always been really helpful, friendly, and professional. If I had to live in an apartment again, which I never intend on doing, it would be the Palms. That is if my old neighbor has succumb to cirrhosis of the liver by then.
