3	First time in this hobby store. I was looked after right away and thay had what I was looking for. Not a big store wish it was bigger . What thay don't have thay can get it for you.
5	This place rocks!  Michael, the owner, and Alan, the inhouse pro/expert on everything, are amazing.  Been going here for over a year now and have loved watching them expand the store.  Its a pretty awesome site.  They've got everything from RC cars to planes to Helicopters.  I love how they can cater to the beginner down to the experienced experts.   Great customer service, even when they are super busy they do their best to answer all the crazy questions of people like me.   You can tell that every member of their team is passionate about what they do.  One day during the week Michael even took the time to show me all his old mini rc engines....he pretty much has a small rc museum on display in the store.  Alan has helped me repair stuff more then once and is always willing to give a good word of advice on how to avoid breaking stuff in the future and how to better fly....cause I suck. Love it!  Thanks so much for always going above and beyond to help me out guys.
5	I recommend this place. Mike and Alan are great to do business with. The prices here are very comparable to anything online. Why not support this great local business! The staff immediately asked if we needed help within a minute of arrival and they are very knowledgeable and helpful.We had a great experience here. My dad got an RC boat. Alan even customized a battery for my dad on the spot so the battery connector would work with the Deans configuration on his RC boat. We came back a second time for extra parts. Thanks Mike!We would go back to Superstition Hobby!They primarily sell RC equipment, drones, planes, helicopters, RC cars, and some FPV equipment. They also sell RC batteries, parts, and can order parts for you.
