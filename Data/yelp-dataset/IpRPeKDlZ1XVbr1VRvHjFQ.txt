1	I love Dunkin Donuts, but this place is horrible.  I don't normally give negative reviews.  I had to speak out about this one.  The donuts tasted like they were old.  I thought it was a fluke, so I went back the next day.  Again the donuts tasted old and stale.  I wondered if it was regional phenomenon, so I stopped at the Hess Truck stop in SC on my way out of town.  The Dunkin Donuts there were moist and tasty.
1	I stopped this morning for a bagel  to take home. I got it home and the bottom of the bagel was so hard I couldn't bite through it.  Horrible Dunkin Donuts...don't go there. Also, when I drove up to the drive thru window menu, I asked what kind of bagels they had. The girl said she had, among others, an egg bagel, so I ordered onhe. Upon reaching the window to pay for it, she advised me they didn't have any. HUH? I thought she just said she did. Bad news!
