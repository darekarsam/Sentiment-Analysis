1	I have never reviewed before but I feel that it is necessary to do so on this place.  This place was aweful.  Haircut was uneven and shorter than requested. When I brought it up, not even an apology...had to have then fix it but not even an offer of a discount or anything for the terrible job they did.  I will never go back there.
4	So being new to the Surprise area I have been looking for a new place to get me hair done as driving to downtown just for a cut is not in my outlook.  I have been to this location several times, and get this they remember what they did last time so they don't have to ask all the questions again like how long what number and stuff like that.  Cause I have not been to school for hair, so I don't know what number I use.  Generally I like to be the guy who jumps in the chair and the stylist goes to work and I have a good hair cut and leave.  I get that here!
4	Lady was nice and did a good job on my sons hair.  My son is 6 and can be a pain in the butt with clippers.  She was done in 10 minutes too!  Only reason it's not a 5 star is because its just a haircut.  No cleanup or gel or anything after.  No water or cool amenities.  Worth the $7.99 I paid after coupon.
