1	So we called them for service and they said they cant do it because of the 10% discount on yelp!!! That they won't make any money! Why would you even put that on your page if you can't follow through with it. My advice dont call these people at all!!
5	Called these guys to get my irrigation back flow fixed.  Bob gave me a quick and honest estimate which was much much lower than Hawthorne Plumbing or Rakeman Plumbing.  He and Matt came out when they said they would, fixed it, and waited around to make sure everything worked correctly.  Thanks guys.
5	Bob is a fully licensed plumber with a ton of expertise. He is especially conscientious. As a homeowner who has worked with a ton of contractors, believe me, I can tell you how important that is.
1	The worst!  Was happy to take my $1,125.00 to do my job but when everything that he installed leaked he would not come back and fixed it.  First time he told he was in the hospital, then it was a family problem then he stopped returning calls. Now he suggests that I call someone who lives closer to me.  What a complete POS!
5	I love this company. Bob did a great job locating a problem with a waterline for a sink we wanted installed. He explained what the problems could be and he was spot on. He fixed the problem, installed the sink and we are thrilled it didn't cost us a fortune. Thanks!
1	It was very simple.  I had a problem with what you installed, you refused to come back and fix it and now that you have been "caught" you are telling lies to try and make yourself look better.You are correct about only one thing, I DO NOT WANT YOU IN MY HOUSE AGAIN!  Someone who does substandard work, lies, cheats and steals is not welcome in my house.As an update, I called another plumber, had them come to my house, tighten the connections and there have been no further leaks.  It would have been much easier for you to stand behind your work than to create all this...
