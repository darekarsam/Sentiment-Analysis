4	I loved St Bride's as a venue for several reasons:- It makes for an intimate music venue, with tiered seating and the quirky addition of fairly lights and black curtains surrounding the performance and audience area. The result is a great atmospheric ambiance.- The community hall next door makes for a nice little chill-out area. We visited in November and the Christmas tree and decorations made us feel cosey and at home.- You won't quite believe the change you'll get back from the bar. - Super good value!- The staff were rather lovely.- Take a look up once you've taken your seat before the show. The wooden interior of the ceiling is stunning.Enjoy the show!
