5	Great cocktails and an even better staff! Ideal place for both locals and tourists to enjoy a wide assortment of drinks while staying in the downtown core.
5	This place has a cocktail game that is on point, they don't mix drinks, they craft them, and they have an impressive cocktail menu and a very professional and helpful staff to guide you if you're not quite sure which cocktail you want to try. It's a hidden gem in the heart of downtown Montreal that feels exclusive without being snobby. The ambience is great, it has perfect decor and the music doesn't drown out your voice, you can sit and have a conversation without having to shout. If you love cocktails this is the place for you, (although they do serve beer and shots as well), the drinks are perfectly crafted, from glassware to garnish, the staff makes sure each drink is perfectly made, paying attention to every minute detail and subtle touch to make sure the drink you are getting is not only delicious, but nice to look at. And I love the fact that even though the decor is so nice and the staff is so learned, you never feel out of place, you never feel like you're being served by snobs, wether you're in a suit or a hoodie, everyone is welcome. I definitely recommend this place, and if you go, order the Pimm's cocktail, a very refreshing and light drink.
5	My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this spot while waiting for a show to start at the nearby jazz club. We were thrilled with the find and a little sad to spend only a half hour there! The bartender asked us if we liked gin (which we really, really do!) and we were sold. He pulled out 4-5 varieties of gin, 2 that were just brought in, and offered us his twist on a gin & tonic. The bartender and (I'm assuming) manager were fun to talk to, very genuine and know their products (booze) well!They really know what makes a quality drink and quality service. We're sure to go back next time we're in Montreal!
