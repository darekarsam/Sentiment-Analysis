4	I love "The Toaster" opps I meant Grill Pain. That is an insider joke for the locals,,,,,,this place used to be called THE TOASTER.It is still good and a real happening place for weekend brunches. I love the crepes and egg sandwiches. I also heart any place on weekend at noon that can give me alternative choices other than eggs.
3	We visited this morning for an early birthday breakfast. The restaurant has a warm, cozy feeling, with two separate rooms and antique toasters lining the window sills. Service started out quick - our coffee and meals came out right away - but as the morning progressed, the dining room filled up and our lone waitress was left with far too many tables... so much so that we waited nearly twenty minutes for our cheque at the end of the meal. The food was pretty standard montreal breakfast fare, perhaps because we weren't too adventurous in our ordering. The highlight of our meal was, without a doubt, the toast (both French and Plain), which arrived surprisingly thick, soft, and luscious. The eggs, meat, home-fried potatoes, and fruit assortment were all par for the course. Our coffee was also only refilled once, perhaps because of the overworked wait-staff. One other note, during the meal the manager/owner of the place came over and chatted with some nearby patrons about how he'd be closing for a few weeks to do a major remodel - which is certainly in order, given the "dysfunctional" (translated, literally) status of the toilet.
