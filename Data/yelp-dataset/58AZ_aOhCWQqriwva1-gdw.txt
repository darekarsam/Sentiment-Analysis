1	It's hard to mess things up at a beer distributor.  However, South Side Beer Distributor never ceases to amaze me with how terrible they are.  I think it's the combination of awful customer service and skunked beer.  They may have a good location, but their prices are terrible and it seems like you're bothering their staff to overpay for their beer.  Thankfully, Black and Gold Beer Distributor on 10th street (technically, 1000 Bradish Street) is in the neighborhood and trumps SSBD at every corner. Sad, but true- I am pleased that I will never have to return to the beer distributor that I live less than a block from.
1	This is a truly terrible distributor. The staff always seems incredibly inconvenienced to help you, the service is curt, the prices are higher than anywhere around, and the only time you can get a cold case seems to be in the winter when they leave the garage doors open and use mother natures refrigerator. Avoid this place, there is a much better distributor on 10th street.
5	Best service I've ever had anywhere!!! I'm from MI and travel the entire east coast all the time. I love Yuengling and they had the best price and were truly kind. I would definitely recomend this place.
