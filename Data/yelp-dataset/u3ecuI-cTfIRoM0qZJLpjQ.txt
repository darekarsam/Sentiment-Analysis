5	Went on the crawl last night! Cool bars, great hosts, plan on doing it again! Great deals & you visit some of the best bars downtown! Got some really good drink specials at every spot. I have done a crawl before but never downtown... This one was by far the best.
5	This was my first time doing a pub crawl and I really enjoyed it. The staff was very friendly and kept us on a nice pace. Great drink specials. Awesome mixture of bars and clubs. Entertainment from start to finish. I would definitely recommend this pub crawl.Keep up the amazing work VNC!
