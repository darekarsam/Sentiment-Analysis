4	This one's definitely not like the Little Bead Shop in Bruntsfield. Cause it's pretty massive. Or at least massive as far as bead shops are concerned. I mean, you'd think, beads being so small, you wouldn't need much space to display them, but you do. Or at least in the case of this bead shop you do. I'm not much an expert in bead shops. I have no idea what bead shops are supposed to be like, but this one seems pretty well equipped to deal with all your bead needs. They even run workshops (which can be seen on their website). You can take lessons in how to make earrings, necklaces and all such jewellery-related things. This shop isn't the easiest to find, since it's not on Stockbridge's main drag, but if you just go to the end of Raeburn place and take a left at the St Columbo's Hospice Charity, you'll find it easy.
5	This was the first bead shop I went to and I've gone back again and again. The girls are all really friendly and helpful and no question is too daft!I order a lot from them online and always get my order quickly - no matter how big it is. They always go out of their way to help whethe instore or by email or facebook.Definitely recommend The Bead Shop Edinburgh to all beaders everywhere!! And most definitely a returning customer!!
5	UPDATE: This branch is now closed, but you can still shop online and in their Haddington branch.I do have a strong affinity with this shop because I work there part time. BUT (and it's a big but) I also shop there a lot. Mostly for the seed beads, to which I am addicted, but also for the sterling silver findings (ditto). I do shop in other bead stores (sorry boss) but only because no one bead shop can carry every colour of seed bead. For range, prices and service (even when I'm not working), you can't beat The Bead Shop Edinburgh.
