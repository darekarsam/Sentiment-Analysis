5	I went into the nail shop for the first time this weekend and boy am I glad that I did! The service there was top notch. I have never had a pedicure where they use the citric acid of an orange to help manage dry skin. The products used were fragrant and quality which made me not mind spending money. Teresa, the nail designer is so artistic and takes pride in her unique designs. Overall, I had a great experience and I will definitely be going back. I love my nails!! Thanks guys.
5	I absolutely love this place! Teresa takes my breath away with her designs and quality of work. Toby is always so nice and welcoming! I am constantly telling people to come here!!! Best place I've been to by far!
5	Amazing!!! That's literally all I can think to describe my experience at this salon. I called 20 minutes before closing and Tony said he would gladly wait for me, although I felt super bad about going in late they didn't seem mad at all, Teresa did my nails beautiful way beyond my expectations and she still took her time after closing. They truly appreciate every costumer and they have a lot of regulars becuase once you go there it's hard to find better service anywhere else. After this being my first time coming here I will be a regular for sure !
