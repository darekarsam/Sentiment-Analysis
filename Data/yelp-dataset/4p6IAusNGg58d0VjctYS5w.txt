5	Ok...I just found THEEE best carpet cleaners in Las Vegas!!!  I just moved into a rental home and the carpet was trashed!!! I had received a flyer about NEX Carpet Cleaning, so I thought I would give them a shot. I thought they were going to tell me my carpet would have to be replaced but they went to work and the carpet looks like brand new again...night and day difference!!! They did an AMAZING job!!!  Francis and Sarah (the managers) came out today, even on a holiday Monday. They are incredibly reasonably priced in comparison to the other companies as well. A good carpet cleaning company is hard to find...I recommend them HIGHLY!!!
5	Very nice and they did an awesome job. Will definitely use them again.
5	Sarah and Francis are an awesome team!  They gave me same day service, were on time, friendly, honest, and took there time.  There was no up-selling, pricing was great, but most importantly the job was high quality! You simply can't ask for more.  Thanks again!!!
5	After Honest Tech Carpet Care tried to rip me off yesterday, I went on Yelp and did some research (I should've researched Honest Tech Carpet beforehand). NEX Carpet Cleaning stood out because the reviews are all rated 5 Stars and seem "legit" and from "real" customers. When I called to get a quote, Sarah was really nice, and the price she quoted me seemed fair and reasonable, so I decided to use them. I was already impressed that they were on time (actually 8 mins early). After Sarah went room-to-room, they brought in their equipments, and immediately went to work.  They worked really hard, and I can just tell that they took pride in their work.  They did a FABULOUS job-my carpet and rugs look awesome and new!  I highly recommend this company.  I truly wish NEX Carpet Cleaning the best and much success with their business, because this is a business with integrity!!
