4	Nice area with an outdoor deck.  Friendly service.  Only ordered some Chip and Dip from the Fore D'Oeuvres and had a drink but looks like a nice place for some pub grub after hitting some golf balls.  I think they had 4 or 5 beers on tap.  The menu is on a large TV and of course some hand menu's.  Will have to stop back and grab some lunch or dinner.
4	Super impressed! This place is a total 180 from 5 years ago. The bar atmosphere is great, huge TVs from all angles with good food to boot. Super glad to have a new hangout in town.Update... Three things that came came to mind while eating here.1. I wish the bar served drinks in glassware as apposed to plastic cups.2. They'd sell a lot more drinks if they had a server work the room (as I was feeling to lazy to walk to the bar for a second drink)3. They need deserts on there menu.
4	The new restaurant at cool springs is a much needed addition. The inside is clean, modern and bright. Granite/rock counters, large windows, gorgeous patio seating outside and a large bar. The menu is what you would expect it to be- burgers, pizzas, apps, salads. We tried out a salad and 4 meat pizza. The salad was great with dark greens, no iceberg here. The pizza was also very good with the exception of the crust which was obviously not homemade. The only downfall, in my opinion, is that you order at the counter and seat yourself. The line at the counter can be long and the tables fill up fast on busy days.
4	Excellent place to watch the game. Wish I would have come here earlier in the year to take advantage of the outdoor patio. Damn oncoming winter. I digress. Good food, nice beer selection. A real live Happy Hour. Can't ask for much more. Cheers.
