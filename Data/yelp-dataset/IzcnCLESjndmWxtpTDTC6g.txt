5	What a WONDERFUL service!  Our Golden was "banished" from her last groomer for acting out, so we needed to find a mobile groomer.  We were paying $55 plus a tip at our old place, but Debora charged us only $50.  What is the most interesting to me is that one mobile service quoted me $120, so I know we received a bargain.Maddie received highly personalized service, and did not want Debora to leave.  Do not hesitate to use Angel Tails Dog Grooming.  The professionalism and care shown were amazing, and Maddie is proudly showing off her new "do."
5	I been to many groomers and I finally find the best one.she does such a good job my dogs loves her:)
1	This groomer may have good reviews but she was less than polite on the phone.She is NOT taking any new clients.  I inquired why this wasn't on her website and she got huffy with me.  When I informed her that I would be putting a comment on yelp she was not happy and hung up me.  She may be good with dogs but not so much  with humans.  Ruff! Ruff!rI stand by my comments.  I used a competitor and they were fine.  The subject service is not taking clients.
