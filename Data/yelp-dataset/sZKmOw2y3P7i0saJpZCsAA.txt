3	Yummy!
4	I walked in the store to grab dinner.  I had not had my fried chicken fix in awhile.  I have a coupon for 10 chicken tenders with 2 sides.  Then I got a call from my husband that he wanted fried chicken not the tenders, so since I already placed my order I had to order a family dinner with sides and the honey butter biscuits.  The staff was friendly and funny.  A dine-in customer question why is the chicken breast so small.  The girls said yes that is the size of our breast, our wings are normal huge compare to the other stores (KFC).  Then all 3 of us locked eyes and laughed.  The staff said I just said my breast is small.  LOL!!!  The fried chicken was good, crispy (both tenders and original).  The corn on the cob was just buttery and no flavor.  The mash potatoes were ok.  The honey butter biscuits were yumtastic!  I know, I think my heart stopped beating for a few mins after the my meal.
2	Waited forever for my order to be taken, forever to receive it.  Of course. ..it was horrible.  I dont know what part of the chicken I was given, but it was not a wing. Almost $9 for a 3 piece combo that should have been wings. At least everything was hot. That's the only reason I am not giving one star.
1	Worst church's chicken EVER. I'm new to the avondale area so I figured I'd try the nearest church's chicken. BIG mistake. I was literally in line for 45 mins and when we got up to the window, there were 3 girls standing around talking. We got home only to find out that they forgot all of our biscuits. Worst part, the chicken was disgusting. It was the toughest piece of chicken I've ever had. I took 1 bite and didn't touch the rest b/c it didn't even look like it was cooked right. I didn't even feed that chicken to my dog. I will NEVER go back to this location & the manager will be getting an ear full tomorrow morning.
