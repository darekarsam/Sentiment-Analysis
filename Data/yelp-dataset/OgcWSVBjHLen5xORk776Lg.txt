3	Nothing fancy...just good, filling diner food.  Recommended for lunch.  The fish plate is a good bet.
4	My daily lunch spot for month. Tried all their salads and I still love it. Nice services and the cash ladies are so nice.
2	The Cobb Salad was a disappointment.  The blue cheese crumbles were NOT fresh and had that funky-cheese taste that indicated it needed to be tossed out rather than tossed into a salad!   There were only 3 or 4 paper thin slices of avocado, and some the lettuce was what you would get when you're at the core of the lettuce head. The bacon and egg were pretty decent.  But for 7.95?  It's not worth it to me.  Amazingly, I had this same salad about a year and a half year ago....and it seemed to have a WHOLE lot more to it - tomatoes and such.  I ordered this particular salad as a takeout order, and went on my recollection of the cobb salad that I had previously.  I don't foresee ever returning there for anything else.
3	We went for brunch and the food was just ok. I had a pimento grilled cheese and I've had better. Fries were average. People were super nice but overall it was nothing special.
2	Cheap, whole in the wall place.  Food was ok.  Not worth returning to.  It's good for all the businesses around that area in what appears to be food desert.  I just wouldn't go out of your way to go there.  The restaurant was clean and the people were nice.
