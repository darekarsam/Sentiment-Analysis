5	Honest, straightforward, great workers! These are not usually adjectives to describe most repair services, but it describes Reliance. Thank you Dalen for the great service you provided. Two years ago another company suggested we needed to buy a new unit and you saved the day. It's still going strong two years later (a 15 year old unit) and your honesty and great service are much appreciated.
5	I highly recommend Daylan and crew. Have used them personally and recommended them professionally.
5	I recently had my AC unit downstairs stop cooling. I contacted another company and they came out and told me I had a refrigeration leak in the attic and that it would cost me almost $2,000 to fix it. Obviously I wasn't happy that I had to spend that kind of money so I asked for recommendations from contacts at work and was referred to Dalen. Dalen was professional, informative and thorough. He came over the next day and found that the problem was the txv valve. He found no leak.,,,he ordered the part and installed it for much less than $2,000!!!! Dalen's number is now programmed in my phone and will only be calling him for any heating/cooling issues. He knows his stuff!!! You won't be disappointed!!
