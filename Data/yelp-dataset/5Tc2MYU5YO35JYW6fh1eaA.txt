5	I have not been to a boutique where the staff was more friendly or helpful.  I love how they treated everyone like a valued customer, even a humble college student like me at the time.  The sales ladies there really knew their jeans and made excellent recommendations on which jeans would fit my figure the best.  This place is one of the things I miss most since moving out of Pittsburgh.
4	I bought my first pair of designer denim here over 5 years ago, and have been hooked ever since.  7 For All Mankind Bronze Swarovski Crystal Pockets.  Fantastic experience.
5	I have been shopping at EB Pepper since it was in the Ross Park Mall (Well over 15 years ago!!) I have travelled to many cities, both in the US and abroad,  and I can honestly say that hands down this is my favorite boutique--no sloppy looks here, feminine, well-made, CHIC and gorgeous clothing--i even tried to shop here pregnant--If you need a cocktail dress or a rehearsal dinner dress OR an amazing suit..i just wish they would have a website...Love this place, always will!
