4	A very cute little place that works really hard.  I stopped in here for a snack the other day and found everyone here hard at work finishing some very beautiful cakes.  Now I've never special ordered anything from here but I just might the next time I have an event of some kind because the cakes looked and smelled amazing.  Much to my delight, they also sell snack sized items like strawberry bars, scones, and something called a "magic bar".  It wasn't exactly magical but it was very good.  Cookie base with chocolate chips and coconut, how could you go wrong.

After just one bite, I knew that this would be the place that I brought  my cakes from now on. They are all homemade pound cakes. They offer a wide variety of frostings and fillings to choose from.They brought our cake to the reception site and set it up for us. I was thoroughly pleased.
4	We actually ordered our wedding cake from here a while back, and since we were in the area, we thought we'd stop in and pick up a snack.  Most of the things that they make are simply special order cakes.But if you get there early enough, you can have a chance at some of the day's fresh items - usually there are cupcakes and cookies and the like.Just be warned that they aren't a standard bakery with rows and rows of things in cases.  You'll find a couple of small trays, and since they are made fresh daily, when they are gone, they are gone!
