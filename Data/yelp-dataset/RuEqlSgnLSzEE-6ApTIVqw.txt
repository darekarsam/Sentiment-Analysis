4	Decent size liquor store. They have a great selection of wine and most of the other liquor staples. If you need something specific, (in liquor, not wine), that is not common you may have trouble finding it.It's always very clean, organized, and plenty of helpful staff.
3	Location: Monkland village.Selection: Pretty darn good - it's what you'd expect from a liquor store. You'll find a good selection of wine and the hard stuff.Service: Meh. No one said hi, no one asked if they could help me or make a suggestion, and the cashier looked pretty damn grumpy. I gave it three stars because of their selection, and I found what I wanted and actually enjoyed it. Though, I can't praise them for the wine-making, can I?
3	It's okay. They have a decent selection of alcohol and tend to be the one location that carries a few of my favorites. Service is lackluster, with employees that seem tired and like they would rather be anywhere but here! No smiles, no help. Bah. I'm usually here on a mission, so I am not looking for help, just direct me to the bottles I'm looking for, and they will do that when requested.
