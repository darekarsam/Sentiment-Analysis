5	I ordered my wedding favors from truffle trolley and had a wonderful experience.First we ordered the truffle sample box to test out all the flavors. From this box we selected the Dark Chocolate Raspberry truffle, White Chocolate Champagne truffle, and Milk Chocolate Almond truffle as our favorites. We decided to go with the formal triple-truffle favors and ordered 200. We ordered about 4 months in advance from the website, and our favors arrived right on time.... beautifully packaged. They even packed them with ice packs to ensure they would avoid the heat.Our guest loved the truffles. I was told that several of them were looking on the bottom of the box, trying to find out who made them. We had a few extra boxes and ended up putting them on the guest-book table... they were all scooped up.Overall my I would 100% recommend truffle trolley. The truffles were good, the price was great, and honestly do you want to have to tie ribbons on your own favor the night before... I think not.
2	I planned to order chocolate truffles from Truffle Trolley for our wedding favors.  We ordered the sample box to try them out.  They came in about a week and they were packed on ice which was really nice.  However, when we tried them, we just found them WAY too sweet!  We didn't like them so we are looking for something else.  Just make sure you try the chocolate before you buy to make sure you like it.

5	I ordered my wedding cake and boxed truffles for wedding favors from Truffle Trolley and could not have been more satisfied!  I just had my one year anniversary and per tradition had the top layer of the cake that had been frozen for the past year.  Still tasted great!
