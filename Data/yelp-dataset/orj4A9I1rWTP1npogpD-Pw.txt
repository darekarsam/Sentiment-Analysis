5	So much fun here!  We are learning excellent skills, but we are always having a good laugh and enjoying the time.  I spend all day working in front of a computer, so my body gets very stiff.  I leave the dojo feeling completely stretched out and my body feels better all week.  I'm so glad I found this place and I recommend it to anyone who has any interest in Aikido, Tai Chi, or simply needs a new fun way to get out of a seated position!
5	Angus is an excellent instructor.  He's very patient and obviously knowledgeable about what he teaches.  Besides techniques, he also has a vast store of knowledge based on experience that makes his classes truly comprehensive and applicable to the real world.  And on top of all that, he's a great guy who makes training fun.
5	The new dojo is great. They thought a lot about the mat and it feels good on the feet and it's almost enjoyable to fall. Definitely one of the best in town, if not the best.Angus teaches non-traditional aikido and tai chi, and his style of teaching is very flexible and fun. It's a good way to de-stress after work and we're definitely learning valuable martial arts. Everyone who goes to class are also very nice people.
