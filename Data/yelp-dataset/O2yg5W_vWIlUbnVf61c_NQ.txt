4	Let's get the bad news out of the way first - The pasties at this wee stall in Waverly Train Station are probably double the price you'll pay at Greggs.The good news is - they usually taste at least ten times better than Greggs. The pastry is more golden and flaky and the fillings have more depth and flavour. On a sunny day, you can also come out of the station, cross the road and enjoy your pasty within the peace and tranquility of Princes St Gardens. You might want to pick up a fork to keep the pigeons at bay though. Once they get a sniff of your steak and ale pasty, they're bound to want a bite themselves.
4	I've never been to this stall before guessing that they where pretty expensive but what the hell there must be less calories in a pasty than a KFC, ordered my pasty with a smile but that soon disappeared when the till went ding paying with a five pound not there was not a lot of change left for the bus fare. The pasty was nice but left me trying to work out the GP% that they where making, must have been a lot. This kiosk is expensive but probably worth it.
3	Didn't have a lot to compare to, but it worked fine for a quick breakfast to take on the train. Had the traditional cornish beef pasty. Served hot and fresh. Nice for a quick grab and carry. Can we bring one of these back to the states?
