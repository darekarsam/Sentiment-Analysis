5	I have been a customer for 1.5 years.  The Take Paws team walks my dog 4 times a week.  Wonderful folks. Very professional and reliable, and that is key since dog walkers enter your home when you are not there, and watch out for your best friend(s).  They communicate regularly and have procedures for emergencies.  Good folks!
5	Take Paws has been wonderful.  They walk my 4 legged babies twice a week.  They are prompt, patient, flexible and you can tell that they love animals!  I work long hours and it gives me such peace of mind to know that I have someone so caring to come and spend time with them so they are not alone all day.
5	Caitlin is the best! She is 100% reliable and my dog loves her. She has been flexible and always gives me a report of how my pup did on the walk. Unlike other companies I tried, take paws actually walks my dog. They really spend time with him. Take Paws has been walking my dog for about 6 months and I could not be happier with the service.
5	The Take Paws crew is simply amazing!  I work as a consultant, and have a fairly hectic travel schedule, and everyone is accommodating, flexible and responsive. Even more than their ability to adapt to my schedule, through the last year of using their services they have proven to be upstanding, honest and trustworthy - all very important qualities for people you allow in your home.  In short - I couldn't recommend their services more. For any current resident - look them up.  Considering moving to Madison, and need a dog walker - look no further, these folks will treat you right.
1	Incredibly disappointed with Take Paws. We had a wonderful dog walker initially through them, but when she left for another job our next dog walker had minimal experience being around dogs and was unable to walk our 2 dogs at once.  We are currently looking for another dog walking service.
