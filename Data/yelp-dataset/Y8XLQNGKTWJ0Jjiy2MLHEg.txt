3	Lots of salespeople, day and night. Great place to shop for a 2nd hand Hyundai Accent or similar model. The process is pretty painless and they clean the car well before selling it to you. I had one little issue with the hood lever and so I brought it to the Service Centre the next day and they repaired it under the guarantee. Buying a used car is always a tricky ordeal however. This is my first time with Hyundai, drove a Toyota Yaris before. Car is smaller and lower and about the same on gas (600 km to a tank). We'll see about the durability in the next few years.
