3	LOVE the sesame seeds crust, just the right texture and crispyness, though I suspect its made with shortening. The sauce is good, avery honest marinara and the price is quite all right. My only hick-up would be the quality of the cheese. There is a weird, sort of non-dairy after-taste to it (you'll see what I mean if you order the regular, just cheese and sauce version) other than that, seriously, in Verdun its pretty much the best.
5	Great pizza with real ingredients, not soggy at all and fantastic prices! Two for one pizzas and drinks, its fantastic. Delivery is fast and the staff is extremely friendly. 100% recommend!
4	Ok, I am not gonna go overboard and say that it is some of the best pizza I have ever had...C'mon I live in Montreal. But, that being said, it is some tasty pizza. They are well priced and the pizza is far from being bad; In fact, ask for sesame seeds on the crust and you will be pleasantly surprised. Definitely, a fair pizza for a fair price!
