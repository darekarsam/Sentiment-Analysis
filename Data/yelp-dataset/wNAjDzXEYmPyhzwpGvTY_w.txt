5	A Yelper friend suggested that we should hang out here before a Yelp event and I'm happy we did. The Cafe's name is moderately amusing at first but then it gets outright comical. So many Mustache puns can be had.I went with a cappuccino, paid at the cash and sat down on the very large community table where a dozen patrons or so can sit down and enjoy their orders. There are also many smaller tables around the bigger table if you're the introverted type. The Cafe is small but the environment is warm and intimate. The decorations on the wall are obviously coffee related with the possibility of purchases such as coffee beans, coffee equipment and so forth.The Cafe offers a variety of coffees and treats that was duly noted by my part for future visits. Everything is... well Mustache related and looked good. A few minutes later I got my cappuccino and I'll admit, it was quite excellent.We sat down and chatted until we left, with the warm embrace of Moustache Cafe trailing behind us.Oh and the FREE WIFI password is AMAZING.
5	ok, it needs an update.this place is extremely charming! the little things are what make it a 5 stars for me. from Jays, the lovable mascot (dog) to the awesome logo and mug to the tv playing cartoons to the incredibly funny wifi password. there's nothing to not like about this place!where else can you drink a coffee, study, have a conversation going and pet a dog for as long as you want and all that, at the same time?and the owners and baristas? awesome and extremely friendly!and its not like you need another reason to spend time here but they do have an art gallery. on their walls, they display a local artist work for a couple of months where you can enjoy looking at and who knows, might be interested in buying some.excuse me while i go pet Jays again..
