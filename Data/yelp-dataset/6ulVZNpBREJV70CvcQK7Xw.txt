I have recommended Adam to several people and I will continue to do so.

5	I have done business with RMR for over a year and have nothing but good things to say about them.  They come on the scene when life couldn't be worse because of flooding or fire damage.  They handle themselves professionally and compassionately to solve problems and make life better, quicker with no hitches.  They just come in and take care of the mess and all the paperwork the accompanies it.
5	I had a big leak in my house I just bought, and found a bunch of mold. Rocky Mountain came right over and took care of it. They dealt with the insurance company and made the entire process easy. I would use these guys from now on. Completely professional!
5	Had a water heater go out. The Rocky Mountain Restoration team got my home looking back to normal in no time. Very grateful for their help.
