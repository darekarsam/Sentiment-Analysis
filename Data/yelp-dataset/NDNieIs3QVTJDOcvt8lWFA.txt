5	I've had Checklist out to inspect both of my home purchases.  John is very informative and helpful in explaining any potential issues with the home no matter how big or small.  In my last inspection, there were some very minor issues in the home that he said were easier for him just to fix them rather than write up in his report.  He's happy to answer any additional questions that come up even after the inspection is over.  Just like with the first reviewer, he checked my irrigation system which isn't required for the home inspection when closing on a house.If you are purchasing a home, I would highly recommend Checklist!  They are very professional, informative and helpful.  I give them an A+ for customer service.
