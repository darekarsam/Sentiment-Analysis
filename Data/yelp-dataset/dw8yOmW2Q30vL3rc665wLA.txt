5	Vlads is the best barber here in phoenix!..
5	The best !!! Been coming to vlad's for 10 years now !!!
5	I go to Lex. There's 3 barbers, he's the last one on the end. I bring my son in & his fades are always on point. Great with blending & hair looks good no matter what I have him do. I've also had the guy in the middle cut his hair as well & he did a great job as well. Great trio cutting hair.Lex left, I go to the guy that took his seat, I don't know his name, but he's very good & doesn't rush at all. NO issues. But you might be waiting a while if he has a person or two in front of you.You might want to go to the girl, if you don't mind her practicing on you. Anytime I've been in there with my son, the bald guy that owns shop has to come & fix SOMETHING.
5	I love this shop, I go to Carlos or Vlad. Quick, great and affordable haircuts. What else can you ask for?
