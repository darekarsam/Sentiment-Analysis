5	Maria photographed our annual charity event for SNIFF AZ that benefits spay/neuter in Maricopa County. We could not have been happier with the unique and inspiring photos she took. We can proudly show future attendees what fun they will have if they attend next year. Loved each and every shot. She really captured the essence of the event and the folks who made it all possible - our attendees
5	Maria is a fantastic photographer to work with. I was lucky enough to book a boudoir session with Maria. She made the shoot very comfortable for me and had a lovely set for the back drop. She captured some amazing shots and my pictures turned out great!
5	We hired Maria for a corporate evening event of about 150 people to capture groups using a green screen. The people liked how interactive and friendly she was. She was great at staging the groups and ensuring that every person was photographed well. The photos came out great! We couldn't have been happier with her work.   Corporate Training Executive.
