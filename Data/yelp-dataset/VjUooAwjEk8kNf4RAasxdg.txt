4	Latino food in Durlach.\Well, unlike t'other reviewer, I didn't go into the kitchen, so I can only review this from a consumer point of view. Which, in short, was: yum! Two friends and I ate early and outside; service was prompt and friendly, the beer was cold, and the food was tasty. I had the chicken burrito, which I found very nice -- plenty of cheese, a good balance of chicken to other ingredients, and the Bohnemus (bean paste) was dense but flavorful. The boyfriend had the mixed quesadillas and seemed to really enjoy them. The patatas bravas to start with were also yummy.Food presentation is slightly chi-chi (or schicki-micki as they say here in Germany), and the prices are slightly higher than your average pub fare to match this, but I regretted nothing; we had a very pleasant meal. Also, in reference to the other review -- as an ex-waitress, all I can say is that if I were to go into restaurant kitchens all the time, I'd never eat out again. Almost all kitchens are somewhat appalling; it's best to just receive one's food and try to enjoy it without thinking too hard about where it came from. You know, like you should when eating an egg.
