4	Ate with Marc D. and he nailed it. My previous experience was just as good. My parents had just flown into town so it made 3 of us.  I was starving but my parents weren't so the restaurant allowed is to get just 2 orders of the tasting menu...bizarre, I know.  The menu consists of amuse bouche, choice of entree, main and dessert. They brought out what must have been 6 courses - spanning almost every dish on the menu - over 3 plates each! Very unexpected! Then they "offered" us a glass of dessert wine  from Quebec gratis since they can't sell alcohol. It was a quiet weeknight granted but they went above and beyond. My parents and I felt truly cared for. It's my new standby bistro.
5	I came here with my family and I have to say it was the most delicious French food I have had in my four years in this city, including at l'Express. The waitress was adorable and assisted us Anglos with our orders, and helped us satisfy even my little sister's picky appetite. The foie gras was to die for and the venison with a type of chocolate sauce, which she said had been cooking for three days, was also delectable. The atmosphere is cute and bistro-like, and it was a pleasant place to eat. We will definitely be back.
4	Excellent food but very slow service. Waited for 20 min between each course. The carte blanche was great but the chef menu is sufficient to be satisfied.
