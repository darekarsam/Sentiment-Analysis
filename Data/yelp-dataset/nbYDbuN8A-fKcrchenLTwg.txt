5	Athlea is a part of the great Banana Republic Empire. Which may actually be part of the great Gap Empire. I really do not know who is the grand Pooba here. But, anyway you get the jest.You can use any of your Empire Credit Cards here. As well as the traditional Visa and Master Card. As well as American notes as well. Not sure about checks.Anyway, the merchandise is good quality , as is the high prices. But, along with the high prices you also get some other good perks.They are a good company, been around now for a long time.(The Empire). You can get anything hemmed complementary, which is awesome. You can bring anything back with the receipt. Even better, if you order something from them on line and for some reason do not like it. You can take it back to the store with your receipt. You have to love these little things that make one's life easier, I know I do.I do like the products they sell. Everything is quite well made and very comfortable.They are open 7 days a week as well.It is located in the Kierland Commons, so parking can at times be a bit dodgy.
4	I have been going to the Athleta store in Portland and I was happy to see the one in Kierland open last year.  I love their yoga pants more than any of their other products.  So far, I have 4 pairs, 2 long and 2 capris, the other bonus is that they are not see thru, I checked, don't asked me how.   The only downside is that they are never on sale like other store (hint, hint, across the street).  I am glad I can at least use my rewards points to make them more affordable.
