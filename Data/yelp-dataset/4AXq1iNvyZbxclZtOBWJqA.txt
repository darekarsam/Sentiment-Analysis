4	Boardwise is a spot on, cool ass store of surf, skate and snow wear, hidden away slightly on Lochrin Place, but easy to find once you know where it is, obviously. A brilliant shopping gem to have some knowledge of if you're very good at any of the sports mentioned, or just very cool, either of the two options will do.The shop is laid out over some fairly extensive premises, and filled with sporting goodies of an advanced level, and as usual when I'm in a shop surrounded by clothing that's a million times cooler than I am, I just stand looking in awe of all the sexy plus gnarly ski jackets, which are impossibly out of my price range anyway. Although if you do come along here when the sales are on, you can absolutely grab something bargainous. You'll find tons of brands here, including Analog, Animal, Billabong, Special Blend and Addict Clothing, in menswear, ladies wear and children's sizes.
4	Visiting here with a surfing enthusiast I was impressed with what he claimed was a bargain buy. Boardwise do well to compete with online companies and they successfully add  well informed advice and tips with your every purchase. In an attempt to persuade me to get into surfing a particularly chatty member of staff enlightened me of the best places to surf in Scotland alongside offering affordable rental prices for all the basic gear. A nice gesture.I you like anything involving a board, you'd be wise to go here. (cringe)
