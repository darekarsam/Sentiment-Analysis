5	Nice selection of scrubs and excellent customer service!
4	"You'll be required to wear a white lab coat", in my brain translates to, "You'll have to go to work in a shapeless sack that will make you look like a marshmallow with legs".  Nooooo!After calling multiple places that sell lab coats, but don't have a single one in stock for you to try on, I came upon this place. They had 4 different styles of lab coats in stock, ready to be modeled, lol.  I found 3 that where cinched at the waist 'YAY!!" and 2 fit, so I walked out a happy camper. If I must look like a marshmallow, it will be like a marshmallow with a waist & plenty of pocket space :)Added bonus: This place has extended hours & on most days closes at 9 pm!  Check their website for the exact days.
4	Came in and got all the help I  could need and found what I was looking for. nice clean store.
5	Went here today,friendly and quick service with a lot of availability for males.On top of the fact that's it conveniently located right off the 101 and Northern. Recommending indeed.
5	Service was beyond excellent! The 2 ladies who helped me were just the sweetest! I came in looking for a specific color of scrub pants for my uniform, and they helped me pick the size and everything. I will definitely go back when I decide to purchase more scrubs!
5	The service here was excellent! The two ladies who were working made sure I found the right size and fit, and there was a sale on some scrubs so I ended up going with those ones. I love what I bought! I will definitely be shopping here in the future. They have a great selection.
4	Lots of selection and reasonable prices. They have a lot of the popular brands in a lot of different colors and sizes. If you prefer to buy your scrubs in person or you want to try on in the store to see if the sizing fits, this is a good scrub store to visit in the area.
