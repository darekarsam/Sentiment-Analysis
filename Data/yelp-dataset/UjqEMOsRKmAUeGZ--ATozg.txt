4	Great service.
5	The brothers run a nice UPS Store. Both are friendly and knowledgeable and will provide you competitors' rates -- which is something other UPS Stores don't do because they want your $$$. I highly recommend this store if you're on the East side.
5	Brothers own this, and they are both very nice and helpful!
5	Customer Service doesn't get much better than this!! The brothers know many on a first name basis and really engage in dialogue to make your service a better experience!!Print jobs can get rather complicated, however, they're more than willing to assist with instruction and do what they can to insure you have the end product you needed.I'm a repeat client for the service!! Highly recommended!
