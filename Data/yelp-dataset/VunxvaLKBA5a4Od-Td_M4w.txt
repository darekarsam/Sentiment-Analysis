4	This is one of my wife's favorite place to shop, we can be here for hours if we don't watch out!!! Neat place, find things you don't normally find anywhere else. Prices can be high at times! Employees are always nice, and helpful. When you go, do not forget their coupons!!! you can't miss them!
4	This is where all the "As seen on TV" items live! You will also find lots of hard to find things in general :)This place is set up warehouse style, but very well organized. I especially like the color coordination ;D My only gripe would be the checkout process. There were checkout lines, but all were closed. The people at the Customer Service 'cubicle' (for lack of a better word) were checking everyone out, which is OK, but there is nowhere to form organized lines... that makes me crazy, lol.
