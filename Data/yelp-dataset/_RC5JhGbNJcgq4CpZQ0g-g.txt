3	I attended a reception at this lovely venue, beautifully decorated and very spacious and even provided childcare.  The food was not consistent, which is never good for a reception.  The crab dip appetizer was good but the she crab soup was very watery, the entree of chicken and fish with veggies was just ok.  This is such a great venue for a reception but they would be exceptional if they could put more attention into the food.
4	I go for Golf.  The Longview Course is beautiful and well maintained.  I only give it 4 Stars because I have not eaten in the restaurant enough to give it a fair score.  It's "Bar Food"; and a lively atmosphere when I went.  If your goal is golf; it is one of the best Semi-Private spots around with a Classy Course. Snack Bar needs to have a bit better selection; more than hot dogs and 'gas station' sandwiches.
4	Great food, excellent service and affordable prices. The servers even brought out ice water for my dog! If I lived closer to Tega Cay, I would hit up their golf club restaurant regularly. I'm not a golfer, but I've heard the course is pretty tough and well maintained and the prices are affordable. I'm definitely recommending this to my husband for future golf outings.I ordered the sushi and was pleased with the quality and how quickly the order came out!They also have an excellent beer selection!
3	I was here for a wedding, so I can't speak for the golf course or overall club grounds.  Overall the facilities seemed nice.  It was not great weather on the day of the wedding, and had the rain not stopped between the ceremony and reception for a bit, I'm not sure how we were supposed to get from the covered porch where the wedding was to three buildings down where the reception was taking place.  The food was okay for it being buffet style in a large quantity.  They had penne noodles with garlic and parmesan, but the noodles were cold, and the wait staff did not seem thrilled to be there.
