5	Amazing.  Can't believe I'm the first to write a review for this place.  The atmosphere was charming and the food was out of this world.
5	Outstanding! While visiting Montreal for a week, we ate at a lot of great restaurants, but this was one of the best! The place is small, and the chalkboard-only menu changes every night, but whatever is on there will be worth the visit. If you're in the Plateau du Mont-Royal area, make sure you put this on your list!
3	Small and warm place. Menu written on boards. I was there on a cool night and the place and food was very soul warming. The place is long and narrow, therefore quite noisy. Good ingredients, interesting wine list. The 4 of us really enjoyed our meals. For such a fine bistro, I would say the only downside is the high prices.
