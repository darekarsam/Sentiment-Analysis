5	Best pizza in the 'Burg! They definitely don't skimp on the cheese and the sauce is awesome....it has a fresh tomato taste to it that goes well with the crisp, nutty crust.
5	This pizza is a classic!  If you visit Pittsburgh, you have to try it.  The shop is not big on "ambiance."  It is a casual little pizza shop with a few tables, very small, very VERY informal.  But, man is that pizza great.  I love the sauce!
5	This is awesome pizza. Seriously. Nice and cheesy with an outstanding crust. Good pasta items that are served in huge portions. I order can be split between two people, really. But the pizza is the star here. Totally love it! And the staff is wonderful. Note: they don't take cards (maybe checks?). I found out the hard way. When I tried to pull money out of the ATM in the shop, I entered the wrong PIN number and was "locked out" of my account. They let me take the food and told me to come by tomorrow and pay. Who does that?!? Some of the best pizza I've ever had. Just as good when eaten as leftovers!!!
5	Mineo's is by far my favorite pizza ever!!! I've been eating a Mineo's ever since I was a little kid.  We used to walk to Mineo's for our lunch from Washington Elementary School and have our slices of pizza and of course some ice cream for dessert!  It's a great place to go for lunch or even late at night!  I love how you can get pizza by the slice or order a whole pizza if you want.We always get Mineo's take-out for our Steelers parties or if we're just craving some great pizza of course!  I love the people that work there too.  They're always really friendly.Probably my only complaint about this place is that they only take cash.  Sometimes we don't end up ordering from here if we don't happen to have cash on us.  However, this usually doesn't stop us!  I'm a Pittsburgh native, but I've lived in LA for a year now, and I'm always craving Mineo's!  Every time I'm back in Pittsburgh I have to get some!! Definitely the best pizza ever!!  I highly recommend this place!
5	I have never had a pizza that inspired me as much as Mineo's.  I have had it on speed dial for over 10 years now.  The Sq. Hill location is the endpoint for the majority of my hard earned childhood paper route money.  Today, if my family is eating pizza we are eating Mineo's.  For my money there is no better. I will add a caveat.  I don't categorize chicago deep dish pies or "gourmet" pies with what you get at Mineo's.  For a more "gourmet" pizza the offerings across the street at il Pizziaolo are excellent (proscuitto and arugula pizza is a stunner).  I also don't count the sicilian square old-forge stuff either.  Mineo's is the best of what I would call a traditional pizza.  The crust is tremendous.  Just the right amount of crispy and chewy.  Sauce is succulent.  If there is any room for criticism it is that there is a TON of cheese.  I don't consider this bad, however.Expect to be parched after you eat Mineo's.  I always like a Dr. Pepper or Diet Cherry pop with it.Also, if you eat in the place is BYOB which is cool.  The staff is always nice to my kids too.
4	I like to get Mineo's pizza as a treat, it's not an everyday pizza for me.  Of course, I grew up eating a thin crust pizza and that's still my favorite kind.The crust is really yummy, the cheese is thick and delicious, and I love the pepperoni - it's very flavorful.The white pizza with spinach is also really good.I've had the Italian sub and it's good, the flavors are a little bit different from what I'm used to.As for service, I've never had a problem with the staff.  They typically aren't happy-go-lucky people, but they have always been cordial when I've been there.  I don't expect table service in a pizza place usually, that's not a standard where I grew up so I'm used to it.
4	Not a lot of places in Pittsburgh do Sicilian pizza. Mineo's does it well. Do not overestimate how much you can eat-- one piece is probably the equivalent of 2 slices of regular pizza. I actually like their sauce, and the cheese is good. If anything there's too much cheese!The restaurant itself is kind of shabby. I don't look too closely at the floor and doubt the grated cheese ever sees the inside of a fridge, but it's nice to have this place within walking distance for a quick slice of pizza. The fact that they have ice cream makes it a good place to take kids, too.
4	One of my favorite pizza places.  Yay, I am a fan!  Walk in and notice a nice aroma and usually get a hello from the guys working.  Have been told that the ingredients are fresh even the sauce is homemade and the I like the sauce flavors, although not to spicy and a nice tomato taste.  I think the cheese may be one of the reasons it is so good.   This is not a NY or Chicago style, a crust that is tasty and a thin medium (is there a thin medium?) and a nice texture with a crispy crust edge.  Mineo's seems to put more cheese on then many pizza places and usually I don't want a lot of cheese but it works at Mineo's.  Sometimes the cheese seems to get a little greasy looking but not today, and it is always good.   The pepperoni slices are thicker and very tasty.  Cash only but an ATM on sight.
4	Stopped in for a couple quick slices of plain red sauce.  $1.60 each.  They were really great.  I loved the sauce, some of the best I have had.  I sprinkled some oregano over and it was great.  It was short of greatness, however, because of the amount of cheese.  Way too much and really hard to get down.  I would definitely go back and order a pie with 1/2 the amount of cheese and some toppings.  Some may love the cheese but I, like Darren, found it overwhelming.
3	Terrible service. Decent pizza.
4	Consistently great pizza. Although the Sicilian doesn't blow my socks off, everything else is superb.
5	I had lived in Oakland for so long as a student that I kind of forgot that Mineo's was still around; I'm ashamed that I did. This was one of my favorite places as a child, and now Mineo's is my favorite place to grab a snack after a long day of work in a shop down the street. This place is not only cheap, it is outright delicious - everything is made fresh to order and in my experience comes out piping hot and cooked to perfection. If I want a single piece of pizza with a weird combination of toppings, they'll get it ready for me, no problem! Definitely one of the best pizza places around, even if you need to deal with things like paper plates (admittedly not the best thing to use when trying to eat pizza fresh out of an oven). The seating isn't exactly fancy, though, but for quick eats, it works - it's clean, cozy, and decent.
3	Overall: One of Pittsburgh's better pies, but definitely for eating only on premise. Better service than Aiellos, but the pie is heavier, greasy, and not as fresh. Come here on occasion, but Aiellos wins across the board.____________________________________________Ambience: (3/5). Dim lighting, dingy pizza parlor table-tops, and framed accolades and family photos turn this into a pizza den. Crowded, booth-only dining area save for the stools for the island in the middle. The front counter is the kitchen, so you'll leave smelling like pizza.____________________________________________Service: (3/5). Rushed but pleasant. The 10+ people behind the counter swap in and out, delivering pies and taking orders. It's cafeteria style, vending machine included, and you do have to give them your dirty tray. ____________________________________________Drinks: (1/5). Soda, and nothing special. Ice cream is served next door.____________________________________________Food: (3/5). An experience in excess, and if you want grease and cheese, this is it. The cheese is thicker than the crust, slides off at least 50% of the time. 2-3 paper plates are soaked at the end of a pepperoni.. spicy and occasionally burnt. Crust is thin and absorbs a large amount of grease. The sauce is occasionally burnt on, otherwise thin, thankfully salty. Pepperoni or mushroom are good bets here, as are onion and sausage. You DO NOT need extra cheese.
3	Been going to Mineo's for the longest time I can remember. Good pizza but certainly not the best one around town! Cash only though!
5	The pizza is amazing! Be careful when ordering the toppings are usually under the cheese so if you do a half and half because of a picky person you may not see the toppings.
3	Cheese overload! I usually get extra cheese, but decided not to this time. It ended up coming out with a ton of cheese. It made the pizza too heavy to pick up and extra greasy. The topping just slid off. I actually had to pick some off. It is bit my favorite, but would probably go back and get light cheese next time.
5	Just as good as Sq. Hill location.  Mineo's is as good as it gets.  The pies are straightforward and not fancy.  No reason for them to be.  This location is also byob - bonus!
5	Great pizza, our new go to pizza place. Always satisfies our craving.
3	Not quite as good as the Squirrel Hill location, but quick service. Would recommend the Sicilian Pizza over the usual style.
1	Horrible.  Tried it several times.  Taste like frozen Pizza.  Found a hair in it the first time so against my better judgement tried it again.  I swear it was worse than my first experience.  The locals that like this joint must have smoker destroyed taste buds.
5	Just as good... Dare I say... maybe better than the squirrel hill location (gasp)Ricotta, mozzarella, and roasted red bell peppers... that's all you need to know
4	My dad raves about this place and always encourages me to stop in. I finally gave in and stopped through one day on my way home from studying at Uptown. I ordered 2 slices of pepperoni to go for less than $5. I was sad that they didn't have an actual pepperoni pie; they just slapped pepperoni on the plain slices and tossed it in the over. That's my only complaint. When I got home, I was really excited to get to chewing. The bottom crust was crunchy and good (I couldn't eat the end bits of crust because it was a little hard). The pepperoni was authentic, thick, and spicy. The pizza was super greasy and cheesy, but flavorful and delicious. I will be trying again when I have the cash in my pocket.
