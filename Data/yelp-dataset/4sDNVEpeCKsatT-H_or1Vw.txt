4	Open Sundays,  even though it says closed.  This is definitely a hole in the wall bar in the back of a strip mall but my dad swears they have the best burgers.  Very small,  very dark interior,  but friendly staff and excellent food and cheap beer.  I love a good bar especially the food. And dad was loving his burger. We will be back.  They have specials daily.  Nothing fancy,  just good food!
2	Small little bar in a strip mall. Good place for beer and watching the games. Nothing fancy. Kareoke on weekends if your into that. A couple of regulars are always there.
