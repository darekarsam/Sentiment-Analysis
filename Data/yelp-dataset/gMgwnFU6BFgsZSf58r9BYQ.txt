5	Went last night for the first time. Loved the food, loved the place as did all the people who packed the place.
5	Trattoria Cinecita is fabulous! When I say the word "delicious" I am not referring exclusively to the food, but rather inclusively to the the way the Manager George Benchimol textured the entire meal with genuine warmth and expert service! As a foodie I would recommend this restaurant to all, but the dining experience was made truly extraordinary by the leadership. Bravo! A real find!
5	Very friendly staff... good collection of wines, fresh and tasty food! cool and classic decoration! that's all you want from a restaurant. Check their promotions as well!
