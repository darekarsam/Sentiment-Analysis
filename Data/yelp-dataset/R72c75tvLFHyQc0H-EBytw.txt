5	Dr. Oplinger and his staff have done more for my family by caring for my dogs than they will ever know.  Besides the best care I have ever received for my dogs, his office charges are far less than half what I had to pay the last place I lived.
5	I have two dogs and live in the desert.  During the current Monsoon season my dog licked a poisonous toad and started vomiting.  Not only did Dr. Oplinger help me through this very difficult and confusing time (my dog kept vomiting and wouldn't eat for almost a week) he returned my call after-hours and followed up throughout the ordeal.  I feel very confident having Dr. Oplinger as my Vet as he's carying and compassionate and understands how important our pets are to us as they are part of our family.
