5	Where do I start?!I love this place!!!  This place serves both vietnamese and thai food - two of my favourite cuisines!  I have visited this restaurant several times and also had the pleasure of tasting my friends' dishes as well.First off, they serve the best Bun Bo Hue I have ever tasted in a restaurant.  Every time I visit a vietnamese restaurant, I order the Bun Bo Hue and 99% of the time, I am disappointed.  Fortunately, the Bun Bo Hue at Tuong Lai is FABULOUS!!!!Other favourites include:  shrimp tempura, grilled chicken, yellow chicken curry (VERY YUM), and red shrimp curry.The restaurant is beautifully decorated with really flattering lighting - making it a great "date" restaurant.Service was excellent.  Waitress was attentive, efficient, and really cute.
5	Yup, my cousins and I all agree that this place has the best Bun Bo Hue!!!  I have never tried the pho here but I actually don't think they are known for their pho ... even though their name is Pho Tuong Lai.  If you like your Bun Bo Hue spicy, you'll have to mention that upfront to the wait staff, otherwise, you won't get very much spice/ heat.  My brother really liked the Pad Thai - according to him it was the best Pad Thai he's ever had.  I've never been a huge fan of pad thai - more of a pad kee mao girl - so no comment from me!  :)p.s. There are high chairs available for use - a seemingly rare find for Vietnamese restaurants in Montreal.
4	Great food. Reasonable prices on combo for two. Very nice family staff. We loved if and steamed won tons in peanut sauce were excellent.
4	Not much selections during lunch hours, only one pho choice and the rest are stir-fry dishes. The Spring Roll was delicious and the Beef Pho was wonderful, savory broth that was refreshing at the same time.The ambience was a little weird, Asian decor with 80's disco music playlist in the background.The owners were very friendly and the service was excellent.
