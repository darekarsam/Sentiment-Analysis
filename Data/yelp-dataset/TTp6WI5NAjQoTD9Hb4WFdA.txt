5	I have been going to see Dr. Darrel Haggard for the past couple months and I could not be happier. He takes the time to actually figure out what your issues are and come up with solutions for the problems. His system isn't designed to keep you coming back for forever. He designs a plan that can help solve the issues you are having. My back and neck have improved drastically since I started going to Dr. Haggard. I really can't thank him enough. He is also a great individual who truly cares about his patients. I would recommend him to anyone. I haven't worked with his son, but you can tell he is the same way too and I've seen him with clients and he treats them amazing! If you need a chiropractor that you can trust...this is the place to go!
5	I've been coming here for 2 years. The best decision I've ever made! Both Dr Joe and Dr Darrel are super good and super nice. I've recommended a lot of my family members and friends here and they keep coming back. Other chiropractors I've been too have not helped me the way the Haggard's have, they've become like family to me and treat me like I am family. They go the extra mile for me and stay late if I need them too. I love it here and I will never move out of state because I don't want to be too far from them!!
5	Dr. Darrel and Dr. Joe are incredible healers!  They take the time to listen, diagnose, and treat my pain!  I feel 100% now after being seen by them. I highly recommend them. Not only are they excellent healers but caring and engaging professionals. I love these guys!
