4	Barcelos combo table d'hote portions are very filling and customers leave satisfied. I ate the chicken leg and lamb chop combo and found them both to be packed with taste but a little on the dry side. My fellow diners reported the same impression.I'll definitely give them some more tries as I think this restaurant has got potential and is reasonably priced with a pleasant atmosphere, albeit a little bit cramped.
