4	A friend suggested this place...It is a mexican/spanish-influenced furniture store with a great, well price selection of pottery, table ware, furniture and gift items. The selection is large and always changing. Also, the owners are in direct contact with many of the artisans, so if you want something in another color or finish, they can help you. I love the bright chairs emblazoned with Frida Kahlo imagery and the luminarias are the perfect, well priced hostess gift. A great place to get unique southwest decor that is more authentic than cheesy.
4	I like perusing this place! They have many colorful decor items, including furniture, sculptures, furniture, fabric, bobbing turtles...the list continues. I bought some decorative tiles on here for $1 each. These are unique and cheap gifts, a good place to go if you want to give someone an "Arizona" present.
3	I'm sad to find out that tlaquepaque is no longer in business. This was one of the places that we visited when we did not live here permanently. The owner was really nice and she was always ready to help.. I remember her because her name was Anna also.. I would like to know why did she close.? It seam like the store was busy.
