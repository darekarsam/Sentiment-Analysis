4	Best time to visit is during the week ~ Saturdays ate always very busy and the place is closed in Sundays.Appointment is usually required
5	This is a fantastic service. The women are obviously dedicated and really know how to handle even the fussiest of cats. Mine is a male and is not afraid to react if touched in the wrong place. She handles him marvelously. Not sure if they're non-profit but very professional. Just in case you've never had your cat groomed before, may I suggest that you do not get the belly shaved as it exposes his teats and he keeps lickig the fur around it. I will not get his belly shaved again, but they even clean the ears and shave the hair in between the toes on the paws. Try it you'll like it.
5	This grooming salon is specialized in cat grooming which makes this place a go-to if you have a cat. The owner and her employees(I think she has 1 or 2 part-time) are extremely nice and attentive. I get my cat shaved about 4 times a year (my love for my furry friend is greater than any allergy) and never encountered any problems. My wild lion is easily and gently tamed by the professional skills of Anne-Marie and her team!  It's worth driving all the way here if you're not in the area. If you're from the Sud-Ouest and you'd rather encourage local businesses, she also carries the Royal Canin food line and other treats. The only downer is they don't accept credit cards, only debit and cash. Price wise, similar to other places and will vary depending on your cat's behaviour, hair type, etc.
