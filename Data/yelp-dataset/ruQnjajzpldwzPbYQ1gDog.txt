4	Fun Place! Classic Bistro fare. Checkered floor, with huge war times lamps. Service was excellent. Very interesting wine list (all private imports; good selection by the glass). The ambiance is cool. It's a simple, very good menu. A bit out of the way, but in a very nice neighbourhood, with plenty of free and easy parking. Go there with your friends for a good times and good food!
