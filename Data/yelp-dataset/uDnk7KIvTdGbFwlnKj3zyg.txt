3	Had suprisingly good pub food here (buffalo chicken wrap). The fries were OK, not great. I thought the place was a lot nicer than I expected it to be and the patio looked really good too (didn't sit there though, it is October in Canada after all...). Didn't expect a lot honestly and was pretty happy in the end. Service and food delivery could definitely be a little faster. Note: this review was based on 1 visit.
2	The amount of time to receive drinks from the bar while sitting on the patio is very slow. We have been here for two hours and have only been served our 2nd drink. They need better/faster bartenders to remain competitive. We will take our patio business elsewhere this summer.
3	This place is pretty good, not bad pub fare. I come quite a bit for the wings specials, but the braised beef burger was amazing when I had it. Not many diffferent kinds of beers on tap though, but that's okay.The buffalo chicken wraps were mediocre, but again, I don't know how much more amazing a wrap can get.Great place to come with friends and watch a game, which makes the slightly higher prices tolerable.
