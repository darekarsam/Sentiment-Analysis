3	I had a very good experience with this Ramada. Every staff member I encountered was extremely kind and helpful. The place. Was clean, didn't smell funny and the bed was super comfy. They also provide a good number of thick soft pillows.There is a complimentary breakfast they call deluxe. Not sure I'd go that far as it was normal free breakfast fare like cereal, waffles and muffins. But still, better than nothing! All around it was a pretty nice place that I would stay at again.
3	This place was alright, for lack of a better word. The customer service is so-so, and the overall environment is so-so (as in it's not a fancy place with high standards for outward appearance). The bed was pretty comfortable (which is why it got 3-stars instead of 2), and the room is nice place to stay in for the night. The free breakfast is bad, so let's just leave it at that.  Overall, alright place to stay at for a night. Try to find somewhere else if you have time and money too
5	Nice rooms, and very friendly staff.
