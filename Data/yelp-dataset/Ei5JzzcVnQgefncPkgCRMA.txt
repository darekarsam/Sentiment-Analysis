2	These guys were really nice and seemed knowledgeable at first, but they sold us poor quality wood flooring at a jacked up price. We asked them to stop installing when we saw how it was turning out and they said, 'let's just get it installed and see what it looks like. We can talk about next steps from there...' Well, once it was all installed they said there was nothing they could do to remedy the situation and couldn't offer any discount. They also did a horrible job installing our carpet, though the carpet itself is great. We had to get another installer to come clean up their messy work. You can do much better than Wholesale Quality Flooring.
5	We are picky folks and found Wholesale Quality Flooring to meet our needs completely.  Our purchase was granite for kitchen and two baths.  It takes some time to figure out what you will be happy with long term, so don't hurry the process.Sales staff was knowledgeable and patient and our installer, Jonathan, was excellent. We will be returning to them for carpet.  That is the best recommendation that they could ask for.
1	Terrible! I think that is the only word I can use to describe them. They have someone who doesn't know anything answering the phones. I tried to schedule a in home estimate twice. Both times they did not show. I even confirmed 30 minutes before the appointment. I cannot imagine how terrible they must be after they have your deposit! I will be moving on to a professional company. I would not trust the good reviews on this company.
