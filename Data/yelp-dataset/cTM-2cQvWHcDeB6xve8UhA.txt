3	Ka-chunk. It's a CVS. Same aisles, same counters, same products. Some food items, personal care, cosmetics, over-the-counter and pharmacy. There is a drive-through.Staff is friendly, including the guy who made sure that what I was buying (a Vanilla Reload card) was what I really wanted. Lots of detail that he felt he needed to share with me that there was a previous customer who thought it was what she wanted and then it wasn't and they're apparently hard to return and now I've spent too much of your time on this story. Moving on...Access from Tryon or Steele Creek is fun because the store is in a strange corner of the shopping plaza.
4	This is actually a pretty nice CVS store. It's relatively new and is very well kept, with super friendly employees. I found everything I went in for easily. The shelves were all fully stocked and they had a nice selection of cards! I like the location; and since in in the Rivergate Shopping center, I'm sure to be back.
5	Just visited the minute clinic!! Quick, clean, and friendly! Now picking up my prescription!
4	A very busy CVS. just like most other CVS that you will go to. Clean and well run
1	The worst service ever! They told me a prescription wool be ready in 2 hours and I am still waiting and it has been 3 hours now. They have messed up with so many customers.
