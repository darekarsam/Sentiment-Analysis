5	The food is beyond amazing! Boustan is always my go-to place when I don't want to cook. Once, I accidentally put in an order in between my exams, and had to leave when they showed up. I called after coming back from my exam and the person was very nice about it. She sent the order out again without sounding irritated. I insisted that they charge me double but she said it was okay. Awesome service and amazing food.
3	The food here is good, but not great. This is the second branch opening, food is very flavorful, but some things like the garlic aioli are pretty heavy and oily. Great if you like that kind of food but not great if you don't, they have lots of small accompaniments which are pretty good.
5	Visit Montreal usually 2-3 times a year and what I like to call my "Street Food" is either Poutine (fries, cheese and gravy) or my favorite "Middle Eastern Cuisine place" BOUSTAN. Tabernac, it's just fantastic. First, the Chicken Shawarma Pita, tasty, medium hot with warm pita bred, on the side Garlic Potatoes, no question. Another great dish is the Beef Brochette with rice and coleslaw, wont fail. Have also tried the veggie dish, Vegetable Couscous. To my big surprise it was great too, really tasty, medium spicy. Have visit both places, Crescent and Catherine, same good food but different atmosfer, yours to discover. In short, great food, good price, quick service and always open. Appetitus noni.
