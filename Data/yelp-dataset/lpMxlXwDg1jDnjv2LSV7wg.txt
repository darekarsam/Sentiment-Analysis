5	Randy, the rep from First Impressions Security Doors came out today.  Very thorough and knowledgeable.  The prices are high but reflective of the quality.  Update to come after installation.WOW! They installed my gate FOUR days later! Looks great!
4	We used First Impression Security Doors twice in the past 6 months or so.   We had them put in a security door which looks amazing for the price.   We then had them put sun screens on our windows which also look great.I'd give it a 5/5, however the only thing that stops me from doing so was the installer was a little sloppy.    Was an extremely nice guy, but left two holes in the door (hard to see) due to bad cuts/measurements.
1	I ordered a security screen door from the company.  Since I  work during the week, I scheduled a weekend install for my door for when it was finally completed (they only install on Saturdays every other weekend).So 3 weeks later, I'm waiting for my installer who according to the person who had set up my appointment should have worked on my door from 8-10 am.  Around 10, I finally call the company because I'm tired of waiting and I understand sometimes things happen, but I'm told I was scheduled for that afternoon instead.  Of course I wasn't expecting that and had already made other plans for my afternoon!  Now it will be another 2 weeks for my door install because I rescheduled for a day when I could be home.  (They will do the install for you if you aren't home but my preference is to be there if I plan on spending more than a grand on a door!)If you choose to go with this company, you may want to call the day prior to confirm your appointment/install since I obviously wasn't on their schedule in the time frame given to me by whoever set up the installation.Good luck if you decide to use this company.  It will be a month for me to get my security door now!
5	I am very pleased with my security door.  I have to say, I have one of the most beautiful doors in my neighborhood!  I got a new design and wasn't sure how it would look, but it has exceeded my expectations!Our sales consultant was very helpful in the designing our door.  He offered options like a faux arch and a wreath hook.  We took our door to the next level with specific custom touches that nobody else will have.  It has been about six months since we had our door installed, and it has held up very well.  The door glides smoothly shut, and it slows down before it latches.  We receive many compliments on our door.  We also love that we can keep the front door open when the weather is nice!
2	just had a gate installed for my courtyard, if the company ever responds to my e-mail I will update this review.The sales person and myself visited a similiar home in the neighborhood that had a gate that was similiar to what I was looking for, the sales person said this isn't our gate but we'll do a much better job.So after a bit a negotiation we agreed on price, the installers didn't seem to know what they were doing, instead of using a stud finder they just kept drilling holes through the stucco hoping to find one...they thought they did but it turned out to be a cross brace and they didn't notice this until they had already shaved off about 1/2 inch of stucco then when they realized they hadn't hit a stud they decided to move the gate in about 3 inches and again shaved off more stucco.  The frame of the gate appears to be to big for the gate and it never looks like its closed all the way.They did patch some of the stucco but still left some drill holes and large gaps on the sides of the frame that should have been filled in.  I don't believe they ever did hit a stud and used another technique to secure the gate.Like I said if they make this right I will upgrade my rating but if I don't get a response, i'm going to the BBB and the ROC
2	UPDATE:  The company has been in touch with me to resolve this situation and are scheduled to make the repairs while i'm at the house next saturday.  I will provide another update once those repairs have been completed
3	The company did come out and make the necessary repairs, the gate looks pretty good now.
2	First Impressions make some beautiful screen doors & seem to have good customer service while going through the build process.My "First Impression" of my new door is sad :(My screen door build ended up a nightmare with multiple issues.I was contacted stating my door was done and was ready to ship out of state to me.But they built it with the wrong design and was kind of pushy trying to get me to accept it.After seeing pictures, It was not even close to what I signed off on and I refused the door.So, Now the second door gets built with the correct design,But instead of a whole new door, They cut pieces out of the incorrect door and added to it.Now I have 2 different powder coat colors between the door and the door frame.Upon installation,The door handle was damaged with two scratches.They sent the wrong lock cylinder.The channel for the mesh screen is crooked by 1/2" from one side to the other.And to top it all off, The door is out of square by 3/8", so it looks like crap with a huge gap between the door and frame.Their fix for this was to adjust the Z bar, but with it being off by 3/8" it is impossible to adjust it.So they decide to build me another Z bar and for me to re-drill it to take up some of the gap.I was also supposed to get some paint to touch up the end that needs to be cut.Well, I received the new Z bar, But they built it 3 inches too long.I guess I could cut it to size myself, But they failed to send me the touch up paint.Even if I closed the gap a little, How is one to fix the difference on the door ?I have not been contacted to see if my issues have been resolved, If I need any additional parts or anything!I was never sent a new door handle, correct lock cylinder or paint.So, To sum it up I have a $2,500 dollar multicolored, un-square, scratched door that rubs when closing and allows bugs/flies in with such a nice gap.I give them 2 stars simply because they do make nice looking products.I just wished they had competent employees who know how to use a basic machinist square.I don't think it's too hard to build a rectangle to fit inside a rectangle and to make it one single color !The quality is below sub par !Hell, The cheap, ugly $99 Chinese/Mexico screen doors have better quality control.I'll see if I get contacted now by someone with authority to either rebuild, replace or give me a refund!I notice the company replies mainly on the good reviews.If anyone cares to read the filtered reviews, You will see the mistakes on my door is not a one time incident, as others have had same/similar quality issues.If my door gets replaced/refunded, I'll be sure to update appropriately.***** UPDATE 6/14/2012 *****I was contacted by First impressions to try and resolve some of the issues I have with the door.They are working on getting a new door handle and the correct lock cylinder.They asked for multiple measurements and photos of the door to see the difference in the powder coat color between the door and frame and to see where the difference is to the gap/unsquare door.I'll be back to report any additional updates
3	With another round of First Impressions contacting me, They have come to the conclusion that the gap/unsquare door build is within their acceptable tolerances.Also the difference in powdercoat color between the door, frame and Z bars seem natural and acceptable to them as well.I'm being told that my color option "rustic iron" is custom mixed by them and this color is the ONLY finish that has this characteristic.If this is true, The customer should be WARNED while still in the ordering/building process & not left as a surprise!In a few days I am expecting some new hardware as we are going to try to shift the door frame to get an even gap.On the possessive side of things, They worked with me on getting the correct gap between the door and door frame on the hinge side.I had to remove the lower hinge, install the hinge screws in a second set of holes that were pre-drilled on the frame and drill 3 new holes in the door.I also received a new unscratched door handle set and the correct keyed deadbolt lock. I'll be back with more updates.********** UPDATE 7/5/2012 **********   3 stars now for First ImpressionsI received the new hardware which was sent very promptly.After several more phone conversations with First Impressions, I now have a proper gap between the door & frame.They have been more than helpful on resolving the fitment issues.Next on the list, they are going to try to resolve the fitment issues with the screen sashes.If/When the sash issues are fixed, All that would be left to resolve is the multicolored "Rustic Iron" powdercoat  variances between the door, door frame, Z-bars & expander.Again, I'll be back with more updates.
5	Well, most people that have used first impressions on Yelp are NOT accurate.  I was really happy with the service I received from them. I just did an addition and they were able to come out and get things done in a timely manner.  They have a large variety and I would recommend them.
2	I will not use First Impression again, we purchased a gate door and a front screen door from them. The workmanship appeared good when new, but they had the wrong type of lock that I needed, asked them to change it and they want extra money for it. We paid for it and they wanted the old lock back, I told the guy we paid extra for the new lock and he can't have it. Rust at bottom started to show after 3 years, I know powder coating is not rust free but they should not rust this quick. They were also the most expensive vendor out there when we were shopping around.
5	I just had an iron enclosure gate installed at my courtyard.  It is beautiful.  The salesperson was great to work with.  He was not pushy and did not try to upsell us.  We were told it would take 6-8 weeks for install, which we were not happy with, but felt that was beyond anyone's control.  To our surprise, we were called within a week of signing the contract and the install was scheduled for 4 weeks later.  The installer called promptly and had the gate installed within a few hours.  It looks so much better that I thought it would.  I got it for security purposes #1, but I'm so please at how beautiful it looks.
3	I gone to many places to look at doors for my courtyard. I also read reviews on all the businesses I had considered. Every place had good and bad reviews. I chose First Impressions because I was impressed with the quality of their doors. The sales associate Tracey was helpful, but seemed to have too much on his plate when I went into the showroom. He was busy with paperwork while he let me look at the iPad of samples. He said I could go to their website if I had any questions about any of the designs. I told him I would do some research and get back to him. I made a list of the styles I was interested in and emailed them to him and followed up with a phone call.  It took about a week before I heard back from Tracey with a quote. It was a bit higher than my planned on expenditure. He had an alternative that was very comparable and I decided to go with that style. On the day of the installation, the gate was incorrect. I had wasted a day taken off of work. Clay in the their service department contacted me immediately to resolve the issue. He had me scheduled for a week later and made the note to call me a half hour before arrival. I could not take another full day off of work. On the day of the second install, I never received a call and when I called to inquire, I was told the installer had installed the gate. What?! What if this was the first appt and he put the wrong door in? What about my re-key? We would have to make another appt for that. I cannot make another appt and continue to take time off of work. First Impressions had not given me the correct time frame to expect the installer and he never called. The lady on the phone was able to get the installer back later that day for the re-key.The next day I noticed holes in my stucco. The same complaints that are in the reviews about unnecessary holes. That was one of the reasons I wanted to be there for the install was to see how many holes needed to be drilled into my stucco. I cannot see behind the rails, who knows how many unnecessary holes are behind the rails. I called Clay again and told him about the holes and also some scratches that were on the lock. He dispatched the same installer and he filled in the holes and tried to touch up the scratch.It's been about 2 months now and I love the gate, it's solid and really beautiful and adds to the entrance of the home. I have noticed small rust areas where the welds meet. I will need to call First Impressions and see what they advise. I would have thought a small touch up paint bottle would have been left.After the first error, I called Tracey and told him what happened. I realize that it is not in his control, but there should be some sort of quality control in production to check that before the installer's, the customer's and the fabricator's time is wasted. To this day I have yet to receive any correspondence from Tracy.I don't feel like a valued customer. The company is so big. Tracy boasted to me that they do business all over the world. When you get that big, the customer gets thrown to the side.
5	Our sales guy Kurt was very helpful. He showed us all the options and styles and then custom designed an entry gate that fit out taste and budget.  Matt the installer showed up right on time and was very professional and courteous.  We're very happy with the result which should add to the curb appeal and value of our home.
4	This is an update to my review from 9/3/2013. Shortly after I wrote the review for First Impression Security Doors, I received a call from Tom. He addressed some of the issues I had such as the small rust spots that were forming and explained to me what they were and how to resolve them. He had expressed to me how much they value the customer and was apologetic for the miscommunication during the installation process. He insured me that he would be addressing it in their meeting. A week after that conversation, Tom followed up with me. He had told me that the owner of the company was making strides to fix their protocal. First Impression also wanted to send me  something for my troubles and my time wasted while waiting for the installation process to be complete. I did not expect to receive anything nor was it necessary. With Tom diligently following up with my review, presenting it to the owner of First Impressions and the token of gratitude, it's made me reconsider my views of being a valued customer at First Impressions.
5	04/29/1  Updated review 5 starsWell we have had the doors for well over year and I must say it's been one of our better investments. Other than the initial problems with the locks, they have held up well and look great. It's a pity we didn't have them installed years earlier. We can safely lock the 2 outside doors and leave our main front and back doors open all night to let a through breeze. It's great. 12/1/13 update review (4 x star)Locks seem to be holding up well and very happy with the doors otherwise.11/7/13 updated review (3 x star):First Impressions finally did the right thing and sent out a more experienced technician. Both locks repaired without fuss. I guess the first technician they sent was very weak and gave me the run around with some ridiculous stories. I must admit I do like the quality of the doors and install was good. So not sure whether or not I should over-look this hiccup in service. upgraded from 1 x star to 3 stars. If the locks hold up i will move up to 4 starsInitial Review: (1 x star):Nice doors and good initial install. However, we have had a lot of problems with the locks. Key wouldn't come out when fully turned. We had the service guy come out and he said he couldn't replace the lock until it fully fails!!!  We have to go through all kinds of contortions to get the keys out - it seems it has to be aligned up and down correctly before you withdraw the key. Now the front door is doing the same thing.  That's just totally ridiculous... and incredibly frustrating. The doors are only approx less than a year old.If I had read all the bad reviews I see on Yelp about this company  - I should have gone elsewhere - stupid me for not looking first.....
4	We needed a security door with metal screen to front door and a window guard to a side window on our garage. From the initial contact to installation, First Impression met every expectation. We called a few other companies and were getting the run around. When we called First Impression, we were greeted by a pleasant girl on the phone who scheduled our free, in home estimate. The pricing was slightly higher than what we were hoping but the quality is worth it. You get what you pay for. The in home salesman was pleasant and described the types of doors we could get, the time it would take to deliver and install and measured another door for us that we might want to have serviced in the future. We paid upfront and received a cash discount as well as our $100 off for being an Angie's List client. We were called the next day for the scheduling a month later.  A day before our scheduled installation, we received a confirmation call and I received a call on the day of when my technician was on the way. This is how ALL COMPANIES SHOULD DO BUSINESS! Michael showed up on time and went through the process of installation with me. He was friendly, efficient and clean. Installation took about 4 hours from start to finish.Total price was $1,500 and time from initial consultation to install was about a month.
1	Let me start by saying I attempted to use this company and my review is not based on their products or install abilities.  I contacted First Impressions after speaking with them at the home and garden show about a small project for two decorative window coverings which they said was not too small of a job and would be able to take on.  They instructed me to contact them after the show with dimensions and other details and would be happy to work on this.  I supplied photos and dimensions and in a reasonable amount of time I was given a quote of $500.  The salesman Shane then followed up and said the owner feels $600 was more reasonable.  I politely declined based on the new price and said I would shop around and circle back should I change my mind.  Approximately 6 weeks later I contacted Shane again and said I would like to move forward,  I resent photos and dimensions per his request and he said he would get back to me the next day after speaking with the owner.  After 20 days and a few follow-up emails from me (all of which were polite and simply asked if there was any update) I was finally (politely) informed that First Impressions could not take this project at this time.  I inquired if it was because the job was too small and received a reply with a very brief apology for the inconvenience.  While all correspondence was polite I simply cannot recommend a company that changes the price on you, then takes 20 days to respond and turns down your business.  Too bad too their products look very nice on the website.Just a brief update 6/13/14: Since the time of this review I contacted Great Gates who designed and built the product I needed and at a price lower than the original quote provided by First Impression.  I have now used Great Gates for a few different projects and have been satisfied with their service.
5	Love the new doors that they installed.  We had 3 doors installed (two single doors and one double) - which makes 4 in total.  Everyone is very professional - from Bobby our sales person to Matt the installer.  My only disappointment is that I don't have  another door. :-)
5	I love my security door. It was such an easy process, it looks good, and didn't take long to get the door put on. Thank you!
5	We absolutely love our new screen door from First Impression and so does our dog.  We now get more fresh air and sunlight into our home.  It is very high quality and you staff from sales guy to installer were top-notch. Thanks!
5	My wife and I purchased a security door for our front door 7 months ago.  We absolutely love the door and the professionalism of First Impression.   We decided that we wanted the same door for our backyard patio door as well.  The entire experience with First Impression for both doors was so easy and its nice to work with a company that goes above and beyond for their customers and appreciates the business.  You absolutely get what you pay for with First Impression.   If I had another door to do, I would.  Keep up the great work First Impression!
5	We are very pleased with our new patio security door. We now only wish we had done it sooner. The entire process was professional, including the installation.
5	This company came highly recommended to us and they lived up to their recommendation. Sales person was friendly and on time. He wasn't pushy and helped us pick colors based on his experience. The installers were professional and showed up within the window allotted. One of my favorite things is they call 30 minutes before they get there so you know! Great experience , I would and have highly recommended them!
5	I submitted a request for an estimate online and received a call back the next morning. The sales Person was professional and very knowledgable. A couple of days after the purchase I received a call to schedule the installation. Communication was awesome and the installer did an awesome job!If you need a security door this is the company to use!!
5	We just had a security door installed from First Impressions.  This is the 3rd time we have used this company and highly recommend them to anyone for the quality of their product and great customer service.  We really appreciated them working with us because we were in the process of building a house and backed out of the project.  We had put down a non-refundable deposit of $1150.00 which we just figured was gone but after talking to Jennifer at the Peoria store, she took our concerns to a higher level in the company and they worked with us and now we have another beautiful door on the house we purchased.  Thank you First Impressions for everything, we really appreciate everything you've done so we didn't loose our money.
1	We had an appointment with this company yesterday. No call, no show.Nice way to do business.
5	Our new vineyard iron entry door is a thing of beauty ! I wish I could share a picture of the job this team did to TRANSFORM the front of our home. The sales staff was very helpful. Adam did not pressure any part of the sale. He answered all of our MANY questions and provided excellent insights into the myriad of interesting options. We coordinated all of our little unique design elements directly with the CAD design staff. David provided all of the details and adjusted the design quickly and skillfully. Robin set up the install in a VERY timely manner, and called to remind us the day before. She even helped us salvage our old door. The installation team of Mike & Ricky was on time and very efficient. Their expertise was evident by the beautiful workmanship and the obvious pride they took in their work.    This team is a "well oiled machine" that deserves credit for excellence in every step of the way.   The quality of the door and materials is obvious to any that see it. We are REALLY enjoying our beautiful new door !
5	the door installation and service was exceptional. I will highly recommend this business over and over..
5	I love my new sunscreens. They really seem to help keep the heat out and they look a lot better than I thought they would. I bought the black ones that keep out 80% of UV rays. Great service too! I highly recommend First Impression.
5	Today we had our security screen door serviced and the piston replaced after several years of use. When the technician finished, the door looks brand new!  He went over and above what we expected.  We recommend First Impression again and will tell our family and friends to use this company in Gilbert.
5	We purchased a new front door and couldn't be happier. The door is beautiful. The service was excellent. We would highly recommend FIRST IMPRESSION to anyone!!
5	This is the second time I have used First Impressions at two different residences.  They have great customer service and quality doors.  I was lucky enough to have my door installed on my birthday, they arrived on time as promised. The door was absolutely gorgeous.  My front door is red so I had to match it.  I ordered the Napa in Montero Red and it was the perfect match.  The door was installed three weeks earlier than expected.  The installer was very nice, had me view the door prior to installing to ensure it was what I ordered. He explained the maintenance and upkeep, safety of keeping the key near the door in the event of an emergency.  The entire experience was flawless.  Terry Hardin was my sales person for both transactions.  I highly recommend, if you need a quality security door, First Impression is the only way to go.
5	First Impression this company is across the board a great business. From the start of the process to the install I was working with true professional people. I cannot express enough what a great job they did.
5	Amazing door!! And equally amazing company to do business with. I urge you to check them out before settling on a "cheaper" quality door from a big-box home improvement center. The cost is reasonable, considering the choices, colors, quality and warranty on the door itself and the workmanship. Stop by one of their sales locations, or at the very least, check out their website. You won't be sorry!!
1	I think honesty is sometimes the best policy.   We had a backyard block wall that had to be destroyed and a gate put in its placed.  I called First Impression in mid April.  They looked at the project, and gave me an estimate for construction of the gate.   They said they'd give me a call for the estimate on demo of the block wall.   It is now mid june, and haven't heard anything from them.  I then had Great Gates scheduled for an estimate 3 weeks after First Impression.  They provided a detailed estimate, I went ahead with the project and they've been mailing me updates.   Needless to say who I will go with for our $10k+ front double iron entry door project.  It won't be First Impression.
5	Very easy to work with all the way through the process. The salesman was knowledgeable and listened to what our needs/wants were. There was no high pressure to contract for a higher priced door. The installation was quick and professional. I highly recommend this company for your security door!
2	Our first impression of these guys was great but after that OH BOY! We were purchasing a new home and from front stoop to back gate are really doing it up. We saw them at the Home Show in Phoenix and immediately made an appointment. They explained that usually the rep comes to the house. We asked for a meeting in the Scottsdale Showroom instead as we wanted to see our options. Written in large print on our reservation and circled were the words MEET AT SCOTTSDALE SHOWROOM. So yesterday we (living in Tempe) took time off work and drove up there for our 3pm meeting. At 230 as we were preparing to leave we got a call from Shawn asking if we could make it earlier but since we were just leaving we couldn't. So we drive to Scottsdale and walk in the door. The gal in the back of the store yells out - "hi how can we help you". We yell back (oddly she seems opposed to getting out of her chair - maybe she has a condition or something so I don't want to judge) "we are here for our appointment at 3pm with Shawn". She yells out - "sorry don't see you have an appointment here". I yell back - "well here is my paperwork showing I do" as I wave the yellow sheet. "Nope I don't see it" she yells back (still not getting up from the chair and walking towards us - just yelling back and forth). After a few more volleys of us inquiring if she happens to know Shawn if this is really First Impressions if maybe Shawn was given the wrong info and was at our home etc. I finally walk back to the back and show her our appointment card. At this point I am ready to be done with First Impression and she still has no idea how to handle the situation (maybe you could call Shawn, maybe standing up to great your potential customer who is preparing to drop $5-10k with you today, maybe apologize and offer to assist us) so we just decided to end the yelling and leave. On the way back we call Shawn and sure enough he was given the wrong info and is sitting in our drive. We suggest either he waits, we go back to the showroom or we reschedule. Shawn is not able to decide what he wants to do - but eventually offers to wait. He says he doesn't really want to just sit in his car and asks for suggestions of what he can do while waiting (huh seriously, you don't have a google machine, you can't catch up on sales calls, no cat videos are left on the interwebs?) ...  he asks "is there a starbucks close" - so we give him directions.At this point my wife has joined me in being fed up and she tells him we will reschedule at another time. Yes we will - with anyone other than First Impression.
3	So often companies ignore constructive criticism. But I've got to say, first thing this morning Mike West from First Impression called and admitted the screw up apologized profusely and took full responsibility. So we are going to try again and set another appointment. Maybe you do get a second chance to make a First Impression!
5	We had a very nice set of french double security doors installed from First Impressions. From the salesperson that came out to present their goodies to the installer, and completed installation they were terrific.We would highly recommend this company. Thank you!
5	This is the second time we have used this company.  First, we were impressed with the knowledge and professionalism of the sales rep.  He took all of the time needed to work with us to develop a design.  He had all of the necessary samples and pictures so that we felt comfortable with our final decision.The installation team was great. They went about their job and just got it done!  They took the time to explain how the product worked and how to care for it.  They clearly reflected the pride in their product that is so critical in a competitive business.We are extremely pleased with our courtyard gate and new entry door.  The quality of the product seems far superior to others we considered - and we looked at quite a few at home shows.Overall, our experience was positive and we highly recommend this company.
5	Very professional! Many options. High-end quality. Love the look of my gate!!! You get the quality that you pay for. We are very happy with the customer service and the beautiful gate. I would recommend them to my friends and family.
5	This company is amazing. We were referred by neighbors and did all the initial work online. They sent out a sales rep, Greg, who helped us make our final choices. We visiting their showroom in Scottsdale where is was obvious that they have a very high quality product. The installers were wonderful, fast, friendly and tidy. Our door is gorgeous. First Impressions is one of the best companies with whom I have ever done business.
