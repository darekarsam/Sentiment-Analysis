4	Huge selection of veggies... Great sale going on... Well organized.. good selection of priya and gits mix instant foods.
5	I used to shop at Around The World Market in Durham and Cary and was really happy to find out they were opening a store in Charlotte. They have great selection of brands and products, the store is pretty big and service is good. I always find people to help me with comparing different products and brands. The owner Paresh Bhai is really friendly and funny! This place is a pleasure to shop at, unlike Patel Brothers in Pineville, which is almost like a fish market and is full of rude cashiers who don't really care about their customer base. They also have frozen Halal meat for sale, including minced goat!Around the World Market gets brownie points for having a little sugarcane juice machine ($1 per cup), 50 cents for a cup of fresh ginger or masala chai and for playing Radio City live from India!
1	Too much expensive and they also sold expired milk to us. I am suggesting to everyone not to go. recently we moved from California as compare to that this shop is double in rates.
