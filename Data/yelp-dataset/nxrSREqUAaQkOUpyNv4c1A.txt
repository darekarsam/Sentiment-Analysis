3	Great little spot on St Hubert! Very friendly gal behind the counter who was generous with the samples, and lots of daily flavours to try. I was feeling hot and sticky so I went with the Lemon Lime which was so tart and sour I was forced to pull some fairly unattractive faces but was fully pleased by the flavour punch and the chewy candied lemon rind inside. Next time I'll try what looks like a house specialty, the coffee with St Henri roasters espresso. Looks like there are also some nice sandwich and homemade lemonade options, and definitely some comfortable wooden tables to plunk down at. We couldn't find a bathroom, which was odd, and my friend was given mango instead of the mandarine she ordered, but neither of these were a big deal.
3	Good ice creams if you don't like them too creamy.It's always nice to be able to try sample before setting your heart on one or two flavors and the samples were quite generous too.In the end, I had the Dulce de leche (maybe not milky enough for me) and the Maple syrup (really good but then I looove all things maple syrup-y!). My friend had the vanilla which was very good and tasted like actual vanilla for once and the mango sorbet which we found refreshing.They also have others specialties and since I've spotted it, I will definitely be back to try one of these big maple syrup doughnut!
