5	Lucy Vegas is an amazing site that provides you with ideas on fun things to do in Vegas, while offering its website viewers the chance to win some amazing prizes! I originally won 2 tickets to Nevada Wild Fest. After meeting the owner herself while I went to pick up my tickets, she treated me to, 2 more additional tickets! Their office is so chique & trendy and the people who work there along with the owner are very friendly and hospitable!You can tell they really have a passion for what they do and that they highly value their patrons!
