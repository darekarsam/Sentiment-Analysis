3	No problem with my reservations. Only problem was when I was the desk person if my husband and I could both drive the car he said yes but didn't bother to tell me that there was an $80.00 fee to do that and when we were setteling everything up he asked me to start signing things and luckily I read what I was signing and saw that I would have been charged for both drivers.  Car was good except for there was a big huge bird dropping on the front window and there was a cover missing on the front passengers side of the seat which would have covered some metal plates that were sharp and greasy.
1	id give them zero stars if it were an option.  Honestly....this company is borderline corrupt!  I will not rent from them again.  ive never had a worse experience........actually ive never had a bad experience til dollar.  go to any other company not dollar!
1	Horrible! Overcharged my credit card by hundreds of dollars! I would NEVER recommend Dollar Rental to anyone!
