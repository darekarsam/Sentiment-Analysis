4	If you hate Starbucks, don't expect to love it.The rest of this review is for intelligent people: go at wintertime.  November is best: they still have the pumpkin spice latte AND the peppermint mocha.Skinny peppermint mocha.  So you can fool yourself into thinking you're drinking some kind of miraculously delicious-tasting form of Slimfast.They're quick, and delicious.  The location is cute (on the street corner in the old city) and convenient (across the street from the Palais des Congres)-- so if you get sick of waiting in line at Tim Horton's (where they do have better pastries-- but no peppermint mochas!), this is a great place to be.  And if you're in town for, say, a conference... As the days go by, you'll see more and more people carrying around Starbuck's beverage cups.Not bashing Tim Horton's, but there definitely seems to be a trend as people become more and more in the know about the restaurants and cafes within kissing distance of the convention center...

1	We have been to many Starbucks in our time but this particular shop has the distinction of being the worst Starbucks In North America. My 12 year old daughter ordered a refresher and the barista made the wrong one by mistake and when she pointed her mistake out the barista told her that she would have to drink the one she made or pay for a new one. They still gave me attitude when I asked them to make it right. I never thought I would bother reviewing a Starbucks as I thought they maintain a good overall brand. Not so with this place!
