1	Worst move experience EVER , before even hiring them I was told they were insured and bonded.  That three guys would be better than 2 because it would be quicker and less money.  $1000 later and practically all my wood furniture and leather couch had been scratched or broken.  Owner Paul and his Forman Manny refuse to take responsibility. FYI - the 3 man was to fold blankets on the truck not move furniture. Negative 5 stars if I could give them that. They suck.
5	These guys moved me from Scottsdale to Chandler.  Had a great experience, they were on time and respectful, nothing got broke, and the price was great.  What more can you ask for?
1	This was a great company at one time.  However, a year ago, when they moved us, the lead man was not good, verbally abusive to the boys helping  ...... I had a gold ring stolen from my bathroom, where they should not have been.  There was a college ring, a solid gold ring, and a sterling bracelet.  Whomever stole the ring picked the expensive one and left the other two items.  Nothing was ever done about this.  Two of the men left for several hours that day, leaving two boys to do a lot of the work.  One of them probably sold the ring in that time.
