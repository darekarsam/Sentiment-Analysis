3	I went there for lunch. I loved the soup of the day. I took an order of samosas (which weren't on the menu), they fixed my samosa craving but weren't the best I've ever had. The I had the aloo pois/peas which is a dry curry with peas, potatoes. Served with rice and a meaningless salad. The aloo was very good but the sides were insignificant. Price was dirt cheap which is not easy to find in that area.
3	I ordered for delivery, they forgot the rice, and I got two regular naan breads even though i had ordered one regular and one with cheese (and of course I was charged on the bill in both cases).The food itself was decent, but not great. It is pretty affordable though, so a good place to go to on a budget i suppose...
