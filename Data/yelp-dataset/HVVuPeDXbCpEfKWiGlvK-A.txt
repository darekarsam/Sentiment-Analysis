5	Top of the cross fitness trainers and a whole lot more.
5	I've taken multiple firearms courses with PFC and highly recommend them. Professionals who really know how to present their material as well as being highly qualified to do so.
5	I attended PFC's Handgun 2 yesterday and can't recommend them highly enough. Las Vegas is lucky to have them here as local trainers and I encourage anyone interested in high quality firearms and combatives training to seek them out.I've attended numerous classes from PFC ranging from Handgun 1 & 2 to Small Knife Skills with Chris Fry (Great instructor from NY). Along the way I've attended several of their 4 hour refresher clinics and would recommend attending those to keep your skills up between more formal shooting classes.I've had the opportunity to train with PFC's Mike Barnhart and Brian Hartman on multiple occasions and both of them stand out amongst their peers in the training community. They bring their own individual expertise, knowledge, experiences and humor along with a degree of professionalism that makes for a truly awesome training experience.
5	the best fire arms instruction available anywhere! Mike Barnhart was very professional and friendly which made my training experience a positive one !
