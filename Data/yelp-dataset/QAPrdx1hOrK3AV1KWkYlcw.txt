1	I would give it 0 stars if I could. To many fees, don't care about customers, poor business practices like not putting through charges in the order received so they can profit on overdrafts. B of A also does not care about your privacy and will share your information.Wost of all forclosing on soldiers while over seas defending our county.
4	Great for simple transactions - quick, efficient, and friendly service. For more complicated requests, they seem a bit disorganized and slow. Eventually it all gets done correctly though. Beware of turning left out of the parking lot - it might be easier to circle around to go out of the light at Apache Wells.BTW the previous review seems to be about the company in general, not this branch in particular.
1	Seems like every time we go to this branch there is 5-10 people in line and only two tellers. (Which is not too bad because lets face it BoA stock has dropped from $54.85 to $16.64 so you might expect a little penny pinching.) However there is no excuse for tellers to be so busy and have one or two supervisors wandering the floor shuffling papers and fooling with computer tablets. This one clown actually went to every person in line and asked why they were there and offered to show them how to use the ATM as if no one ever used an ATM before. Jump in and help the tellers when you see more than 5 people in line how about some team spirit instead of that's not my job.
