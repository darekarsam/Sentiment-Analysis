5	We had a great experience with Diamondback Lock and Key. Our locksmith was Loren, and he came to the office quickly. Loren was polite, professional and took the time to explain to us the situation and when we could expect the door to be opened. If I hear anyone with locksmithing needs I will absolutely recommended calling Diamondback lock and key.
5	Dude came out and unlocked my car. Everything was explaind and no surprises.
5	Jack was wonderful! After having any exhausting experience with another locksmith, I was so impressed with Diamondback's responsiveness. Jack arrived in less than 20 minutes and completed the job even quicker. Thank you for helping me in a pinch after a very stressful day. Did I say EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE? Yes, it was superb!
5	Jack showed up super quick, got me in my house (locked myself out) and even greased the lock for me! Will use again!
