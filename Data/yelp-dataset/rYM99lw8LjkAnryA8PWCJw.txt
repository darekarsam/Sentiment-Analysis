5	Great service. great prices. Local in our neighborhood. Easy to work with. Honest.  I wish we had more places like this in town.  I would highly recommend Kirch Appliance to someone on a budget or looking for a great value!
5	They have great discounted used appliances. I got a stove for my parents here and they wanted a different one, so Kirch switched it out. They delivered the stove in the snow storm and took the old one away. Great local company!
2	How does this place have good reviews? I have apartments and Kirch is the only game in town when it comes to used appliances which keeps me coming back; but I'm annoyed I did every time. I have purchased 2 refurbished coin op washers here, both died in less than a year. I have purchased about 8 stoves or refrigerators, each time they try to charge to remove the old one. Each time I refuse and they always take it for free, because they are going to fix and sell it.  I called them recently for a stove repair. I told the guy on the phone exactly what the error code is. They made an appointment to come fix it; they did not fix it and instead just told me the error code. Duh, that's why I called and that's what I told you. First the guy said they would have to order the part and come back. Then a day later some other guy called claiming the manufacturer recommends not repairing when this part is needed.  It's a $50 part and they are flat out lying hoping to sell me a used stove while taking one back to the shop at the same time.  I've had enough, the difference between a used stove/fridge/washer and a new one is not enough to put up with these good old boys - just go to Sears or someone like that.
