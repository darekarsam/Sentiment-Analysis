5	I needed a snack for the long flight to the Baltimore Washington metro area.  Have to say they have the best nuts I've ever eaten (almonds, cashews and walnuts).  Crispy, fresh and perfectly seasoned. The woman working the counter was nice and courteous.
4	Got some tasty popcorn for the flight home. Love that they have a healthier option of snacks. Fruit and trail mix, nuts, simple food. Love it
5	Well what can I say this fruit likes some nuts! Haha ok ok I'll stop! Awesome selection and nice change to the normal airport munchies. I'll be stopping back through on the way home for more!
4	Great nut variety, glad I have stopped. Every time im in vegas and have a greasy food + heat - kills me every time. Nuts keep not hungry and full of energy - easpecially nuts from Vegas!!!
5	Ok. I stumbled upon this place today and it was better than i could have ever imagined. The lady who helped me was extremely nice and friendly. She gave me a few samples and made suggestions. I got many different items but will ONLY highlight the toffee brittle. This toffee could be the greatest candy I've ever had in my life. It wasn't like the normal hard and crunchy toffee. It was smooth, creamy, crunchy, and soft at the same time. It's hard to explain but absolutely heavenly. I will be back. This place does not disappoint. A+++
