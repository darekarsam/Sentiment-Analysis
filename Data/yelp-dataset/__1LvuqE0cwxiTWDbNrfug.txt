4	What a lovely, friendly boutique on the Plaza St-Hubert.I was prepared for prices here to be a bit higher, because the clothing & accessories are designed and made in Canada (mostly Quebec). I don't mind paying a bit more to shop locally. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the prices were comparable to my local chain ladies' clothing store (Reitmans, Laura or similar) -- for much better quality of fabric/construction and more interesting designs.I had a really great experience here, trying on a dozen items before settling on a top and a dress which both fit like a charm and look great. Again, a surprise because often this kind of small-scale clothing comes only in sizes small, extra-small, and super-tiny...which I am not.
