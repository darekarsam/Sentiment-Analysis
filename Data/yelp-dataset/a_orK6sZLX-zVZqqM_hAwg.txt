4	Superb grilled chicken - amazingly crispy skin, excellent with rice or chips. The salad and peri-peri sauce are both great as well. We've eaten at a few different Portuguese places in Montreal and this stands out as a fave. Service can be a little slow, but the food is worth the wait. Really nice on the terrace in the summertime too.
5	Montreal has so many great restaurants but we like coming here for one simple reason, great food. Whenever we are in Montreal we always make the effort to eat at Rotisserie Mile End because the food is always fresh and you never leave there feeling like you didn't eat enough. I personally love their calamari dish and the grilled sardines, but quite often I order their open flame grilled chicken with either fries or their home made roasted potatoes. You get Portuguese bread and salad with your meal. They have a small but very yummy selection of Portuguese pastries, like the traditional natas. If you want an affordable but yummy meal then you have to pop in and eat there. The owners Nelson and Grace are usually there and they will make your visit a very welcoming one.
1	Rotisserie Mile End, where to start. I had a whole chicken portuguese style, it was tasty but dry. Overall good but had better at Romados.Had an entree of calamari but what a surprise, for 6$+ only had one small piece. I only noticed when I got home, because I ordered to takeout. Will not go back,  for 28$ that I paid for the chicken an calamari and can get better value and quality at Romados or even St-hubert chicken.
5	Sooo yummy!!!!! Will definitely go again and the service is quick and friendly! A must try.
