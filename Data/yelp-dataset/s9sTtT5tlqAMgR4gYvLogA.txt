4	Its your average Chili's. Predictable and a great option when you don't want to think about it!!Located very close to the Country Inn we stayed at, it's a dependable place to eat with great service. Our waitress Rose was fast and cheerful. I had shrimp on a Mediterranean salad. It was good but for those who don't like a sweet dressing, maybe substitute something more savory (my husband hates sweet dressings. When he asked how my dinner was I remarked, "You'd hate it!") The kids loved their sliders and the baby loved sampling bits of steak from my husband's fajitas. I wished we'd had space for dessert but, alas, we did not.Keep the blackberry iced tea on your list of good drinks to try. After all, In Phoenix come June, you're going to need them!
3	I had my baby-back ribs, service was alright, ribs were a little dry.
3	================== RETURN VISIT UPDATE ==================Came again Thursday night after a meeting I attended with nine other people. It was the same group of people I went with in my first review of this establishment. The group was seated right away and our drink orders were taken. So why the low rating? Why? Because I ordered the Mango-Chile Tilapia. I took one bite and thought it was terrible. If you've seen my other reviews I normally like Tilapia so it wasn't the fish it was how the fish was prepared. It was cooked fine but the Mango-sauce with avocados on top was not appetizing.At this point everyone in our party was served and enjoying their meals. I was waiting for the waitress to come around and ask if anyone needed refills or how was their food, But she was nowhere to be found. When she finally did come around everyone was just about finished with their meals. Then she asks about how everyone's food was. So I told her. Someone who I assume was a manger comes over and asks if I wanted her to have my meal recooked. At first I said no I just wanted it taken off my bill.. because everyone was already done.  After awhile I reluctantly agreed to having my meal recooked without the mango sauce TO-GO..Upon reflection I should have asked for the meal to be comp'd and be done with it. FOOD: The food is exactly what you would expect from a Chili's Restaurant. :  SERVICE: I must admit for a large group we did receive good service. PRICE: The price  for the quality of food you receive is OK. AMBIANCE: It's like every other Chili's. CONCLUSION: When this sort of thing happens I don't know about you but it can completely ruin your dinning experience. I mean nothing ruins my mood easier than a poor meal when I'm expecting something much better. How I respond depends on my mood and on the circumstances. I didn't appreciate the waitress not returning to our table for such a long time because this whole experience could have been avoided. . RETURN FACTOR 50-50....%.       ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH
2	This place is pretty bad.I have never seen a restaurant with such great looking food on the menu deliver such lousy food. Service is not genuine. Burgers are greasy and disgusting along with the steaks. Avoid this place no wonder how good the 2 for $20 sounds.Used to be a fan of Chili's before. What happened?
3	I have to admit, it is one of the nicest Chili's I have been to in quite some time. Albeit it was a Sunday afternoon so it was a smidge slower than say a Friday night, it was still a nice. The chips we had for the chips and salsa were warm and delicious and the lighter fare chicken salad was excellent. One of the waitresses however seem to be having a bad day as it appeared she was in some type of disagreement with one of her tables. I actually felt bad for her because like everyone else, I couldn't help but stop and stare like everyone else. All in all, we will be back again soon.
1	i have never had such bad service in my life and i have never been so mad about bad service before either. My friend and I decide to go to Chili's for our 1hr lunch break. We arrive at 11am. Within 5 mins of being there we order our food. She orders hers, i order mine, and we order one to go for someone else back at work. We sit there for 45mins without receiving our food before having to track down the waitress (because no one bothered to check on us). We tell the waitress to just bring out food out to-go because now we have run out of time and need to get back to work. 5 mins later we get our food and 2 out of 3 orders are wrong! One was a completely different meal than what was ordered. i ask how long it would take to re-make them and we are told about 17mins. At this point we have 10mins to get back to work. Needless to say, we ended up leaving and going back to work without getting to eat any lunch.
4	My turkey sandwich was excellent and my husband enjoyed the chicken enchilada soup. His quesadilla tasted good but was sloppily put together. Two pieces had no sante fe sauce on them but 1 piece had a glob of sauce. Overall the service was good.
4	This is our favorite location, we've always had wonderful and attentive service and the food has been great. It's Chili's we don't expect a five course meal but it's a great spot to catch dinner or lunch. The bar drinks are inexpensive and usually pretty yummy, the bathrooms are kept clean and if you have any problem the managers are very quickly at your table to address it.
4	I ordered the Atlantic Salmon and it was pretty good. Also, my dining group ordered chips and salsa. Kudos for accommodating the vegetarian in our group. Pretty happy. The server was attentive and helpful. Everyone at my table ate EVERYTHING on their plate. Everyone was satisfied and were quite happy.
1	This is the worst review I have ever given restaurant. I waited 1 hour to get food and drink.  The manager did nothing except make excuses.   Totally  understaffed and poorly managed. I will never come back.
