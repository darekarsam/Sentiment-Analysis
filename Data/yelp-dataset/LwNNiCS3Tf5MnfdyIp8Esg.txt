5	Great personable doctors and nice office staff - what more could you want?  Honestly Max Greenman and his sons are amazing eye doctors and I should know - I have a series of difficult eye problems and they have been able to assist me with all of them.  In addition to detached retinal issues (full disclosure the surgery for this issue was before going to Greenman's practice) and a wicked astigmatism I have had corneal scratches, a mild cateract problem, double vision in one eye, eye infections and all sorts of "fun" over the years.  Greenman's docs have met me on the weekend when the office was officially closed to address an issue that could not wait.  They are really fantastic at taking care of their customers.  The doctors are great, the office staff is nice, the location is nice, the parking is easy, what more could anyone want?
1	My experience at the appointment itself was fine - it was the weeks afterwards that were a disaster. I ordered contact lenses that had a rebate, and the woman in the contact lens dept. told me that their staff would mail me the rebate info & all the documentation I would need in order to receive the rebate. After a week, the rebate info didn't come so I called to follow up and left a voicemail for the contact lens woman. She never called back, so I followed up again the next week, this time speaking to the front desk who said they would hand-deliver her the message. She still never called back. It took so many phone calls and so many weeks before they sent me the documents I needed, that once I received them the deadline for the rebate had already passed (it had to be submitted within 30 days of ordering the contacts). I will not be returning to Greenman Eye Associates.
