5	Excellent service. Honest and timely. Needed them for an emergency service. They were prompt, and did not try to up sell and rob me. Very professional. I have had others try to take advantage of the situation. They didn't and That is appreciated.
5	I just called a Las Vegas Key Shop Because my friend locked her baby in the car and they came out and opened it at no charge.  I like this company as they were only concerned about the baby and not about getting paid. This company deserves my rating.
1	RUDE RUDE RUDE. If I had the option to put a negative 5 star on this I would. I am seriously amazed how rude someone can be. I work for a company and we usually always call to get prices for our preferred vendors list. I decided to call Las Vegas Key Shop because they have 5 stars. I have no idea how they have 5 stars... it seriously blows my mind. I called and was speaking to some guy- should of gotten his name. It sounded like I woke him up and he was just not a happy camper. Not only did I feel rushed but out of kindness I asked him if he was busy at the moment. He answered with" NO, I am obviously talking to you right now right?" Um seriously? so I responded with "You extremely rude, Never mind we do not want to use you guys" then he told me to kiss his ass. Okay absolutely not. UNPROFESSIONAL and it seriously disgust me how someone can be so crewel. DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE.
