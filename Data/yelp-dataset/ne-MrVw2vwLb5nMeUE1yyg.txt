5	Been going to this location for a year or so. I normally order online and go and pick up myself within the 15-25 minute time they ask for. Good pizza at a good price especially when they have the 50% off coupons for the coyotes or the dbacks winning a game
1	i called to order pizza, they were very polite. but when we got the pizza it tasted terrible and the wings are so small and taste lousy.. the thin crusttaste like crackers. the pizza was greasy and tastless.im giving it one star due to the awful tasting pizza and wings. sorry papa going to stay with barros....
