1	Came with the full family after a play at the centaur.Service was... over zealousThey forgot 3 of the 10 items we orderedThe salad had no dressingMy club sandwich came 10 min after the rest of the food got to the table and was made with bread ends/heels.I could go on but...There are great Montreal restaurants but this is not one of them.Do not waste your time or money.
1	One star is too generous. Having just arrived in Old Montreal via the Metro, it was 2pm and we were famished. Wandered down to de la Commune looking for terrace seating on a spectacular late-August day, and a pleasant fellow handed us a menu (with pictures) of a simple, kid-friendly, reasonably pried lunch dishes. We sat down.  Big mistake.Yes, this is a tourist area - I get that.  But this food was barely edible. The famous Quebec poutine?  Cold fries sprinkled with unmelted mozzarella cheese and canned brown gravy.  All cold.  Microwaved chicken nuggets (nothing like picture) & more cold fries.Pasta Salad? Cold spirals doused in mayo with chunks of green pepperHam crepe? Doused with more mayo, inside and out.The warm water has already been mentioned, at least our paper cups were clean.Ironically, the only decent item was the 1,99$ hot dog, it was hot (!), the bun toasted in a panini press.However, in total - this meal was pathetic.  Zero stars. Beware.
