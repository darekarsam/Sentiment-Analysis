1	In assisting a friend who's relocating from the east coast,we went apartment shopping.Upon arrival,the woman at the desk took his info and told him about the apartments.We asked to see one and she said none were available to see.She said the one that was coming up for rent wasn't "ready"so she wasn't allowed to show it.I asked if they had a model apartment,she said "No."He explained he was only in town for 24 hours and asked if there was another time within that time frame he could see it and she said "No."He liked the location so I told him I'd go back on my own after he left and see if I could see one.I go a few days later.A different woman behind the desk.Leticia.(I so wish I got the first woman's name!)I explain the situation to Leticia and she apologizes to me that my friend wasn't shown an apartment and takes me on a tour of the property and shows me....wait for it...A MODEL APARTMENT...You know,the very specific thing I asked of the other woman who told me they didn't have one.I asked Leticia if this was a new feature within the last few days ans again she apologized stating the model is ALWAYS ready to be shown to interested parties and any "work"they need to do to it,is done off visiting hours...Needless to say,at that point it became obvious that at least the other woman had either no desire to get off her fat ass and do her job,or she didn't want to rent to caucasians...Either way,no excuse,and I'd never rent or refer anyone to this place.If that's what you get when not even a tennant,I can't imagine how services would be for a renter.Shame on you Camelback Cove for hiring either racists or lazy fucks.
1	I moved here about a month ago and it has been the worst apartments I lived in two bad I sign a year lease. With in the first weak or so we started to see roaches n they fumigated then next weak we seen them again plus we started to get bit by bed bugs wich are not in our Matress but in the bathroom which of course were stuck with paying 150$ for the fumigation of them. They tell you the apartment is cable ready is not one aux cable wrks the cable guy said all the other ones look nice with there covers but some there in between the walls the cable is chopped so is not cable ready. My rent is 735$ but after allocated water service 44.88 allocated sewer service 25.07local sales tax14.80allocated trash service3.70monthly service charge5.03and new account fee10$ it adds up to my new rent been 838.48 big difference this apartments are not recommended take it from me I live here till my lease is up 11 more months
