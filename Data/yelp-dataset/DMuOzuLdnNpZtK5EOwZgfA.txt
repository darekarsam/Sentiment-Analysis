5	Hello friends,This Big Lots it's located at the end of the Target Shopping Center closest to the AMC. It has replaced the other Big Lots further down South Blvd. It's very clean, nice, spacious, & will kept. I used to work as a Big Lots years ago &this is by far the best one yet. Grant it, that it's pretty new and hasn't been "broken in" yet. They sell furniture, food, electronics, house where,  lawn & gardening & toys. Go stop by, have a gander, take a look!!TTFN
3	Clean, organized, inexpensive. This shop has everything from some dry food items to toys and even furniture. Priced to move, as the saying goes.
5	I've been in several Big Lots' and this one is definitely the nicest one I've been too. The employees were helpful, the store was large and there was a great selection of merchandise. I just wish it was closer to where I live!
