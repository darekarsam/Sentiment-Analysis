3	Clean store. Nice one person staff. (seriously. I guess they weren't expecting a lot of people today) but even with the lone associate on the floor- she still managed to walk around, greet everyone and chat them up.  had some decent sales going on that I saw signs for.
3	i almost want to give them 2 stars for their last redesign of the men's and women's sections. Maybe it has been awhile since i've been in, but i walk in veer to the right like always and after noticing a few feminine looks realize they must have switched sides. So i back up and head the other direction hoping nobody noticed my initial directional mishap.  Wondering if i discovered the first Gap Women store i press on. It turns out that the men's section has been relegated to the back of the store. Fortunately, i did find a few nicely reduced pairs of socks, so i guess i left satisfied.
4	I've always been a fan of Gap & can always count on them to have the latest styles.  I don't normally shop this location, but was in Northlake Mall & my boyfriend wanted to check out their sales rack.There were several employees on the floor, but not one of them spoke to us/greeted us. This isn't detrimental to me, unless I need to ask them a question.  We perused some racks & didn't see anything we wanted & left.This location is pretty huge & of course is laid out with ladies on the left hand side & men's on the right (they have a separate store for Gap Kids). Everything was organized, folded/hung nicely. You can always count on the tags to display prices, even with they have a marked down price sticker on the tag.  Prices are reasonable & I always feel their quality holds up way better than their younger sister, Old Navy.
