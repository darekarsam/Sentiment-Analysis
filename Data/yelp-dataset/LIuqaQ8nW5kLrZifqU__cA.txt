4	I went here tonight for a book reading - The Daemon Parallel. My friend was going to be interviewing the author, Roy Gill, and the illustrator, Paul Mudie, so I popped along to listen (and clap and make appreciative noises). Pulp Fiction is a bookshop specialising in 'genre fiction' - mystery, fantasy, romance, crime, and science fiction novels. It's a gorgeous wee place, with lots of funny signs and a giant inflatable fish that roams around the room. It's not *really* my sort of reading - I like some of this stuff, but most isn't really my thing. That said, I loved the shop, and I know lots of people go there to just hang out and write during the day. There's a cafe, too, with sandwiches, coffee and cake. We bought sandwiches to eat before the reading and they were delicious. But... just a warning for anyone a bit fussy or with food intolerances - watch them like a hawk! I ordered a smoked duck and salad roll. Ok, ok, look, I only wanted ham! But they had none, so duck it was. And what I got was a baguette with salad, duck, cheese, raw ginger, berry reduction (aka jam) and vinaigrette. And it was amazing! But.. it wasn't what I ordered. So just, you know, be aware if you order something. And give yourself plenty of time, because all that ginger chopping and jam dripping took about 10 minutes per sandwich. Och, I really don't want to slag it off - I loved my sandwich and I loved the bookshop. Go there. Just know you're going to get werewolves and ginger, and all will be well.
