5	Good bowling specials, cheap buckets of beer, friendly service and the shoes aren't quite as bad as I remember them being. This is a great place to come and bring out your inner Lebowski over a bottle of Bud, non-stale pretzels and colourful bowling balls: I am a fan!
4	Cheap. Bowling. You want more than that? Get out. Get out, and don't come back.If you like bowling, then you'll like this place. If you don't really like bowling, and you just do it for the chicks, then you'll probably think this place could do better. But that's OK, they're renovating it as we speak, so shut up and make your throw.The beers are cheap (by the bucket), there's food (if you're game), and the staff a friendly. Go bowling.
