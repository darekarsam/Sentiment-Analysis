5	This place is very friendly and accommodating to patients.
1	My family and I have been seeing Dr. Traci Doan for the last 8 yrs and visits have always pleasant until today....she had different staff! I don't mind Ashley telling me procedures and charges BUT the hygienist, X-ray person and another woman in blue uniform.... WTF! 5 people had to tell me what needs to done! They were worst than salespeople pressuring me into buying a car....Dr. Doan and Kaitlyn are really nice but it's time to find a new dentist
1	I am a former patient and I agree money and extras are definitely present.  My biggest complaint tis that once you agree to a price it goes up.  This has happened on 2 occasions.  First is when a gold crown was prepaid and when I had it put in I was charged about $125 more because the price of gold went up.Question:  If the price of gold went down would I get a refund??? I was really PO'ed because when I prepaid it should have protected my costs.  As far as the other review goes, I think it is standard practice to discuss costs prior to services being rendered
5	Not that I enjoy dental work.. but this was a pleasant experience in getting a crown. The price was good and the work done was exceptional... Great Job!
5	I normally have a difficult time seeing dentists but people at A1 made be feel comfortable and at ease.All staff on hand were extremely kind, gentle, and informative... They are exceptional.  I would recommend this business to everyone!Silver
