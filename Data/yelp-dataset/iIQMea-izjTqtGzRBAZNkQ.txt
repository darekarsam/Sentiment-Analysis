5	This is a fantastic small hair salon. I have been going here for years and they are experts. You always feel valued and always have great service (and a GREAT cut too!).The ambiance is superb- small, quaint, and not full of egos that you would normally find at a salon of this caliber.I highly recommend!!!
5	I have been going to Andrew John Salon for many years, and have always had a positive experience. The salon is always clean, the staff courteous, and the hairstylists professional. They are very personable, and will work with you to give you the best look for you. I wouldn't go anywhere else! Highly recommend!
5	I've been going to Tracey for YEARS! And I mean years and years. I grew up going to this salon. Tracey has this unique ability to take what's in style, and fit it to you. She's great with color and the shape of a cut. I always leave feeling glamorous.I no longer live in Pittsburgh, but I always try to fit in a visit when I'm home! I miss you guys!
