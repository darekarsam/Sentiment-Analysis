5	Excellent service! Helped sell my father-in-laws house in 1 week at the asking price.
5	I have worked with Creative Home Stagers multiple times and have always been impressed with Carol's talent, work ethic and expertise.  The homes she has staged for my clients have sold quickly and my clients have been very happy with the results.
5	Today I met with Carol to discuss the sale of my home. She spoke quickly, I wrote quickly. Carol made the time with me count. I learned so much from her and I will implement her suggestions. I have no doubt that she will have helped me sell my house in a short amount of time - again, quickly!! I recommend Creative Home Stagers and I hope you will give them a call.
5	We had our home in Dilworth staged by Carol. She met with us to give her opinion, estimate, and suggestions as to what we should do prior to staging. She then arrived the day before staging to look at what was done and was pleased. After she staged our home, it looked wonderful, to the point where I commented "maybe we shouldn't put it on the market, I love it" - she gave such purpose to rooms we had never really used. She made every room feel clean and comfortable. After being on the market for just 2 days, we received wonderful feedback and an offer from the first family to look at our home. While the area and home were good, Carol and Creative Home Stagers made the home wonderful. She was pleasant to work with and truly a professional. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a stager or selling their home.
