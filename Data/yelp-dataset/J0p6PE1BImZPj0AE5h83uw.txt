4	After my last stylist butchered my hair/scalp, I had to find a new stylist.  I was quite pleased with my new stylist, Priscilla. I have long, frizzy hair, but she was able to do I great job. Will definitely go back.

4	Great staff and very clean. I have had Jackie the owner do my hair and Priscilla. The hair services I have got done here are: trims, color, hair cuts, wash and style and weaves. They give you advice to keep your hair growing long and strong! Jackie and Priscilla are very quick but spend quality time on your hair. They also do hair shows and fashion shows and they love having there clients involved. There is also a barber in the shop and they do wax services. Pricing is decent also. Great place go check them out.
