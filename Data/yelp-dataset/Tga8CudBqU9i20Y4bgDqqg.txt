5	Most of the houses in our neighborhood that have been up for sale have sat on the market for a significant time period. Those that did sell were almost given away, which didn't help everyone else's home values. Frenzel Properties worked with us to present our home in the most appealing way thanks to their complimentary home staging services and they spent a lot of time reseraching our area to help us determine an appropriate price that was fair to us as sellers, yet within reason for the market. In addition, the way they marketed our home through an online home tour with gorgeous professional photos , professional looking brochures showcasing our home for potential buyers to take with them and responsive communication with other Realtors, we received only positive feedback from each showing. All of their efforts paid off and our home was under contract within 14 days with an offer that was very near to our asking price. We couldn't have been more pleased! Frenzel Properties is now helping us to buy our next home and has kept our best interests in mind through the whole process. We can't rave enough about Kelly and Michelle!
5	Working with Kelly has been an unbelievably positive experience for me.  In a time of quite a few transitions, Kelly has stood out for his integrity, commitment to keeping my best interests at the center of his decision making, and has been consistently encouraging and positive throughout the marketing process. I would recommend working with him to anyone who is in the market to buy or sell-- and certainly plan on working with him again in the future.
