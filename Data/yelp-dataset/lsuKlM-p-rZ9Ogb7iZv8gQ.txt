5	yay Swurl! The perfect place to meet and catch up with friends. It's open late on weekends, and all year-round for those of us who need their froyo fix during the winters! They have new flavours every monday, which keeps things exciting. The staff are really friendly and make every effort to make sure their customers are happy. In fact, I witnessed the manager give a birthday girl froyo on the house. The self-serve concept is great! Flavours are always changing, but I like the original! And because it's priced by weight, how much it costs is entirely dependent on you!
