5	I think the best way to describe this event will be to tell you guys that I felt that I'm back in the playa for a few hours !Thank you for a great night !My review is for the main event and for the after party !!!
5	With the 2012 Burning Man ticket fiasco this event was as close as I'm going to get to the playa this year. Fortunately it was so good and so full of energy that the only thing I ended up missing was a good dust storm and having to wash playa dust out of my clothes. If the Dancetronauts come back to Vegas, they are worth taking the time to go see. When Lucky Lady Lucy fell and they kicked the amplifiers on and those massive Community speakers started thumping, it was like someone flipped on a transporter beam and put you right smack in the middle of Burning Man.  5 Stars for one of the best events I've attended in Vegas to date.
