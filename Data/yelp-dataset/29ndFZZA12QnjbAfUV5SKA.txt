3	Huge. Cool. Happening. Hundreds of artists have been leased cheap studio spaces, and with the three gallery spaces and communal spaces, even a "swap shop" where things are taken and given, there is a very good energy here. I have a friend in one studio and have met many of the other tenants, and attended several of their events. Lovely people, and great experiences. It's a little rough around the edges, as it is young still, but getting better. If you have a chance to come to an event or meet any of the artists, don't pass it up.
4	I have been to St Margaret's House for an exhibition opening and for the Open Studios event, this year. I really like the collective and the idea of having a bunch of cretives all working in the one ares, across a heap of different mediums. An opening at St Margaret's House is always a fun and welcoming affair. Really love visiting this place!
4	As Quinn says "it's huge" is not an understatement.  Lots of artists are resident here and are all very friendly and welcoming.  It good place to meet them is on the third floor where the communal kitchen is :)  This is where the coffee is happening!  It's just a coffee jug so please don't get too excited but it's a step better than instant coffee.  There are galleries too and they usually have something on it at least one if not two of them.  there are lift and toilets too.The art complex is very cool and has alot to embrace.
