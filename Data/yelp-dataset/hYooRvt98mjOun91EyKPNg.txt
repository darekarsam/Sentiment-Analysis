4	As Arby's go, this one is a bit above the rest. The manager clearly keep s a positive work environment which means people actively doing their job and making a pleasant experience for the customers. The food is always on that "pretty good" side of what fast food can be.

1	I must say... Arby's is one if the only "fast food" joints I go to and my favorite. I live within two blocks. HOWEVER. EVERY time I've been to this location, it's the WORST Arby's experience ever. I get the sand thing every time. Ultimate blt market fresh meal with curly fries and tea. Seems easy, right? Not so easy. Every time I've come here (again it's within one minute) I'm disappointed. Either tiny bacon bits instead of bacon strips, minimal bacon, or tonight !!!!! They had the nerve to serve my market fresh blt sandwich on a regular bun with roast beef. Roast beef!!!! I understand it was probably a new girl, but come on!!!! I didn't even eat it. My boyfriends onion rings were so hard they were worse than a Funyun, but not as tasty. I guess I may have to drive next door to jack in the box instead and risk the gut rot the next day. I believe it will be worth it.
