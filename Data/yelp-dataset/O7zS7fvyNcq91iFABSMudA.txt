1	For a fast food chain known for it's homogeneous franchise structure, there couldn't be much more inconsistency in the customer service.  I've been a long time fan of Subway and live close to this location.  Unfortunately, they have repeatedly let me down.The most recent offense - the dreaded curly long black hair that had to be pulled out of my mouth.  Needless to say, this ruined my appetite.  But...these things happen and as long as the restaurant makes up for it, I will typically let it slide.  So, I called the location and told them about my sandwich with a little something extra.  They said they'd call me back after speaking with the store manager.  I received a call several minutes later and was informed that I could bring in what I had left of the sandwich and they would remake or refund me for however much is left.  I ordered a footlong and discovered the hair in the last quarter of the sandwich, which meant only a partial reimbursement for a miserable experience.  I was infuriated and swore at the poor girl on the phone.  She passed the buck to her manager and said that he'd give me a call to discuss this further.  Yeah right....how about I just let the YELP* world decide on this poorly managed Subway's fate?
4	Once you get over the fact that this Subway is inside the gas station market,  you'll realize it's like any other Subway franchise. Workers are quick to respond to your order even during a lunch rush.You can gas up and the Shell and pick up a footlong!
