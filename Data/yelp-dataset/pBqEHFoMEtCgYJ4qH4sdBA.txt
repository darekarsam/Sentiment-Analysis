5	I have used Sonny's for auto repairs and regular maintenance for a couple of years. All of my family also use their service. I am an "older" guy and have searched for years for an honest auto repair shop. Sonny's is the first one that proved over time to be just that. They are a small shop and do excellent work at a very reasonable price. I have recomended Sonny's to all my friends and family.
5	Great customer service! I would definitely bring all my car repair needs here again.  We recently brought the car to a Big name car repair shop and was surprised at the quote that they gave me! This Big Name shop wanted to charge me $55 for a thermostat! I was referred to Sonny's by someone who used to work there and they said they could help me out. So I went to Sonny's and I was greeted by the owner Nathan. I was happily surprised when he told me the part would only cost me $22 plus labor! Nathan told me the job would take approximately three hours, he told me I could either wait at the shop waiting area or he could drop me home or the local casino until the job was done! After the car was done he even picked me up!  This was the best customer service I ever got from any car repair shop in my life!
5	I'm so thankful I found this place! I was referred to Sonny's by the geek squad at Best Buy. This is by far probably the best car shop I have ever been to. They are really nice and really seem to know what they are doing. But most of all, they are really honest with their prices and their communication! They rock!
