4	Way back when this used to be part of a used car lot.  Shortly after I moved to the area Staples took over the building and I have been coming here since.  Service varies depending on the folks working here at any given time.  This latest experience was very good.  I needed business cards and envelopes because of a move.  If I had just gotten the business cards they will print them while you wait and their prices have come down considerably over the last year.  Because my order was bundled with the envelopes I get to wait a couple of weeks.  And they now will ship it all to me at no extra charge.
1	I went to Staples for business card printing because I didn't like the under sized cards that I received online from Vista Print and Zazzle (Less than 3.5x2") and I wanted full size cards. Well, it seems that it's very hard to get decent business cards these days. It took the Staples print center 4 weeks, 5 trips and 3 times rejecting the cards before I had the 4 sets I ordered. I picked up the order in bits and pieces and in the end they weren't all the same color, which I didn't catch until too late because I had to send out the cards to my people over the weeks it took to get everything. Looking back, the experience was a nightmare. I do not recommend ordering anything from this branches print center. If they can't get 4 sets of business cards right and on time, what would happen with any big or complicated project I wonder.
1	I've used this location many times before and service was less than standard today i waited on hold to place a large order of buisness cards and flyers. I was rerouted to the same person who awnsered my call several times totaling 45 minutes on hold.I wouldnt recommend this location to anyone.Tempe locations have great service the peoria location has great service. This location is horrible. Every experience has been a bad one.
