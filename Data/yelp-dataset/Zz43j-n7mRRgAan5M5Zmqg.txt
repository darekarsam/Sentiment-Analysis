4	Pretty good. I've never had any complaints about this subway.
2	Price is fine for a $5 foot long...but bread was undercooked. That's a first.Bread was falling apart (Italian) and was not the same quality that I'm used to.
5	Best subway I've been to in a while. Everything tasted fresh and the service was awesome. Ryan talked the whole time and was still speedy quick.
