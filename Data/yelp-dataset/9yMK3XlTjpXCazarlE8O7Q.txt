5	They purchased Digiplex, the best part is the rewards card can be changed to Carmike Cinemas!
2	Another new name but the same overpriced stuff. The theater is getting more and more run-down looking. Maybe the new owners will spruce it up? I hope so--the building isn't very old...But expect more of the same so far with Carmike Cinemas as we have experienced with Digiplex and Ultrastar before it.
1	why does our theater keep getting bought out by all these shitty companies? amc or harkins please buy this theater in surprise, we beg of you!
3	The staff is really making an effort to be extra polite, extra interested, and extra helpful here at Carmike's. I suspect that the Digiplex's reputation of indifference is making it difficult for them to win back guests. We visited on Friday night to see John Wick. Movie was horrible but that's not the point. What I noticed was the real lack of guests here on a Friday night. There were only 4 other people in the big theater with us and that was very telling. There weren't many in the lobby either and the ticket takers mentioned it was a very slow night. I think if they do some community outreach programs that will make a difference in the perception of the theater and maybe win back some customers but they will need to get started before the holiday season or its going to be a loooong lonely winter for them.
