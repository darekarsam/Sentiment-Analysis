4	I was really happy to find an affordable and good sandwich shop on this side of town. All I would ever see were either overpriced bistros or cheap McDonald's and such. This almost secret place serves very fresh sandwiches and their takeaway coffee is decent as well, making it ideal if you have been shopping all day and fancy a quick bite!
3	Le Sandwich is an understated little sandwich bar on Frederick Street. I enjoyed the sandwich I had, but their soup wasn't particularly good. I think it suffers by comparison to some of its near neighbours (Thistle Sandwich Bar, Lime etc), as it's just not all that memorable.Overall, we said: "I'm fairly confident that you'll get a consistent product from them, but I think there are many better places in the neighbourhood. I keep saying this about places, then never following it up to verify, but I imagine it does good bacon rolls. Perhaps given that this month's Total Food Geeks theme is "retox", I should indulge in a few more hangovers followed by bacon rolls, all in the name of research, you understand."
