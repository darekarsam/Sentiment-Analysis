5	This square lies in the heart of Old Montreal, bordered on the north and south by the waterfront and City Hall. It's a vibrant, beautiful area, filled with outdoor terraces and bistros and cafes, paved in cobblestones and populated by artisans and musicians. There are narrow old alleyways off the central square, filled with photographers and painters and jewelers selling their wares. There are ivied courtyard restaurants and, yes, the usual array of touristy shops selling local tchotchkes.There's nothing better than having a glass of sangria at a table outside in the summertime here, watching the chic Montrealers and all the tourists go by. And in e evening, there are some nice clubs and restaurants to visit. Old Montreal is my favorite part of Montreal, and this old square is truly its heart.
