5	I have been going to this family medicine doctor's office for about 3 years.  I also take my 4 kids and my husband goes.  I really like the fact that I can just "walk-in" to the clinic anytime during business hours and be seen.  My wait times are usually very short and I am in and out quickly.  No more "making an appointment' to be seen.  They even have another office on Carefree Hwy that sees patients on Saturday mornings from 8-12.  So much better than going to Urgent Care if something comes up during a Friday night and I don't want to go to Urgent Care.  The front office staff are great.  I am remembered, which is great when most doctors don't.  My favorite NP is Faith Cutrona.  I just love her.  I tell all my friends and family about this place and so many have gone and had great experiences.  I thought I should share this with my Yelp friends, in case you are looking for a new Family Doctor.
5	I have been coming to this office for several years and can't say enough good things about it.  they have two lady Nurse Practitioners that are great.  I have not gone anywhere else for care since I found this office!!!
1	So I've been here several times They've given me unnecessary medications/antibiotics and never helped the root problemDue to the excessive medication they put me on I had to permanently stop breastfeeding my 7 month old baby simply because they pumped me full of medications for so long that my son refused to breastfeed after 2 months of not breastfeeding.They only care about making money because I've gotten several bills in the mail for all of their services which they said were covered by my insurance. I've been in twice before 4 and they have refused to see me. They're sign says new patients arrive by 4 and established customers by 4:30The front desk is always rude and unprofessional as wellWill never be back and never referring friends or family anymore.
