5	Amigos!I'm excited to tell you about very good Mexican food in Madison, WI! I'll be back to add some more info, but El Burrito Loco has been on this corner since about 2002 and what's this?! No Yelp review?! It's time.I had a the huge chicken burrito special at $7.  It could be the best tasting value in town! It had all the usual ingredients inside including, cheese, pinto beans, rice, a lot of fresh (stewed...don't be afraid - its good!) chicken and salsa. They are all wrapped up in a soft huge flour tortilla. yumm. I asked for the spicy salsa and it was just about right.  Oh and don't let me forget to tell you that it had a pretty big side of guacamole...and it was good!  Did I mention it was big?! See pix.I'm pretty sure they are only at this Capitol location during lunch time, but it's worth the trip. Tell Maggie Hi and that Raul (From San Diego, living in NYC since 2001) I said Hola!Let's open up a stand in NYC! Come on!Orale! See you next time I'm in town!~r

The tortillas were some of the best I've ever had.My only complaint is that it was a little heavy on cilantro, but that's not keeping me from going back for lunch again today.
