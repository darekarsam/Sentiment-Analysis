1	1st it's actually circle K. Ahhh run. Don't come at night time! They have to hire security guard sometimes because so much goes down. It's clean and everything but attracts the most ghetto crowd. Don't feel safe
4	It's not every day I whip out a review on a gas station, but this spot is super convenient for a fill up when returning your rental car if you're coming from north or west of the airport. Located on McDowell and about 15th street, they're usually a good 5 - 10 cents cheaper per gallon than most other spots, and you can fill up, pop on the 51 south which turns into 10 east after about 100 yards, exit the rental return exit a quarter of a mile later. I've never been in the convenience store itself, nor do I plan to, I just swipe my card, re-fuel and away I go. Sure, it's in a questionable locale, and the local homeless might come up and ask for some change, but you're in and out in a couple of minutes and on your way to return your rental.Happy Yelping Phoenix!
3	Cheap gas in a ghetto neighborhood.  It has less than 10 pumps and it's only on one side of the gas station.  Try not to come here after sunse.
