4	If you are a crazy U of I fan then you have to have the clothes to go with the attitude, yes?This is not the cheapest place to get your orange and blue on but they do have quality merchandise and a bit different variety than you see at other bookstores.  (They also, curiously enough have books here!  For classes!  What?)The Illini fan to whom I am married is 6'6" so it is hard to find Illini gear for him but they at least have an extended size rack here so he has managed to score a few items over the years.  They also have such cute baby clothes and as my eldest daughter is due in December, let's just say I may have gone a little crazy here last Saturday.If you come here to buy your Illini wear, you might want to hit their special sales on Mom's Weekend, homecoming, stuff like that.  Now I didn't do that this last time but I have in the past.Oskee Wow Wow, get your orange and blue here!
2	This is the official bookstore for the University of Illinois. The good parts are that they sell a wide selection of quality merchandise. Their employees are generally kind an friendly.There are, however, down sides. The Illini merchandise that is sold here is grossly overpriced. Their sales are good, but everything else will have you emptying your pockets. If you are a student, you will find this out even on a greater scale. Many of the textbooks that students need are sold only here and therefore, the prices are jacked up beyond belief.In addition, it's not necessarily fair to the bookstore since it was an executive decision, but all CHIEF memorabilia and references are removed from the bookstore. Shameful.
