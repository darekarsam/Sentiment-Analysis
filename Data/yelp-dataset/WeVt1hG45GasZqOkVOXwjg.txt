1	Ordered but then she kept telling me all their different specials. Finally said ok to 3 roast beefs. Just got home. Order totally wrong. Not going back.
1	Our visit at this Arby's was a joke! The couple of clowns working around 8:00pm on 06/08/14, were as slow as snails and had the customer service skills of a piece of plywood. Seemed that there was one cook, one blonde girl cleaning the dining area, and a shift manager, named Jasmine. The shift manager continually stated "I'll be right with you" again and again. At first, it was understandable, due to drive through orders, but then she just stopped and started talking to the blonde girl, giggling. When she finally got to us at the register, she was rude and unprofessional, sporting a look like we were inconveniencing her. After we gave her our order, she didn't bother to recite it back, but instead, gave me the total, swiped my card and slammed down the receipt with a pen and said, "I need you to sign this." $15/hr, eh? The food was great, but the service was insanely terrible and we will never go back.
