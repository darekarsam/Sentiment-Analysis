2	This is really not anything special. Problem is... All the breakfast restaurants blow in this area. The service is bad, the hostess is insane, and the food is reeaaaaaaaallllyyy average.
1	I only come here because for some reason or another, it's my best friend's favorite brunch place. I can't stand it. The hostess is insane and pissed off at the world, the waitress I had wouldn't even look at me when I asked for ketchup (let alone actually BRING me the ketchup. I had to get it myself), the food is average, my plate was cold, the coffee is nasty... shall I go on?
5	You get a home sense when you enter this place. The service is friendly, the food is quickly served(the longest i've had to wait was 30 min, the least i had to wait is roughly 10 min). What i love the most here is that they serve you with a smile ALL THE TIME!! I swear i have never ever had a bad experience here. The serving is huge, the price is good and it's always fresh. The pictures i'll post will speak for themselves!!
