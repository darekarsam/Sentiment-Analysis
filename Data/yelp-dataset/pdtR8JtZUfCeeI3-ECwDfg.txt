5	Very professional job. Quite happy with the results and would recommend it to anyone who wants to have solar screens installed.  Two thumbs up for Mr. Goodman!
5	I had been considering purchasing solar screens for my house to cut down on glare and high energy costs.  I contacted another company which came out to give me an estimate, but when the installer showed up he told me he would not be able to do one of the upstairs windows because a patio overhang prevented direct access to the window.  I knew there was a way around that obstacle, but decided to cancel the deal and contact someone else.  That company was Eclipse Window owned by Glenn Goodman.  He came out and gave me a more competitive estimate and also offered a 10% military discount.  He measured the windows that same day and 2 days later called to schedule the installation. He was able to install that upstairs screen with little effort.  He had to come back and redo one of the windows which was not measured correctly, but did so promptly and at no extra cost. The screens look great and while I have not yet received an electric bill to determine the amount of savings, they do provide added shade inside the rooms which also feel cooler.  Great company, nice owner and quality workmanship.
