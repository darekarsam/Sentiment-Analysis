1	These people were recommended to us by our fantastic retired pool guy. So we figured we could trust them.WRONG. They came out twice within a month to fix our pool. The first time they re-plumbed part of it because they said that air was getting into the pump $$$$$. Second time, a little over a month later the same thing happened. They claim they guarantee their work. They DO NOT. Had to re-plumb again and said it was our fault that the pool was low on water (we had shut the system off because it wasn't working so naturally the water was low.) Charged us $$$$ again. They tell you it is something different each time so they can make you pay more money.Less than a week and it has stopped working again. We called them again and their story was our pool was old and it was our fault????? If you are in the business of fixing pools and you cannot do the work then SAY SO. But, if you are incompetent you can keep charging people and lie. BEWARE. We are now looking for an honest Pool Repair Service. Avoid Swimming Pool Service & Repair unless you have a lot of money to throw down the drain.
5	Got an estimate with Andy Good. Hes super friendly and attentive. Knows the answer to every question and   also gives his professional opinion when needed, then later had a repair done and felt the work was on point and the cost was very fair and reasonable :) great family business!
5	Okay, please read this entire review. You will be considered a complete moron if you do not select this company to do your pool service, we recently had ours redone and I have never in my life received the customer service and care at this high of a level as you do from the people, especially Andy he made everything simple and took care of every single question that we had and trust me there were a lot of them. If I ever own another pool I will not choose anyone else but this company! you need to do the same 5 stars hands down... Thanks Guys/Gals U Rock!!!
