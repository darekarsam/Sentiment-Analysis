5	I would give them more stars if I could.   I had other company out here who charged way too much and then wanted another $550 to remove the hive.   I was lucky enough to call Queen B and am thrilled.   The came out immediately, put in a pest strip, said there was no "hive" and all for a reasonable price.   Please pass the name of Queen Bee on to your friends because they are honest, reliable, and reasonable.
5	I called Queen B Pest Control because I had been seeing spiders.Donny came out the same day.He gave me a price no other company could beat and did a great job.I would highly recommend this company to anyone.
5	I contacted Queen B because I had gnats and every home remedy I tried wasn't working. Don came out the same day to take a look and returned the next day to do the job. Although the pesky critters didn't want to go down easy I called Don out again and he returned to finish them off. So glad there gone for good. I highly recommend QB affordable and they can get the job done most likely less than most of the other companies out there.Marilyn S.
