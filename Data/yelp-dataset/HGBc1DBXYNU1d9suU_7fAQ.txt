2	I'm on the fence about giving this one a one-star review. The food is fine....when you finally get it. I appreciate that the food is basically made fresh/almost made-to-order these days at this location, but it takes forever and a day to get it. This location is always severely understaffed. They could use at least 1-2 more employees working the front and back line. It's definitely no longer "fast food".I wish that Wendy's would buy them out and use their breakfast line to compete with McDonalds, Burger King, and Bojangles. (Forget about Biscuitville..UGH) That would be a major coup.Hardees definitely has the best biscuits and are highly underrated. Best dang fast-food gravy biscuit in town. Their Cinnamon & Raisin biscuits are better than any of the other fast food joint's "sweet" offerings in the mornings.Your pal,Walter
3	Food is good, speed is good when there are few people in the restaurant and drive-thru, staff is moderately friendly. Most of the tables looked clean.
1	Saturday afternoon. nobody in front of us. we gave our order then just sat and waited.... we asked twice to see if anyone was there only to be asked for our order again....then we had to pull over and wait for our food.........15 mins so far and counting...... wow
