5	John (owner) is someone I trust my families safety to.  I know that when he tells me something, it is the truth.  He is good at what he does and does not charge you a fortune to fix it. He has inspected a problem with my car and told me to take it to a specialist to get it fixed.  John is a good chirstian man and he will NOT do you wrong.
5	I've taken my car here several times now, only for my yearly inspections, but they always get me in and out quickly. It's been the same folks every time i've been there. They are super friendly and seem to be trustworthy and reliable. It's the kind of place where people keep coming back. It's a small building, i think just the 2 car garage. Not even sure of the range of services offered, but if it's not something he can fix, he'll let you know without faking it and charging you for something unnecessarily (saw him check under a guy's hood while i was waiting and tell him where to take he needed to take it).
1	I would give Carolina Auto Repair no stars if possible. I took my car here for a simple oil change. When I picked my car up and started to drive home my hood flew open and broke my windshield also destroyed my hood.John (the owner) refused to pay for the damages even though it was clearly his fault. He was very disrespectful to my father and I while lying about who actually did the work on my car.We are now going to sue him for damages.
