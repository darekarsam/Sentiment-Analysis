4	I wouldve never known this little gem was here! Buttttt they are also an authorized UHaul dealer.. I reserved over the phone, they are very easy to arrange with. Wally and  his wife are both very nice.. I needed the truck for a few extra hours and they went out of their way to accomodate :)  will write a second review for the UHaul later.. Anyways their market is incredible!! They have all sorts of imported coffees and the traditional arabic hand held expresso maker.. Which i also bought! Not only did Wally advise me on which coffee would suit my taste.. His wife also explained how much to use and exactly how to use the expresso maker.  My first time making it and it was delicious.  They also had a eatery inside but i was unable to try it as i was in a rush... The store itself was very tidy and Wally takes great pride in honest service. I would reccommend this 1 stop shop to anyone in the area! Dont forget to try the coffee! Thanks Wally! :)
5	My favorite aspect of this fantastic little middle eastern market / U-Haul dealer is their excellent gyros sandwiches.  Service is the best and genuinely warm and friendly.
5	Had a ham sub with veggies and a drink because I saw the sign outside; sub and drink for 4.99. It was great and the bread was delicious. They said they baked it themselves. I finished off with some chocolate ice cream which was good too.  I had my son who is 8 months old, with me and they were so friendly.  He liked the ice cream too.  They even gave him a sucker. Very nice people and great food. Next time I will try a gyro.
