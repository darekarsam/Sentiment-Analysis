4	Ness has super cute upscale tartan and tweed (and other) clothing in unexpected colors (pink, green, aqua). Always worth a visit to see what is new.
4	Ness is a very dinky little store on the Royal Mile, selling tasteful tartan for a trendier audience.They sell a number of gorgeous dresses and shirts that have a wholesome, provincial quality to them. Amongst their lovely knitwares, they sell some good quality, well starched cotton skirts, tops and jackets.The clothing in here is moderately priced but the quality speaks for itself. Clothes look cosy and durable without being boring. Instead, they are brightly coloured and contemporary while still being suited to our terrible weather!The staff are very welcoming and I'd recommend it to people looking for a fresh take on the otherwise stagnant tartan littering Edinburgh's high streets. Very cheerful and charming indeed!
3	Ness is a fabulous place to go on the Royal Mile to get tartan items for younger girls.  They have a modern take on tweed and tartan with bright colors, bows, etc.  It's personally not my taste, but if I had some younger girls to buy gifts for, it would be perfect.
