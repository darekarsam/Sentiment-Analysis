2	Staff needs to be better educated! The dome on our pool filter developed a leak at the valve stem, causing water to spurt out the top like a fountain every time the filter turned on. We thought this would be a simple fix.....which eventually it was....after we went to another Leslie's, at Tatum and Greenway, where they were amazing! There is an older gentleman who works at this location at Tatum and Bell. He is knowledgeable and explains things well. However, the rest of the staff is lacking. The day we went into the store about our leaking filter, the gentleman was not there, only a young girl and an older woman.  The young girl had no idea of what to do to fix our problem; the older woman promptly pulled out the large catalog and told us our only fix would be to replace the whole dome, to the tune of $700! That answer did not seem right, so we went to the Leslie's at Tatum and Bell. Like I said before, they were amazing! They did not have the part we needed, but the salesman there wrote down exactly what we should buy at Ace Hardware, for the grand total of $3! Now our pool filter works great with no leaks, and we saved $697!
4	I have not been impressed with the Leslie's by my house since they never have anything that fits my older Shasta pool. So I was told about this Leslie's store since they bought out an old Shasta pool store. They had everything I needed and was super helpful. Just peeves me that not every Leslie's carries the same products
