5	Delicious Chinese food in a great, though sometimes cheesy, atmosphere.  Rice and vegetables from Sichuan House was one of my first solid foods as a child, so I may be slightly biased, but the food from Sichuan House is top notch.  Egg and spring rolls are both good, and the number of vegetarian options is great.  The lo mein is always perfectly cooked; the buddhist medley is full of fresh veggies and huge pieces of fried tofu.  Lunch options are cheap, and if you arrive with a big enough group, you can sit in the private room in the back.  The service is always great, and the food is some of the best I've ever had.  Get some take out or eat in, but definitely try Sichuan House.
1	Frequently get take out from this place. Food usually fairly decent. Except we found some type of flying bug in the bottom of our rice container. Called to complain and they offered 20% off our next bill and did not sound surprised by our find. Considering the money we have spent there over the years I was highly upset. But they seemed to care less. Guess I have to drive to sesame next time.
5	This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the South Hills.  I'm often in the area during the afternoons, and the Sichuan House makes for an excellent and inexpensive lunch!  My favorite is the Cashew Chicken, and they don't skimp on the chicken.  I always leave with a full stomach, and that's just the lunch portion!  The prices and portions go up for the dinner crowd, but the food is always worth it.  The staff here are very attentive and friendly, and very gracious upon exit.  The decor is ho-hum, and anything but elegant, but you unnecessarily pay more for fancy atmosphere at some other area Chinese restaurants.  Highly recommended!
