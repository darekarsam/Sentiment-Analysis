5	We've hired Blackwood on a few of our recent Los Angeles projects and have been completely thrilled with the level of competency.  Not only do they have the best solutions for any of your DIT, VTR and camera requirements, but Rob Anderson brings a level of enthusiasm that is unmatched.  Rarely do you find someone who is so dedicated to seeing a project through to it's best possible ending.  Rob is keen to create beautiful work, and will go out of his way to make sure you've got the right solution to any need.  I couldn't recommend Blackwood higher.
5	Working with the guys at Blackwood Cinema was just fantastic.  I have worked with many production companies over the years... These guys REALLY CARE!  They genuinely want you to be happy with the work they do for you.  That's a really nice quality you don't often see in companies that all too often treat you like an order number in a job cue.  From start to finish, Bert Archer and his team were on it.  Professional, timely, and very reasonable.  They kept me in the loop on editing revisions just enough so I felt involved, but not burdened by the project.  I have been recommending them to all my friends in the entertainment industry.  Can't wait to utilize them again soon!!
4	Got a killer deal on a Red Dragon package. Driver was an hour late to set due to a miscommunication but everything worked out great and rob more than made it up to us by throwing in a few freebies. Great guy over at Blackwood who will take a moment to get to know you. Wouldn't go anywhere else for Red rentals.
