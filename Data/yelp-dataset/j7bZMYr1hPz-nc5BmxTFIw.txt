5	Great little used book shop right in the middle of the public market.  They also have a selection of new books by Pittsburgh authors.
5	Great little gem in Bloomfield - lots of interesting finds, including a selection of rare and vintage historic books. They also have a nice little selection of kid's books, which can be invaluable for parents. The owner also hosts a lot of poetry and reading nights. I always pick up something interesting here!
5	A very sweet used bookstore in Bloomfield. I passed some time there on a weekday afternoon and had a chair all to myself. The philosophy and sociology sections were terrific, and I found a copy of something I'd been seeking for many years. I browsed the fiction section, and they had a pretty solid selection of writers in well-preserved editions.Additionally, it's just down the street from The Big Idea, so it's a really nice way to spend an afternoon - walking through Bloomfield, getting coffee, and popping into those spots. I'd been a little down on the local bookstore scene since moving to Pittsburgh, and really hope this place keeps in business.
