4	I eat here once a week. Amir is a chain, but they aren't all the same. This one is good. For me it's about the potatoes, which are fresh and tasty with that garlic mayo sauce. In some places the potatoes are soggy and tasteless.
5	Not all Amir are the same. This one is especially good. Every time I've eaten there I've been very satisfied.Avoid the one on St-Denis... it's gross.
5	Huge quantity, pretty good quality, and overall a pleasant experience.
5	Love this Amir!! They aren't all the same for some reason. I guess they are individually owned. But I will go out of my way to get Amir from here as opposed to another Amir. The quality is best, the food is fresh, the quantities are HUGE... Love this place!
