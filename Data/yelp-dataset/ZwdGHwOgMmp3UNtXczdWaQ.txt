4	I've been on a journey for a barber for the three years I've been in the Charlotte region. Until recently, I'd been seeing a stylist in Huntersville who did a good job, but I was in the mood to try something different. Decided to give the Modern Haircutters a chance between appointments and I'm glad I did.I found I really liked the approach Phil took to my style - different, a gradual rise on the side, and a bit 50s-ish. That I can also get a shave and a shoeshine in the same trip? Awesome. Reminds me of the sort of barber shops I left behind in NYC. I'll be making it a usual spot going forward.
