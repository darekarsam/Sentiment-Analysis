2	This place is a throw back to another time. An ugly time from the 70's and 80's. They haven't changed, but they should. I've often felt like I'm in a prison cafeteria waiting for my portion of food. And if you've been here late enough you even feel like you might have to fight to keep your food!
3	I liked Lafleur.  It may seem dated but that's nostalgic in my books.  Kind of how many La Belle Province still look a little stuck in time this place is a bit so what?  The food is ok and it's a quick place to get a bite. Hot dogs?  Poutine?  That's a magical combo yes?  If you're looking for a quick fast meal and you feel like having fast food I'd rather come here than McDonald's and yes they also have smoked meat and burgers too.  Just remember trio = combo (fries, drink) but dont' forget about poutine.
3	I thought this place used to be much more run down.  I'm pretty sure they've done some renos.  It looks like any other fast food resto with booths and such.  It's too bad they only have one cash open, a huge line, and this giant wraparound space to pick up your order which really could've been more efficiently designed.  The poutine here is good.  The cheese could be squeakier.  I'm not into steamies.  They sell Pogos too.
