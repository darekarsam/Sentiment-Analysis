2	Typical Subway, clean restrooms, nice employees. Hey, it's a Subway, what do you want?
4	Not entirely sure why this place is rated 2 stars. It's a standard Subway, and I'm a fan of Subway. Really the only thing working against this location is the awful, awful little and often packed parking lot of the overall shopping area. If it's a busy day in the overall complex, I have to give this Subway a pass.Since the lot wasn't too bad a couple days ago I stopped to grab some dinner and they quickly got my 6" sub ready to go - in fact a different employee came out from the back to assemble my food so I wouldn't have to wait for the group in front of me to finish their order before I got mine. Seeing as the group in front of me hadn't quite decided what they wanted, I definitely appreciated this.Anyway, I was literally in and out within about four or five minutes - got my chicken sandwich toasted, got my toppings and Chipotle sauce, paid, boom. Everything was well stocked on the toppings bar, the bread was perfectly toasted and didn't crumble, and most importantly I left with a soft raspberry cheesecake cookie. Yum!Thanks for being my go to, Subway - it's good to have somewhere to grab a bite that's affordable, yummy, fast, and not nearly as bad for me as most fast food options!
