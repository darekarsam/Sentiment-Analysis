3	The location is unassuming, but inside the restaurant is comfortable.  The food is okay, with a range of prices.  Service was attentive even though they were busy.
5	One of the best Greek restaurants I've tried. The service was excellent, the atmosphere pleasant and the food was fantastic. Will definitely try again. Located in a strip mall, but aside from that, top notch.
3	The food here is always decent. I highly recommend the mousaka dish. I find though, for the kind of atmosphere, location, and level of service, it's a bit overpriced. I find that the waits are longer than expected (after ordering) and meals come out one at a time, as opposed to together.
4	The food here is good quality.  And the portions for the entrees/mains are quite large.  Worthwhile trying if you live in the area and like Greek food
4	Taramusalata, calamari, cheeses galore!  Delicious appetizers and super-satisfying pork souvlaki dinner.  I couldn't eat another bite and everything was finely seasoned without being salty.  They have a number of repeat-patrons from the way they chatted to the customers as if they saw them all the time.
5	Best Greek food in the city. Small and intimate restaurant with lots of character and atmosphere. Staff are warm and friendly and the food is top notch.Also great for families with children.One of my favorite restaurants to visit.
