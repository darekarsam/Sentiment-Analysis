5	Great place for cigars.  Great variety and selection.  The lounge is very nice with 5 large televisions.  They also have poker night which I would enjoy if. I knew how to play.  Very friendly staff.  Looking forward to the coffee house opening soon.
5	I was Impressed!  A friend who owns a cigar store in Portland suggested I check this place out: great suggestion. The humidor has a decent inventory and I was impressed at the choices. There is a nice smoking area inside and some excellent outside tables. I wish I was closer. Nice owner and excellent customers.
5	Stopped in to see what this shop was all about.  The staff was knowledgeable, the selection was top notch, the lounge was comfortable, and the crowd was friendly.  A great place to watch football.
