3	In the classy mall that is home to Oggi's, Barro's, FirehouseSubs, and Ace Hardware there is a dollar store. Actually, justdrop a penny and make that a 99 cents store. I come here fornon-food items. Paper plates, paper towels, cleaning fluids,and stuff like that. I'm scared of the food here. The vegetableslook like they're moments away from expiration o'clock. I wouldalso check the expiration dates on any cans or bottles you gethere. An acquaintance in low places once mentioned that as a truck driver with an addiction to unmentionable substances, hewould once in a while steal cargo from other truckers. And guesswhat kind of place readily accepts this kind of stuff no questionsasked? Yup. 98 cents stores. This place is a penny more expensiveso I'm sure that kind of stuff never happens here. They also haveCDs and DVDs. I once tried to sell a bunch of old CDs to Bookman's.The only thing they bought were the crappy dollar CDs of completelyobscure crap bands that I bought in this store. Go figure!The best thing about this place, though, is the fact that they have99 cent pregnancy tests right by the cashiers. Hey - even if it turnsout to be wrong - it was only 99 cents!
3	As far as 99 cents stores go, this is a fairly good location.Lots of good brand name options and the occasional $1.99 item.They to slack on check out, sometimes only 1 lane with many customers.
