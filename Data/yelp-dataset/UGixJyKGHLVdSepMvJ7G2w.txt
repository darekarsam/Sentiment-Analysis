3	Went to this Pharmaprix in Alexis Nihon Plaza to get some generic acetaminophen with codeine. The store was busy (especially in the rear pharmacy area), with clusters of people at the rear counter (both the drop-off prescription area as well as the pick-up area), and every seat along the rear wall was occupied. Many people were standing, waiting. It was a really small area, not well designed to accommodate all the customers who use this pharmacy. (The rest of the store was small, too, but is well stocked in basic pharmacy fare. Not sure it'd have anything specific, though, outside of most commonly asked for stuff). Anyhow, I asked the lady behind the pharmacy counter for their largest bottle of generic 222's, with the longest expiration date. I got a bottle of 200 pills for $14.99. (With tax, it was over $17). I thought this high, but the lady assured me, that's how much it costs, and the brand name 222's cost $25 for a bottle of 200. I purchased a bottle. Later that day at my parents' house, my mother told me she purchased a bottle of 200 such generic pills at the Jean Coutu pharmacy on Sherbrooke St. that same day for $9.99. I saw the receipt. So.... Same product costs 33% more at Pharmaprix. Interesting. I think I'll do the rest of my pharmacy shopping at Jean Coutu from here on in.
