2	I had a mixed feeling about this Guess outlet store.  The prices were decent as it should be because it's an outlet store, but the selection was very small.  The men's section was decent, which I tend to take a peek occasionally because I like their men's tees.  The women's section was scarce with limited tops and pants.  If you are a Guess shopper, I suggest that you skip this outlet store and go to a mainstream Guess store.
4	Good service & good clothes
5	I would have put 4 stars because the store was organized and there was always someone available to help but Adril made it a 5. We asked if there were any of the item we wanted in the back after watching someone take the last one. He checked to and did not find any. He then asked if we would like to order the item online and have it shipped to our house for free. He checked 3 different item SKU numbers, going back and forth to the back of the store to get numbers off of the different items, to make sure it was the exact one we wanted. He was also very nice the whole time. This was the weekend of Black Friday. Adril made the experience a pleasant one.
