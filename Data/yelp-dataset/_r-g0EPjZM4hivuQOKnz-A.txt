1	What a crock. First I got stuck in traffic and was 10 min late after calling. Not willing to work with me at all. So by time my massage started it was 15 min after my original start time. So I got a 45 min massage that was just ok.  I get a massage about every 6 weeks and this was nothing to rave about at all. Then afterwards when I went to pay, I swear I booked a $60 hour massage and when I went to check out it was $75. So I just paid $75 for a mediocre 45 min massage. I am so upset. I feel like I was taken advantage of. Plus I had a $55 coupon that I was given at my yoga place but unfortunately I forgot it. They wouldn't take my word for it or work with me. I would NOT suggest anyone bother going here. I left in tears I was so upset. There are so many other better places to go.
5	If you are pregnant - or just need the best massage ever - you need to go to Babies and Bellies. Angie and her team specialize in prenatal massage.  I started going to her when I was pregnant for deep tissue massage.  She was always able to work out the "kinks" so I had a comfortable pregnancy.  I have continued going to see both Angie and Kaleigh for the 18 months since giving birth because there is no where in town to get a better massage. They recently added yoga classes to the mix. Plus offer daycare during classes and massage.  They understand the needs of moms and work hard to make you comfortable.
