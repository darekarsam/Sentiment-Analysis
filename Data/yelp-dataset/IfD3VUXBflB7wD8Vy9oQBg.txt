5	I adore Steve Madden shoes.The staff here are always polite, helpful, and fun.I was able to return a pair of shoes i bought there even though i lost the receipt.
1	Never GO HERE. EVER. First they robbed me of 150 dollars for a straight year until one day I decided to call after finding the receipt of the shoes I returned in an old bag. even after everything, my "check" got lost in the mail .. and never got sent. So I had to go out of my way to pick up my money that was suppose to be returned to me one year ago.
5	Store is pretty small. Could be bigger because i'm sure it gets super crowded on the weekends. No a huge selection of shoes but it's a pretty good selection. The sale was a good idea though how you scratch the number off the card. Employees were nice. Store is pretty hidden though which sucks since it is a nicer brand.
1	Selection was limited and the styles were all ghetto. The worst part is that the salespeople are rude and don't even bother to greet me when I'm standing right in front of them and they didn't even have any other customers there!!!
1	I love Steve Madden shoes. First let me start off by saying every time I go in there. Not a dam sales associate greets or even help out. Like I walk in & 5 dumb snobby chicks thinks its okay to just stare without helping until I leave. Like go work somewhere else. Seriously!  Next time when I go. I'll probably just try a whole bunch of shoes on. Leave it out so they'l) have something to do :) . That's what they get for treating there customers.
