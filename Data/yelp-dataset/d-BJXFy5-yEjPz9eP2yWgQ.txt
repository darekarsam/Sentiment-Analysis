5	Best colombian food in town!  The empanadas are th BEST! So delicious, and fresh! ... Don't know what to eat? Here you go, empanadas to start, bandeja paisa with a natural juice to drink, then empanadas to take home... You are welcome...  Felipe and Naty
5	By far some of the best Colombian food in Charlotte!  My wife & I have ordered food to go about 4 times so far.  Every time the food has been great!
4	Food was excellent!! Had Mini Bandeja Paisa which I haven't seen one of these since I left NYC. Also empanadas are fresh & very good. Overall food was great waiter was very nice & even the owner came to our table to greet us & make sure everything was ok. I would've give 5 stars, but food took a little longer than usual. We are definitely coming back again.
1	The worse experience in a restaurant!  My wife ask for a plate that it was overcooked and salty. Told the owner and the plate was replaced with something different. And when the bill came was charge for the 2 plates!!. Never in my life heard of this before!  Poor customer service! !! Oh by the way food wasn't that great either! !
3	Let me start out by saying nice people when you first walk in, very welcoming.  I ordered the Bandeja Paisa, a Bandeja mini and Tostones with chicken.  Overall the food was good.
4	Tried their steak sandwich and empanadas for the first time ...umm it was good...i've definitely had better.. steak sandwich was good but it was super super tough to eat. Meaning the meet was super tough to chew but The empanadas were okay my girl is Puerto Rican and she really didn't like it& sandwich was 9$ bucks apiece and empanadas were 3$ I will probably try it again
5	My husband and I went to have lunch there by far the best colombian food! Best empanadas and Natural juices! And the service is awesome I just hope it stays like that! So far I love it!
