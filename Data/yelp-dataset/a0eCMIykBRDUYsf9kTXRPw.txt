4	The Royal Mile Gallery stocks top quality prints all with a Scottish theme. Most of the prints here show Edinburgh, both the old Edinburgh and the modern day one. It's so interesting to see the old Edinburgh as it was and to think how much it's changed and how different it would have been not so long ago.When I popped in the other day it was busy, full of tourists who were probably looking for souvenirs and a print is the perfect souvenir, as it will fit flat and perfectly in your suitcase and whenever you look at the print you bought you will be transported back to your travel to Scotland's beautiful capital city. Of course, these prints aren't just aimed at tourists and would look great in any home.
4	The Royal Mile Gallery, situated in an area littered with tourist shops, brings a touch of class to the street.Selling old prints of Scotland, old maps and some classic Victorian prints of old paintings, it's a great glimpse into Edinburgh's past. Prints aren't that expensive, come in various sizes (some easy to take home!) and all older prints derived from authentic sources, so are dripping in history.For the quality and choice in here, it's not even that expensive. Definitely worth a look if you are looking for something with more substance than the surrounding tourist traps.
