5	This store is new to me and new to the neighborhood, and being the product junkie I am I had to check it out.  This store is all about product. It's not like a GNC or a Vitamin Shoppe as it's very open and minus a couple of display tables all the merchandise lines the walls of the store.  They had product lines that were new to me but also ones I am familiar with like ON, BPI, Quest, and Dymatize. The pricing on the products I asked about was fair and not jacked up like you find at other nutrition stores.  Customer service was great and the associate seemed very knowledgeable. I know I'll be back when I need to replace my supplement staples.
5	Great store & great service! I'm visiting from San Diego & just like home they had all my products. Thank you, Nutrishop! :)))
5	I'm a fairly avid nutritionist and take my health seriously and to get the best out of my workout each day supplements along with proper nutrition is key. That's where NutriShop comes in. They have an excellent selection of high quality products for your health needs. With a knowledgeable staff (John) you can be assured you'll get the products you need to meet your fitness goals. Its an absolute plus we have a NutriShop right in the neighborhood.
