5	My wife an I rented two scooters for three days and had a blast. This was way cheaper then a taxi. The customer service was excellent and they delivered on time and picked up from our hotel. Will be sure to call on out next trip. Thanks
5	Great way to see and explore the Las Vegas Strip. Me and 3 friends rented scooters had a great time.
5	My husband and I rented two mopeds for our 2 day stay in Las Vegas!  We loved having them!!  Eddie meet us at our hotel with them. Showed us how they worked and then sent us on our way. He was always a text away and checked up on us halfway through the trip. We were able to zip through Vegas and didn't pay one cab fair!  I give JamScooters 5 stars and Eddie 6 stars!!  Great device. Definitely recommend using them!!  Thanks!!
5	Great bargain for 3 days, came with helmets and lock.  Call the number first, two locations and one doesnt have a storefront yet.  The owner is very helpful and friendly, wanted me to have a great experience.  I will be a return customer!
