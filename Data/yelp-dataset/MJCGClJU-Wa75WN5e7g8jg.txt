2	For a sports bar it is mediocre.  If you're not looking for a sports bar to watch a game, don't even bother, (you should probably start reading the names of restaurants).There is ample seating, but to me almost feels like a large cafeteria.  Both nights I've been were very quiet, maybe the location, I am not sure.We ordered your typical sports bar food, nachos, wings, mozza sticks, (yum), and of course draft beers...The positives are that it is plenty large enough for a big group, TVs in view from anywhere you sit, you don't have to get dressed up, and they speak fluent French.
1	THE WORST SERVICE EVER!!! NOT like other C.A.S your better off @ the one's Downtown where at least there they know how treat their customers.
