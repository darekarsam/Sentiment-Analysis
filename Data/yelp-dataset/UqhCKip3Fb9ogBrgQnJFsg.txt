1	Until the owner of this business teaches his employees a few customer service skills, I'll take my business elsewhere.
5	Great Neighborhood Pool store that carries anything you need. I always make sure I buy from the local businesses in my area
1	I used to patronize this store exclusively for all my pool needs. Usually on a Saturday.Staff was usually younger high-school aged guys that were very helpful and knowledgeable. Service was great and prices were competitive.However, during my last 2 visits to the store I was "helped" by the owner. He was rude, dismissive, uncaring and generally just an a$$ to me. I have never and will never go back. I can get any part I need online cheaper than here or any other brick and mortar store.
