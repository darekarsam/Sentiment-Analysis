5	Great service with these guys! Made an appointment, was told the ETA, sat in the nice, clean waiting area with football to keep me entertained. Took care of my oil change with my 'free' coupon, I didn't need a tire rotation since I just got it done a few weeks ago, but they checked the tread, cleaned the rims, waxed the tires, etc. Definitely more than I expected to get with just a free oil change coupon. The guy came out to my car with me to inspect another thing I had a question about and found out they had addressed it without me even having to ask. Totes recommend them- finished the job in less time than I was told, nice guys, professional service.
5	Excellent!!!  What a terrific experience!  I brought my 2006 Chrysler Pacifica in for a check up and some repairs, and they did a phenomenal job taking care of both my car, and me personally.  Big O Tires on Warner is the place to go!  Their customer service is fantastic. They were courteous, considerate, thorough, and honest. Their shop is state of the art with all  the hi-tech equipment for auto services.  The showroom, waiting areas, and even the bathrooms are meticulously cared for providing an enjoyable experience.  Ryan and his crew are all very friendly and professional.  Besides taking care of the repairs, and general services that I requested, they provided a complete, detailed overview of my cars condition, and recommended upkeep services. Their prices were very reasonable and they offered great specials. I can't say enough great things about their shop, and them as people.  It is so refreshing to have honest people take care of our cars, and services that match the quality I appreciate, and aspire too, myself.  You're fantastic!  Thanks again for taking care of me, and my Pacifica.  Cliff
