5	I was refered by a friend to these guys. Walked out this morning to a leaking water heater and he had it replaced before 1:30. What took him so long? He gave me my different options for a water heater, and after researching them found the one that would fit my application (hole in the wall) an hour away. No problem he said. Got it done. Even came to my work to get paid. Came home to a perfectly installed water heater that is set better then the one we had for the last ten years. Highly recommend these guys.
5	If you need help with your plumbing, please call Chad.  I had a horrible experience with my former plumber, and Chad came through like a champ.  The job was done quickly and professionally.  He explained what I needed and actually cleaned up after he repaired what I needed.  I would highly recommended him and his team.
1	Don't pay them ahead of time. No pun intended, I paid him $2000 to do a tankless hot water heater and he said he would  be back the next day. It's been five months now and he hasn't even called me back message after message. Not to be trusted.
