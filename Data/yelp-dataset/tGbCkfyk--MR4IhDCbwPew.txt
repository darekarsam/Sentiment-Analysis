3	My Mom changed from a grass lawn to desert landscape.  Mike, the owner was very difficult to work with and unwilling to make "satisfaction" his guarantee as he states in his company policy!  End result is satisfactory, however incomplete.  We will not recommend this company to anyone.
5	Mike O'Neil has been looking after our landscaping needs for years. We have never had any problems and he has always been responsive to our needs and to any issues that have arisen. We have recommended him to friends and family and he has always ensured that all work is completed to our satisfaction before any money changes hands. We have even had him work with artificial grass and Christmas lighting and his guys have always been up to the job. Can't recommend earthworks enough!
4	Mike and crew are currently converting my lawn to water-smart landscaping and so far, so good.  (Oct 2014)  I explained my needs and concerns to Mike and he listened.  He created a design plan for me that met my needs, and was open to discussion and changes.  He then provided me with a written estimate and a revised plan than he took to my HOA for approval and submitted to SNWA for a rebate.  He answers my questions directly and returns my calls.  He's been reliable and done what he has said that he would do.  I have no complaints and I look forward to seeing the final results.  I anticipate upon completion that I will be able to recommend him to others.
