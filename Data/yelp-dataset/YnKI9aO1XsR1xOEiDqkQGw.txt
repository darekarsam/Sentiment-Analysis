1	Beware this company is the worse.One star is more than I would give Apria Healthcare but there aren't any minuses. If you can avoid this place, run away, even if you have to pay cash. Including Healthcare in their name is a disgrace. The so called therapists are a batch of badly trained, uncaring, ineffective idiots. The customer service and quality control group are horribly under trained and basically stupid. They sent me the wrong products over and over and over again. Though I informed my insurance company, they were paid anyway. I tried to return the items but as I had opened the boxes, I am not allowed to return any of the bad shipments even though I was sent items I did not order. Apria expects payment and has turned my account over to collections.Apria Healthcare is a national group. I heard that they are one of six allowed by Medicare under Obamacare. Millions of patients will be treated badly thanks to our public officials being well paid, trading their responsibility to the American voters for lined pockets.
1	Customer service is dreadful. Don't expect return calls as they don't happen. One star is exceeding the quality of service received. This review is for the Scottsdale office
1	This review is for the Scottsdale office--15616 N 83rd Way Scottsdale, AZ 85260.  I wish I had checked Yelp before going here.  Wow, they are as bad as the reviews say.  Three errors with me and I won't be back.
