1	I decided to break from routine and get a haircut at a local Great Clips. I called ahead and asked if they had an experienced barber that could do a flat top. The lady assured me that they did. I was Leary to say the least when she sat me in a chair of a 20 something fibbertygibbet dressed like Madonna. Half way through this butchering, she asked my advice and then the advice of the owner on how to accomplish this haircut. Kid you not, it was an inch longer at the sides than the center. I looked like a cross between the Gunny and flock of seagulls. I went home, set the clippers on 3 and finished the job......Would not go back here unless I lost a bet.
2	everytime i come here for a haircut they mess it up. a good haircut is suppose to last 15 to 25 minutes this place has you in and out in 5 minutes. never coming back
4	Good for a quick, inexpensive haircut for myself or my son. They're always friendly, too.
1	My girlfriend went for an appointment here and the stylist didn't come in. We re-scheduled for the next day and when we walked in the manager said we would be the first customer for the stylist day. When we walked in (early), the stylist took someone else first. My girlfriend went to the manager and asked what happened and she would not answer. When we finally got to the chair for a cut the stylist took out the electric razor and went right for the scalp with a #2 blade!  My girlfriend yelled my name and when I went up to see what was wrong I couldn't believe what I saw. I feel the stylist did this on purpose. She should never cut hair again. My girlfriend did not want me to name her name in fear she would lose her job. If that were me, she would have. What the hell is going on at this place?!
