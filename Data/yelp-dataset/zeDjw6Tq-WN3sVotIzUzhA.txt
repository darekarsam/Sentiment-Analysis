5	In Montreal on business, this was recommended by friends who know I like burgers. WOW! They grind their own meat, which means you can have a medium rare burger, something I have only had in Europe. If you are in the area of one of their current 3 locations in Montreal, and you like the simple pleasure of a great burger- I would say this is somewhere you have to check out. Highly recommended.
5	Absolutely one of the best burgers I have ever had! The food is fresh and delicious . Tried the spicy fries, and enjoyed some chilli as well...the service was exceptional! I highly recommend Burger de Ville on Jarry street in Montreal !
