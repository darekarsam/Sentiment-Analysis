2	Have gone a few times over the years, mainly because its a convenient place to pop in while strolling in Little Italy, and I've always left feeling like something was missing...or off... from the dining experience. A lunch time pit stop with a girl friend left us staring at our bill in amazement (2 panninis and 2 lemonades rang in at over 50$ with tax and tip!) We both had the prosciutto-mozzarella-red pepper pannini which wasn't bad but certainly not worth the price. It was stingy on prosciutto and the mozzarella was a little rubbery. Its fine quality for a quick, cheap bite but at that price, I expect better. Service wasn't terrible and certainly courteous but not particularly attentive. Although our waitresswas suddenly much more attentive when our very attractive male friend stopped by our table!  Pet peeve - our waitress replied in French when we attempted to speak English. A quick dinner stop last Friday wasn't much different. We had the margherita pizza and sausage pizza and neither were showstoppers. The crust was very thin and well cooked(plus!) but both the cheese and sausage tasted very pre-packaged and neither pizza arrived particularly hot. Service was better - our waitress was bilingual and took time taking our orders and offering up clarifications (maybe because we were joined by abovementioned attractive male friend?) Although when I asked for San Pellegrino lemonade, I was brought a random brand of sparkling water...Restaurant itself is clean and spacious with comfortable seating and large screens which permitted us to watch hockey highlights.
3	If you're in Little Italy, it'a decent place to have lunch. The menu is not amazing, but the daily specials are usually very good. The focaccia is exceptionnal. I would not go for supper because of the limited menu and the ambiance. The service is good... sometimes a little slow, but polite and friendly.
