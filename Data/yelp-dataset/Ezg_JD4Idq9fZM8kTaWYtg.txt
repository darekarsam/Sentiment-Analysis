5	As new Harley owners, we have been looking for a good place to purchase leather goods, boots and accessories at reasonable prices.  We found that place today.  Leather Headquarters had an incredible selection along with amazing prices.  They even sell some Harley items, including boots and shirts.  The staff was very friendly, helpful and not at all pushy.  We are very much looking forward to returning soon.
1	I have been to this store a few times and the service is hit or miss.  I went in yesterday to get a couple patches sewn on my vest.  I was waiting and looking at some other patches they had for sale meanwhile some other guys came in for patches to be sewn on.  The sales lady knowingly let them be next and then told me sorry they were not taking anymore sewing orders for the day and that they were closed tomorrow.  This was shitty and terrible customer service considering she knew I was next and had  bought my vest from her at the store a few weeks ago.  I mean make an accommodation or tell me what you can do.  This lady (not the one who sews the patches) always seems dry and cranky.  The customer service I have received at the Boulder Hwy location has been much better.
1	I went here on a Thursday to get HOG patches seen on two vests.  I was told they don't do sewing on Thursdays or Fridays.  This was annoying because I live in the SW valley, and it was a pain to drive here.  There was also nothing about that on their website.  Okay, stuff happens.  I asked if I could leave the vests and pick them up next week.  They said no, because they would not be there when the seamstress came in.  What?  One of the women suggested I drive to Boulder Highway because they're sewing today.  I said that I'd already wasted enough time and I'd find somewhere else.
