3	It's an Einstein's and it's at school.  The food is OK.  The coffee is OK.  I basically come here because it's on campus and it's convenient.  I usually end up with a bagel thin sandwich and a signature coffee, and my bill ends up around $10.  The bagel sandwiches are hit or miss.  Sometimes they are well put-together and taste good.  Other times my sandwiches are sloppy and lack flavor.  The service could use some refinement.  But like I said, it's at school and it's convenient.
