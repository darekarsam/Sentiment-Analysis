5	I backed my Tacoma into some attack plants in Arizona.  The thorns scratched the paint job badly.  Kyle spent all day detailing the truck.  By the time he was finished it was near showroom perfect.  I'm hoping to take my truck in for a spa day every year.
5	Kyle is amazing! My bf needed his truck detailed in a very short period of time, and kyle was more than able flex his schedule and come out and help us out.He didnt even ask for a payment before he got to work! On top of that he went and took care of a few extra scratches that my boyfriend told him not to worry about, for no extra charge!If youre looking for an affordable, high quality auto detailer, then your search should stop here.
