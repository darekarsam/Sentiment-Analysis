5	Beautiful jewelry, custom designer line available, totally unique and amazing quality. A must see! Beautiul store with great nightlife around.
5	For my 50th birthday, my husband upgraded my engagement setting, and I of course wanted my diamond mounted in it right away, and while I wait.  Abraham did the work right in front of me, and was so speedy and efficient, that he had it finished in under 15 minutes.  He also did a full appraisal while I waited.  The prices were very reasonable too.  I will definitely make the drive from Cornelius to Pineville to work with him exclusively in the future.  Do not be fooled by the mall location.  He stocks super high end items right there in the store, and is an expert craftsman, and nothing at all like a standard mall jeweler.  I am extremely pleased.
