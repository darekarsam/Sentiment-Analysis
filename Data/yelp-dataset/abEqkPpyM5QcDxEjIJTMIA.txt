1	Horrible! They serve burned and inappropriate food that should be thrown out.  I ordered an Egg McMuffin and Chicken Biscuit at their drive thru.  I pulled away trying to get to the hospital to see my boyfriend before surgery and realized half of my English Muffin was black and burned and the Chicken was over cooked, very dark and dry.  If I had only had time I would have gone back but this instance I did not.  I was so displeased with them that I thought it was worthy to YELP about!I will not be choosing this McDonalds again!!!
2	It's true, they do have incredibly slow service. But my order has never been messed up, and they are usually pretty friendly. Don't stop by if you're running late for work.
1	It is a weirdly configured McDonalds, no question about it; but I don't believe that is really a factor here.  Just be mindful that if you are going in, the doors are located on the sides and if you take drive-thru you have to circle the building at least once then exit by taking at least one u-trun back onto South Boulevard.The location is relatively clean in the dining area and drink station; I don't know about the kid area though.  The speed of service is somewhat slower than the average McDonalds (both front and drive-thru); the front associate automatically will assume people are on-the-go, so typically no trays.  However, what makes this a one-star is the food quality.  Typically anything fried at this location is going to be both burnt and greasy (this includes hash browns, fries, apple pies, McNuggets, etc.).  The burgers are also surprisingly greasy as well.  And the levels of salt are surprising as well.  Probably the only bright spot is that the McCafe drinks were on par.Overall, this is not a McDonalds location to go to, just go down the next exit.
1	The order was taken correctly but the person at last window gave me the wrong item. No time to back for them to fix a mistake...
