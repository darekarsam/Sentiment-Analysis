1	Scandalous. Located in a horrible part of town. Absolutely disgusting rooms. I had to duct tape the curtains to the wall for privacy. The mattress was like a board. The bathtub faucet fell into the tub when I turned the water on. They gouged us $60 even though the sign out front said $40, but we were desperate. I sincerely hope this place burns to the ground.
1	Negative stars. Every inch of this property is filthy, shady, and in poor repair. Broken glass, broken door frames, filthy broken curtains, uneven floors. All this I could let slide, but I used my debit card to pay for the room against my better judgement, and lo and behold two days later I have to cancel my card due to fraud. My card was used to make a small test purchase at a motel in Missouri, and luckily my bank has a great fraud detection department and it didn't progress beyond that. I'm embarrassed to admit that I even stayed here, but I would like to help others avoid making the same mistake.
3	Yes it looks a bit sketchy on the outside but inside not that bad at all booked it for a night after staying the on strip for a couple of days. 45 is a great price just pay cash and your good to go. I would definetly stay there again.
1	Negative stars! I checked in and because a friend was with me to unload my luggage they charged me extra and demanded their ID. The first room they gave me was filthy and the doors nor windows locked with plywood floors. The second room had filthy carpets, broken down furniture, roaches, windows without locks, wet sheets covered by urine scented comforter, molded shower curtain, filthy towels and no hot water. I let the water run for 5 minutes to wash my hands and no hot water. I was told that there weren't refunds. I wouldn't recommend this establishment to anyone.
1	You are better off staying in a roach motel. Older than the hills and twice as dirty. It is possible that this broken down shit hole is zombie headquarters.
