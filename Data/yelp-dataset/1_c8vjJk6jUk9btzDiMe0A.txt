4	Such a sweet little spot! Tiny little casual bistro in the neighborhood, seats about 20 total during the winter, more when the patio is open. The breaded calamari was delicious, the texture just right, and so tasty I nearly filled up on calamari alone. The breaded fish and shrimp were also yum, lovely little wine list and utterly charming hosts - Definitely a local spot worth supporting!!
5	On our way back home from running errands, my husband and I noticed this small bistro and we stopped by to grab a bite. We had no expectations. We found out that Bistro Entre Ciel et Terre has a simple yet varied menu which includes for most (if not all) items the appetizer, main course as well as dessert, all of which were delicious! Being a couple of vegetarians, we had the veggie burger which tasted great! The service was also very courteous and speedy. We left with a smile on our face, pleased by the experience, and glad to have found yet another spot in Montreal's sud-ouest that serves good food.
