5	i am a 19 year old girl who got stranded with a horribly shredded tire, and a hole in my spare. i was very hesitant to call anyone because i am young female who was alone at night with no one else to call. but the man that came to help me was nice, friendly and made me feel safe. i only waited about 20 minutes, which was their previously stated wait time. it was a little pricey at $89 but the service was well worth it. good experience over all.. highly recommended!
5	I've never had great experiences with towing companies but this was actually a great experience. It took over an hour to sort out the details of getting my car taken care of but Gary, the owner, was really patient and helpful. I hope I don't have to call a towing company the next time I'm out in Vegas, but if I do I'm calling these guys.
1	I had a flat on my truck at 2:30 am. I was on highway 15 and my GPS said it was 34 miles to my house. I spoke with Century towing and they told me it would be $175 and would take 45 minutes to an hour for the truck to get here. I told them that was acceptable. Around 20 minutes later the driver called me and said they had decided to charge me $275 and they needed a credit card number over the phone. I told him I would call the front desk again to ask the manager why the price went up $100. I tried calling several times and they would not answer. I feel that they were attempting to extort the extra $100 and should have honored their original quote to me. I gave them my exact location and how many miles it was to where I needed to go. He calculated $175. To call me back and demand an extra $100 is just wrong!  I highly recommend that anyone working with them be extremely cautious
