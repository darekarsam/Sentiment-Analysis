5	Professional, timely, friendly service.  My battery died as I was heading home to Maricopa.  I called White's Towing and they were there in a flash.  They took great care of my vehicle as they loaded it up.  The staff was friendly and caring, offered me a bottle of cold water with the blazing outdoor heat that I broke down in.  They helped to get me home in a flash, unloaded my vehicle and helped me turn what could have been a really bad day into solutions.  Thank you White's Towing!! We will always call you in the future!!
1	The owner lied about the cost. my car broke down at night and I couldn't wait for another tow company. very dishonet greedy man who tells you one price on the phone then changes it to a flat fee to mess you over.  If you need a tow and don't want to get messed over call tow for less.
