5	It started out a little shaky, they only had a pick up truck at first, went to another location for a car that had a flat tire and then I got a Toyota Camry, which was great, especially when I ordered a subcompact.For waiting around, I got 10% off and a few extra hours to bring the car back.  The representative was very nice.  I would rent here again.  And I got to bring the car back on the strip for no extra pick off fee and I avoided the lines at the airport and the high airport fees too.
3	Reservations went well. Check in was smooth. At first glance the car looked great until we left the building and looked at the back seat.  There was rubbish on the chair and water bottles in the doorway.  Ugh! They obviously did not clean the car from their last customer!! Look before leaving the lot!!
1	I should give 0 star to this location!!! Kidding me? Calling for half an hour while driving around, and then being told to park my car first, and walk in to rent the car?!  On the phone with a guy all the way looking for a tiny little cardboard written the name in the end.. What the hell!!! No sign outside, no instructions, WTF!!Stay away from this, if you don't want to waste your time, and ruin your vacation!!
