2	Misdiagnosed an engine issue.  Didn't refund money...continued to look for the issue and kept the cash.  Came up with an estimate of TWICE price of what was actually needed to fix my problem.Offers hard cookies and coffee while you wait.  If you need work done on your Chevy, I'd recommend Ballweg in Middleton.  Better stuff to eat while you wait, internet and computer stations to play on and coffee, soda, water, hot chocolate.
5	I love working with Zimbrick!  Love my new Equinox!  Awesome team over at Sun Prairie...everyone was incredibly helpful!  Thanks so much!
1	Limited selection and condescending, immature salesperson.
5	I purchased a 2014 Chevy Cruze. The salesman Brian Cern was very friendly and knowledgable. I knew which car I was looking for and was pre-approved for the loan so I did not need help in this area. The Finance Manager explained all of my options in detail and gave me time to make decisions. They both were very professional and courteous. I had a great experience with Zimbrick Chevrolet and will purchase another car from them in the furture.
5	Had here oil change today.  Quick and convenient. Free WiFi and coffee ( mocha, expresso, hot chocolate). Nice waiting room with TV. Durand Larsen take care of customers with professionalism.
