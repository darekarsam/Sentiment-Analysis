3	They were fast and friendly.  I placed an order then immediately called back to add an additional topping.  I asked how much extra it would be and she said "Free - Merry Christmas! "  Maybe I chose the wrong type of crust (herb) but it was salty and the cheese bread didn't have real melted cheese but sprinkled cheese.  It was not good and very oily.  Maybe next time I will order differently and hope for the best.  Not bad but not the best.
1	I decided to try Hungry Howie's on a whim.  Eek! Me thinks never again!  The pizza was very bland and not something I would recommend to any of my friends.  I would say some of their sandwiches looked pretty good but I haven't tried them.
4	Talk about lucky!!  Tried to order from another local pizza joint, but it was closed so on a whim I called this place.  The really cool thing is that they actually offer a variety of crust flavors, like jalapeno, or garlic......went for just plain this time.  The peperoni was a tad on the greasy side, but hey....it's meat!  Also ordered a Hawaiian and it was superb!!Great pizza, quick service, will def go back!
1	Thumbs down. This pizza is expensive if you add just a few more toppings. I gave it 1 star because of its thin crust which is my preference.
4	We ate here our first night in Charlotte! It was delivered quickly, still hot, and fresh!! I got the Everything Bagel crust, not impressed, very very salty! I did like the Cajun bread sticks! Excited to try different crust types!!
2	I dont know if it's because I'm from philly and things are made different or what but I dont like the pizza. My husband loves it because the sauce is sweet. I've given them chances and even tried the calazone. In philly they are made with cheeses, sauce on the side, with anything in the inside.  Here they make it like a sandwich with butter melted. Just messy to me. Its hard to find a good pizza.
