2	Do not... I repeat do not.. go here. Owner/manager is condescending unless you are a celebrity's wife
5	I was in search of a dress for an upcoming event and came across Roxanne's. I sent an email asking for styles and colors that I was eyeing and Lola emailed me back right away. Although they didn't have the Sherri Hill dress that I wanted in stock, she did say she had some other options in my size. I work long hours and my schedule is constantly changing but they were VERY accommodating even telling me I could come in after hours to try on a dress. I ended up going in on a Saturday afternoon and they had a beautiful red dress for me to try on. Although I didn't end up purchasing a dress through Roxannes, their customer service was great, they were very accommodating and willing to help. I'd make sure to look to them for any future dress needs I have and would recommend them based off my experience!
