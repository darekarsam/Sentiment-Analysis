1	Devin Luzod is a scammer !!!! Never adjusted just sales pitched and shown videos .. Waste of time  and $
1	I can't even give it a star. 180.00 no adjustment, just videos, and a sales pitch. I'm canceling my payment for fraud via credit card. F this scamming bastage. I have ZERO good things to say about the 4000.00 plan that they wanted me to finance through GE capital. Do NOT go to this place. Unless you want to just throw away money.
