1	Check the police reports.  Many break-ins here.  Lack of security camera, they keep the gates open at night, and they claim to have a security guard at night, but he is only there once a week.  BEWARE!
4	Monica was super kind and helpful! I highly recommend renting a storage unit at this location. The staff is great!
4	I had a great experience even though it was very short term. I stored my stuff in a unit for one month. The staff was super helpful in making sure I was selecting the proper unit and that I had everything I needed. The locks you CN purchase from them are expensive but very sturdy. I liked they they allow entry (by code only) until 9 pm. Monica was very helpful and I would suggest this spot
5	Monica was the face of this particular location and she totally rocks! Here's why:(1) She knows her stuff. She knows the concerns that a potential tenant would have and addresses those issues, clearly and succinctly without marketing "hype" or lingo.(2) She is super personable and helpful as are the rest of the staff. Cheerfulness begets cheerfulness.(3) She is straightforward and to the point.All in all  our experience there was superlative and I would definitely recommend this location to anybody that is looking store their precious belongings.
