1	We tried this place when it first opened, and after you take your pizza home and bake it you then throw it out.  Take and bake and toss pizza.  Strictly for the kids, but a frozen pizza from the store is much better pizza so it is hard to understand how this place stays in business.
5	Fast, Friendly-- This place is on the money!
5	Great pizza for a reasonable price. Very creative to offer take & bake and makes dinners much more efficient.
5	Great pizza for a great price.   They have a wide menu, and everything is made to order right in front of you with fresh ingredients.   People are nice and friendly.   Unlike many pizza places,  everyone looks nice   Not all the tats and piercing.
