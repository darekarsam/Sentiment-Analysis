5	My tips lasted 4 weeks with very minmal lifting! And they did an awesome job. Also, their pedicures are amazing! The ladies are all wonderful and very courteous. A joy to spend an afternoon getting pampered.
4	Nice place! I had a horrible experience at another nail salon so I wanted to try this one out and I had a much better time here.  I only got the gel nail polish with a French nail style but seriously considering coming back again in a couple of weeks and maybe getting a pedicure too! :)
4	Wonderful massage chairs that have the full head neck back shiatsu style massagers in them. Three levels of pedicures ranging in prices from 25-45..I picked the mid level one that included callus removal, sugar scrub, extended massage, hot stone and towels. .walked out after an hour plus spoiling feeling great. I will be back
5	I was so happy that my bestie found this place! On Yelp no less!  The customer service was on point, and my nails look amazing!  I recently moved to Arizona from California, and I am so happy that I've found a nail salon for me!!  I highly recommend this place, you won't be disappointed!!
1	Second visit. First was for a pedicure lady cut two of my toes so that the rest of the pedicure burned. At one point I asked the woman, "are you new", if I wasn't there with a new friend I would have walked out. Fast  forward to me being an idiot 2 weeks later when I needed a no chip manicure redo I did it on Friday today is Monday and every single  freaking nail is chipped and peeling. I have great anxiety about going back tomorrow to complain. I am afraid. I don't expect a fix or receptive attitude. I will let you know either good or bad...
5	Best pedi I've ever had. I get the second one up for $30. They spend a good amount of time massaging.
