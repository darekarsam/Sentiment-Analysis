3	Tiny, crammed little Canadian Tire full of crazy! I've never tried to return anything so I can't speak to that, but if you want to feel dizzy and grab something quick with your Canadian Tire bucks, this is your local joint.
1	Worst Canadian Tire in Canada. They will NOT accept any return that wasn't bought in that store. What a concept. They have nothing. They have little inventory, and what they do have is crammed in tight with alleys 2 feet wide. Why bother. Drive to the 40 or Sherbrooke. You won't regret the drive.
