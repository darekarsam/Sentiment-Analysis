4	Located on St. Paul Street in Old Montreal Taj Mahal offers Authentic Indian Food. Frankly I don't expect a lot from places located in touristy areas. But Taj Mahal proved me wrong. The restaurant pretty much has no decor. Just tables and chairs crammed into a room. Service is not too fast. My rating for em till this point was 2.5 stars. Then the server brought the complimentary poppadoms with the sauces. They were really crisp & tasty. We ordered the Chicken Vindaloo & Lamb Madras with Garlic Naan & Basmati rice. Both the vindaloo & Madras had a zing to it. The chicken was perfectly cooked, so was the lamb. The nan's were freshly baked and the rice was fluffy & aromatic. One of the best Indian places I've been to in Montreal. The ratings jump to 4 stars. The service might seem slow, but I guess cooking something well does take time. I'd say while you wait for your entree's, sip on to Indian beer (Though I'm not a big fan) or some White wine (Goes really well with spicy food). The place is a bit pricey, but its Old Montreal, Touristy area.... blah blah. But yeah definitely worth a visit Food -  Really GoodService - OkAmbiance -Pls message me if you find an Indian restaurant with good ambiance. Worth the money - Oui
5	The menu here is great and service is fantastic. We live close by and have come here a couple times; its nice and quiet so great if you like  a bit of intimacy. Also its one of the few places in Old Montreal where the bill ends up being less than you expected.
3	Good service. Naan was so-so. Chicken tikka masala was great. They really make it hot when asked for extra spice, without destroying the flavor.
