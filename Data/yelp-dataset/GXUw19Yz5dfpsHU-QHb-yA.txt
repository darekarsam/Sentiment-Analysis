5	Came in to check out the new rides for 2015. This place is amazing and huge! Courtesy greeter in the parking lot came up to me and shook my hand. Guided me IGT where I needed to go. Really nice experience. I'm on the list for the new F150. I can't wait!!
5	Great experience here as compared to the other local Ford dealers!  No hard sell, honest did not try any " bait and switch"  they worked very hard to be able to meet my price.  Work with salesman Tibor he's very knowledgeable and conscience.  Would highly recommend them.  I am very happy with my new C Max.
4	First experience here was a ZERO star due to miscommunication. That all changed when Justin took the lead on helping me. I'd give him 6 stars if I could! Best price in town. Went out of way to help me. Ask for Justin - worth the drive from anywhere in town if you are looking for a Ford and a great car-buying experience.
1	Will never do business with Surprise ford. Found a F150 on car gurus for $37,956. Sent multiple emails about the truck and decided to go test drive it. I decided to go talk price and when they came out the price had gone from the 37,956 to 44,000. They didnt know how the truck was listed for 37,956. I got up and left. I dont have time to play games.
1	I wrote a review, but it ended up under Nissan for some reason. Horrible experience here. Would not deal with us. Sales man even took his business card back. Bought my mustang at Peoria Ford the next day.I won't even go here for service now. I realize that it probably has the same owner as here, but I will deal with Peoria Ford.
