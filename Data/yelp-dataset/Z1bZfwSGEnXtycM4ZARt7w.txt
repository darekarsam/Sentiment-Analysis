4	I know this place is listed as a shoe store, but they really have a lot more to offer than just that.  It has all you could ever need to fulfill your alternative/rock star image.  They have concert tees and more accessories than you can shake a stick at (whatever that means).  And of course the shoes, the kind that are comfortable and still look cool.  Not many people know this, but they do piercings too.  Like the kind you can't go to the mall to get.  I've never actually gotten pierced here but I've heard they do a very good job.
3	Ok I would give this place four stars, but on the outside of the store it states that there is a clearance sale and everything inside is 90 percent off and it is not.  I think that this place overcharges for piercings, if you want a piercing just go down the block to Ink Link, twenty dollars for everything all day long.  The good thing about this place is that they carry Serial Killer shirts and I love 'em.  They feature movies like Taxi Driver and Pulp Fiction.  Even though they have false advertisement outside the store, the clerks are still pretty pleasant.
4	I'm not sure what's up with the 90% off banner...not a lot of the stuff is 90% off...but there are still some good sales going on right now. They've got some interesting things in the shoe and clothing departments, and it's fun to be able to find all the funky finds in one spot. A lot of times I forget that the Rock & Roll Emporium is here, and I'll start surfing the net to find just the right t-shirt, just the right funky shoes, or just the right gift for a uber-cool friend. Anything I might find online, I could find here. They have a good selection of piercing jewelry as well.This is a fun little shopping center, with the Red Door and Adam and Eve right around the corner. It's a great place to go with girlfriends!
