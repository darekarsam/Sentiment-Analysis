5	One word.  AMAZING!Another word.  GO!A final few words.  Ask what the house special is that day and try it...it's always a nice surprise to me and I discover food I've never heard of.
4	Not only the owner Suzanne is a great friend of mine, but this charming restaurant offers friendly services and good food.I love going there and feeling just right;)Give it a try and you won't be disappointed.X
3	Seems to be a mixture if various Asian dishes. The food was tasty but not out of this world heavenly! Service was ok. Overall, not wow-d by the experience unfortunately.
3	Amazing food, great prices. As a whole it's a great restaurant but TERRIBLE service. The man who was serving was not only slow but unpleasant. Spoke to the table next to us for a good 15 minutes. We sat with dirty plates in front of us waiting for the bill for about 25 minutes. He said very little to us, for example after waiting 20 minutes for drink orders to be taken, he just stood at our table waiting for us to say what we want. Not even a hello. It's such a shame because its a cute place with great food.
5	I have been eating at Soy for over 5 years now.  The food is soooooo good(except for the tofu which is a little mushy for my taste) but every other item is awesome.  The peppercorn shrimp and general tao chicken and shrimp are completely addicting.  Crispy, flavourful,and the presentation is nice. You get a yummy appetizer, then your meal, then tea and cookies.  I usually go at lunch because the price is really reasonable for the portions and quality.  At lunch, MAKE A RESERVATION or you won't get in because the Ubisoft crowd fills the place up between noon at 1pm.  The atmosphere is fun, the service is great and friendly.  Definitely a Mile End goto place..:)
