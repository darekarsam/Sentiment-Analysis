2	Kathy usually does her best to take  great care of me and my nails. The other two techs I have spoken with when being helped by Kathy also seem very nice. Can get busy. I have had one or two unfortunate mishaps here from other techs filing too much and making my cuticles hurt. Overall though I can't complain. It's usually very quick in here once you are seated. I've since moved on to greener pastures where my nails don't hurt!
1	Don't come here!! Stay away!!! Not clean , reuse the pedicure water on other people. Tell you it's an hour wait , when really it's more like two hours!!! They are rude & prices change all the time!! They include their tip on the price as well .  They remove to much skin on the callus remover pedi . Seen this happen on two people while I was waiting . These people couldn't even walk properly . STAY AWAY!!
5	I went in August 4th, Kathy did my feet, Awesome! And Tammy did my gel nail polish, Awsome! Im going back today
3	I came in on a Tuesday afternoon and it was easy to get a spot for a pedicure. Got a great foot/leg message with the pedi and walked out with a simple polish for $18 not including tip. I had read the reviews here and didn't see any of the issues that some other folks had put up. It looked clean to me - and people who worked there were friendly.
4	I'm surprised at the negative reviews. Kathy's is the best spot on this side of town...I have seen and heard horror stories at other places. Kathy's has always been great for me. My pedicure is still holding up 3 weeks later! Never a long wait time except Saturdays (duh). The only complaint is that they need to clearly display prices. That's not fair especially with the somewhat language barrier.
