1	Too bad I can't give this place zero stars. The only people that actually say good things about this place are just family members of the owners and friends of the owners. The absolute worst service me and my girlfriend have EVER received at a beauty salon. First they are completely rude to us while they're working on my girlfriend's hair and then they over charge us money when it clearly says that hair cuts are $5 and get completely defensive when we call them out on it. The owners themselves were came out and were completely rude to us. THE WORST PLACE EVER, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO TO ANY BEAUTY SALON THAT IS NOT THIS ONE.
5	Best salon ever. Truly kind and know their stuff.My hair color is gorgeous!!!Awesome prices!And the MEN and BOYS haircuts are $5!Love this placeIf you want a good haircut go there!
5	I have my hair killed by some other salon. I came to this one and they fixed me up amazing. They have me a hair treatment and fixed the mess the other salon made.
