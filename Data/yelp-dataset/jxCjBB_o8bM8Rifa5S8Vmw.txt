4	This place has been opened for less than a year so everything is new and the equipment is top notch.  This was the first place I been to that has something newer to replace that machine that blows air in your eye.  The Dr. was very nice and so was the guy in the lobby who does the sales and insurance stuff.I would give 5 stars but they did not fully understand my benefits and almost shorted me $175 worth of coverage.   Thankfully the staff was able to call and figure it out. Also other places I have been have more selection on shades but this was not a deal breaker.
5	This was the best eye exam and prescription I've had in years...Everything is so crisp and clear with my new lenses..If you want the best vision possible I strongly recommend using this practice for all your eye care needs.
5	Love this office! You will love the interior decorating, it's modern, stylish, and chic all at the same time. This office has only been open for about a year. Dr. Karen Simon is so personable and she is top notch on prescriptions! I have been to many offices and she is hands down the best! Jared takes care of the office and is a licensed optician dispenser. He is very professional and I had no problems making an appointment. Both staff members understand a lot about VSP and EyeMed insurance since they are covered in those networks. Dr. Simon informed me that my prescription was so strong that I qualify for 6 times the allowance from my insurance because my glasses/contacts are medically necessary. She was able to get me a year supply of  daily disposable contacts for astigmatism for nothing out of pocket! Typically my insurance allowance is $100. Save yourself the hassle, see Dr. Simon. My previous optometrist wasted 3 trips and after the third I asked for a refund but was given a mediocre prescription instead. I wish I has known about this office sooner.
