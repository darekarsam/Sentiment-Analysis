5	This carwash is the Best I have run across. I am a finatic when it comes to having a clean car. I go to the car wash not once or twice a week but once or twice a day. The owner is very personable and helpful. He takes the time to get to know the people who stop in. I would probably own stock in floor mats if he had not noticed the many many times I forgot my mats and put them aside for me. Everything is always working and works well. I want to say thanks for the wonderful business you have.

5	This a great car wash! Very clean, gives you a great wash, love that it accepts plastic, nicely lit up. Nothing but great things to say about it. Just wish there was one closer to my home.
