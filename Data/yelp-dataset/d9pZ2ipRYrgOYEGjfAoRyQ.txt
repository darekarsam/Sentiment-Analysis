4	Once voted as Montreal's best pizza, Coronet still is one of the top 5 in the city. The sauce has a certain sweetness to it. I love that they still do it the old fashioned way - one pizza at a time (not sure if they toss them in the air...hmmm). The edges are all fat and uneven and they put rolled dough in the center when they deliver.
4	So we were in from Toronto and ordered a pizza from here, and loved it. It is a delightful "mom & pop" kind of place, where the food tastes real, and the people who work there are friendly. We picked up, and the food was great.  Reasonable prices, fast.  All around, i'm a fan.

4	Many years before moving to the borough of St. Laurent I was aware this place was voted the best pizza in Montreal by both CFCF TV & CJAD radio, so when I had the chance to try I was not disappointed. Not sure when if opened, but the fridge they keep their ingredients looks like a well-working relic of the industrial age, as time has stood still, not in a negative, but a very old-style welcoming. I have two other restaurants for pizza within close proximity to this, each has their own merits that keep me returning.
