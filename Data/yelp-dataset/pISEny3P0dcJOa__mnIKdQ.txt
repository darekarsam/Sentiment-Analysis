4	this is the starbucks of tea!it is not the best tea shop in town by far but it's a good introduction to the tea world that is a lot less intimidating than your run of the mill tea shops.with many choices, you are bound to find one, or many, to your liking. nothing fancy. service is courteous and extremely helpful. price is decent for a cup. they always have a flavor of the week that is worth trying.it is what it is, a nice alternative from coffee and those tea at coffee shops
