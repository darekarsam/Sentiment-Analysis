5	I had a great shopping experience at this store.   They were very busy but we'll staffed for last minute holiday shoppers and had a great selection to choose from.   The sales associate that assisted me was very knowledgeable and helped me find something I was very happy with and checked out in under 15 minutes.   I will definitely return to this site to shop in the future.
4	First visit at this location and won't be my last. I stopped in to select a Birthday gift and the sales ladies were very friendly and helpful. Ended up buying something for myself as well.
4	I can never pass a Brighton store without stopping in.  If you don't know Brighton they have very distinctive look and a lot of interesting silver jewelry, handbags and depending on the store belts, hair clips, business card holders, etc.  Their look is so distinctive you can buy something and come back in 10 years and if it broke, they will fix it (like the readers I accidentally squashed).   Every store carries different stock.  Summerlin is more conservative but in the Palazzo (or was it Veneitian?) they had cooler, more blingy purses.Overall fun to browse and even funner to buy and wear!
