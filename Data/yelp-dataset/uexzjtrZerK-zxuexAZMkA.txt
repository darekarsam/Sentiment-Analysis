5	Christine is awesome! She has been doing my hair since I moved here AND she is fabulous with my kiddos. They love to get their hair cut because of her. I always get loads of compliments on my hair and she is the only one that dyes my hair in a way that it does not wash out in a few shampoos. She really listens to what you want is always a pleasure to deal with.
5	Christine is so talented and excellent at what she does!  Truly a fantastic hair artist!  If you haven't gone to her already, make an appointment today!  You WON'T be sorry!!  Thanks Christine!
5	I went to Christine from Just for You Salon based on the reviews she received from other Yelp reviewers. I have to say she was everything good every reviewer said and more. She consulted me on my hair, listen to me and then used organic products to help my hair look silky and soft. She cut just the right amount and she gave me advice based on my needs not hers. Usually people say come to cut your hair every month, but since I told her I am trying to grow it, she was very genuine and said that 3 months should be time for me to cut it again.  I like her and I will go back. Oh, and she cut me a deal that is HARD to beat. I strongly recommend her.
