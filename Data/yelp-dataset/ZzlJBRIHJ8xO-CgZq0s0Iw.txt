3	Located at the entrance of the quite busy St James Shopping Centre, this store always appears to be overflowing with stock. In fact the clothes are so tightly packed it gets difficult to have a proper look through stuff. It's great to have a browse through, and  I realise style is a matter of taste, but after a while all the clothes start to look sort of the same and the big name brands printed far too obviously across many of the clothes can be a bit annoying. However, as Eleanor M. said it's a great place for finding a piece for an outfit and an alternative to Topshop or H&M.

Upon arrival I was blinded by an unbearably fluorescent line of clothing of which seemed to be at a half way house between naff beach gear and utterly chavvy yob-tops, as I like to call them.An incomprehensible mishmash of high street styles results in a shop I tend to simply avoid.
