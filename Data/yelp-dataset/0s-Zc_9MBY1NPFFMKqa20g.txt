5	An incredibly detailed company!  Came on time, were diligent in their work and very easy to work with.  Their rates are very competitive and they even followed up.  I'm signed up for automatic periodic cleanings.  They even did my solar panels!!! Awesome!
5	Couldn't be more impressed with the work done by Cloud 9.  They gave us a very competitive bid, and did an incredible job on our windows.  So glad we found these guys!
5	Great Company to work with. Found the website a little confusing, but all worked out. Very happy with results and customer service.
5	Awesome job.  Very fast response time via email.  Inquired on a Sunday night they were at my doorstep on Tuesday morning.  Very friendly / fast service.  I would recommend to anyone.
5	We had an excellent experience with Sam and Cloud 9. They over-delivered on all counts, especially customer service. Their technicians were polite, skilled and fast. The job was competitively priced and we are very pleased with the work -- windows spotless! Our screens were so dirty we thought they were brown and barely let light through -- now they are black again! Very pleased with the results. We would recommend them highly and would use their services again.
