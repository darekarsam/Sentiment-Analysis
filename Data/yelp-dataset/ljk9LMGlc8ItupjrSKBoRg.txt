3	Convenient to Carowinds theme park, and excellent hot breakfast.We stayed here for a cheap hotel for the whole family & were very happy with the experience. The free breakfast was delicious (biscuits & gravy, sausage, bacon, eggs, waffles, yogurt, milk, juice, cereal, pastries, muffins, bagels, oatmeal). The pool was nice too, and they have extra towels by the pool so you don'th ave to use the room towels.Not a super fancy hotel, but it was a good value and convenient location, lots of restaurants nearby.
2	Very dated, small bathroom, tube TVBreakfast was good.
3	For what you pay here, this hotel is just fine. Sure there's some things that aren't as nice as you might find in other hotels, but this is a Comfort Suites, not a Hilton. The lobby area is set up nicely with a living room ambiance and the breakfast area behind it. I had a king room on the fifth floor which was better than I was expecting. Everything was clean, the furniture was in good repair, and there was a little kitchenette with a small sink, microwave, and fridge. I think the only issue I had with my room was the phone. The cable on the handset seemed to be worn out and there was some static when making a call.The biggest issue I had was with two different front desk staff. The first was a gentleman that gave me completely wrong directions on how to get to the light rail station by bus. Had I taken his directions blindly I would have ended up somewhere in South Carolina. The second issue was when I asked for a late check-out. The staff member said that I could have an extra hour and check-out at noon instead of 11. Just after 11 on the day of check-out, housekeeping came knocking at the door. They weren't told that I had asked for a late check-out and she asked if she could come back at 2:00. It sounded like 2:00 was a normal time for a late check-out. So is it up to the staff at the front desk to pull a time out of the air or does the hotel actually have a late check-out policy?
