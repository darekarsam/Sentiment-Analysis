5	I love the Coffee Press. It's located inside of The Last Word bookstore, in the corner of the plaza located at W.T. Harris and N. Tryon, next to IHOP.If you are in the University area and want a good, locally owned, independent coffee shop, The Coffee Press is what you're looking for. In fact, I would recommend coming up to this area even if you aren't in the University area, because they are just that good. They are friendly, if a little slow in their service, but their coffee drinks are STRRRRONG. Delicious iced mochas, delicious vanilla and caramel lattes. Everything I have had there so far I have liked. Will definitely miss this place when I move. Better get my fill in now :)
5	I never thought about writing a review for this place since its inside of another place, but might as well.  100% agree with Jane Q.P.  Delicious coffee for a reasonable price at great location.
4	Popped into the bookstore for a bit to make some time pass while my wife was nearby in an appointment. Surprise, there's a small coffee shop here in a space that could well be a closet.But the coffee was better than the stuff they sling at *$ and it wasn't any more expensive.
