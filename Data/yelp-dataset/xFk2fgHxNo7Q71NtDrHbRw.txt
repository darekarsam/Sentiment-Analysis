3	Great place to stop in and pick up a pair of gloves if you didn't bring any.  Didn't have a great selection of snowpants or coats, though obviously march isn't when locals would be buying them.  Decent selection of warm stuff otherwise, as well as guidebooks in English and French, climbing and camping equipment, etc.  Standard sporting goods store... like an REI or EMS equivalent.
4	stuck in Montreal with woefully inadequate boots? This is the place for you!  Ok, it's *a* place for you. The other REI-like option would be Mountain Equipment Coop, http://www.mec.ca, but that's harder to get to if you don't have a car. La cordee is well located just off the gay village, near the metro and has a really decent selection. We got great service too, our very friendly boot salesguy heard we were new to town and was giving us tips on everything from metro passes to banking. But most of all La Cordee will have a soft spot in our hearts for supplying my friend with well-priced, comfortable, montreal-weather-worthy boots. And we all know the value of comfy toesies.
5	3 floors of sporting goods,sportswear,in one of the oldest outdoor/sporting goods/clothing stores in the city. All your sportswear or gear under one roof.
