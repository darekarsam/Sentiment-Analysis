3	This McDonald's is conveniently nearby the Pepsi Center.It opens late, and was perfect for the post-clubbing crowd I was with.A friend bought me a McChicken sandwich (not sure why, but I appreciated it), which I made short work of - it tasted normal, as expected.
3	Just like most Mcdonalds, opened 24/7 and free wi-fi. Nothing particularly special about this one. Recently renovated. It is quite dirty late at night though. Most of the tables are really messy so you end up spending 5 minutes trying to decide which one is the least messy to sit and eat.
4	This place is very busy and fast pace. It's located inside the mall and across the street from the metro. The place is pretty big inside and clean and the staff are polite and patience with there customers. I did not like how the tables are too close to each other which causes people to bump into each other while there eating.
