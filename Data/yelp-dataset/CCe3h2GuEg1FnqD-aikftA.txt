3	I will always be hard-pressed to understand why Pizza Hut in Canada is twice the price of its US counterpart. Even more questionable - this location doesn't deliver to Cote St. Luc even though it's on the cusp of the neighborhood - go figure! No amount of begging, pleading and willingness to compensate will urge the manager or staff to trek the extra mile.... REALLY?!Food's decent, the wait can be long, the service can suck, it's a toss up.I've had a really lousy server experience here once, it was extremely disappointing - waitress pretty much told me and my friend (both of us girls) that two pizzas would be too much food for us - RUDE and made a comment about how we almost came close to finishing them both off - EVEN MORE RUDE... then took 30 minutes to bring the bill. I spoke with the manager who neither apologized nor made any effort to resolve the issue. Charming.Anyhow, I stick to take out and avoid dining in because of this experience... the take out line is slow and like I mentioned previously - they don't deliver to my hood. Thankfully, I moved to the US and get Pizza Hut for half the price WITH delivery. SCORE!
