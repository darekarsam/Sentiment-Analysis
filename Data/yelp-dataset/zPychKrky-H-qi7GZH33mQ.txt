1	grungy, gross, depressing atmosphere at this office.  dr licata was very short, impersonal, and unnecessarily rude during the entire consult.  i will never ever consider a return visit to this office.
1	This place was awful! Bad service from the receptionist and doctors were quick and impersonable. I've been here twice with incorrect diagnosis leading me to see another physician. Bottom line avoid this place.
1	Worst Dr. I have EVER been to!  He is very degrading and said horrible things to me.  He acted like I didn't know anything and tried to pin my sweet husband against me. He is a creep!  Stay away from this office!  It is nasty, old, dirty, and the Dr. and staff is just terrible!  I walked out of my appointment because I didn't deserve such horrific things said about me. DO NOT GO!!!!!!!
1	I don't think this doctor even deserves a rating as high as 1. He is a typical pill pusher. I went to him for severe back pain which I have been seeing a chiropractor for for some time. He did not listen to my complaints but just prescribed pain meds which is what I have been trying to avoid. And he has the mist horrible bedside nanner. Worse experience ever!
