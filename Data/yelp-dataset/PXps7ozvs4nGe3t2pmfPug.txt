5	Had a crack in my windshield and I called Bryan Ray.  He got me all set up.  They rolled out the next day, showed up when they said they would, changed the windshield, charged my insurance and did a great job.  Good job done by Guardian.
5	Just bought a  car, transferred insurance from the old car but it didn't have windhshield coverage.  Got a rock on the way home from the dealer.  Guardian had one of the best prices. Crystal on the phone was professional, pleasant, and not pushy.  At the scheduled time, Jeremy arrived and he, too, was incredibly respectful and professional.  After 45 min of installation, the car looked new.  Very seemless process and will use Guardian again...next time with insurance coverage.
5	I called Bryan Ray yesterday evening after my van's side window shattered in a freak accident. The phone staff got me taken care of and the installer (Jeremy) had a new factory window in my van by lunch the following day. Can't ask for better than that!Great product. Great service!
3	This is no longer Guardian who was bought out by Safelight and this location has been closed.
