5	This place does gorgeous updos for $25 apiece. My bridesmaids and I went there on the day of (with no trial run beforehand) and we all had beautiful hair exactly the way we wanted it. The hairdressers are so friendly and attentive and so accommodating in letting 5 of us take over their relatively small shop for 2 hours on a Saturday. I was so happy to find them, and so happy not to pay $60+ a pop for wedding party hair!
5	Got my hair done in an updo (for only $25!!!!)  yesterday for my wedding.  they did amazing!  they listened to what i wanted and although it took quite a while (i have really long hair) she spent the time to do it right and exactly how i wanted it.  great service!!   The price is not high but the quality is!
5	Michelle is a godsend; went in for a simple, fuss-less updo and was stunned by the result. She is quite the perfectionist, and for $25, her mastery is bizarrely affordable. Forever bookmarked. (Note: street parking can be fairly difficult to find on S. Highland so scour the smaller adjacent streets for a free 2 hours.)
5	Great for a quick cut.  $22 for extreme attention to detail and excellent finish.
5	Rosemary is amazing for updos. Only $25 a piece but great attention to detail!
