1	OMG... The restaurant that time forgot to renovate. When I was a small boy this was the biggest outing of the year. Did I love going to the Bar B Barn! The chicken, the frizzy fries, that gravy... Whaaaaaat. Well, 30 years later nothing has changed. The menu, the carpets, tables, plates, decor, even some of the staff is still there. It's sad to see. Someone needs to call "Kitchen Nightmares" and beg for help. I'll always have the memories. :)
3	I've been in MTL for a while and I'd heard about Bar-B barn for awhile. I decided to take my Van visitors there got a late dinner after picking them up at YUL. We ordered the whole hawg, and the half chicken and fries to split. They charge 4$ for sharing which I'm not a huge fan of. The portions were huge but very tasty. If you like "traditional" BBQ this probably won't be your cup of tea. The ribs are parboiled and have a sweet sticky sauce. I happen to be a fan of this method so I was happy to chow down on the ribs. The chicken was delicious as well plump, juicy, well seasoned! Yes the decor probably hasn't changed since it opened but I'm a fan of retro so I was a happy camper. We had so much food we had to take some home. Just a good the next day.
4	Super simple menu..but hey..they do those few things very very well. .I highly recommend this restaurant
1	I have been seeing this place forever but never tried until about 2 months ago and I was quite surprise about the retro look of the place.The place was empty and it was Friday night. The waiter was pretty funny and the service was fast mind you that we were alone in there.I ordered some ribs and they were nit good at all. The outside was crispy and sweet but the ribs was very fat and not too much meat on them and very greasy.The fries were ok but nothing amazing and the rice in that little metal dish was just horrible, no taste and very muchy.Wont be going back for sure
