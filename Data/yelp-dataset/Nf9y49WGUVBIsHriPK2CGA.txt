1	If I could give no stars, I would.Bunch of friggin' crooks and they are OUTRAGEOUSLY priced for tomatoes and other veggies. They used to be cheap, but now I recommend everyone go to PA Supermarche just a few blocks west, nearer to Atwater Their produce is going downhill, especially the fruit and vegetables. Most of all, they are unethical -- telling me that I don't know the laws of the province like with price matching policies (politique d'exactitude des prix or price scanning) and their cashiers are rude.HATE THEM.
1	This place deserves negative 100 stars.I have to agree with MTL c.   Every time I've every bought anything there (maybe three times out of sheer desperation), it has (without exception) been ROTTEN inside.  So I haven't been in a while and it will be a frosty day in hades before I go back.  Go to PA instead - or eat something out of the nearest garbage can and save yourself 69 cents.Yuk.
1	Bought a chicken breast that wasn't fresh, it smells funny when we ate it. had to throw the rest away. never again for fresh produce
