5	Michelle is fantastic. I had a home bleaching nightmare and she got me right in and fixed my hair perfectly!
4	Brought our two girls, one of them who is six years old wanted to donate 10" of her hair to Locks of love. We only had to wait for a few minutes, and since it was slow. They brought them both in very quickly. Our 6 year old wanted a drastic cut, they cut over ten inches off. She was nervous at first, but they made it fun for her. By the time they were finished, her hair looked great! Our 8 year old wasn't so brave! But she did have about 3 to 4 inches trimmed. It was funny to watch these kids get their hair washed and scalped massage, they were totaled zoned out! Both of their hair cuts were great, we had a good time, and we will probably come back here for their hair cuts in the future.
3	Supercuts!  A blast from the past!  I haven't been to a Supercuts in probably 20 years.  I needed a haircut and this was the only close place open on Labor Day.  Walked in and got my haircut.  This was the fastest damn haircut I have ever had.  I was in there less than 10 minutes total.  The lady did a nice job.  I mean, I get my head shaved with a 1 clip so its not too hard to do, but still, she did a great job, didn't miss any spots lol and trimmed my neck perfectly etc.  The only thing I didn't like was the price.  $15 and $2 tip is a bit pricey for a buzz cut.  I will look for a cheaper barber next time I need a cut but if I don't have any other options, I will come back here...its a few minutes from the house.
