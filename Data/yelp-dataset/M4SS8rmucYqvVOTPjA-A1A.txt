5	RubyRide provides an excellent service to me getting around the downtown Phoenix area. My family has downsized to one vehicle since beginning to use RubyRide, which saves us a bunch of cash every month.
5	Excellent transportation for our family as we moved our daughter into the dorms at ASU. We made stops at Bed, Bath & Beyond and Target. Friendly and reliable. Thanks! All the way from Wisconsin.
1	I have been using Ruby Ride for 4 months and in that time my service started out good and ending with to email of them no longer keeping me as a client.. After about 2 months I started running into issues with being picked up late,  making me late for my training session with my client.  In the past 6 weeks, I was not picked up for work and contact 3 managers of ruby ride and no one contacted me back..  Ever.. Ruby Ride took funds out of my account with out my authorization 2 times in 6 weeks.. The last time they yet to refund my funds?  I had to call my bank and disrupt the charge. After telling then I wanted to change my plan and use anywhere card.. It got to the point I went out and bought a road bike to ride to work most the time..  7 mile one way.. I contact management in several occasions and if they did get back to me it was after 3 or 4 days.. This service went down hill quick,  after letting go of some of there best drivers.. And increasing there rates on existing clients after they were dependent on ruby ride?..  Overall I would say Ruby vide is very unprofessional, unorganized, and has a blatant disrespect for other people's time.
