5	I'm glad this one reopened in a larger location with off-street parking. The staff is nicely geeky and helpful. I picked up used copies of Finaly Fantasy XIII and the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy here for peanuts last weekend and got Darren some anniversary gifts. I'm glad to have a store like this so close.
5	I love this store! The staff is so friendly and on point that it makes every trip a great experience. I've gone into GameStops and Cash and Culture shops where the staff ignores you, plays on their phones, and sits quickly behind the counter. But I think because it's a smaller chain, the staff and management really care and constantly look to attend to your needs. The selection amount is also quite impressive. I have an extensive music taste and used to pay way more at other stores and iTunes, but I have saved so much since I have started shopping here. I also really love the new location and store. It's very convenient and close to home.
