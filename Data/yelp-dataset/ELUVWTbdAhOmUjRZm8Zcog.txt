5	I came for the first time and Dr Phong and his crew took the time to educate me on how to read my X-rays so that I can make smart decisions and understand what is exactly what I need. He is great!
5	Dr. Phong and his staff are the best, they are friendly and have always tried to make me feel comfortable before, during and after treatment.  Dr. Phong took his time to help me understand my X - rays and explained treatment step by step, his fees are extremely reasonable, When I first came to see him I was extremely upset with my smile, he did a smile makeover and it has truly been life changing I'm really happy with the outcome and quality of his work, I highly recommend him any time.
5	I came in for a regular check-up with Dr Phong Tran Cao today, and he recommended that I fixed the front bonding I have because it was cracked. Dr Tran Cao worked very quick and smooth (I think I fell asleep at one point.) My teeth now look great and clean! Highly recommend if you live in the area.
