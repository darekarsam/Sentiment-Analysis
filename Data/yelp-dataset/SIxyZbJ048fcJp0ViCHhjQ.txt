1	Horrible old chicken. I wish my tires had that much rubber. The people and the customer service is great. The product is awful.
2	We're weekly shoppers here and this week was the worst so far! They were out of the Frys 18 pack eggs with no one in the freezer to help. All the the time we're hearing intercom calls for help at the cashiers.  We get ready to check out and they're backed up big times! Another intercom call for help but no one comes. Finally get through only to have Richard the worst bag person I've ever seen. He spent more time looking at his watch than paying attention to how he was bagging our groceries!  I'm hoping they were just having a bad day!!!
