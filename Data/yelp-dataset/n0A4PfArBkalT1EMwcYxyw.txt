4	This is a real fast food place, BUT Kosher. The 4 stars is not for the food which is fine but really because mega is actually serving kosher fast food and keeps the place clean and offers lots of choice (for a burger joint). Service is friendly and I love the free refills. They are also open last and deliver for only 3 bucks. I hope this place lasts...
5	The Cholent is amazing you have to try it!The lunch specials from 11-3pm are really worth your money and taste amazing!The wings are the only thing I did not like as it was too greasy.
