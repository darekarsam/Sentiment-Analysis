4	A very small store with a good selection and excellent prices. There are some extremely good deals if you check the weekly ad.
1	pee-eww & YUCK! this place is an utter embarrassment; it's not a good representation of an authetic, reputable supermercado. my family is orig frm a border town & i can assure you that real hispanic markets are well-maintained & CLEAN. the store's bldg is cluttered, dank, smelly, & filthy. the parking lot is in an inexcusable state of direpair. the selection of products is poor & so is the quality. i lost my appetite as soon as i walked into the store (& into the adjoining taqueria) so i cannot attest to the flavor of the meats & food. take a look at the photos of the food items & i'm sure you will lose your appetite too. i was starving when i arrived so i googled other places & was lucky enough to find mariana's market & taqueria nearby. the difference was night & day. i regained my appetite when i tasted an amazing caldo de res @ mariana's taqueria. la bonita should ogden should change the name of ths location to 'la cochina' (dirty/filthy pig). do yourself & skip la bonita ogden's decrepid store, taqueria, & neighborhood.
