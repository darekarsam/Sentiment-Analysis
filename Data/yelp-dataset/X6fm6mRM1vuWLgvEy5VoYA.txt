5	Best taco stand in Charlotte. Great food and excellent customer service! Highly recommend it. =]
5	If you want authentic Mexican food this is the place to go.  The burritos are large enough for 2 to share - that is if you want to.   They are so delicious I am sure you will want to keep it all to yourself.  Everything my husband & I have eaten there (including the salsa) is delicious:-)
