5	I don't deal with people if I don't have to.  This place has walk-up ATM's, and that's as far as I go here.
4	I love Wells Fargo!  This one is a nice, clean facility with friendly tellers. If you're in Chandler definitely give this bank a shot!!
1	I am about to be a "former" Premier customer with this bank.  I have had two bad experiences with them, the most recent on 11/18/2014.   A merchant made an error and charged my debit card (used as a credit card) for $4123 instead of 123.00.  They voided the sale, however Wells Fargo will not release the money for up to 15 days!  I have the voided slip... still nothing!  If this is how you want to be treated... bank with them.  If not, find somewhere else to go to.  The fact is, they just have people read off of the computer screens and tell you "they are sorry, but they can't help you".
