3	At $3.50 tx.inc., very cheap poutine. $5 for the big portion. Very salty pre-made gravy, good fresh cheese. My only complain is that the potatoes were a little bit sloppy and not crispy enough. Overall a good cheap eat, except for the $1.75 coke can I guess.+.5 for atmosphere. After you finish your poutine, you can get wasted at the superb enclosed bar area reached by going around a fake cubicule type wall, where tons of local will join you for a pint at noon on a Friday.
4	I believe the front section is called Cafe Milan (or always was). The main reason I am writing is to let people know they now take interac/debit - or so a sign in the window shows. It's also a good place to grab a well made fairly priced coffee and use the free wifi. If you get hungry, they make a tasty chicken salad wrap and do a soup or two of the day. They usually have a whiteboard combo special or two on display near the entrance. I don't recall seeing Poutine on offer - may have to check that out next time.
4	It's a nice Cafe very welcoming and good environment to do work or just watch videos and the food is good and affordable
