3	I love my apartment. Its beautiful and the layouts perfect. Like the other review says. I agree. Pricey and parking is like you live downtown too.  Loud with contruction and this is a younger age range that lives here. To be expected. I love how the places is lenient with dogs, you don't find that really anywhere! Pros- location, beautiful, near nature and parks if you bike.  Cons. Priced higher and parking is difficult even with extra stalls Do I love my apartment? VERY MUCH
4	I was the first person to move into RIVA and have recently re-signed my lease for a 2nd year. This is a great, safe, modernized neighborhood and I really enjoy living here. I love the convenience of the centralized location (Whether you're going to east side, west side, downtown, Oregon, etc., Everything takes about 15 minutes to get to). * I would consider the majority of residents here as young professionals. * To me, the price is worth it-I'm a firm believer in 'you get what you pay for'. *Brand new apartment, safe neighborhood, convenient location, responsible residents/neighbors.* Other information/comments:-The construction is finally over so that won't be a problem for future residents. - I do agree with the statements below-the walls are thin and you can often hear your neighbors conversations. -Uber and Lyft cab rides are only $12-$14 for getting downtown to state street . -Parking is not an issue for me.-No smoking is allowed on the property so if you smoke, you should quit or you'll need to walk off the premise. (Easy for me to say, as I've never smoked haha). -On-site maintenance, gym, and dry cleaning service are a +**Having an annual gathering for the residents to get to know one another and also, a way to show appreciation to us, would be nice.**
