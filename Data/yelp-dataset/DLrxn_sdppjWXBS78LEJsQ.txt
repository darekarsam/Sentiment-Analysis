3	It's quite a while since I realised that it's simply just wrong for males to care about fashion, and during bthis period of time G-Star has went from a quite underground, niche brand you'd find in Urban Outfitters to one that's now ubiquitous for heavily-gelled lotharios who "chill" with their "mates" and read Nuts magazine. Whether that's a step down for G-Star or not, I don't know.The stuff is quite well made, and I did once have a pair of G-Star jeans that lasted a good 5 years before going in the bin, so it's not too bad. A bit tacky nowadays though, and not really on my radar.
1	This place represents everything I loathe in the lad culture. It's chavvy, it's generic, it's cheap and it's really not my thing.There's not much more I can say really.....personally, it;s a total miss. But it might be different for you...
2	Don't get me wrong, G Star jeans are OK - although now a bit too popular.  A few (OK, about 8 or 9) years ago G Star was really cool, but has become a bit too high street.The thing that gets me about this shop is that the staff talk to you as if you're their mate (sorry, 'pal' - which seems to be the most used word) and I'm probably old enough to be their dad.G Star could do better by upping the level of service and focussing on a better class of customer.God I sound old.  Now where did I leave my pipe and slippers?
