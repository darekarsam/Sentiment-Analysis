1	If you want to catch an STD, get shot, raped, taken advantage of in any way then by all means check-in. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. The health department needs to shut this place down. They have the nerve not to give a refund. Bad management. Bad attitude!
1	I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.  It is in a terrible location, the staff is not friendly, and the rooms were semi-clean.  We wanted to save $ by not staying directly down-town... next time I will pay the extra $$!!!!!!!!!!
1	Great place if your looking for some heroin and a cheap blowjob. Terrible if you're looking for a good nights sleep.
