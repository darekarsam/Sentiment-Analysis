5	it's a bridge.its job is to get you across a body of water and it succeeds.
5	Named in honor of the Lawrenceville born native who became an icon in the pop art industry in the sixties. Andrew Warhola went to Carnegie Tech and moved to New York where he found his 15 minutes of fame, using famous people such as Jackie Onassis, Marilyn Monroe, and Michael Jackson as subjects. The bridge is the middle bridge in the set of triplet bridges, and is formerly the 7th Street Bridge. It's painted Aztec Gold as most bridges in this city. The bridge is decorated with potted plants hanging from lamp posts, and banners of Andy Warhol. On the North end of the bridge is the Andy Warhol Museum, a converted music store that is the largest museum in the world dedicated to the works of a single artist.
5	There are many bridges that get a lot of attention in America. There is the Golden Gate, Brooklyn, Bay, I-90 Innerbelt to name a few of the best. The Andy Warhol Bridge is my favorite of all.
