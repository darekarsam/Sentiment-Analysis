1	This is the first time in my life I have ever been prompted to review a restaurant.  Usually the food may be just mediocre or not hot enough or the service is bad but you can live with it.  I just ordered a large vegetable pizza from this restaurant which is absolutely the most tasteless pizza I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.  It was very good size and looked appetizing, though at 17 dollars it was kind of expensive, but it had no flavor.  It was awful.
1	Terrible terrible service. I ordered a pizza. Waited an hour and called. They said it was just going out the door. 40 minutes later it arrived cold. When I called to complain they offered to bring me another if I didn't touch the other one. I went from expecting dinner at 8 to hoping for something at least warm at 10. Don't order this location. It's my worth the money you'll spend.
4	I ordered the Sicilian...extra cheese and 1/2 peperoni and 1/2 mushrooms...I liked the crust..plenty of cheese...the sauce..way better than luigi's....which used to be the best....I can't wait to have it in the morning from the toaster oven..i like crunchy Sicilian crust...the next day...I'd recommend this pizza...
