5	Very friendly and helpful staff. It's close to home and they have what I need.
3	Not sure why I checked in but they didn't have the Atkins Shakes I want. Fail. The store looks decent though.
4	I've been packing some weight since I've started yelping, so why not.  I also had Groupon coupon to use.  Customer service as always is always excellent here and at all GNCs I've been to. Knowledgeable and friendly service.  I forget the girls name who helped me but she shared a story of her losing 100+ lbs and have kept it off, good job. There wasn't anyone else there so I started to ask everything and she didn't seem to mind lol.
5	The staff is so helpful and friendly
4	This is where I buy my vitamins. My stomach can be sensitive, but their vitamins never bothered my tummy. My husband occasionally buys some energy drinks or post work out recovery drinks. I have the GNC Gold card which gets you a discount, I think it's worth the cost for savings. The employees are always helpful and friendly. The store is well organized, clean, and usually well stocked.
1	Went in looking for a pretty generic product that's pretty common only to be ignored by a young man because he was too busy on his phone and looking for his friend or someone through the window. When I asked for the items location he looked dumbfounded, just blankly stared and said they've never carried that. Uh nope I actually got a bottle a few weeks ago right here. He didn't even offer any type of alternative. Aren't you trying to sell products for your store? Guess not. Since I knew GNC did in fact have it I went up to one on ft Apache and the guys there promptly showed me the item and any alternatives to it all the while explaining everything to me. Store is clean, higher priced than online but passable. Staff though might need a big haul.
