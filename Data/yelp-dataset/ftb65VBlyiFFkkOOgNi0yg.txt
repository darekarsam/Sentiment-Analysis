3	Cool bar just between the Sherwood and Mont Royal Metro.  It's bigger than it looks.  Decent beer list, many different types of beers on tap (local as well), and reasonably priced.  They also have live music.Don't go hungry, unless you just want a bag of chips - this is a BAR ONLY.
4	This is a great small bar that we just happened upon while we were riding bikes around town.  It's on the corner of Duluth Ave., which is an awesome street.  It has a great neighborhood feel; tree lined, cobblestones, not a lot of cars, tons of small restaurants.The bar has a pool table and good beers on draft.  Full bar; cash only.  It looked like there was an atm in the corner.  No food, but they probably don't care if you bring food in. If I lived in this neighborhood I would come here often.....as in 2-3 times a week.
