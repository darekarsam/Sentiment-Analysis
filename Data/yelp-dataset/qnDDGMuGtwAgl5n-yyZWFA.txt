5	Favorite acupuncturist... Doctor Lin ZhangShe is amazing I love going there and I feel better after!I can't believe there are not tons of reviews on her already. She is absolutely fantastic and I am so glad to have her as one of my "wellness" people! :-)Dr. Zhang rocks!
5	I've been going to Dr. Zhang for the past 9 months and she is the best!  She has helped me with so many issues and my health has improved tremendously. Contrary to my previous conceptions, acupuncture does not hurt. Dr. Zhang has excellent bedside manner and treats the root of the cause, unlike Western medicine that just tries to treat symptoms.  She is very educational too and has given me strategies and tips to try at home in between visits.  I HIGHLY recommend her!
5	Such an amazing acupuncturist. I've been going to her for 16 years now and she's absolutely wonderful! Nothing gets rid of my migraine and cluster headaches faster then going to her just twice in a week.!! I just love Dr. Zhang!
