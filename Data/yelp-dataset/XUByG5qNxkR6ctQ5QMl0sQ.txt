1	What a whirlwind of a place.  I took the time to print and fill out the new patient forms from their website, only to find out the forms are current.  Awesome waste of my time.  The doctor spoke in medical terms I didn't understand, I had to keep asking her what she meant.  There are so many people coming and going, a literal turnstile of a place.  Which wouldn't be bad if it didn't feel like a turnstile of a place.  And the entrance door could use a treatment of WD-40.  That door open and closed dozens of times while I was in the waiting room - so loud and creaky.  Speaking of waiting.  I wasn't seen by the doctor until 45 minutes after my appointment time.
5	I really like dr. Mona Amin. Always a pleasure to see her. Wish I never had to be at this office but I sadly have arthritis. My favorite rheumatoid doctor I've had this far. Great bedside manner and practical.
