3	Rent is cheap. Expect a lot of calls to maintenance because units are older and need a lot of work. Appliances are cheap and probably have to be replaced often too. Neighbors keep to themselves and the majority speak spanish. Hot tub has been broken for who knows how long. Pool stays cold in the summer. A lot of kids running around the complex without parents watching them. People in bikes selling food daily honking a horn. Laundry room usually has clothes and trash in the washers and dryers. Cops are here weekly checking up on many of the tenants. Parking is first come first serve. It is a pet friendly community. Most of the strip malls in the area have been closed down due to the recession.
4	Moved here over a year ago. Was able to move in a timely manner into my apartment. Staff is extremely helpful, neighbors are friendly and it's quiet. I love this place.
1	I moved here a month ago and so far there has been negligence on the maintenance part. As requested upon move in, I called in the maintenance line to fix whatever needed to be fixed. To no avail, nothing has been done. I called in multiple times, spoke to the office staff countless times, and still maintenance hasn't come by to fix everything.My apartment is by the pool and it is so loud until about 11-12AM. I have an early morning so I need my sleep, so you can imagine how annoying it is. Also neighbors around me are very loud out on their patio, sometimes fighting.If you can, avoid this place.
