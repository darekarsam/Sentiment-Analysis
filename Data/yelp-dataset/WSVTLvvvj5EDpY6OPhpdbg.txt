4	From the outside, Manna Mahal doesnt look anything special - just a simple and standard Indian restaurant. Nor does it look anything special on the inside, traditional looking and plain.However, how the restraunt looks isnt why I come here time and agin. It's the food.Always well flavoured and good quality the food is simply outstanding - its the equvalent of your mums home cooking. Simple, delicious and morish. Further more, they do it as a take away, and thats great as well. The food is also remarkably cheap.Service in Manna Mehal isnt anything to write home about, but it isnt awful either.So there you have it, great food and a nice (if plain) setting to eat it in.
3	As others have said, Manna Mahal doesn't look like the snazziest joint in the town. However don't judge a book, or an Indian Restaurant, by its cover.I first tasted what Manna Mahal had to offer when a takeaway. I was pleasantly surprised. I came back again and sat in. This time I was a little less impressed. The food wasn't quite what I ordered and overall it didn't live up to me previous experience. This could have been a bad night because I have ordered takeaway again and it has been fine. The prices are really good, especially by Edinburgh standards, and portions are a generous size.If you don't mind simple curry and simply decor and you like good Indian food, check this place out. I wouldn't recommend it for showing fancy dining, but for straight forward takeaway/lazy night out, your on good ground.
