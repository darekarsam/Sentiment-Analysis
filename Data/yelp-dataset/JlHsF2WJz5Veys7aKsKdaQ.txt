5	George and David are wonderful. They keep things very low on the s Eng and chemical scales so if you are sensitive this is the place to go.  Love getting my hair cut and styled there with David and my facials with George.

5	Such an amazing place to get your self back in tune from head to toe!!! David always does a fantastic job on my hair and the pedicure was so relaxing feels like walking on air. Top it off a body scrub by George with reflexology CLOUD 9! And even get rid of some unwanted hair. One stop shopping thanks guys!
