5	Susan has an amazing collection of yarn, books, fiber and equipment- much better than any other store in the area I'm aware of.  She's also very friendly and helpful (if anything, she'll talk your ear off :)
5	Susan's is a great local shop that I enjoy visiting whenever I'm back seeing my family. Nestled a little bit in the middle-of-nowhere and yet pretty easy to find, the shop sits happily amongst the working outbuildings of a beautiful sheep farm. Lots of happy wool inside and out!Susan is a gracious host and shop owner and was brilliant in helping me with a unique special order a while back (all via email). She's always up for a chat and is an interesting lady.  The shop is well-stocked with a variety of yarns that I've not found at other yarn shops in Wisconsin. This shop is definitely worth a short drive to the country!
5	I've shopped at Susan's for 35 years.  It's the best place for quality fiber and yarns, as well as equipment.  Prices are always the best around and her expertise is shared without reserve.  She's so knowledgeable about spinning, weaving, felting etc.  Don't miss going to this huge shop if you are in the Madison/Sun Prairie area.
