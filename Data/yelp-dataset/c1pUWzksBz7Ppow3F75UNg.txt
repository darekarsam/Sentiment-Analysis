5	High- end skincare & cosmetics lines, looking for something in skincare /make-up, perfumes not easy to find.. Penhaligon, Tocca, Dermalogica, Skinceuticals? Here is the place! Personalised service, make-up, skincare consultations, advice, there is an esthetic salon upstairs for treatments should you feel like it.  Looking for something different or something you've been searching high and low for,  try this place .
4	This store is really sleek, clean, and if you're into make up, moisturizers and all that fun stuff (whether you're a guy or a girl) - this could be your haven.The woman working behind the desk was super helpful, knowledgeable, and so sweet. She'll help you figure out what you need for yourself, and not for the store's personal gain. However, it is expensive, so... I guess it is their gain either way!
4	There are very few places around that sell a line of skincare that I love, Environ. While in Montreal, i figured I would stock up since I knew that this place carried it. Even though I could find it in Boston, I still sucked it up and paid double the prices lus the ridiculous QC taxes, but its worth it when you need it.The woman that helped us was very friendly and spoke english, french and franglais! She was also very knowledgeable about all kinds of products and make up, but I wasn't there for make up. Anyway...I'd go back here if I needed to!
