5	My husband went here to print out flyers for our lost dog.  Luis let him use the computer to print out the flyer and made 50 copies.  My husband grabbed a roll of packing tape and as he went up to pay, Luis refused to accept the money.  He even posted a picture of our flyer on his Facebook page.This kindness is so rare and unexpected, that it always takes me aback and touches me deeply.  When someone goes above and beyond for no other reason than to be a good human being, it should be acknowledged.  We appreciated it so much in our time of crisis and sorrow.  We never did get our beloved dog Jackson back, but people like Luis restore my faith in humanity.  I'll never forget this stranger's love and compassion, please give this store your business!!
1	Dropped off a pre-labelled UPS envelope on Sept. .15th.  I was returning business forms that were moderately important.  A week later they had not been received and were not in the UPS tracking system.  After the package was in "limbo" for almost 2 weeks, I called the Mail Store.  They told me UPS picks up every day but continued to search while I was holding...after all, I had a receipt proving they accepted it on 9/15.  They found it on shelf ...it was Sept. 26th...Inexcusable!!  I will never use them again.
5	Service is the best!  Needed to have a package shipped in a rush and they were able to not only accommodate but assisted in packaging and beat the competitors price.  With few honest and reliable small businesses left in this town, this shop is a pleasant surprise.  A true "diamond in the rough"
