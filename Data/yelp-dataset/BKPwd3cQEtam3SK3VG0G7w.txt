3	by default, i went to espresso since it is so close to my school building.  the drinks in general were too strong for me in the beginning but it grew on me.  my favorite drink to order is the white mocha.  i recently started getting it with hazelnut to make it a bit sweeter and now that is my favorite.  if i don't get that, i'll go with the double trouble mocha.  and you can't be $2 latte wednesdays!!!!  another good drink to try is the vanilla yerba matte tea.  it's good for ya and it tastes good to top it off!  their polar freezes are not so good, has a strange consistency.  i would not pay for that again.  don't forget your punch cards (9 drinks, 10th free i think), i've earned my free drinks in the last year!  their pastries are okay, not my first choice.  but sometimes when you need a donut, you just need a donut lol.  they also have sandwiches, soups, chips, and candies if you are in a time crunch and need something quick.
5	Great espresso with solid rich flavor. Nice selection of pastries and a few sandwiches. Great indoor sitting area. Limited outside seating.  I'd come back.
