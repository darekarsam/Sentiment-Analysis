4	This place is way cool. They got hot waitresses to bring you drinks. Sometimes they haggle you for drink tickets but it is never a problem for me. I like the parlay cards they have and I head here for that particular reason. The people here are way cool. There are many locals that come here. I have gotten some good leads here in the past. They were telling me about Nevada Reno and San Jose St. Football. I guess they did their research and it turned out good for me. I had some entertaining conversations here and met some good people here. I do win here more frequently than anywhere else. I do get into arguments often but that at this joint. If you get hungry there is a Panda Express, McDonald's, pizza, a Coffee Bean and many other food options nearby. No reason to not give this place a try. Sometimes they give out gifts like a commuter mug and some other stuff if you have a member card. They used to not take bets on the NBA but I think that has changed now.
4	One of the less crowded Sportsbooks in town with high ceilings allowing for ample smoke clearance I spent just under an hour watching the Browns and Lions kick off their preseason here last week and although the gamblers themselves proved as quirky as ever it was the quality of the screens and the comfortable chairs that caught my attention, the later particularly pleasant with all leather upholstry and ample padding for hours of sitting...or perhaps a quick nap as it seemed many were using the lounge for such purposes that evening.
