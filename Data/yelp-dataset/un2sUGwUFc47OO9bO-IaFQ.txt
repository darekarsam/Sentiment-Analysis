4	Was this tent built at a time in history when people were apparently shorter?  I don't think I've ever been more uncomfortable at a show in my life.  My 6'4" frame was clearly not made to be crammed into these seats.  My apologies to the family in front of me who got well acquainted with my knees in their backs for two hours and also to  the family behind me whose view I must have been blocking with my melon head.  Ok, now that the complaining is out of the way, this show, Kurios, was my first experience at a Cirque show and, despite my discomfort, it was pretty amazing.  I had a slight fear that I'd be bored with act after act of acrobatics, but it was so much more than that.  The stunts, costumes, humor, and of course, the music all just come together to make something so uniquely entertaining.  It's happy, it's sad, it's dark, it's dangerous, it's just all over the place emotionally in a good way.  I'm very glad I took the $80 gamble to see it.  Obviously, Cirque has shows all over the world, including at times just 20 minutes down the road from me in Boston, but it was special to see it for my first time in its home city.    Five stars for the performance aspect, but minus one for the cramped venue.
5	Always a blast, what can I say! They're entertaining, mind-blowing, and mesmerizing! I've only ever seen Ovo and Kurios, both of which I experienced in VIP/Tapis Rouge, which in my opinion is the best way to experience it. Can't wait for what else is to come.
