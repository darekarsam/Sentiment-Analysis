5	The deep fried ice cream. Is the best in town come and test it, and the three  meats molcajete the best,with chicken, Steak and pork ranchero style awesome.
5	Total authentic Mexican dishes, a total must try if you are in the Nellis area. Restaurant is family owned and operated and the staff couldn't be more welcoming. Can't wait to go back and try more of their menu!
4	We started with a shrimp ceviche tostada and one with fish.  Not worth trying but I've had some awesome ceviches.  Spooned on some of their salsa and it really helped the ceviche.  Maybe their cocktail version is better.  I got a enchilada and chile rellano combo and was really surprised.  They have a great red enchilada sauce.  It is flavorful, thick, and really goes well with the rellano.  Can't give this place give stars because of the tostadas but I will be back want to try some of their other seafood dishes, and more of their food in general.  Service was great also.
5	Great Mexican spot! The carne en su jugo is very delicious and the Seafood Molcajete IS A MUST TRY!!! Hospitality at it's best, greeted by the server and the owner. Chef came out to check on every table. Authentic taste, I will definitely be going back.
5	Went here for a quick bite after work was very impressed great food and cheap prices.  Very friendly staff the cook even came out to make sure we were happy with our food.  Not to mention I loved the chips mmmmm
5	Amazing food! I visited the first week they were open and was blown away by the  authentic menu! Be sure to try Molcajetes!
4	DONT JUDGE THE BOOK BY ITS COVER!! This place looks ghetto on the outside and we almost just passed, but I am so glad we didn't!!! It is beautiful and very clean inside.  Staff was very nice and attended to us quickly. The food was delicious and authentic. We are going to be regulars here. I'm really glad we gave it a chance
