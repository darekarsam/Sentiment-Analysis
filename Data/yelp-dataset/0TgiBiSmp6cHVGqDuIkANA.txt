3	My mom and I had lunch today at this little restaurant. The food wasn't great; my mom liked the coffee she had, but the mushroom risotto she ordered wasn't stellar. The butternut squash soup tasted entirely of rosemary (no hint of butternut squash, other than the color, could be detected) and was served so hot that I had to wait at least ten minutes before it was cool enough to eat. Admittedly it was the soup of the day, so if you visit you're unlikely to be subjected to it! The service was very friendly, it had the polished decor of a nice restaurant, and the atmosphere was pleasant. Overall, we enjoyed spending time together during the meal, even if the food wasn't perfect.
