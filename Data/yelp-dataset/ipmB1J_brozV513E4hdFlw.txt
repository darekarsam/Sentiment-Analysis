4	Superb authentic Mexican cuisine. Incredible prices. Lovely tiny place (16 places inside/16 outside) Great terrace in back with fresh herbs growing in it. Charming staff. Dishes changed frequently. Great drinks both fruity & alcoholic. This a brand new establishment & they often have only 1 waitress. It's worth the wait though we have been there a number of times and have always been served promptly. Great homemade food like this takes time to prepare. That's what appetizers and cocktails are for! Already booked my birthday party here!
4	Really good AUTHENTIC Mexican cuisine! I love their guacamole - they put the ingredients in a large mortar and pestle and you mix it to your preferred consistancy.I felt like I was back in Mexico when I went to a good local eatery and experienced good food. It's not Americanized at all and tastes homemade.
1	This place appears to be closed.  We went (after reading the rave reviews here) on July 21, 2012 and the place had a for rent sign in the window.  Bummer!
5	It WAS as good as it got but is sadly closed. Ah mi corazon!
3	They are closed (and have been for awhile) :(
