4	Busy location! People that work there are very nice and attentive.
1	I had been very pleased with this location until I received an unsatisfactory pie. I tried to reach the store, which I understand they are very busy so I emailed. I was surprised how fast mr. Ferdenzi  the area supervisor responded. He was very apologetic and offered me another which was above and beyond. I received the replacement and ate a couple of pieces and noticed  what I thought was cheese in the center of the pie was sticky. It turns out the dough was raw. So again I contacted Mr ferdenzi via email. I have tried two additional times to reach him to no avail. Needless to say I will no longer do business with them.
1	Confused why this location will only deliver to me sometimes. Very frustrating when I only live 2 miles away. Make up your mind, do you want my business or not?
