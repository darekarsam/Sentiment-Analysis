3	Cuts are average to good depending on who you get. Not my location of choice.
5	What can really be said about a hair cutting venue from a guys perspective?"Uhhh" well first off, services rendered. I come in for a haircut about every month, get a #3 on the sides and a trim on the top. Aside from any wait I may encounter, if my haircut takes any longer than 10mins, there is something wrong. Luckily, I may have only run into this delay 99 out of 100 times of back n' forth. That same proportion holds true for the quality of the haircut. Although it is hard to accurately determine the EXACT lengths and trims, these hair dressers usually pull this off and I have zero complaints. Wait times. These vary, but I don't really mind them as the "line" moves quickly. Fortunately Great Clips now has a pocket app (still have yet to download) to make appointments via smartphone. Genious! Locations. Great clips locations are in abundance. This one in particular is clean, has quick service, and employees are generally very friendly. Highly recommended.
3	Cheap haircuts, done quickly, especially if you check in using their app. My only complaint is that I never seem to see the same person twice, so there is no way to have someone used to the way you want your hair done.
