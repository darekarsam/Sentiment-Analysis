5	I was attending a conference at the San Marcos Hotel in downtown Chandler.  Whenever I attend a conference, I like to get out and explore the local businesses, even if the conference is in a suburb of my very own city.  So, when the sessions ended @ 5 p.m. on Thursday, I went strolling through Chandler's very charming downtown.  Because women are biologically programmed to be unable to walk past a shoe store, I stopped into Shoe Thrill, because, happily, they stay open until 8 p.m.I was like a kid in a candy store!  They'd just gotten in a bunch of fall inventory, and the brands they carry are brands I love!  I fell in love with a pair of Allegrias that were 50% off, and they had them in my size.  I wanted to wait until my paycheck was direct deposited, so I promised to come back the next day.When I returned on Friday, the staff remembered me, and brought over the shoes I wanted.  I shopped a bit more, and purchased two more pairs of shoes.  One of them was a pair of black nubuck Olukai loafers I've wanted for a while.  I'd seen them in the Terry catalog and REI online, but I really like to spend my money locally, whenever possible.  They are amazingly comfortable.  I am happy with all of my purchases.Shoe Thrill has an fantastic inventory of gorgeous shoes and boots.  Service was friendly and casual.  They also carry some purses, hats, and jewelry.  I live downtown Phoenix, but I will willingly travel to Chandler to shop @ Shoe Thrill again.

The sales associate was very knowledgeable and friendly, the shop was clean and cute, and in my favorite part of chandler. They had quality shoes, great prices, lots of my favorite brand names and best of all, my size!
