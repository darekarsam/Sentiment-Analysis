5	Great local shop with extremely helpful staff.   Anytime I need an award or trophy I will be coming to this shop.
5	Small local trophy shop with amazing customer service.  They really pay attention to detail and care about making the customer a quality product.  If your in search of anything that needs print on it I highly suggest the Trophy Den
5	I am so impressed with the Trophy Den. I will never go anywhere else to get any of my trophy, awards or plaque needs met. I had an urgent trophy need met today, the day before Thanksgiving. They were so helpful. They helped me pick something out and then they took care of it and it was ready within hours. It was also less expensive than any of the full prices I found online. I will only use the Trophy Den moving forward. Plus they've been local since 1968.
