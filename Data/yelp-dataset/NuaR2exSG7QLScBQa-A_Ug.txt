5	Close to strip. great place to come to so you dont have to get roobbed by casino ATM'svery secure after hours. must stick card in to enter ATM Area.and plenty of parking!
4	I've been a Wells Fargo customer ever since. And this place has been my go-to bank because it's close to my house.One thing i like about this location, is that they have a very friendly staff. Their front desk associates are so friendly and accommodating. Every time i step my foot on this bank, i'm always greeted with a smile!Parking is not that bad. There are more parking spaces at the back space of the bank. There's also a Walgreens and a lot more stores nearby.Mind you, when it gets busy, it gets a lil uncomfortable too. Let's say i go here regularly and when it's busy, most of the customers are men.One time, i was wearing a cardigan and a long distressed shorts. It wasn't revealing at all! I look at them, and i feel like they were all mentally undressing me! Is it because of the holes on the knees of my shorts? LOL how uncomfortable that could be!
1	Very dangerous to use ATM at night!  It's located  on the back of the building with a brick wall  on your right, completely hiding from view.  Safer to drive to the one on Las Vegas Blvd and Clark, very open and lit up like the 4th of July.
3	I stopped here to use their ATM.  The Wells Fargo app showed me this was closest to where I was.Being at night, I parked and went for the front door to use my card for entry.  This location doesn't have that feature nor is there an outdoor ATM that faces the street.Instead, you have to go down a narrow driveway behind the bank--not one of the safest places to get cash at night.Being cognizant of my surroundings, I got the cash I wanted and then left.  It was convenient, but I do like the other way of unlocking the front door where you're in a mores secure, lighted area.A-OK--barely.
