5	Great service at the bar, very friendly. Tried the mussels, which were delicious, and filet bites, which were just small pieces of steak with a choice of two dipping sauces. The Bloody Mary sauce that came with the bites was good, but the pesto was outstanding. Highly recommended. I was sitting at the bar with my gf when Bryan Callen walked in, and we decided on the spur of the moment to catch his show at Tempe Improv next door. While we waited, a live band set up and played right behind the bar. Overall, a really great experience. It's a little different than the Cityscape location, but has enough similarities to feel comfortably familiar if you've been there. Definitely worth checking out if you're in Tempe.

5	Have to applaud the service and camaraderie at this awesome place! The band we got to hear, Black Bottom Lighters, were not only great musically, they were really nice guys.The manager, Jackie, is one of the most accommodating ppl I've met and extremely professional.The bartender, Jaramie, is as cool as her name.Anyone who is smart enough to come here will be glad they did!
