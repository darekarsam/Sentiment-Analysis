4	While they can't quite compete with Tesco on some levels, Morrisons does have a unique charm that sets it apart from it's fellow supermarket chains.Being a Yorkshire-based company, Morrison's origin shines through in their stores. The butcher and deli counters have an old fashioned market-town style aesthetic applied, and meat  and potato pies and pork scratchings are readily available. All it needs is a few whippets, and a bearded, truck driving serial killer to complete the atmosphere.The fact that Morrison's do stock a few things a little bit different than the other supermarkets is it's main plus point. I've always been a fan of the old pork scratchings and though their competitors have now caught up, Morrison's were the first to start selling them in Scotland. Likewise the pies, cakes and bakery products just look and feel that little bit more homemade than elsewhere. The guys at the butcher counter even still wear what I can only describe as "butcher's hats", and it's those little  touches that  do it for me.
