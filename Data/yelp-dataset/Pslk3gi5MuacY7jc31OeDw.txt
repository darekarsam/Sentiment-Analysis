1	Horrible experience. I'm usually not one to complain, but this was just bad. When I arrived at the counter, the lady was busy messing with some machine, so I stood there for about a minute waiting to be greeted. That didn't tick me off as much as the fact that the place was untidy and unorganized looking. I ordered my drink, she began to prepare it, only she was using a pitcher that had residue from the last drink in it. She poured the reminder of those contents in a cup and continued to make my drink. I didn't say anything since it looked like strawberries and my drink was one with strawberries although I was still disgusted. I left the counter with my drink, tasted it and thought about going back, but hesitated because I didn't want to be a pain. I continued to drink and it was just bad so I had to take it back. When I get there I explain the issue, but she's making someone else's drink. She starts to make mine, and again puts it in a used pitcher. I asked her to rinse it and she does so with an attitude. My drink still wasn't right, but I left anyway. Needless to say, I won't be returning here.

3	My experience with this Dairy Queen/Orange Julius location has been average.  It appears that a family runs and operates this location (typically friendly) and it offers the most basic of offerings at DQ/OJ.  Typically, I get a cone or a blizzard, made to order.  The soft serve is made correctly and creamy; while the toppings are decent and not runny.  It is what it is, no thrills here, just decent soft serve ice cream.
