5	Great service. Good prices.
3	Ok. Not much more. Pricey for most services and average services at that.  The front desk reception is just an area for 6 people greeting you like they are doing you a favour. Not much in the area in the way of spas and that is the reason they stay in business. Not much in the way of competition really. A place where west island women go to say they went.  The massages are pretty good, mani/pedis ok but over priced and the facials are average.
