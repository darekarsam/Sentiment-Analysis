2	The rating says it all; "Meh".  For a supposed "outlet store", it seems funny that the prices are comparable to any big-box retailers that sell Bose products.  Bose used to be "THE" name in home audio.  But, with the rapid growth of technology, it seems Bose has chosen to invest more in their marketing than in their product's technological relevance.  It's not that the store is bad, per se, just over rated and expensive.
5	Sometimes bad things happen to a tech nuts equipment that breaks one's heart. My Bose Bluetooth was lost & damaged.  My heart dropped; I called the store & talked to the GM. Either they would trade it out, I'd had it 2 months, or I'd pay $75.00 for a replacement depending on the damage. I Prayed!!!!  The store manager is wonderful!  She traded it out which is a tremendous blessing. I love this store! I've shopped here & in different states & I've only had good experiences overall. Thank you for being my blessing!
1	I don't usually were these reviews......however.....I came in because I was told by female employee that if I brought myOlder pair of Bose headsets in, I would receive an amount off my new pair. So I did this. Apparently I had to be buying the exact same pair to get the discount. No big deal. However, the big deal was the rudeness of the middle aged lady manager (same one I spoke to before). It is not my job to be knowledgable of your policies. That is YOUR job. When you explain your policies to a customer next time, try not to roll you eyes or act like They are wasting your time. I will not purchase Bose again, especially from this store.
