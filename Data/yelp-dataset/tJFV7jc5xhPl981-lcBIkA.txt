4	This is your typical senior RV park in Mesa, AZ. There are tons of them out here - 75% park models and the rest RV's. These folks keep the place looking good - clean bathrooms, laundry room, grounds, pool area, etc.  It is a huge park with 2 pools kept very warm - one is a lap pool and is a bit cooler. The 2 jacuzzis are very hot - like 105, but I'd rather them be too hot than not hot enough! There is a nice billiards room, sewing room, wood working, leather making, lapidary, card room - they have it all and then some. Live music plays many afternoons with dancing & this year they added a tiki bar that is open from 1-7, 6 days a week. They also have concerts and special dinners.  The list goes on, but their tennis courts are many & lit, they have a great softball field with bleachers, shuffle board, pickle ball, you name it...they got it.I was a little freaked when we first drove through the place - like, I just don't think I can do this! But I LOVE IT!!  Granted I couldn't get in the place without my 60 yr old hubby but, the internet is good, we have a lovely spot and nice neighbors.  Everyone is friendly enough and we even extended our 2 month stay another week.  We have made rezzies for next winter, although not completely sure we will be here, it's only $50 to cancel, which is better than not being able to get in here at all - the place is so busy we know peeps that couldn't get in!
