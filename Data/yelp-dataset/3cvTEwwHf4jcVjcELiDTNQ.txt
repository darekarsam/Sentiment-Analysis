5	The salted caramel cupcakes are simply sinfully decadent! I'm not big on cupcakes, in fact I find most chain cupcake places overrated with either only the cake being tasty with too sweet or too thick and almost inedible frosting OR where the frosting is good but the cake is dry or ordinary. The Baking Cup changed my mind about cupcakes. Both the salty caramel and chocolate Nutella are anything but ordinary. Very flavorful without being overbearing. I will certainly be back for more!
5	Absolutely Heaven!!! Everything from the baking cup is amazing but my personal favorite is the Oreo layer cake.  I  wish I lived closer to enjoy more often, so if you are visiting  Vegas make it a must!
5	Last Wednesday at the farmer's market I noticed these guys with their cupcakes.  I bought one to take home, and now I can't wait to get another one this week.  Just heavenly.  Very fresh and delicious.
5	My husband and I are always on the hunt for yummy sweet treats. We found this gem at the farmer's market we frequent. After numerous times passing it by (I'm a cupcake snob) he talked me into trying a red velvet and a smores cupcake and they were perfectly moist and delicious! The following week we tried the chocolate chunk cookies and a pumpkin smore, the cookies were so soft and chewy, yum! Yesterday I tried more chocolate chunk cookies (I may have bought nearly her whole stack) and a pumpkin monster cookie, so freakin' good. I love how her desserts are the perfect amount of sweetness, she doesn't over do the sugar. We are fans! Even me, the cupcake snob!
