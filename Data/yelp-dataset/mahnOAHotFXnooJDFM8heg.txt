3	Don't be fooled by it's location and the looks on the inside. This place is amazing and Cheap!! I was able to feed my entire family for under twenty dollars!!!
4	This place is a diamond in the rough. It's location and looks fool you. But once you taste the food you'll be hooked. Very good and reasonably priced. I eat here at least twice a week!
3	I used to come here quite often, but hadn't stopped in for over a year. I decided to try them again on the way home. I ordered the House Fried Rice and egg roll. The egg roll was very good and the rice was ok. The service is pretty fast and cordial. For fast Chinese food on the east side, this is a good alternative.
