3	We came here really hoping this place could be our "Monks" but was sadly disappointed.  Overall, so-so diner for the price. I ordered the special: BBQ pulled pork with 2 sides for $5.95.  The BBQ pulled pork tasted and looked EXACTLY like LLoyds (pre-made BBQ at the grocery store). I got mac-n-cheese and cucumber salad  for my sides.  Mac-n-cheese was okay, not enough flavor for me...Cucumber salad was whack ... all it was was sliced cucumber and water.  My husband ordered the Yankee Wrap (Chicken strips with Buffalo sauce with tomatoes) with a side of potato salad and fries.  I found myself taking bites of his leftovers. That dish was a lot better than my special.  We plan to give it another shot and try their breakfast items.
