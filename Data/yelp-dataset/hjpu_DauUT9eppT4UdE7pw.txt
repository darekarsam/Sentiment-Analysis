5	David at Ohana is absolutely awesome.  A man who truly takes pride in his work. He uses high quality products and has an incredible attention to detail.  My car hasn't looked this good ever, even when it was brand new.  The paint is smooth as glass with a deep deep reflection and the interior is show quality on my 5 year old car.  I would recommend Ohana to anybody who values their car.  5 stars accross the board!
5	This is the business to call if you want a serious detail. My car was trashed, the interior was stained & looked bad. The owner of ohana detail made my car look almost brand new & cleaned up old coca cola stains from years ago. He even lifted up the dash to get under to clean up dirt. Most car detailers won't do that. He did an amazing job & it was beyond my expectations.  Thank you!!!
5	This company is highly recommended for anyone that wants a very thorough detail. I had stains in my car from years ago that were removed. He even scrubbed down my coin tray that had coins stuck to it from having a drink spilled in my car. The owner was very punctual and professional and informed me of all the high quality products that he used. I only ordered an interior detail and he was kind enough to clean the outside of my car for no extra charge. My car looks as new as the first day I bought it. Also, I had requested the detail over a week ago but due to the weather, he said that the interior wouldn't dry properly because of the moisture in the air; It would probably smell like mildew afterwards. Instead of making money on a rainy day, he suggested I wait until the weather was better. Not only is he very detail oriented, he is honest.
5	Absolutely the best detail I've ever had.  Incredible attention to detail.  He went above and beyond to correct imperfections I didn't know were there. Top notch work and amazing customer service.
