5	I went to discuss some Immigration information with Andrew, He was  professional and informative. In the area of Immigration you need to have assistance with someone who is keeping up with what is going on in a constantly changing environment .  I recommend this practice highly.
5	My wife and I worked with Andrew to complete her petition for permanent resident status.  His expert knowledge and helpful attitude made this complicated process much more bearable.  Although it is possible for someone to read the USCIS rules, complete the required documents, and submit them, I'd highly recommend meeting with Andrew because this area of the law changes quickly and his expert assistance will minimize the chance of delays or issues.  I highly recommend his office and his services.
4	Very thorough consultation, answered all our questions, worth the $100
5	I met with Andrew this past week, and was blown away with how he took the time to get to know what my exact circumstance is.  He asked questions, and presented many options for me, along with very in-depth instructions on how to carry through these options.  He was very professional, and personable.  He was highly knowledgeable and made sure I had all my questions answered, sending me on my way with many print outs of information related to my case.  I have been to two other attorneys in the valley, and they didn't come close to measuring up to my meeting with him.  Thank you!!
