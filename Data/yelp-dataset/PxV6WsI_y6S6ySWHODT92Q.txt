5	What I like best about this place is that the owners are front and center most of the time. I like that they care enough to come out and meet their customers. I purchased a new leather riding jacket and they were very patient with me and let me try on all the different styles so I could get the absolute best fit. Also, whoever their buys is has very nice taste as the shirts and other accessories are all very classy. I signed up on their mailing list and they send me information on special and 20% discount cards all the time. One time, I received a free pair of sunglasses with my purchase... pretty cool cuz I seem to be good at losing glasses! Anyway, I do recommend you check out this store if you are looking for riding gear. The staff is always very welcoming and the prices are very fair!
5	I don't understand how this place has only one review!Anyhoo.I go in this morning feeling like such a rookie.Going for my endorsement this weekend and needed proper boots,a helmet and gloves.Andrea was so unbelievably nice and helpful without "selling".She knew the products,was able to give me some pointers and options.I was a little reluctant going in as a first timer for safety gear and not wanting to come across as some douchette poseur.Their stock and prices are great and I even got an added discount for being retired MOS.Looks like I'm off to a good start on my next chapter.Thank you Andrea!
3	Sorry not too impressive the owner seems a bit catty and two faced don't like the fact that it takes two weeks to send out to have the stuff done in the store so please tell me what is the sewing machine for if you have to send out to get your work done not pleased not at all I would recommend somewhere else
