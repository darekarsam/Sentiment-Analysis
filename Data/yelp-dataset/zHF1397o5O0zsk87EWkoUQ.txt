4	I have physically been in this location to order a meal, and my company uses them regularly to cater 200 chicken or steak teriyaki bowls. They always do a great job. The food is always fresh, hot and delicious. No complaints about Samurai Sam's or their delicious eggrolls.

I have been eating here for 5 years, and you are there always making sure your customers are happy, You must know 10,000 people by name.And this is one of my weekly lunch habits. original small bowl, dark meat chicken "veggies on the side" YEPPP!! I love a good Teriyaki Bowl.
4	Small place, maybe room for a dozen sitting customers so i got mine to go. Food is good i think i dealt with the owner, he was really nice all his employees seemed to be in a good mood which made for a pleasant atmosphere the 3 minutes i waited for my food. To recap, good food, nice staff and good prices. 4 stars. Thanks!!
