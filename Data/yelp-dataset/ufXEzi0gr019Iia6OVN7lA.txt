4	I visited Fu Shing II for first time last night.  I had wondered for over a year if it was going to be just good chinese food.  So I decided to try the basics....shrimp fried rice and spring rolls.  Very impressed.  The rice was cooked well...not oily or greasy.  The shrimp was tasty!  The spring rolls were very good.  Fried wraps filled with just enough veggies!  I did not eat in since this is a very small location.  There are two tables.  I think it is more for order and go.  But more than just walking up to a window to order (like the good ole shops in Philly)!  Two other critical things for me is rating....and the fact that they do not use MSG!!!  I will be returning for my periodic need for fried rice...and will try other items.
1	I went late for a quick snack.  I ordered 2 veggie spring rolls.  They were bland, tasteless, filled with iceberg lettuce, and when I asked for soy sauce, I got one packet.  As an added bonus, the woman who took my order and another guy were eating in the open kitchen, right next to a huge bin filled with egg rolls.  Sooooo gross.Won't go back.
4	Basic takeout joint which happens to get it right.   Been using them for 2-3 years.   Never disappointed.
5	My fav Chinese take out. Their food is not greasy like other places and they always get my order right. I drive from UNCC sometimes for take out.
3	They have good lunch specials! The food is good.
2	Ordered moo shu gai pan, pork chow mein, fried dumplings, and crab ragoon. The rice was dry, noodles are greasy, they used canned mushrooms, and the egg rolls were bland. Rather eat Panda express.
