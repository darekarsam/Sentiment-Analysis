5	I was extremely impressed with the professionalism and quality of work these guys did for me-- I had a tricky repair question that I had already unsuccessfully taken to another area mechanic, and the mechanics of TK Service Center were able to successfully locate and fix the issues in less than a day's work.They were prompt in communicating the status of the repairs to me throughout the day, took the time to explain exactly what repairs were made in simple language, and did not default to an expensive part replacement for one of the issues I was having.  TK Service Center also offers a shuttle service that took me home and picked me up the next day.The repairs were not inexpensive, but the quality of work and integrity of service that I received from TK Service Center meant that the money was well spent.  I will gladly return in the future.
5	These guys are great! I am not from the area and was traveling for work with a colleague when my 2013 ford escape made a noise and a whir and basically broke. The local ford dealership was SO RUDE to me and wouldn't see my vehicle to determine what was wrong with it. These guys not only took my vehicle right away, but showed me exactly what was wrong, and found a solution to hold me over until I could back home -- all within an hour. Beyond that, the price was beyond fair, and they gave great restaurant recommendations for us to kill time at while we waited.
5	Last we were about to go to Chicago and they helped us fix the problem in the early morning in an hour and asked for a very reasonable price. It turned out to work very well. Before that, we actually had took our car to another place and they asked for a lot more, both money and time. I'd have to say TK really saved our day and I definitely plan to return if I need  further help with my car.
