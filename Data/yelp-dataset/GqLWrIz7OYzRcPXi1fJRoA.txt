3	Very simple authentic dishes with a focus on a few select menu items, I was dissapointed doner kebabs(spit cooked meat similiar to Gyros) were not on the menu during the week.  The hummus and olive oil spread we started with were obviously made with very high quality ingredients and were portioned appropriately for two people to share. The yogurt kebabs were served over fried pita pieces (unusual but very good) and was well seasoned.  The service was exceptional, although the place was completely empty. The owner mentioned moving locations due to lack of traffic recently. I plan on trying again during the weekend when they have a full menu.
5	I had a great date here one night. I'm surprised it's gotten such low reviews...I thought the food was great, the service was great, and the decor was really nice. It was a memorably good date, though, so maybe I had stars in my eyes and thought everything was better than it really was. The server talked with us just enough to be interesting without being annoying. He was a youngish guy who was in some way related to the owners...I can't remember his name, but he was great. We were also there on the night when they had live belly dancers...Thursdays...but I missed the freakin' show. Every time I've ever tried to go to see live belly dancers, I miss the show. I have some kind of belly-dance curse...but apparently, the belly dancing is fun, and the girls get the folks at the restaurant involved if they're interested. Seems like a good time...but I wouldn't know, as I was like 2 minutes late. Bah!The little fried pieces of pita underneath my date's yogurt kebabs were amazing. They melted in our mouths. It's worth going out there for the pita bits alone.
