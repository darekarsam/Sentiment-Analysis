3	I used to listen in the mornings on the way to work, as they have a decently entertaining morning radio show. Other than that, I sometimes tune in to see what new hip hop/rap song they've got playing.The morning show is hosted by Brotha Fred, a local celebrity in Charlotte. While it's neither hilarious or informing, it can be quite entertaining at times. I especially like the Friday Bro Fro segment, which I think is fixed but nonetheless entertaining. It can add some spice to your morning commute & appeals to more of the young professional, early 20's crowd. It's more hip hop & pop than anything else & in the morning they play probably a little too much music for a radio show.
1	Cj used  to be a radio host in Atlanta. Where I had the pleasure of hearing his down syndrome like voice constantly. As you can imagine I was less than happy to hear that he was in Charlotte. Now every time I go to Charlotte I must have my Ipod freshly updated with songs. Just the mere thought of scanning the radio and hearing his voice is enough for me to keep the AUX button on my entire trip. Good job Atlanta for letting him go. I'm sorry city of Charlotte.
1	Worst station on the planet!  In DESPERATE need of new blood, especially the morning show!  If you want a GOOD station that plays today's hits, just go down one number and listen to 95.1 instead!  Don't bother with this station; they're the go-to station for Ryan Seacrest!  So if you want to tune into a station to listen to two guys in the morning talk smack about NOTHING or RS waste your time until 2 PM talking about the Khardashians or Miley Cyrus (yawn!), by all means this is the station for you!  If you want GOOD MUSIC, go elsewhere!
