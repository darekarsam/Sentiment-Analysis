5	I was assigned Mike's Plumbing with old republic home warranty yesterday at 440pm. I spoke to Didi and explained I have had a sewer issue since sat. That's days ago. Didi scheduled Fernando within the hour and Fernando had a can do attitude.  He assessed the property and the issue and made calls immediately to Old republic asap b4 old republic shuts.off at 6pm. Fernando showed up today like he said he would and jetted the clean out.  Even though old republic home warranty did not give an allowance for a camera, Fernando brought one out to help him understand the sewer lines...Wow!!!I am very appreciative of Fernando and his team. You get 5 stars in my book. Y Khoo. Rpme Realtor.
5	Mike's Drain and Plumbing really are the BEST. They work super hard and they have THE friendliest plumbers! I've used them for YEARS and will continue to do so!
1	$50 service call to tell you its $400 to snake a kitchen sink....no thanks.  Called another licensed plumber, done in 15 minutes and less than $100.  Great way to make $50 and hour with never having to work.  Very disappointed, enjoy your $50!!!!!
