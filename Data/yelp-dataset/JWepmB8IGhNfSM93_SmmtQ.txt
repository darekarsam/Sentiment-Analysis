5	Clean and intimate tattoo parlor on the plateau started up by Joe who usually works there along with one or two other artists.  Joe is friendly, accessible and versatile artist who's open to feedback. His work ethic is phenomenal. He'll power through long sessions, staying focussed on the piece. He will critically evaluate his work after the fact, revisiting it as need be to make sure that it's as good as it can be.
5	This is a great shop with a great owner. I was very fortunate (or lucky) and got a session after walking in. Jonathan was very welcoming and worked with me to perfect my design, even talking me out of going overboard. His work is amazing. I defiantly recommend this shop.
5	I got my first tattoo here today, and start to finish it was a great experience. I had researched a few shops and visited a few, and settled on this one when I met Christina, who did the work. Her work is skilled, and her demeanor was warm and welcoming. The same can be said of all the staff. I could not have asked for a better first experience. I suspect it won't be too long before they see me again.
5	Called Jonathan and started talking over the phone and email about what I was looking for. He worked me into his very busy schedule. He was direct and forthcoming with feedback and artistic direction. When we met face to face, he got me in early and took good care of me. I love my ink and can't wait to show it off. I'd definitely recommend Private Tattoo.
