5	Friendly service, and fair pricing. Was even given a ride back to my house while car was serviced, and was picked up upon completion. Will be returning.
5	The guys at Sports Car Service Center do a great job. I first brought my Lexus IS there in 2008 after a recommendation from a friend. They quoted the work to be done and I found it to be substantially less expensive than the Lexus dealership and other local shops. The key, as with any auto shop, is to find guys you can trust. Cal and Tony are the epitome of that. They have the expertise to prioritize the work that needs to be done and help lay out a plan. They also have partnerships with other shops when the scope of work falls outside of their wheelhouse. I'd still be using them if I lived in AZ.
5	take your Saab here. enough said.

5	Traveling across the US and my Saab decided to stall at random times. I called a number of Saab service places. Tony was the only one that would listen to my Saab story. I got my car there and they were able to recreate the failure and fix it. They tested it for a couple of days as I had wanted. When I picked it up the bill was less than expected. Now I have driven 300 miles and no stalls. Not only that it drives better than it has in a year. I can't imagine taking my car anywhere else. Even considered moving so they can work on it. So if you have a Saab I can't imagine going anywhere else.
