5	A favorite of mine to eat at when I go to Pittsburgh... Italian food, a small bar when you walk in, tables to the room to your right more tables in the back, nice atmosphere.. great food.UPDATE: Abruzzi's has moved into the Day's Inn I believe, and I have yet to visit it at it's new location.
4	I've been here a couple of times, both times the service was good, and the atmosphere was calm (When it was next to the Holiday Inn).  They serve up some Italian food classics in a cloth napkin kind of a place.  I have to drop it down a notch because the second time I went, I was sadly disappointed by the main dish.  The bread and oil and salad appetizers were very very good, so much so that I even asked for the bread and oil to go!!  They did give me a replacement main meal and credited my dinner, but it was still sad to go so sharply downhill after the delish beginnings of the meal.  Now it looks as the door has shut on Abruzzi's and it has been replaced by Amalfi's, so look for a review soon to see if it shapes up on the Italian food front.
4	This place closed?! That's sad. I haven't been there in a few years, but when I went it was delicious. A hole in the wall, but delicious. And the owner gave us free dessert. Butter me up, and I'll give you four stars.
