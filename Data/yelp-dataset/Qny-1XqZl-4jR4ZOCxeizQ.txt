5	I had a great experience at this location. I was greeted when I walked in, my wait time was short, I felt like the radiology tech and office staff were all very knowledgeable, and I definitely recommend this location to everyone!
5	They are always awesome here. Each employee introduces themselves, then explains their part in what will be happening that day, and the part they will play. It is fast, clean, and everyone is always willing to chat personally while the patients wait. The woman next to me wanted to tell them ALL about her every issue, although they were busy they listened, sympathized, then got her moving. Very sweet. The parking lot isn't full, and it's clean. What else could you ask for?
3	The medical services provided were wonderful. The worst part about the facility was they required me to pay upfront almost $525.00 for testing when I advised them that my insurance would cover those procedures.  I paid them on 9/30/14 and still have not gotten my money back and the insurance has paid them 100% of the cost.  I've been told they will audit the account and that it may still be another 3-4 weeks.  Really- take my money and then I have to call almost every week for the next three months to get it back.Please be aware of this when you go in for testing!!!It's awful, do you think they will give me my refund with interest since they had my money for so long.\?
