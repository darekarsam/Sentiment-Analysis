5	It's Canadian Tire, an institution.
5	I called this morning to get a rack for my bike.  I found out later that I had spoken to the assistant manager.  His attitude was a 10+++ and even though he was obviously French, he spoke every word to me in English. After the call I got into my car and drove right to the store to make the purchase.  I was met there by another sales associate who was equally helpful and polite.  I will be making this my "go to" store and I suggest you do the same. !!     ** I had made a previous call to purchase a bike rack from a place on 5040 Boul. Met E. (514-721-2886) aptly called:  Hitch Bike Rack.  The man who answered the phone could not understand the English work "bike-rack".  After 30 seconds of trying to explain to him what the product was he was selling, it was clear that he did not want my English money.  Cudo's to Canadian Tire on this one. They came through for me 100% ++++   Thanks!!!
