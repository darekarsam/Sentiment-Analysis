5	Honest and trustworthy. A family man that helps others with what they need. I highly recommend Jonathan as your insurance agent! Plus Liberty Mutual is a great company! ALSO if you are a homeowner and you get a free quote form him... he hooks you up with free tickets to Harkins... dont tell him I told you this :/
5	Jonathan is an expert in customer service. I have referred him to my clients and used his services myself. I would recommend Jonathan for all your insurance needs!
5	We recently changed from Allstate to Liberty with Jonathan and the difference is amazing.  Jonathan was great to work with and helped us with another policy in New York with our 21 yr old son.  We highly recommend him.
