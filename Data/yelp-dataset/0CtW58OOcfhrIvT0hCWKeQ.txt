1	THEFT ALERT: We just found out that thousands of dollars in tools that were stored in a 400 lb, thick steel box and secured to a trailer with kryptonite locks were stolen at this storage facility. We have been told the "manager" will not be available until March 6 or 7th and that they are not responsible for the theft. Sadly this wasn't a quick theft as it must have taken a good amount of time to get this 400lb box off the trailer. The Store More website claims a very secure facility as well as surveillance monitors. According to the employee "there are no cameras in that area". The loss of our items doesn't appear to be much of a concern to this company which is why I will be doing my best to make sure everyone in the Queen Creek area is aware of this situation. We understand that Store More can't be responsible for every theft, however the website should not say this is a secure facility with surveillance cameras if there aren't any. We are very disappointed not only about the lack of security but by how we were treated.
1	I've had a unit here for two years. They tried to increase my rent by over 26%! I had to fight with them and the corporate office just to get it knocked down to a 19% increase over the two years! They know it's a hassle for people to move all there stuff once it's in storage and there are no regulations in place to keep them from raising rent prices as much as they want, whenever they want!
