2	I called for pricing and although their prices are very reasonable I will be using another limo service for our roundtrip from the airport to the hotel, in Las Vegas.  I found the young lady who gave me the information slightly rude and unprofessional.
5	This is a GREAT company! Driver was waiting for us at baggage...helped us with our bags. Friendly..professional...no hassles at all. Already booked them again. Reasonable prices too. Tried of the dirty taxis...Well worth the money!
1	This company is a complete joke, total bait and switch. I booked our airport transportation 9 days ago (for service in a few weeks) & received confirmation.  It was their advertised $45 limo to hotel service, yet they sent an updated confirmation today for $100?!!! I emailed to question it only to be told that they were sold out and booked us with a "sister" company.  For TWICE what I booked it for???  I asked them to honor it or cancel is and I would leave negative feedback, clearly they don't care about customer service.
