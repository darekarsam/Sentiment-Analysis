5	Let me first start off with saying WOW! This place is amazing super clean and the food is out of this world the waffles are made to order of course and the staff is by far the best their personality just made the experience complete the service was speedy and attention to detail you ask for it they make it happen if you want smothered waffles you got it and the waitress Miss dee and Miss Red where great!! All I can say is that I'll come back any time!!
3	To me when I think of the Waffle House breakfast is what comes to mind and of course it's always really late at night and usually always with bunch of friends. You know that moment you been out partying or just out late doing whatever it's 1 o'clock in the morning. Your buddy's say hey let's grab something to eat, usually at night your choices are limited so it's only IHOP, Cookout, or Waffle House that's open to choose from. To me I classify this type of a restaurant as a greasy spoon dinner it's not a bad thing it's just a particular type of food you can always count on no matter what city you're in. I give it a late night thumbs up !

4	As far as Waffle Houses go, this one was pretty clean.  I enjoyed the waffle and their coffee was surprisingly good.   Our waitress was probably well over 60 years old and she was the hardest working waitress I have ever seen - she hustled
