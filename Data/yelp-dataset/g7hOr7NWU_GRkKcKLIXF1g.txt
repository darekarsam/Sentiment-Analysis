5	Niki does amazing work. She took pictures for me and my husband after our wedding.  We're not from Vegas but she took us to great location and did an fabulous job. I would highly recommend her to any and everyone looking for any type of photos done. She captured my special day. Thank you again Niki for all that you did for Kyle and I.
5	Niki did an amazing job! I was on a budget and wanted some pictures of my boys. She made it work with what I had. The location at the park was perfect and the pictures turned out great! Some were posed, some were random, but they all showed my sons personalities shining through. Then she not only sent me a few "tease" pictures but delivered the disk to my home very quickly. She is very professional and made my boys feel at ease. She will be our photographer for all my future events.
5	Niki is such an awesome photographer! She did my wedding and was more than I could have ever expected. She doesn't just take your photos she cares about you and your story :) call her you will regret it if you don't
