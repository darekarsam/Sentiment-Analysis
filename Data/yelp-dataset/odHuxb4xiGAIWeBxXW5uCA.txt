5	Asia colored, cut & styled my hair & I was very, very happy! This was my first visit but will not be my last! Highly recommend.
5	This was my first time here, and to be honest I'm not one to afford much more than wal-mart or super cuts but I have never been happy and NEVER go back! But I Got a coupon out of the local Surprise paper for HOT DESERT HAIR, made the appointment with Cheryl and WOW, WOW, WOW!   Its not just the hair cut that is the first in YEARS that I have LOVED ......but the service too! She knew I was nervous and  went above and  beyond to make me comfortable.. I wish I could have tipped more! I have to go back and HIGHLY recommend her!Thanks Again Cheryl!
5	This place is a diamond in the rough! GREAT STYLISTS..GREAT PRICES..AND NICE SALON! Good location..I highly recommend TAMMY for cut and colors. You dont need to pay exorbanant prices in an "exclusive"salon to get great results! Come here..you wont be sorry!
