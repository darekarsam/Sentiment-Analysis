5	Great selection of pastries !
4	I like their Portuguese tarts, with sugary custard and chewy tart shells (instead of the eggy-tasting and flaky Hong Kong-styled ones). The price is not bad, but sometimes some items taste like they've been in the fridge for a bit too long.
2	All desserts are pretty but they have the same taste. Nothing special. I am portuguese descendent and all food here don't look be prepared from scratch. And the servers take a long time to even notice you are waiting for them seating on a table. They are so inpatient. I have been here 4-5 times and I promise don't come back any more. Only cash or debit card.
