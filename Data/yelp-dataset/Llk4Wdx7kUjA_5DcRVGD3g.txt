5	I have a severe dental phobia that's been exacerbated over the years by poor dentist work and innumerable traumatizing experiences.  I came into her office, crying, with my mouth a total mess.  Not only was her staff welcoming and friendly, but she herself was probably the most compassionate dentist I have ever seen.  I had a panic attack in the chair during an oral exam and she gently rubbed my shoulders until I calmed down.  She takes her time to do a complete exam and explain all of your options to you.  She remembers you even if you haven't been there in a while.  Her staff is gentle and kind.  I have gone to her, sporadically, for almost two years now and have undergone some major reconstructive work (with more coming in the next few months) with her office.  She has always been amazing to me and I have always left feeling very positive about my experiences.  I dare say that, because of her and her staff, I am eager to get dental work done.  I truly feel that they just want to care for me instead of root around in my pockets. Now living in San Tan Valley, she is pretty far out of my way.  But I'll make the drive for the quality of care I receive.

5	You've heard the expression, "I'd rather have teeth pulled?" - right? Well, guess what, it's certainly an attractive option if you're going to have it done at Dr. Hilarry Douglas' office. You couldn't ask for a better DDS, or staff. From the moment you walk in the door and are greeted by Chris, to going back  beyond the service door and seeing Kali's smiling face greeting you from her desk, to sitting in the hygienic seat of Jackie, or reclining back with mouth wide-open, being worked on by Dr. Douglas --  it is a pleasant experience.
