4	Supercut stereotypes aside, I got a really good cut here at this location from the stylist... Paula I think was her name.  Great value for the price, so of course make up for it with a heartwarming gratuity.  Plenty of parking, nice shopping area too.
4	Courtney did a great job. Very clean establishment. Easy to get an appointment without the long wait.
5	I am very meticulous about my hair. Supercuts was the best I have had in years. Highly recommended!
5	I'm new in town and also a hairstylist. Mallory did the best haircut that I've had in yrs. !!! Thank you and most certainly will be back !!
5	As others have said, Supercuts is typically a crap shoot however this location has  superb stylists. Bree gave me an exceptional fade and I will be back to see her.
5	I've been going to this Supercut for years and they consistently do a GREAT job!  During that time I've had many different stylists and all of them have been wonderful. The call ahead feature is really nice (when I remember to do it). However, more than often I walk-in and have never waited for more than 30 mins. The place is really clean and the staff is friendly. The only thing I'd love to see them change is the bench in the waiting area. It's not too comfy. :)
