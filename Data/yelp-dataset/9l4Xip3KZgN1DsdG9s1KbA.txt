4	Cheap Mid-Eastern, Mediterranean -style fast food, prices very reasonable- WHOLE grilled chicken only $14.99,cheapest I' ve seen in city yet. We ordered at the counter,I had paella with a side of green beans Mediterranean -style ,but the food was barely warm. The dessert pudding was really yum though. This place just opened,so I expect they'll fine tune this at some point. Two floors, they can accommodate groups for private parties, and it's a bring your own wine joint to boot. Not too bad a choice for cheap eats downtown.
5	Great food at very reasonable prices. The quality of this food is excellent. The Taouk platter and filet mignon platter are both inexpensive and taste great. Downstairs is fast food style and upstairs is sit down. I haven't gone wrong yet.I eat here at least twice a week.Best Value lebanese style restaurant in city. I have also eaten upstairs a few times in dining area. For under $20 / person you get a great meal. Its rare my kids leave full at any restaurant, but at Scoozi the portions are large and the food quality is very good.
