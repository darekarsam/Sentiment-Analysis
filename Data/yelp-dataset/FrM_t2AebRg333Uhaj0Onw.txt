5	I stopped in and Debbie cut my hair perfectly. I highly recommend her! I will be going back for sure.
1	BEWARE.  I went there for the first time last week largely because of the price stated on their website.  The website indicates a price of $15 for a man's cut.  This is about the price one pays at one of the chain shops so I decided to try this private salon thinking I might get a better cut and find a new place to go for a hair cut since it is also close to home.  I don't know the name of the lady who cut my hair but as she prepared to cut my hair she brought over a towel, sprayed down my hair, dropped the towel on the floor, and proceeded to wipe the excess water from my face with the towel she had just picked up from the floor.  Unbelievable.  When I was ready to leave she told me the price was $20.  I complained saying the price was $15 on their website, but she didn't change the price.  I paid the $20, gave her a tip, and will NEVER be back.
5	I can't say enough wonderful things about salon 84. I found Salon 84 3.5 years ago when I had an appointment to have keratin treatment done with a hairdresser in tempe, for a wedding in Costa Rica, just 3 days before I was flying out. I desperately needed to have this treatment done as a previous hairdresser destroyed my hair! So much damage it was breaking off and eventually I lost about 5 inches of length. Anyway, this hairdresser that was going to do my hair cancelled on me 30 mins before (for personal reasons) and I was freaking out. I called salon 84 and told Mitra my situation and let me just say, even though she didn't know me AND had an appointment to receive furniture that day, she cancelled her appt and took me in! She not only did the  treatment but saved my hair and my budget! I've been here ever since!They are always willing to squeeze you in if they can and they listen to what YOU want. This is my permanent salon! Great place and people! :-) 3 years and counting! Give them a try! :-)
