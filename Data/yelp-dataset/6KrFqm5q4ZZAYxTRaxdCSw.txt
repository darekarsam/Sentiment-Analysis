4	Some fantastic sweets.  Sampled some cookies and delicious cup cake with Raspberry Mascarpone Frosting and lemon pound cake.
4	I live right around the corner and finally had the chance to stop for breakfast treat with my sweetie.  Had the bacon cheese and chive scone.  Soft, moist, flaky, yummy!!  Worth the stop especially if you want something nice for the weekend.
