3	Mid day and weekday so I was t the only one in the store.  The young man who worked there knew what I was looking for and helped me find it then I mentioned protein bars and he said most people really like the quest bars... and I remember reading quite a few reviews online for another place where people were looking for them at a better price.  Lots of flavors (I get so sick of chocolate protein bars/drink) and on sale so I bought a dozen.  I hope they are as good as everyone says!!!
2	The staff was very rude and unhelpful. They did not answer any of my questions directly and did not treat me with kindness and respect. Definitely never coming here again.
5	I highly recommend this store ! the staff are very helpful and friendly! They are very knowledgeable about the products.
