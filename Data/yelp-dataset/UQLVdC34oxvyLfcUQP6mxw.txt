1	We made an appt 10 days ago, prepaid for it , showed up on time and after waiting a half hour to be seen and ignored we walked out.  Reception staff was surly and the facility clearly didn't respect our time or the appointment.  No contact from the company apologizing.  This is NOT a company to do business with.
5	Such a great easy program. I've tried it all and been very impressed!! Down 50 and counting. Have and would recommend this to all my friends! I love doing to all the locations when I need to and being able to work with great professionals. Jennifer was awesome!!
5	My experience at Barosolutions we excellent. As soon as I walked in I noticed the free coffee while I waited for my appointment (I was early). I went to the Scottsdale location, it was really nice inside. I was referred here through a coworker who told me she did the program and it was covered by our company's insurance. I was also surprised to find out how comprehensive my appointment. They took my blood for a food intolerance test, food allergy test, and regular lab work(cholesterol levels) then I was given an ultrasound on all my major veins and arteries as well as my heart. Next I met the Nurse Practitioner who had me fill out a questionnaire to determine which weight loss program is best for me. (I was prescribed Phentermine). Then I met with a nutritionist who helped me figure out a diet plan based off of my food intolerance and food allergy test, who I will also meet with for the next six months to monitor my weight loss. It's been about two weeks on the food plan and I've already lost 9 lbs. Overall great experience and the best thing is that it is covered by my insurance.
