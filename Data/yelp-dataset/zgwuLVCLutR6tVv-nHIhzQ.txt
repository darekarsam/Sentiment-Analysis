4	So good, I stopped in twice in the same week.  My favorite sandwich of theirs is the "Vegetarian" (which I am not).  Pressed olive loaf with cheese, egg, avocado and lettuce.  Outstanding!!Their fig salad is quite tasty as well!Oh, and free wireless internet (ask for the day's password) is always a welcome plus.
4	Green is a new age cafe featuring modern design elements which really give it a clean polished look. The decor is very bright with ample lighting, large windows, plenty of white furniture, and subtle green accents.The guy behind the counter was extremely friendly and didn't mind helping me get familiarized with the neighbourhood as he prepared my order.The food menu looked pretty decent, but I was only craving caffeine and vitamins at the time. My cappuccino was good and came with a little hint of chocolate atop of the foam. However, freshly squeezed OJ is what really got my day off to a good start. I also appreciated the complimentary copies of La Presse and pitchers of cold water with clean glasses near the coffee station.Having a nice cafe just steps from my accommodations was a real blessing. The only downer was that they're only open from Monday - Friday.
