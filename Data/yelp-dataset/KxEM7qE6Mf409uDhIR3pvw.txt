4	This is the flagship location and it's a great spot to have your vehicle cleaned. It also has gas which is convenient. Lots of options from full detail to ride through wash. You'll get great service from the employees who will want to get a tip from doing a great job after your car goes through the wash.
4	They do a pretty good job at this location; I've been to several around Charlotte and I'd put this one as my #2 or #3.  I don't have any complaints really; they do a fairly good job with my vehicle, the young guys and gals always seem to be in good spirits, and after having purchased an unlimited program from them for $40/month, I'd say I'm pretty pleased.  This location is in a great spot as well since it's right outside of Midtown, so I usually pop in after getting my Trader Joe's fix.
3	Autobell is my go to car wash, but it is a car wash. They do a good job, but I truly think it depends on who picks your car up to dry/clean whether you have a good experience or not.  I mean the machines do their job, right?  The workers are the ones that actually wipe down the car, clean any reminants, and dry it/tire gloss, etc.  Some visits have been better than others in my opinion.
