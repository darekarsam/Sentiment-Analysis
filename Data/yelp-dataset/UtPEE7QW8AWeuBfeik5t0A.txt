5	The airports with mini museums and art galleries just tickle me! It is a wonderful thing to be able to enjoy a dash of culture with all the other mania that goes on in airports. I can think of a some other airports with fun displays and bits of history, like Dallas, Charlotte, and San Francisco with little displays that help eliminate the sterility. Thank you Phoenix for your part in the Art world!
5	I never realized SkyHarbor has a museum. This is probably due to the speed at which I typically enter and exit. The Museum's collection is apparently spread across multiple Terminals (2,3 & 4) and the pieces are on multiple floors as well as at the airport location. One of the the wonderful thinks about SkyHarbor is their collection of over 600 pieces continuously rotates. So, unlike SeaTac (Seattle's airport), where the scary magician adorns the walls, Sky Harbor has something fresh and for everyone. We visited the terminal 3 collection which currently features antique clothing from the early 20th century, an incredible bird and sculpture collection and a miniature oil painting collection. This was spread across multiple locations on the second floor atrium prior to security. Take the time to enjoy the art as it makes the security experience less stressful!
