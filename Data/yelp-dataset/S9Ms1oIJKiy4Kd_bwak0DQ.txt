1	This place is a cesspool, hands down the worst Circle K I have ever been to.  I used to work as a driver and have seen my fair share of Circle K stores throughout the Valley and it is not even close.  This store could be demolished tomorrow but the stains would remain for an eternity.  If you should have the misfortune of running out of gas in front of this store, do yourself a favor and push your car to the Circle K on 83rd or the QT on 99th Ave.  Just stay away.
3	how can you rate a gas station?  it pumped the gas, i get a receipt.  there's a lot of construction around this circle k so unless you are driving by i wouldn't bother.
3	Who doesn't like gas station junk food? Love their snacks but hate going by myself. There's always shady people hanging out outside either drinking or asking for money to buy more booze. Their gas isn't the cheapest either, other gas station always offer it for at least 10 cents cheaper. Can't beat the 79 cent polar pop though!
