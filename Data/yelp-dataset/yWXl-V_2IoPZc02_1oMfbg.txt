1	So, I have been here a few times with my kids who always tend to get sick on Friday evenings. First off, let me say that the nurses I have dealt with have been great!  But, niceness can only get you so far. My latest experience was with my youngest who was suffering from a pretty high fever for several days. I took him in as soon as they opened and we got right in. She told me my son had a super bad ear infection in both ears. So, we were given antibiotics. After two doses, my son broke out in a rash so I stopped the antibiotics and took him to our pediatrician.  To my surprise, she said his ears were crystal clear and perfect and there was no way his ears cleared up from 2 doses of antibiotics. I am giving one star for the misdiagnosis. I will not be going back and will just take my kids elsewhere.
1	Waited one hour -only one dr scheduled and he only  saw only 2 patients during that time -4 patients ahead of me so I left. Plan on sitting on ground while waiting bc only 3 chairs for waiting patients. This is a good concept on paper but execution is horrible. Will not  return.
5	I came here over the weekend due to really bad head aches and the left side of my face and jaw feeling numb. The wait was about 30 minutes and there was only 1person ahead of me. I came in around 6pm to try and avoid a line and maybe just got lucky. They said I had an ear infection and prescribed some antibiotics. The doctor was nice and really fast in finding out by my symptoms what the problem was. The visit was covered by insurance and I was just happy to not have had to wait hours to be seen. Nice doctor and fast service. If I ever need to come back I know the best time is in the evenings.
