5	We are on number 3 in 13 months from Wagon Trail. They are the best of the best. That is why we keep returning. The team they have put together there is awesome. John, Rusty and everyone else. We were first time RVers and not only their honesty, but the confidence they instilled in us that we could drive these was wonderful. They just keep getting better. We highly recommend a stop there and a long look. You will be amazed at how low key and welcoming they will be!!!! Those looking for an RV owe it to themselves!!!!
1	I bought a used 2014 Roadtrek from this dealer. After I paid my money and drove to the campground where they host you for the night, the RT began leaking antifreeze. They had me drive to the Mercedes dealer in Henderson and left me there for 2 days without ever following up. I am not local to the area and knew no one. Other things such as no water in the windshield wiper well, and a  missing washer in the water hose were typical of their service. A back screen on the RT was ripped and their head of service said the screen was "nothing but a nuisance anyway, and I was better off just getting rid of it." He also tried to turn the Clarion back up video camera  which worked only intermittently into a regular camera. I am a new RV owner and the whole thing seemed to be a bit like a slapstick  comedy.  I would avoid this place and I am being kind...
