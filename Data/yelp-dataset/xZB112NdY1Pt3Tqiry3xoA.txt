5	Amazing:)
5	Debbie, the owner, has been doing my hair, as well as my mom and sister's for years and she is absolutely wonderful!!! The quality of her products she uses are the best you are going to find, and she always makes sure to keep you laughing while she is doing your hair! This salon is new, but the stylists here know what they are doing, the prices are reasonable and it is definitely worth giving it a try!!
5	Great atmosphere! All of the stylist and staff are extremely talented! Love the location! Definitely enjoy it here!
5	I have known Debbie for a few years. She truly loves what she does, and that is to make all of clients feel beautiful and special. I am glad to see her expanding her wings.My stylist and artist of hair is Leon Crandell. He makes me feel special and always takes his time and listens to what I have to say. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and even if you have had a bad day, when you leave your will feel relaxed and beautiful.
5	I have had many great experiences here with mani/pedis, hair cuts, and facials. VERY clean, great atmosphere, amazing service, and incredibly affordable prices! This is an extraordinary group of people that go above and beyond! I bring my whole family here and recommend these guys to everyone I know!
5	Amazing deals! My stylist ALWAYS does an amazing job! Can't help but love the atmosphere when I'm here! Highly recommend this salon!!
