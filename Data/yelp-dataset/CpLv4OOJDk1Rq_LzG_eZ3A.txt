4	The vintage collection at General 54 bust out into it's very own space next door and it's great! Lots of stock with a focus on interesting actual vintage, and very fast paced turn over of garments driven by the owner's collector love, and good taste, and neighbourhood support. Cool art projects, wonderful loving team behind the shop, well worth a visit and time spent trying adventurous vintage on (summer dresses! just sayin.)
5	As far as vintage goes, this is my ideal way to shop. Pieces were carefully curated and organized (I'm talking arranged by colors and patterns), which means less grunt work for me in finding what I want. I ended up buying so much, the sweet lil lady gave me a "bulk discount", and now I'm sold for life. The next time I'm in Montreal I will definitely pay a visit. You just don't find that kind of quality and variety in nyc!
3	L'annex Vintage is a kind of Hispter store with clothe for lady mainly. The section for Man is limited and for what a big Men of my size would call skinny dudes. Anyway, my again (as I was mentionning in my General 54 review, the Annex is the store connected to the other one) it is mainly for ladies and not really a cool place for guys
2	Great variety and reasonable prices but the customer service leaves something to be desired. I'm never greeted when entering the store and its rare that the sales staff will ask if I need anything. I would shop there more if they had better service.
4	They always have some really nice things in stock, although the bags can be a bit more pricey than other places. However it is definitely one of the nicer vintage stores in Montreal as it is clean and the selection is usually good.
3	Items were nice, but some pieces seemed to be overly priced just because that certain look is in. Additionally, I agree that there is a lack of customer service. No one wants to shop and spend money where they feel like they aren't welcome.
