4	Like most of the Uptown stations, East/West is at ground level. It's a couple of dozen yards from the actual road and is surrounded by two and three story buildings, mostly condos or apartments. Not a whole lot of open space. So I would be cautious if you're here on your own late.As Jeff mentions, there are emergency call stations. There is also a ticket vending machine on each platform. On the LYNX system, you must purchase your ticket before boarding and I have seen ticket collectors often. Not every time, but most times.

4	Convenient to the intersection of South Blvd and East Blvd,  the East/West Lynx station is just like the other Lynx light rail stations in Charlotte.  There were a bunch of businesses already in existence in the area so the station didn't really change much in the area, just how accessible it is to be downtown from here.  I like that there is one of those new bike sharing stations a couple hundred feet away, which makes it super easy to get around and tour Charlotte/or get around to run errands etc.Watch the cars coming down East Blvd though.  While waiting for a train, a couple of lets call them "drivers" thought it would be a great idea to speed up and beat the crossing arms that were coming down for an approaching train.  Luckily they made it, but some people just don't have any common sense....
4	Its a light rail station yaaaaaaay!  Clean, very well  lit, and the ticket machine works again!  I have seen ticket collectors hear a lot, so don't try and sneak on. Usually on a friday or saturday night you will see a bunch of drunks headed uptown.  If you are looking for a place to park and ride, I would go to scaleybark.  Though this is a good spot to get off and hit tyber creek, common market, or price's
4	Great street parking spaces along both sides of the road, what is there not to like?
