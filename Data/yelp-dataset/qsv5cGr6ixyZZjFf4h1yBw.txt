5	I love Hair Oasis! I take both my daughter and myself to get our hair done there! I have had no complaints! Whenever I have needed to get in, I never have a problem! I love my newest cut and color! Prices are extremely reasonable. I'd recommend Hair Oasis to anyone!
1	I bought a deal with groupon for this salon and called and left a message to schedule an appointment . I didn't receive a call back until 4 days later... We play tag calling each other back and forth, she never NEVER available to take my call!!!not only was it annoying, it was extremely rude. We finally scheduled an appointment for the next month, I waited at least 3 weeks for my appointment witch she wasn't available on weekends so I took a day off of work. Turns out the stylist was sick that day so I took off work for nothing. After that I called to reschedule about 500 times I realized how unprofessional this salon was and decided to leave a voicemail expressing my feelings and only then is when I got a prompt response. I told her I needed a refund and she was no help, just told me I need to talk to groupon. I highly recommend taking your business elsewhere this busy lady obviously doesn't have time for you, so unprofessional......
