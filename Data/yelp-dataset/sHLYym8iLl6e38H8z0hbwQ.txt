5	I have been seeing Dr. Shoemaker for 14 years now. He is a terrific doctor. My family also goes to him. He is a very kind man who takes his time with you and makes you feel like you are his only patient. He covers all bases in your health and i highly suggest him.
1	I just called Dr. Shoemaker's office to make an appointment and was told the next available appointment (maybe due to being a new patient, I'm not sure) would be in over three (3) months.  Is he that good?  I think not to wait over three months.
5	Thanks Dr. Shoemaker for being my primary care physician in the last 3 years!  It's good to know I can schedule a visit anytime I don't feel 100%.  You're always thorough and willing to listen.
