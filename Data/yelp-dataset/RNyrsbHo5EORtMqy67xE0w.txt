4	This one i have to give props to my Rough Guides Montreal.  Just four tables and a long counter in this hole in the wall diner, which prides itself on on traditional Quebecois cuisine served here since 1938.  The feves au lard is the house specialty which is a simple yet rich baked beans dish.  I had the pleasure of talking with the owner Phil who was a wealth of knowledge as to where i should eat next.  To finish off my trip to La Benerie, i had pouding au chomeur, which translates to unemployed bread pudding.  Yummy.  I would say a must stop if you really want the full Montreal experience.
3	I tried to "walk" up an appetite before my lunch at La Binerie Mont Royal. I am all for comfort food as I do find comforts when I eating.....La Binerie does worth a visit... not for the food but for it's history as it was opened at 1938 almost 75 years ago .... and the set up and the menu still remain the same.Tourtiere ($8.95) is definitely not my kind of comfort food as I found it a little dry, really dry.... Boudin Noir with Pea Soup ($10.95) Pea soup though is really comforting.. The black pudding has this gluey texture but I love the apple sauce that comes with it... Great place for breakfast/bunch as they serves all day breakfast at a reasonable price...
3	Great old fashioned food except for the OWNER'S audacity to request a tip for his service.. Completely taken aback Makes you NOT want to return and kinda turns you off
