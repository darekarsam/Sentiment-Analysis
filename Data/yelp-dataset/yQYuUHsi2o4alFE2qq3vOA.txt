5	One of our local favorites!  Great food and coffees.  Friendly staff and owners.
4	Competitive pricing and way better than Starbucks. Free wifi. Good relaxing environment.
5	I'm one of those weirdos who does not like hot coffee - and I have to say, they have the BEST iced coffee in town.  Much better than Starbucks, which is much too bitter.  Friendly owners and staff, free wifi, great relaxing atmosphere - try the ham and swiss croissant, it's excellent!
