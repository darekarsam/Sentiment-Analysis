4	Helpful staff, good selection ... there has never been a time that they haven't had something that I needed.  Good selection of gear and apparel too.
5	Great job getting my Yamaha back up and running!
5	Great place to get parts and always fair on the price unlike full retail at the other stores!
2	This is an excellent place to get riding gear and other things like exhaust chest protectors oil,lubricants cleaners etc.There's a lot crammed into this little store more than most off-road shops but the service by the workers at the front is very poor specifically the females at the front. Lewie would do himself a favor if he would hire some experienced folks that are  mature and interested enough to assist customers on the floor with some intelligence about the products and this field in general. Just some advice you need some better signage out front so people know your there. I have been driving by there for years and thought it was some cheesy outfit selling used bikes etc. this really is a great shop minus the help at the front.
4	I have been going to Lewies for some time to get parts and pieces.  I decided to take my wife's Bike in to get it tuned, It turned out it had other major problems. Lewie took the tie to get it fixed right. We did have a small issue, They took longer than expected to get the work done .  This was partially because of the Unknown issue and the amount of other work for other customers the had to do.  Lewie called me and asked how the first weekend ride went after repairs and break in period and that I could bring it back for him to finish tuning it properly.
