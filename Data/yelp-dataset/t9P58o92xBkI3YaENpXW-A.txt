5	No reviews & open 24 hours, 7 days made us very leery to order but gave it a shot. Pleasantly surprised. Crust was excellent...not too thick. Great taste, good cheese & fast delivery.
4	Absolutely delicious pizza. Tons of cheese and loads of sauce. Do not go to some crappy casino Pizza Hut. These guys will deliver to your casino. Only downside is they won't deliver to your room. You'll have to meet them out front.
1	Called them at 9pm on a Friday and they told me they were closed. When you say 24/7 I expect you to be open especially on a Friday night. Pizza could have been great, wouldn't know couldn't get any of it!
1	False advertising. It says on their flier that they deliver 24 hours, but no one answers the phones. Would have liked to try it but i cant order from a place that will not even bother to answer either number on the advertisement.
