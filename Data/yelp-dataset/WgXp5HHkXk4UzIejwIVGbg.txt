1	Keep driving past.  The gas is way over priced and the pumps are slow.
3	I always stop here because it is one of the only places conveniently located in Mountain Island. As far as gas stations go, it's not too bad. I've never used the bathroom so I can't speak to that (usually important for me since I do a lot of road trips) but overall, the folks who work here are nice enough and they keep the snacks and beer cooler well stocked. I also like the location just off of the main road (16) but, because it is on a little side road, it is easy to enter and exit this gas station.
3	The people are fairly friendly, the gas is over priced. The car wash is absolutely terrible, it didn't take one piece of dirt off of my car, and I paid for the rainX wash. Very disappointed.
4	Well lit. Nice folks. Big lot. It can get crowded if you stop while the boaters are taking up all the space. Still, I go here because the traffic pattern works. Easy in easy out.
