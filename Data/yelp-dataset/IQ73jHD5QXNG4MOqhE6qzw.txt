1	I don't like to rant and rave about bad experiences. It is hard to be calm and understanding when it takes 20+ minutes to get your food at a fast food establishment. It is also not comforting when you ask for your money back and the general manager doesn't apologize or ask for a reason why I wanted my money back. I understand it is fast food but a little pride and professionalism goes a long way no matter what your job is.
2	First, this location is a dual KFC/LJS so you don't the full menu and you should count yourself lucky if you don't get food poisoning after eating.  What I got though was some fish that looked good but tasted odd, I can't place what the taste was other possibly some chemical added to the batter.  Hushpuppies and slaw was good, service wasn't bad either but when you got to a fish place (even a fast food fish place) you expect decent food.
