2	A typical tavern with a basic bar menu of burgers, sandwiches, and fried munchies. The deep fried jalapeno pretzel is a great change from the usual fries, or cheese sticks. I usually order the fried fish sandwich, which is a great size, and filling. Service is okay, casual, and prompt. The main dining area away from the bar, is nice, and quiet, full of Pittsburgh sports memorabilia. Not a bad place to look around while waiting for your order. Love their witty signs they put up to get you thinking as you drive down Rt. 88 which seems to be a never ending construction zone.
5	As far as bar food goes, this is as good as it gets. They have your normal selection of bar delicacies, but they never cease to satisfy. I can't say much for all of the food though, because every time I go (and that is often) i get an order of killer fries and 24 zestique wings. They are both an amazing combination, and Castle Tavern's wings are by far the best in Castle Shannon. I would highly recommend this place if you like bar food. And their dining room is seperate from their bar so it is smoke free and quiet. Really a quaint little place. Excellent!
5	Excellent bar food and an extensive menu. If you are in the mood for great bar food look no further. Every thing is delicious qnd the wings are huge and saucy. Love it every time. KILLER FRIES AND ZESTICUE WING FOREVER.
1	Ordered chicken wings. They looked very unappetizing, especially after I picked one up and it had feathers coming out of it. I understand things happen, but the situation was handled very unprofessionally. I'm not sure if our server was embarrassed, but it seemed as though we were avoided after the issue was brought to her attention.
