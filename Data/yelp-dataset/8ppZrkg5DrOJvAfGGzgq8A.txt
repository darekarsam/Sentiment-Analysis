3	LOVE J Crew's style & the way their stores always look their best.  However, (I'm on a roll today with pricing issues! :D ) their prices are WAY too high for what they offer.  I know, I know...it's the QUALITY of the clothing & how it's made, that raises prices.My visit today had the store in all it's spring & summer finest. This location is a pretty good size (much like South Park's store) & features ladies clothing up front & mens in the back. While my boyfriend & I walked through the entire store, not once did the two employees even speak to us. The store was immaculate - everything organized & neat.Ohhhh, to not have to worry about money! I probably could have bought the store out. I guess I can always wish, right?
4	I am a jcrew afacionado. I have to be dead honest here, I NEVER buy anything from jcrew that is not on sale. What I try to do is whenever I catch some good deal at the South Park store, which doesn't happen as often anymore because the prices at j crew seems to keep going up!! But when I do and can't get enough, I come to this northlake location and do a round 2. This store is less staffed than the south park store and gets less traffic. The staff here also seems to be younger and less knowledgeable than the south park location, but hey, i know my j crew, i don't care about having the staff to sugar coat everything for me. I am also a graduate student, so I get extra 15% off (as long as you have some type of student ID they will take it, and even if you forgot your ID card, you can ask for it and see if they'll give it to you). Don't let them fool you on no student discount on sale items, I was fooled a couple times at the south park location!!
