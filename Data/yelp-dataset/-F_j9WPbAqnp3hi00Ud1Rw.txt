5	Th!ey make the best Cafe Mocha's! They also make very good Ice Tea and they have many different kinds of tea to choose from.  All there ingredients are from local business's!
4	I've been ordering chai lattes less and less now because I enjoy a spicy chai mix rather than a sweet one. Plus, a lot of places just carry a popular brand of chai concentrate that's not good.I really dig when people make their own chai mix, and they certainly do! Plus, they carry local milk to use in the lattes, so you know it's going to taste legit. One thing I found interesting was that they judge the steaming temp by feeling the carafe. I'm an extra hot type of girl, so I'd be worried they'd burn themselves on my frivolous needs! But it's nice of them to try at least:)
