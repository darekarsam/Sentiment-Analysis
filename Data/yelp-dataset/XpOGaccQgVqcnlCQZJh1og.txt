5	Glasswork Media, LLC was amazing to work with. They spent time learning my business and helped create the perfect video for the business. They were very flexible with their schedule to meet my needs as a business owner. The video they created for my business has helped spread the world about what I do and how I can help others. If you are looking for a talented crew, Glasswork Media, LLC is the business you want to use.

5	Glassworks Media did an exceptional job during a promotion for my company. The team is very professional and brought great ideas. I would recommend this company to any of my colleagues.
5	Working with Glasswork Media was a great experience. I was blown away with the quality of editing, colorization and graphics created for my music video project. Ideas that I would have never thought of were implemented to make my video more cinematic and impactful. Glasswork Media were professional and timely. My expectations have been exceeded. Couldn't recommend them more!
5	Mike is GREAT! His videography and production skills are absolutely top of the line! If you need a video done, talk to Glasswork, you won't regret it. Many people don't know exactly how much work goes in after the shoot in producing the video. You get what you pay for when it comes to video, and in Glassworks case you are getting an INCREDIBLE value.  No kidding.. I wish I could go beyond 5 stars.
