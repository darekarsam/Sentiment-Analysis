4	Millies Cookies is fat girl heaven. And by fat girl I mean me!Cookies are gifts from above, I'm sure of it. America, as a country, make the world's best cookies. That is a fact from the Encyclopedia of Amy. Unfortunately America is a long way from Edinburgh so it is super hard to find yummy cookies. Fortunately Millies Cookies exists and provides me with all the fatty goodness I need in a variety of flavours. It is best to buy a few, and what I do is nibble around half of each cookie to sample the flavour and then pass them on to my boyfriend. Then I don't feel like a such a fat girl.
