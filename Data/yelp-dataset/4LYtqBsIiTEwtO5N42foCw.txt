1	Gross everything
1	chicken has no flavor and sweet tea smh horrible not sweet at all taste like rust water never again will I come here
2	Their chicken is almost never fresh and when you ask for fresh, the people in the back get attitude. They also try and give you tiny pieces of chicken and pass them as tenders and get annoyed if you mention that to them. Only a few decent employees, the rest are crap. Need to improve food quality
2	KFC's service sucks? Slow? Not new to me.Eating at this kind of place and wondering why this place is still in business. Food was okay, they serve great wings with a cheap price. Won't probably be coming back anytime soon because of the bad things this place has.
2	Lifeless extra crispy wings and what must have been yesterdays leftover thighs and drumsticks in original, served at 10:30am. Its obvious KFC is Yum brand's red headed stepchild these days. . Seriously I've seen high school dissection projects with more appeal than those tortured nephilim inspired drumsticks, does the FDA actually approve this stuff for sale to people?The colonel must be turning over faster than his bastardized legacy products, if you don't want an overprocessed pressed chicken patty between two lifeless bread buns you're in the wrong place, cause the chicken with bones in it isn't what KFC cares about these days. As authentic as that small government party that doesn't want anyone protesting their never ending government enforced cronyism.
