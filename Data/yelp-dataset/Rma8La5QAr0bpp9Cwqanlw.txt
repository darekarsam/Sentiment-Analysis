4	This is a small and quaint mom and pop business. The prices are fair. The quality of service is good. The return time on your items is realistic.  The store also offers alteration services which I have used numerous times. The friendly attitude you get when speaking with the employees lets you know that they care about you and they care about your clothes as well.
1	Rude,rude,rude!!  So many cleaners and alteration shops to go , DONT GO HERE!   The hems of my pants came out after only two wears and they wouldn't redo them with out charging me!!   GO SOMEWHERE ELSE PEOPLE!
3	The Quality Cleaners has provided me a good service. Although their staff were not that good in dealing with me. I appreciate a good quality service from you guys. The clothes were cleaned very well and it was delivered on time.
