5	Great service. Would definitely refer this contractor to others. Very professional and great work. Affordable and very friendly :) only person I will trust with my yard
5	My experience after the first 3 months with Justin is very positive.  He has been punctual, responds quickly to requests and does careful work.  His rates are reasonable.  He leaves our place in a clean and neat condition and carts away all his clippings, etc.Usually he comes with one or two workers and they are efficient careful workers.  I'm happy with their service!
5	The level of professionalism and quality of work is the best!!  Truly the best lawn service I've ever had!  We had another weekly maintenance service that really botched up my yard and Justin came in and not only fixed it but made my lawn even better.
