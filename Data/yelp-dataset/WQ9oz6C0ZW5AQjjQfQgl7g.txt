4	There's nothing not to like about $.85 fountain drinks, especially in the summer.
4	This is one of the better Circle K's in the area, even though it's often very busy.They have a great selection of fountain sodas and slushies and snacks, and has a great location with easy traffic light entrance and exit.The people who work here have always been very friendly and when there's long lines (often) they work heard to clear up the back log.
2	This is the best Circle K in the entirety of the Phoenix Metro area......as long as the (I'm assuming)manager isn't there. The bearded gentleman will either make snarky comments about what you're purchasing, scream at his employees in the middle of the sales floor(seriously dude, you have a back room. and you shouldn't be yelling at fully grown adults. have a conversation with them), yell at you for parking in front of a fuel pump and coming into the store, or a variety of other absolutely horrid things I've seen. I instantly turn around, walk out of the building, and go way out of my way to the QT at Arizona and Germann if I see he's working. The rest of the staff there is awesome. I feel bad for them having to work alongside that guy.
