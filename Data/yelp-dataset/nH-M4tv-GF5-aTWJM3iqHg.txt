1	Haven't eaten BK is a while.It's greasier than I remember (i.e. Chicken fries). I tried the tender grill chicken sandwich - it was falling apart, soggy and not at all tasty.My hubby's burger wasn't that much better.
3	Okay for a quick meal. this place has a kid zone which keeps the noise down in the main restaurant...brilliant !
2	I like BK, but this one was gross!!!
1	Every time I go through the drive thru I get finically raped!! I asked for a whopper jr no tomato heavy mayo and cheese plus an extra slice for .60 extra..also some onion rings...drove home sat down..opened my wrapper and low and behold it was a regular whopper jr and the onion rings were cold. I was pissed so I called to ask them ...WHY...WHY DO U GUYS KEEP JERKING ME OVER. The snotty manager said well bring me your receipt and I will remake it for u. I said listen my family is now sitting down for dinner and I don't feel like driving back to you, she said well call back Monday and speak with the GM. All I could do was take a deep breath and find something in the fridge. I don't want to blame the restaurant..I would rather blame the crew that works this shift. They are horrible irresponsible kids that don't give a damn. I hope Corp sees this and in order to gain me back as a customer I would like my money refunded as well as a few free whopper coupons. I am sick of having to call them 9 out of 10 times to have them correct an order. This is not that complex people..no tomato heavy mayo and extra cheese...is that too much to ask when I am paying for this? It's not like I'm eating here for free.
1	Thee worst BK I have ever been to!!The burger was so over cooked that it tasted like the smell of cow manure!!... I couldn't even dare finish my burger.
