3	Kinda cute mais tres chere!!! oh baby watch your wallet!
4	I love this store!  They carry unique decorative and gift items.  Very pretty store.  They are a bit pricey but they do have sales.  Its great for buying that special unique decorative accent for your home.  I will go there on a day when I feel like treating myself to something pretty for my place, whether it be a candle holder or beautiful decorative dish.    They have everything from beautiful serving dishes to picture frames, pillows etc.  Love this store!
4	What a lovely store! This store is somewhat small but chock full of pretty gift wares and home accents. I'd categorize the merchandise as strongly oriented to ultra-feminine girly girls: delicate and pretty photo frames and plates and soaps and mirrored perfume trays.... You get the idea! Kind of "Laura Ashley"-ish. There are also nice Belvedere greeting cards and pretty, feminine jewelry pieces as well.What struck me most about this store was how lovely the sales staff were: friendly and gentile but not obtrusive or hovering. Just a pleasant experience, shopping here.
