3	I have a fairly 'Americanized' taste buds, so please take this with a grain of salt.  ;)I loved my dinner take out order of Mongolian Beef.  It was very flavorful without being too spicy for me.  The portions are plentiful and I only had a ten minute wait.  I'm assuming that I would have no wait if I had ordered ahead, online, but I didn't know that at the time.  The menu has many different options from bland to hot. Next time, I may have to try the cream cheese filled wontons since they look more like a dessert instead of an appetizer!
2	My son and I had dinner here..  Should have gone to Subway in the same plaza.  Or Panda.  Food is OK here, but I could find 100 places I'd rather eat.
