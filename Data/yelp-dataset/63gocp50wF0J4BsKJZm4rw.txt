4	Blink and you may miss the parking lot entrance! This QT is conveniently located but finding the entrance to the parking lot is easily missed if you don't enter from the  neighboring business's lot.
5	Friendly faces behind the counter. Workers always helpful. Store is always clean.  Has what I am looking for and need a good majority of the time. One drawback: You have to pay attention when driving in order to find this location because you can easily miss the entrance.
4	I like QuikTrip. This location is close to work and home so that is a plus. Can't beat a 32 oz fountain drink for $0.69. Plus they have Coke Zero so that is worth an extra star right there. Sandwiches are pretty good and for $5 for a sandwich chips and a drink that is a good deal. I love their glazed donut holes. So good and just enough in a pack. Nice and clean and friendly staff. You really are in and out quick. Plus it is easy to find and convenient.I will keep coming back here for a snack attack or lunch sometimes.
4	Their debit and credit card machine is down ...and they still have a problem making sweet tea....I love the regular tea but the wife like sweet and it ain't sweet .. but customer service is always amazing
4	As far as gas stations go, you can't go wrong with a Quik Trip. The employees are friendly and the store is always clean. As far as pricing, it's always been competitive. A gas station is a gas station, unless it's a Quik Trip.
5	I love this QT!  I usually don't eat the roller dogs but the spicy chicken are the bomb. The heat then up so hot and they always keep plenty on the rollers.  I guess a guilty pleasure. Outside of that, clean & fast...just the way I need it.
