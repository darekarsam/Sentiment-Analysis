5	Great place to buy fruits and vegetables! This is your typical plateau fruiterie.
4	Very solid fruterie - my new go-to for fruits and vegetables, and dry goods. Good quality, seasonal produce is priced at the higher end of reasonable as you'd expect in the plateau. Decent cheese selection, all staple groceries and dry goods + a fair few ethnic-y and health foods are there. There's also some inexplicable ready-meal type things in the back - little baguette sandwiches and sushi - not appetizing to me, but someone must buy it?Not quite 5-stars though: for one thing, stuff is just way over-packaged. They have individually wrapped all the eggplants in plastic wrap: so unnecessary. and things like brussel sprouts and green beans are divied up onto little styrofoam trays, then saran-wrapped within an inch of their lives. So you don't get portion control on stuff sold by weight AND you're left with a ton of waste for no reason. Secondly, I can't understand why there's no, or very little, organic produce. Third (and like #2, this is in common with similar businesses in the neighborhood) I hate paying that little bit extra for shopping around here.

Everything is very fresh and good quality, so you get what you pay for, I suppose! The fresh produce is the best part of the store, though there is also a nice selection of dry, frozen, and pre-made foods.
5	Unlike other Fruiteries in the city this place ALWAYS has fresh produce. You never run the risk of getting old, moldy stuff. Super fair prices on everything- even pantry stuff. Which I also find isn't common with other Fruiteries. Great little shop! Especially in the summer time when they open the front wall and you shop with a nice breeze coming in :)
5	Fruits and vegetables here are fresh and in good quality. This is one of my go-to places for fruits.
