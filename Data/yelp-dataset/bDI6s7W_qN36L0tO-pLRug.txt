4	Brand new business...family owned, great atmosphere.  The cappuccino and sandwich were excellent!  WI-FI too.
4	Great espresso! They actually pull shots on a real semi-auto espresso machine (unlike starbucks), so it requires skill to make a drink. I was very impressed with my americano.The atmosphere was warm and friendly, and it was a great place to spend a few hours working on my laptop. Bonus is that there is free Wi-fi (ask for the password) but the downfall is there are only two receptacles to plug into. They were kind and accomodating enough to move some furniture for me to access a top-secret hidden plug though.Not sure if they actually roast their own beans (yet). I read an article that they were planning to roast in the future, but not sure if it's happening yet. Either way, above-average coffee in Waterloo Region.
5	Great coffee!  Excellent atmosphere, friendly service. Highly recommended.
5	Great coffee, nice pastries to go with the coffee and nice atmosphere. I love this place on Saturday morning with my girl. She loves the beautiful designs they swirl into her hot chocolate :)
5	Best Cafe Mocha in town and even the small one is big. Delicious Sandwiches, my favorite it is the tuna sandwich. They have sweet treats and many  newspapers and magazines for you relax and enjoy your meal. They also sell coffee beans from around the world. Family owned. Friendly atmosphere. Even my small kids like to eat there. Only cash or debit card.
