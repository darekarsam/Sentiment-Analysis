5	I first used this florist for my wedding and was so pleased with the customer service and the end result that I couldn't imagine going anywhere else.   (I was not a bridezilla but definitely micromanaged.)   And since then I've used them for all of my floral needs.  No matter what the occasion--whether a centerpiece for a birthday party, a Christmas wreath that my young son supervised, or funeral arrangements (which I've sent too many of recently)--everything is innovative and perfect.  This is one place that I feel comfortable telling "Do your thing, just make it fabulous" and they will deliver.   We've been away from Pittsburgh for a year, so this is our "go to"  place.  After every arrangement sent, I receive a number of phone calls complimenting the design.I'm an extremely picky person  so it is very rare for me to give any business 5 stars, but in this case, I definitely will make an exception.
5	Never disappointed with this florist. I have ordered arrangements, plants and gift baskets for all types of occasions and the feedback I receive is always outstanding. Their floral arrangements are very hip and colorful.Their customer service is fantastic. I recently sent an arrangement to a friend who was hospitalized. The arrangement arrived after they were discharged, that did not stop them. They contacted me for instructions and then made the delivery to my friend's home without an additional charge. I am a customer for life.
2	I was very disappointed with my first (and now probably only) experience at Hepatica. I came in to get half a dozen roses and it took almost half an hour, even though I was the only customer in the store. They also threw in greens with large, noticeable bug bites, without mentioning the added cost until they'd already charged me for the flowers. They even mentioned to charge my card twice, which was part of why it took so long.
