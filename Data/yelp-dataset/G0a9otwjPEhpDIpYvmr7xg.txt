5	Super nice staff, great food. My favorite is the French dip N Paul's "chips"
4	I've been stalking this place for about a week now.  I finally found it this afternoon, I got there right before it closed.  Such nice people I passed it and didn't realize it, so the owner came out and flagged me down so I would know where to go, sweet right?   Any who I ordered my food the wait was a few minutes if that, I got it to go.  Got home and it looked very good I ate it, it was a little bland needed some pepper or extra mayo. Other than that it was good, the chips were really good homemade chips. Since I stalked it, I feel it's only right to go back and I will it was good and the people were really sweet, you don't find that too often.
1	Service was par, food was terrible. The food had no flavor at all. Got the chicken salad sandwich with potato salad. Both equally bland and horrible. Didn't even eat 1/4 of it. Even the "homemade" were disappointing.  Wasted $$. Will not try again
5	Had lunch there today - one of our favorite lunch places. Food was great and as always the service was excellent! Paul's chips are the best in town.
