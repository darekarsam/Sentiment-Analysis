1	I walked into this place this morning to try it out. I live directly on the other side of the street from it, so I thought that if it's good, it would be extremely convenient to get coffee here. They have a drive-through window and there was one car at the window when I walked in. The sole employee working didn't see me at first, which wasn't his fault, but he was talking to the drive-through customer for quite awhile before he bothered to check if anyone was at the counter. Once he saw me, he said, "Good morning. I'll be with you in just a minute." He then proceeded to take about five more minutes bringing the other customer samples of what seemed like every drink on the menu and discussing the merits of each one. Given that they expect $3.25 for a small, plain cup of coffee, they should at least try to get you some in a reasonable amount of time. I simply walked out. As it is, I would - literally - not cross the street to go here.

5	I absolutely love this place and love how close it is to my house. They are so friendly and helpful when I have no idea what to order.The only thing I would change are prices, it's a liiiiitle expensive but I go more often than most probably do ;)
5	Great place! Convenient location. Friendly and knowledgable staff. And fantastic coffee!
