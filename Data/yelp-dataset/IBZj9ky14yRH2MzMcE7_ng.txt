2	There's not much to say about this Walgreens... it's a drugstore in the North end of town. Not crazy shady, they do have a security guard on staff during operation hours. The drive-thru pharmacy does take a hella-long time though :/
1	Extremely slow and unprofessional. Been sitting in that line at the drive through for it literally 15 minutes listening to the woman in front of me gossip about her medication and her grandkids. Now that it is my turn at the window I have been sitting here for seven minutes and have yet to even be greeted.  I have literally been parked here for 25 minutes. If I didn't have a broken leg I would go inside. This is horrible
