5	I recently had my golf cart repaired here. It was absolutely amazing the job they did. It came back and almost better than new condition. They seem to have washed my seats. They seem to have washed the under carriage. And all I asked him to do was replace the batteries and fix the mirror. Thank youRich
1	I called them for advice and they were less than helpful and treated me very poorly.All they wanted was for me to leave them alone and he yelled over my description of the problem. I asked a simple battery charging question and the young punk in the service department lied to me and was talking to me as if I was an idiot. I know what I'm talking about because I have had considerable experience with reverse polarity and he told me I was flat out wrong. When I asked him if he had ever done anything like I have he said "No, we just replace it." I don't have the money to keep replacing 130 dollar batteries so I prolong their life with some simple remedies that include charging, discharging and recharging, (or otherwise called "cycling")I wouldn't get these people to WASH my cart never-mind repair it. ANYONE can replace a part with new ones. That battery was 18 months old!!!DON'T USE THESE PEOPLE FOR ANYTHING!!!
