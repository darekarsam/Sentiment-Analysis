3	It's hard not to get drawn in by the Ferry Tap. From the outside, the pub is colourful, with bright hanging baskets and its dominant bold coloured sign and walls. As you go inside, you realise that the interior matches that of the outside in the traditional sense. This is well, a traditional ale pub, with a warm interior which is quite homely. It provides a good selection of local ales and provides a reasonably priced menu, which offers your staple pub food. When I was in there were quite a few tourists, however the bar staff told me that the locals (that every pub has) only come out in the evening when the tourists are few. Also, has a pub quiz each week. The Ferry Tap does a riveting trade with tourists, and I can appreciate how they do this, however this shop could have so much more to offer!
4	A great little town pub. I've been in a couple times on visits to South Queensferry. Comfy surroundings, reasonably priced drinks, and plenty of seating (relative to the size of the place). All well in my book!
