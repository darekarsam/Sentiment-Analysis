5	Not only is this a block from my house, but it is also completely awesome. I have only done breakfast/brunch here so far, but I plan to come back for dinner as soon as I can.A few restaurants have tried and failed here and I am not sure why, as they have all been fantastic, yet empty. Lili Co however is packed every time I walk by. I had the best omelette outside of Paris here and the fresh greens were so tasty. The coffee is amazing as is the service and if you can snag a seat at the bar, you can watch all of the meals unfold and see how much care goes into every step.The menu has something for everyone and draws a crowd of all ages and backgrounds which I really liked. Get here early and get cozy as the place is tiny yet immaculate.
5	Great coffee, creative and excellent menu (hello, octopus club sandwich and vietnamese crepe omelette), comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. Loved it!
5	Finally made it for dinner here and WOW, sooo freaking good. We ordered some small taster plates to share and then a dinner to share as well. We had the: escargot (done perfectly), the salmon tartare (super good, small bits) and the hot & cold fig (OMFG, I could have eaten these ALL night!) Our main that we shared was the sea bass and it was done to perfection. Everything was chased down by a gorgeous bottle of Beaujolais which came highly recommended by our waiter...funny thing is, their entire wine list ranks super high on the wine spectator site, well done!My sidekick had never been to Lili Co and he was blown away and said that he never would have found this place on his own.The chef as it turns out used to cook at my old Vancouver haunt, The Whip, it was also a fantastic place. Lili Co is just all around awesome for brunch or dinner and with an always changing menu, you can be sure to never, ever be bored.
