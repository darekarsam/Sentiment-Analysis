5	I had a 2005 saab and a 2006 BMW tinted by these guys and their workmanship was perfect both times.
5	The service here was great. The guys drove me to the mall so I could walk around there while I waited for my windows to be tinted, and then came to pick me up after they were done.The windows look great, and have a lifetime warranty on them for bubbling and/or peeling! They were quick, nice, professional, and affordable. I would definitely recommend this place!
5	Amazing customer service. Well ran shop and nice honest people working there.
5	Good customer service, got tinting for my car done last weekend. Job well done, fast service - thought it would take 2 hours, but got it done by an hour.
5	These guys are talented pros.  I've seen shops that charge a lot more who cannot compete.  Fast, friendly and great results.  I made an appt & was in and out before I had to blow off a half day's work..!!!  I will be back .....
5	Great job! I took my new car in after the dealer couldn't fit me in. My car was done in a few hours at considerably less than the dealer quoted .Easy for me to recommend to all.
5	Exceptional! I called around 1 to get a quote, got in right before 3 & was on my way out with a nice, perfect tint by 4! Juan is great. And the pricing was far more fair than other quotes I've gotten. Recommend to anyone!
