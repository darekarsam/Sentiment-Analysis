2	An unfriendly staff!My second time visiting this store.  Again they declined to sell my item, a designer jacket new with tags. They have lots of rules about what they will sell. I will not go back.
1	First and Last time I use their service!!  Totally a RIP OFF!!  Auctioned some jewelry through them a couple months back. Told their CSR that I wanted no less than $200 take home for the jewelry and if they couldn't guarantee that, then I would rather keep it.  She said that she would start the bidding there and projected my items would do well in auction.   Well they auctioned it alright.  Started my pieces way below $200.  They sold for $265.   Their fees are 33% AND about $30-40 in "ebay" fees.  (Which they offer no breakdown for.)   Needless to say they took almost half of what the jewelry sold for. Not to mention it took over a month to get my check from them.   I honestly would have made more money had I sold them to a pawn shop.Not worth it.... and definitely not worth the wait.
