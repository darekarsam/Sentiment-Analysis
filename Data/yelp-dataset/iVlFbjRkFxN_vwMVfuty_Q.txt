4	I'm a fan for sure!My friend Ines has been telling me (and telling me, and telling me, and telling me...she's persistent:)) that I have GOT to come to Benson's. And she was completely right. This place rules! So now I'm going to tell you, dear yelp friends...you have GOT to come to Benson's! As a Northwest Vegas homer I've seen too many places I liked in this same strip mall come and go. So for goodness sakes let's get Benson's the business they deserve!! Benson's has reasonably priced and adorable baby goods, cute hats and scarfs, hand carved frames and a surprisingly varied and impressive selection of jewelry. I was smitten like a kitten over several of the spoon rings and had to fight my urge to buy, buy, buy. In the end I just walked out with a dish towel, which we do technically "need". That doesn't mean I won't be back for those spoon rings, though:)
5	Benson's is amazing! You will walk in this store and want to buy everything in it! Not only will you love imagining the creative and unique ways you can decorate your home, but you will want to buy every special person in your life a gift, because Benson's has something for everyone. I bought gifts for my friends and family (birdhouses, decorative measuring spoons, a sign for a toddler's room that says "You wake him, you take him") and ended up buying an initial pendant necklace for myself.They also host classes on painting furniture, since they are experts at refinishing gorgeous furniture (which is also for sale in the store). Benson's is a family owned business and you feel welcome the second you walk in the door. Once you are a familiar customer you will feel like family.
