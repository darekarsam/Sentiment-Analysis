4	Ok, it's an autozone... but seriously this one was pretty good for the service. As soon as we walked in we were greeted, and there was a guy in the back willing to help us as soon as he saw that bewildered look on my, "I don't know what the heck I'm doing" face. He walked over and told the me benefits of each product and the ones that were crap, and not to use. He was patient despite the line forming to ask him for help, and he assisted everyone he could quickly. Wait time at the register was also quick and the lady working was funny and super pleasant even though a customer had just given her a hard time. I would come back for all my "I don't know what this thing a ma bob for my car does..." moments. :)
2	I have had a couple good experiences here, but after going here yesterday I will never return to this location again. I feel like I was ripped off, misinformed, and my time wasted for no reason other than that the employee who rang me up didn't want to put the time in to help me and instead sent someone much less experienced to help.
5	I will say they are very friendly here. And helpful! Anytime I come here I am always greeted immediately. They never mind checking my engine light and suggesting what I can do. Also they have educated me on checking the basics on my car. They are just so nice here I have no complaints.
