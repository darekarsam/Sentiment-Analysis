2	This staffing agency posts a lot of jobs on job websites but after you register with them, the jobs disappear... the office is very clean and the set up is very professional but they have no jobs... I was sent to one interview to meet with this guy who seemed a little weird and all he did was talk about the company and did not ask me many questions.. I have a feeling that Apple One just sent me to a fake interview just to make me think they were actually doing something. Search for you own jobs.. better chance to find something.
1	I stopped by this location about a month ago I met with jolene, I told her what I was looking for and she advised me that they were hiring for zappos at the time and that apple one is more office work and they look for ppl with recent office experience. well if she really would have looked at my resume she would have noticed I have recent office call center experience. she told me to send her my resume in word doc so as soon as I got home I did but like I said its been a month and nothing. I have always found a job myself and I did.
1	The recruiters at this location leave a lot to be desired. They post jobs with a current pay rate and then try to low ball you. I understand that they try to maximize their profits, but at least be realistic!  I would not recommend them for any technical job placements to to handle your job opening recruitment!
