3	Friendly staff, and decent enough selection. Their stuff's kind of pricy, but again, it's good enough. They're not always open when their hours say they are though, you'll pull up and there will just be a little sign in the door that says "will return at 2" or something. They don't mind you just sort of milling around and looking at stuff though, so that's cool
5	They sell Fumi e juice and Fumi's rainbow is my new addiction!! Nice staff and they are helpful!
1	They were closed when I stopped by during business hours, with no note on the door and the open sign still on. I'm not a fan!
5	This little shop in the corner of a desolate district is simply righteous. The selection surpasses that of ANY smoke shop that I've visited in the past several months. Discovered through this very sight, this shop now lies to my claim of favorites. Honestly, an overwhelming selection of ANYTHING a smoker of any kind needs, well adapted service to present it, and the pricing is nothing that will dent your gator skin or minx wallet slash carry bag. The owner, John, is more than knowledgeable about his possessed products and somehow still pertains to a concept of customer service (that of which appears to be dying in these new days). Overall, this diamond of paradise for the wide ranged smoking community is nothing other than a MUST visit. Excellent gear, great pricing, and the well tended care of John makes for a completely content experience for all your smoke or smokeless needs...New home base, CHECK!
