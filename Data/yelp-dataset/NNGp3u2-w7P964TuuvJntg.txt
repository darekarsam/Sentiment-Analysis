1	Bank of America  ah yes the power of Ken Lewis squirming his way out of insider trading while he buys $100++ trash cans for his office and lays people off . Go figure ... screw the little guy. My trouble with B of A started I guess about well maybe 4 months ago . I decided on a Disney vacation and went on their web site ( Disney ) and booked everything with my Visa check card that is supposed to have fraud protection well it seems that the call center that Disney was using for these transactions had a team of scum bags that stole peoples credit card #s . Ok so I normally check my balance about every day or so anyway I checked it must have been 3 days after I booked and I had 3 charges one for nearly $10,000 another for about $12,000 then another for about $25,000 not only that everything that I charged bounced and there where about I guess $400 more dollars .        I called the bank two where used for cars and one for someones cruise  vacation I said wait a minute did it not raise a flag when a $25,000 purchase came threw  when I mostly just use it max of $1000. Well there must have been a "bank error " they said. You damm right there was !!       Anyway the bank did put, the money back except and this is the shi..ty part they said I would have to pay the returned fees from the charges that I made and there was no money ? I said if you had caught those huge transactions it would have not been a problem. Any way we went round and round finally about 2 months later they fixed it then I closed my account I did not want to until this was settled .. Another Bank now Screw you Ken Lewis ...hope you go to jail for shi..ting on little people!!!
1	I hate Bank of America more than anything else in the world.  I am a peaceful person who would rather cut off my left arm than offend anyone or get into a fight.  But, I swear, B of A brings out a side of me that I wish I never had to see, and the unfortunate part is that I usually end up taking it out on the unsuspecting customer service rep on the other end of the phone line.  I have never in my life banked with a company that goes so far out of their way to screw people over and assess unnecessary fees.  I have paid B of A hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees over the last year due to their screwed up system and logic that they will undoubtedly try to convince you is somehow appropriate.  For example, I made a charge to Food Lion using my debit card and my pin number, which means that charge should come through on my account IMMEDIATELY.  Instead, it didn't come out for two days, on the same day as an automatic withdrawal for a student loan payment.  The financial geniuses at this corporate mega-money factory decided that since they waited for two days to take it out, now they would take the debits out from largest to smallest, with no regard for the date and/or method of payment used.  So, in a nutshell, I was charged two, count 'em two, overdraft fees and when I spoke to customer service, they simply read the policy out of their little manual, attempting to explain it to me like I have an IQ of 50 with no offer to make the situation better even when I threatened to close my account.  Bottom line:  they don't care about me, my money, my life, or my circumstances.  All they care about is whether or not I'm stupid enough to continue paying them overdraft fees.  I closed my account and switched to a smaller credit union and I couldn't be happier with my decision.
3	Convenient location... traffic pattern around the location is a downer though!  Way way back in the day, I actually opened my first checking account in this branch so it holds a special place in my heart (or maybe it holds my heart... haven't figured it out yet).Now a days, I mostly use the ATM at this location.  The double ATM drive up lanes are very convenient.... it does suck when you get stuck behind a person that is making 20 different transactions and sits in front of the machine forever... but the option of moving over to another machine is a great one.
1	I didn't not go to this branch specifically but I am writing a review on Bank of America in general not happy with here customer service. When trying to say something they pretty much tell you are even though I have papers in front of me showing when stuff have gone through and they are telling that stuff went through a different way. All I wanted was the fee taken off but they didn't even try they said they couldn't. I acknowledged I was going to go negative no matter what but it should of been a lower amount them what I was charged. Leaning toward leaving Bank of America because of poor service. C
