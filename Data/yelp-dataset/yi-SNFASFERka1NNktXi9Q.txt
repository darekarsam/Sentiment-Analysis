5	Delish Cake Pops!!!! Yummmyyyy!! They cater for events and such in Las Vegas. But if you and bunch of friends are craving some, you can probably order a huge bulk and have it delivered? We got some delivered to the MGM Skylofts. Its not part of MGM, so you'll have to go downstairs to bring them up to you guys. They customize too, so its perfect for someone's bday to share vs cake and cut mess.We got the Oreo ones. Just shared it with the friends that tried it, waiting to see what they're thought about it are too hahaTheir fb page: https://www.facebook.com/cmycakeslv
5	I ordered macaroons (Strawberry chocolate) from here for my son's 1st birthday and it was such a huge hit!! It was absolutely delicious and perfect. They customized it and colored it to match my son's birthday theme! They can make cookies, cakepops, Macaroons and many other goodies you can see on their instagram! I will def order from here again!
5	The best macarons!!! Cindy makes them fresh and to order absolutely love the flavor and they are better than any other macarons I have tasted anywhere!
