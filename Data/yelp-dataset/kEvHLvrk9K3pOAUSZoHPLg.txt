1	I stayed in a 2 bedroom apt. It was spacious especially for the price. However, the neighborhood was insanely crazy. Kids ran around all hours of the night, you heard gunshots from time to time, my car was keyed, kids ran up and down my stairs daily, the kids had no supervision and management continuously lied. I'm glad I got my family out alive. - Hertiage Estates apartment homes.
