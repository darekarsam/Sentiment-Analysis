2	They have absolutely lovely brands here: lingerie, shoes, clothes and hosiery but they get 2 stars because the service was so atrocious. I guess my Jimmy Choo heels and DVF dress were not flashy enough for the sales girls because every sales girl looked down her nose at me and I was followed around like a hawk around every single nook and cranny as if I was about to shoplift or something. I went in there knowing what I wanted to buy, but now I'll be seeing if I can purchase it anywhere else in Montreal besides Lyla.
4	I've avoided Lyla despite their gorgeous lingerie and girly clothes because in the past have been made to feel like a hobo who just wandered in off the street by the snooty sales girls. I don't always get a manicure and blow-dry before going shopping, okay?!But I think that they must be trying a new approach because I gave it another try today and was pleasantly surprised. The sales girl, Anouk, was both hilarious and extremely helpful. Overall, a fun and glamorous experience. I'd be willing to try it again.
5	My favourite shop in Montreal, definitely my go-to shopping destination. My mother and I are regulars there and have been for many years and have never  observed the kind of attitude described in the previous reviews. Fabulous clothes and gorgeous brands!
