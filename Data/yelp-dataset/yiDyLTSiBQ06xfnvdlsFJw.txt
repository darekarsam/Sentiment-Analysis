4	I was in tire hell. Couldn't get two tires for the front of my car.  One phone call to Mark at Advanced and problem solved.  Got what I needed, price was good.  Work was done quickly.  Why only 4 stars?  We did have a small snafu that they corrected promptly and the waiting area leaves something to be desired.
5	This was our first experience here, and we were very pleased. They identified the problem quickly (broken engine mount), fixed it within the quoted estimate, and even reattached a loose rear quarter panel without being asked and without charge.
5	Awesome service.  It was quick and painless.  I went there too get a flat fixed, I had the tire off already.  They fixed it and explained to me about the sensor issue.I've been having.  When I went to pay the bill was 0.  A very good way of getting me to come back.  Mike was the tech, had the tire loaded in my truck before I even got out there.  I asked him about my tread, I was expecting him to tell me asap for a new tire but instead of lying too me to get me to come back right away he told me I have some time, but soon.  Thanks guys.
