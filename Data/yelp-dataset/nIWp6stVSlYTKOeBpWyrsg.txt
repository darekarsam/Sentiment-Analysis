5	EMotors 100% Recommended! Going to a mechanic can be nerve wracking when you feel like you getting ripped off. EMotors is the complete opposite experience. Going to a mechanic you can trust to be honest makes a huge difference. I've taken my 91 corvette and my 08 range rover in and he did the work for cheaper than I expected and the got it done quick! Even after moving out of the area I still come back for all my car work!
5	E Motors is my favorite place to get it my car needs TCL. He offers great quality products and services.  You will not leave his shop unsatisfied.  Highly recommended!  He will take care of you.
5	Great shop. Tim, the owner, was professional and very knowledgable. I would recommend EMotors for any of you automotive needs.

After tax 22 (or 24, can't remember) .99Me: okay. Thank uWorker: yup *CLICK*So rude. Not ever going there
