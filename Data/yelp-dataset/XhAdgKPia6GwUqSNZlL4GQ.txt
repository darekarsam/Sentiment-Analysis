5	Always a great experience.  The staff is friendly and hard working.  The store is one of the cleanest in town.  $5 Foot long sandwiches are great for a inexpensive lunch or dinner.
2	New management new owner or what ever it maybe sucks. Working in the near by strip mall in the Scottsdale Plaza we try to support businesses in the area. Just for a drink refill they want to charge a dollar.Just because we took it back to the office to eat and didn't eat there. Poor attitude. No more supporting  this location and I am sure to tell all the business around this area too.
4	One of the employees is bilingual! It's a subway, they smile at me because my sandwich has basically nothing on it but they're always courteous and even offered me hangover cures because, well, I looked it. We laughed about it.
