4	Lave Auto - Cote St. Luc is a great place to get your car washed.  I go here for all my car detailing needs.You basically drive in and hand over the keys.  A series of people then hand wash and vacuum out your car.  At the end the last guy does the windows and dries the car.The fee for a standard car (like a toyota camry) is $17.  SUV's and Vans are additional charges.  As they take tips, I typically give a $20.  They sell multi-wash coupon books, which will average out to less then $17 per wash.  You also will receive a coupon for a return trip at a discounted price, but they typically expire within a week of your last wash and as such are useless unless you give it to a friend.I'm always pleased with the job they do, and will continue to go back.
1	This is one of the most expensive hand washes in town and by far the worst. Very sloppy, they miss a lot of spots, streaks inside the windshield which you do not notice until night time, always. And they give you attitude when you point them out.I am not writing this as someone who has been there only once, I have been countless times over about 25 years, through several different owners probably too. I still go there sometimes because it's near my house but when I have the time I head to http://www.yelp.ca/biz/lave-auto-st-jacques-montreal
2	Expensive and unworthy. Employers are unfriendly and disrespectful so no tips for them!!The owner gave me the cold shoulder treat me like shit when I complaint about their service.
