5	Allen Sarac's Professional Karate Center s the oldest and best Martial Arts School in the Las Vegas Valley. I have been a student of Master Sarac's since I was 12 years old and most of the accomplishments in my life, I can attribute to the discipline and values that I learned at PKC.Master Sarac and his Black Belt Instructors are axing with students from 3 and 4 year olds all the way up to adult students who all learn an excellent blend of traditional techniques and effective self-defense.PKC is a great family, and you and your family will enjoy being a part of it!
5	My teenage son has been training at Allen Sarac's Professional Karate Centers since 2008.  He has achieved so much more than excellent skills in martial arts.  He has learned the importance of respect, humility, self-discipline, teamwork, and giving back to the community.  He has experienced the success that can be achieved from dedication and hard work.  All of this was done in an encouraging and supportive environment.  My son has developed friendships that will last his lifetime.  I highly recommend Allen Sarac's Professional Karate Centers for any age person.
5	Master Sarac was my karate instructor growing up and he instilled in me discipline, respect, hard work and self confidence.  I owe a lot of my success in life to him. Not to mention I didn't have to worry about bully's in school as no kid wants to test a karate kid. He was so fantastic working with me that now master Sarac is teaching my daughter. It is great seeing her confidence grow and knowing that she too will learn to not only protect herself but valuable life lessons that will make her a better person growing up.  As soon as my son turns 4 he too will began training with master Sarac.  I highly recommend anyone looking for a martial arts school to enroll with Master Sarac.
