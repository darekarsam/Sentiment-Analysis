2	I stopped here for a simple grilled cheese sandwich, asked what cheeses they had available and they said cheddar and swiss. Swiss not being a real cheese, I went for the cheddar, after all, it did say "deli" in the name. I was excited. What I got was a 4" in diameter-- which was perfect, on rye, grilled cheese, with American cheese, also, not a cheese, more like a polymer.Needless to say, that's not what I was told I was getting.
3	If you find yourself at Montreal's Trudeau Airport...you could do worse than Lester's. They have an assortment of pre-made sandwiches along with made to order items like Poutine, and grilled cheese. For airport food it's really not bad and not terribly pricey.
5	Look, this is a deli at the airport!  I mean you're just going to grab a shrink-wrapped sandwich and get on your plane and hope its not going to make you sick okay?  And yet the smoked turkey sandwich I grabbed was possibly the best turkey sandwich I've ever had!  The smoked turkey was truly, truly awesome.  Fresh bread, amazingly good.Oh, and they also have Montreal Smoked Meat vacuum packed and ready to go.  Highly recommended.  By gate C78.
4	For a small little place in an airport, my expectations were fairly low.   I walked away pleasantly surprised.  My wife got a burger, and I got the Montreal smoked meat poutine.  The burger was made to order and was a pretty good sized.  The poutine was also delicious - huge, piping hot and fresh... no complaints at all.  They also have a pretty good drink selection and a wide variety of sandwiches.  The prices are also very reasonable.  Overall, pretty impressive for airport food!
