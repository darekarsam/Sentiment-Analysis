5	This gym is dope! Awesome variety of equipment I've been training with Giovanni and my body fat has gone done 3% in just 3 1/2 weeks!!! I look forward to my workouts. Everyone is very professional and the gym is very clean. Also they have a Great massage therapist! Great deals and very helpful trainers!
5	This place is great - I'm out of shape and started working out here - Giovanni is a great trainer -he knows just how far to push.  I always leave with a great workout.  It was a little intimidating at first, as it's a boxing/personal trainer gym - I am really glad that I took the leap of faith.
5	amazing gym
