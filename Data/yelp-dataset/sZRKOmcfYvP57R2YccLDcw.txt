3	Well what can you really expect from jack in the box? The only this I like about this place is how it looks on the inside other than that my food was poorly prepared with the exception of the my churro bites that are very good and keeps me coming back. The lady at the front was very nice and probably because I'm usually there pretty late.
4	Wanted a breakfast sandwich from Jack this evening and the other JIB locations in the area haven't had the best track record with me, so we decided to try this one. I didn't even know it was there! Doesn't look like much on the outside and the parking lot is kind of awkward. But we had a good meal and the girl at the counter was nice. I had the supreme croissant with curly fries. Also had some of my boyfriend's regular fries and they were really good too. This JIB location didn't disappoint.
1	Husband was there this week,DrPepper nozzle was lying on the floor.  He took nozzle to cashier who immediately came around the counter and put it back on, without any washing, ick.  What else don't they wash...hmm.
