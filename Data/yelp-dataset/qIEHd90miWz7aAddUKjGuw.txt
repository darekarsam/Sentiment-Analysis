5	When I was younger visiting Edinburgh, I would drive my mum and dad CRAZY because I would insist that we go to Daniels for dinner. I wouldn't go anywhere else! Whenever we went I always had a mushroom crepe and ice cream. Seperately, of course. The other day my mum and I decided we would go back, y'know, to see if it had changed. It was better!It is a lot nicer than I remembered - but I suppose a 10year old doesn't really notice the decor. They have a really brilliant bar and really lovely artwork throughout.They describe their menu as a 'Scottish-Franco love affair' - I don't know what that's about but I certainly was having a sordid love affair with the Fish casserole. I nearly died when I saw they still had the mushroom crepe, just as tasty as  I remembered - and I don't even like mushrooms!!I thoroughly recommend Daniel's Bistro. It is in Leith, so not quite the city centre but it makes for a lovely area to walk off the delicious food you've just eaten!
4	I'm by no means a regular customer, but that has more to do with geography than anything else... living 400+ miles away its just not convenient to pop along for a meal. Nonetheless I frequent this lovely little bistro as often as I am able.The menu never disappoints, the service is friendly and pleasently discreet and of course the food is delicious! Slowly but surely I'm working my way through the 'regulars' on the menu and am thoroughly enjoying doing so... portion sizes are just to my liking and the flavours blend perfectly!A consistently strong performer which serves a flavoursome dishes in a warm and friendly atmosphere... with the added bonus of never (in all of my visits) having any problems finding a parking space almost on the doorstep - not something that all that many Edinburgh restaurants can claim!
