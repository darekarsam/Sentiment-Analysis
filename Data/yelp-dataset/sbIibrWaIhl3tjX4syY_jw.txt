4	Usually has what I need in stock, different Sally's always stock different items so make sure to call if you really need something.
5	Was very impressed with the help from the young lady in the store. She was helpful and gave very clear instruction on how to use the product. She quickly helped get all the items together that I would need to do a colour. For the colour, the bowl, brush, processor and advise it was all just over $10! That is a far cry from the salon price for a single colour. Will definitely be back!
