1	This is a VILE place. Avoid at all costs! Wow. Talk about a place that stays open on location alone. I don't know where to begin. -Service: Horrible & rude. There were two of these so called waitresses trolling around, on occasion. No smiling, not friendly, not helpful, and hard to find. The place had 5 tables going on and it took forever to be served.-Food: Quite bland, QUITE! And expensive. 10$ for 2 eggs and sausage. I've rarely seen those prices in far better restaurants. Wet sugar packets.  -Hygiene/Cleanliness: The place is filthy on a whole new level. The bathroom was disgusting beyond explanation. Any owner who let's the bathroom get so dirty probably doesn't care about the kitchen either. Then there was this filthy guy cleaning the terrace with a broom, he broomed the dirty floor & the chairs with the same broom. Gross!!!
1	If I can give a place NEGATIVE STARS, this would be it. This was my "experience" in a nut shell: my boyfriend and I seated ourselves  (no one came to greet us). The waitress snared... Uh I mean smiled (?) when I asked for coffees. 2 eggs and sausage = $10. I found more hair in my plate than I have on my head.... I'm not too sure I should continue this review because it just gets worse and worse. Never again. If you're in the area, avoid this place!!
1	Horrible, horrible, horrible. I could go on about how I got my own condiments and silverware as the waitress was absent the entire meal, how I had to track her down just to get a coffee refill, how the food was barely passable and how they garnished my 5yr old sons crepes with a jalepeno (that I caught seconds before he tried to take a bite) but I should also mention- we were the ONLY table there during all this absenteeism. All that crap I would expect at a super packed resto that didn't pay attention to detail. This resto didn't have another table to focus on and now I see why. No plans to return for a second chance.
