4	Lovely people, always friendly. Prices are quite reasonable. They bake just about everything on premises (except the bagels, which are from Fairmount), and the quality ranges from more than edible (baguette) to delicious (turnovers). A few times, I've seen them take something fresh out of the oven for a customer even if there are four or five perfectly good specimens in the display case. They also sell the day-old stuff on a counter to the side at 50% off, for the cheapskates among us.
5	Great food and atmosphere. Black Forest cake was my favorite. Panini was good too! Will come back next time I'm in mtl for some authentic bagels and deserts
5	I really like this bakery !! The prices are super friendly and the service is excellent - what else to ask for? Such a nice, cozy place that you must try if you live nearby :)
