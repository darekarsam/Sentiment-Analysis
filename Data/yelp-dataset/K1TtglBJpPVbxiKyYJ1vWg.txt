4	Just visited and had a really good experience.  The vet technician (who came from the Chicago and whose name I forgot - sorry!) was fantastic! Very nice and listened to all my concerns (I don't take my cat to the vet much so I wait and lump it all together). The doctor was very nice and very thorough - went down the checklist and checked everything. They got 4 stars instead of 5 because they made me feel a little guilty like I should be doing more. I can't afford everything they recommended and I think they were going above and beyond with the recommendations otherwise, very good experience.
4	With a 7 year old beagle bulldog mix (Jack) in my life, finding the perfect vet is vitally important. I'm glad to have been taking Jack to Dr. Janssen's clinic since 2008. The vet tech that we normally see is Shiloh, who is fantastic, and you can tell she really loves animals. Jack's had to have a couple of operations, and I always feel like he's in great hands when we leave him with her.Dr. Janssen is friendly and thorough, and I definitely trust him -- so important, after all you wouldn't take your kid to a pediatrician you didn't trust, and I don't see that your family's furry addition should be treated any differently! Why not five stars? I do think that Janssen's clinic is a little pricey. Not extravagant, but I'm sure that you could save a buck by going elsewhere. For me, the level of care makes it worth the price. I highly recommend them.
