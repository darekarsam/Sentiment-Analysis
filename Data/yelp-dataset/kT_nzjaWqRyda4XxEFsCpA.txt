5	This place is AWESOME. Selection is huge, Prices are dead on, specials are better - and often different - then other distributors. I stop here about once a week and the staff is SUPER FRIENDLY and helpful! If you don't see what you are looking for, and it is in season, they will go out of their way to find it for you. Thank God I never have to go to South Side Beer ever again!
5	This distributor has a great location (off Carson), great selection, great hours (who else is open to 11?!), and great prices/specials but the most amazing aspect is the staff: they will get you anything you ask for if it's not on the floor, will earnestly ask how you are, offer you free candy, and do it all with a smile.  By far the best distributor in the city
5	This is my go-to for beer in Pittsburgh.  For starters the owner and employees are always exceedingly friendly and helpful.  In addition their beer selection is impressive for the size of the establishment. Black & Gold has boasts a plentiful selection of local and Pennsylvania brews, as well as beer from other brewing hotspots around the country, namely San Diego.  Ballast Point, Mission, Green Flash, Coronado, and Stone just to name a few.  There is always a great seasonal selection as well.  You'd be amazed at how often you can find the rarer beers here.  When another distributor can't sell a high end craft beer it often gets rerouted to here.  Anything special you had in mind that isn't in stock?  Ask mgmt about reserving you a case!
