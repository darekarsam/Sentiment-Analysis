5	Just like all qt, they always have great and fast service. Very clean, New kitchen inside where you can order fresh wraps, pizza and more. I'm glad to see QT holds great standards with their employees.
5	Although my time here was very brief, I have just recieved a fantastic first impression of this place! I stopped here because it was on the way home (quite close actually) and I needed gas. Their prices were lower than I saw at any other gas station driving home from 43rd and Peoria, so that says something. Their lot is very nice and spacious enough for me to easily drive around, and to find a pump. I had my niece and nephew in the car sleeping, so I did not want to wake them up just to go inside and pay for gas. I ran inside, and the cashier could tell that I was in a hurry, so he wasted no time in helping me. I ran back outside, and started pumping the gas, which was my favorite part.At almost every other gas station, the gas pumps very slowly, and I have to wait forever out in the heat. Also, when it is close to the amount that you paid for, it slows down even more, and takes forever just to pump the last 50 cents! When I pumped at this QT, the ten dollars I put in pumped in less than 20 seconds, and didnt slow down at all. I was very impressed! When I got into the car, I could tell that this gas is better than anywhere else, because it filled my tank up higher than 10 dollars filled it up anywhere else! I also noticed from my short trip inside, that they take care of the place very nicely, because it is very clean. This location has impressed me immensely, and I will be back many more times to come!
5	Love going there in the Mornings, Best Staff and Fast Service!
5	Super nice employees here. Great selection of food and nice, healthy options, which sometimes aren't available in a convenience store. Wide selection of snacks. All kinds of variations on coffee. Clean restrooms. I'm a fan!
