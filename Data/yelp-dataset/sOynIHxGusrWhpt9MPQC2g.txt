3	Beautiful decor with lots of candelight that would be perfect for a romantic evening. I was a bit underwhelmed by the food, however. The escargots were tasty but were a bit too saturated in butter for my liking. The traditional fondue that I had was decent but a bit below what I was expecting for Montreal. You can definitely get by ordering the half portion. The full portion was huge! I felt bad leaving so much fondue in the pot but it should be called fondue for two as it is way too much for one person. My friend had the fondue with tomato and herb which was tasty but in a weird way sort of reminded us of pizza. Pizza flavored fondue... odd..but rather tasty. I'd like to give Caprice another try and perhaps sample something other than fondue. Their steaks looked yummy. Also, note that the previous review mentions vegetarian fare. We really could not find any.. other than some salads, and, of course, fondue. :) Service was okay but a bit slow. As there were not many people in the restaurant we actually observed servers dancing with each other to the strange mix of 80s music.
5	Everything about this restaurant is good (decor, service, and food.) I visited this restaurant twice during their lobster festival.The five stars are for the lobster itself. It was nicely cooked and had great spices. Tasty...very tasty.
