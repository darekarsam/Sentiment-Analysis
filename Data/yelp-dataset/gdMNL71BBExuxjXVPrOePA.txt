4	Best tandoori mixed grill this side of the equator brilliant sometimes have to wait a long time for delivery but it's worth the wait.
4	We were visiting Edinburgh and were looking for a night in for a bit of a rest.  This place was down the way from our rental flat and had good reviews on Yelp.  We did some take-away and had the Veg Pakora and a couple of curries.  Big portions and delicious flavors were a winning combination for a night away from fish and chips.
5	Brought up with a huge variety of Asian food, I do find it hard to be content with most of the Asian food I've had in Edinburgh (The boons and banes of being a Malaysian). Strolling down the street one day, with my other favourite kebab stores either out of reach or not open during the time, I made my way into Lanzeez Tandoori! NO REGRETS!!Slightly different from your average Edinburgh kebabs with mayonnaise and garlic sauce, Lanzeez has an Indian authenticity to it, which I enjoy.  The marinade of the kebabs has a herbal tinge coupled with an very aromatic Indian tandoori flavour. If my Indian friends say that the food tastes very Indian, enough said.  Smells great, tastes even better! Very affordable and other than its kebabs, has a wide selection pizzas options, biryani and other Indian/Pakistani type food. I particularly enjoy their maddenly sweet Gulap Jamun as a desert. Since then, I've visited the place a few times and always pleased. While service isn't quick since good food needs time for proper preparation, the people at the place are very cordial. I've always had a nice chat with the staff there (Specifically the lady boss) while waiting.When I am feeling lazy, their delivery option is good too.
