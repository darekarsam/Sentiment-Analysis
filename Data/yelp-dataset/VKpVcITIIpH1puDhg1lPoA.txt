2	*****UPDATE: 01-06-2015*****After The review was posted, Bridgette wanted to work with me and my sister. We got in store credit, and we are very pleased! ;-) ... "we are reviewing our exchange policy"... they said. I hope they do. Original Review:What a cute little store!! I said... Until her nasty customer service came in the picture... So If you want Overprice home decor, and crappy customer service, this is the place. I begged and explained (nothing that I bought was either seasonal or on sale) please let me buy paint, brushes, or let's use the credit $ for the workshop or something, the answer was NO.  I said, maybe you should be a little bit more considerate with your policy on "home decor exchanges) just IN STORE CREDIT, the woman there said "We have a lot of customers, we don't need more" seriously?? You don't need more customers uh? Well, then I'll make sure naive people like me, find this review and save them the hassle.
