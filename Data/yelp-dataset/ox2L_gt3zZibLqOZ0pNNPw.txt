5	Such an awesome doctor.  Patient, takes time to talk and listen.  Wasn't all excited to just jump on my break and crack me, he was careful to keep my body safe. Totally recommend Dr. Halle
1	Worst chiropractor ever!  I had two obvious herniated discs that he missed and I had diagnosed later that week with a much more competent doctor.  Walked into his office and limped out.  After I explained the position he put me in was already painful he continued to crack my back which left me in extreme pain and much worse than when I got on his table.  He only partially reimbursed me and let me limp out of the office.  I was a collegiate gymnast and broke many bones with surgeries  so please don't think I have a low pain tolerance I just want you to be aware of this quack.
5	I've been going here for a while. Dr Halle is very good at what he does. He always makes me feel as if i am family instead of a patient. I have and will refer my friends to go to him.
5	I have been going to Dr. Halle for nearly 10 years, off and on.  He has been patient and kind.  His first concern is my health and safety.  He has worked me through at least one car accident and has made my migraines all but disappear.  I would (and have) recommend Dr. Halle to anyone.
5	Dr. Halle is a GREAT chiropractor! My first visit, nearly a month ago was all about Dr. Halle listening to me and was very clear about not working on me on that first visit. Instead, he listened and educated me on how chiropractic works. My second visit was all about the results and what the findings were and from that day on, a partnership was created. My pain is obsolete (lower back) , and because of the process (multiple visits) I have noticed my right hand has not ached at all. I talk to everybody I know about how Chiropractic care has changed my body and life. I have recommended Dr. Halle for his professionalism and excelent work to friends and family!
