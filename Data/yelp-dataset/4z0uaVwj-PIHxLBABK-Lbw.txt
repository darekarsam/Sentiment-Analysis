3	A really nice place to take dance lessons, I don't think they are as hard-sell as most of the other commercial dance studios.  Their open dances are excellent.  The main dance floor is somewhat narrow but has a really nice surface for dancing.  The studio offers a wide variety of classes, including West Coast Swing, Argentine Tango, Ballroom, and Swing.  Reasonable prices.
