5	Scottsdale Document Solutions is an incredible company to work with!  My company generates a fair amount of print marketing on a monthly basis.  The graphic designers, printers, and all staff are incredibly knowledgeable, responsive, and immensely helpful to my company.  I couldn't give a higher endorsement to anyone else out there, they are seriously amazing!  You will not be disappointed!
5	Scottsdale Document Solutions is incredible.  They are on top of the line for whatever printing needs you may need.  I was on a quick deadline, and sent them an image of was looking for.  I was amazed by the quality, accuracy, and quick turnaround time they provided me.  On top of it, due to my busy schedule Mike (The owner) dropped my project off to my office personally.  Talk about service!  If I ever have any printing needs, there is no one else I would look to use.
5	My experience with Scottsdale Document Solutions was awesome!! I had always heard great things about them, and now I got the chance to finally work with them. For my first project, Mike walked me through various options to consider when printing and he thoroughly understood what I was trying to accomplish. The rest of his team is equally awesome. They're communicative, timely and pay attention to detail. Thanks Guys!!
