4	Short wait.  Television available in news or sport channel. Bring reading material or tablet to pass the time. Mammography technicians were good. Office personnel really nice but a little disorganized. They really try to accommodate patients in.
1	Had an 11am appointment, showed up 15 min early to get the paperwork done at 11.... And I sit and wait for an hour. Why do they think it's okay to make an appointment, yet have you wait an hour? Complete joke
