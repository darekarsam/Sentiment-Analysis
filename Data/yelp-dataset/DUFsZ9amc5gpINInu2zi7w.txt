5	Best stylist I've ever found!  Color, highlights and cut have always been perfect.  Intimate salon, no rushing and great conversations.  Di feels like part of the family.
5	Di is by far the best stylist in the east valley.  My wife gets her hair done here and her hair always looks great!! She is friendly and more like a friend than someone that cuts hair! When you walk in her studio is warm and inviting. She knows her clients well and always offers great conversation!!!   Very happy with what she does for my wife!!! Locally owned and top quality work!!! Great job Di!!!
5	Been going to Di for almost ten years. Takes great care of me and all her clients. Nice salon and great value. Recommend everyone try her at least once.
