5	Josh shot video for me at my speaking events on two consecutive weeks, and I will definitely use him again. He was very professional, thorough, flexible and a delight to work with. I have worked with many videographers in my years of doing seminars and workshops, and found Josh to give the quality of the biggest operators, with the reasonable price and personal service of the smaller firms. He went beyond expectations in delivering what I needed.
5	My organization was in Phoenix  in October 2011 for a conference and we hired Josh to take video/pictures for a promotional video that we wanted to post on our website. None of us had any experience with this type of thing, so we explained to Josh what we were looking for and basically just asked him to do whatever he thought was best. The final product was EXACTLY what we wanted, and we've received such great feedback from our members and our volunteer leadership. Josh was always extremely responsive, very professional, open to our suggestions and ideas, and -- last but not least -- very friendly and fun to work with. We'll contact him again if we're anywhere near Phoenix and need his services. He's wonderful!
