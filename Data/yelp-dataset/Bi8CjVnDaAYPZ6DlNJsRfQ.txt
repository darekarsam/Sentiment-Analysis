5	Great place- very clean and professional.  The owner, "Sugar" is wonderful and does a fantastic job- the best facial and microdermabrasion I've ever had!
5	I bought a Now groupon and was very pleased with my experience, my desert dry skin now feels like a baby's bottom. I will be back! Sugar is kind and makes you feel comfortable, no matter what your skin looks like.
5	I bought a Groupon for a microdermabrasion. Sugar is very attentive to details and gets every centimeter of your face. The facials are customized to your needs.  Unlike most spas I've been to where they walk out of the room while your mask sits, she stays with you in the room the entire time and monitors to make sure everything is going ok.  The regular prices are very reasonable...$60 for microderm with facial. Only wished I had brought a couple more Groupons.  The overall experience was very professional.  I will be going back for my monthly facials.
5	I used a Groupon for a facial and was pleasantly surprised.  My skin looks great, the products smelled wonderful.  Attendant was so helpful and friendly.  I would highly recommend and use again.  I also got my eyebrows threaded, different sensation but my eyebrows have never looked better and no stray hairs or redness. I'm sold.
