5	I used All the Best Catering for a business luncheon and had a great experience!  Cheryl was very friendly and patient with my various questions and accomodated all of my requests.  I'm definitely bookmarking All the Best Catering for all my catering needs in Pittsburgh.
4	People and company make mistakes. The owner personally took responsibility for the mistake and fixed the problem. This shows they care about their customers and value the business!!
5	I was recently married at a venue that listed them as one of their four caterers to choose from. My partner and I did a tasting of their food, thinking we'd try to meet with at least two to three of the vendors, but after tasting the food (and getting zero response from the other caterer we'd outreached to) we decided to go with All the Best and we were both so glad we did. They were the most reasonably priced of all the listed caterers and I have to say,  going with All the Best, we really felt we got a lot of bang for our buck.The food was delicious and plentiful and the service was truly great - they thought of things my partner and I never would have. All of our guests raved about the food. Even though we got the stereotypical "wedding food" it was GOOD wedding food. I highly recommend them for catered events - plus, as a bonus, they own Pittsburgh BBQ company, so we were able to get mini pulled pork sliders as an appetizer, which everyone loved!
