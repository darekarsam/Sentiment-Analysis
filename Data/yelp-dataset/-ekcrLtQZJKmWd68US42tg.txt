5	Clean cuts and a reasonable price. Barber cut me and the homie's hair great and I'm going to be going back. They can cut my Macklemore ass combover, fades, and whole lot more. Location is close to UNLV campus. I'd recommend Fade em all.
3	This place is good enough for an $18 price. I had j clipps. Thats what he called himself.  The place has like 8 barbers so you can probably just walk in and wont have to wait a long time. Overall the guy gave me a good cut but I felt it was over priced. But what makes this convenient for me is that its right across UNLV. If you want a fade, then come here. But if you want something else. You can probably find somewhere cheaper and good quality
5	Finally found a real barber shop. Great cut, chill spot and reasonably priced. Alejandro definitely hooked it up.
5	I've been coming here for 3 years with Alejandro aka "Hando" chopping me up when I'm there. Great spot if you're a UNLV student trying to get a cut since its conveniently placed across the street.Every barber there is a professional and can provide you with whatever kind of cut you need. I do recommend that you get an appointment though before coming since there are days that are busy. Reasonably priced too, highly recommend.
