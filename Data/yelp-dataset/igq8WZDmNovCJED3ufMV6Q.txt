1	Terrible administration. Their two most notable qualities blend together in almost every facet of the student-college relationship, INCOMPETANCY and APATHY.  Every time I dealt with any part of their administration as a student I felt more like a suckered client at a used car dealership after having purchased a lemon.  EXTREMELY UNDERQUALIFIED STAFF, MANY TEACHERS INCLUDED. DOES NOT PREPARE YOU FOR THE REAL WORLD. TREAT YOU LIKE CHILDREN.BEHIND IN ALMOST EVERY ASPECT... Bad WIFI, disgusting washrooms, outdated classrooms...GHETTO NEIGHBORHOOD!!!!! AGGRESSIVE DRUNKS AND DRUG ADDICTS PROMINENT AROUND THE CLOSEST METRO (ATWATER)!!!!! NOT SAFE FOR WOMEN TO ATTEND AT NIGHT!!!If you're considering hiring this business to provide you your "education", think long and hard about it. Do your research and TALK TO THEIR STUDENTS! Just show up and ask any random student what they think about the business they are attending. They delete your posts on Facebook if they don't fit into their PR plans... too many complaints.
2	Lasalle college provides an opportunity for students who can not get into other colleges for various reasons an education. They are not highly regarded by universities, they are extremely disorganized, there is no standard of education, this is clearly a business more than an educational institution. The bottom dollar is what is of importance to this school

1	I am currently attending Lasalle College for the Cooking Professional course in English. Unfortunately, I have to agree with J.S. F., the administration is worse than the Motor Vehicle office and a used car lot, and the counsellor dealing with Loans & Grants emailed me weekly reminding to pay the $400 application fee! They basically made sure that I applied for a Quebec loan before even asking about the program and did not take me for a tour or told me when the next open house was going to be. Once we started, they wanted another $580 for knives and books and when I told them it's not on the website, they told me that I should have known! I haven't found any positive reviews on any other programs at this school, however, the Chef that is teaching us is from France and is very knowledgeable, unfortunately the course is 8 hours a day 7 days a week with the Chef. We don't have any other different Chefs teaching us about business theory or industry standards, so he is fully working beyond himself and it gets tiring. If this wasn't the only English class, which was only 2-9pm available, I would definitely have gone to another school. The static between EMSB and the PQ added to the mix, my suggestion is to look at Toronto.
1	JSF's review is spot on. Lasalle is a private business that shows no care for anything they can't charge you extra for. I would say they embarrass themselves but they would have to care to be embarassed. A few good profs but majority of the staff are shockingly unqualified. Starting a degree here was a huge mistake. My experiences at Dawson and Concordia were great to begin with, now they seem like a distant dream.  To date at Lasalle I was lied to about my program until after I had paid my fees and could no longer withdraw, I've been bullied by a teacher (the administration was advised and took no action on my issue), I've seen teachers stand by and say nothing as make students mocked a woman's right to chose by explaining to the class that a popsicle stick was a perfect abortion tool, I've listened to multiple teachers make sexist, racist and homophobic comments in front of their classes, I've seen the administration fire a teacher two weeks before the end of the semester (makes perfect sense right?), I've seen teachers give students a 60 on a midterm just for writing their own names so that they could continue to constantly tell the class what a great teacher they were. Their beauty and fashion programs are apparently great but the rest of the school is a sad joke.
