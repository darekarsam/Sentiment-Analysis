5	Best dentist ever! I refer all of my friends to Dr. Grams. He's fun, professional, knowledgable and his staff is great.
5	If you are looking for one stop shopping in a dentist then Dr Grams is for you.  Need a crown....done in the same day with his state of the art advanced equipment right in his office.  Have an emergency, Dr Grams is there for you immediately.  I am extremely pleased with the quality of work by Dr Grams and his whole staff.
5	I've been a patient of Dr. Grams since 2010. I was initially seen as an emergency & because of the great care I received it was an easy decision to choose him as my Dentist. I had not been to a Dentist for many years so I was very apprehensive regarding how poor my overall dental health was but Dr. Grams never once made me badly for having neglected my teeth for so long. His words to me were, "no looking back, we are only moving forward to get you back on track at this point". I can't tell you how comforting those words were for the simple fact that I was not made to feel ashamed for my dental neglect. His entire office staff are professional, friendly & always welcoming. Regarding Dr. Grams, there are not enough words to describe how great of a Dentist he is, he is professional, an excellent clinician, always keeping up with the latest technology & most importantly he has one of the most upbeat & caring personalities I have ever encountered. He is truly the best Dentist I have ever had!
5	Dr Gebhart saw me same day, was very comforting after I have received horrible dental care from another dentist not associated with his office.  He and his staff were excellent and I would highly recommend them.
