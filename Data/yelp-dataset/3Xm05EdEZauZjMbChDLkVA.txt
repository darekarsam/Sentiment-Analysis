1	I took my teenage daughter to get her hair trimmed.  She has layers, the "manager" of the salon cut her hair and one side is at least one inch uneven.  This place is only good for toddlers and men who want a buzz cut.  #YouGetWhatYouPayFor
1	Rudeness ruled. We should have taken the hint and left. First, we were told they don't shampoo or style if there are only 2 "stylists" on duty. Then, she made my daughter comb her own hair out. Next, the cut she performed was masculine, straight across the back, no tapering or refinement. And, last, but not least, she left hair all down my daughter's neck, back and clothes. It was NOT crowded, so no excuses for the unprofessionalism.
