3	Elegant and decent selection, but in my opinion a bit overpriced for what you get in terms of furniture.  Would not hesitate to shop here for accessories, accents, artwork, or lighting fixtures but would probably look elsewhere for seating options.
5	Ordered several items from them. There were ups and downs but the owner and the manager Steve really try to make it work out for you. Steve has always been great at following up as well.
1	I ordered a recliner which was to take 8 to 10 weeks.  That was no problem.  However after waiting three months I called to find out where it was and they told usit would be about another two plus months.  We said no - we've waited long enough so we aren't interested and we want a refund.  Then they said they hadmade a mistake and in fact they could deliver in 18 days.  Being uneasy at thispoint we went in and marked the underside of the chair on display with duct tapeso to verify we had not waited all this time for our new chair to be made, now onlyto receive the used one on the floor.  Sure enough they delivered the used chairwhich we declined upon delivery when we had them show us the underside andwe showed them the duct tape which we took a picture of before calling the store.Found the owners to not be forthright as we had to pry the information out of them as to what they had actually done.  We canceled the order and got a refund.
1	I visited the nice-looking store and met with a sales woman who seemed pleasant and helpful. She even came to my house the next day for a complimentary review of my space and the several pieces of furniture that I needed. To make a long story short, she barely made any effort and was so unresponsive, I wound up completely wasting several weeks. What poor service!
