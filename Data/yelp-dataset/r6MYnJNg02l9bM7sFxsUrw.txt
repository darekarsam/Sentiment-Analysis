2	I got a tattoo of Africa on my chest here when I turned 18 to remind me of my many summers spent in Kingston, Jamaica, and I was happy with the result.  However, this place is the Walmart of tattoo parlors.  If you are getting a tattoo without much detail, I would recommend coming here.  But, if you are looking to get any kind of tattoo with an intricate design, I would recommend Immortal Images, because this place accepts anyone as employees.  Nonetheless, all of the employees are friendly, but demented.  The girl who tattoed me claimed to be a vampire and played heavy metal during the entire experience.  Come here for simple work!
2	I got a piercing here when I was 18 - after I had already pierced myself several times. I know, I know - but I'm not a sadist. Anyhow, out of all the piercings I did myself non of them got infected. The one I got done here was infected for months! blech! i guess when you pay $20 for someone to jab some metal into you you should just expect that. Of course, from what I understand this is where you go to get your experience in the tatoo industry and once you've perfected your craft you move on to a more reputable shop. That could be totally bogus but I'm leaning more towards that explanation.
5	My friend wanted to get her first tattoo so I took her to Ink Link. All the employees were very friendly and helped her come up with the perfect design. She got freaked out in the middle of the tattoo session... the tattoo artist comforted her, gave her a soda, and didn't continue until my friend was ready. The tattoo turned out nicely and I would definitely recommend them. Our tattoo artist was a woman who goes by Elmo... ask for her!
