4	A typical Sainsbury's local. Handy, convenient but a lot more expensive than a Sainsbury's superstore.Worth pointing out is this shop does not have a license, so don't depend on it for your carry out.Still, its got great opening hours and you can pick up lightbulbs and toilet roll at 11.00pm
4	This Sainsbury's has a convenient location between Grassmarket and the West End and is the only supermarket around (or so I believe) in this immediate area. It is small but it has all the basics and is great for popping in for all the general things.
3	Very expensive and they sell nothing for vegetarians. All the frozen food is basically stuff that is terrible for your health. I guess you could buy some vegetables and rice and make something that will not put you in an early grave, but otherwise it is for people who do not care about decent food or their health. For example the crisps section is bigger than any other individual section in this entire store. Seriously. And would it kill you to sell some vegi burgers? Oh they make some of their own bread which is nice and open until 11pm, which is a plus.
