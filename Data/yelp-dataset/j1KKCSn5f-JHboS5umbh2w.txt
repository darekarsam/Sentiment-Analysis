5	Very friendly staff, store is clean and well stocked.
1	I found the staff to be rude, disinterested, unhelpful and will never step foot inside there again. I refuse to give a BIG BUSINESS my pet business ever again. I am now a HUGE FAN of SNAZZY DOGS a GREAT!! place I found after taking my pets to this wreck of a crew.
4	For a Petsmart store, this location is usually pretty empty, but that's okay by me. I always get greeted when I walk in and there is always someone to help get me crickets right away! The grooming salon is good but don't use them too much, maybe 2times a year!
2	Going to Petsmart to get my Brussels Griffon groomed is sometime a hit or a total miss. Having never been to this location before, I took a gamble as my preferred Petsmart groomer at Dysart no longer works at that location. They gave me a so-called "salon manager" to handle my dog. It wasn't busy at that time. Usually they'd asked me how short I want him shaved but she didn't. So I thought that she'd got it figured out and have plenty of time to properly groomed him. When I got him back after 2-3 hrs later, he was extremely shaved to a point of bald and there was still some long fur left hanging on the side of his body that I had to trim myself. And she did an awful job on his face too... The only nice thing was that she managed to cut and grind down his nails, and he hates to get them cut. Can't imagine how she did that. Therefore two stars. All in all, getting groomed in Petsmart is a hit or miss depending on the groomer. So hard to find a good groomer who knows how to work with your breed! Petsmart (in general) is still my favorite pet store where everyone seems friendly and love animals (compare to Petco).
