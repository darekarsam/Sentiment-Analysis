2	Doughnuts always seem hard and stale no matter what time of day.  I have also been sold expired milk every time I've been there so now I have to make sure to request unexpired milk when I order.
5	The newest Dunkin Donuts in our area, great location too.  The inside has a lounge atmosphere with a couch and 4 comfy chairs.  The are also 3 booths and tables which make it inviting to sit and linger a while.  Everything seems clean too.  The coffee and donuts are Dunkin and taste the same as at every other Dunkin, which means that they taste great.  Have not had a bad experience here.
1	This location is horrible. In the 3 times that I've visited, they are rude, never thank you for coming and never seem to get my order correct. They're around the corner from my house, but I will not be spending money there again.
