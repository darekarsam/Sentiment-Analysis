5	Get Nuts did a "swap" for me after a car crash.  They saved what parts that they could, and then moved those parts plus all required new parts into a new car "shell" that they painted inside and out.  They added hidden crash bars for protection, chassis rigidity, and strength.They took the time to rewire my engine electronics into a central fuse panel in the center console so that *every* electrical issue could be solved by the driver inside the cockpit, and they installed switches so that I could control every device on the car manually from the driver's seat such as radiator fan, ignition, fuel pump, etc.  Plus they gave the car a push-button starter.Get Nuts moved my battery from the engine bay back into the rear of my hatch, secured inside a metal battery cage.They installed secret Get Nuts parts onto my suspension for unreal steering angle, too!This is a pro-drift shop.  What they produce can only be truly appreciated by competition-ready track drivers.Most need not apply.  If you are at the upper levels of your drift game, however, then this is a "for real" tuner shop that delivers winning cars.  This shop is world class.  It is "as good as it gets" in the drift world.
5	Met them briefly at a Drift event a long time ago. They took the time to bs with us, not all snobby jerks that think they're better than everyone else. Remind me of my all of my friends that are just cool. They do great work! excellent drifters for sure. I plan to take my car to them if I can't figure something out on my own next time. They definitely know what they are doing. shoots!
5	These guys installed my coilover suspension for my E46 for an unreal price.  About 300% lower than all the other shops in Las Vegas.Amazing work, they have a really nice place.Now I want to take my Mercedes there for my new set of suspension.
1	Supposed to be a place where you can go and drift your car, but they do not provide that service.
