4	I'm all about the burrito and so is Tejano! I really enjoyed my first visit hear, I had a vegetarian burrito and Vanessa had  a pulled pork tostada. The ingredients were all fresh and tasty and we were both pleased with our experience here. The menu is simple and the prices are reasonable so I think that this place will do well. Tejano is a great addition to the ever expanding Sud-ouest restaurant scene.
3	The Ultimate Burrito experience! My 1st time  here and many more to come. The Burritos are are delicious and generous. This small little gem in St Henri is brought to you by the same owners as Blackstrap. I was def in my element with the small cozy atomsphere.
5	Searching for good BBQ and Mexican food in Montreal has often proved to be a challenge for those who appreciate authentic and tasty options. After travelling around the Southern United States, and making a yearly voyage to Texas, I can attest to how good Tejano BBQ is. The amazing team behind Blackstrap BBQ, the only authentic slow smoked Texas style BBQ in the city, finally brings delicious burritos to Montreal's  food scene. All of their mission style burritos are great, but special mention has to be given to the brisket, slow smoked from Blackstrap and flavoured with a Mexican twist. You can't go wrong with whatever you order and I have been back several times to check each burrito off my to-do list. The perfect marriage of BBQ and Mexican Burritos, Tejano, which means a Texan of Spanish or Mexican decent, honours its name and heritage.
