4	Wonderfully humble cheap Mexican for the locals.
4	Really tasty, cheap and most definitely moreish. The man who served us was lovely and the service was quick with the end product equally satisfying. I've been past a few times but it's not been open which has been disappointing, as the place is newly opened I put this down to them finding their feet. Nevertheless, I made a mental note of the opening times and went one afternoon as we live round the corner. Can't complain; excellent price, great taste, quick and friendly service, what more can you ask for?! Thank you Taquito!
5	So, I wasn't a big fan of burritos but because my boyfriend is obsessed with them, I suggested we tried out Taquito as I live nearby and I hate Illegal Jack's burritos [no offence to it's lovers, but in my opinion, their burritos taste too bland and cost too much!]. And oh boy I've been hooked since! 3.50 for a burrito, absolute steal! If you live or work nearby, or just want to try a really good burrito, this is a place to go! Please note, it's more of a take-away place, they do offer limited seating though, but Meadows being just few steps away who would want to eat in on a lovely day!I just cannot recommend it enough! Mega friendly staff too! P.S. I have only tried their bbq pulled pork burritos, so not sure about the rest of the selection, but this one is definitely a must-try!!
4	Pretty great little mexican place. The guy working was a bit sloppy (maybe had a big night too), messing up my order - but the food was totally worth it. Cheap, quick and damn tasty! Not a fine dining experience but just what you want after a night out. The simple menu meant ordering quick and painless, but to be honest, not sure the staff could have handled anything much more complex. Only complaint would be the 80p charge for having half and half, thought it was a little cheeky. To sum up: Good food but the price really swung it, definitely will be popping in again when I'm feeling seedy.
