4	It's been quite a while since I reviewed a take away - so its a good job then that Haq's was a pretty interesting subject to write about.Firstly, the food here is amazing - the traditional indian cooking is splendid and I promise you, whatever you choose, you wont be dissapointed. No case of food envy here.The take away service is varied however, sometimes it is a well executed delivery and other times it is so messed up you wonder how Haq's can get away with it. Theres no middle ground with the take away service - its either great or shocking!Over all though, the quality of the food and the fact it is only around a tenner each for a banquet means I actually really rate this place highly.

Since we can't find Chinese to meet our needs we branched out to Indian. The guy who always works the counter is lovely and they offer a student discount, which is decent. They also deliver for free locally and are very cheap, which is fantastic if you are feeling like some good Indian, but low on funds. They have so many curry's to choose from and all spice levels. The curry's are tasty and big portioned, the special rice, or non-normal rice has red and green colored rice, which is weird, but I believe you can get normal white rice. They offer two meal deals, which are less then 17 quid and you can get either veggie or meat. It is certainly an easy take-away option and doesn't disappoint if you want a quick, cheap curry. Not amazing, but for the price it is tasty and you can't really complain.
