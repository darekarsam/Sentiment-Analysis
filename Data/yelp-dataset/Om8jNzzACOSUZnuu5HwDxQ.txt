5	Probably the best pharmacy experience I've ever had. No hassles, very helpful & so efficient & quick! I didn't have my insurance card & I told them I would run out & get it. The person at the desk took my prescriptions, gave me their business card & told me that they would start a profile on me & suggested I called when I had my insurance info & they would immediately process my order. When I called they said they'd be ready in 10 minutes & I'm pretty sure they were done in less than that, because when I got there they were waiting on me, lol. Isn't that nice for a change?! Just in case you do end up waiting, there do have some basic chairs in the pharmacy, but you can also walk to the cafe that's nearby in the same building. Or if you're feeling adventurous you can cross the street and mozy on into the Estrella Hospital gift shop :)
