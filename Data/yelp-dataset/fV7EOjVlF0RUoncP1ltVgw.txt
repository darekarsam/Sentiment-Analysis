5	Great place!! You can sample any of the flavors they have. They have a great selection of mods. Dude helping me out was great. Felt bad I interrupted his game of COD zombies. All in all, not going anywhere else from now on. Highly recommend you go there.
5	Absolutely friendly and knowledgable! I went in knowing very little about vapors. The gentlemen answered every question I had. Yes I also interrupted their COD zombies game (can't say I blame them, I would have joined them if I had the time) but as soon as I came in the game went down and they were very attentive. Will continue going to this store and will be referring my friends here!
3	They have a large variety of tanks and juice at this shop. Impressed with the selection.
5	Its true what everybody says these guys r great got my first dripper mod there he wouldnt let us leave until we were 100% happy duane is awesome i love my drip mod n juice ill definetly be back
4	The prices for juice are hard to beat... but the juices could be better. Some of the flavors are a little off, at least for the testers. They could be improved, and the testers could be cleaned up a little. A lot of them were leaking last time I was in, probably because the tanks are a tight fit where the are placed. I know that they are going through some ownership changes currently... So there's room to improve and clean up. Hope to see more inventory and stock soon. It seems a little empty, still. :)
