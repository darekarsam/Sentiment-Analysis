5	I cannot believe that this is the first review of this diamond in the rough!If you are looking for seriously good authentic Indian food (and I mean REALLY authentic), look no further.The yellow dal and saag were some of the best I've had (in or out of India) , as well as the chicken tikka being flavorful and succulent.  Some of the pakora was a little dry, but it was evident that it had been freshly made, and went very well with the green chutney that is a rarity in most other restaurants.Naan and roti were well made with simple ingredients, no big puffy garlic naan (unless you want to order it that way).  Roti was simple and whole wheat, not tough, great with veg and non veg.All in all, I will definitely be finding excuses to come back to India's Oven for the food and Bollywood videos!
5	Best Indian I've had in a long time.  I've never eaten such good butter chicken.  So delicious.  And great service too. Bring your own wine.
5	This place is great. Best Butter Chicken for the best price ever. With Special Du Midi, you get chicken, rice, salad, and Nan bread for 10$. Try the Tikka Masala or the Chicken Madrasi and you won't regret. People there are very nice and the service is fast.
