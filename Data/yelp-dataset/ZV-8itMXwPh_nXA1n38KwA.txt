4	Nice little place, always go here for cleaning supplies, bathroom items, and other depleting household items as such.  Employees are always nice and helpful.  But I agree with the previous commenter, there seems to always be sketch people around at certain times, but it's not that big of a deal.  Maybe I'm the sketch one, idk...
4	The nicest clerks are always on duty when I stop in.Being a DG, it's basically what would happen if Walmart opened a convenience store in a low-security prison ("Attention shoppers! Your activities ARE being monitored on video!") except that everybody is nice and it's usually possible to find things.If you know what the things you buy usually cost, it is possible to get actual bargains on actual name brands. The snack food selection is where I've done best, but I may just be very, very focused on snack food. As always with dollar stores, check labels: if the cheese-like substance seems too cheap to be cheese, that's probably because it isn't. But I've done find on branded frozen foods on the kind of day when you just want to buy a thing and go home and not deal with a full-sized grocery store. And I got amazing bargains on holiday baking supplies.Be sure to check the close-out bin near the front, as every life needs it's exposure to odd foods bought for 50 cents or less.
