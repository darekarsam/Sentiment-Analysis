4	Braid Veterinary Centre, near the top of Leith Walk, is the first vet I visited in Edinburgh with my cat. My experience here was a good one. I was actually very late for my appointment because I got the wrong address (I used their old one, don't do the same!) but after phoning and explaining they were happy to move it forward and not charge me.The actual vet service was fine. Here my cat had a general check up, vaccinations and a booster and all went fine. By my reckoning it is slightly more expensive than some of the other vets in Edinburgh, but not by much, and the service is probably worth it. Their well organised website gives all the details of location and services. It also has a handy FAQ for questions relating to common pets and vet visits, amongst other tips. All importantly they also have an emergency number for a 24 hour emergency service, details of which can also be found online or at the surgery.
5	When Joey nearly DIED (not at all, just had a tiny allergic reaction) and was in horrendous PAIN (not even a little, i don't even think she noticed) and her face blew up like a massive BALLOON (it was a little swollen) and I was pretty sure she wasn't gonna make it - that part's true...So basically when I was having a nervous breakdown because I thought my favorite person/dog in the world was having a fatal plague-like attack they took care of her and barely laughed at me for being a crazy person. I love the VN who is in on the weekends, and I take Jo and they love her like I love her. Ok, a little less crazy, freaky over-protective mama bear love... but they take good care of her.
