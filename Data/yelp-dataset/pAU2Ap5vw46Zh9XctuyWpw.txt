3	Not a bad place to go if you want cheap and easy pizza. A little bit more cheese and grease than I would usually want, but the price is right.
3	Solid three-star pizza.  I got delivery; took 30 minutes, no extra charge.  A bit greasy and heavy, tons of chewey mozza-cheesefood-type product.  Average crust and toppings.  rational-sounding bilingual phone guy.  Two mediums and drinks for $20.  Exactly what it should be.
4	I live one block from this place. One night I was craving pizza and I wanted to order from a famous chain, but my roommate and her boyfriend wanted to order from there (for pickup). I gave it a go. We ordered a jumbo deluxe. It was huge. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of topping there were. The crust was thick and light. The biggest surprise was the fresh tomatoes on top of the pizza, which were still juicy and not dry. This week, my roommate and I wanted to order a medium deluxe and on the phone, the guy told us that the special was a large for $10 (taxes included). Great bargain! And it is much cheaper that the famous chain nearby.
