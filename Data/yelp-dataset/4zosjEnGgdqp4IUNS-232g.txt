3	When my boyfriend got fed up with me always wandering off with his keys, he decided it was time I got my own set for his flat. He kept insisting that there was plenty of little shops in the area that did key cutting, but me being a smart arse decided to go to Timpson. Jeez I got a shock when the guy was like ''oh that's 15 pound please''. For two keys! Who knew it was that expensive? I thought just as well I wasn't planning on eating tonight. And then my boyfriend gave it the whole I told you so routine so next time I will probably go to the wee guy down the street or Asda who do key cutting dirt cheap.
