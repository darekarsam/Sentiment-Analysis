5	This place is so amazing. I can't believe we waited so long to eat here. This part of henderson was missing a place like this and it is finally here. Everything in the menu is delicious and you will find yourself looking at other peoples food to figure out what you will order next time. Our server Jaclyn was so helpful and always around.
5	Found this place on Yelp. We ordered from the Hawaiian specialties. Just what we were looking for. All with great service and reasonable prices. Will be back for sure.
5	Love this place! The southwestern cobb salad is amazing! So is the huevos rancheros! Our waitress, Manuela, is such a sweetheart! We always ask for her. She is so helpful! Will go back again and again.

The food cake in a timely manner and was really good.Being a vegetarian I am VERY picky. I ordered the sunrise omletAnd the homemade muffin.Hubby HAD Pancakes AND EggsAnd our daughter had the mash potato omlet.We were checked on quite a few times and our server was very friendly and our going.No complaints about food or service.We will go back.VERY surprised for a small non chain restrant.
