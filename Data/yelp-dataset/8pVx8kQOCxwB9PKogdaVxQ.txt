3	Delightful commercial coffee shop.  Close to McGill, pleasantly staffed, good solid cup of coffee or mixed espresso drink.  This second cup is my Go-To place before hitting the campus to visit friends.
2	While the coffee is good, the place is too dirty (they need to clean more, remove plates and old cups, etc., much more quickly).  It's tiny inside, and hard to move around - strange set up.  Also a rookie mistake: iced coffee filled to the top (no room for milk).  Must be better options than this place, but the outside seating is nice (although the rock music was too loud and inappropriate in my view).
3	This Second Cup always seems nearby when I'm really craving something to drink. It's a 24-hour location, right next to Paragraphe. And there's lots of seating--in addition to some seating inside the cafe, there are two additional areas in the building lobby which are cleaned and maintained by the staff. And there's outdoor seating on McGill College in warm weather.The staff, while pleasant, sometimes seem quite frazzled here--even when the cafe is essentially empty. And both times I have been here of late, at least one of their blenders was apparently incapable of actually blending ice--resulting in fruit chillers (incidentally, the best summer drink ever) that were chunky, headache-inducing, and hard to finish. You will get better service and better summer drinks at the Second Cup on Ste-Catherine, but if you want space to hang out, or space to write, or just crave coffee at 3 AM, I imagine that this is the place to get it.
3	Stopped in for coffee and muffins.  Fine coffee shop.  Nothing super specials.
3	The place is clean, with reliable wi-fi. The seats are very cramped, and expect to be back to back against someone most of the time. The service is quick and the coffee is not bad. However this is not a place I would get a second cup!
