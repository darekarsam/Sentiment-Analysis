4	Cute relaxed place with decent paninis and great baklava
2	I'm not impressed with this place. On more than one occasion I've  been served a stale muffin. Every time I bring it back, the server sheepishly admits that, yes, it is yesterday's muffin.Mangia is also overpriced. The fresh salads are good, and priced by weight, but $11 for two tiny slices of chicken breast? Come on. A full lunch here can easily cost you upwards of $20. The chicken curry panini tastes great, but is tiny and there's very little chicken inside and comes to almost $10. You could easily eat  two.To top it off, the owner shamelessly oggles women who come into the cafe, making me even less inclined to go here.
1	My banana bread was stale and I disliked the mocha so much I tossed it.
