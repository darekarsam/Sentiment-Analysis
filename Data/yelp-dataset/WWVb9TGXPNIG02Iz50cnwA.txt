4	The staff at this location is always very friendly. I feel comfortable bringing my animals here. They're also very quick to accommodate appointments. I would recommend them.
5	I am visiting the area and away from my regular vet. I selected the vet clinic that was closest to where I'm located and I had a great experience! The front desk was very helpful and when I went back to see if the vet she did a thorough exam and I had many recommendations for me. once I chose a treatment she was supportive with my decision. When the exam was over I had some additional questions and the vet immediately came back to the room to answer all of my questions. This location is very cost-effective and very friendly.
5	We have been going here and seeing Dr Waltman and his team for a long time. Their care is always amazing and our pets are in good hands!
4	Brought the pooch here for her vaccinations over the weekend.  The only reason the place loses a star is for it being really small.  The parking lot is small as well as is the waiting room.  I don't like how the waiting room is partitioned into 2 small sections and separated by a wall with a fish tank on it.  I have been to another VCA facility (on the East coast) and their waiting area was much more spacious.  Apart from the cramped space the staff are super nice.  Warm, welcoming and patient including the veterinary techs and the veterinarians themselves.  The back area where the pets are seen are a little more spacious though I wouldn't liked to see a sink to wash ones hands though that was found outside in the waiting area.  Not a bad experience!  Will be back with the other pets as I definitely loved the thoroughness, demeanor, and bedside manner of the veterinarians.
