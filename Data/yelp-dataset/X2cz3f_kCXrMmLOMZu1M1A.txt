5	Excellente librairie!
5	Wonderful bookstore for new and second hand, beautiful French collections, graphic novels, well lit and book loving space. As far as I can tell from my tunnel vision magnet walks towards it, there is just a tiny but exceptionally curated English poetry and fiction section - one bookshelf on the back wall - directly in front of you when you walk in the door. Leonard Cohen, Paul Auster, Coetzee, rare Brautigan, poetry and novels that I wanted to scoop off the shelves, shield jealously from other covetous booklovers, and take home to pile up in bed with me. Yesterday I finally narrowed my choice down to two, not cheap but in perfect condition and not expensive either, and the thoughtful owner was willing to wiggle on the price a bit for me when I tested it - I got the impression this might have been difficult in English though. Bonus points to this lovely library for: 1. having a book card, which is like a coffee card but better for you. And 2. coming out to find me on the street when I'd left said book card absent-mindedly behind.
