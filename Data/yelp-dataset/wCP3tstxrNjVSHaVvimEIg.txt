5	I've been coming here since they first opened and I won't go anywhere else! Great chairs, friendly staff and excellent work!!
2	Went with my wife, great new chairs, however another quantity over quality place with an unpleasant owner, my wife would go somewhere else next time.
1	One of the worst spa that I've been to. Slimy gray pus that builds up inside the spa chairs is enough for me to ever come back  Nail clippers are reused without being sanitized on busy days. And poor customer services.
4	Very beautiful salon, decent prices - nothing out of the ordinary. I think the guy I had for my pedi is new/inexperienced. Still nice though. Will probably come back, but request someone else.
1	They were not very friendly or inviting. My nails were not done well & they did not seem to care about the quality of work.
4	I absolutely love this salon! I haven't used all of their services, which is why I wasn't able to go for the full 5 Stars, however I see Kenny regularly for my nails and he is AMAZING!! He truly cares about customer satisfaction and it shows in his work!
