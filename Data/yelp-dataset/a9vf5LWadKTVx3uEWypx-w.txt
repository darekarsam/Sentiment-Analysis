5	The pharmacist was super knowledgable about what is happening in the market place and what is available!!!!
1	Extremely disorganized and unprofessional place!  If you have time to waste this is your place.
5	Definitely a neighborhood pharamcy.  Used to be Tatum Drugs then CVS took over then Guy bought it.  Guy and Ken are wonderful and very helpful, friendly and definitely have that local feel.  Hard to find these days.DEFINITELY would recommend :)
