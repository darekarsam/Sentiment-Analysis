4	The only problem I have with this place is that the sheer number of choices is dazzling.Health nuts simply can't pass this place up. Pure vitamin bombs.
4	The staff at the uptown location make better, richer smoothies than the ones I've had at the King/Uni location. I don't know why that is but the K/U ones we've had have been chalky or "off"-tasting, while the uptown ones are delicious. The staff are pleasant and friendly too, and you never have to wait long in line.
3	All the juices I have tried always tasted good. But after they changed there cup sizes, raised the prices and charged for the booster, I thought it wasnt worth the money especially when your main customers are students on a budget.
5	I went here on Sunday afternoon and the two ladies working  here were EXCELLENT.I bought a snack sized smoothie and a steak wrap and while I was taking my sweet, sweet time deciding on a smoothie, the girl making the smoothies asked if my friend was getting a wrap so she could grill them at the same time.And she was!It was Sunday... I'm glad they had their acts together because my friend and I sure did not.They let my friend substitute regular soy milk for chocolate soy milk and gave us good suggestions when we were asking for certain types of smoothies.The wrap tasted amazing. They have rice in them now which I didn't hate.We also decided on wheat grass shots to detoxify from all the weekend damage we had inflicted on our bodies.They taste like "getting your face shoved in grass while you're playing sports" as my friend so eloquently described.They gave you your choice of juice as a chaser.So cool. This needs to become my Sunday ritual.The girls also let me try a sample of my friend's smoothie which I thought was so sweet!It was a wonderful visit. :)
