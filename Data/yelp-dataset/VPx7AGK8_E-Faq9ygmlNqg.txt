5	Pittsburgh's first cupcake cafe! I was not disappointed at all by the cupcakes here - wonderful fluffy buttercream icing, moist delicious cake. Cute little cafe with tables and banquettes and nice friendly service. I got there right when it opened at 11 a.m. so all of the flavor choices weren't available, but they're open until 12:30 a.m. every day, so I can't wait to make another trip here the next time I'm visiting Pittsburgh!
3	I dunno...  overrrated.  Call me crazy, but the cupcakes were a bit dry.  Give me a Duncan Hines cake mix cupcake any day over these.  But, they were pretty to look at!  :)
3	The shop itself was very modern and very well put together.  A friend and I had the lemon with lemon buttercream and chocolate with chocolate ganache cupcake.  They were ok.  The lemon was better than the chocolate but we both felt that the cake part was a bit dry.  They had plenty of seating area and serve a mean cup of coffee.  I would probably go back in hopes that the next cupcake I choose would knock my socks off!
5	Coco's is truly a unique cafe.  And you know the cupcakes are going to be good when it's in their name.  Personally I had the carrot cake (with butter cream icing, I think?), which I believe is supposed to be one of the richer cupcakes on the menu.  I also had a cup of coffee.  I can honestly say I haven't had a baked good that good in years, and I certainly would not classify myself as a "cupcake person".  I was skeptical, but they won me over on the first visit.  They had a few different varieties of coffee.  I had the darker blend and it was excellent, which is never a given in restaurants (I'm a picky coffee drinker).The staff was pleasant as well, so I really have nothing to complain about.  I look forward to trying another variety of cupcake on my next visit(s).
2	~~Atmosphere~~ Very cute decor and wireless internet! The shop is very inviting... lots of seating and it's never overcrowded. The website is awesome. It's really hard to give such a creative and darling place a low star rating, but I haven't truly  been wowed (yet) by the cupcakes that I've had.Now let's talk cupcakes: The search for America's Next Top Cupcake~~Cupcake Decor~~ The piping is very visually appealing. Pretty. Makes you say ooh and ahh, and ponder over which one you should eat. The use of sprinkles give a nice touch.~~Cake~~ I agree with the other posters, the cake is a bit on the dry side. I don't know if this is because of the open case, or just the recipe, but I was disappointed. I have heard that the red velvet cake is great (but always sold out when I have visited!!). The vanilla cake favor also seemed a bit too understated... ~~Icing/ Frosting~~ Not sweet enough... I had the vanilla-vanilla, which was more like bland-bland. I don't need frosting to taste like twinkie filling (gross), but this frosting could have used a punch in the sweetness department. I tried my friend's vanilla- chocolate, which was a bit better, but not by much.~~Icing/Cake Ratio~~ A lot of icing (on some flavors). Almost enough cake.~~Overall~~ Interesting, but not wow.
2	This is a cute little place, but nothing to rave about.The cupcakes were rather un-inspired and .. well .. "ok".Ironically, the best cupcake we had (and we tried 3) was the Vegan cupcake.  It was moist, and rather good.  It was more of a devil's food type.
5	Best cupcakes in Pittsburgh. The icing isn't sickeningly sweet, so when you finish one you don't feel sick to your stomach, you just want another one. Luckily the $2.50 price tag keeps my stomach in check. Can't wait to go back to Cocos and I always take friends there to see the cute little storefront and indulge in some cupcakes. The only problem is they sell out. :(Recommended: vanilla on vanilla
2	The girl working there was very sweet and informative, but I was let down by the fact that they didn't have the brownie cupcakes which are listed on the website. I decided to try a vanilla cupcake with chocolate ganache nonetheless, but the cake was pretty flavorless (I think it would benefit from a tiny bit of almond extract), I didn't like the texture, and the layer of ganache was too thin. I will confess that I am GENERALLY displeased by cupcakes - I feel that they typically look more attractive than they taste. However, I HAVE met a cupcake or two that hit the spot, and homemade cupcakes are usually awesome, so I will maintain my high standards.
3	As a cupcake connoisseur, I was disappointed. I live part-time in New York, and these cupcakes are just subpar to me, afte rhaving sampled many, many places. Tiny, kinda dry, too expensive.You want good cupcakes in the 'burgh, get yerself to the Oakmont bakery. The cupcakes are more inventive, bigger, and cheaper to boot.
3	We tried two cupcakes last night: the vegan margarita and a chocolate cupcake with chocolate ganache.  Total: $5.00.  The chocolate cupcake was very dry, and the thin layer of ganache didn't help.  Maybe if there was more icing on top, to balance it out, it would have been better.The vegan margarita cupcake was yummy and very moist.  I didn't really taste much of the supposed tequila-lime flavors, outside of the slice of lime on top (cute touch), but it was a good vanilla cupcake.  The icing is sweet enough without being too gritty with sugar.The storefront is cute and decorated well.  It was empty when we went in, but seems like it could accommodate an after-dinner rush easily.  I think it's irritating that the cupcakes in the case aren't labeled, and the clerk didn't seem too happy to tell us which were which.  If it's such an inconvenience to you, make some labels and then I wouldn't have to ask.Overall conclusion: I'm sticking to the vegan cupcakes, despite being a vehement non-vegan, since they seem to be moister.  (I had heard the same thing about Dozen's cupcakes.)  If they started carrying puppy cupcakes, as the other cupcake bakeries I've been to do, it would be the cherry on top of... well, on top of a yummy cupcake.
3	Being a visitor in the city, the first thing I wanted to do was hang out in Shadyside, and of course a part of that was stuffing my face with cupcakes.  Enter CoCo's cupcakes!  Here what I liked:~ The cupcakes!  They were tasty~ The variety...about 10 different cupcakes to choose fromWhat I didn't like:~ Sad space....very bare with no music going...it felt like church!~ No containers!  My "to go" cupcake got smashed.  Don't worry folks, I still ate it!All in all, not a bad cupcake spot.
2	After having the most delicious cupcakes at More in Chicago, CoCo's was a major disappointment.  I had the blueberry pancake and my boyfriend had the chocolate with vanilla frosting, and both were not up to our standards.  The thing that sticks out in my mind the most is that the shell of the cupcake were hard and the cupcakes were dry.  Also the frosting was way to sweet for the bland cupcake.Overall, I need to find a new place for cupcakes.  Which is sad because I was extremely excited to try this place.
4	I ordered CoCo's cupcakes for a friend's b-day via email and phone.The order was delivered ON TIME even though the streets are covered in snow and ice and according to the recipient the chocolate cupcake was good however only one of the vanilla cupcakes were a bit dry.I wanted to mention that the staff took the extra time to make cute cat faces for the order as well.Overall, I had a positive experience with the staff and I totally appreciate their customer service.
3	Pittsburgh's cupcake bakeries have disappointed me. Coco's in itself is a cute little place on Ellsworth which I like to go to when it's nicer outside and walk around the shops and foodie places. Their cupcakes on the other hand were dry (I had vanilla) but my friend had chocolate and liked it a lot better than trying mine. Indianapolis has better cookie places and bakeries than all of the wannabe NYC-cupcake places combined in Pittsburgh.
3	OUT OF BUSINESS!My first experience with Coco's was for a friends birthday.  I had ordered a dozen of the Pink Lemonade and the Mimosa flavored cupcakes (in order to receive cupcakes not on the daily menu you have to at least order 6). I had also had the cupcakes personalized (which they do for free) as well as a blue ribbon on the box and a card as well (you have to pay for the card). From what I understand the cupcakes were extremely DRY but the icing was good. Between his mom, his brother, and his dad. Only his cat enjoyed them. My second experience was one of my own. I had ordered the Red Velvet cupcake and alas... DRY! It seems that certain bakers bake the cupcakes differently...Some days they are moist others they aren't.  Cupcakes I've tasted (* are for how much I enjoy them):Orange Kahlua(moist) -****Vegan Red Velvet(dry)-**Vegan Margarita(slightly moist) -***Mint Chocolate Baileys(slightly moist)****Tiramisu(moist)*****Vegan Chai(moist)*Cinnamon Bun(Dry)****Vanilla Cake w/Chocolate (slightly moist)**Orange w/Chocolate Ganache (Dry)*I think Coco's has everything a cupcake shop needs: decor, friendly staff, FREE wifi. But Coco, change the recipe for crying outloud.
