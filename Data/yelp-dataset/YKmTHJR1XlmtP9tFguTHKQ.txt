4	I've used this facility on a number of occasions (unfortunately for me). They have always been very honest and reliable, going above and beyond what you'd normally expect. They are a top notch facility and have always stood behind their work.On one occasion the mechanic on duty actually drove to our broken down car's location, contacted a tow truck, took my wife to work and then had the car repaired by the time she got off work. I was shocked to see that the entire bill was less than I expected to pay for the tow alone. I will always use this facility for my automotive work.
1	If I could give negative stars I would. I walked in today at 12:24 and it is now 2:26 all I needed was my brakes changed on the front wheels. IM STILL WAITING FOR MY CAR!!!! There is nobody else in here!!! And some guy who came in AFTER ME LEFT BEFORE ME!!!!! Let me reiterate, I AM STILLLLLLLL SITTING HERE!!!! Worst customer service I have ever had to deal with in my life. Eff this place!!!!
5	I called around 2 today to see when I could get in for an oil change. Three hours later I walked in and got it taken care of. The woman at the front desk was very friendly and informative. My experience was a great one, and I will definitely go back. I only waited for 20 minutes before I got my car back. Fast service!
5	I came here for an oil change after reading some of the other reviews. The bathroom is clean, the seating is comfortable, there is a tv and vending sodas. Free wifi and best of all, these guys are fast and affordable.
