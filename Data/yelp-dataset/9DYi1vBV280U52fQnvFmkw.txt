5	The space is so relaxing and quiet. Andy has been doing my nails/toes for years...he is simply the best. The detail is great and the massage is the best!!! Come see Andy or Tanya.
5	Andy has been doing my nails for years now. I would not go anywhere else. I highly recommend this place.
5	Before leaving Vegas for Seattle, I got my nails done by Andy. He's just pleasant and funny. Such a sweetheart. He's great at what he does. I'll definitely come back whenever I am in Vegas. Thank you Andy
5	I visited Las Vegas / Henderson 4 times last year.  Each time, I had a mani-pedi by Andy.  He was highly recommended by my cousin.  Each time, he did a fabulous job.  I love the foot massage and treatment he did on the dry skin on my feet.  He also gave good advice on colors and styles for my nails.  He encouraged me to be a bit more adventuresome.  I was there about 3 days ago.  I've received numerous compliments on my nails from strangers, as well as friends.  I highly recommend him.
