5	Walked into the shop and got a greeting right away . There was a lot of Flash on the walls. Good choices to choose from. There two Artist Tommy & Jeremy. Both Artist had there own books that showed their previous work. Very clean stations. Was clean, sanitized, new needs, new pipes, and disposed the equipment they used properly. I got a very friendly / Great vibe from this shop. They do great quality work, at a very good price.
5	I went into the shop at around 11pm for a Friday the 13th special event. I absolutely love the tattoos that cupcake did for me. I think I may have found a new tattoo home!!
5	Waw. It's amazing how talented an artist can be. I was very hesitant to get my tattoo for the longest time,  it took me years to make that decision. I didn't want to live with something on my body that I'm not crazy about. Tommy was very professional, he showed me how my tattoo is going to look on my arm before he started tattooing, he was very patient with me because I was undecided.  My wife told him that I'm most likely going to back off like always but she was wrong this time. I want to thank Tommy for his amazing work and patience. About the place. ... It's clean,  cozy and comfortable. Customer service was to my tast.The price was not the most expensive nor was the cheapest it was very affordable. I highly recommend this shop.
5	love my new art work I received by their newest apprentice Igor!! He made a great effort to conversate and keep a great atmosphere!! He was professional and kept a clean area!!
