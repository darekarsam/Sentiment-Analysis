4	Fast service.  Very tasty food. Chicken wrap was delicious.  And the sauce was very good.  Nice place to meet and eat.
1	Horrible!  Salad bar is not fresh.  Chicken tastes like took a bath in salt.  For 20$ a person I expect more.  Just plain bad, will never go back.
4	Pleasantly surprised by my visit the other day, the first time I'd been back in many years. Ordered the pound of ribs on their special ribs menu, they were absolutely fall-off-the-bone delicious. I found myself nodding as I ate. Really impressed. The potatoes were also good. Had the salad/soup/fruit bar too, which was mostly good. Enjoyed both soups. Would like to see a bit more finesse in the fruit though. It seems an afterthought. Others in my party had the hot chicken sandwich, which was classically served and good too, as well as the children's macaroni and cheese. The child's menu is an excellent value at $5, INCLUDING the soup/salad/fruit bar. One big concern I have is how fast they get the food out. I know we're not supposed to complain about being served too quickly (??) but as soon as we ordered, the server said she'd give us a few minutes to have soup and salad before placing the order. When I asked how long it would take, she said "it's ready." How's that possible?Anyway, it all tasted very good, and I left very satisfied, having eaten well. I'll be back.
4	I believe they are the best of the rotisserie types of restaurant. The salad bar is a great addition to roasted chicken, good customer service and very reasonable price
