5	100 times better than previous ownership. My wife and I both got sandwiches and beer on a Saturday night and were very impressed.
5	One of my favorite places to dine and to have drinks in town. I'm a beer geek and the tap selection more than meets my needs. The people that work here always bring a smile. The food? Yum yum. Try the steak sandwich. That sandwich has some kind of magic going on. Clam chowder on Friday nights is some of the best in town. These guys own the Free House in Middleton which is also in our top 5 places to dine in town. If you love great beer and food you gotta visit.
4	Fish tacos, great beer selection, nice whiskeys, excellent service, fun fellow patrons.  I had a blast!
5	I used to come here and then avoided the place due to poor service. Recently I decided to give it a try again and Wow!  The Portobello mushroom burger, I'm obsessed with it!  The backend walleye is superb, and the fish fry is outstanding!   I consider these menu items to be the BEST IN MADISON!  And yes,  the service is very good.   Forget the sweet potato fries,  get the regular fries, they are fabulous.
3	Chose this location close to home to celebrate a parents' birthday.  Was pretty excited about it after reading a few Yelp reviews that the new owners had really improved the place...I wasn't that impressed...I really enjoyed the decor/ambiance and the many beers they had on tap.  I think it would be a great place to meet up for an after work drink or to watch an afternoon Badger basketball game.It was not a great place however, for dinner.  We started with chicken nachos for an appetizer.  They took way to long to arrive and when they came, they were cold!  So cold that much of the cheese had not melted!!!The rest of the meal was fine but the the service continued to be pretty slow.  I would say the tortilla chicken soup was the highlight of the meal.  All in all a little disapointing...
