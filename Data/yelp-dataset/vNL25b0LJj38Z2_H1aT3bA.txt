4	I am new to the couscous world but am gallantly picking up speed and trying the different styles of couscous offered from around the world. Montreal so happens to be is a great city in which to do this. The couscous here is Tunisian style. The place is very small, with a maximum of 6 tables, all  2 seater aside from one larger table made for 4 guests. The decor and music seems authentic, and the service although rather slow was very courteous  and kind. Do expect to wait a while for your food, we waited 20 minutes and we were the only guests! But once the food arrived we realized why, it is all hand made and delicious!! The portions are large and two people can eat well for $20!! We stuffed ourselves and had some left overs for the following day. Score! Need a quick lunch? They also sell merguez sandwiches for 3.75!! Stop by and grab  one to go!I will happily return!
