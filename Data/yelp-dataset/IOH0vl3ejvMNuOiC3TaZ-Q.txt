5	Had the pleasure of attending the official launch and then getting a tour of the new facilities in Notman yesterday and it's so exciting to see what's happening with this space. It brings together investors and young start ups into one beautifully renovated expansive building, with shared kitchens, event and demo spaces, lounges with video games, etc. Right now it feels bright white and a little hushed as people just begin to claim the various available corners, drag chairs around and make themselves at home. But you can feel the optimism bubbling even in the empty rooms, like the ground floor restaurant space just waiting to flourish with the right kinds of love. There will be green roofs and shared garden and many many more hackathons and new ideas and encounters to come and I can't wait to see all what happens here at the new Notman!
5	Have participated at Startup Weekend events, pitch nights, information sessions and Founder Fuel events. i have always enjoyed the environment and people at Notman. They did a great job renovating what used to be an abandoned historic home located in the heart of the city. Notman is welcoming and has an "open-door' policy. If you are interested in entrepreneurship, simply drop by and have a look around, or better yet, attend an information session (check out meetup.com for listings).
