3	I've come here of and on over the years. Due to being a 7-11/Slurpee fan!!! This location has no gas station, but offers good service and slot machines, if you want a little gaming. The store is pretty clean and I don't believe they have a public restroom...
2	It's a 7-11. I'll stop here for emergency nachos or a Slurpee, but usually I'll just hit the Redbox outside.I don't like to come here after dark, night shift cashiers are kind of surly and look annoyed to have to wake up from their chair behind the counter to ring me up. Also, they tend to park their junky car right in front of the store- who does that?!Drive another block West to the location at Buffalo for a cleaner store, nicer service, and gas pumps.
3	TLDR: no gas station, ATM available, private parking lot, standard serviceFor some reason, this facility always has customers no matter what time of day. The area is well-lit at night, yet something about it seems sketchy for being west of Rainbow Boulevard. I have to admit: I do use the parking lot as a pass-thru to avoid the red light. But hey, I think saving 30 seconds is worth it. There's nothing especially special about this location. It's a convenient place for ATM access or a quick energy drink. I would avoid the slurpees, even though it's always a tempting option. I've never visited during the day, but the night shift isn't any more exciting, I'm sure. They probably have a harder job anyway in terms of re-stocking, night-crawlers, and recovery. My expectations aren't that high anyway: a friendly greeting (as required by their loss prevention), a smile, and an appreciation for my purchase. You'll get that at this location or at least 2 out of 3.
