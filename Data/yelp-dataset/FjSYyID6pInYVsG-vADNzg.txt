1	Just witnessed a most sexist and unfair firing of a waitress in front of other customers. The owner was rude to other customers who tried to come to her aid. He said he lost a regular because she brought him the wrong tea. He lost a lot more regulars because of his public display of anger.
5	My favorite Breakfast and Lunch place in Charlotte where the food is downhome country cooking with a very friendly and helpfull staff.
5	Good food, simple decor and good service. Old style Greek restaurant in the Charlotte tradition.
