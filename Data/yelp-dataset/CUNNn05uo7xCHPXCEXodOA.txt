4	Very knowledgeable staff and friendly.
5	This Gamestop is in Desert Ridge and has friendly service and a good selection of new and used games.  Gamestop in general is great because they will buy back your old games.  I like that :)!!
5	Charlene should do a workshop for every other game trading establishment around the valley. She was excellent. All by herself in a busy store helping everyone in the with above average customer service. Everyone in the store left with a smile. Charlene really knows her stuff you can tell she loves her job. I will never go to play n trade again.
3	They let me bring my puppy in while I shop.  Two thumbs up for that.
