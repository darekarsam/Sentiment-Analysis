4	Funky in a good way underground cafe right on St. Catherine.  Blink and you'll miss the staircase- so pay attention because it's a place to remember!The most extensive menu of unique food and drink- rad place to come in the freezing cold wintertime.
4	The second time I've been here, and thankfully I've never been disappointed.  It's right on St. Catherine street and it's underground.  They have great beer on tap, and some decent burgers.  Seem to have live music at nights (I've been there during the day, so I cant vouch for that statement).  The last time I had come here, I tried some of their Sangria which was absolutely delicious.  Didn't have it this time, though.
