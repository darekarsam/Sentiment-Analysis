4	Tried the siu mai and bubble tea from here.  The siu mai was very good and each one was probably double normal size with a nice big shrimp on top. It seemed to using more meat than fat, which is not so common these days.  I also had the lychee bubble tea.   While there wasn't much lychee flavour, it had less ice than normal plus a strong tea flavour.  I actually quite enjoyed it. I would call it a blend of HK style tea (served cold) with tapioca and lychee. It was quite good (and popular as there was a lineup of 10 people when we arrived).Overall, if you are into food trucks, I recommend you check these guys out.
5	As someone who loves Dim Sum I was excited when I came across the food truck at a random street fair. Paid $4.50 for a couple bites of coleslaw salad and two dumplings. Although I wish it had been a slightly larger serving, I have to say that their dumplings are SPOT ON. Perfect portions and just so darn delicious.
5	Definitely worth the priceOne of the most Reasonable priced truck with delicious food.Tried their best seller, their shrimp and pork dumplings and it was incredible.Looked more like 2 gigantic meatballs but amazing food for priceHighly recommended for next season
2	its a dim sum mobile, how awesome is that? apparently, they forgot the awesome part of a dim sum mobile.its quite underwhelming. in terms of taste, its pretty bland for what you're paying and you only get one for each hand (so 2). thank god, its only 2 but at the same, i'm still quite hungry after this.it needs some love from the old lady pushing the cart!
