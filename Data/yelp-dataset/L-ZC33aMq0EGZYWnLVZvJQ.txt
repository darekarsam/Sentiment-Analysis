5	Recently had my car tinted here and I am very happy.  The staff was friendly and professional.  They even have a comfortable waiting lounge with water and soda while you wait for your car.  They are open on weekends and seem carry a pretty wide variety of film.  Prices were good and the quality of the tint job seems very good.  Would use this place again in the future!
5	Great service and they are now actually part of Mike's Sunstoppers. Leah is a wonderful customer service rep and sells you tint that you need and doesn't try to force you into the more expensive brands. And they do Chevy & Lexus dealership tint, so I think they are pretty legitimate.
5	Nice customer service. Good product.
