4	I've dealt w/ a variety of Leslie's pool locations here in the valley. If you dealing w/ Leslie's pool products/services this is the store! Customer service is their motto. They are quick, comprehensive and knowlegible of their products and service. They know pools inside out. Patrick and his staff will go out of their way to meet your needs. Doesn't matter what your needs are large or small you will get same great service.
5	No Wonder these guys have such high ratings. These guys are awesome when it comes to knowing their stuff and helping you out with some information on discounts and ways to save. My bf and I were in the store the other day and it was the cashier and another customer. We came and got some information on what else to do to our pool to keep the alkalinity/ph etc all balanced. But what we really got was..... information about a 50 rebate through SNWA that you can apply to a solar pool cover. Also... through May 11, there is 15% off the solar covers in the store and additionally...... they have military discount. Total, my solar cover will be about 65.00 - SCHWEET!!We visit these stores all over the area in our shopping adventures but this one and the Southern Highlands one are the ones we frequent most as they are the most helpful and haven't steered us wrong yet.
