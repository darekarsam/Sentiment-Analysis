3	This Ace location is just A-OK.It's bigger than the one on Willy Street, has a better selection, but the mom 'n pop feel you get from Willy Street is missing here. The customer service is lacking, but I'll take a so-so Ace over Home Depot any day.
4	I like the selection of stuff here, it's kind of funky. It's in step with their proximity to the Sundance Theater. Baggalini purses and some cool umbrellas stand out in my mind. I thought the people working here were very friendly. They tested some batteries for me and lent me a tool to adjust something on my car. The prices seemed to be the same as some things I've seen at BB&B. They close at 5pm on Sat & Sun, which you have to plan for...
4	Good store, good service. I'm a bit biased since I live right around the corner, but I still think its a great shop. Very mom n'pop esque, with shelves shoved full of everything you can imagine-- would be very difficult to navigate were it not for the helpful staff who can show you around. Selection isnt quite home depot sized in terms of the multiplicity of brands of the same item, but you can typically find what you need. Hours are good too-- I find myself in the middle of a motorcycle project needing something urgently fairly often and can always find it here.
2	This is a convenient location, but it feels like every time we try to use the coupons or rewards we have earned through ace, this location won't let us use them because they mark most things on "sale" - sometimes they just say "sale" but are not actually any less than the original price, but this still voids any possible use of a coupon. Or things are marked down $1 or $2 tops. It's really a bunch of bologna. And we just witnessed them close early on a Saturday (4 min until closing) and turn a bunch of customers away. Really strange.Hey, ace, we go to you for the customer service. If you all don't quit this weird price trickery, we can take our business to one of the less expensive big box stores.
