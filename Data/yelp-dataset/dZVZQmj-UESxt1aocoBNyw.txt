3	The Party Port is the kind of place you want to go when you want booze, but you don't want to look like an ass trying to buy kegs of miller lite from Barriques Wine Cave.Plus it's named after a port where people party.  Awesome!
4	If you can get there, go there-- cheaper than most places.
4	I've become a semi-regular (as regular as a light drinker gets, anyway) here, since it's so close to work and right on my drive home. I really love the great beer selection, and the cheerful and knowledgeable staff. I arrive tired and dragging from the work day and always leave either laughing or at least with a smile on my face, usually with something new and interesting to try. The prices are reasonable too.
