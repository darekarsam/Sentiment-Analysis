5	Best coffee in Edinburgh, without the shadow of a doubt!Friendly staff, yummy scones (and real clotted cream!), ab-so-lu-tely to-die-for Chai Latte (not the oversweet kind you get in Starbucks), great coffee too!I love the dinky tiny little shop although its often hard to get a seat at busy times.Definitely recommend!
