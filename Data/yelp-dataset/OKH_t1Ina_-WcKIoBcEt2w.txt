5	I stopped in to this brand new business last week. They sell a full selection of Cerreta's candies, including each variety of caramel. The staff was friendly and inviting, pressing me to have a free sample of the sea salt chocolate caramel. Oh yum, So good!You can buy the candy there by the pound, and they also offer parties where you can make your own chocolate pizza, similar to what you can do at the Cerreta's factory in Glendale. It's a lovely little shop, and I'm glad they're in the neighborhood!
2	Ice cream run of the mill.  Chocolates especially the creme tasted quite rancid.  Expensive disappointment.
5	Great little spot with outstanding service! Went for a child's birthday party and had a great time. The staff had several activities planned and kept a great pace for the range of ages in the group. My daughter loved it! Great spot! I wish they hosted adult parties! We will be back and recommend others check it out too! Very reasonable prices for the popcorn, ice cream, and candy comparing to others. Nice  ambiance too!
