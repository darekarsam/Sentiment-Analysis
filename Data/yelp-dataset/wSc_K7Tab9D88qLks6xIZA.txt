5	So I decided to treat myself and had Daryl's Detail on Wheels detail my 2003 Toyota Camry.  They are mobile and came to my house.  I thought it was a great value for what I got.  He spent a couple of hours on my car and it was less than 50 bucks.  Washed, waxed, tire treatments, and cleaned, vacuumed, and wiped the inside as well.  This was well worth it.  The car hasn't looked better in years.  Thanks for a great job and I'll be using you guys again for sure!
5	I hired Daryl for full detail of my Tesla and he did an incredible job.  He worked around my schedule, coming to my house at 8 a.m.  He really took his time (I've had other detail shops rush the work and do a sloppy job) and he covered everything with excellent care and detail.  He also did all of the waxing by hand which avoids any swirl marks that mechanized buffers can sometimes cause.  All in all, I was extremely pleased and will definitely use Daryl from here on out for all of my detailing needs.  Great price and great service!
5	Just got my car cleaned inside by Daryl and man it needed some love. I had my other car cleaned by him and was impress how important it was to him to leave my car in such great care that he did not mind spending as much time as it needed. He great with his knowledge of products and how to care for your car that really is easy to do. He a all around great person and I will use him again for my outside cleaning. If you are not sure about if he good for you, just call him and one minute on the phone you will hear the nicest voice that could be your car life saver.
