4	Oh dear. I'm in love with bojangles. That is one really tasty biscuit. I've only been to 2 other bojangles near south park and this one is def tons better than that one.  They put chunks of beef in the gravy for mash potatoes AND in their dirty rice! Chicken is great, not as amazing as Price's but I come here for lunch a lot. Did i mention how much i love their biscuits!?
3	This location is between Tryon and South Blvd on Woodlawn. The location isn't the best... it's somwhat inconvient with all of the traffic. Service- Only had the pleasure of the drive- through but thought that the staff was friendly enough. Chicken was hot and yummy!
5	I'm pretty sure fast food doesn't get better than this.  And when every thing on the menu starts with 'famous', at ANY OTHER restaurant, you should question it.  But not here.  Their famous sweet tea rocks;  their famous sweet potato pie rocks; their famous chicken and biscuits rocks.  I almost brought some to come with me on the plane.
5	Friendly service. Famous Bojangles chicken. I always look forward to stopping by here when we have long enough layover in this area. Two more days here means two more times I get to stop by.
2	Oh boy...do I love some Bojangles!I'm not going to waste your time saying all the great things about the food at Bojangles that have already been said.A smile and a friendly voice could improve things here.
