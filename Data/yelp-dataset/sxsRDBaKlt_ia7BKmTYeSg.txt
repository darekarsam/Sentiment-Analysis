5	Had a great experience with Dr. Jaben. Eyesight is 20/15.
2	I was very displeased with the consultation here.The receptionist surprisingly ended up also being my "technician" and I never once saw a doctor. I left the appointment not knowing whether I was truly a candidate for the surgery or not, because she was not clear in her consultation at all. I think that's what the doctor is for.The office to me felt like a ghost town...but who knows how many clients they have. I was very unhappy with the overall morale of the consultation and would not recommend this place to anyone I know.Maybe they are pretty good, but my experience can't vouch for them.
5	Great customer service. Very caring team. Felt 100% at ease. TLC really has the patients best interest at heart.
