2	I hate myself for reviewing Dominos, but I have to give props to this location for their awesome service and incredible speed. A++++ service - friendly, helpful, and enjoyable.  Definitely not what you'd expect from a carryout chain pizza place.The "all new" pizza that the commercials boast about tastes exactly like the "old" pizza to me.  Perhaps there's a bit more garlic flavor to the crust, but otherwise seems to be the same 'ole Dominos pie.Pricey, too. A 14" Brooklyn with 3 toppings and a pair of chocolate lava cakes was $25. Ouch!!! Same deal from Papa Johns would've cost $15.I usually eat Dominos pizza about once every 2 years. Even with the "all new" pizza, I don't think I'll be sampling with any more frequency.Summary:Service = 5 stars (awesome folks working here, seriously!)Food = 2 stars (despite being "all new" it still tastes the same to me)Value = 1 stars (extremely pricey for take-out pizza)Misc = 5 stars (online ordering is the best system ever)

2	Yes, it's the place where we stop for pizza for convenience -- it's on our way home from work, it's cheap, it's simple. Do they always get our orders right? No. Do some of the staff there need a lesson or two in customer service? Absolutely. Am I going to stop going there as a result? No, it's too convenient. So, if you're looking for a notch above a frozen pizza, go for it. If you're looking for a cheap alternative to the newly closed Little Caesars, definitely give it a try. If you're looking for your order to be perfect, or gourmet, or a friendly experience, I'd go elsewhere.Can't beat the 2 medium sized 2-topping pizzas for $5.99 though.
