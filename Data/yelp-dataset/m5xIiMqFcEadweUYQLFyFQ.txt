5	It's Jimmy John's! If you been to one you've been to them all.  Doesn't mean it isn't still good. Brand new location, but the sandwiches still taste good. And that bread! Oh that damn bread! This location seems a bit smaller than some of the other ones. There doesn't seem to be as much seating. And some of the seating they do have seems to be real close together. But that's nitpicking. I come for the sandwiches and they're good like always. If it ain't broke don't fix it.
5	Fast amazing subs, and great customer service. Finally a Jimmy Johns that is close to me!!!
5	We live live right down the street, and get delivery often! They are "freakishly fast" always under 10 mins! The staff is amazing, because our sandwiches are always prefect!
5	Yummy Sandwiches...and it is so much fun jumping in the car with our bag of sandwiches from JJ's and having my hubby say: "That really was FREAKY fast."  Every.single.time!
