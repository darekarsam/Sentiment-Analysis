4	You have to try the chuck Norris
4	Close to the office so we always go there for after-work drinks.Very good pizza. I you like meat, try the Chuck Norris
4	Don't bother looking at the menu - Order the Chuck Norris and be prepared for a great pizza
4	I like this restaurant a lot! Generally on Nun's Island there are not a lot of good restaurants at all. But Chez Carl is really good and worthwhile to go to.They have specialty pizza and are child friendly. There is a private parking lot so you don't need to search forever for a spot!I would not recommend ordering it for delivery though, the pizza doesn't taste good, perhaps doesn't last during the delivery period. Its really great when you go there and experience it yourself.PS - the bathrooms are clean and its child friendly!
4	Local favorite here on Nuns Island for Lunch and Dinner or just a drink after work.Great selection of pizzas (their specialty) but also many other things.Really great outdoor terrace for summer times :) Favorite Pizza: The Chez Carl
3	I love the pizza of Chez Carl. The crust is perfect. Chuck Norris is a must try and the classics of pizza are as good as one can experience in the Italian pizza restaurants in Little Italy.  During the summer the outdoor patio is a wonderful place to be. One downside, when it is busy the service is really slow and the waiting time for food is more then an hour. Don't go on Friday night particularly during the summer! 8pm during week days works much more better.
5	Had a dinner there with my family. I ordered a burger and a pepperoni pizza to share with my wife. We really liked both. The burgers were big, nice and juicy. The pizza was really great, on tasty thin crust.We'll definitely dine there again!
