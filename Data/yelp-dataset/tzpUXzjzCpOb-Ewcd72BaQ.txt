3	Booze! In North Carolina, spirits are sold at officially licensed state-run shops and this is the one for south Charlotte. Because there is no competition in the marketplace, you can expect standardized prices with few specials or deals. The folks behind the counter are okay, but they're far from the expert that you might want if you were looking for knowledge.But the store is clean and it's well stocked and it has most everything.
4	Picked up a bottle of wine before heading to a nearby hotel.  State run store, being from NY, it's the same prices I usually pay.  Friendly people.
4	The staff is always very helpful and really quick... Even if there's a line, it moves swiftly... The prices are what you'd expect, so there are no surprises there... One of the cooler things about this place is they have a table set up right when you walk in where they put things that are either being discontinued or no longer carried by the store...  The parking lot is almost always crazy if you go on a Friday or holiday weekend...  Make sure you go in through the back way and park on the side of the store instead of the front... It'll save you all sorts of headaches...
