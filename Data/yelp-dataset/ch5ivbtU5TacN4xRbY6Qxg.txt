5	Such a great selection. First floor: the regular wines available all year long. Second floor: the speciality wines and those available in small quantities.Don't be intimidated by the second floor. They do have very expensive wines but they have a lot of bottles below 20$. The staff is very helpful. Ask them anything and they will find the right wine for you.
4	The name says it all: SelectionAmazing variety on 2 1/2 floors from all over the place.Does not stand a chance compared to the Rockland Location, but second best is still very good.2 Parking Lots Nearby and a pretty nice building and layout inside.A must for my wine fix.
