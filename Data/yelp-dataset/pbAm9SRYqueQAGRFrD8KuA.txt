5	I have had my yard maintained by Bim's team for almost 2 years and they do an amazing job. I also use Josh and his team to take care of our pool including the installation of our heat pump so we can use the pool year around.Is great to have a single point of contact for anything related to the yard or pool.I highly recommend Bim's for lawn maintenance and pool service.
5	Very responsive and reliable. Thank you to Bim & his crew!

1	RUDE EMPLOYEES! I was pulling out of a gas station when a Bims truck marked D33112 pulled up to the center of the gas station blocking my exit. the guy could see I was on my way leaving but he just looked at me and got out of his truck. I went inside asking him to move and he said "after I take care of this" which he was filling a soda.. after he finally left the gas station he looked at me and pointed in the opposite direction as if I was going to back out when I was already on my way out when he blocked me! I wouldn't use this company ever or refer them to anyone because a rude employee is most likely an underpaid employee. That guy needs to be fired! direct violation of uniform fire code 1213. it's a life safety issue and it seems your employees need to be trained.
