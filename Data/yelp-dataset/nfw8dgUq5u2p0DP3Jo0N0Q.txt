2	I've had better. The food is never great and the service can be slow. It shouldn't be a struggle to get a glass of water, but I'm 2 for 2 here.
1	I only go here when I'm in the area because it's the only brunch place that doesn't have a line up on a Saturday morning... Maybe it's a sign? The service is horrible and extremely slow. It usually takes 20 minutes go get a cup of coffee. The potatoes are tasteless, the eggs Benedict are super runny, the coffee tastes like dirty water... And the list goes on and on. I've given this place a chance, twice, and it just gets worse. If you're able to get in and out of this place with the RIGHT order and under 3 hours, it's a miracle.
1	Have to pay extra for fruit.  The apple sauce they provide  with traditional eggs and bacon plate Is  a good option only for a three year old. Nothing sets it apart from other breakfast places, no effort or creativity in presentation of food.
1	Terrible! Service is bad, they forget to bring some of your stuff even when there's only 5 active tables. Waitresses seem out of it as if they were high and take an eternity to complete seemingly simple tasks. As for the food, it's mediocre to say the least. Not worth the price you pay..
1	Nothing special about this place. The food is average, slow service and not crazy about having to pay extra for fruitsNot crazy about the apple sauce you get with the eggs and the coffee was not very good.I was passing by and wanted to try it but it will be the last time. Didn't enjoy the food or service and it was pricey for what we got.
