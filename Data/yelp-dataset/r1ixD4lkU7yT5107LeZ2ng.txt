4	Really enjoyed the pizza here. A greasy neighborhood pizza place.
4	Just had their pizza again tonight, and realized that I'd forgotten how good their pie is, and that they have amazing crust.
4	When the mood for pizza strikes, I sometimes let my mood and my preferences for the perfect pie get in the way of my cravings. I'm not fond of frozen grocery store pizza. I never got the by-the-slice pizza craze. And while I have eaten a few amazing thin crust pizzas, something feels wrong about eating them on a patio with a beer, serving them to friends who helped you on a move, or snacking on a thin slice of pie while staring down a blank page when you are way behind deadline.La Frita Pizzeria get its right, and meets my different moods every time. It is the Songza of pizza: pizza for entertaining cool friends, pizza for studying, pizza for unwinding, and even pizza for waking up gently. The crust is thick and bouncy, like memory foam, but with a hint of tasty charring. The tomato sauce they use is thick and spirited, with a hint of coquettish sweetness.The cheese is melted over the top of your pie, perfectly fusing the ingredients therein and holding everything securely in place, ensuring each bite captures every flavor and your toppings don't topple and slide off each slice. Each slice also oozes with just enough grease, making each bite deliciously unctuous, and not unpleasantly oily or slimy. Their pizza is equally good in the morning, cold and slightly congealed, which is another benchmark I have for the perfect pizza. While I do prefer my pizza hot, I have been known to turn leftover slices into an impromptu early morning breakfast, and their pizza does the trick.
5	Best eggplant ricotta hot peppers pizza in town. The cheese on that baby holds the stuff in place and the crust is crunchy. Mmm. Burgers r good too. The person on the phone was very polite. Definitely will order again.
