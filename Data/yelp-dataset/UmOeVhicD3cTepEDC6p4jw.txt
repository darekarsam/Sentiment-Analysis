5	Small but very friendly bistro that specialises in the sort of food you might have at home, but with a distinct upmarket twist. For example, their 'beer battered cod' with chips is no ordinary fish and chips, but a succulent chunk of top quality cod accompanied by superb hand cut chips. I have lunch here several times a month, and pre-theatre dinners too, and keep coming back. The menu is short, but all the better for it, as you know it will be freshly made, and not hauled out of a freezer. Very friendly service from the proprietor, Roland, who serves all the customers single-handed with great efficiency. The wine list has recently become rather pricey, and the coffee is rather ordinary but plentiful, as he will top up your cup with free refills. At busy times, such as during the Festival and the Christmas season, booking is essential.

We had a little competition to see who could make the most fucked up animal out of our napkins. After the 24th minute  of waiting, I started chewing of my Camel-dog.When it came, it was lovely, but maybe I fell asleep waiting and dreamed it was good?
