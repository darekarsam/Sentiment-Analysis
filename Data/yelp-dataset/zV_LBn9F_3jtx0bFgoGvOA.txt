2	The agents were VERY friendly, which what I would expect from Hawaiian, but the process is all messed up. You get your boarding pass from the Kiosk, with your bags, then you wait in a VERY crowded space to check your bag. If you have to see an agent for unaccompanied minors or routing changes, you go into another line and wait until there are no bags to check.  This is about as friendly as Spirit Airlines where they don't care about their passengers.Thank goodness I wasn't flying, just taking a friend.  If I have to check a bag, I will fly someone else, just because of the chaos.
5	Just want to Say ThankYou Hawaiian Airlines for Making My Grandparents Flight Very Enjoyable. They Say Nothing But good things
5	AZ to HI flight: - Left on time, arrived 30 minutes early. Got lucky!- Breakfast of fruit slices, cheese & crackers, and orange juice. I thought it was tastefully done for a complementary meal.  - snack: Maui chips and a rum punch (some new product promotion. Damn lucky for drinkers. Drinks are usually so expensive!) - Water was offered thru out the flight. It worked for me!
