4	If you've never been, go.  Even if you don't like "soul food", go.  The food is good, the food is fresh, the service is excellent, and it's served up fast and hot.  The only downside is that it can get a bit pricey.  Not crazy pricey like some places, but it's not your typical soul food place either.It's a large amount of food for a fair price, but it's going to put a small dent in your wallet at the same time.  That said, you should still go.  And if you're there for breakfast, try the Chicken and Waffles.  Seriously.Alternate version here:http://www.cxliv.org/2006/05/02/the-coffee-cup/
4	The Coffee Cup is a great, but you better go quick before they tear it down.  My parents started taking me here  over 20 years ago, and everytime I go the food is delicious.  The fried chicken is great, but don't discount the BBQ chicken which is awesome, or a simple veggie plate.  The sweet tea and lemonade are out of this world, but conserve your drink, this place is so busy that refilling your cup can be the least of their worries.  Enjoy!
3	A little Soul Food at the Coffee Cup is what I wanted, and that's just what I got, I thought I'd try a little something different as we walked into the smell of frying meat and coffee, so I decided to try the fried pork chops with mashed potatoes,  it was good, greasy and covered in gravy the meat was nicely fried and the potatoes added a good starchy balance, but honestly this breakfast was a little heavy for my tastes, I know, I know what do I expect I ordered fried pork chops, so I guess I got what I asked for, it was just a little much  The service was fast and friendly and the head cook/owner was incredibly nice, making us feel welcome, and  inviting us to come back soon, nice guy, great cook, good old soul warming food.
