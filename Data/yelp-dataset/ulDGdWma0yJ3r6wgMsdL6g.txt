5	I absolutely love my lashes SO much! I've gotten them done twice before and I had to pull them off right away because they were so heavy and uncomfortable. I love the way she did them & she's such a sweetheart. I can't begin to tell you how obsessed I am with my lashes. They look dramatic as I requested but they feel so light like they're my own. Thank you so so much KK! You'll be seeing much more of me!
5	If you're looking for a place to get your eyelashes done.. You found the right place! Kk is THE BEST! I've been to many other salons and had lashes clumped up, poking my eyes, and twisted in all kinds of ways. I was hesitant going to a new salon but KK was very sweet, professional and made me feel really comfortable. Needless to say, my lashes came out BEAUTIFUL!!  Go see Kk! You won't regret it!
5	I've been coming to Kimi for a while, my lashes are always perfect and I get a lot of compliments! Everyone asks me where I got em done. She's the best!
5	I literally just left Dollhouse. I've never gotten my lashes done before but have been wanting to for a long time. I'm an Okinawan gyal. That means my natural lashes are short. Kimi is very good at explaining everything you need to know about the extensions including after care. She is very efficient yet takes her time to make sure your lashes look good. I was so relaxed during tie whole process that I actually feel asleep. So glad my hairdresser Sandi told me about Dollhouse.  :/ Anyways I'm so glad I got them done tonight. I LOVE my new look. I feel very beautiful :)  Thank you Kimi. See you in 2 to 3 weeks.
5	Very happy with my lashes and would recommend to anyone. I'll continue coming back
5	Wow! She's fast and did an amazing job! I am very happy with my lashes and will definitely be back. The salon is nice too. Highly recommended :-)
