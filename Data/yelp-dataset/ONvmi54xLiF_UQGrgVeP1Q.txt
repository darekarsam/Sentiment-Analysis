4	Went in to get a price sheet for some local info and the people were super nice and friendly.  Place was clean and really presentable.
4	Great development!  Great facilities. Nice floor plans, reasonable prices. Very safe community and location. Great maintenance. Highly recommend.
1	The Allison is under new management and has totally gone down the drain.  Poor maintenance, too many dogs, trees that are falling down, paint peeling off the exterior of the bldg., a/c not working properly.  This bldg. is  over 25 yrs  old and is falling apart.  Management is rude and does not address tenant's concerns.
4	I've lived here for A month so far and have found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. I wish I would've looked at all available Apts instead of believing they were identical...I would've loved a fireplace instead of the odd cutouts I have in the same place...especially because you need a small TV to fit in the space. Otherwise, the cabinets, countertops, flooring, and blinds, are all extremely nice and well built. Stainless steel appliances complete the top of the line feel. Only negatives are the lack of coat closet and pantry and ceiling fans in liv rm and bedroom have no lighting. Be prepared to buy lamps. Neighborhood is great and the apt grounds are beautiful. If you live on the first floor be prepared to hear your neighbors above moving from room to room, flushing their toilet, and closing cabinets and cupboards. If I stay, which I can't imagine why I wouldn't, the only change I'd make is definitely moving to a 2nd floor unit. Otherwise, I'd recommend these condos to everyone who asked. And I would even consider purchasing a 2 BDRM 2 bath unit.
