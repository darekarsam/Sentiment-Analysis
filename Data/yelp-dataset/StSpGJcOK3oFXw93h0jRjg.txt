2	The only reason I'll even give SECU two stars is that I did end up with a pretty decent mortgage for my house here, and I also bought a nice birdhouse from them (inexplicably sold in the front lobby).  But my praise begins and ends there.  The biggest problem with the SECU is their terrible hours.  Why, oh why, is the bank only open when we are at work???  Closing at 5:30?  Not even open on Saturday mornings???!!!  It's just crazy.  I've also found their customer service to be lacking (at least, on the phone), and they have NO ATMs uptown.  While I wanted to get away from Wachovia/Wells and BorA, I'm starting to realize that all these banks are the same (i.e. terrible).  Unfortunately, no bank I've found down here matches up with the service and convenience of my former bank, Citibank.
