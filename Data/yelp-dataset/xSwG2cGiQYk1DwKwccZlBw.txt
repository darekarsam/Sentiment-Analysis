1	Disgusted I even have to choose a star. Horrible service. And the worker named roman is very unprofessional. He ignored me the first few minutes I was in there and then proceeded to make sexual comments towards me even after I told him I had a boyfriend. I was so disturbed by his behavior I had to run out of there without purchasing anything. DO NOT GO HERE!
2	Clean shop, did fine for what I had done but I can't justify spending $30 for just a taper and lining. This place needs to get their pricing broken down better, astronomical prices for mediocre work. Also, no military discount... I doubt I'll give these guys a second chance.
5	Went to Elite Barbers on my lunch break and was not disappointed. Blake was my barber and he gave me one of the best cuts I've ever had. He took the time to get to know me personally and ensured that my experience was of the highest caliber. Despite the shop being rather unassuming, the barbers are friendly, relaxed, and extremely knowledgeable in their craft. If you are looking for the perfect style, I would highly recommend this shop.
5	Had my hair cut and beard trimmed here. Great service and good prices, this is definitely my new barbershop.
