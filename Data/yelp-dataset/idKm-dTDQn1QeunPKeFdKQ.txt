5	Good pizza, open after the bars closed.  But I'm certain my drunkedness has little to do with how good it tasted.  Yeah.  That's it.
5	Delicious. Cheap. Open late.
3	Pizza is OK. Poutine fries were burned badly on several occasions.Prices are low, but not in significant competition with other pizza joints in the area.It is an institution, and it's close to Prince Arthur street. They could, however, achieve much more and much better.
3	3.5 starsStopping at Madonna's was a quick detour out of our food-venture during montreal's street festival on Saint-Laurent Boul. I got the All Dressed pizza. For those that don't know, "all dressed" in canada is highly similar to  "the works" in US. To break that down, its a combination of mushrooms, green peppers, and pepperoni. Their pizza is comparable to new york style, large slices, thinner crust. They threw on a good amount of toppings on there as well. Open late, super cheap at $2.50 a piece.Oh and I had this sober, super yums still.
1	I'm pretty indifferent about the food, but the service is just plain rude. I ordered fries and was prepared a poutine (I'm a vegetarian so I did not and have not ever ordered poutine). When I corrected him he kept going "you saw me put on the gravy. you saw me put on the cheese and you said nothing." There's no way I could have seen any of this from where I was standing which I pointed out (not that stopping him post-gravy would have saved the fries anyway) but it didn't stop him from repeating this rant about four or five times. He then told me next time to speak louder and he would get me what I wanted. Next time. Yeah right. There are dozens of other places in the area with a similar menu and prices, and their staff is almost universally more polite.
4	Treats poutine like it should be treated: quick and dirty fast food. Molten cheese curds, thick gravy and crispy fries, it doesn't get better than this.
