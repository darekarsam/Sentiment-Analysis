2	I mean this in the nicest way possible, this is a redneck, shit kicking bar. Which is fine if you're into that kind of thing. I'm sure I would have spent time here in my college days. They do have really cheap beer specials as well as several local brews.There will no doubt be some loud drunks hanging around and possibly a band that is to loud. With so many great bars in South Charlotte I can't imagine why you would go here, but I guess it fills a niche market. I don't mean to offend anyone (if you like this place), it's just not my style. Cheers!
5	"Madison Park Pub with Rock music on the Jukebox, Pool Tables and plenty of space. (Saturday night live band!) Delicious offering of craft beer and sandwich/grill menu plus daily drink & food specials. Friendly staff and mixed local crowd from age 21 to 60. My sandwich was fresh and tasty despite the late hour.. I'm going back soon.
1	Well.  Based on the great reviews I walked a mile over here from my hotel.  And it was a whole lot of CLOSED.  Sunday night at 8:20.  Not sure what the deal is.  So.  Be warned!!
1	Pretty sure this place is CLOSED FOR BUSINESS. I've not seen it open in quite some time.
