4	It's a chain! But I like it! Their chicken caesar wrap is only 370 calories and it's pretty filling! They serve pizza and paninis too. Great for a quick bite. Anyway,I have to go back and try their other things!
4	Lots of food for not so much money is always great.I went with a friend, and she had the buffalo chicken panini which she loved and couldn't finish, and I had the black beans and rice bowl (which I shouldn't have finished but did). Simple flavors combined to be delicious.Even aside from the food, I really like this place in general. I like the setup inside, and the staff is really nice, though the manager kept popping up next to us to ask how we were doing/how the food was, and surprising us every time. Also, I love the music they play. Apparently it's the Coffee House station of Sirius Satellite radio. Good stuff.I wonder if they have wi-fi...
4	Great restaurant. Sure, it's a chain and a bit pricey for the amount of food, but it is tasty and quick. We were in for a college visit and ate there twice.The flat bread pizzas are great and the quesadillas are good. Greek salad is yummy.
5	Can't get enough of this place.  I've had a different item each visit and loved every one.  Prices are pretty good and the staff is incredibly friendly.  It's a good thing I don't live in the apartments above.
