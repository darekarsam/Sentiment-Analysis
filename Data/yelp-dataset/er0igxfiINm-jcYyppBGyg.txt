4	They where not even  open and being rude to everyone around.  Good example of bullies yelling in Japanese over their cell phone. No respect for local community. Do not even care to talk French.  Pretend to be busy with family and friends (suprising to think they have friends, money but not friends..)To Avoid completely, the owner gave me the finger when | asked him to keep is down. All on file
1	The Best Worst Restaurant?!The decor is beautiful, clean and modern. What can go wrong?Bad service + cheap food! I highly recommend the owner to provide a learning session to his/her staff about "customer service".  If you are in a restaurant business and your staff doesn't give a damn about thing. You are destined to fail.  And please invest in quality food please!  We are in 2013 now, cheap food just doesn't cut it. You know the quality is bad when the food from food court places taste and look better than the food here. This restaurant has so much potential. But from what I experienced so far...it is not good...not good my friends!
1	Paid $18 (including tax and tip) for the worst beef teriyaki (lunch special) on the planet. The miso soup was basically just salt water.
5	Always very friendly and the food is exquisite!  LOVE IT!
