2	The guy behind the counter was great! but the pizza was not.. sorry NYPD but you've got some work to do
3	It's a small little place hidden in the corner with a few other stores buy the Circle K. They have good specials on the pizza, so you can't really complain on that. They add the toppings you want throw it back in the oven and let it cook. Pizza is pretty good. You get some big slices. The special is for 2 but I'm sure 1 slice would fill up most people. It is kind of greasy though so that kind of kills it a bit but the flavor is pretty good. The staff is friendly and easy going and just fun to carry on a conversation with as you wait for the pizza. All in all it's not top of the line pizza but def not the worst, so if you're need in something to eat I'd recommend you stop.
4	I haven't had any pizza yet, but I'm hooked on the Caesar Salad and the Caesar Salad Wrap with Grilled Chicken.  You might have to wait a few minutes for them to prepare your meal, but you know it's fresh and it's GOOD!
