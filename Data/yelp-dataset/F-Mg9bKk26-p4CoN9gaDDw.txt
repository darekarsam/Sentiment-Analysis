5	Just picked up two pea coats from being dry cleaned at Diamond Dry Cleaners. They look great and were a great price!! The stitching for the repair of the torn pocket was perfect. I will definitely be back!
1	Came here because they advertise "wash & fold" on the yelp & on the front window (I live in the neighborhood and was so excited I didn't have to drive to Shadyside anymore). The girl told me that "we only do men's shirts here." If that's true then I'm really confused why they advertise wash & fold, if that's not true then there is a problem. I was so excited to have a dry cleaner here in the neighborhood, but since I don't wear men's shirts I guess I'll have to keep looking elsewhere.
4	I've been here several times without issue. Granted, I just have men's shirts that need to be dry cleaned, but it certainly is a convenient place for those in the Lawrenceville area.For 5 stars, the place would have to "wow" me, but like I said, it's a dry cleaner where I get my shirts cleaned...
