5	Love Robin!!!! Her studio (super adorbs I might add) is located inside of Tease Salon in Plaza-Midwood, so it's a one-stop shop if you're wanting a day of feeling fab! When I first went in for my appointment I knew I wanted a facial, but I had no idea of what I reallllllly wanted out of the treatment. Robin took the time to ask me questions and get to the root of my skin grievances. She recommended a few things and I ended up trying an O2 facial. If you've never done O2 before then you should definitely try it - your face will thank you. She even let me take home a few Image product samples to try. I will definitely be back for some additional beautifying!
5	I love Robin! She does a great job. I go to her for multiple treatments and never leave unhappy. She really takes her time to do the job right and makes sure your are comfortable the whole time. I definitely recommend Robin and Glow SkinWorks!
5	I absolutely love Robin! I go to her to get my eyebrows waxed and I have never been happier with how they've looked. If you want someone who will actually take the time to shape your brows for your face, and not just quickly wax you between manicures, she is the woman to go to! For my first appointment she spent about 30 minutes with me and not only did a killer job on my eyebrows, but paid attention to my weird skin problems & explained what caused them. When I went back the next time she gave me some samples of the skin care products she carries, & also gave my girlfriend (who isn't even a client, just happened to come with me) some as well. I highly recommend her and can't imagine going back to anyone else.
