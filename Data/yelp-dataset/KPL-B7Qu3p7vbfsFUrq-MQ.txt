5	I have a two year old daughter that we take here.  There are many things I enjoy about this swim school.The classes are very well structured, and they limit class sizes so all the children get the right amount of attention from the instructors.  The instruction itself is well organized and builds on previous classes.  I can see the enjoyment and comfort of my daughter increasing every week.The facilities are first rate, and seem to have been built specifically for the purpose of teaching children how to swim.  There are two pools.  A main pool for the more advanced swimmers, and a smaller toddler pool for... toddlers.  There is a bench for changing toddlers, and cubbies for your stuff.  There are spacious changing closets.  They also have a well stocked swim store with suits, goggles, and toys.  The parents can enjoy the classes from a comfortable viewing area.
