5	I'm easily won over by sugary treats and Brenda's Cake Gallery has plenty to go around.  Every time we're near this place I always feel the need to stand just outside the glass windows and drool over the cakes on display.  Sadly, I believe these cakes are fakes used for example only but they still look amazing.  Brenda's has a small display case just inside the front entrance where they offer a variety of tasty cupcakes, brownies, and other treats.  While they don't have a ton of prepared goodies for walk-ins, they have just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.  It's definitely worth stopping in if you're in the area and the front store is open (they have very limited hours).I believe Brenda's mostly does large cakes for weddings and parties.  Ater having cupcake samples of their red velvet cake and chocolate cake, I've been looking for reasons to order a large cake from Brenda's.
5	I have been using Brenda for years. Her cakes are always moist and delicious! She has a wonderful picture window to view all her amazing creations. They are always professional and deliver what is promised. She did not disappoint with my birthday cake this year. It was a milestone for me and the cake was perfect.
5	So this is the year of Brenda"s Cake Gallery.  This year I have had a cake from them for a Baby Shower, a Wedding and today a Birthday Party and they were all Delicious.  The coffee in the Caravan coffee shop next door is pretty darn good too.
