4	Lokaah is the sort of place that could potentially really irritate me. It could be the sort of place that accommodates for the "hippy" or "alternative" market with pretencions of being somehow really different whilst actually being like a lot of other places a lot like it. But somehow Lokaah has a real charm.This shop sells a variety of Asian scarfs, throws and pieces of clothing as well as jewellery, accessories, some generic eastern ornaments, incense, as well as some other bits and bobs thrown in like purses and bags. Actually it all manages to be pretty decent quality. The shop has the lovely permanent incense smell, and the interior is full of warm welcoming colours.I came here while looking for a throw for my new flat and ended coming away with a few things. For one the prices are really great and there are always deals and discounts on. Lokaah is also a convenient place for buying gifts and presents.One word of warning: Lokaah is currently advertising itself as closing down. Now Lokaah has said this several times before but if you do really want a visit it's maybe worth checking out soon just in case.
