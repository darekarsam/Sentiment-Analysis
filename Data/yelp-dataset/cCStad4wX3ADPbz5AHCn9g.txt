1	This place CANNOT EVER give me everything I order. They are the most worthless, slack jawed, habitual screw up's I have ever witnessed. Not only do they always forget something, but half the menu will take "another 16 minutes" according to the drive up attendant. Dont ever stop here!!!!!You will regret it!!!!Check your order before you pull away at least!!!
1	This place has NEVER gotten our order right.  Not once.  Lame.
1	I had a craving for KFC. I went through the drive through and the machine was muffled terribly. The service was slow. When I got home, the food was poor quality. The mashed potatoes were dry and the macaroni and cheese was lumpy. Even the coleslaw was very dry. The worst was the chicken strips, which were extremely dry and nearly too hard to bite into. I returned to the location to comment the next day and the man at the counter (I assume the manager) was very rude.I would not recommend this location based on service and good quality.
