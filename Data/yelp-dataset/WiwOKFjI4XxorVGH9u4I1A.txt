4	Fried chicken!! Probably the best fried chicken you can get dahntahn. The staff are friendly and the food comes up very quickly. The place is kept clean and bright and the decor is simple and no-frills.It's 'regular' Amrikan food, priced reasonably, and they do it well. The fried chicken is delicious, moist but not too greasy or heavy. The sides - mashed potatoes, mac 'n cheese, etc - are good. I can't get the fried chicken too often because my arteries would clog up but for an occasional spot, it's a very good destination.
4	Been here before I was born and with damn good reason... Sausage sucks but everything else excellent. Make sure you bring quarters for your meter they do not give change
4	Real good fried chicken. Always crispy and hot. Now the side dishes that's an all together different story.  Medicore at best, the mac and cheese is so nasty it has this pale yellow color.  I have had George Aiken cater company pot lucks and every one seems to really enjoy it. Fried Chicken for the win!!! Four stars for the chicken sans 1 for the side dishes
