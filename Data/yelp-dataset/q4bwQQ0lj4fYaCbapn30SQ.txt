5	I finally came here for the first time yesterday. Despite all my friends going so often I never once went with them. I had been missing out for so long!Though from the outside it looks dark and sketchy with covers over the windows, it is actually just hiding the great atmosphere inside. Lots of tables: about 20 I believe. Lots of seats and bars around the walls, a jukebox and even a bar to drink at. They of course serve some beers and the staff is nice and the place just has a real hip feel.It seems a lot of pros, semi-pros and other tournament goers frequent the place both for big games and practice. Keep a look out for great drink specials like $2 pints on Tuesday or $1.50 Miller Light bottles on Saturday. Saturday is $5 an hour all day for pool but there are other $5 times on various days. Highly recommended!
5	Best pool place in Charlotte area. Outdoor covered area for smoking. Great place
4	Pooool! Not a bad place. Last time I came to this University area pool hall, it was completely full with smoke. Now, since the ban on smoking has went through I throughly enjoy it a lot more. I came here on a weekday, and there was basically no one here. I played a couple games, I believe they were pretty cheap ($5 an hour?) I can't be so sure because someone else payed for it.I highly recommend to come play here if you have the free time and you like billiards!
5	My favorite place to play pool for the novice and the serious player. Wednesday nights very popular due to the 9 ball tournament and 10 ball break and run drawing. APA has league play Sunday through Thursday.  Drink specials every night
