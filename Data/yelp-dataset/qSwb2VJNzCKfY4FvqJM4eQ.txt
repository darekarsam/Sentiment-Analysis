4	One of the two main international foods stores in town, not counting Asian markets. They have not only groceries, but also a deli counter with many imported cheeses and olives. They also have some fresh, ready-to-eat items like salads, samosas and baklava.They're pretty similar to the other international food store. I usually just visit whichever one is least out of my way. This is the smaller of the two, with overall a slightly smaller selection. However, I have noticed that EuroMart has a better selection of Turkish, Greek and Bulgarian cheeses.
2	This store has been bought out by the people who own Bombay restaurant, and is primarily an Indian grocery now. I really miss Euro Mart.
