5	These dudes are the best. Great service, great explanations, and their prices are the best in town for an oil change (though this does mean that for oil changes they're always super busy - because they're awesome!)Highly recommended over nearly any other automotive care company in the vicinity - I've tried them all. These guys are the best.
5	I kinda accidentally walked in ten minutes before these guys closed, asking for an oil change.  Oops :/Like the awesome guys that they are though, they let me know that, while they would do it quickly (like, not check anything else), they would still be okay with doing it.  The guy was super nice about it.After all of this, he took me out to look over everything, was super friendly, and answered all of my questions.They are great.  I will be back if I'm ever in this area when I need anything.
5	This place is outstanding. I always get great discounts, and all the mechanics are very honest and helpful. I am certainly not rich and Marvin is always willing to assist me with my budget and what needs to be done on my vehicle. I've been given very specific directions on whatever needs to be worked on, taken back to the garage and allowed to see the old/new parts with no hassle. I would definitely recommend going here.
