4	I've gotta agree with the previous poster that this one particular Circle K is quite nice.  It must be a fairly new location.  They have a walk-in cooler where you can get larger quantities of alcohol.  They also have a large assortment of sunflower seed flavors which coincidentally is the exact reason we went.  The only gripe other than being above the average price for gas in the area is that the line was pretty long.  The 1 guy just kept ringing people up at 2 registers to keep it moving, but it still was a bit slow.  I'm definitely impressed by his work ethic though.  Some slightly shady looking people later at night when I went there though, but they might've just been shady looking and not actually shady.
