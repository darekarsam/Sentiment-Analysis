5	QT know how to do gas stations right. They are always clean, Staffed, well mannered, good knowledgeable people. I always try to go here if I can. They also have some pretty awesome sandwiches and taquitos that always pretty fresh and hot. I like there breakfast sandwiches too. AND of course the 69 cent fountain drinks.
5	Always clean, always fully stocked, never creepy people soliciting, quik trip! They also have competitive prices! Friendly customer service, too. But the title of this location is spelled wrong.
2	Quick Trip has always been my fav in the valley. Usually clean and great on service. EXCEPT THIS ONE'S BATHROOMS!  WOW. Towels on the floor and toilets that were not clean. I believe the staff need to clean the bathrooms more frequently.
5	Perfectly functional gas station. Clean, quick, and efficient. What more could I ask for?
5	I don't often write reviews about gas stations or convenience stores but this particular location is exceptional. I try to fill up my car when I am near by. It is clean and organized and functions well. There is a ton of space to get your car in and out of the gas pumps. The employees are friendly and personable and considering the volume of traffic they get through, they manage to move the customers along at a fast clip.
3	I Like this place, I really do. The staff are always nice and attentive... Then there is the Manager... A very nasty man, rude and snippy. What the heck is your issue dude? I cringe when i walk in and see you behind the counter because i know the nastiness is coming...
