1	I am changing my previous review from last year (3 stars) to 1 star. Today I had a quiche with a soup, salad, potatoes, and coffee. It was my 2nd choice because they were out ingredients for my 1st choice. The vegetable soup was greasy. The coffee was less than ordinary. The quiche was burnt on top. (See picture.) The potatoes were too salty. The salad dressing was too sweet. The only food item that was OK was my glass of water. Service was OK, not great. With the many other (and better) restaurants around, I am not planning to go back.
1	Went there as it was the only place nearby that was still open. They were on a skeleton crew on the holiday so half of the stuff we could not even order. Asked for a chocolate milk and it had gone bad 2 weeks ago. Since I returned it and didn't want milk anymore I asked for a cola and they charged me for both drinks even knowing what happened. The fruit was good. That is about it. Everything else was bad. The crepes were watered down. the syrup tasted awful. The beans came from a can. The has browns were burnt. Should have kept this place closed if it was going to be that bad.
1	This place looked so good...funk name...we decided to try it on out last day in Montreal...Big disappointment! First of all they didn't serve half of food on the menu for the reason that I didn't even understood...I think just because...Secondly, the food was horrible. I ordered baked beans with sausage and fried potatoes. what I got was overcooked can of beans with something looked like sausage.. tasted horrible...I will never go back...
