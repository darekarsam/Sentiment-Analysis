3	Ok Chinese and Thai take-away.
5	This place has been around for years and continues to deliver good quality for very reasonable prices. What I like most is that all dishes are cooked to order in front of you, which also means that any changes to the menu items can be accommodated. There are not many chinese take aways that cook each dish fresh and from scratch, which is why I like this place so much. Perfect lunchtime or pre-pubcrawl spot.
