5	I've gone here twice and been extremely satisfied both times. The first was after I'd tried to go to pink nails first thing in the morning right as they opened and they already had like ten people in there and that was a joke. So on the way home I found this little place tucked away. I walked in and was taken immediately. The techs were chatty and funny. My nails looked flawless for the holiday and they were super quick. I went back today and got a gel mani and pedi. I had them remove my acrylics which I'm always hesitant to do and they actually took the time to soak the acrylics off instead of ripping them off like the last few places I've been. Again I walked in today and there was no wait. Someone immediately took me to a pedi chair. Lots of magazines and looked clean. This might be my permanent place. Only thing I didn't like was for some reason they like peeled the old gel polish off of my toes instead of nail polish remover. Well have to see if they do it again
4	After trying over 11 other nail salons and getting some pretty bad work done not to mention attitude issues, I found Eric and Betty. They listen, I work with my hands so they know where to reinforce my nails so they don't break. If one breaks by accident, I have never been charged for the repair! Betty does the best work on polish and Eric knows where to not tickle my feet which are extremely sensitive. Great people and nice to know that there is actual customer service in this town! Going on three years now.....
5	I love this nail salon! I've been to a couple to get my eyebrows done and maybe a French manicure but they don't compare. It's a little off to the side in a business complex and it's small but that's what I love about it. It's not over crowded. I've been coming here for 5 years and the owners are amazing :) great customer service!
