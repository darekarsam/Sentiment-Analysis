4	Excellent service. Very tasty. Classical setting in a old house. Formal, but warm. Might be a bit overcooked for the veal chop
5	The restaurant is in an old stone house and I love the ambiance.  The service is good and the prices are reasonable for what you get.  The antipasti are quite big so it's definitely worthwhile splitting amongst two people.  The Caprese salad and arugula parmesan salad are good choices.  Both are very simple yet very tasty.  When it comes to the main course the rabbit is an excellent choice.  It's seasoned nicely and very moist.Their tiramisu is excellent here.  I find a lot of places drizzle the alcohol over the ladyfingers making it overpowering.  If it's worked into the mascarpone mixture then it doesn't drown out the other flavours.  My guess is that they do the latter because there's a nice delicate balance of flavour in the tiramisu.Overall it's an excellent restaurant and it's definitely worth the trip.
