5	Lovely wee addition to this part of town! Bright, airy and spacious, with plenty of light coming in the huge windows. perfect for people watching!A big array of savoury wraps, rolls and sandwiches as well as sweet treats. I had a tasty toasted scone and an americano - made with a very delicious and well pulled shot of Artisan roast coffee.If i lived in the area I would definitely hunker down here more often and do productive things. Only issue for me is the distance from my house! :(
