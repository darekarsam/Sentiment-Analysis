2	Bathrooms are dingy, decent Jerky selection. Water and Gas are super expensive - tank up before you cross the desert.Lots of dirty kids in the parking lot.. what's up with that?
2	This is one expensive stop. The gas here is very expensive. Go fill up else where.
3	I didn't actually go in but it wasn't busy and we were in and out quickly getting gas.
5	Whether its late at night or early in the morning Short Line Express Market is my goto stop for gas and quick cool drinks.The Staff is great and always in a great mood. I will continue to fill up my car and tummy at this location and suggest you do so as well.
