5	I had never really heard of Lime Blue until I was given a beautiful necklace for Christmas.  The necklace was really different and unusual, so I went into the shop just to see what they have. They have a lovely selection of really different, quirky jewellery and have a modern twist on a modern piece. Saying that, their jewellery isn't garish or over the top, it's understated and really simple. I can't really say it has a particular style, because its style is brand new. They don't follow the trend, they set it, man.Their prices are a bit on the pricey side, but with each piece you get a huge elaborate box and a cloth, so you're paying around  10% for the packaging. Take that, mother nature!
4	Lime Blue is a gorgeous jewellery shop, the kind of place you would come if you were buying a really, super special piece of jewellery.Their diamond jewellery is stunning and their engagement and wedding rings are out of this world. They also have a great range of bracelets and jewellery for special birthday and to commemorate special anniversaries. The jewellery is gorgeous but the layout of the shop doesn't show it at it's best, I realise that it's presented the way it is because of security reasons but the whole shop feels very linear and boring when they could dot the glass cabinets about a bit and make it a bit more funky rather than just going along a line and looking at one display after another. For a jewellers, it's just a little bit boring.  They stock Pandora which is a bit more purse friendly and even though I can't stand Pandora, I have a lot of friends who love it and have the charm bracelets so it's excellent for gifts as you can pop in and buy charms for friends and family who have charm bracelets.
