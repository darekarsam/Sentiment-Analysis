5	Awesome! Very traditional and unique flavors. Like a Mexican/Senoran 31 flavors with a frescas bar!
5	The service was great! The people and food were authentic. I have been to many Mexican type restaurants but this was my first time at a Mexican dessert place.  And it wasn't the typical Mexican desserts like flan but they had a fresca bar, fresca snow cones like a snow cone with tamerindo.  Frescas con crem that had snow cone ice, cream, ice cream and fruit, sounds a little different (and it was) but was very good.If your looking for a dessert that's a little different try this place, you won't be disappointed!
5	Great customer service.  Great selection of authentic  Mexican treats that taste GREAT!
