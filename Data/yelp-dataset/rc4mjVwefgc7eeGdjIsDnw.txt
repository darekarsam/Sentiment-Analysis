3	Food is ok and service is fast but it's cheap. So I guess it's not bad. Though the waiter sucks couldn't keep his eyes off TV screen. I still go back just because it's close to my place
5	One of the hidden gems of Saint-Laurent. This is genuine authentic cambodian food! The service is very kind and friendly and very fast as well! I ordered the ginger chicken and it was delicious, would definitely order again. For the price, it was for sure worth the money. If you guys really want really good and authentic cambodian food this is really the place to come.
4	I went to Asie Moderne to try one particular dish.I ordered their sour soup with tripe and beef. I was very happy! I grew up eating Cambodian dishes and the soup taste just like my mom used to make it.
