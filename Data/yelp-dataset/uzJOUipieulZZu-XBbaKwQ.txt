5	I've been calling Daniel out to my house for the past 3 months and can't really complain about anything. He's done an amazing job with our mesquite trees, lawn, and bushes. What really set him apart was his willingness to go the extra mile and make sure that the work was done correctly the first time around. I've recommended DD to a couple of my friends and neither of them have had anything negative to say about his service either. I'll continue calling him for my landscaping in the future.
5	Daniel has done a great job, timely and efficiently for us.  We've had a couple of jobs that were time sensitive and he was able to get it done.  Would definitely recommend his services to others.
