5	Their specialty is sliders. I tried the crab cake slider which was well seasoned (I'm from Maryland) with a remoulade sauce. My man went with the steak slider complete with a chimichurri sauce and friend plantain. Went back for seconds and gobbled up their gouda mac and cheese. Be on the lookout for this truck!
5	Met these guys at a Yelp party.  The crab cake slider was wonderful.  Tons of flavor.  Also had a steak slider that was very good but the crab cake stole the show!   The owners were very friendly.  I'll be looking for these guys next time I'm in Charlotte!!!
5	Man oh Man! I am so glad we found these guys at the Yelp party! Now we have to start hunting them down all over town! Seriously, if you see this truck out you gotta stop and try the steak sliders and the crab cake sliders!
5	On their first night this two rocked out at the Yelper Party. Congrats! This was some of the best food truck food I v'e had in a while. I can't imagine how better they will be with a little more time under their belt. First walking in you knew they were the crowd favorite with the longest line all night. The sliders, mac & cheese & Crab cake were all amazing. I can't wait to try you guys again.
5	Umm....YES!!! I work at Coliseum Centre 3 and they are here on Wednesdays! What a treat. I love the options and everything is delish. The food definitely provides a unique flavor, something more appealing to the experimental or multicultural palette. I am so thrilled to have an option that isn't just burgers, bbq, and tater tots. Definitely my favorite food truck day of the week!
