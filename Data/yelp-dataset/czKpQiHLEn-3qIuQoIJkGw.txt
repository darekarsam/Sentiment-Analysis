5	Top notch service! They were able to figure out why my machine kept jamming when the last two company's said to just replace the whole unit. Definitely will see them first if I need service or upgrade to the equipment.Thanks you guys rock!
5	Love this place!  Very knowledgeable staff, Great prices, expert repair services.  I would recommend to anyone.
1	Called this company in Las Vegas for service on my samsung copier. Paid $79 and was told to put it out at the street. Guy said I got ripped off when I bought it and it was junk.  I called another repair company. He had it fixed in ten minutes. No parts necessary.  He downloaded new drivers and it worked. It says a lot for someone who actually knows what they are doing
