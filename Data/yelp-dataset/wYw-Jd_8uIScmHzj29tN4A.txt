5	One of the few (only?) body shops that I could find on a Saturday morning; so that's how we settled, and we really lucked out. Hadi Ghrairi juggled his schedule for to meet with us, gave us a quote that was pretty much what the research pointed to - and even got to work the very next day.  We had a cracked up front fender and bumper and he was able to find us after-market parts, replaced, paint matched and even was cool enough to buff out and repaint another scrape that was not part of the quote.Hadi, you mah dawg! I'm gonna join a demolition derby just so we can hang out more!
5	I had to replace a rear Prius bumper and Hadi Ghrairi offered a great price with very fast turnaround time.  I first called him Thursday evening, he had a replacement bumper to start painting on Friday morning, and he met me on Saturday when  the final paint coat dried to return the car.   The paint is identical to the original bumper and he guaranteed the paint job for as long as I own the car. Bringing my car here was like bringing it to a friend who is working in your best interest.  I hope I never need work done again, but if I do I'm coming here.
5	This body shop is the best! Hadi Ghrairi goes above and beyond to make his customers happy! I am new to Charlotte and was in a fender bender. I had no idea where to go but luckily found Custom Paint and Body! He came in on a Saturday when not many other body shops are open to give me an estimate. The following Tuesday the job was complete! I looked around and got a few different estimates, his was the best out of all of them and he was able to complete the job in one day compared to others that needed two full days to fix my car! In addition he offered to give me a ride back to my car that was not being worked on so I didn't have to wait, take a bus, or be stranded. This body shop earns all five stars with ease! Hopefully I am not in any more wrecks for a while but if I am I know where i will go to get my car repaired!
