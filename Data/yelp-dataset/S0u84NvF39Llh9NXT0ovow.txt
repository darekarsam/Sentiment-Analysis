1	Not sure it would be easy to find someone more UNPROFESSIONAL, RUDE or CONDESCENDING on the phone then the person that answered my call to inquire about a repair for a tenant in one of the properties we manage.  I hung up.
5	We needed help at 5:00pm on a Sunday and A-1 Appliance was at our home within 30 minutes and the refrigerator was working within an hour.  Eddie and Andrew (our technician) were polite, professional and a great service to have in an emergency.  Thank you A1Appliance.
1	RUDE SCAM ARTIST- BEWARE!!oh.. and they also got the diagnosis of the problem WRONG! When I asked what was the problem the technician responded with just "$490", didn't even tell me what was broken! After making him spell it out he said the mag tube was bad and it almost $500 to buy. Online it was only 130- 150 AT MOST! We bought the part and had it installed (by someone other than them), and guess what- NOT THE PROBLEM. They're the most unqualified jerks you could ever ask for- If you're worried about money - then save yourself some and don't hire these jerks that charge you $80 to tell you nothing.
