4	Good hotel set next to the Zoo so great if your planning going there , easy to get bus into town as on main bus route. Good food although quite expensive for what you get.
3	I think the only reason I'm doing this review so early is because I'm desperately trying to stay awake.  It's 6:30pm here in Edinburgh and my husband and I arrived from Pittsburgh this morning.  International travel really takes a toll on my body and it normally takes me a day or so to recuperate.But anyways, the best way to describe this place?  Well, it's a Holiday Inn!  It's a typical chain hotel with typical amenities.  The rooms are a little smaller than what most of us from the U.S. are accustomed to.  But ours is pleasant enough.  It seems clean, has typical amenities, a nice TV, seems reasonably quiet, and the bed seems reasonably comfortable.  I understand this place caters to a lot of tour groups, so we'll find out how quiet it is tonight.As I mentioned, it normally takes me a day to recover from an overnight flight.  This place does have a swimming pool and fitness center, so I'll check 'em out tomorrow.  It's also right down the block from the Edinburgh Zoo, so if I feel up to it, I'll wander over there.  Rick's going to go find his model railroad store and probably do a little trainwatching (or trainspotting as they call it here).  Good for him!  Oh one other thing.  This hotel is a few miles from the City Center (Downtown), but it is on a major bus route.
