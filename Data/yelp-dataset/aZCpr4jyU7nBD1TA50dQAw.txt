5	In Vegas for an extended road trip for work.  Instead of staying in a hotel, my co-workers and I opted for a furnished apartment.  I'm not really sure what the other reviewer is talking about, because our experience here has been great so far.  The apartment was clean and freshly painted when we moved in, the grounds are well kept and very well maintained.  The office staff is friendly and helpful.  I really can't say enough good things about Sahara West, we came here on short notice and they bent over backwards to help us get in and settled.  Also, it's located in the middle of everything you'd ever need!  Great place in my opinion!
5	Lived here for more than a year now. Clean and well taken care of. Staff is friendly and attentive to your needs.
