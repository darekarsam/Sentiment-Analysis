4	I am very happy Madison finally has an antique oddities shop. I was pleasantly surprised by finding true medical antiquities and and just strange fun decor. The prices are quite reasonable and the store is displayed well. I will definitely be going back.
4	Well... it's odd. I'll give 'em that. (heh, heh)If you're looking for a fun five minutes, pop your head in! The experience is just plain fun regardless of whether or not you're looking for something specific. Go. Pass time!
5	This place is fantastic. I like weird old vinyl, and rarely find anything I'm interested in. Not so at Afterlife. I was interested in most of what they had, bought a few of them. Their antiques seem pretty wacky too. Make no mistake, this is the kind of place you'll love if you have a "Keep Madison Weird" bumper sticker. The kind of place that is an endangered species in cities across America. A truly unique shop full of the care and taste of an individual not a corporation, full of truly cool oddball antiques. No insincere simulated Urban Outfitters nostalgia here, just a touching and odd sense of history.I bought one of their mystery bags too, and it was great; a self-help book from the 70s called "Lovers Who Are Friends," a mysterious old framed photo, and some other odds & ends.Go Nicole! I hope your business thrives. Keep keeping Madison weird! :-)
3	Kind of interesting, but hard to view everything seeing as it's such a tight space. Just a place to kill time. Glad it's there for amusement purposes, but I don't think I'd ever buy anything. It's a bit too expensive for my taste.. they have animal penis bones for sale at around 4 or 5 bucks and the most I'd ever pay is $3.99.. I mean, come on.
