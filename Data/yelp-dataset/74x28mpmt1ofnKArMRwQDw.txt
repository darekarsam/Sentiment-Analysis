4	A good boutique cheese shop with personal service and cheese selection that is somewhat more unique and higher end than most larger places.
4	Selection & service! They aren't exactly giving the cheese away, but you don't go bargain-hunting in Outremont.
4	A regular stop when I am hosting a big dinner or want to offer a variety of cheese to my guests. Very interesting selection, friendly service, and great cheese. It's a small shop so it can get crowded.
