4	A local gem on the North Side (Deutschetown) providing quality dry-cleaning services. The two regular ladies at the front counter are super nice. Their boss, however, is not and lacks customer service skills. Lucky for us...he's hardly ever around.Check or cash only.Overall, Pfennigs's is reliable and will do a good job handling all your dry-cleaning needs.
1	The problem with this dry cleaner is poor counter service.  I have never been treated in such a poor manner - and the sad part is that this SERVICE provider doesn't care.  I recommend going elsewhere.  They are not worth my money.
5	Best Cleaner in Pgh.!  If you have quality clothing , and want your clothing to look beautiful after being cleaned go to Pfennings !!! Excellent services !
5	By far the best dry cleaner in the City of Pittsburgh.I cannot count how many times Pfennig's has provided excellent customer service, had my order ready the day they said it would be and the work was simply perfect.  When I read Yelp reviews like the one provided by Ed R. of Canonsburg, PA who whine about poor customer service and leave a negative review AND fail to provide specifics about such "bad customer service" it leads me to believe that the review is bogus, fake or simply a competitor who relies on leaving such negative reviews because their business isn't up to snuff and businesses like Pfennig's actually do a great job of serving the public and provide a quality service that provides value.Pfennig's is a local independent business that does what it takes to insure a great experience and value for the $$.  You won't regret using them.
