3	Good selection of espadrilles when compared to Foot Locker which seemingly specializes in clown shoes. The service is juvenile and unfocused - thankfully I just need them to get the box in the back.
2	Location: Excellent - in the heart of downtown.Selection: Excellent - they have a wide selection of clothing suited to various activities, as well as sunglasses, cycling gear etc. Service: What service? No one will greet you or come up to you to see if you need anything. You have to seek out someone to access the change rooms, and the clerks don't bother checking in with you to see if you need another size.  As well, I was looking for specific shoes, which they had - but I had to wait aout 5+ minutes while the one clerk on the floor (it was lunch hour - come on!) chatted away with a couple. He saw me, but ignored me so he could continue his conversation. Professional? I think not. They didn't have the shoes in my size, and the clerk was perfectly happy to send me on my way without offering to do a stock check to see if another store had them, nor did he suggest another shoe from the selection that they did have. Fail.
