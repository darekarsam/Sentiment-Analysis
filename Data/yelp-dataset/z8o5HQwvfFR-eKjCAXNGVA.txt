5	Dr Reddy and Dr Fant are amazing!  The staff is incredible.  Trust your eyes to the best!
5	From the moment I talked to Marcie on the phone to hearing her tell me to take care as I was leaving, my experience with Shepherd Eye Center was outstanding!  I have a chalazion on my eyelid and it is incredibly painful.  I've never had one before and explained what was going on to Marcie who was incredibly comforting and professional.  I've been to the office twice since the episode started almost 2 weeks ago.  I've seen Dr. Reddy and Dr. Montgomery who were both very nice and assured me that my eye will be back to normal soon.  While the waiting room and other areas have had quite a few people in them I didn't have to wait long.  The Dr's didn't rush me and I felt that all my questions were answered and that they cared about me.  I noticed also that they had a great selection of glasses available.  I work with seniors and know that if they, or people of any age, need competent, caring folks taking care of their eyes...Shepherd Eye Center is the best place to go!  I honestly was very impressed with them and the care I've received.
1	Probably the most unfriendly, robotic place I've ever been to. I am relatively sure upon being hired here you must agree to not engaged in conversation with the client or smile at them. The doctor, well i had to stop him twice from leaving the room to answer questions. Oh I was only told I had a detached retina and he's ready to run to the next patient. Guess my 2 minutes with him was up. NEVER AGAIN!!
