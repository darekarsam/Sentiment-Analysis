4	Mean sandwich, as usual. Located in the new Forum Food Court at Caesars Palace. I grab Earl of Sandwich every time I go to Vegas so I was excited to see another one open. My family was shopping at the Forum Shops and needed a quick bite. We decided to eat at the food court we passed by on our way to the shops. Little did I know that the Forum Food Court opened that very day.I ordered an Avocado BLT on wheat. Loved how they used crumbled bacon instead of bacon strips. Every bite had the right amount of bacon, lettuce, and tomato. Avocado can make just about any sandwich better. The balance between the avocado and mayonnaise was just right which really put this sandwich over the top for me.Service with a smile and no lines during this visit. Hope it stays that way. Earl of Sandwich, conquering Caesars Palace.
4	Stumbled upon this place while walking around Caesars palace. I'm obsessed with the earl of sandwich inside planet hollywood (literally go there every time I'm in vegas) so I was pleasantly surprised to find a new location! This branch is inside a mini food court next to smash burger, a ramen place, starbucks and a seafood restaurant so there's plenty of seating and different food options of someone in your party isn't craving a sandwich. You can't go wrong with the full montague or chipotle chicken sandwich, but every sandwich I've tried is good. The bread is crunchy and soft and the ingredients are of good quality. Eat a sandwich there, take one to go.. Yum!
3	Hawaiian BBQ was really good.But honestly the line was so long and all of the other sandwiches tasted like a better version of subway. Sure the quality and taste was decent but for $8 each Id rather go somewhere else.Overall,I (barely) recommend.
