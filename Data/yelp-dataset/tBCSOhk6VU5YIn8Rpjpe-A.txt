1	I frequented Prestige cleaners because it was in close proximity to where I lived at the time. It was conveninent and I was new to the 'dry-cleaning drive-thru' concept....what a great idea!!What I was not accustomed to....was a dry cleaners losing my clothes....TWICE!! The thought of someone else in Scottsdale walking around in my clothes was disturbing!!First they lost a cashmere sweater (that I only wore once!!) and then a pair of pants that was part of a suit! After numerous whining episodes they reimbursed me for what they deemed was the cost. Apart from that somehow whatever the process they use - they were notorious for cracking all of the shell buttons on my shirts....so needless to say all of my Prada shirts have chipped buttons YAY - at least they have good taste!! HA!!I will never go back! I will never go back! I will never go back!!
4	Never had any problems, left something in my pocket it was returned.  Same day service is great!
5	I've been coming to Prestige for  years. Always outstanding service from employees who seem to love their job. Kudo's to Prestige management for taking care of their employees..it shows in their level of service to their customers.
4	I really love the drive up service. I have been coming here for about 6 month and have not had a problem.  I will keep using them. :)
1	I just picked up 15 pieces of dry cleaning. It totaled $125. It would have been $140 without a coupon. This is just ridiculous. I don't care what kind of service you claim to have, there is no reason for this.I will not be back.
