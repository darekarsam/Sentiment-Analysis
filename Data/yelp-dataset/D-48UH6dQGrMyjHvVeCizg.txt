5	I highly recommend Shadow Hills Baptist Church.  The people are very friendly.  It is a large church, but not too large that you get lost. Pastor Mike and Pastor Bob are very nice and approachable.  Pastor Mike is the Senior Pastor. He does an amazing job of teaching the life lessons in the bible.  The people are very friendly. They have a great program for kids.The best kept secret is Pastor's Bible Study on Sunday mornings.  Get to church at 7:30 am, enjoy some coffee, and be ready to learn a great deal about the bible from Pastor Mike at 8am.I was saved, married and we dedicated our baby at Shadow Hills.  We've since moved to San Diego, but Shadow Hills will always be in our heart.
5	Great church, pastor and people
5	This has been my church for about 25 years (it was West Oakey previously). Love the teaching,  the music ( the choir and the band are phenomenal! ), and the love reflected all around. Come join us on Saturday nights at 5 or Sunday mornings at 8:45, 10:15, or 11:30.
