5	I am so glad that I found Dr. David Rusick. Our good friend, Dr. Chad Stewart, recommended him to me. Chad is also a chiropractor, but his clinic is in Laveen, so it's not very convenient for me to go to. Chad's very own wife goes to see Dr. Rusick, so what does that say? The staff there is very friendly, and everyone takes such good care of me. Whether I am in for a regular adjustment or I am in a lot of pain and need special attention, I always feel a million times better after visiting this clinic.
5	Dr Rusick is awesome! I was having chronic neck and upper back pain when one of my friends referred me to him. After just a few appointments I was feeling much better.  Dr Rusick will listen to what is bothering you and will come up with a plan to help your problem.
5	Dr. Rusick is an excellent chiroprator.  His staff is professional, his office is always clean, and best of all I always feel better after an adjustment.  I love to stay active and tend to put a lot of stress on my body.  Dr. Rusick helps keeps me feeling strong and active even through my pregnancies!
5	Very professional and  Dr. Rusick is an excellent chiropractor!
