5	They are awesome! Coming from me, that's saying a lot. My entire life, I've been afraid of the dentist, and I've had some bad experiences with others (one example: as a teenager, one chipped my front tooth during a cleaning). So when I first saw Dr. Enos, not only was I terrified of the dentist office but I also had a lot of cavities after many, many years of avoiding dentists. Dr. Enos was patient, friendly, and most of all understanding. She explained things fully and always made sure I was comfortable. By the end of our several visits, I was no longer as afraid! I can't believe I'm saying this, but I don't mind going to the dentist anymore, and it's all thanks to Dr. Enos and staff at Dental Arts of Chandler! Don't get me wrong, I still needed the laughing gas when there was a drill, but at least I knew and still know that I'm in good hands with people who know what they are doing. If you have a dentist phobia, Dr. Enos will be a life (and teeth) saver!!!
