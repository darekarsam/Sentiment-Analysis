5	Great selection ! Great prices !
2	This is a great store with very helpful staff. The customer service gets 4 stars, the pricing gets 0 stars. I bought a pair of Prada sunglasses here for $330.00. I wound up finding them online for $189. I returned them the next day. My recommendation would be to research pricing before you buy a pair of sunglasses here.
1	Buyer beware! Save your time and money and buy your sunglasses online from another retailer. The prices at Solstice are almost 40% higher as compared to Amazon, etc. The customer service at fashion square is pathetic to say the least as well. From the sales person to the district manager, this company is one of the poorest examples of a staff I've ever encountered.
