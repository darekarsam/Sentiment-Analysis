5	Dr. Larabee is an extremely skilled orthodontist! My kids have been his patients for a couple of years and we are extremely pleased with the results. He is so nice & his team is always so friendly and kind. We drive 45 minutes each way just to see him!
5	Your ReviewI am MOM OF 3 ADVANCED ORTHODONTICS clients, all whom have completed their journey with Dr. Larabee and his staff. Our AO experiences have been nothing short of perfect, just like my kids' teeth. We had a very scary and devistating cheerleading injury to my oldest where 4 of her front teeth were knocked out of place. She was in so physical pain, but the emotional trauma was even more devastating. Here she was, a beautiful 15 year old with teeth falling out of her mouth. Dr. Larabee not only stabilized and saved her teeth, but gave her back the most beautiful smile you could ever imagine. She now is a sophomore in college and we watch her cheer for Creighton University in Nebraska on TV. When the camera zooms in on her, you cannot help but smile back at the girl with the bright red lipstick and the gorgeous perfect teeth. Thank you Dr. Larabee, you were and still are amazing.
