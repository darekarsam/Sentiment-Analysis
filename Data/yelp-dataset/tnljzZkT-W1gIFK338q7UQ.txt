1	I gave Century Link a try and wanted to compare it to COX. There's not much to say but their service and internet speed does not compare. I tested it for about 2-3 nights, check the speed test and just isn't close.I closed the account and said i was not satisfied. The person at this century link said i was good to go and did not have any outstanding payments. A few months later they say i owe them $30. It's only $30 but still. Crappy product, crappy service. Don't bother.
5	Got tired of the Cox price increases and gave CenturyLink a try. The rep, JC,, was very helpful in doing a bill comparison and features comparison to show that I'd get more for less money with CenturyLink.I have Prism Premium which includes all of the movie channels instead of paying for each one monthly like I used to. I bundled that with their internet. He said I was on their 1 gig network. I decided to get 40 meg which has been more than sufficient for my family.  All in all, I'm happy I switched and even happier I'm saving money.
1	When it works it's fine.Ive had outages each day since last Friday.Everytime I call to report them it's always an "area outage".Everyday?Really?
