5	Healthy, organic, delicious.Ranging from dried fruits, nuts, granola, chocolate, to coffee and tea, you will find exactly what you are looking for.I love this place and always pop in when strolling through Westmount. Their dark chocolate covered cherries are phenomenal, as is their dark chocolate covered blueberries. I'm very curious to try their dark chocolate covered ginger, the idea of it intrigues me. They have amazing granola too, sweetened and unsweetened. And I absolutely love their lime & black pepper macadamia nuts, among their other assortments. This place is amazing, and even provides gift baskets! I have never been disappointed by the quality at Sunsource, and its employees are always more than willing to help!
