5	Paul is a true professional (committed to his clients and the real estate business) and he knows the local market well. He was very helpful and creative is his ideas for preparing our house for sale and with helping us understand how and what we should look for in a new home. We liked that he was independent and the owner of his own business. Perhaps most important, he was a good listener and was truly interested in learning and knowing what was important to us." ~ Marty Moore
1	Renting from them is a nightmare. They don't understand the language in a lease agreement and take much too long to respond to any repair requests, if they do at all. Be careful dealing with them. Have enough money for an attorney and a good one.
1	Not satisfied.  We used them to rent a house in fort mill. Told them and wrote on the lease concerns that need to be addressed and fixed. Haven't herd from since we moved in. Very dissatisfied. Had I known it would be like this I never would have used them. We spoke with the agent a week after and never returned our phone calls. This is not the way we're used to conducting business. I hope most realtors are more professional than this.Thanks
