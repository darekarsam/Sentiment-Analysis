2	I will say this- I used to get breakfast here sometime and whoever wrapped the breakfast burritos was an artist-they were perfectly cylindrical, tight, and never came apart. It was kind of cool. Late nights though it's a different story. I used to work night at a store around there so I'd try to go get a coffee or something maybe some food-it took FOREVER for someone to ask me what I wanted. And it didn't matter what time I went there 11:30pm or 2 in the morning. I could never get the coffee I wanted at 2 cause their machine in "off" or "being cleaned"-so I started going earlier at like 11:30 and got the same excuse. I got pretty mad, there is no way it's off for that long-the night workers just didn't want to get off their bums so I'd go up the road to another McDonalds and get what I wanted there. It was just a big hassle.
3	I don't really expect a lot from fast food chains...as long as they are mostly clean I'm impressed....so this review will be short and sweet.The location is always busy but service is fast, the food is a hit or miss sometimes hot and fresh other times...warm at best...for a quick bite this place is fine but with more time, I'd go somewhere else.
3	Drive through experience was efficient and accurate today. A number one with a Diet Coke. And as I drove away, in my bag was the number one. Speedy and accurate.Hey, it's a billion calories and a ton of fat and sodium. But you know that already.
1	I have lived near this McDonald's for over 8 years, and sadly it has been a horrible experience for most of those 8 years.  After not visiting for the last 5 months, due to new eating habits, I stopped in last night to get a happy meal for my son.  While I did not know it was possible the service was actually worse then when I visited last, it actually was.  Spent 6 minutes between the payment window and actually getting my food, and on top of the very poor service and long wait, the mocha I purchased was actually burnt.
