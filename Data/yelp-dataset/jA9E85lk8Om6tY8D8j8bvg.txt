5	Took in a Meat cleaver and just a regular 8" kitchen knife.  You can shave with either of them, they even put a tip back on the 8" knife that had broken off!  and very inexpensive!!!!
5	Fast and friendly service with reasonable pricing. My french knife is now like a razor. Will take more over for them to work on. Plus they do garden tools and scissors. Its better than brand new knifes!
5	$15 to sharpen 5 knives - what an incredible deal.  I purchased Henkel Twin Pro S  knives and was a little disappointed when I used them out of the box.  The chef's knife is now cutting thin slices of fruit with ease and my meat cleaver went through chicken bones like it was butter.I will take my steak knives in next.
2	Not very sharp was not impressed for the price I thought it would be a better result of the sharpening. Ultimately the blades were weekend and I could no longer use two of the seven blades I gave them. However, they might be good for larger places just don't think they needed my small account so two stars to their defense but the overall quality of service was not for me.
