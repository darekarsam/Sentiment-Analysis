5	I have chronic knee issues and have been to numerous physical therapy offices as I've lived in various parts of the country. This is hands down the best place I've been. The staff is great, it's a family environment, the therapists are top notch, and you get treated exceptionally well every visit.
4	Staff is nice. Facilities are modest and clean. Location and hours are very convenient.
