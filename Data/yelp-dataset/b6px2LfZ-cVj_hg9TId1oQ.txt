3	Came in here for a much needed 5hr energy shot, was surprised at how big the place was.  The front of the store is the deli portion, the market items are in the back.  Everything is very organized and clean.  I made a mental note to myself to come back and try the deli items one day.  With Amelie's right next door, it's a hard sell to sit down and eat when you have a french bakery next door, but I've heard good things...
3	It's fine for convenience when with friends in the atrium and I'm not in the mood for Amelie's. I hear the deli sandwiches are really good and a good value. I haven't yet had the chance.
4	Steak and cheese is to die for. You have to be patient bc your order is going to take 20-30 mins regardless of how busy they are (or aren't). Have a beer, soda or glass of wine while you wait bc they sell it all. There is also a patio area out back. Enjoy!
1	First impression says a lot....Employee cooking food that was located right by the door wasn't what you call customer friendly. Then I asked her about one of their products and she says I don't know. If you work there you should know! Not too thrilled. I didn't buy anything from there either. Their onion rings looked good on a customers plate thought! I'd rather go to Penn Station!
4	Hole in the walk with some awesome fries!  I've read some of the reviews on here about the service being slow, which is true.  To their defense, they make the food as it is ordered.  My fries and chicken tenders always come out hot and crispy.  I love the fries and the tenders, but not a huge fan of the philly steak sub.  I've seen reviews ranting and raving about their sub, but those reviews must not have had a really philly.  Their philly is nothing close to a real philly.  I guess it would be more appropriate for some who was conscientious about their cholesterol issue?  Anyway, fries are DELISH!To be honest, the wait wasn't bad.  The prices are fair.
