5	Beautiful Fine Jewelry Store!  Sami Tekin and his Family are very Friendly!  I was impressed with how I noticed they were treating all of their customers!Beautiful pieces, they do Custom Design work and Repairs!Service IS Important when buying a piece of Fine Jewelry!  It is not like getting a cold Burger or some burnt fries!
5	Had such an wonderful experience at Ballantyne Jewelers!  They have a huge selection and the customer service was EXCELLENT.  It is family owned and each member of the Tekin family went above and beyond to ensure that I was taken care of.  There was no pressure and they were extremely helpful and knowledgable!  It is great to know there is a jeweler in town who will help you find what you want and work with you to stay within your price range.  Thanks to Sami and Aydin, I was able to trade in my old ring for an absolutely stunning upgrade.  They even customized it and sized it in less than an hour so that I could have it that day! I highly recommend them to everyone!  Thank you, Tekin family, for my beautiful ring...I love it!!
5	My custom multi-diamond set was beyond repair and needed to be re-made. I was very particular about who I chose to do the work. I was most impressed with Ballantyne Jewelers. They do their own work and the turn-around is very reasonable (much quicker than I expected!) Yuhan Tekin was very knowledgeable and had wonderful customer service. He assured me that my ring would be right and I couldn't be happier with the finished product! I will certainly use them in the future and send friends their way!  Although I didn't purchase a jewelry from their stock, they have BEAUTIFUL jewelry -- some of the most beautiful diamond rings I have ever seen!
