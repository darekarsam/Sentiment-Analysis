3	Strangely, I only ever seem to eat breakfast at this location.  The good news is that it gives me time to work it off throughout the day.  Not like I'm working out or anything, but it makes me feel better.I don't remember exactly when this store was built, but it is very nice on the inside - not your typical plastic style McDonald's, but a much nicer, more upscale look.  You won't confuse it for a Starbucks or anything (even with the McCafe stand inside), but it does have nice windows and a generally pleasing atmosphere.  The food is about the same, though!
2	i get alright service sometimes, then terrible at other times. I guess it depends n who is working and what time I go. I ordered a bacon egg cheese McGriddle got to work... opened the sandwich, and there was literally just the pancake pieces slapped together. No egg, bacon, or cheese... no sandwich, I probably could have cried if I had dwelled on it longer.
