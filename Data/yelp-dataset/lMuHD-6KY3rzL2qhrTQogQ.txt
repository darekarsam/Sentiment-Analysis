4	Great Staff!  Large Store, many booths - Open Sunday evenings I went yesterday about 5:00.  Closed Monday and Tuesdays (I've been those days too)!  You never know what you will find in a place like this!
4	Nice location, has a number of different items (good variety). Certainly more interesting than your general consignment shop. Prices range from reasonable on furniture to a bit high on collectibles. Probably due to being in town. Coin prices are high. The people there are nice.
