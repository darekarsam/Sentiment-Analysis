3	Hank's is a pretty decent eatery, but lacks any frills or excess, which exactly seems to be their goal. The hot dogs are definitely quality and compete with Dormont Dogs. Where they lack (and fail to Dormont Dogs) is the buns. While they are warm and steamed, they are just basic hot dog buns which do little to make the great dog become truly awesome. The price isn't bad ($2-2.50 each) for a basic hot dog. This isn't bad, but it's not much less than a more "trendy" hot dog shop in the city. With this being said, I will definitely be back. I only tried the hot dogs, and they were good, but there are many other options. You would think there would be several types of hot dogs, but there really only is 2-3 choices, surprisingly. Their hours could be better, too. I went there on a Saturday afternoon, but if I try to go enjoy a burger and fries after work, they are closed.Check them out!
3	Typical little hot dog shop.  Stand up counter for eating that is looking out the front window.Steamed buns are nice.  The buns came out of a Schwebel package.Homemade chili that is pretty good, if you want a chili dog.  Or you can try the everything dog or have it ur way.Fries are good and crisp. U can choose a natural cased dog as well.The women that owns the place was very friendly and responsive.
