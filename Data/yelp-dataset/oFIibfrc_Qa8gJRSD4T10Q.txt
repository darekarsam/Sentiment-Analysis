5	This subway just opened so everything is super clean. People behind the counter are friendly and quick. There is outside seating for interesting people watching.
5	This subway location is brand new and it's open until 10pm. Its a small subway, with four tables inside and three outdoor seating tables. Eveything is very clean. The sandwich bar is really fresh, no nasty lettuce and old tomatoes! I checked out the bathroom too and it was clean. The staff is really nice and friendly.This location is conveniently located right next to a Starbucks too. Right on the corner of Flamingo and Eastern. They did a nice job preparing my $4 lunch special black forest ham 6" sub. I will definately be back :-)
1	Have you ever "called" this location...??? I thought I had called an adult training school.... I really dont think they should let them answer the phone at all.... ugh....no good
4	Small location with 3 tables inside. Couple small tables outside. Located next door to Starbucks. Location gets pretty busy between 12 and 1. They speak Spanish for all you Spanish speakers. Pretty fast and good service. Bathroom inside will be locked. Jus ask the clerk to open the door for you. Subway has sandwiches, chopped salads and flatizza. They also have chicken noodle and cheddar broccoli soup everyday.. And don't forget the cookies!
