5	We could not be happier with our flooring or the entire process. Terry was great, and they used Beno's for the installation, who were fast, clean and did a really good job.
5	1st Choice Flooring did a great job installing laminate in our house.  Terry was very friendly and easy to deal with.  He explained the process of laying laminate floors and made sure we got a good product.  The price seemed reasonable and the installers were fantastic.  The have a close working relationship with Beno's Flooring and use them to perform the work.  I would gladly use 1st Choice for future flooring projects.
5	Terry was very helpful in helping us decide between laminates or carpeting.  He let us take home two full boards of samples and taught us to put them in different places at different times of the day so we could get the right look for us.  It was amazing at how different the hew's of carpets looked at different times and in those locations.  Their prices were competitive with large retail places.  Beco's was very professional, clean and did a wonderful job on the install.  There are no complaints.
5	After almost a year of shopping around for flooring, my husband and I finally decided we wanted tile throughout the house and new carpet for the bedrooms. We visited many places with nice sales associates, but... Terry, by far, blew away the competition! He was knowledgable and  stepped in with advice or general knowledge  just when we needed it. He made the whole process less scary! I got to take samples home and see how they would work in my house. And every time I came in with a question or concern before the install, he assured me. I recommend this company to anyone looking to install flooring!!
