5	I started going to David years ago when he was at Modern Salon before he and his (now) wife opened their own place above my naturopathic doctor in a cute house in Elizabeth, and now is on Providence.   He is both gentle and strong.  He helped me get through some really bad neck pain caused by stress and an improper bike fit, which on a triathlon bike can wreak havoc in such a low aggressive position.  He is generous with his time, is very zen, and just has a magical touch.  He seems to "read" body reactions very well and he understands physiology and psychology very well. They have a variety of treatments. Next time I'd like to try a wrap.I highly recommend David and think he is the best masseur in Charlotte. My only reason for not going to him on a regular basis?  Pure and simple: Budget.   When I'm a rock star, I'll have him on retainer.
5	Not only did David give an amazing deep tissue massage he also was able to provide pointers on how to help alieviate the pain every day. He followed up providing additional tips and links via email. I will definitely be using him again.
5	I have been working with David for nearly ten years. Skilled in his trade and customizes each session to your specific needs.
5	David is amazing! I've been having pain issues with my neck, shoulder and ankle for a long time. He spent considerable time, getting to know my pain issues, showed me several exercises to strengthen my muscles and talked with me through the session, explaining what he was doing and how the muscles relate to each other. I like that he made education a part of the therapy treatment by teaching me simple, effective methods that I can implement at home. For the first time in months, I can move my neck without pain and the 'knots' are gone. I've had massages before but David is a true professional, extremely knowledgable and seemed to find every kink. I highly recommend him!
