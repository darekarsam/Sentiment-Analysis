1	the other review on the page on this place is pretty funny because that was exactly what I was going to say.  Why did I eat that.  There are a lot of good Chinese restaurants here.   I was walking past,  it was easy and fast.  I started to eat it and kept thinking it would get better.  My stomach hurts.  That was not good food.  I should have thrown more of it away.
3	There are lots of choices here for a make your own noodle box. And the portion they give you is large, no one in our party could finish their box. The extras, peanuts, lime wedges, cilantro, etc. all cost extra so be wary of how many boxes you're ticking. You might end up with a much more expensive lunch than you had planned. For a quick place that serves OK Asian food go here. Especially if you like being in control of everything that goes into your meal. Otherwise, head up the street to Chinatown.
