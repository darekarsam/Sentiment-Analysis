4	Overall, my time here has been very pleasant. And, if there is need to speak with management, Chris G. is the guy I choose to go to. Well mannered, non-pretentious, and he seems to be about getting things done. I have also found Frances, and Chris W. to be friendly and helpful. These three seem to be a good team fo Chandler. Keep it up.
5	Since move in 2 months ago, I have spent more time at my community than any place besides work, I love it!. Conveniently located near grocery stores and shopping. The pool area is amazing! Fitness center is conveniently open 24 hours and grounds are always well kept. Chris Graves is always a pleasure to speak to and is always smiling, responsive and the neighborhood is safe. Overall, it's a great place to live!
5	Being in vegas for seven years chandler apartments are by far the best place I have lived. It has all the best amenities and the staff is incredible! Frances and Chris Graves always go above and beyond. I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking to live in the Southwest area.
1	Horrible experience and poor management.. I lived there for several months with no assigned parking, tiny gym, and kept experiencing different maintenance issues. Apartment was brand new but was told there was a water leak inside the kitchen walls, wall was torn apart and I had to live with a hole in the wall until they decided to repair it. Units have no elevators and several residents all had issues with ants. Pet owners did not clean up after their pets and there was a ton of construction.
5	Bill and Stacie in the leasing office were extremely helpful in getting our leasing situation figured out! They both were fun, professional, and patient. There was a bit of a misunderstanding with my current out of state apartment home, and Bill was able to get the situation resolved. We will be moving there next month and are looking forward to enjoying all Chandler has to offer. I will update this review as soon as we are settled!
