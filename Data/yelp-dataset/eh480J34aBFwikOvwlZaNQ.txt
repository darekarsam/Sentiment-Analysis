4	This is a really good Chinese, I first heard about them after being recommended to give it a try from a friend. I have never actually been there in person so can give no details on what the restaurant is actually like inside, but the food tastes great, and that's the most important thing.Me and a vegetarian friend found that there were plenty of options on their menu to be tempted by and I eventually opted for chicken chow mein and found that the dish was great and had lots of flavour to it. What's more is that it came with lots of vegetables, which made me feel justified in eating it all. The delivery time was quite long, taking about 40 minutes but the price was reasonable and would definitely order again from here.
