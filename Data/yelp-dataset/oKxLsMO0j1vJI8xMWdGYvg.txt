5	My primary care doc (Dr Khani) is in this medical group. She is an amazing person and medical professional. So satisfied with her hands on, caring approach to my health issues. Strong recommendation for Dr Khani if you're looking for a new doc. Waiting room gets quite crowded but there's six docs in this medical group. They accept walk-ins too.
2	Extremely incompetent staff. It took me a MONTH to get a prescription refilled because they either ignored the refill request from the pharmacy or sent it to the wrong pharmacy. This happened even after I went into the office. I am now sitting in a radiology facility waiting for a mammogram because CareMore said they would FAX them a referral 3 weeks ago and of course, did not. Also, I have never waited less than 30 minutes in CareMore's waiting room.  They always overbook.
3	I love dr Bertolli but I'm not sure that's enough to keep me coming here. The desk staff are nice enough and would be great if when they are talking bad about their patients that they did it in private .... That said the waits are horrible. My appt was at 9 it is now 1016 and still no dr. Once Bertolli comes in the wait is almost worth it. He's very pleasant and spends whatever to needed to explain any issues or questions you may have. That's why the times are so bad though!!!
5	We moved to Las Vegas 9 mos ago . We knew no one for referral for Doctors.  We moved from Tucson where many of our senior friends had Caremore as there Medicare supplement. All had nothing but good experiences with Caremore. My husband ,myself,and my 90 year old mother signed up. We have had a lot of medical issues and Caremore has addressed each one with the best of care. The have many preventive programs available for all members. I highly recommend Caremore to all seniors for their medical supplement  to Medicare.
