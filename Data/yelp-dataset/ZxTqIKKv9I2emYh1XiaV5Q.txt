4	Excellents pains. L'une des meilleures boulangeries dans le quartier Ahuntsic.
5	This place is dangerously close to my Pilates studio -- every week I risk undoing all my good work with one little bite. La Petite Boulangerie is an artisinal bakery with top-of-the-line pastries, breads, cheeses, and a variety of prepared dishes which make me drool on each visit. They are one of the bakeries which participated in le jour du croissant -- meaning their croissants are made the real French way with lots of butter and are fresh every day.I don't think I've ever had anything from here that I haven't loved, but my first love is the brioche toast topped with jam, then marzipan. Off today to get a fresh whole wheat miche so that my Thanksgiving turkey can be stuffed with delicious bready goodness.
