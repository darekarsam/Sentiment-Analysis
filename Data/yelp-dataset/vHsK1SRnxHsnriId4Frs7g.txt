2	If you are in a hurry, forget about it at this place. That is all I can say.
1	There's many other clinics to go to.  Dont waste your time.  Front desk service not the best.
1	Go somewhere else! Front desk girls have very nasty attitude toward patients and don't even know how to do their job as simple as scheduling appointments accurately. Average wait time 45min to 1hr.
1	As a new patient I expected to be treated with a little more respect. I waited for OVER two hours without seeing anyone, finally I just left. While I was in the outer waiting room, there were other patients complaining about how it is "always like this." I agree with the other reviews also, the front desk employees seemed both aloof and clueless, and not entirely helpful. Avoid this place, I recommend.
