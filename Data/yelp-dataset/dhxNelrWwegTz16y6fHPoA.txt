5	I had surgery November 2012 on my left ankle and 9 months later I still was struggling with scar tissue stiffness. Dr. Andrew Marone has been nothing short of miraculous with his A.R.T. Technique (active release technique) for soft tissue. I thought I would have to live with the discomfort of scar tissue for the rest of my life. After 7 treatments, 90% of the scar tissue is gone. I have had tendinitis in my lower legs and low back pain as well. Dr. Marone finds the trigger spots for the pain and applies a lot of pressure (hurts a lot during the release by the way) but is well worth the few seconds of pain for final relief of the chronic pain and scar tissue in my case. I can say that he truly cares about his patients too and how they are progressing. He also has been on time for his appointments. For all the above, I give him and his office the highest 5 star rating.
5	Love these guys! Not Only that they are amazing people, but they make you feel great after you leave them. The techniques they use are precise and they have you feeling like a new person!
5	Very professional and caring. I have had 3 appointments and I am seeing a difference in my pain level and my range of motion. If no one has been able to help you with your pain, give them at shot...you may be amazed! I will continue to see them with hope that I will keep improving.
5	I have had serious back issues for years. Nothing helped me at all! I was 35 when the pain started. Was recommended to them by a trainer and sent a friend instead who had a great experience so I went and it was amazing. These doctors actually care and take the time to speak with you and really understand your problem. Since I started I've had my back fixed, dislocated jaw (TMJ), sprained ankle and pulled groin.  The back was a super challenge and the fact I live without pain now is amazing. I have since sent several friends all extremely happy with results.
