1	Been there 3 times in 2 days been treated horrible.  Pass on this place & how they operate.1- They refused to honor their $1 off coupon on 2 occasions, then refused another coupon after they made the sandwich they said was good.   Complete morons and horrible service and treatment.  They switch to spanish and knew they were being even more rude.
2	Customer service is a hit or miss here, but most of my experiences have been bad. I came here once and the employee didn't wash their hands before making my sandwich. Ew.
1	If I could put negative -1 star I would, this place is beyond horrible. I ordered a chicken sandwich which gave me food poisoning. When I was at the drive-thru, I literally worried 20-30 mins that's what I could remember from when I started keeping tracking I probably stayed there longer.If I could back up and leave I would've but there were cars behind me. Recommend NOT to go.
