4	Stopped in here for some camera assistance during the protest.   They were so busy they forgot to lock the door at closing and people were still coming in.  They were very nice about it, worked with the customers and were very patient for us to finish our shopping and make our purchases.
5	The Camera Company is my go to source for camera equipment. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Dave is fantastic! He will never lead you the wrong way and is very helpful when it comes to buying what you really need. He's honest and doesn't try to make you purchase unnecessary equipment.
5	I really like this store. Their staff is super knowledgeable and has been really helpful to me as I learn "fancy" photography while not being snooty to me for being a novice.  Their prices are standard, so you usually pay what you'd pay at Amazon (if you bought new). I haven't bought any used equipment there or had anything printed, so I am just referring to buying lenses and getting advice from them. Not voting on their price 'cause photography is an expensive hobby!
