4	The Veggie Collard Wrap was wow!!!! So yummy. Tons of healthy options. I had the Green juice, hubby had the Energy. They were alright, but not the best I've had. The wrap was certainly a 5 star, but the juice wasn't as 'vegetabley' as I'd like.
4	Great customer service with knowledgable staff that patiently explained the menu to several people who looked confused. I had my grain bowl and smoothie within five minutes after ordering. This is a must stop for healthy-minded people on the go!
3	Okay, don't kick me in the groin for this mediocre review. My first trip to GrabbeGreen was orgasmic--I couldn't get enough of the French Quarter. It was one of those meals where you lick the box then take it out for a smoke. Yes, I'll admit the portions were small for my appetite, but maybe portion control is something I need to grasp. The second try was epically disappointing. The Moroccan mac and cheese with chicken. With a detox juice, because I'm mad about beets! Now, let me just put this out there: I make a wicked good mac and cheese. And it's probably a full 2,000 calories per serving. So, I'm particular about this dish. Let me also say that I don't like white meat. The marriage of this pasta with chicken breast just wasn't for me. At all. Dry meat and the spices were more on the sweet side. Hey, maybe I've never had a proper Moroccan mac and cheese and this is how it was supposed to be. But after nearly dropping a Jackson on this meal, I was left feeling empty. Like I was just dumped after ordering appetizers. I will be back. Definitely for the French Quarter. And for sure after my next bender to flush my system.
