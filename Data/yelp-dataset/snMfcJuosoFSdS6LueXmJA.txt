2	China Grill is a very run of the mill 'Westernized' Chinese restaurant. It is similar in to Chine Toque which is located down the street, but I feel that China Grill has better food. With all the great Asian restaurants in the Concordia ghetto area (which seem to be spreading westward) I think that there are many better options relatively near by. However, if you work in the neighbourhood and are pressed for time I would certainly recommend China Grill over Chine Toque.
3	Okay food.
3	Run of the mill Chinese. Decor is good and the bright. Nothing to special mention. Service is ok more towards cold. Price is $$
3	Location is convenient. Food is good but not great. The service is spotty.
4	Garlic pepper squid is spicy and amazing. General Tao is nothing special. Curries are great. Worth going and not too expensive.
