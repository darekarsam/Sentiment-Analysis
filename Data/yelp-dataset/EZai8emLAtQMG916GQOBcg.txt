3	Been years since I've been here decent work for cheap..3 stars cause that phoenix summer is brutal and you're out in it while they work on your ride!
5	Great service quality work . Shaded waiting area with cooler . Cheapest price in town.
4	Great window tint place! I have been coming here for 5+ years and i have brought 7+ cars! Not including the amount of referrals i have made to them! They are cheap fast and tell you the amount of time to wait with the cars in the shop! I gave them 4 stars because you have to wait out in a shaded area while they work on your car to be ready! But it is worth the wait for the price! All cars that i have taken they charged me $90 and that included any shade that you want, and a 2 year warranty! (For any small damages or bubbles that may occur). For the tints they offer 35%( AZ state legal) on top of that they also offer 25%, 20% and the most popular one for this heat 5% which is what is known as (Limousine Tint). Here in Arizona you are allowed to have 5% all around your car, BUT the two front window must be 35%! You can risk it and get something darker but incase you get pulled over you might get fined!   I have a small Toyota Yaris hatchback and they took 45min- 1hour , and they estimated me 1:30 min ! Which is great! I will keep coming here but one thing that must improve is the coustomer waiting area with clean chairs and cooler waiting area(since this heat is brutal). But other than that great place especially for the price!
