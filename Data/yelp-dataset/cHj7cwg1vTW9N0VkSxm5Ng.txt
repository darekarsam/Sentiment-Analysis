5	located in the village, this unassuming vietnamese restaurant offers a taste of what most vietnamese eat at home. the kind of flavorful food i grew up on. it's that good!the pho broth is packed with goodness, richness, depth. different flavors profile that all combine together for one heck of an intense flavorful pho. like my mom said: "well, shit. this is as good as mine. i'm not making pho anymore." even though i agree with her assessment, it pains me when she said it as it's not only about the broth but the aroma filling the house when you make pho that makes you glee.and bun bo hue. only available on friday but oh my! intense and quite a spicy broth. your sweat glands will be on overdrive as well as your nose!they have one of my favorite, chao tom (sugarcane shrimp or a shrimp lollipop if you want). grilled ground shrimp on a sugarcane that you munch on afterwards. it sure is a crowd pleaser.they have fried ice cream, which i haven't tried, and che ba mau (3 color pudding) which is always a delight. i did spot cocktail drinks which is a bit odd as we're not known to be liquor/cocktail drinkers.price is around the same as every vietnamese restaurant in town (on the inexpensive bracket)only thing missing would be delivery

The pho was pretty damn decent, and I'm not even that hungry. Really just killing time. Solid broth. Good all around pho. And the prices were great for what you get. Fun fact: I actually wrote this before I even ate the food. I just had a hunch, then ate, then pressed "continue." When you know, you know.
5	Tasty, simple food.  Quick service, good price, nice little place.And Yelp is ridiculous in that it won't let me post a short review. If I don't want to write a long winded review I should not be forced to!
