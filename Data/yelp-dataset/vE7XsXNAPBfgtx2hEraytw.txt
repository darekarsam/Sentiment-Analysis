4	I need new shoes! DAMNIT!! The sales associate was actually super helpful and friendly and brought out TONS of shoes foe me to try on. I finally settled on a pair and he informed me I can wear these for two months and if I'm not completely comfortably satisfied I can RETURN them! Total score.
5	I have been using these shoes for years and there is no doubt that they are fabulous! If they don't fit right, you are able to return them within two months. My five stars goes to Cisco who has ALWAYS given the most outstanding customer service, which is definitely hard to come by these days. A true gentleman with superior worth ethics. As a business owner, I look for these qualities in a worker. He is one big reason that I will continue to invest in Shoes for Crews. Thank you for your product and your service.
1	Horrible shoes!  Bad quality , they are extremely uncomfortable.  Theu are fine the first month or so anf they the glue starts coming apart. Yes they have the 2 month return but I figured it was not big of a deal but now theres a hole in my shoe , I go home w so much foot pain . I ended up buying better quality shoes elsewhere .
