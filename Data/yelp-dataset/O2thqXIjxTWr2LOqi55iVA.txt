1	New pumps that take way to long to pump gas! Took 15 minutes for my 16 gallon car! Long lines does not mean good prices! Means extremely slow pumps
3	Go to SC to buy your gas, it's cheaper than Charlotte. This is not as cheap as going down to Rock Hill. I buy  gas here and sometimes use the car wash.
3	Gas Station south of the border.
