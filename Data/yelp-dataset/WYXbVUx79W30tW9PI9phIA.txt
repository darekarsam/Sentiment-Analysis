4	I had to stop here recently to have my rim fixed.( Flat tire and bent rim!) The guys working there were excellent. Very friendly and extremely efficient. I was in and out of there in less than a half hour. And while i was expecting to get ripped off, i was pleasantly surprised when it only cost a few dollars. They definitely have my business.
5	Went here Thursday for a car inspection after 6pm and they were very helpful! Not to mention friendly. They also gave me pricing on things I may need in the future. I will be going to this location again.
