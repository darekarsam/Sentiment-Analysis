5	This place has the best Mexican food ever! Their food is awesome, healthy, and very fresh. If you haven't tried it you are missing out.
4	Carne Asada Tacos (no gristle) for $1.25. They even throw some chips and beans on your plate for free.The BEST, FREE Salsa bar in this neighborhood (check Sonny's pic if you don't trust me). Jump my gringo ass into this gang, esse. This place is da bomb!!!
4	I almost don't want to leave a review cause the place is already busy and it doesn't need carloads of Yelpsters from Summerlin but I think it deserves the praise! Best Mexican beef soup in town....$5.99Best Agua Frescas (especially the Cantelope) $1.50The service is always fast and efficient...especially if Jasmin is working the counter! And I can grab some groceries on my way out.....highly recommended
