3	Quick, simple. Sometimes parking can be tight.... Located in a strip mall. The car was ready when I needed it and they picked me up from the hotel.
1	The worst experience I have ever had at an Enterprise location.  My 80 y/o mother made a reservation, so we could go to Cali for my father services.  When we went to pick up the car, the older blond lady was very rude to my mother.  She first didn't have the car size we reserved, then got upset that we wanted the larger car at same price.  We asked at time of reservation what we needed to bring with us, but when we got there she demanded other paperwork that she never mentioned.  She refused to hold the larger car (only car available at location) while we went to get paperwork.  We left and contacted another location (Camelback and 27th Ave), who was very helpful with our rental. I would never recommend this location (75th Ave and Thomas) to anybody.
