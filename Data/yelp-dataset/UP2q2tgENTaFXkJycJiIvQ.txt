5	I was very impressed with Mariscos Culiacan!This AUTHENTIC Mexican food/seafood, not just another knock off Filibertos.  I had a Pescado Entero (Whole Fish, Fried), and it was fantastic!  My brother had the Carne Asada Plate, and I can say that the meat was actually grilled, not pan fried like so many places.  I would highly recommend it!
4	OOB - Replaced with Bahia De Guaymas.
