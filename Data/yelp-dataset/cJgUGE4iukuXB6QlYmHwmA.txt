2	I'm use to really good Greek food, ie the Greek food festival on the north shore and Sams Sun in Carrick and let's just say this was not up to par.  I can here with my boyfriend and parents once we realized that you cannot eat inside the Real McCoy in the south side. I ordered my standard, chicken gryo and fries. Well, it was ok-ish. I think it would have been much better if I had had a few drinks. They are open late, which is great, but overall I'm not a huge fan. My gryo didn't have enough cucumber sauce in my opinion was it was a little dry. My boyfriend ordered his standard, Falafel which was just ok in his opinion. My father ordered a gyro burrito which is just strange in my mind, he liked it however. I don't think I'll be a repeat customer here.

The specialty here is shish kabob and I would recommend the lamb even though they kebab all types of meat.  The salad that comes with dinner is awesome thanks to the herby Greek dressing they use.  My only complaint was that the baklava was tough to cut through and I need a knife to do it.  Prices are higher than most Greek establishments but the interior is all new and service is prompt.
