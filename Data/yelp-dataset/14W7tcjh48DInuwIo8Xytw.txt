3	We have used Target Optical on and off over the years depending upon our insurance coverage. In the beginning, I was very skeptical about using a eye doctor in a clothing/food retailer but in the end they won me over with their service and prices. Nice job!
2	Used this location for my optometry needs for last 4 years.  Good optometrist, good staff in the past.  However, my last 2 visits have been sub-par, particularly concerning the staff.  They were surly, gave me grief about the fact I didn't come back for 3 months after picking up my trial contacts (I was busy).  And it took them 30 minutes to figure out my insurance payment, they asked me for my insurance number, which hasn't changed for 10 years and they've charged against it a dozen times for my wife and me.  I'm done with this location...
5	KUDOS to RAMSEN ODISHO for consistently providing excellent professional service! He is worthy and should be recognized for going beyond to provide his clients with quality optical services. Helen B.
