4	How much I love to hang in this spice store. There is a shelf with jars full of seeds, and another one with jars full of teas, and shelf  with spices, and shelf with grains, and another one with dried fruits, and one more with nuts and another with sweet delights, and the store always has my beloved wasabi peas, and you can put what you want in little plastic bags and leave happy that you have spent some enjoyable minutes smelling and sensing the diversity of this spice heaven.
