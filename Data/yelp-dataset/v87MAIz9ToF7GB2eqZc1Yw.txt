3	It was my first time trying Moroccan food and since it was halal, I was excited to try it out. I got slightly disappointed by their food. It wasn't that great but at least I got to try tajine. However, I liked the ambience. We actually had a great time there. We chose their group menu, so got to try a lot of their dishes. You can bring your own wine or if you don't drink alcohol, then you can bring sparkling juice like I did lolYou can read my full review along with pictures on my blog: http://arzanrestos.blogspot.ca/2014/03/menthe-et-couscous.html
5	I'm not sure why this place doesn't have a five star average. Rarely can we find places that offers A refreshingly original culinary Avenue for those, who just as me, are tired of always eating the same old traditional Italian/Asian/western food. I had the best Lamb tagine that I ever had in Montreal. The meat was so moist that I literally felt it was melting in my mouth. I think it's also really great that the meet is all halal as this is the only type of meat that I eat.
