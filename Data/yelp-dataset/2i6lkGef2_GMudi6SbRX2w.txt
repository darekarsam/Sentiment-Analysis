5	My wife and I have both been seeing Dr. Segal for over five years.  He's great, one of the best chiropractors I've seen over the years and I strongly recommend him to everybody we know.  I've had regular chiropractic care since my late teens, not just for injuries, but also maintenance.  Dr. Segal has been excellent about tailoring treatment and frequency to what is going on.  No sales pitch for extras, just a good assessment and focused manipulation.  From someone who puts a lot of stress on my neck and back through work and play, this is a great place to go.
5	Dr. Seagle is wonderful. My whole family goes to him. The amazing feeling of instant Relief that I get every time I hear that pop, is amazing. I have been to chiropractors all over the world. None of them to the success  of Dr. Seagle. I used to have chronic migraines daily. Would go a few times a week. After continual visits for years. I am happy to report I rarely get migraines and only need to visit every couple of month. This man knows what he is doing!
1	Dr. Eric Segal was a complete ass. He was rude and obnoxious to me and my wife. We went to him for an adjustment and I left wanting to adjust this idiot's face. I will deter all of my clients from going here and will personally make sure that this man doesn't disrespect anyone else like he did to us.
