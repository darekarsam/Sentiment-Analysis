4	Pretty darn good. The bagels are really good and the coffee (they roast their own, BTW) is great!! My only criticism is they need to put more cream cheese on the bagels. Honestly..... just filling the pores of the cut bagel with cream cheese is NOT a schmear!!!!!  I really liked the cheddar bagels. You can tell the owner (a VERY nice fellow, BTW) really wants this place to fly and I hope it does. The decor is pretty decent with various artwork (that's for sale) hanging all about the walls and a separate "reading-room" type of area that has a couch, coffee table, and easy-chair. Yeah... I'll go back!  Oh.... FREE WiFi too!!! :-)
4	SECOND VISIT:Coffee still wonderful, bagels still great (more cream cheese this time, BTW), owner(s) still friendly and helpful. Yep.... I'll be back again!!!BTW - Those of you who want to use the free WiFi, just ask at the counter for the log-in security code (WEP key). I ran a speed check and it was downloading at a BLAZING 4+ Mbps!!!   8^D
3	good place to get your coffee if you want to support small biz.  And yes, more cream cheese this is America, we want more of what makes us fat.Go visit them.  Thanks for reading.
4	If you like bagels you have to try Sunrise! No preservatives added. Absolutely THE BEST bagels in the Valley. Family run. Try the jalapeno cheddar with jalapeno cream cheese.
5	My husband and I recently went to Sunrise for the 1st time and the experience was fantastic. The customer service was spot on & the food was delicious. We both tried what each other ordered & agreed we would love to come back. Thank you Sunrise for making our 1st time, a great time. We will absolutely be returning soon.
1	I stopped by here today (08/20/11) and the store was closed with a real-estate management sign stating it was "For Lease" in the window. Too bad!!! They had good food and coffee. :^(
