3	Service is pretty fast, and the chicken legs are always well cooked. The meat is very moist and tender and full of flavor.This restaurant does not offer any waiter service, so just bring your plate to the station after you're done.
2	I ordered the fruit and goat cheese salad.  It left a lot to be desired, especially considering the 15$ it costs. I had to request dressing because it came out dry, and despite the large plate,  it was not very full. The toppings were interesting (dried fig), but they were all a little sparse. I walked out very unsatisfied. On the plus side, service was great (friendly and prompt), but even it couldn't overcome the lackluster food. I won't be coming back.
1	Worst service ever - very unpleasant dining experience.This local S-Hubert should be ashamed to try to overcharge the customer even before treating customers like inferiors.
