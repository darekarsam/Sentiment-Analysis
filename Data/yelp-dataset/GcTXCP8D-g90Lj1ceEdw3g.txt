5	Katrina has been my stylist for the past 3 years now. When I first came to Katrina, my hair was in horrible condition. Now my hair is strong and full thanks to the care that Katrina takes in maintaining its health. Very professional and extremely friendly, I always have a great time at Treatment Salon.
5	I have been getting my hair done here for 7 years. My health hair journey has been a rocky on from being relaxed to natural back to relaxed but during the whole process Katrina has been a major part of getting my hair back where it needs to be. Her hair cuts are so AMAZING and she is the ONLY one that i will let near my hair with scissors.  My hair always turns out the way i want it... it soft, easy to manage and beautiful every time i leave... You gotta love a great stylist.
4	After a quick check online and Yelp this place seemed like the perfect spot to fix my natural hair. The first thing that I loved was that they allow you it make appointments online. This is super convenient, especially for our busy schedules. The salon is small and only has three stylist. But don't fret there is NO double or triple booking here. I made my appointment with LaRhea. She was waiting for me when I arrived, listened to my concerns, offered suggestions and did a fabulous job with my hair. They offer discounts with multiple visits AND you can use you credit/debit card. Yes! I can't wait to come back!
5	I was referred to treatment salon by my girlfriend, I was looking for a salon since moving to Charlotte from Los Angeles. I had very specific requirements  about finding a stylist with hair care as a primary concern. Once I tried Katrina  I was extremely happy with the feel and style of my hair including the high quality products she incorporated in my hair. Katrina was personable, prompt  and informative about hair care.  Trust me you will not regret your experience !
