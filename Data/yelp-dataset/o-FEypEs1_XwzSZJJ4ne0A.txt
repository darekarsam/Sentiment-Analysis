3	i love their selection!, their baked goods are generally good (avoid chocolatine or croissant, they taste like DAYS old!! anything else is good)  some of the imported items are nice too...the packaged meals are not good though, so only buy them for convenience.  Dont buy anything that you find in a regular grocery store since here the prices are steep even  you typical milk brand is overpriced.
4	A superb store with polite, knowledgeable personnel and a great selection. No need to wade through Jean-Talon Market or Atwater Market. Sometimes they are bit too pricey, and prepared foods are sometimes just a shade too spicy, but still excellent.
4	All you need to know is that they sell my brand of Italian olives and therefore, this makes Alexis great! (=-DLocation: On St. Jacques next to Nora Gray. Parking isn't usually an issue and if you're in the downtown core and enjoy walking, you can easily get there on foot. Otherwise, the closest subway is probably Lucien-L'Allier. Stuff: In addition to the most fabulous olives EVER, they carry a pretty wide variety of eats, ranging from charcuterie and cheeses to tea/coffee and gigantic tubs of Nutella (6 pounds, people - you can feed your kid for a whole year on that thing). They have a small section dedicated to 'international' stuff, like chutneys, spices etc. and a large dairy section where you can find water buffalo yogurt if that suits your fancy. Price: I think it depends on what you buy. It's a bit of a 'boutique' grocer so some items are going to be more expensive. That being said, my gigantic jar of olives was $9.99 which is perfectly acceptable given the size of the thing. What can I say? I love olives. Great little shop - worth the detour.
4	Charming little neighborhood market. Nice selection, attractive space, friendly staff.
