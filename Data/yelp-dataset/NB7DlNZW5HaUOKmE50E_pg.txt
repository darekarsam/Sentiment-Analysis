5	If you want excellent chicken, marinaded in the sweetest of sauces, Frango is the place. The prices are fair (between $10-$20) and if you get a chance, order the potatoes. They are absolutely to die for!!! For the people who say Romados has better chicken, well firstly Frango's chicken is great and second, you can't get a seat at Romados. Frango has tables to eat in comfort whereas Romados is based around takeout. Plus I prefer not to wait in long lines for comparable chicken.  Ive eaten there twice so far and always walk away as a happy customer.
2	Got it delivered. Chicken was dry, and some of the potatoes were as well. Salad is completely uninspired. I wouldn't order again considering how many better options there are on the Plateau for authentic Portuguese chicken.
