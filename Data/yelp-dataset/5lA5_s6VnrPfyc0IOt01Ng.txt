4	Nestled in NoDa, Vivian B boutique shines like a little penny. It's a small space but showcases some nice brands, very sweet service and fills a void of mid-range retail that (in my opinion) many neighborhoods are missing. For those who are driving here, I *think* you can park in the lot behind the store (I did), but be sure to read all the signs before doing so! The Good: It's bright, it's airy, it's clean and you'll find a handful of great brands like Ali Ro, BCBG, Line and Dot, Voluspa candles and more. The style is modern with a bit of an edge - I spied pretty dresses, silk shorts, a few pairs of jeggings on the back wall and a bright, airy tops. Price points range from $50-$180 and the staff are quite friendly and laid back. They also offer wine and beer while you're walkin' around perusing the styles. Nice!  The Meh: They only carry 3 or 4 of one particular style - this is both good and bad. Good - only a couple of folks have that style, Bad - if your size is out of stock. I think they have room to add more styles, lines, and accessories, which would be much appreciated for those who really like selection (but I know how tough that is for a small shop to handle extra inventory). Vivian B is definitely worth a stop if you're shoppin' around in NoDa!

I'm a real fan of their jewelry and art pieces, as well as their scent items, and though their clothing selection is small, it's very sharply curated. The owner named the shop after her grandmother, whose portrait presides over the shop like some kind of stylish saint.
4	The space quite small (and the clothing sizes) but the service was friendly. They also had a nice selection of jewelry. Recommended for ladies looking for a one of a kind piece (or maybe three of a kind). Check out their website for more style options.
