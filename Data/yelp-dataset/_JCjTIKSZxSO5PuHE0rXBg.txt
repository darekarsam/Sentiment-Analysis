4	Sometimes you have to meet people when you are out and about.  Maybe it's something social that needs everyone (or maybe just two) to get together.  Maybe it's something business related that needs all parties at the table at a neutral place.  And maybe it's just bunch of family members getting together after some functions.When I think about meeting people, I think about Williams.It's big and as for my experience, there's always a table waiting for you.  There's a free Wireless Internet hotspot available for you to surf the web while you're waiting for the inevitable straggler in your group to arrive.  The staff  here is always ready to serve you from their large menu of beverages, treats, and meals, there's bound to be something for everyone's taste.As a customer of this Williams I would say that I am a fan!
