5	Donna is an excellent teacher. She gives just the right amount of instruction and makes learning to sew a fun experience. As an added plus, her rates are very reasonable.
5	Donna is such a fabulous instructor! She went out of her way to set up shop in my home, which was so convenient. She explained all the ins and outs of sewing that I've been trying to figure out for so long on my own. If you're looking for the best sewing instructor in Vegas, you've found her!
5	My girlfriend and I wanted to learn how to sew and stumbled upon Donna online. She is a great instructor and also very fun and flexible. We thoroughly enjoyed our time with her and learned everything there is to know about sewing! She even went to the store with us and helped us pick out our machines, tools, and supplies!
5	Donna is an excellent teacher and person! I contacted her via e-mail for help on a project and she responded back within hours, very responsive. It was so nice to have her come to my home and give me solid one-on-one time, which was exactly what I needed as a group class environment would not have cut it. On top of addressing the issue I was having with my project and as I am a beginner to sewing, she went over sewing machine 101 basics and also had me make a zippered pillow cover, which was great as I had only done envelope pillow covers before. The pillow turned out great an I love the zipper closure! On top of it all Donna has a bright and funny personality which makes working with a lot of fun!
