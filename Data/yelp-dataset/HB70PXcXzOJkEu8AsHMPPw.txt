5	My fiance and I went in after work one day to catch happy hour and were pleasantly surprised! This gem of a Mexican spot has 99 cent Margaritas and other drinks Mon-Friday 3:00-7:00 p.m. They also have a reverse happy hour 9:00-Close. We had Aaron taking care of us and he was such a great guy. Great spirit, very positive, and wasn't mad we were only ordering drinks. (Cheap Ones) and an appetizer. Appetizer's are half off during Happy Hour as well. :) We had the Queso Fundido and it came out flaming. It was a fun touch and made it memorable. It was yummy and spicy and AMAZING. The margaritas were very tasty and strong as well. :)Marilyn the manager was such a kind hearted and thoughtful person. We talked to her a few times while we were there. She took the time to make sure we were ok, which to us is UNHEARD of in other places in the surrounding area.We overall had a great experience and feel like Aaron and Marilyn went above and beyond for us and we will definitely be back.I definitely think this place would be a great first date spot as well. :)
1	Awful food and service.  Waiter kept calling me "chief."  Chips are good but food quality and temperature were very poor. Really disappointing
1	The food was great, once we FINALLY got service!!! I had to go to the front desk and ask for a server, then another in our party went to the front desk to ask for a server. When we finally did get to order, it took at least a half hour before our food came.
