4	Pauley Potato is moderately famous for being the scene of a television show, but I want to talk about their Spruce Beer. The clear, non-alcoholic soda in it's own labeled bottles smells atrocious, and tastes moderately good. It's an experience, and probably worth the trip. The poutine is passable (is there any bad poutine, really?), and other items are not necessarily greasy spoon, but definitely a Montreal that Americans don't go. That's cool. I think there was a picture of Celine Dion in there.
2	Overpriced, bland food. I've had a cheeseburger there three times and every one made me sick. The only good thing they have is the breakfast sandwich, but I wouldn't make a special trip for it.
4	In a world of over-polished poutine chains the old school, casse croute family holdouts own my soul. Keep your crazy hours, Paul Patate, just also keep your perfect fries, your best in the land homemade biere d'epinette, your funny friendly quick on the draw staff, and all the proud history of your time in Pointe St Charles papering the walls.Personally, the poutine gravy here isn't my absolute favourite, but maybe it's made to balance perfectly with the white vinegar in squeeze bottles on every table. Because get that all over a Paul Patates poutine then try to tell me you are not in pure poutine heaven.
4	The poutine here is simply amazing. But my negative point? It's pricey for a fast food restaurant.
1	After enjoying the spruce soda made at Paul Patates, I was very hopefully to visit the place for a fresh soda and a meal. Unfortunately, the restaurant was closed more than hour before it is supposed to close and I did not get to enter even though I arrived well within the time frame that the business advertises its open hours.
