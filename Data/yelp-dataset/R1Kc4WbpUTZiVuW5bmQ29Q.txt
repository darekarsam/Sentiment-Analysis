4	A good luncheonette. The roast beef and pork sandwiches is amazing! They try to be as organic and "make it themselves" as possible.
5	Great sandwiches with good portion of salads. Really fresh. Friendly customer service. Definitely worth to come back again for lunch or brunch on a weekend.
4	My favorite  downtown lunch spot to get a friendly yet sophisticated foodie escape without breaking your $$ or time budgets. They use top ingredients.  You can even find duck confit on the menu. Too bad it's not open on the wknd or for dinner.  I've often dreamt about owning a small gem cafe.  They would be on top of my Montreal list.
