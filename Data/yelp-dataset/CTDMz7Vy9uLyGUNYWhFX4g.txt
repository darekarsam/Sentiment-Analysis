4	I used to work at subway and I am very picky about my sandwiches, unfortunately. This subway is one of the only ones that makes appetizing sandwiches. They were a little distracted when I went but my sandwich was perfect and thats all that masters to me! Kudos!
3	We have only be to this store for their breakfast offerings.  This was our first visit.  The breakfast sandwiches were fine.  Definitely better than a Mc-anything or similar offerings from other fast-food joints.  Price was reasonable.  There was only one person on the counter, so it was a bit slower than normal for a Subway.If in need of a quick breakfast at a reasonable price, this is an ok place to come.
4	Its just a subway but I like this location.  The staff is great and always welcomes us when we walk in.  They are quick even when a moron orders five sandwiches to go and is relying on their memory instead of having it written down.  And no, I am not the moron lol.
1	See my tip! Subway just sucks. They are cheap and want to charge for extra ingredients! How about putting on a fair amount of ingredients in the first place!
3	I went to this location today during my lunch break. When I entered I was greeted by the staff. Their greeting was probably the worst I have ever received from walking into a Subway. It seemed very forced, with no heart, and extremely unwelcoming. I only got the impression that they hated having to greet guest and thought it would have been a lot more pleasant if they hadn't said anything at all. Either than their half hearted greeting, the staff was nice. The girl that made my sub did an excellent job. The taste of food was alright, typical cheap Subway quality. The store was very clean! Overall, my experience was alright. Would have gave 4 stars if their greeting wasn't so weak.
