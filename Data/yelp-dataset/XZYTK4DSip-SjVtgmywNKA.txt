5	This fabulous boutique was one of our favorites during our trip to Montreal. Great labels/designers. INCREDIBLY helpful staff (thanks for the tips Meghan!) and lovely space. Great for guys and gals. A must check out.
3	Decent sale going on. Nice jewelry for the ladies. Not sure what there was here for guys except for a sofa.
4	Although I have yet to visit here, I'm absolutely in love with it. The website is easy to navigate, the customer service is outstanding.  I was doing some research for my upcoming visit (we finally have free time this time around) and came across this website.  I emailed the store about shipping to the US (which they do for $20!!) and about items not listed on the website (see their blog).Melanie graciously added the items to my order and within a week (yesterday), I recieved my package. The packing of the items was adorable. The reciept came in a black envelope, necklaces packed in a lovely paper bag and box and my shirt was wrapped in a electric yellow wrap.  And also enclosed with a unicorn charm!! /endgirlishswoonYou may ask why I ordered online if I'm going up, well I wanted to sample items before making time on my one free day to visit.....this is a definite stop for me. And from this, I will definitely be ordering from again soon. So until my visit on Halloween, this cute place won't get 5 stars (just yet!!).
4	This is an excellent little spot to check out if you are looking for tasteful women's clothes by local and international designers for around 50-200$. Everything here is hand selected by the owner, and the clothes reflect her chic taste. When you see those elegant Montreal women wearing layers of je ne sait quoi sexy soft basics with a twist, they are probably wearing something from Unicorn. Lots of black and grey, gorgeous soft t-shirts and sweaters in unconventional shapes, and the lovely decor makes you feel like taking your time. Great spot to find jewelery gifts and don't forget to check out the sale section in the back.
