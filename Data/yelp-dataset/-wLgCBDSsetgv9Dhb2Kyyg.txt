5	I went to Nina when she was at Brazilians and Brows which she recently left. I would follow her wherever she went. Besides being beyond words sweet, she is a true professional who won't let you leave until  everything is perfect.I highly recommend Nina!
5	I have been a client of Nina's for 3 years now! She is the absolute best in the business. She is attentive, extremely accommodating, friendly, affordable, punctual, and so knowledgable about skin care. I would never go anywhere else for a waxing service!!!
5	Absolutely amazing!!! Nina is professional, fast, very clean and very friendly!! It was a pleasure to be her client and will definatly be referring all my girlfriends to her!!
5	I have been following Nina around the Las Vegas Valley for all of my waxing needs for the last 4.5 years. She makes you feel so comfortable, and her work is flawless. Best brows, painless technique, and truly cares about her clients. I recommend her to everyone that even hints at needing hair removal. If you go to Nina, you will never want another aesthetician.
