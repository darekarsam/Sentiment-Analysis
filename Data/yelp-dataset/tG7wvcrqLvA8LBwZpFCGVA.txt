1	I live down the street from this Fry's and I will not be returning.
5	The woman who runs the deli, Rose, is fantastic. Went in looking for a specific type of cheese and when I couldn't find it I asked for her help. She told me that they usually only carry it during the holidays but she would be happy to order it for me. Came back the next day and there it was! Talk about customer service!
5	Always friendly and helpful people at this location  my favorite frys to visit. I always find awesome parking and can go in and out of the store quickly! Jennifer is especially helpful I always look to see if she is working!!
3	I'm not a fan of Fry's....let me just throw that out there. That fact doesn't stop me from going there if I absolutely must (those stupid SRP payment machines thankyouverymuch).My first and only trip to this location was pretty quick, so my experience only involves about half the store. I knew what I needed and was able to find everything easily. The layout of the store is a little annoying (you walk into the exit for the registers, produce is in the back of the store)...I just don't quite understand the flow. If you walk in and veer to the right, there is a dollar section on your right hand side. There were a lot of employees working in all areas of the store and everyone was friendly. For a Sunday afternoon the store was crowded but it was easy to shop and we had no wait when we got to the registers.As far as prices go, I don't find Fry's to be any less expensive than their competitors . Nothing stands out as extraordinary so I probably wouldn't seek this store out for any one particular thing. If I am in the area and need to put money on that dumb SRP card and need a loaf of bread, I would get it here, otherwise I would just go to one of my other regular shopping spots.
