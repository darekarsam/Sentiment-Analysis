3	This store has many cheap, good deals. However, after many many visits, I have noticed that the staff is not the most polite, and they basically completely ignore you, sometimes even when you're trying to pay. I think out of the 10+ times I've been there, I have only met two nice salespeople :/
4	I like this store they sale tons and tons of sexy panties for $1 buck call it trashy, I call it a great deal.  They are sold in those giant bins. Think Walmart 2.99 DVD bins, you get the idea but if you have the patient to hunt elbow deep you can find some super cute knickers.On one occasion I purchased an Aztec print book bag purse with a snap that was a little unstable for my comfort. The book bag purse would open while it was on my back.  I returned it to the store with no fuss Rue 21 gladly accepted the defected item back.Also Rue 21 sales men's clothing too.
2	Oh Rue 21...On the one hand, walking around this shop is always a fun way to pass the time. Things in here are always very cute, I won't lie; often as I walk I'll pick up a few things I wouldn't mind trying on......and by the end of my lap around the store, I'll almost always return what I pick up without actually trying it on. Why? Well, because on second inspection I realize and remind myself, oh yeah: this clothing is just not for me anymore.Yes the stuff here is cheap, which is great if you're a young student shopping for the latest trends. I, however, do not have a good track record with Rue21. Not only have items I've purchased become a bit uncomfortable after a couple wears, I've had items rip within a couple months if not days after buying them; heck, I've found broken jewelry and torn clothes as I'm walking around the store itself.But I get it: sometimes you just have to buy that really cute top or pair of shoes or what have you. So if you shop here, cool. Rue21's just not for me.
