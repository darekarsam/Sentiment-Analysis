4	Good pizza  & good service, I do the delivery thing here and so far, so good.
1	Every time I order domino's there is some form of an issue. This time I ordered two pizzas, both with extra cheese, both were burnt & both had plenty of areas which had absolutely no cheese. I'm at the point where I would much rather spend the extra money for fuel, pizza peel... Anywhere else. While I appreciate the voicemail the manager left me while I was typing this offering me a credit for a free medium pizza, I doubt that it will be used.
