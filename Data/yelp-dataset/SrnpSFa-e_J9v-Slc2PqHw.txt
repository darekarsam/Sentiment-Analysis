5	This restaurant is an institution. It is the Pizza that set the bar for all other pizzas in my life. It makes the fries that shame all others that came later, and it was the social epicentre of my youth...Fellow TwoMountaineers have a Facebook group about this place. If your travels bring you through the North Shore on the way to or from Montreal, have an all dressed, and think of me who misses it so.
5	I had my first date here - a small all dressed. I live in the states, and whenever I'm home, its my first stop. It was the post-dance, gossip girls, central meet-ery, mom doesn't want to cook, will deliver fast, I LOVE THIS PLACE.It sets the all-dressed pizza standard. The poutine is scary-good and so worth all the calories.
5	Updating... recently I flew back to Montreal for a visit with my kids. We ordered a Poulet Dore pizza as soon as the plane wheels hit the tarmac, and it awaited hot and perfect at my Dad's place when we pulled in. The pizza is still perfect, and still better than anything I can get in Vancouver. We went to the PD to have lunch the next day.... and the poutine was good, but I had better during this same visit. Locals (like my old high school friends who eat there every Friday with their families) swear that since a change in ownership the pizza has deteriorated. I was still more than happy to eat it that first night, and every morning for breakfast.
