4	We're essentially neighbors of the Quick Stop and I feel like we're there nearly every day. It's your typical convenience store, but it's very clean, well-stocked, and well-organized. As a bonus, I love that they have Donut Connection donuts!If you're in a pinch and just need a quick snack or item, it's nice to have a good option that lacks the insanity of a GetGo, while providing nearly everything that you could need.
