3	Bellacino's overall has pretty good pizza & above average subs, & you sure do get a large "grinder". Their grinders come loaded with toppings & are absolutely huge. And don't get Subway sizes mixed up in your head with Bellacino's, because if you order a full size grinder you'll be in for a shock. It's right around 20", with the half grinder around 10". Also, all of their grinders are over toasted so expect a crispy crust unless you specify otherwise. They have some pretty diverse grinder options to choose from, but you won't be too thrilled if you love to customize (they only have a few options there). Outside of the grinder realm, their pizzas are pretty good & greasy. Nothing too great though, but not too bad for the price & size. This is their other specialty based on their namesake, but I'd definitely choose grinder over pizza here. They do have other menu items, but I've never ventured into that realm.
3	If you want a sub (called a "grinder" here), but don't want the usual (or an image of Jared while you eat), go to Bellacino's and you won't be sorry.  As mentioned by Nick, these things are monstrous.  Not just in length, but in width too.The bread is probably twice as wide as a Subway sub, and it's at least 505 longer than a standard Subway sub.  Add to that a good variety to choose from, and all of them oven-baked (unless you ask for otherwise), and you've got a good meal, even at the small size.  The large are gigantic.  I can barely finish a small myself.I've only tasted their pizza from someone else's plate, but it looks pretty good.
