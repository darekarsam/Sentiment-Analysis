2	Crust was soggy even though the pie was lacking in sauce. It was too thick, and the rest of the ingredients were lost, though were of good quality. The taste of the crust was good however. so if you like your pizza crust on the soft and doughy side, its an ok pizza.
2	English is a beautiful language. Cheap can mean either 1) low cost, and 2) low in quality. In this case, we have both forms. Dollar cheese slices, $5 gyro, $3.50 (not so) small poutine. Good deal? Well not if the food is gross. Meat lovers pizza had fake bacon on it, and although hot, just had no taste. As for the poutine, fries were "mccaine", gravy was chemical orange, and the cheese was a mix of half-frozen curds and shredded mozzarella. Barely passable. On a budget, or late night after a night of drinking, it'll do. Just expect cheap both ways.
3	The poutine was wonderfully  messy and definitely satisfied my evening cravings. I didn't care too much for the mozzarella that was on top, but I did like gravy.
