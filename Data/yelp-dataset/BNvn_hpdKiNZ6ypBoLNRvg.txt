5	Need something printed? This is "the" place to go in the burgh.I had some t-shirts printed for a non profit. And the entire process was smooth - the price was very reasonable.  And they have a wide selection of different fabrics from AA and others.The turn around time is only 7 days or less - And I believe they match any competitive prices.Looking forward to printing some more t-shirts in the future
5	Great Printing, great Price.  Fast Email communication.Stop by their place in oakland, good group all around.Repeat customer here
5	When looking for Free Trade brands like American Apparel look no further than Underground Printing. They make sure to get to know your cause as well as your timeline & budget. Great email and phone communication!
