2	I've been going to the Jean Talon location for close to a decade and have always loved their food. I was pretty excited to hear that an express version was opening near where I live. Sadly, I've experienced nothing but unapologetically slow service at the St. Laurent location ever since.This evening my wife and I waited 45 just to place our order after multiple unanswered calls and a handful of times left on hold for minutes on end. When we finally got through and placed the order we were assured that it would arrive in 45 minutes. It was nearly an hour and half before the doorbell rang.It pains me to write such a negative review of a place whose food I love, but the service at the St Laurent location is just pathetic. It should never take over 2 hours to receive a small order from any restaurant with "express" in their name.
1	Horrible service. This rating is solely based on the service you receive. Upon picking up a takeout order, I was told there's delivery service in my exact area. No extra fees included. Which made me happy since it's out of my way from work to home. So I place a delivery order by phone and the guy tells me there's a 'delivery fee' of $5.50!!!Not only is that fee preposterous, the guy literally laughed in my ear when asking about the fee.Needless to say I'll mention it to everyone I know.
1	Are you freaking kidding me? Not only is it CASH ONLY for delivery in the year 2014, but there is a 25$ minimum required; it also didn't help that their attitude was so off the charts rude either. Just suck it up and go to the Jean Talon location cause this place certainly ain't worth it. It's like, -20 C out there tonight and all I wanted was some GD palak paneer, way to kill a dream Bombay Mahal Express, way to kill a dream.
