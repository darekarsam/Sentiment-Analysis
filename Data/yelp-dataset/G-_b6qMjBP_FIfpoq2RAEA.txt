5	Great men's barbershop.  Well worth the drive.
5	Read the the review from DG and they are right.  Great place.  This will be the main barbershop I will go to from now on.
5	Great place.  This is the second time I have gone to him and will continue.  Good price, good attitude, and he knows how to cut; a perfectionist.
5	Stopped in today for my first haircut after moving back to Arizona from California.  Oz was the barber in the shop and he has been there cutting hair for over 10 years.  Nice guy and he did an excellent job.  I would definitely go back.  His shop is a real neighborhood shop and not one of the fancy franchise places.  Felt comfortable, professional and he made me feel at home.
