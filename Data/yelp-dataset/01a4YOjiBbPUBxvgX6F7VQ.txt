5	I saw Maggie to regulate my irregular menstrual cycle.  Immediately following my first session,  my cycle began for the first time in months!  I was pleasantly surprised with the great results!  Would recommend for any woman struggling with female problems, or anyone at all for that matter.  Thanks so much Maggie :)
5	Been there twice so far and have to say Maggie is so sweet and very knowledgeable. She listens to your concerns and gives you advice outside of acupuncture to help with your problem. The office is very clean and easily accessible to anyone who lives in the south hills.
5	I never had acupuncture before. They do have Saturday hours - which was important to me because of my work schedule.   I saw Maggie and she was very nice and professional. The first session you fill out new patient forms, meet with doctor to discuss your issues or history.  And then have the first treatment.The office building is older, but their office is nice.  Everything was clean and professional.  It actually seemed cleaner and more calming than most doctors offices.I will definitely go back.
