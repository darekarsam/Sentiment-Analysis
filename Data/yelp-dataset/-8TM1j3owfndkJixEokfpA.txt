5	What's a guy doing recommending a woman's fashion boutique?In one word "sexy".Carine's carries a great selection of sexy, fashionable woman's wear at the Scottsdale Quarter.
1	fantastic, unique clothes are overshadowed by the snotty attitudes of the staff (not Carine or Randall).  Shopped there for the last time yesterday.  Not worth it.  Will spend my time and money at Elan or Mina's.
5	I have shopped for my wife at both locations and found the staff to be very helpful and pleasant. Carine has a great eye for fashion and keeps her merchandise up with the latest trends and classic styles.
