4	This is a wonderful place. When you enter, you're hit with the aroma of blooming flowers. They sell a variety of exotic orchids that brighten up the room.I'm especially fond of coming here in the Spring time. They take entire branches from trees and allow them to bloom right in the store. The colors and smells are amazing.Along with flowers, they also sell bath items such as French milled soaps, body lotions and perfumes. The quality is top of the line but so are the prices.My girlfriend and I love coming in here just to see the flowers, their wares and their two big dogs sleeping on the floor.
3	Stop in here for all of your overpriced candles, orchids, and meditation books and scented everythings. Although I probably would never purchase anything here, it's a nice little shop owned by a couple of nice guys in the heart of Shadyside that's good to stop in when you're in the neighborhood. The ambience here is the highlight, with an aroma of goodness and soft soothing music playing in the background. Sometimes the owners have their dog resting at the foot of the counter, which is another highlight for me!
5	Yesterday I received, without question, the most exquisite bouquet from Toadflax. My family had been through a lot this past month, but this arrangement was so colorful, so diverse, so beautifully orchestrated, that it absolutely brightened my day and lifted my spirits for the evening.I'm hesitant to add a photo, as I honestly cannot get a shot that does these flowers justice.Thank you, Toadflax! You've got my business for sure.
