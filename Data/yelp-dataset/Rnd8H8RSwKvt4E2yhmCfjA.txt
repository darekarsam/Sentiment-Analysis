4	I have never met a pediatrician that was as lively as Dr. Naiman and that includes my own growing up. Many have been patient, friendly and thorough but Dr. Naiman takes it a step up by being entertaining. Granted the waits can be a bit much, its worth it. He has a lot of knowledge and will give you suggestions and tell you which he would choose and why. The nurses are also very courteous and welcoming. I recommend him to anyone looking for a great doctor for their children.
5	By far seeing Dr Naiman has been the best experience ever for myself and my son...originally we had interviewed a different doctor in the practice but once we delivered Dr Naiman was the doctor from the group doing rounds for those few days...my husband and I made a decision to continue to see him because he was so knowledgeable. ..had a great bedside manner and made us feel extremely comfortable and took the time to answer or questions and educate us... you cannot go wrong with Dr Naiman as your pediatrician for your child....
5	Such a pleasant visit. We switched pediatricians and I think tho was the right choice.It seemed chaotic at first when you walk in but the ladies at the front desk work fast. The wait was short. They brought us back and and weighed the two older kids while I undressed the baby. After weight and height we waited about 5 minutes before the doctor came in. He spoke to each kid one by one and treated them so well. The kids enjoyed him. He was easy to talk to and explained things thoroughly. He seemed to have an unlimited amount of patience. I'm glad we chose him!
