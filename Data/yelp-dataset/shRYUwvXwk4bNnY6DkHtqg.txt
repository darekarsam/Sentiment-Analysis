1	Met with the big guy who calls himself Greg went over our bankruptcy info told us he will refund us the money If we were to change our mind but it had to be before petition! Well I ended up divorcing my husband and had to move to another state, kept on making payments then they told me they could not file while I was in a different state! Requested my money back and this fat jerk told me that he used all my 500 I paid on legal questions and answers WTF . He is a bastard that's all I can say! Don't trust him unless u all have it on the paper! Pisses me off because he didn't even file anything nor had my info and told me that bull shit! Hope karma gets him and all their lying office assistants!
4	Last year I was at a complete loss for whom to call for help with my divorce. I started out using a paralegal, but there were just too many legal details for me to deal with and questions to be answered. Luckily, I was referred to Malkin & Associates. My attorney was Kevin Vale. Kevin was knowledgeable, patient and smart about the case. He answered all of my questions and gave me all of the options before moving forward. Even when he disagreed, he listened to my reasoning and moved forward with my choices. The cost is an absolute bargain...which I found out after talking to friends who paid 4x as much and are still not done with their divorce proceedings. Thanks to Kevin, I am done and not broke!  :)
1	This guy handled...well he did this very poorly.  He attempted to handle a legal matter for my wife.  His office closed down and did not finish the paper work.  No one picked up the pieces to make sure the paperwork was done correctly.  Yes he became ill but he had other lawyers in his office that could have helped.  We ended up paying even more through our noses because of the inefficiency of his office.
