2	We did not have a good experience with Summer pools.  A few complaints:- dirty spots left week after week - missed weeks of service because of weather but charges were still the same - broken parts to the pool that were not replaced after 3-4 weeks of requests.- switched to a different weekly service and now we are being charged less, all spots in the pool are clean.  Kirk has a nice guy working for him, but it's hard to recommend the service.
