2	Quiet Restaurant, I am not sure how to describe my experience, but Yelp says it all "Meh. I've experienced better." It's not a WOW restaurant, Its not where I would take a date, nor family. Food is average. Could not say much more of the staff.
3	We were invited by our nice neighbors to eat at this local breakfast joint and needless to state, my visit was nothing special to write home about.The decor is old fashioned, with a much older crowd (50s-70s) during a Saturday morning visit around 10 AM. No line-ups. No fuss for a big comfortable booth.The service was adequate but sadly we needed to request staff to refill our coffee at least once. Asking for coffee refills quirks me more than it should but I could tell staff was far too busy to adequately provide us our the right amount of service. Our meals were provided somewhat slow but slow enough to annoy us.I ordered a standard breakfast of eggs, ham, bacon and potatoes and the restaurant delivered with a decent breakfast. However with the competition in Laval for breakfast joints being what it is, I have to state, I've had better meals.The price tag is very reasonable so bonus points for that.Overall, I didn't dislike my experience nor did I really like it. Situated where it is, barely 2 minutes from my house I cannot complain.
4	Very nice atmosphere, fast service , and fair prices, good for family and couples the only thing is the small parking in a front
4	Came here for dinner with the family. Staff was extremely accommodating. Ordered the souvlaki pita with fries and salad as a table hote. Soup was excellent. Pita was very good but a bit on the spare side, salad and fries were very good. Rice was decent as well. Got coffee and rice pudding with syrup. Everything was very solid.Would come again.
