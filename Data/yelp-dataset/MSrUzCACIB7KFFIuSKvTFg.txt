5	Natural Reflections has such great customer service. We recently purchased our first home and although we weren't looking for one, we were lucky it had a pool! First month went by and everything was fine and we thought taking care of a pool was no big deal...well than summer hit and it got hot hot hot out and our pool turned green.. Very green to say the least to where we couldn't see to the bottom. I know..gross. So we called to see if they cld send someone out to help us and give us a little how to in taking care of our pool cause we had already brought samples of our water into the local pool store and was getting no where with them... All they wanted us to do was buy this and that and wasn't even working. So Dane from natural reflections came out not once but twice to help us and took his time explaining how our pool worked and what we needed to do to maintain it. Finally our pool is sparkling clean and we are so happy to have it. Dane and the staff are excellent and would highly recommend having them help you before going to that pool store down the road.
5	Natural Reflections recently completed a minor reno on my pool. They put the backyard back together perfectly. The new pool equipment and laminars are amazing. Loving the switch to salt water. Thanks to the guys at Natural Reflections I'm using the pool regularly again.
