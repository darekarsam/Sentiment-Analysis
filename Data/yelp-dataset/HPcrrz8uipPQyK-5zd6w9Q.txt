3	This is a Pizza Hut/Wing Street. i hate to review chains unless something really stands out, but i figure there should be at least one review saying it's not a shit hole. Pizza Hut is an old family favorite, surprisingly for their spaghetti, so with my mom in town we tried the local Belmont location. Some locations have different bread sticks then i am used to, but this one had the delicious, garlic covered ones. Spaghetti with meat sauce was good as expected with excellent garlic bread. It seems like a smaller dining room, i'm not sure what was around the one wall, may have been more seating. Service was friendly enough, no complaints.
2	I get take-out from here occasionally, purely out of convenience and lack of competition.  During my last pick-up, the evening of 6-22-12, I witnessed a patron quietly complaining about the confusion and lack of separation between those waiting to pay, waiting for an order, and waiting to be seated.  The front waiting area was in mass confusion.  The response from the manager on duty was to insult the patron, saying "grown men should be able to wait on pizza, and basically, I don't care".  This is not an acceptable response for management.  The quality of our pizza is mediocre at best, with the toppings being more than 2 inches from the edge on a hand tossed pizza.  The lady at the register was friendly as usual.This Pizza Hut is not a top choice, but ok in a pinch.
2	SmellsGood service, good food but the place smells like an old, musty motel room. I'm local and have been there several times and it always smells. There's almost a "needs cleaning" public bathroom tinge to it as well. You'll know; stop where the little foyer ends about 15' inside the front door and inhale through your nose.It's an old place so it's time for renovation or replacement.
