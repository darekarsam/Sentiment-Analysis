3	This is tucked it the back of the Flamingo by their gardens. We had some time to kill before the ride to the airport so we had a couple of sandwiches. They were very good. Ham and cheese on a french roll. But two of them and a bottle of water turned into 24 bucks. We could have had lunch at a restaurant for that kind of coin.
2	Well my first and only experience at the Java Detour wasn't the best experience.  A plus for Java Detour or at least for me was there was no line or for that matter no customers at all. I love my White Chocolate Mocha's so I ordered a medium.  It took a couple of minutes to make, I paid my $4.31 and as I was walking away I realized they gave me a small.  I told the employee that I ordered a medium and he said I ordered a small but then he knew he made a mistake and said that I only paid for a small.  He then said he would make me a medium but after tasting the drink I definitely did not want a medium.
2	OH! WHAT A PITY! WHEN COFFEE TASTES SH*TTYWhat I really want at some coffee places is a 12 oz. whipped cream with some coffee on top. When the beverage isn't great, why not get something you do enjoy?! Like a cup of whipped cream. That's what I should have done because the drink we ordered at Java Detour was either made incorrectly or was just all around awful. We didn't even finish it and I hate being wasteful.Nino was behind the register and very friendly, even when we pointed out the incorrect drink size. We declined an offer for a new drink and went on our merry way, wishing there'd been more whipped cream.
