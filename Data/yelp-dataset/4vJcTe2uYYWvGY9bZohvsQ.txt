5	We live in Fountain Hills, and our water softener was leaking.   We called Chris at Aqua Pro, and we were very happy with the repair he performed, as well as providing us with the name of someone he would recommend for irrigation system service.  Chris also does plumbing and reverse osmosis systems.We highly recommend Chris and Aqua Pro, especially if you live in Fountain Hills...he has been a resident for over 30 years.
5	Aquapro is our preferred plumbing provider for the past 10 years. Referred to us by a neighbor, Chris is always professional and educates you on what you need and why you need it. He has worked on our Reverse Osmosis system, Fixtures, Refrigerator Water Dispenser and most recently replaced our Water Softener system. They are neither the most expensive or inexpensive provider, but the service we receive is always the highest quality. You get more than you pay for with Aquapro. I am confident that the service I receive is top notch, and Chris will stand by the work he does, and he will be around to back it up. His wife Vicky does the scheduling and billing, and keeps things running smoothly and efficiently. Chris shows up when she schedules him without a large window of time to be waiting for his arrival, and billing is always easy to deal with. I don't often recommend service providers, because one person's experience doesn't always reflect what another will perceive, but I know with Aquapro, you will get what you pay for from someone who takes pride in their work and their business. Thank you Chris and Vicky.
