5	Best experience I've ever had and I've owned about ten houses in the past. Great customer service
5	I worked with Paul Parshley at the Tempe location. He was very professional, he always kept in touch, and is very knowledgeable in his line of work. With the help of Paul, everything went quickly and smoothly.
5	Jessica Blackwell at Prospect Mortgage was amazing. We contacted her last minute because FHA was on a financing hold in the condo I was trying to purchase. My student loans prevented me from qualifying for a conventional loan that I could afford but Jessica worked diligently to figure out something that would work. I am truly grateful. I was told no by many lenders prior to meeting Jessica and she kept a positive attitude and was always working some kind of magic. I could not thank her enough.
