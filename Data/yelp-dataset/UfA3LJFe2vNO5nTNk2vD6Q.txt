4	L'endroit est sympa et lumineux. Les portions sont bonnes ; quand on sort de la , on n'a plus faim. Les gaufres sont bonnes. Et les prix raisonnables.
3	This place has kinda become the back up to my staple breakfast place. When I get bored, I come here and for the most part all goes over well. Pro - Breakfast (eggs and bacon) are always pretty consistent and done to meet expectations.  - Service is friendly (even in English) - Banana Bread is AMAZING- Pretty decent prices. Con - Sometimes the wait can be a little much. Be it waiting on a table (watching bus people walk around looking lost) or the kitchen having a bad day.- The floors need a really good scrubAll and all - It's not out of this world but it's not the worst either. Besides, its just eggs!
