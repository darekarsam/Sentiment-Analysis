4	Originally the smoothie rush sign outside caught my attention, so after my workout, I headed next door. Not sure if all of the other locations are located next to gyms but whomever decided to put this right next to Gold's....THANK YOU!!!  I could tell as soon as I walked in that they had a great selection of supplements, vitamins, protein, fat burners and everything in between.  I did a quick walk through and the prices seemed comparable to other nutrition and supplement stores in the area.  Though the store isn't massive, the shelves are packed out with a variety of products.  So after quickly looking around, I headed to the counter for my main reason coming into Nutrition Rush, the smoothie rush.  Unfortunately there was only one guy working but greeted everyone as they walked in.  There was a line waiting for smoothies.  After waiting a few minutes, I made my selection and was impressed!  They have different options for flavors and add-ins.  I would suggest the Oreo Blast or Monkey Rush.  By the time the guy at the counter helped several people including myself, another employee came in.  The smoothie was definitely worth the wait and I will return.
5	My favorite location of Nutrition Rush. Once you walk in, automatic help. If they don't have it they automatically tell you they can order it. Where as other locations when they don't have the product than you are S O L. They don't offer an alternative other than, "sorry we don't have it." Very convenient, located close to the Flamingo LVAC. I don't usually go to this location but it's by far my favorite because of the customer service. They even call you when they have the product that you need which is pretty helpful. And they are pretty quick with the orders.
