1	This restaurant is horrible!  In particular, the service was totally lacking.  The restaurant was staffed by comatose teenagers who apparently have not been properly trained OR they just don't care.  One sandwich was wrapped in a dirty juice-splashed wrapper.  The food was tasteless and the service abysmal.....I won't be going there again!
1	Worst service and sandwich I've ever had at a Subway.  Jared wouldn't come here!
5	Nothing wrong with this Subway.  Fresh and fast!  I've been here 20 times since they've opened.  My favorite Subway.
1	2 strips of bacon on a six inch sub for a breakfast sandwich??  Also you need help that talks!  The guy that helped me this am had the personality of a slug!
4	I have eaten at this subway numerous times and enjoyed it. It is nice on convenient because it is across from the traffic chaos in desert ridge.  My favorite would be the new apple wood pork sandwich!  Really Gwooood!
1	It seems like every time I go there the customer service gets worse. Almost every time I go I end up buying multiple meals yet that doesn't seem to be enough to deserve some good customer service. A smile, a hey how are ya? Nothing. It's the opposite, they are rude and have nothing but snide remarks to give you. The saddest part is that the worse customer service comes from their manager. How do u expect your employees to have good customer service when their lead example is the worst one of them all.  I'm Glad subways are everywhere and I don't have to bring my business here.
