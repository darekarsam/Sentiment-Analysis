5	The IRS hit me with a $17k tax bill out of nowhere from a previous tax year.  I had already had two big tax companies go over my taxes for that year and was amazed that I still owed that much.  Knowing there had to be a mistake somewhere I tried Kevin Johnson, and he not only figured it out (stock reporting error) but I ended up only owing less than a dollar because of what I had already paid previously.  Am doing my taxes with him again this year.
5	We moved to the valley last year, and were looking for a tax professional.  As many of us do, we reached out to friends and co-workers for referrals. Kevin D. Johnson came highly recommended from a friend and we couldn't be happier with his services.  He went above and beyond answering all our questions and preparing us for the upcoming year.  We will definitely be using him again!!
5	Would definitely recommend their services.  Highly professional and honest. Complete confidence with our business!
