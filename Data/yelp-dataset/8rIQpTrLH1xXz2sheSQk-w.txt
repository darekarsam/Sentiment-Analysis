4	My first experience of Holi Spice was an odd one - I had made an order for take-away and when I went to collect it their card machine wasn't working..so they gave it to me for free! With free popadoms. I felt quite bad though, and after eating the meal (which was delicious) I went back with cash.The food is delicious. Really yummy and full of flavour, everything is made fresh to order. My favourite is the chicken korma, which is as good as any i've ever had.As the Indian is also a restaurant, however, I always feel really uncomfortable walking in. I've only ever seen one table eating when I've been in, all the other times it has been empty. As a result, the staff are extremely attentive and were pouring over themselves to serve me, giving me freebies left, right and centre. I always choose to collect the food myself as I only live 5 minutes away and I like to think I'm burning the calories I;m about to consume (!), but they also have free delivery.I really hope Holi Spice survives, it's a really good Indian and the staff are lovely.
3	Not bad, I must say, though the masala curry was oddly sweet. My brother and I ate here our first night in town, and quite enjoyed it. The lamb naan was very, very good. The chicken pakoras were oddly slimy inside, though, like some of the batter hadn't been cooked thoroughly. Chicken was cooked, though, so all's good. Delicious chutneys and sauces for the papadum, so that was great.
