5	Wesley and the girls at Paws Attraction are amazing--super friendly, great customer service, good prices.  They show so much love to my pets every time.  I would truly recommend this to others!
5	Haven't been to very many grooming salons, but if they were gentle and professional enough to not get attacked by my dog than that are ok in my book.  Quick, efficient, friendly, and affordable.  When I picked my dog Samson up, I noticed the amount of hair that was groomed off of him.  The first thought came to mind was that they must have spent 4 hours de shedding this guy! Nope, only about 45 minutes.  Grade A work right there.Samson's paw of approval....checkRyan's nod of approval.....CheckWell done... Paws attraction...well done...
5	I found this gem a few years ago for my 6 pups and am so happy I did.  I have three little show dogs which they groom, special condition, and cut the exact way each dog should be for the breed.  They go above and beyond the normal groomers cut and style and they smell Devine when they are finished .  As for the other three big boy dogs I have, the groomer girlz love on them and treat them just as if they were royalty or as their own!! All 6 of my dogs know the routine every two weeks, the can't wait to get groomed. All 6 of them load as fast as they can I to my truck, patiently panting until they see the shop and boom bust out my truck and run straight to the paws attraction doors waiting to lick the sweet ladies!  I love this place, if you are like me and your doggies are as precious as your children then trust me this is the only place you will want them groomed.  They hand dry and style them and they even let some babies play around and enjoy socializing. Love love love this place.
