5	This branch is perfect for me. It's close to my place and the staff is always very professional and courteous every time I go in. Never had a problem with this branch yet. Plus it's close to I-15 so you can get around to other parts of the city fairly quickly. I recommend this branch.
5	Always have good luck with usbank always nice and professional! Great location and employees are very helpful. I've had account for many years never a problem.
5	Nice friendly and fast. Is not your usual bank behind big thick glass. You actually sit at a desk with the banker. Kind of a nice change.
