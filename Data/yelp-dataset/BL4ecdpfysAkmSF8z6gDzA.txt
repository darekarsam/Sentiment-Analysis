3	Am I a bad person? A gross person? I really do love Subway.. time for honesty, I eat here at least 3 times a week.  It's only a block from my work and maybe that contributes to my Subway habit, or maybe it's the fact that the lunch crew knows my name. I hope this confession does not make me yucky.
5	Walked into this subway with a list of seven subs all custom orders; right during a lunch time rush... People behind the counter knocked it out pretty quick, and with a good attitude. Can't really ask for more than that.
2	Haven't been to Subway in a while, but boy have they gotten skimpy on the fillings. I realize they are cheaper than other sand which places, but I would rather pay a little for a sandwich that actually has substance.
