2	This place has the potential to be very good, but it's very inconsistent when it comes to their product.  In the past I've found the taste a bit bland, and today the pizza was overcooked.
4	I moved to the area about 6 years ago, found this place quite by surprise while on an early evening stroll. Very much in an unassuming place, it would seem only the locals would known it exists if not for the menus that arrived in my mailbox that I finally found it. Since I had been a fan of Mamma`s and Coronet for the past 5 years I decided to try this place to compare. I ordered the pizza, special no1 (minus the olives) and was FABULOUS!! A hefty pizza for a `small` the bacon was perfectly fragrant & crispy, the dough was cooked through and the cheese was nice and stringy. Although I have only tried the pizza I feel this place deserves more merit and support as it is on my shortlist for return visits.
