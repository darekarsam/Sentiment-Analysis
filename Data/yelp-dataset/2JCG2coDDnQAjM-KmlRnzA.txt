5	Called Croffoot after waking up to No A/C.  They promptly returned our call and scheduled to come out same day (heading into record heat weekend).  Prior to showing up I received a call the  technician was running ahead of schedule and could be there an hour early if I was available  (when was the last you heard that?). Kirk arrived and promptly diagnosed and fixed the issue.  The A/C was up and running shortly after arrival.  Very professional, prompt, and reasonably priced.  What else are you looking for? Will use Croffoot for all future needs.
5	This is your guy.  A locally owned business where customer service and honesty are at the top.  We have been using Croffoot for over 4 years and even had them install a new unit at my Mother's house.  They are very fair in their pricing and will work with you.  Support the good guy call Croffot!
5	Kirk and Susie are superb!  Susie does a great job troubleshooting over the phone.  Kirk is prompt, courteous, professional and always thorough!  I will never use anyone else for my A/C needs
