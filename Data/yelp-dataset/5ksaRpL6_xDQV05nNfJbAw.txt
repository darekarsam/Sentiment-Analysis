5	Love this place.  Their house juices are awesome (try the Kloud Kake for a really great custardy cheesecake flavor) and they're cheap too!  Great mechanical mods and the vape techs are all friendly and very knowledgeable.
5	Love the atmosphere of this place. It's relaxing and comfortable. Food and customer service is great! Its the perfect place for vapors to hang out. They also host little fun music events!
2	Not open 24/7. This may sound crazy, but it was 2am in Vegas and my buddy forgot to bring ejuice. I didn't really expect it to be open, but their sign out front even says 24/7. They were closed. Oh well...
