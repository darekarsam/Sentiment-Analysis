4	I come here all the time since it's in the same shopping center as the market! The sushi is always fresh and tasty at a very reasonable price. They offer a pretty good selections of rolls and sushis but the hot/cooked options seems limited. I always get the pre made sushi boxes since it has a great combo of rolls, fresh and fast! The ladies that work there are always super nice and accommodating to my picky kids and their special orders!Overall it's a great place to get take out or grab a quick lunch not really a place to have a nice date night dinner. Since it's in the middle of the shopping center and there are people walking by.
