4	Really nice selection of affordable quality wines both international and stateside, huge beer selection, and Palermo's Pizza if you need some dinner. Seriously, you gotta like that.  A clean and pleasant place that is locally owned.Located in something of a small strip mall, right next to Summit CU at the corner of Sprecher and Cottage Grove Road. It's much more spacious inside that you might expect.
4	This place is great for beer lovers.  If you are looking for a six-pack this is your place.  I wish they sold mini kegs.  I like that they are conveniently located on the corner nowhere near any other store.  It makes it nice for those of us that live on the edge of town.  I love that they have a private lot.  It is easy to get in and get out.  The place is clean and I never feel weird or scared walking in there at any hour.
5	This is the only Liquor store in the area. the owner is personable, friendly and helpful and knowledgeable.   The selection of fine wines, small crafted beers, and if you can not find what you want, just ask, he will order it for you. Only thing I can suggest is delivery service.   The store is clean , neat and very organized, The owner has done his homework.   Check it out, you will find hard to find fine wines to ready to pour cocktails and even whipped cream in a can with 80% alcohol.   Also you can put together your own 6 packs of beer, and single serving wines.   This is the best Liquor store I have ever been to, almost like a cheers kind of feel, very  friendly
