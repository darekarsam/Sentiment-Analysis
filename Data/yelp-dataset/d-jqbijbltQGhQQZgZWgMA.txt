5	So after being snowed in for 2.5 days I had to break out of the house. After running errands I spotted this lil gem. The renovation is beautiful. They atmosphere was so relaxing as I chose my color for my pedicure. I was greeted promptly with smiles. They brought me to my pedicure throne and offered me a beverage. The smooth jazz played as I sipped my wine and I melted into the comfy chair. This was the perfect ending to a hectic week. Very clean and I was very impressed with the high standards of customer service. I will definitely be back!
5	Hands down...best salon in town!!!! Very nice, extra clean and on top of that, the technicians were top notch. My toes and fingers look better than any salon I have been to. I hope not to offend anyone when I say it was also refreshing that everyone spoke perfect English. I went on a Sunday and they had three other ladies in there but my little girl and I left like we were the only ones in there. Once you discover this place you will not go anywhere else.
5	After a rough couple of days I decided to stop in for a pedicure. A couple of ladies from my church highly recommend this place so I wanted to see for myself. I went in and told them what I wanted and they told me there would be a 20 minute wait. I needed the time to unwind so I agreed to it. They ended up starting to run water for me before I even finished picking my color. Everyone was very nice and I had a great experience. I will be back.
5	I went to Lavender Nails for the second time and they did a great job!  I waited for about ten minutes and they apologized for the wait!  Anywhere else I would have been waiting for an hour.   Amazing job! I will definitely be back.
