5	I have been in sured by Lynn Hennessy for 12 years.  I just spent the afternoon with her and her FABULOUS assistant Judy reviewing all of my insurance and making sure I had enough coverage for me and my daughter.  The passion these ladies have on educating you on insurance is amazing.  Lynn also sits down with each teenage driver before they become insured and goes through an AMAZING presentation showing them how their insurance goes up if they get a ticket, or a DUI.  You can tell she is an agent who goes above and beyond.  I really enjoy working with Lynn and her team, they work very hard and out of integrity.  That is hard to find in the insurance world now adays.  Go TEAM HENNESSY!
5	Lynn Hennessy's experience with home, auto, and life insurance is second to none. Her friendly team is always ready to assist, handles every case with precision and great care, and gives the personalized service that is lacking in many other insurance agencies. This office provides a service that is truly a cut above the rest! Lynn Hennessy with State Farm is the best possible choice for your insurance needs, and I will continue to refer this business to all of my family and friends.
5	Lynn is my Life/Health/Disability insurance agent.  She took the time to make sure I choose the right product to protect my family and be in my budget.  I sleep better now knowing that my wife and son will be OK if the something was to happen to me. Thank you Lynn.
