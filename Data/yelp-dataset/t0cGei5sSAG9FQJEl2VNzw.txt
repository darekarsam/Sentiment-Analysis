5	Came in. for a brake job...upon inspection, the told me the squeek was a buildup of brake dust...they cleaned it up and sent me on my way...NO CHARGE!!!.professional staff, clean waiting area...highly recommend!!
1	They severely lack in service. They love to sell you their two year alignment package, but they don't really want to do the alignments. They will not take appointments  so here I am at 11:30 am and must sit here until 5:30 pm to get my car aligned. All about the service, aren't they? Btw all locations are the  same.
5	I was hearing a grinding sound wherever I went and when I called to see if they could get me in, and was told to come right down. I did and they got me in fast, told me i needed new rear brakes and made the repairs very quickly. And low and behold, the grinding was fixed!The store took GREAT care of me and I'll definitely use them again!
