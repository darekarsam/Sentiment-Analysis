4	While I've been a reader of Yelp for a while, this is the first review I've ever been compelled to make. I had to renew my license and the "East" branch of the Charlotte DMV made it a breeze. DMV offices ALWAYS get a bad rap, but at this office, the employees truly try to make the process more efficient and were all very pleasant tempered and personable. True, they are understaffed, but that blame lies largely on the state and budget issues, not the department or this location. I used to go to the "hidden" old location on Idewild and had similar experiences. So maybe when they moved locations, the staff traveled with.I went in on a Friday morning right when they opened at 8 and there was only about five people in line. That being said, I still recommend making an appointment as soon as you receive a notice in the mail. I made my appointment a full month before my license was set to expire and the earliest appointment I could get was not even a week before my license expired. Do not wait! When I left about 15 minutes after i got there (make an appointment, seriously, you will be in and out in a fraction of the time.) there were about 10 people waiting for their numbers to be called and three people in line to pull tickets.I would have given 5 stars, but they DON'T TAKE PLASTIC! be prepared to have cash or check. They will let you come right back and pay (and skip the whole line when you come back) if you don't have cash or check and they are very understanding.
