4	I stumbled upon this low profile kosher bakery one night biking up to Park Ex. A friend had recommended it at one point for bread so I thought I'd check out their selection and try a few things. The baked goods are truly homemade, hearty and delicious. Their fresh rye bread is my favorite in the city and I've heard through a very reliable resource that the chala there is divine! If you're looking for a fancy atmosphere or any bells and whistles this is not the place for you but if you're in the market for baked goods (specifically good bread and sweets) you'll be happy to get kosher at homemade!P.S. Apparently all of their goods are produced in a nut-free environment so you can buy worry-free if you have nut allergies!
4	they make some of the best bagels in Montreal fresh from wood oven all day long. make sure to ask for them hot. oddly, they also make great spring rolls. be sure to ask  at the counter if there is a fresher+hotter version of what you are buying in the back as they have a huge bakery on site...
