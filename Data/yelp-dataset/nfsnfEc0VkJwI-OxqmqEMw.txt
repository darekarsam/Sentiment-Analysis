4	Oh Canada. You so crazy. Ice fishing right downtown, steps from the beautiful architecture and sweeping lights of Old Montreal is quintessentially Canadian and worth doing, even if you don't catch anything. We sat in a heated hut around the holes in the floor, jigging our lines and laughing hard at how freezing we were and how strange our life choices. My advice, wait for a warmer day, and plan on an hour or two, and maybe find out if the restaurant on the ice have got their liquor licence before you go.
3	Came here on possibly the coldest day, like ever; heated cabin my ass, I nearly froze to death. We caught nothing, it was super expensive and the place has no liquor licence...seriously? Perhaps it would have been more fun if it wasn't -30, if I could have been sipping on Bailey's with my cocoa and if we had actually caught something, but I dunno. The place looks cool, I laughed non-stop for 2 hours, I love the concept of fishing down town, the guy who set up our lines was rad and I came out with some serious bragging rights and cool pictures. Dress warm, wear extra socks and come with a good sense of humour.
