5	These guys were SO helpful! Most movers overcharge you just to move a piece of furniture- they were a great price and incredibly helpful! They even did little extras for me! I would recommend these boys to anyone who needs just a few heavy pieces moved or an entire house!! Call them today!!
5	They were very helpful, affordable, and nice. They really get the job done. I would recommend them to anyone in the area.
4	Another local mover (initials A.V.L.) failed to show 2 hours after their scheduled time. In a pinch I called 1 Man 2 Hands. Their quote was lower than A.V.L.'s AND they showed  within 2 hours of my phone call. Lovell and an associate cleared my 1 bedroom apartment and loaded an ABF ReloCube in under an hour. Definitely recommended.
