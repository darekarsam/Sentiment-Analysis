5	if you happen to be in west phoenix and need a burrito, go here. they have a lady in the back who makes the mackinest burritos all day, from the 5am huevos con hamon to the lunchtime MVP, steak ranchero. kinda pricey ($3.75 for the lunchtime burros) but in this area it's either that or sonic.
4	Sketch but the burritos are alright. And, in the food desert that is this area, you gotta take what you can get.
3	The breakfast burritos here are amazing. I highly recommend stopping in before work for the chorizo or steak breakfast burrito.  It's soooooo good. This place is on my way to work so I stop more often than I should. The burritos are huge and filling. Unfortunately the lunch burritos are not nearly as good and I'd pass them up. The burritos are $5.
