5	I stayed at this wonderful old world inn July 2013.  The service was wonderful and the large room was comfortable and well kept.  The best is that it's right in the heart of Old Montreal and within walking distance of the best restaurants and sights.  The owner also went out of her way after I left something in the right to work with me and make sure it was sent to me back in the US right away.  Thank you!
5	My husband and I stayed here on our mini-moon and it was just wonderful. Our room was beautiful, with arm chairs, exposed brick and big windows. We walked practically everywhere (to lots of good food, so probably good that we walked) and it wasn't that hard to find free parking (we paid for parking for first night though). It was full of small touches, like a sign hanging on the door of our room to welcome us, maps and guidebooks for our use and even a guitar on the second floor for guests to use (we didn't but it's a nice thought). Montreal is a beautiful city full of charm and Auberge De La Place Royale is the perfect place to stay.
5	My boyfriend and I stayed at Auberge de la Place Royal for two nights and we absolutely loved it. It is right in the heart of Old Montreal and so many lovely bars and restaurants are within walking distance, as is the metro. The hotel is beautiful and warm, and our room welcomed us with a little chalkboard on the door with my name written on it. It felt romantic and cozy with the rustic furniture and exposed brick and the room even had a corkscrew and little cafe table! The wifi worked perfectly (which was great as our American cell phones didn't have service). Note: complimentary coffee was remarkably delicious.
