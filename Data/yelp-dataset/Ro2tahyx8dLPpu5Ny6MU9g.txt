5	Highly recommend. Very honest & a very reasonable price!
5	Daniel just came to our house and was very kind and courteous. He was running at little late and was very apologetic.  I discussed the situation and he listened to me with interruption or making any assumptions. He trouble shot the unit and discussed pricing as we went along. I will definitely be recommending them again and be using them in the future.  He was super fast too! In the end he discussed the billing and didn't even use freon after cleaning the coils and rechecking the system.  As a contractor in another trade I appreciated every aspect of the service call.
1	2 days back, a guy from this company came to fix a stopped AC in my house. new house of 3.5 yrs old. The technician behavior was good, but he spent almost 1 hour and told me the circuit board in the furnace gone defective, and next day customer service told me the labour will be $420 to fit the new board. The board is under warranty from the manufacturer.Want to try with another co. Yesterday, I called another company to check. That technician fixed in less than 5 mnts, saying there is a switch which got tipped, so he put it back and the AC is running. I was in shock. But I happily paid their service call fee of $79.I paid $49 for the R&B service call, to get the wrong analysis.When reported this to this company, they refused to refund that amount. Now I planned to dispute the credit charge. Beware of knowledge of technicians. May be others are good, but the one came to my house, is not competent.
