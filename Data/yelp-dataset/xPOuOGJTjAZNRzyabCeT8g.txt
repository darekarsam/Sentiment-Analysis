5	I have been going to Athletic Club South End since it opened. Recently, they have changed their name to EVOLUTION. They are focused on martial arts, yoga, fitness training and functional training. They have great massage therapists on staff and awesome classes.   The staff is very friendly and foster a family atmosphere.  Trainers are top notch. I actually refer my clients to them for personal training, massage, VO2 testing, and yoga classes.  My four kids take Budokan - a mix of yoga, martial arts and meditation there as well.
4	This is a great little gym in a cool building.  They have lots of classes, lots of machines, and it is never crowded.  Plenty of staff to help you with whatever you need, and great trainers.  I'm happy to have found it.
4	Great gym with a new name. They've been open for approximately 7 years, but within the last year they changed their name. Everything looks in top condition.It's a clean and open space with a lot to offer. They have cardio equipment on the second floor, a few massage rooms, martial arts room, free weights, and spacious locker rooms. A vegetarian restaurant is going to be housed next door and open in July. I'm looking forward to check it out.The start up cost is $125 and for a couple it's approximately $105 per month. Very friendly staff. I wish it were closer to where I live and I would consider signing up.
