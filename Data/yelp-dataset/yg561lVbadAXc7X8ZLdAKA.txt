4	We found this family run establishment via 1st Friday art event downtown where they roll their smoker out.There was a line for the food, and it smelled yummy so we took note and headed uptown to visit their location.The "restaurant" is more like a drive through, with one shoddy picnic table. The menu is written on the window in paint and its very old school. WE LOVED IT! The food was home made and the ribs were smoked so well. The weird smoker thing is hauled around town, and we actually saw them again at Goldfield days in Goldfield NV not long after eating at their "restaurant". DO NOT MISS THE PEACH COBBLER! These are recipes haded down from generation to generation. I can not belive this place hasn't been on Drive In's, Diners, and Dives, it is a GEM!  I am giving it only 4 stars because of the poor seating, otherwise it would get 5. The neighborhood seems a bit sketchy so this would be a good daytime visit.
