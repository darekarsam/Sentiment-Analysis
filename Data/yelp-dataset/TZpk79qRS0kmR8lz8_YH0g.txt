5	i bought discounted tickets thru yelp and was pleasantly surprisedby the quality of the show.  the host was hilarious , the act s were funny and thrilling along with the up close view.  the comment ongetting vip seats was very good.  The ticketing people were trying to up sell you and made for a much long check in.Theatre seats are bit worn out, but the show was a blast.
2	See my review in there real business area not this attempt to overshadow there real 3 star business... shame on them.
