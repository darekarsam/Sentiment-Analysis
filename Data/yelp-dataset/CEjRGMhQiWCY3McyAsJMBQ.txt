3	I've had good experiences with Uptown Cleaners. I believe they only charge a couple dollars per piece of clothing. But mostly I appreciate their persistence. I dropped off a few sweaters right around the time I was moving to a new apartment. With all the chaos of packing and moving and unpacking, I totally forgot to pick up the sweaters. After a while, they called and reminded me. When I again forgot to pick up the clothes, they called again. I just appreciated the good customer service. I'm sure other dry cleaners might not have been as patient.
1	These guys took ME to the cleaner!I used this dry cleaner for the first time recently, and I was really disappointed.  I knew going in that they were expensive ($2 per laundered dress shirt), but it was a bit of a time-sensitive deal, so I went there, dropped off my shirts and a few suits.When I went back to pick up my stuff, the guy tried to ring me up for a total that sounded higher than it should have.  I asked him to see the itemized bill, he gave it to me, then, without saying anything at all, rang me up again for five dollars less.  No explanation, no apology.No repeat business for these jokers.And by the way, I found a place at Pecan and Central that charges $1.50 for shirts.
