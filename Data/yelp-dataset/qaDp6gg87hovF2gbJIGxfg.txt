5	I came home to a flooded garage floor and a steaming/hissing Water Heater.  I had used this Plumber in the past and always had a great experience.  I called the after hours number and Mary was very kind and walked me through how to find the breaker and turn off the water supply.  She told me the plumber would come out in morning and he did - he arrived right on time.He showed me the hole in the tank and gave me some options.  I elected to let them replace the water heater and bring it up to current code.  I was surprised at how old my Water Heater was  - it's amazing it didn't fail years ago.The complete job took about 3 hours and I felt the price was extremely reasonable.  The work is warrantied for 2 years and I am pleased with this service.  This is an honest plumber who is reasonable.  I highly recommend their services.
1	We used this company through our contractor and had a really bad experience from damage to our ceilings to having them come back at least twice w issues on the proper installation. Mary the operations manager is extremely difficult to work with after all we went through and paid for having no empathy or concern for us and our experience more less doing a good job. The owner seems interested in maintaining a good standard but no one else within the organization. I would not use them.
5	We had a major plumbing problem Super Bowl Sunday at 6:20! We had water flying out of our sewer line in the basement and coming through our shower floor. I had several phone calls out to our builder, plumbers I have used before, and random names I had Googled. There were some companies that wouldn't even help me since I was not an existing costumer....really? All About The Pipes (Dan) was courteous, knowledgeable and came out within the hour...UNBELIEVABLE!  He fixed our immediate problem. Now that's a company to call on again. Thank you!
