4	if you have never been in a big lots you have not missed much in life it is something between a dollar store and a wally-world
3	I cant say that I have experienced better,  I think Big Lots is Big Lots. Big Lots are messy and they are always moving things around on you. Its always a hit or miss. And good luck around the holidays because it is worse.  But for some reason I always find myself making my way to Big Lots maybe to waste time or find that one of a kind lucky butt clearance item.
3	Pros: Lots of cool, inexpensive stuff to browse through and purchase. I found a great price on a covered cake pan (with a handle!!) Also found bedroom slippers and lots and lots of Christmas presents. Cons: Inventory isn't consistent, but then it's Big Lots, it's not supposed to be. It just makes it hard if you bought something there and then you want to go back for some more and it's gone. Also, I bought a large bath/shower gel, but it wasn't put in my bag.
