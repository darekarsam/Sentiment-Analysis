3	The Ballantyne location is in my old neighborhood.  Funny, huh?  Calling Ballantyne someone's old neighborhood...The thing about this place is that it is inconsistent.  Some days everything is just right, better than just right.  Other days its definitely not worth the price, especially for some of their seafood dishes which can reach $20.  The prices are a little higher than the decor should allow, but not so much that I feel robbed.  My guy really loves  a good Reuben or Muffaletta, so we get take out and visit occasionally.  The sandwiches are large, 1/2 order is plenty for one person.  The gumbo is so-so.  The red beans and etouffee are average, but can be good if the chef is on that day.  My recommendation would be to go for the sandwiches if you live in the area and you've had a difficult commute, something quick and not Showmar's...  It's not really a destination if you get my drift.
3	Decent lunch spot to go to with the coworkers.  We always get the fried pickles to start.  Agree with the first review that this place is hit or miss.
3	My advice: get there early and try the Reuben. Nice place for lunch or breakfast.
4	I'm a likttle suprised at the "just OK" reviews for Eddie's Place!  I really like it, and have eaten there probably a dozen times.  Their breakfast is always really good.  I love how they have their standard menu but roll out a daily specials menu which push the envelope of selections.  It's not just your typical breakfast food.  My favorite though, may simply be their chiabata bread french toast.  Possibly the best in Charlotte.Speaking of possiblyu the best in Charlotte...the mufalatta.  Holy cow!  This is worth a long drive to get.  Again for lunch and dinner, I've had very consistent good food and service here.I recommend it!
5	Best breakfast in Charlotte. Burgers, prime rib and seafood gumbo are also excellent.
