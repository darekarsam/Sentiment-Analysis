5	Great place run by a fantastic lady. Handles all the family's hair needs no matter the cut.
5	Have been coming to Amy for over 10 years! She's the only one I trust to cut and style hair for me & my kids. We've gone through a variety of styles, cuts & colors... she's been there every time!She's professional, fun, knowledgeable & sweet. Highly recommend!
5	I just visited Amy for the first time today. The cut is exactly what I had pictured and the color is even better. I appreciated that she showed me the color samples and listened to see what I wanted. Amy is very down-to-earth and personable and an excellent seasoned stylist. I have fine hair and she showed me a few tips and tricks to boost the volume. Not only did I leave feeling like a million bucks, I feel like Amy is someone I would go have drinks with. Bonus!!
