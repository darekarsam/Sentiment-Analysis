5	A great event supporting United Family Services, packing Founders Hall for a gala night of art auctions - both live and silent. Even our own Jared Y. had a picture in the mix. It seemed to keep interested parties bidding, but I don't know the final price.Things definitely went out of my price range rather quickly, but the event itself went off without a hitch, from the red carpet-style entrance to the top-quality food from Aria and Amelie's. Nicely done for a great cause!
4	The Art with Heart Auction was first introduced to me by my good friend, Rachel. I noticed a beautiful piece of artwork in her home and she told me she won it in the silent auction at this wonderful event. I loved the piece and wanted to know more about the event. So after my research and attending this year's events here's what I found out: --artwork is donated by many talented artists across the Southeast and the fundraiser benefits nonprofit organizations (For 2013 it was Safe Alliance formally United Family Services)--It was hosted by Colleen Odegaard and Ramona Holloway of WCNC's Charlotte Today show --This year's fundraiser included an extra special celebration...a new Safe Alliance shelter which allows the organization to help many more people in crisis--Tickets were $100--There were over 100 pieces in the auction (silent and live) so there was sure to be something that fits everyones' artistic style. I know there were a few favorites on my list!
