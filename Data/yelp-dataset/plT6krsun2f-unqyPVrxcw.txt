5	Matt is an excellent insurance agent. He made switching my auto insurance policy to State Farm very easy. He provides great coverage and excellent pricing. I encourage anyone looking for a quote to give Matt Woodford a call today.
5	Just moved to the area and really appreciate Matt's extra effort with our homeowner's policy.  The quote was lower than my military insurance quote.  We also found State Farm Bank to be very user friendly. JNA
5	Wow. Definitely a more personal insurance experience. They took the time to explain all my coverages and taylored my policy to my needs. Great customer service.
