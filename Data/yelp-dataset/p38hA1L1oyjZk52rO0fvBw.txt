4	Excellent ciabatta, great Italian takeout sandwiches.  Excellent fresh and frozen pastas and sauces - brilliant cannelloni!  Catering or takeout.
2	Only had their plain Italian tomato pizza. I'll stick to my usual place I order from on sources. The dough was dry and hard.
4	I have not had their lunch but I can confirm their pasta is very good. Worth a try.
