5	This place is the best auto shop I've ever been to in ALL of Phoenix! I took my car in not even knowing what was wrong with it... all I knew is all the engine lights were on and that bothered me (I know, typical female not taking care of her car) so I took it to to Simon's. Being a woman, I'm always hesitant to visit a mechanic because they mostly try to scam you or have you pay way more than necessary. Simon's was the complete opposite... they were unbelievably honest. He fixed the engine lights, did an oil change, fixed the tires and countless other things. I wasn't even there for 30 minutes and they were done with the car. The staff is super friendly and I can't stress how HONEST they are. It was ridiculously inexpensive too! 5 stars, best mechanic!
5	I can not say enough for how much these guys helped us out in a pinch. Our car happened to break down across the street, and we came to them for advice. They went above and beyond above and beyond. Thank you a million! These guys are trustworthy and then some.
5	We've been to Simons auto repair three times now. This brutal Phoenix heat has taken a beating on our cars. These guys are great! They got us in right away, and don't try to hassle or haggle with you. Honest prices and great service! I can't say enough good about them.
