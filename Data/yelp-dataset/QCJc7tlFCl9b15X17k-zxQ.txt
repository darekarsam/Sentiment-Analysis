4	I'm often surprised by the amount of people inside whenever I pass in the wee hours of the morning, and how quickly I join them.As Amy said, this place isn't cheap. But you're paying for freshness and the mammoth electricity bills this place must have. And unlike there High Street counterpart (overkill for Greggs maybe) the food is actually HOT when you buy it.
3	It is firstly of importance to note that this place cannot really be called a bakery, in that it does not sell bread, but instead acts as a takeaway.  As a result, if you come here to buy some bread you will leave disappointed.  The speciality of this shop is the pies it sells which are of great quality and very tempting.However, in the sober hours of the day this place is purely and simply too expensive and indeed the staff do not expect much business except at peak hours during the day and you can often end up waiting a good while to be served.  Really I don't think this shop does enough to justify the price tags it holds and as a result I cannot recommend it because it isn't value for money.
