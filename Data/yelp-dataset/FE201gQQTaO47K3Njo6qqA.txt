4	5 stars for being Ben & Jerry's, but -1 star for not having a very clean atmosphere. We went here because they are offering a "3 for $3" special (you get three scoops for only $3)! Great deal for Ben & Jerry's ice cream! I ordered Cookies & Cream, Mint Chip, and Cookie Dough. They gave me Cookies & Cream, Mint Chip, Cookie Dough, and some Carmel flavor. Oh well, it tasted ok and for only $3, I can deal with a small mistake! the only problem was the slightly grungy atmosphere that shouldn't be in a B&J's. The floor was quite sticky, the place in general was slightly grimy, and it just lacked that colorful ice cream shop feel. They do have an outdoor patio, though. Overall, definitely a place to go for a good deal!
4	I am a total Ice cream junkie and this spot is superbly located in old port. Everytime after a nice walk around the port or even a dessert after dinner for another small talk you can always find me here. They have nice seating outside their window if you want to check out local artists playing or doing cool tricks outside. The staff here are very knowledgebale and know what flavours works with what if you want to try new blizzards or add/change any flavour to your sundae.
1	The ice cream is amazing, but the staff are a complete and utter disaster.  Worst service I've ever gotten in my life - avoid this place in favor of one of the better managed shops.
