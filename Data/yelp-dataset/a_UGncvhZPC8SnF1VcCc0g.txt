5	Great service!  Very professional and friendly staff. Had horrible experiences with other restaurant supply/consignment warehouses in town. Used them from the beginning to the end.   Bought 75% of our equipment from them and even used their sub-contractors to install everything.   Prices were competitive but  the cleaning and reconditioning they did on every piece saved us valuable time and extra $$.   They also do custom work and have a metal works shop on premise. Items are limited though, and move fast! Wanted a few things and didn't put down a deposit cause we weren't sure on the size of our space, came back 2 days later and they were gone!  Check inventory often. Hope to be opening more stores soon, will def use them for everything!
5	I had a great experience with Golden bar and restaurant equipment . Great prices and I received the items I ordered promptly and with great customer service. Alejandro and Gaby helped me a lot to find what I was looking for and when they delivered the equipment they gave me great feedbacks on how to take care of it to avoid any issue.  THANKS A LOT Golden bar & restaurant equipment. Definitely I will do business again with you.
