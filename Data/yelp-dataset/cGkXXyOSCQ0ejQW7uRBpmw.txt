5	REGULAR MASSAGE SPA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!They have couple massage rooms and 2 table shower room and another room ( I didn't try it and forgot to ask what that room for). One massage bed in my room, and simple but very neat decoration on the wall. I love their room design, small table at the corner.... I wish I could have one room in my house too :)  I love Gina's service, so welcome with soft hands and soft voice. Also, she always smiling.... & never pick up any phone call! Thank you for consider my feeling! woops... I forget to take pictues :(  --- I'll update soon!
1	Really bad service, they don't try to do a good massage, just rubs oil over ur body. Filled with 40+ aged women try to jerk off for u for more tips.... I said no, and they argue with u and complain how other people pay for their hand job....
