4	The drive through is usually fast but the employees came sometimes take too much time for one little thing. I usually don't go to this one even though it is closest to where I live just because i'm a regular at the Wells Fargo by Desert Ridge. It's somewhat easy to find though if you've never been here before.
3	I have been a long time customer of Wells Fargo and and thinking about switching. Their customer service has really changed over the past few years and I don't feel like they will do what they need to meet your needs. I have had then mess up in numerous personal deposits and one very large business deposit that I did. They insisted it wasn't their fault, guess what? We had proof it was. I recently went here for a deposit, the drive thru is always pretty quick but the tellers can have a snooty attitude at this location. I think I'm ready to move on to a new bank.
5	One of the best service I've had with personal Banker, Pranay Naidu.  Friendly, courteous, professional and most helpful. A great start to my day and business.  He not only helped me with my business needs, but also made great suggestions for the future, as my business grows.
5	Love this place, we need to make a deposit employees were friendly and had a positive attitude
