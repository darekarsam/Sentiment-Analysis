5	I purchased 2 mother's day arrangements last week and they were delivered today, with no problems at all.I have purchased from this store before and I must say i am never let down. I love the fruit, it always tastes fresh and I can always count on them being able to accommodate me when I need something that day. Penny the manager is top notch, she is all about customer service and is always willing to work with you as far as special requests go.
1	I had a horrible experience today. Their driver admitted to not reading my delivery instructions and yet they did nothing to rectify the mistake. They ruined a special tradition my husband and I have and I would never use or recommend them. It was a very costly disappointment.
1	The person who ordered this product called and asked about delivery.   They said they would deliver in afternoon.  The person then called them again at 5pm asking where the order was.  They said they were still delivering... It showed up at 5:30pm.  So much for celebrating a birthday when we had to stay home all day to receive this basket of crap!!   Would never do business with this company again!!!  Then I tried to write them a complaint and they they insisted on my phone number.. I do want a call telling me they "feel my pain" and a discount on a future order or...Their will be no future order!!
