4	Nice dog park w/nice ppl. when the dogs run up & down the fence!
5	I absolutely love this dog park.  Parking is simple.  The people are easy going and nice.  Water fountains working, clean, benches, shade.  It's perfect!
3	The parking lot is huge, it's not hard to find a spot, even when there are games going on in the fields next to the dog park.Huge open space, my dog can run free and stretch his legs, I usually have to drag him out of there, he never want's to leave.The reason why I took 2 stars off is this.. There are many ignorant dog owners here, some of these ignorant dog owners will let their dog off the leash and not pay any attention to what their dog is doing at all. My dog has been attacked and mauled by other larger dogs 6 or 7 times while the owners are no where in sight to take control of their animal or they can't take control of their animal when the attacks occur.I have to bring a taser when I come to this park now! If your dog is aggressive or semi-aggressive do everyone a favor and don't bring him to a large park with multiple dogs, it's common sense that it's a horrible idea.
