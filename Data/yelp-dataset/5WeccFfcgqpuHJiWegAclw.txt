4	What a great burger!You get the Super Jumbo with two beef patties and two cheese slices fixedany way you like it for $4.97, plus fries or onion rings.The O rings are excellent.They have great sweet tea.They don't do curb service here.Very casual, easy in and out.Owned by the Original South 21 Drive-In on Independence Blvd, going strong since 1955.
4	I came here for lunch, and since the last time I've came here they changed the menu. For the first time I saw a burger called the 21 express. Three Patties?! ...Umm, I definitely will get that next time. But at first glance I was a little intimidated by the burger. I however decided to get the Double Cheeseburger. And whoa, explosion in my mouth (or a slight clog in my arteries) I felt it. But that's all good, the lettuce and tomato was there to kind of open those arteries.Overall, this place is always busy during lunch time. And I could see why. Cheap prices, homey feel, and the long lineage and history of South 21 gives you the bang for your buck for a fast and tasty meal.
1	I was told the burgers where great here......well last night we gave them a try.   I was not impressed.  We order two jumbo cheeseburgers one with fries, the other with onion rings.  The burgers where BURNT to a crisp.  All the favor of the meat was gone. On a good note the onion rings where great.   Please don't burn the burgers.
3	Visiting friends in NC and we stopped here for breakfast. At first our order was take out but then we decided to eat in. They got out order wrong but was friendly in fixing the error. The food was okay for the items that we got.
3	Always enjoy the burgers and that's about where I call it quits. If you enjoy really good fried chicken, don't order it here! While it has an awesome crisp to it, it has NO seasoning to it. My burger is always how I order and how I like it. Ooey, and gooey, hot and melty cheese. Do wish they had crinkly fries though. Sun drop is on tap...that's a positive!
