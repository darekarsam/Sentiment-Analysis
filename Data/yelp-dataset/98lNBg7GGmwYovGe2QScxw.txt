1	Wow, not the place you want to patronize if you like customer service as part of your shopping experience.  That'll teach me for trying to patronize "the little guy". Unfortunately, that's why they are where they are.
5	Mike and Shane are beyond helpful. Great service, great prices, great product.
1	I just left The Home Depot because -  Basically, the store was just too Big and I could not find what I was looking for... I DID get some help from the Home Depot staff....But, I decided to go to 84 Lumber and get the better experience from a local type store...Unfortunately, my experience at 84 Lumber was Worse! as the staff suggested that I may be a shoplifter... So, I left the store.
