5	I just found this new eatery inside of Spectator's Bar & Grille on the SE corner of Durango & Flamingo! They offer a great casual dining menu. Burgers, pizza, salads and a great selection of appetizers. The Potato Skins were over stuffed with cheese and bacon, deep fried to perfection. I had the Juicy Lucy burger stuffed with Havarti cheese and I ordered Mac & Cheese on the side. Delicious and lots of food. The restaurant is clean, welcoming and the service is friendly and attentive. Looking forward to trying more of the selections on the menu! Check them out.
5	I have had lunch at the food factory twice and the food is great. Everything is fresh and  not your typical bar food.
5	First time eating here and will definitely be back. Had a bacon cheese burger which was amazing ... could tell the meat was fresh ... not your average bun ... french fries were fabulous ... and you actually get a pickle not a sliver of something resembling a pickle but a scrumptious half pickle!! And we had wonderful service.  Cant wait for the next trip and and next menu selections.
5	The Food Factory is becoming one of my favorites. Everything I have ordered has been great.  This isn't your normal bar food. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
