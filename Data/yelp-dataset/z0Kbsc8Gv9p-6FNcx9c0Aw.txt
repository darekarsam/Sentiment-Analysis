4	Just moved to Pittsburgh from L.A. in Aug 2011 & while exploring my new neighborhood stumbled upon this hair salon in Dormont while having breakfast next door @ Dor-Stop. Great haircut by Diane for just $21! I'm very picky about my hair & was nervous about finding a new hairstylist after being loyal to my fab person back in CA since 2002. Very friendly place and Diane is great - she knows what she's doing & will tell you what works best for your hair. Highly recommend!
5	Was traveling through on business- they were able to see me on short notice. Friendly staff and a terrific hair cut!
5	I lived in Pittsburgh for almost 2 years before finally caving and finding a hair stylist locally. I tried out a few places before hearing about Pittsburgh Hair Company from a coworker. I've been going there for the past year for cuts and highlights.  The prices are great and I get SO many compliments on my hair. Linda is the best and I tell everyone I can about her and this lovely little salon!! Plus, they are usually very accommodating with appointments, I often don't make mine until the week-of and they always find time for me!
