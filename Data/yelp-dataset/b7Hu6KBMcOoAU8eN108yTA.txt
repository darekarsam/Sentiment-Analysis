4	Came here for the first time on a Wednesday. For their first Wednesday I thought they did a great job.Band rocked,  service was great and a county bar that played..um..well..you know country music :)We'll be back.
5	Great place.  Went for first time Friday night.  Good atmosphere, good music,  band was even better later in night.  Michelle behind the bar was a lot of fun and even remembered our drinks when we came back the next day.    Good prices as well.   If you like down to earth country fun - you better head down to jus country.
4	Good local honky tonk for drinkin and dancin.Jus Country installed a wood dance floor. It's slightly bigger than Handlebar Js floor and it's better laid out because it's the traditional rectangle shape and doesn't have hindrances like poles.The floor is laid out on bare cement so it's not floating, but I got very controllable sliding with my dance shoes.Free dance lessons make the bar even more fun. Take the free lesson and even if you don't learn much you will get to do some flirting.Seating could be more comfortable. It's all barstools and quite crowded.Tap beer selection is rather bad by today's standards, but typical of a lot of country bars. There is a nice stage for live bands. I have only been there once but the band was OK. At this point I consider JC to be the best honky-tonk in the Valley.
