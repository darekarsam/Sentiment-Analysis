5	Glass Doctor was hired by my property management company to install a new double pane window that was broken in our bedroom.The entire process, from the time my wife talked to Julie, to the second the technician left waving at me from his van it was a 5 star experience.Julie was amazing at setting up the appointments, very prompt, called back right when she said she would! I mean just great customer service. The manager (wasn't able to catch his name) also called 3 days ahead of schedule to let us know there would be a slight delay in the instillation (a whopping 25 minutes).That right there is top notch customer service, and I can't stress enough how much EVERYONE we dealt with actually cared, and did their job great.If i ever have to get glass done again, I would come back to this specific location in a heart beat, even though it is ridiculously out of the way.Would recommend to anyone with any kind of glass issues, literally, any kind. They do everything!
5	These guys were great!!  When my car window was broken, they gave me the lowest quote and showed up when they said they would.  They guy had the wrong glass and he went and got the correct one.  He even worked in the rain.  He worked very neatly and was nice and professional.
