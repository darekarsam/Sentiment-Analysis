5	I'm 32 years old & way too young to be all hobbley woobley and sh*t, but I went in hunched over like Quasimodo from the Hunchback of Notre Dame..... and ready to take drugs to get rid of the constant pain (considering I don't use any prescription or synthetic drugs on purpose-holistic reasons).  Apparently, my sciatic nerve was being pinched by my large fanny.   I was treated so well by ALL the staff, they were incredibly accommodating and pleasant!!!  The treatments were soothing but some hurt like a B**************TCH!!  (I actually cried it hurt so bloody bad)  BUT, there's a magical rainbow ending to this horrific "pain in my butt" - I feel better than I have in a while & I can stand up straight!  I will be back next week to get my "compression" soothing pain on again!  I definitely know I'm on the road to recovery!  AWESOMENESS!!
5	LOVE these guys!! Dr Vaughn treated me durning my pregnancy. Last night I got my first adjustment since having my son and let me tell you I cant remember the last time I slept that well!!! Thank you Dr Vaughn and Dr Nicola ... Ill be sending all my friends and fam your way :)
5	My first week here! And I already feel a lot better. I had extreme back pain. To point I couldn't even sit up or stand for too long and although I still feel pain it's not as bad as it was. I really appreciate their work and help.
