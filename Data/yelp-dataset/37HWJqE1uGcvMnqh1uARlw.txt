4	Next up, there was the Winneburger from the fine folks at Nouveau Palais on Bernard street in Mile End. This old school looking winnebago serves up classic summer BBQ fare - burgers, chips, milkshakes and lemonade. I decided to go for the regular burger and a lemonade to get a sense of their offerings.The lemonade was solid - sweet and freshening. Perfect for the hot summer during which it was consumed. The burger came with cheese, onions, lettuce and a tomato. This was a perfectly executed classic burger. The beef patty was nice and juicy without being too messy to eat on the go. The bun had the right level of crunch on the outside with the nice soft interior. All the vegetables were fresh and classic for a burger. This burger is exactly the kind one hopes for when having a nice BBQ back home. Just a classic item done right. Quite nice.

So sharp, in fact, that all I'm going to talk about is the burger.Small bun? Check. Two patties, bacon, cheese? It's all there. And yet it's one of the quickest food truck eats; a perfect lead-up before you reach for something adventurous. It's everything you want out of a burger fest with half the work.The flip-side, of course, is that if you want to be filled you'll want two. But I say this is burger tapas - meant to be gobbled and savored as you wait out the lineup at a truck or coffee shop.
