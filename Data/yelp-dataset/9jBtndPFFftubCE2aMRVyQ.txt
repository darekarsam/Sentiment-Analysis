5	Ok this one of the reasons I not only live in Las Vegas but that I love Las Vegas. This has been and always will be a city of possibilities. Talk about paying it forward, Rob Roy {the genius (literally) behind the Super Nap Center} has created a space for start-ups to work and collaborate. These kids are brimming with great ideas. We are the next Silicon Valley. My advice to any tech company that was duped into moving to California, pack your bags and come to Las Vegas! No income tax! Free Trade Zone! Very little traffic (compared to California)! And you can afford to buy a house here!If that doesn't persuade you to come here, then perhaps your not as smart as you think you are. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
5	Our tech startup team loves co-working out of this space! The staff is amazing and the facility is incredible. Come visit us!
5	All I can say is...WOW! What an amazing space! I was here this weekend for the #ecet2sw conference.The building has 1 big conference rooms to use and two smaller conference rooms. They have 2 huge projection screens andcwe held a video conference there. Technology well equipped building! WiFi is available. They also have a kitchen space and a perfect catering area! I would definitely recomend getting this space for your next meeting!
