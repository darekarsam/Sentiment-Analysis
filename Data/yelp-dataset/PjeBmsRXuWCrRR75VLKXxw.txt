4	Whilst I certainly advocate the cause for Save The Children, I must say that on a visit there earlier this week it managed to add further weight to my argument that Edinburgh can be quite a perverted city.the lacy corset in the window looked far more apt for a seedy burlesque show at best, a street walker down Leith Docks at worst. In fairness everything else inside was pretty much your usual charity shop standard, but such an item was far from what I expected to see in Save The Children's window. I'm quite old fashioned and think such a store should stock comfy, moth-eaten old cardigans and threadbare cuddly toys.It's all for charity though, so shouldn't complain.
