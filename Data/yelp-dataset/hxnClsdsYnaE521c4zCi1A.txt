1	This was my 2nd try at this salon. The 1st time I wasn't very happy. I had better hair cuts at salons at half the price. The left side wasn't cut the same as the right side, and not evenly tapered. But, I tried for a second time. Big mistake! This cut is harder to manage then the first. She did cut it very fast and I think she wanted to save her self some time by cutting it less layered at the top. This has left my hair wanting to lay too flat on top. Both times I went to this salon I was the stylist's 1st appointment. Both times she was late. She was over 10 minutes late for work and she rushed me out with a speed cut.

1	I wouldn't trust or recommend Eunique Rodgers AT ALL!
5	I was a walk in customer at david and friends, luckily Rylee was available :) she was awesome and loved the way she did my hair! I recommend you to go see her if you're thinking about going. On their website there is also a discount 25% off services :) definitely going back to see Rylee.
5	David and Friends is such a classy salon! All of the stylists were so nice. I loved my haircut and the price was reasonable too!
5	Can someone please tell me what happened to David and Friends?  I am a winter visitor and have been going there for over 7 years.  I called and phone number is out of service.  I then went to salon and it is For Lease with no other information.
