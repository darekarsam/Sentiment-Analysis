2	This was the lowlight of my trip to Montreal, a foodie city. Came here Saturday for lunch, and stood around for a good 40 minutes without anybody acknowledging my presence. The guy who should have been at the host stand was busy running around. I understand they are super-busy around that time, but at least he could have came & gave me an estimate on the wait (especially since he walked past me numerous times). This was especially unforgivable when they had a small table available in the back of the dining room!Nonetheless I stayed for the food. The price was decent, but the food didn't make up for the neglecting service. The cauliflower curry soup was watery and had so much curry flavor it completely overshadowed the "cauliflower", if there was any. The broiled fish was cooked well, but lacked seasoning. So I guess the kitchen made up for that by making the sauce extra salty. The risotto it came with tasted only like chicken broth. To add insult to injury, the food looked like it sat under the warming lamp too long: a skin had formed on the sauce and the mashed sweet potatoes had a dried surface. Dessert (cinnamon & rum creme brulee and rhubarb sorbet with baked meringue) was decent. The only thing good was my server, who took the time to introduce my dishes when they came out.While the price was great, the food was only so-so, and the service at the host stand completely turned me off. Definitely NOT worth returning given the wide selection of amazing restaurants in Montreal.
