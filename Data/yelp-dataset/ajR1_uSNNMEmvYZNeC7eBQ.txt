1	I stopped in to use the bathroom. Disgusting. A swarm of flies and a filth. I will never come here again.
3	Why review a Wendy's? Aren't they all the same? Well no that's not true. Plus it's Sunday morning and I'm catching up on my Yelpings.Open til 2 am. Lots of chicken nuggets. This one seems to have faster service than most late-night fast food joints. Happy Maher. Good morning.
3	Drive thru open late!! The drive thru is always super efficient! I do not think I have ever been inside this particular store, but the outside is always clean.
