5	Have been searching for great soups like this for 15 years only to find it in Laval!   The Thai spicy soups are so flavorful, just the best.    Since I live in Laval, this is a great option where we don't have to drive into the city for good pho.
4	Inexpensive, large portions and so far I've been pretty satisfied with what I've tried (Pad Thai, chicken fried rice, won ton soup, imperial rolls).
3	The soups are good although I find there wasnt enought meat in the raw beef and meat balls soup. I strongly dont recommend the spring rolls, very oilly and no texture.
