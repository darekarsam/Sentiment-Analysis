4	I walked in this bakery for the first time looking for coffee as I work around the corner. As soon as I passed the door, the aroma and the sight of the pastries instantly sent a wave of happiness in me. Initially, I was searching for regular coffee, but when the time came to place my order, I was told only special coffees could be prepared. I ended up ordering a cappuccino with soya milk. And to reach a 5$ minimum in order to pay with interact, I ordered a sweet little something. Out of a pool of delicious-looking baked goods, I chose an almond paste croissant. I was thrilled with my choice. Though, it is not cheap (the coffee and the croissant came up to about 7$), you will not be disappointed with the heaven of sweets that awaits you.
