5	Mike @ magic bumper is a really honest guy. His work Is excellent and his prices are the LOWEST anyone could possibly find around Las Vegas.He fixed my bumper just like nothing had ever happened to it., BRAND NEW !!!!Couldn't be any happier .
5	Mike went above and beyond what we asked him to do. His prices were very reasonable. He was extremely friendly and his craftsmanship is excellent!!
5	After getting several quotes from several different places around town about scratches on my bumper and the side of my car I was going to give up as the quotes were outrageous! I ended up finding Mike at Magic bumper who gave me the best quote of all! I took my car in to him (on his off day) and he repaired my bumper like new in 1 hour!! I highly recommend Mike to anyone needing auto body repairs!
