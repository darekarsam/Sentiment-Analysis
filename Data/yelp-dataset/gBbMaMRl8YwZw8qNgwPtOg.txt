3	Newsflash Wine Studio.  There are more wines in this world aside from Merlot, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc!We went into the Wine Studio for the 50% sale and found the selection to be incredibly meager.  Albarino?  No.  Grenache?  No.  Cava or Prosecco?  Nope....but they have Andre!  Maybe it was just because of the sale and the inventory hadn't been restocked but it was very disappointing.  My husband did find a 12 year old bottle of Mondavi Fume Blanc (he has some obsession with Mondavi Fume Blanc....he went to the winery once and sampled it and loved it....) which we purchased just because but it has this orange-tang colored hue to it so we'll see how it turns out.There are tables and couches there if you want to eat in as a cafe but I'm not sure if I would go back for that.  I did enjoy that the Temple basketball game was being shown though!  Go Owls!
4	The Wine Studio is now "Fired Up", fyihttp://www.yelp.com/biz/fired-up-scottsdale#hrid:Gr3IeqT9YIgarxd9FqDd-w
1	The Wine Studio was great while it lasted but closed several years ago. Other places tried and closed. Fate Brewing has the space now and is a great replacement...particularly if you like beer. But the Wine Studio should be deleted from this listing.
