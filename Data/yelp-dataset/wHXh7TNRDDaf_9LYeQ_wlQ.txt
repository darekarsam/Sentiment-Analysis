5	Yesterday marked my 4th year having my eyes examined by Dr. K. (they call him Dr. K because people have trouble saying Khoshnevis).  He explains eye care in easy to understand terms! Dr. K and his staff are the Best!  They are friendly and show great care!
3	Very nice location!Everyone from the front desk to the doctors make sure to take their time with you! They all make sure you understand everything they are doing and ensuring the best eye care possible. The front desk receptionist went over my bill in detail and explained how I could get my rebate for ordering from that location, also the doctors went over the importance of eye care.What I liked most was that you were able to see all your results right then...seeing your entire eye from inside is weird and amazing at the same time! Also, they request a follow up appointment if you get contacts just to ensure the proper prescription and fit. At no charge!The only reason I didn't give more stars was the wait was extremely long both times I've been to visit, but overall I was pleased with the level of service and the location so I will be back.
5	Yet another great visit at Carolina Family Eye Care. The entire staff, starting from Dr. Khoshnevis is always phenomenal to deal with. The have such great energy and truly go out of their way to take care of you that no matter what time of the day you visit them you are bound to leave the place with a great smile on your face. I have and will continue to recommend them to all my friends, family and loved ones.
