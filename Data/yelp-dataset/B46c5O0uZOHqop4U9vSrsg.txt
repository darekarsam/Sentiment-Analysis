5	Great pastries and friendly service.  A great escape from chain coffee shops.
4	Every neighbourhood deserves a place like thisWhen I come to Montreal, I always stay with my friend Ross, who lives a block from here and it's always nice to wake up early and head over here for some great coffee and a loaf of fresh bread. The coffee is fair trade, which starts the day off right, with a blessing of all that we enjoy and our responsibility to help others.There are many things to-go, including sandwiches, salads. And fresh bread has a taste no packaged bread can compete with --one reason for the "french paradox--less is more--less quantity, more quality.In my e-book, Food for City Building, I talk about the centrality of such "butchers and bakers and candlestick makers" to neighborhood cohesion and health, and that exists on many levels -- from the nutrition of the food to the ability to navigate a neighborhood and have a sense of place and belonging. That's why every neighborhood needs a bakery like this.
4	Great spot for a coffee and food. Coffee was fantastic and pastries also very tasty. Great range of bread also available. Definitely worth a visit
