5	I've been remiss in writing reviews for this wonderful little shop of fragrances, soaps, and beauty and bath supplies.  Each time we enjoy Otto at the Venetian, we always stop by Acca Kappa to stock up on supplies.  The Green Mandarin hand soap is a staple in our bathroom.  I fell in love with the 1 shampoo and conditioner (for normal hair) and was giddy when it was on sale for 50% off.  Then crestfallen when I was informed that line is being phased out.  I hope I love the next line just as much.There's a men's cologne, 1869, that is wonderful and they have a line of 1869 deodorant, lotion, and cologne.I've slowly been buying their makeup brushes, since they are pricey.  I've never had quality makeup brushes in my life, so this is a real treat.  Same with the bath sponge.  I've purchased sponges before, but the quality of their sponges is far and above anything else I've ever tried.Love this place, and agree with Ryan - the pretty boxes of soap make a wonderful gift!
1	I am so upset with Russel, from the Las Vegas Store. I recently bought a wooden brush when I was in Las Vegas last month. Some of the bristles started to fall out already, so I contacted the store to see what they could do. The gal I spoke to there was very nice, and told me her Manager (female) would call me. I received an email from Russell (not sure if he is the owner as he would not tell me). He asked for a picture, which I emailed. He then told me he would need to contact Acca Kappa Italy and for me to mail the brush to Italy! Are you kidding me? What kind of Customer service do they offer their customers? I am very UNHAPPY with Russel's communication.
5	Great hairbrushes - they will last for years. I also had a large bottle of shampoo 1 - it lasted for years and it so gentle that I do not need a conditioner. Their white moss perfume is very subtle and marketed as unisex. I carry it in my car when I need a quick spritz.
