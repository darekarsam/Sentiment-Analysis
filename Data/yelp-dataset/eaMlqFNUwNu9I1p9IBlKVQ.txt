2	It's unfortunate that I had a bad experience with this company.  I had purchased some items from them and one of them happened to be too small.  I've tried calling and left messages and still no reply.  At this point, I've given up trying to exchange the item.
5	Good guys. Just ask for Stu and he'll take care of you. I've used them for several clients already (restaurant, construction) and not a problem. They let you know how long it takes and they've always hit the mark for me.
5	I was working on a  white party for Patrick Kelley Youth Foundation. Stu and his team were recommended by another non-profit. We wanted to do fedoras with our logo. Stu and I worked via email as we both were traveling. He kept in contact and worked hard to stay on budget and task. We had problems with some vendors but down to the end he did his very best to make this happen. He went above and beyond to make sure we were happy and on time. We are so thankful on how amazing everything turned out! I would recommend him and his staff to anyone! We will definitely use him again.
