5	Awesome restaurant! Casual setting with great views of the lake from more than 8 floors up. Great views of the lake. I had a Rueben and my mom got the falafel salad which was the food choice to get. The french fries were alright albeit a little crispy and a little more couldn't have hurt. All in all it's a great place with fantastic attentive service
5	The food was excellent. The Ruben had huge chunks of local corn beef!! The hamburger was excellent as well. Highly recommend this place.  Oh and the view of the lake is cool.
5	Stumbled upon this outdoor cafe after watching the Mad-City ski team out on Lake Monona. If you're looking for a quick bite accompanied with a lovely view, I highly recommend eating here.Standard menu consisting of burgers, sandwiches and of course, beer. I ordered the chicken sandwich, which comes with homemade chips, and it came out in a jiffy.
5	Wow, we were needing to eat lunch anyways before our tour of Monona Terrace.  So, we got this as a recommendation from the front desk.  My girlfriend and I had the fish tacos and soup of the day which was red pepper parmasean.  We finished it together and enjoyed every bite.  We were served quickly and felt like it was a definite step up of other museums.  It was soo good that we came back for dinner to see the water skiing competitions.  I had the BLT salad with fried egg and my girlfriend had the falafel salad.  She felt a bit too much with the taziki salad dressing but I thought it was fine but a bit too much cucumber.  Mine was perfect and the egg was nice over a crisp bread piece.  Price is very reasonable and don't have to wait for a table.  Lunch was about $10 and dinner was closer to $20.  Enjoy a nice view while having lunch or dinner.
5	Beautiful on a sunny day. Excellent outdoor patio. Food is amazingly good for a walk up window. We all had the chicken sandwich. Very tasty!
