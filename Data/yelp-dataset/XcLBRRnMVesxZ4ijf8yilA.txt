5	When I went to school back in the 80's. This was my source of meals! Had a very tight budget, hardly had any money. But on my way home I would stop off here and buy two whoppers for 99 cents! That's right only 99 cents. I probably ate there 5 days a week. So I'm just rating this place for keeping me full!
3	I found myself near this BK outpost  the other day and hungry.  I knew they were again running their buy one, get one free offer on the original chicken sandwich so that is what I got.  I got them to go. The order came up quick and was correct.  The way this older unit was built the dining area is sort of around the corner from the order window so I cannot comment on it.
1	Just came back from there ordered two for five two fries nugget special....no nuggets i was the only one in drive thru. I worked for bk fifteen yrs but really? We got the sauce though. My manager would've been po'd . Thanks Amanda the cashier and whoever expidited the order
