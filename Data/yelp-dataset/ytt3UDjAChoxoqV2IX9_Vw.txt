5	I absoulutely love shopping here!! Everytime i walk in im greeted, but not in a pushy sales way. Everyone is so nice and the inventory is gorgeous! Its a clean store and they always have a sale wall which is nice because Micheal Kors is not ALWAYS in everyones budget. Will be back soon for my next purse! I wish i could work here!!
5	I had two awesome experiences at this store. First, when I went in to make my purchase, Josh was awesome and made great recommendations. I had my two year old niece with me and the staff was completely accommodating as I was trying to make my decision. Second, I had come across some scratches on my beautiful new bag which I was totally devastated about. I took it in in hopes of getting an exchange and yet again the staff took care of me no questions asked! I will definitely be adding some Michael Kors items to my Christmas list this year.
