1	Dominos had a deal for $6 medium pizza, which I thought was a good deal and you get two toppings. Went to pick it up and they should have just said $6 small pizza, the box was a small. It serve probably 3 people if they all had 3 pizza each. When I went to pick it up the guy was on his cellphone, but don't worry he was nice enough to put his phone down when I came in. Not worth the savings.
5	Love to be able to create your own pizza. Light sauce and cheese. Fast only 20 min.
3	Love the pizza, but it's inconsistent.We order from here about every other week. The online ordering process is great and the delivery drivers are always nice. The only problem we have is, we order the new "handmade" pizza with 2 toppings of pepperoni and extra cheese. The "handmade" is ALREADY supposed to have extra and even when ordering that pizza with extra cheese, we get air bubbles with no cheese on at least 2 pieces per pizza.
3	We ordered for delivery and was impressed at how fast they were. Love the ease of website ordering and the order tracker however I do feel if a company cannot do as much as provide peppers and cheese at no charge,  they are not worth my business.  I can definitely pay $1.25 each for peppers and cheese, but I would rather give my business to a company who is at least thoughtful enough to not take advantage of their customers by charging for something a little a peppers and cheese.
