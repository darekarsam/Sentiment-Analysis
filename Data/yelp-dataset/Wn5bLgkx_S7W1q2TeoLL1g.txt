3	Since moving to dormont, I've been here few times for darts and drinks. This place is divided into a bar (in the front) and a huge pool hall at the back along with a single dart board (manual) which is the only reason we come here every once in a while. Although you're not allowed to smoke in the pool hall - the hall reeks of cigarette smoke residue. So, do be prepared to take a shower and do the laundry as soon as you get home.Besides, that - I think it's a pretty cool hang out place if you're into pool. The people here are friendly, the service has been good so far and the prices for the drinks are super reasonable.
5	My favorite place to relax after a long week at work.  Real people working there that are friendly and welcoming.  While you're there check out the rest of Dormont and enjoy a great pint or two.
1	Pool hall and pretty crappy bar. Not much else to write home about. Was not a fan and won't be back here.
