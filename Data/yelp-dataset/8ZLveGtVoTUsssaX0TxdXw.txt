2	I'll drive to Concord and wait in long lines for Popeye's or even look like a fool and visit the one inside the food center at Winthrop. They used to have spicy chicken because Texas Pete just doesn't do it for me.  Why is this such a difficult concept?At least their breakfast is OK if you get it fresh.  I always try to order a biscuit I don't see already prepared and sitting in the holding bins.  They also honor their coupons unlike the rude staff that is dismissive at the one across from SouthPark stating "we don't have to being a franchise."
1	Seriously. Dumbest human beings alive. They could not comprehend anything about taking, putting together and serving anything. If I could give them negative stars I would.Bojangles HQ needs to seriously re-train and re-staff this location.
1	Did this girl really just grab my food with her bare hands? I threw my food out. Disgusting!! Do not eat here!
4	Bojangles serves a very delicious Biscuits. What I love is their Sausage and Egg Biscuit. The egg was perfectly cooked to match with the delicious Sausage. I also loved their Grilled Chicken Sandwich, the grilled chicken was great, I love eating it.The people at the kitchen were very nice, they offer a replacement on my Sausage and Egg Biscuit because they had a mistake on it.Would really love to dine here with friends and family. Recommended!
3	I drove by a Bojangles and had no idea what it was. The colors got me thinking of Pollos Hermanos and honestly I wouldn't be surprised if it was a front. The fried chicken reminded me of Popeyes and Churchs combined. It wasn't the best but not the worst. The $5 deal for 2 pieces + 1 side + drink was pretty decent but I think if you are hungry it will not be enough food.
