5	We had Majors Mobile do an interior detail on our car, and they did a terrific job.  The work was done with attention to detail, he did not rush through it, and the results were beautiful.  I will definitely call them again, and highly recommend them.
5	I have 4 boys majors mobile had my minivan looking brand new. Absolutely loved the friendliness of the staff and the quality of work.
3	I got a $139.99 mobile interior and exterior detailing deal through Amazon Local for $67, but I was still expecting the $139.99 value to be received and it wasn't, in my opinion. The car looked pretty decent, clean for the most part. There were some big spots missed on the interior (door handle) and there were a lot of smudges of wax left on the exterior. If it was a $67 package, I'd be okay with it, but it wasn't. It was a $139.99 package and I expected that level of quality.Also, the guy, while really polite and friendly, was an hour late for the appointment. He explained that the previous appointment added services on, but I fail to see how that's my problem. While it still worked out timing wise, I don't think you keep a client waiting because someone else wanted something additional they didn't set up an appointment for. For the money I spent, the job was fine. But I still paid for a package I don't think I got value for. I won't be scheduling another appointment with them as I'd rather just pay the $200 for the dealers to do it well.
