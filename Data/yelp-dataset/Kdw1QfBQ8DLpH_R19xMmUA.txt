5	Great place!  Friendly staff and the doctor is patient and very knowledgable
5	I found this practice based on my insurance and proximity to where I live. The location is right off of the 101 and 51-- super convenient and easy to find. I was seen as a new patient and got an appointment for about a week out. Dr. Siegel was so friendly and personable, and was the first doctor I've ever had who took the time to explain all the equipment and processes to me. The appointment was so quick and painless!I highly recommend this place.
1	I called and spoke to the receptionist at North Phoenix Eye Care. She had a bad attitude, and seemed confused on which Insurance companies they accepted. Her bad attitude alone, was enough for me to continue my search for an eye Doctor.
5	After being a life-long chain eyecare customer (Nationwide, Lenscrafters, Eyemasters, etc), I finally decided to go with North Phoenix Eye Care because I now have vision-specific insurance, and these folks take it.Right off the bat, everything went well: appointment was made, then, on Friday, I got a call that they had an opening the next day that I could take if I wanted. Awesome!Show up for my appointment and my Dr, Chelsea Crandell, is just plain awesome. That perfect blend of professionalism and personality to make me feel both at-ease (which I need when somebody's holding a metal device 1" from my eyeball) and comfortable that she knows what she's doing. Every step of the way she kept me informed on what she was doing and seeing and very informative on what my options are.I really can't recommend these folks enough. And I'm never stepping foot in a chain store again.
