4	They got great service but they have slow wifi download rate......down is 1.10 mps and up is 0.60 mps .... That sucks... Lol
1	Ok look, I KNOW this is McDs so my expectations aren't high to start with. But today was the last time I'm ever going there. The last 3 times either my food is cold, they mess up the order or the fries are stale. Today they couldn't even make a sundae! I got a cup of milky watery crap with a teaspoon of hot fudge. Tried one bite and threw it out just like my other visits. Go to the one a little North on Val Vista instead.
1	Its way too cold in the dining room. I cannot even enjoy the free WiFi because I am freezing. They should offer free hot chocolate because of the icy temp inside. What we need is heat not cold...its cold enough outside...
1	Sitting in the drive thru long enough to write a review. First I waited long enough that by the time I got up to the box to order bfast was over. Since I have ordered I have been waiting.. At the box......  For 9 min!!! If you are not ready to serve lunch then serve what you got! Still have not moved by the way
