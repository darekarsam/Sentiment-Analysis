5	This is one of the best barber shops I have been to in years. I actually would get my haircut once a week every week and I relocated to Tucson and when I was in the area I actually stopped in. I will recommend them to anyone looking for a "real" Barber Shop. Keep up the great work fellas.
5	Great group of guys who make the experience great, as for the cut it was spot on..payed close attention to detail and took no short cuts. They gave me exactly what I want at an affordable price!
5	After going to a chain barber shop over the years and deciding I was tired of my typical "run-of-mill" cut, I looked around for a new place that would do a true barber cut that took a little time instead of someone that wasn't trying to push me out the door in 5 minutes with a cut I could've done myself at home, and also offer a great neck shave.  I tried out another place in Chandler before this one that claimed this was their thing, only to be disappointed with about the same quality cut as a chain, and costing $25 more than it was worth.Enter Country Clipper.  These guys know what they're doing, and take pride in their work doing awesome cuts.  It's nice to know I'll leave with a great cut every time instead of the inconsistency you might find at some of the chains.  I always get a nice neck shave to top it off that shows their attention to detail every time.    I could go on and on about what makes this place great - give them a try, you won't be disappointed.
5	Just what I was looking for.  Scott was attentive and professional, and I walked out with a great haircut.
