4	I love this nail salon compare to some other ones that I have been to. This salon stole me from Aloha Nails and never will I go back! I get great service at My Bella Spa and my nails always look professionally done, they do get busy so if you don't have much time just schedule an appointment but they welcome walk-ins just be prepared to wait sometimes, but its all definitely worth it!
1	Went in for a good pedicure and manicure. I signed in, requesting a spa pedicure and manicure. Start to finish, it lasted 30 minutes, total. I did not get the salt as rub that they told another customer was included in the spa pedicure. They did not even attempt to ask if I wanted paraffin or any additional services (which I would've definitely done). My nails had leftover acrylic on them...did they even attempt to get it off? Nope. Apparently a client they were more familiar with walked in, and they were in a hurry to get to her. Shame, bc I was ready to spend $100 in there. I've heard bad things about this place before but thought I'd give it a try anyway....wish I hadn't.
1	We were seated immediately but sat with our feet in the water for 15 minutes without anyone saying a word to us. After our water got cold, we ended up just getting up and leaving. It wasn't until that time anybody said anything to us. Poor service. Would NEVER go back.
5	I held a mother/daughter spa birthday party for my 4 year old daughter today...they did an excellent job accommodating all of us and making it extra special for the little girls...they took their time and really pampered all of us...it was a great experience...will definitely go back!
