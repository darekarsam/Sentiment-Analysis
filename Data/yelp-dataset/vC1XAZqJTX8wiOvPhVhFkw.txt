5	I blew a tire last night, around 10:30PM.  It was cold, miserable...thank god I had picked up one of Stu's cards at the yamaha dealership.  I called Stu, he answered by the third ring, and I asked if he could come out and get my bike.  He said yes, and came out immediately.  He arrived about 17 minutes later.  He loaded up my bike, recommended a repair shop, and since they weren't open, offered to store my bike at his place overnight, and then drop it at the repair shop the following morning.Great customer service, the tow fee was....hmmm...competitive, but still expensive in my opinion.  I would certainly user  him again in the future, (fingers crossed that i don't ever have to of course).
5	st night my old Vespa was having problems with its breaks. The thing was unsafe to drive and I was tired. I have roadside assistance through the American Motorcycle Association so I called in and they sent out Stu. I have to say Stu was awesome. He arrived quickly and my bike was loaded and home within the hour. He was very polite and friendly. The lift that he has on his truck is pretty badass too.  I'd call him again for sure and recommend him to all my buddies. Thanks Stu!
5	Great service, great pricing, and his truck is awesome, even has nice cushy straps.  I highly recommend Stu for motorcycle towing
5	Quick easy and painless!  I have a custom chopper with a springer front end and lots of chrome.  Stu's setup is the best I've ever seen.  Limited to one bike at a time (I think) but very quick and very gentle!  Padded straps and a great attitude by Stu!  He takes his time to pamper your sled!  I will call him again if I ever need another tow, and recommend him to all riders!
