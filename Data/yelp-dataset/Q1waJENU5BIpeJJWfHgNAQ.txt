2	I've shopped here off and on over the years. I was shocked when I went in this morning to find that the prices went up - and not by a little. Some of the toys I saw there cost more at abig Lots as the same toys at Target or Walmart. Ive never seen that before at this store. The store is stocked full and is so disorganized. If I am going to spend that amount, I might as well go to Walmart or Target and have an easier return policy should anything need to be returned. Sure, there are little things there that you can't fid anywhere else, and that is the bonus. But the downside, the lines. One cashier per shift. Now that the snowbirds are back, it's not worth it.
1	Beware!  I called the store before I drove down to double check the prices on student notebooks.  The clerk who answered assured me that I can still get notebooks for .17 cents each.  I was even assured there's no purchase limit (teacher).   So I drove down and the prices changed to .90 cents each.  I asked why and if they would honor the lower price since I just called AND spoke to someone less than 15 minutes ago. ...the clerk just shrugged her shoulders and said, no.  Be Careful!   I used to love this store and shop here but now they have lost a loyal customer!!!!
1	Absolutely the most rude manager. I returned a floor power cleaner because when I opened the box the nozzle was full of hair & dirty. The manager said well this has been used. If she would have looked at it she would have realized it came that way. She was very rude to me and finally returned my money. I will NEVER shop there again !
