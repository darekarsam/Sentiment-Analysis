4	We love coming to this place with our girls. They have tons of different flavors and are constantly adding new. The condiments are always clean and fruits fresh. Good customer service. And the establishment is always clean.

2	Typically TCBY is my go-to for fro-yo. I've visited several in the charlotte area, the one off South being my fav, however this one severely lacks in the cleanliness dept comparing to others. Yogurt is good, toppings good. Machine acted and sounded like is was about to break down and girl working was too busy chatting with her own girlfriend who was here visiting her. The anti-bac machine they have was broken so she told me that we could wash our hands in the bathroom...well...girls bathroom soap machine is broken too! So after telling her that she tell me and my young daughter we could use the men's (wth!) go to the men's bc I don't want to make my food with dirty hands and the bathroom is disgusting with hair and smells everywhere! Don't touch anything and wash hands. Come out, make fro-yo. Girl ringing is up asks if soap worked in the men's b-room worked ok? Haha really? I encouraged her to clean the bathroom. Please invest in $1 soap and anti-bac from Target to keep for women so we don't have to be subjected to your dirty men's room and clean more often. Thanks.
