5	Love the yogurt there =) makes me feel less guilty when i eat yogurt!
5	THE BEST YEH! SHOP IN MONTREAL!There's less people than the Eaton Center one and the Guy-Concordia one, and it's spacious, well decorated and comfortable. My friends and I have designated it our go-to hang out spot. VIVA YEH
1	Kinda a sad chain of frozen yogurt. Given the location of this specific store, you can't take it seriously either. It's nestled in a shady part of town, rampant with places called "Sex Village" and "Boutique Erotika". It's half a block away from a grimey strip club and surrounded by open late fast food joints fitting for the degenerate crowd wandering this sad street block.It simply does NOT compare to U.S. Red Mango and Pinkberry chains, or even any of the smaller lesser known chains. I sampled each flavor out of curiosity and each couldn't have been any more artificial. I would definitely not shell out any money out of pocket if you're visiting Montreal. I'll say the cashier was nice enough to give us multiple small sample paper cups, but the flavors are artificial and nothing special.
