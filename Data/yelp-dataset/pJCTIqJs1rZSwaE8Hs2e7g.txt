4	Stayed for two nights in October. Free street parking, but you may have to circle a bit and be careful to read house numbers and map with free parking provided by owner. Owner was upfront about our room being above a bar with lots of goings on throughout Friday night.  It was a warm night, we slept with the windows open and it was a rather eventful night at the bar judging from the noise level. Saturday was a lot quieter probably due to heavy rain. Bed was very comfy. Breakfast lovely with freshly baked croissants, pancakes, great selection of jam/jellies,  the best coffee and plenty of fresh fruit.  The house itself has a lot of ambiance. This is not the place for everyone, but if you are open for a bit adventure, then go for it!  I  would come back, but I would ask for a room that is not facing the bar.
5	The owner greeted me by name when I ringed the doorbell because I was checking in towards the end of check-in times. He was very accommodating and informational, and sat me down with a map of Montreal to tell me exactly what was in each neighborhood. Our room had 2 double beds and a bathroom. The quaint room was very comfortable with AC control and a big screen TV. For breakfast, we got omelettes and croissants with fresh fruit every morning and the omelette chefs were very friendly. The location is very close to the Metro and there's a Bixi bike dock right outside the door. We would come back again when visiting Montreal.
