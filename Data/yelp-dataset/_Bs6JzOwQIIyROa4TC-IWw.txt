4	I have an older Acura.  The R12 needed replaced in the air conditioning. John at Auto Tune said they carried R12 but it was really expensive.  He told me they had a similar product, Freeze12, that would work just as well at a fraction of the cost.  They also looked at some other issues on the vehicle.I was impressed that they offered alternatives that were much less expensive.  I would not have known there was an option to R12, and they could have charged me a much higher price.John was friendly and helpful and I will make the drive to take my vehicle there again.
4	Great shop with a good group of Mechanics.  I've taken quite a few cars there. Support your local shops and still get it done cheaper.
5	Best auto repair shop in the valley!   Derrick & his mechanics have been is business for over 22 years!  They won't charge you added fees other shops charge & do excellent work!  They work on foreign cars but won't charge you foreign prices :). See Derrick today!
5	Highly recommend the Auto Tune team!   You can count on them to be fair & honest in their pricing.   The service is always done quickly and done well.   One of the greatest fears is hoping to find an auto shop that you can trust & I'm happy to have found one.
5	Car drives like new, service was pleasant and fast!Will be back!
