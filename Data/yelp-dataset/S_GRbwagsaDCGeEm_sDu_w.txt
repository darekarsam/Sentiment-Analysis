4	Le Cupcake Shoppe specializes in selling delectable, mini cupcakes ($1 each or $10 per dozen).The owner, Alexandra, and her mother are fantastic and are truly vested in their small business. The little shop is cute, with pops of color throughout. I purchased a variety of mini cupcakes. Each were delicious, but the salted caramel stood out the most. Le Cupcake Shoppe is conveniently located on the south side of the Liberty Tunnel.
4	This is a cute little cupcake shop that just opened in Brookline on Capital Ave. The only problem I had was with the pricing, which is a little high. Other than that, the cupcakes are very good, and the pink boxes they use are so adorable, I kept one (I prevented Darren from throwing it out, I might need it for arts and crafts).
4	Got an assortment of 12 cupcakes for my sister in law for her birthday.  She loved them!  They flavors were fun and diverse.  They owner and her mother were super friendly.  They will do special order and cake pops.
5	what an amazing Pittsburgh business!  The sweets are amazing and the staff is friendly!
