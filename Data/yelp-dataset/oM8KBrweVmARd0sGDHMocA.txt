5	This food is Great! Freshly cooked, nothing microwaved like most trucks I have eaten from. Try out the burger and empanadas!!! I promise, you won't be disappointed.
5	Hey if you want to get some really tasty, freshly made food look for the N.Y. Owned Purple Truck!  this is the best food for your buck! Colombian empanadas, bklyn burgers and much much more.YUMMMMMMMM
5	I stumbled upon this food truck earlier this evening. Hands down, the best food I've ever gotten from a truck and much better than food you usually get at sit down restaurants. The Colombian empanadas were spectacular! Wonderful flavors, fresh, and not greasy at all. If Carh's kitchen is at the same location next Friday, I'll be there. I'm so impressed!!
5	Very good food, service was orderly and courteous. More food trucks should be like this!
4	When you see that purple food truck, stop and grab some awesome gyros. They call it the Queens gyro. The price is reasonable compared to other food trucks and definitely worth the cost. Made with fresh ingredients and an explosive taste, I would definitely recommend them! With Dave manning the cooking and his wife Pat taking orders, they are friendly and they do make you feel at home, even standing on the sidewalk waiting for food.
