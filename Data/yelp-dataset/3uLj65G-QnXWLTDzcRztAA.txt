5	A completely brilliant store with literally...everything medical... you might ever need or ever imagine you might need (and dear lord, I hope not), but most importantly, a knowledgeable, helpful owner and staff who genuinely seem to care...
1	Customer service SUCKS!!!! Don't ask if they have restrooms" it's not for the public" but they want you to shop here! Thank Goodness there are other medical supply stores in the area.
5	This place has everything to fulfill your medical needs! Great service & a huge thanks to the employee who had assembled my purchase!
1	I'll never give this sham business my money again despite it being very close to my office! Their customer service always below average like their prices but today crossed a line. I needed 2 rolls of exam paper at 930 and was basically told to get to the back myself for it while the worker did paperwork! This paperwork crap continued as myself and elderly man buying walker were waiting 5-6 minutes while 2 workers said nothing to us, doing paperwork! Finally a third worker began checkout, I had $13 ones and a hundred dollar bill, my total was $15. I was told they didn't have change and I could wait for manager to return from bank, and some excuse about how they only opened at 9, but that'd be a reason to have change right?! All that time and frustration and no ability to complete purchase with ease??? Moral of the story save your aggravation and pay a few bucks more ANYWHERE ELSE
