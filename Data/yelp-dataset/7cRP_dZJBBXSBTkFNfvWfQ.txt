5	I have tried several yoga studios in the Charlotte area and this studio is by far the best. The vibe in undeniable and the instructors are extremely helpful. There's a great balance between challenging vinyasa classes and restorative/calming classes. I would recommend this studio to anyone who is looking for an awesome yoga experience.
5	Gotta Yoga is a great place to practice yoga in Charlotte. It's a very welcoming studio, with friendly instructors, and is great for both beginner's and experienced yogis. If you have a chance to meet Kim, the owner, you'll understand why the studio is such a warm, inviting place.
5	Damn right as good as it gets... So reppin' for Yelp I went to the Yelp class about a month ago and forced my best friends to go with me so I wouldn't make a complete fool of myself alone. I really didn't know what to expect, but hell an excuse to try something new, rock some yoga pants and have a few laughs with my friends ... why not? Since then, I have had the chance to take everything from beginners Yoga to Hot Yoga and while it kicks my ass, I some how keep going back for more. The classes are wonderful, the teachers are very helpful and understanding. The place has a great vibe that just makes you unwind and focus. Most of the time I can't even tell the room is 90 degrees because I'm so into the class. If you don't want to shell out money for a pass, you can attend some 'community classes' for 5 dollars. It's a great way to find out if Yoga is a good fit,.
5	Nice spacious practice area. I've taken classes from 5 different teachers here. Enjoyed every one!
5	Love this studio.  The atmosphere is calming and the studio is clean.  There are no mirrors on the walls, so it's a good place to get out of worrying about what you or anyone else looks like.  The instructors are all different, so you will find your favorites!  But overall, everyone is welcoming, and even if you are a beginner, you will figure it out!  I recommend this studio completely.
