5	When a tenant called me in the middle of the night because the refrigerator stopped refrigerating and was getting warm I got a little panicked, grabbed some coffee and pulled up yelp. I found Emergency Appliance Repair on the top of the list, and saw that they had a good coupon. I called them up from my home and told them the situation. They went out and got the fridge fixed quickly, so quickly in fact that some of the food was saved. They were also very flexible and my tenant got great service even though I was hundreds of miles away. I will be keeping them on a sticky note for the next time something happens!
5	Professional courteous and thorough, highly recommended. Our Whirlpool Dryer stopped getting hot on a Friday. The warranty service couldn't come out till after the weekend. We found Emergency Appliance Repair by searching Online. The technician was on time and promptly repaired the heating problem and recommended a duct cleaning. Unfortunately the dryer began to make a loud squeak after the technician had left. With a phone call the technician was back and fixed the problem free of charge. This commitment to service, in an imperfect world, makes me feel confident about recommending Emergency Appliance Repair.
