1	It's a scandal. I waited my pizza for 45 min after have passed my order on their website for a delivery and still no pizza. So, i phoned the restaurant and they didn't find my order. The restaurant phone me back later to tell me that they found my order which was waiting at restaurant. To sum up, don't order with this restaurant.
4	Why the hell does this place not have more amazing reviews?This place is excellent. By far best delivery pizza I've had in NDG since moving here last Summer. I've tried Pinoli's, Double Pizza, Domino's, and this place is just by far the best and most consistent.Firstly they come fast, and they have great simple clean ingredients. Nothing flash, nothing cheap. Just good ingredients. Pizza's seem homemade. Plus their amazing deals. You can get two medium pizzas for less than one nasty pizza from Dominos.I've also ordered other things, like pasta, which was just OK, not great, not bad either. And buffalo wings, which were the same. All enjoyed, but nothing special.The pizza however, very consistent and really good. Order that and you'll be happy, no doubt.I've never been there, but delivery is great.
1	I tried this place after reading Hello I's review right below and my experience with this pizza place was so bad I have to wonder if the aforementioned review was a shill review. We ordered 2 small pepperoni and bacon with a large poutine. The pizza was soggy, the bacon bits were rubber, and the pepperoni scarce. The poutine was cold and gravy and cheese were lacking. With so many option in the area how they stay afloat is a mystery to me.
