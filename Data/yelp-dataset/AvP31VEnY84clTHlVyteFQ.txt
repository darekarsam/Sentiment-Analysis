5	Great Job!They customized our stairs and redid flooring.Couldn't be happierGood to work with
5	Can't say enough about how wonderful the crew at Castillo was. We recently converted a large upstairs bedroom into a loft and had a light added to the room below. We received quotes from 5 companies in total, some were less expensive and some were way, way more. Overall, we paid a very fair price for some amazing craftsmanship. We will absolutely be using Castillo again in the near future for kitchen and bathroom remodels. I would highly recommend these guys.
5	We are very pleased with the job, we had 2 bathrooms done, next project master bathroom and I highly recommend them.
