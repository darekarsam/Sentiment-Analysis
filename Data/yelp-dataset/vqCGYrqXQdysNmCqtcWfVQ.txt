3	This store is fun, but a hit and miss for me sometimes.The quality is suspect on some items (I bought a sweater there and it pilled on its FIRST wash), and since some of the pieces are done in Montreal, they're not really checked for wearability (another sweater had sleeves so short they should have been 3/4 sleeves instead of this weird in between thing).The prices are okay. I wouldn't say affordable, but you can probably find something special here once in a while.
