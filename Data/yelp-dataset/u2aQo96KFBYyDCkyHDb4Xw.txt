4	Nice 80's and 90's music. Many pool tables and fussball. Overall a nice place but surprisingly empty on some nights.
3	It's been a while since I've been there, but I just did a review from the store beside so why not post something about this place!?It's a nice size place. The crowd is not the youngest but around 25-35 area. So there's lot of old school music and all the new stuff is the usual that plays everywhere else. The tables are great, the queue and the balls that well maintained and I saw Denis Martel play or tech somebody else. Who is that dude? He's in top 10 in Canada and has an incredible control of the queue ball, quite impressive. This place kind of reminds me of The Skratch but with a more friendly and less slutty staff (Not that i'm dissing slutty staff! they're part of the experience!)
3	Unexpected spot! Climb 3 flights of institutionally-flavoured stairs to find it, and once you're there the feeling of floating above and outside rue St Catherine makes for a nice escape. 6$ for a nice big scotch and soda and a smile. The wait staff in general were charming, funny, helpful, no stress. The pool tables looked like they were in good shape, with enough space between them to feel relaxed and comfortable. Several extra large booths line the wall, and a few partially closed Asian-inspired seating areas line the back for more intimate dining. I didn't try the food but the white brick walls, cozy couches, strong drinks and nice staff make me inclined to give a great review. But the music was a little odd - the DJ basically found a single beat s/he liked and stuck it under every single song to the point where everyone in my group noticed and thought it a weird choice.
