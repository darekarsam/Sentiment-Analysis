5	Very nice staff. The manager was in when I was there and he personally said hello to every single person eating here.
3	Service is consistent. Team is fast and courteous. Food is generally fresh. I am always disappointed with subway in general because of thier cheap portions.  But hey I get it.  This is by far one of the better subways in the valley.
