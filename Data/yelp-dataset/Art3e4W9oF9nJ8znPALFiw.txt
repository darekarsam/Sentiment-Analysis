5	We were recommened to this restaurant by one of clients from NYC.  We were not thinking eating Russian in Montreal but we did because she insisted that it is as good as it gets.  First it is not in the tourist area but by driving it took us 10 mins from our hotel in downtown.  We meet one of the owners Gala, she mends the front and her husband is the chef.  She was great and we ordered the gastronome menu because it has everything we can taste.  She suggested that we share because of its portion.  It was great because it was just perfect.  Everything was so refine and tasty and we live in Brooklyn and we never even been to a reputable Russian restaurant that does not involve a cabaret.  So it was so great to eat and enjoy the food.  We loved it so much that we went back 2 days later!  It has to be the best meals we had in Montreal and the price is right!  We went to Toque, Au Pied de Cochon, L'Express and many others but this is by far the best.  Please make your way to this lovely neighborhood restaurant that's great price and great food.

5	we had our pre-weddng celebration dinner here.. we had about 50 people.. entertainment was good... food was even better.. its in NDG - so not really touristy. but accessible by metro or taxi ride from downtown (should be about $15 depending from where)its russian food.. so be prepared to eat a lot ;)
5	Improv evening with my boyfriend, could not have had a nicer surprise! The fresh, impeccable food paired with a chilled ambiance made this candlelit dinner sheer perfection. Would recommend to anyone with taste buds
