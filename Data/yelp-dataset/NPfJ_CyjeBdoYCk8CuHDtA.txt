4	Clean and bright, and within walking distance (1.5 miles one-way).  I like that I can find whole wheat pita pockets here, as well as the occasional bunch of organic bananas.  I also found Horizon-brand organic egg nog in the milk/egg section!  (Not as good as Clover-brand, but it'll do in a pinch.) Even though there weren't many customers in the grocery store at the time of my last visit, it was nice to see more than two register lanes were open (I thought I saw three w/ lights on),  as well as six self-scanning stations available.  One of these days I'm going to have to check out sushi at neighbor Tanaka...
5	I just love going to Bi-Lo. They have a lot of Buy 1, Get 1 deals every week for a lot of major name brand items, which also have coupons to match. In addition, you get Fuel Perks for all money spent, plus bonus fuel perks. One thing most people don't know is that you get money towards fuel perks for gift card purchases. Their Gift Card shelving includes almost every gift card except Target or Wal-Mart. So you can get those birthday and anniversary gift cards and get fuel perks back. The fuel perks work at Shell Gas Stations and there's a comparable priced one that is right across the street. The store overall seems a little older than some I've seen, but it's always clean. In addition, the customer service reps are always very friendly. You usually don't have a long wait. They always have a register open. Overall, my grocery store of choice.
4	Wish there was one closer to my house. They have good prices here the staff is polite courteous and professional and I always come here for my gas points to put on my bi lo card at participating  Shell gas stations....
1	You can't get in touch with anyone in corporate? Then you know something is up
4	Love the furl rewards & never a long wait.  Everyone is always friendly too.  Easy parking
2	I would much rather use the Harris Teeter right down the road. Employees aren't very friendly or helpful.
