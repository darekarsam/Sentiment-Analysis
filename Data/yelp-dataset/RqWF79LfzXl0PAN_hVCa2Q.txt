3	I have been driving by this little bakery for several years now and always wanting to stop in and try it.  Unfortunately, they are usually closed when I have the time to stop.  I was finally lucky enough to find them open at a time when I had a chance to stop and pop in.  The cases were less than half full and I found this a tad disconcerting and so asked the lady behind the counter why they were so empty.  She said they they normally sell out of most of their fare very early in the day.  Luckily, they did have a small yellow cake with butter cream frosting.  I ordered one and took it home.The cake was good, but it wasn't as good as some of the other bakeries in the Pittsburgh Metro.  I would never crave it, but I would return if the other bakeries were closed at the time.
