4	This rather large charity shop has a great selection of stuff. Like a lot of charity shops in this area it benefits from the relatively wealthy locals and therefore has a good stock of quality furniture, kitchen appliances, books etc. It primarily has furniture, kitchen equipment and bric-a-brac (including cute tea pots!). Well worth a shot if you are just browsing for something cheap.
5	This place is right next to my flat. Good and bad. Good for the thrift store addict in me. Bad for the thrift store addict in me. They sometimes have a smaller selection than other stores but they always have some good stuff. The staff here are always so sweet and helpful and if there's not a price on something they just ask me what I want to pay for it! They also have some amazing furniture for super prices...unfortunately I live in a furnished flat that would bust at the seams if I took any furniture it but, a girl can dream, can't she?
