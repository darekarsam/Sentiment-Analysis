5	Awesome Portuguese bakery.Here you will find the origin of Chinese, Dan Tat, in the original Portuguese Po Tat. It's more caramel-ly and less eggy than the Chinese counterpart, with a crispier crust.Do give it a try when you're here.
5	In my opinion, this is the best Portuguese bakery in Montreal. Perfectly located near Romados, you cannot go wrong with anything you get here as all the pastries are always fresh. The natas have a crunchy flaky crust and a not too sweet creamy custard. Not quite the selection of what you would find in Lisbon, Portugal but this is absolute heaven for your sweet tooth! Obrigado!
4	Best Natas in Montreal. One oft favorite bakery's in Montreal. If you want real Portuguese bakery items, this is it.  The only thing is not much selection of bakery items.What they do have is all good!
3	Sorry, but egg tarts served COLD is just not my thing.
4	Don't be fooled by appearances. Behind a not particularly enticing storefront is a bakery FILLED with natas. That is the most natas I have ever seen in one place. Not only do they have the standard egg custard natas, they have variations like chocolate, maple and apple pie. Yum! The price is right too, much cheaper than buying from a Portuguese chicken place or a grocery store, as I usually do.  I will definitely be back!
