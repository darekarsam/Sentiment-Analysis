5	Wow!  I ate here while staying at the InterContinental Hotel, and I was thrilled!  For dinner, I had the calamari as the appetizer, which was one of the best I've ever had.  The ribsteak was also amazing.  My wife ate the salmon tartar, which was also amazing.The next morning, we ate at the breakfast buffet, which had a great selection of cereals, breads, and omelettes.  In particular, the crepes with maple syrup was simply out of this world.I can't speak highly enough about this restaurant.  Try it!
3	Absolutely average food. Went for taste of Montreal. The restaurant could have tried a little harder to bring diners back. Too many other much better restaurants in Montreal
2	Provincial fish soup for taste of mtl was so bad. Like awful. No, it was really bad. I don't think you get how bad it was.Deserts were the best part of the 3 course meal. Scallops were sandy :(Would not recommend.
