5	Currently I am having 2 almost 8' planters made for the entryway of my first home. As a first time homebuyer it's very important to me to work alongside every home improvement. Rob and his company have already included me every step of the way, giving daily updates and even including photos I can share with my family regarding this project! What a fantastic experience it has already been! I will include them in my remodel scrap book of our home and it has already become part of making it our own! I was able to pay though pay pal, and pick up LOCALLY! Also they are getting done very quickly!!!
5	Rob has done more than 6 framing projects for me.  I am very happy with all of them.  The process was very easy, just bring Rob the picture(s) and he will get it done for you.  I will continue to use Frames by Frythawfur's services until I run out of wall space.
5	A shout out of "THANKS" to Rob for such an awesome "flag" framing job!  Every inch of the 3x5' masterpiece so very suitable for our Ole' Betsy American Heirloom! Your work is the "best"  you are a superb Artist!!!  Can't hardly wait to figure out what next...
