5	This is the second time I go to La Recolte and surely won't be my last. The food is always amazing. Fresh flavors, exquisite taste and 5 star service. I can not wait to return to this place.
5	Came here yesterday. We were all blown away by the quality, creativity, and execution. Food tasted really fantastic and portion sizes were perfect. We all ordered different dishes from the very limited but well-crafted menu. Service was a bit slow but being that the servers also worked in the kitchen, it was easy to forgive. Was pretty empty which was surprising, perhaps still undiscovered. Highly recommended little nook.
4	Great local food.Creative, taste and well made.Very welcoming and smiling personnel.
