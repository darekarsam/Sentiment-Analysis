5	The guys that work in here made me want to be a happier person. And the Julia Gulia (ca classier healthier version of a crunch wrap supreme) just changed my life. Best 4th meal stop ever!!!
2	Not much taste in their food. Steak tasted like in was soaking in water, queso dip tasted like paper. Had the steak quesadilla, tortilla had the most flavor of anything.
4	I've been to a few Moe's around town and this is my favorite.  The line moves quickly and the food is good.  They have a check in where you enter your phone number 10 times and get a free meal.  Added bonus.  I asked other Moe's about this and they laughed.  It's a nice perk.
1	Rice was undercooked, steak not seasoned, coca cola disgusting. Overall the food was all bad which is sad bc we've been to Moe's in some other states before and it was way better!!
2	The Moe's at the EpiCentre is not as good as other Moe's Southwestern Grill locations in the Charlotte area.  For starters, the prices are higher at this location.  The burritos and tacos are also not as good; with the pinto beans overly flavored and other items somewhat lacking.  Another annoyance is the two Freestyle Coke machines that seem to always be out of some flavors.  Overall, I give this location two stars... it can be better, just that they weren't any of the times I visited.
4	Well moes, what can i say. My friend and i start to go there during my freshman year and keep going. Why? Because they have really good nachos and burritos. The portions are big and sometimes i just get a moes mood and just head there for some good nachos.
