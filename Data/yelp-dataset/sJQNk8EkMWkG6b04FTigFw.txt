1	Terrible service, but i suppose you cannot expect much from the hired 17year old girls. Walked in and went to the register to ask a question. The 3 girls stood there chatting with each other for a good amount of time, while I stood waiting and trying to make eye contact. I finally just interrupted the in-depth conversation about failing their driving tests. My question was sincere and it was answered with a terrible attitude. I did not end up doing business here... After all, wouldn't want to bother the staff with the task of doing their job.
4	My 4 year old daughter insisted that she neeeeeded her ears pierced to go on living another day, so off to Claire's we went. I am a "for real adult" and can't recall the last time I had cause to go into Claire's though I am certain it was back when neon and leg warmers were the shiz. (The first time). The two girls working were standing at the door gabbing with a boy from another store so I was put off at first. Once I flagged one down, it went better. She offered the option of waiting 20 min so my daughter could get both ears done at once instead of one at a time, but my girl wasn't having that. I was at first leery about letting a girl most likely in High school puncture my sweet girl's ears, but I was pleasantly surprised. The employee who did her piercing was friendly and thorough. I was pleased with her professionalism and my daughter is beyond thrilled with her fancy new ears. I would recommend Claire's for ear piercing.
