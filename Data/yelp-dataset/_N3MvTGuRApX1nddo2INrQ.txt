4	This pasta place is very, very good and it has been around for a long time. It is in Marche De L'Ouest. The food is always very tasty. I normally have a meat ball and a  sausage with my pasta. You get to choose your sauce, just pick any one, they are all very tasty. You eat this in the food court area and that is why I give it four stars, but the food is 5 stars. Consistent good Italian food in the West Island.
4	I agree with the others. Consistently good-tasting food at a reasonable price. I did find something hard in my ravioli the first time I went. Unpleasant. Went back though, and today the lasagna was very good.
4	Really get a bang for your buck here. The pasta never fails to disappoint i usually order the seafood linguine and it has always been delicious. They usually get it to you in five minutes and you can see them making the whole meal which is an added bonus. They fill the containers or plates until they are about to overflow and they give you a bread roll. All this for under $10 tax in. The staff have always been friendly and always accommodate anything you may want to change such as a different type of pasta. Food has always been piping hot and plentiful. I always pick this place when i want take out pasta beats any other place in the west island that charges 3 times the price for overcooked pasta with generic red or white sauces.
