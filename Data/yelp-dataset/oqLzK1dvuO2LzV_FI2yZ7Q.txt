5	E&N Auto and Accessories has everything on your wish list when looking for a mechanic.  These guys are experts and will be thorough in evaluating, diagnosing and explaining any issues they find.  Unlike many other mechanics, they make excellent recommendations on prioritizing what to fix so that it fits your budget - it's about fixing your problems, not up selling.  They educate you on your vehicle and explain why problems occur.  They are honest, trustworthy, reliable and at pricing that typically saves me 50% compared to taking my car to the dealer, they save you money - all of this combined equals tremendous value!  They can even arrange to pick up your vehicle for you and provide a loaner so you don't have to miss work or rent a car.  How much more convenience can you ask for?  This is five-star service!  Take your vehicle there - you won't be disappointed.
5	I'm still pretty new to AZ so I wasn't sure where to take my car when it needed work done. My cousin suggested I go to E&N so I did and I'm glad I did. The owner (Edwin) was able to answer all my questions. (and I had a lot) They did a great job at a reasonable price. I'll be back real soon.
