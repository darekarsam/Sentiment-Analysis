2	This is good when you are on the road and stopping for fuel.  If there was any other fast food restaurant around I would choose them hands down over subway.
3	chicken is tasteless but good enough to fill an empty stomach
4	Prompt and friendly service.  Food was no different from any other Subway I've visited.  Our only problem was that the AC was cranked so much that it was COLD inside the restaurant.
2	This Subway is conveniently located just off the freeway by a shell station in an area that doesn't have many options. I got a salad, which tasted OK, but I wished I had stopped her from chopping it to death...the spinach was bruised and the whole thing mushy...it would have had better texture if it had been left alone. For $7.99 it was a very mediocre salad. Cookies were good.
2	My wife and I had this Subway location randomly after stopping for gas.  I wasn't a fan at all with it, but we had a gift card to use.  Their prices appeared to be $1 or $2 raised as the 6 " subs were around $5.  We decided to try something different and get the chicken chopped salad.  Not a good idea by us as it was CHOPPED to shreds.  Why does a salad need to be in tiny bites?  I have no idea, but it wasn't very good.  You could taste the flavors but the spinach obviously loses some of the natural crunch.  I would avoid this Subway if you can help it or at least just get a sandwich not a extremely chopped salad.
