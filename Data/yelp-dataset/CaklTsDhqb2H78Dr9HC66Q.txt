4	Great Vietnamese grocery store. I go here to buy squid, quail, chinese donuts, nem, etc. Very reasonably priced and great variety of Vietnamese products. If you live in the area and need fish sauce/hot sauce/vermicelli or anything Chinese/Vietnamese cuisine related, this is the place for you.  Expect to spend $20/less on several food items.  There's also a sweets section!
4	Definitely one of the best shopping options in the area! All kinds of hard to find Asian fruit and veg still fresh and healthy looking, rows and rows of sauces and not overpriced! (most recently: a big bottle of the thick sweet soy sauce, ie; the good on everything sauce. Like $3.) There's also a quick helpful butcher in the back with again, fresh product, very fair prices, and up front near the cash you can get delicious bean curd sesame balls, Chinese donuts, spicy bahn mi, or a basket of take-away chicken feet. They have the fresh rice noodles in the fridge, and all kinds of other tasty goodness I've still yet to discover!
3	I came here by chance and holy hannah am I happy I've found an Asian supermarket not far from Marche Jean Talon.  Reason being I'm frequently at MJT and there are times in which I feel like some char siu, sesame balls, dumplings or that asian ingredient to compliment my dish and I won't have to go all the way to Marche Hawaii or Chinatown.  Prices here are your typical asian market.  I appreciate that they don't try to hose their own people with expensive overpricing.They have a butcher and meat and fresh seafood section in the back and also quite odd, but not unusual their own jewellery shop as a stand alone enclosed kiosk in the store.  It was closed on the day I was there.  Picked up some of my regular chicken cabbage dumplings but I shall be back to try some of their other goods and items.
