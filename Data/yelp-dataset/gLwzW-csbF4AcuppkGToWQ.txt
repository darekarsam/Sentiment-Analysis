3	I came here for a haircut because I was near here and needed a haircut.  I just get a standard men's regular scissor cut, so most places are basically the same.  I just walked in and there was no wait for one of the stylists, so I got my hair cut quickly and efficiently and everything was pleasant and pretty much what I expected.  The haircut was a better than average, and she clearly cared about doing it correctly, so that's nice.  But at $20 for a men's regular and no rinsing or product or anything it's a bit pricier (25% more) than other places in the area that produce similar results, but  it's still not a bad deal for a decent haircut.
5	I moved from CA recently and needed to find a good barber. I came here on a whim and as far as I'm concerned, Michael is the best barber in NC. If you're a dude, do yourself a favor and check this location out!
3	Fast cut and only $13Is it was it is.  I'm pretty bald these days, so I don't really care too much.  They write down the way you got it cut before, so if you don't like make sure they know.  Its a chain, so they can be found where ever/whenever.
