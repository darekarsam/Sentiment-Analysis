3	Sherwin Williams paint is great! We tried a regular home maintenance paint, but found out that Sherwin Williams paint is worth the price you pay. I've been here multiple times and there has always been one guy working the counter...which makes for a really long wait. They aren't very good at answering their phone too so don't bother calling because if its just that one guy working then he doesn't have time to answer. They have everything you need here to paint and their paint selection/colors is extensive. You can always choose to go with their low VOC paint, but I really couldn't tell the difference between the smells from when we painted one room with their low VOC to their regular paint. They also offer discounts from time to time, so I would check online or wait for their 30% off all paints and supplies!
4	We visited this location after being told about their design consultants. The place was actually very clean. Wouldn't have figured a paint store would have been so well kept. We are building a new house and had a hard time finalizing some of the colors. The design consultant was very helpful in helping us find solutions that met the style we are going for. Was very friendly even though the place was a bit busy.
