4	It's a Starbucks - very exciting...anyway I'm always glad they're there - I happen to be the guy who likes burnt, strong coffee - seriously. Being from NY and a whole or skim milk user - it is pretty funny that the NC health code rules force them to only put half and half out at the counter.
3	Starbucks has become quite the institution here in the good ole' USA. As most folks do, I enjoy their coffee. Generally I'm a Venti Mocha, no whip kind of girl but on occasion I will branch out and try a Columbian Roast or a Frappaccino.The breakfast sandwiches are not the best, but better tasting than McDonald's in my opinion. The bakery items are fine for prepackaged stuff. I don't usually go in as it's always crowded, there is a long line (even in the drive thru - plan a few extra minutes for waiting) and for some reason it's always cold. All in all I prefer home grown coffee shops or small hole in the wall places but this is, just as it is called, a Starbucks, and nothing more.
2	Dirty, if your not busy clean your Damn store. Your Starbucks for crying out loud.  This is a small mall style chain inside a very clean, bright mall.  I've been to a Mill's mall before in California and stores like this are what start the slow decline of what could be a great place to go.  Starbucks... CLEAN UP YOUR ACT!
1	Watch them at the drive-thru window!I paid for an iced latte and just happened to be watching as they poured regular coffee out of a carafe and dumped some milk in it. They finally made a new one after much drama. I wonder how often this occurs and I just happen to notice.
2	Perfect location but the baristas are always more concerned with conversations amongst themselves than getting the orders out in a timely fashion. I always wait a minimum of 10 minutes - despite the traffic in the store. and good gracious, bless your soul if it's busy. on the weekends, forget stopping here for coffee. It will take you 25 minutes to get through the drive through.
