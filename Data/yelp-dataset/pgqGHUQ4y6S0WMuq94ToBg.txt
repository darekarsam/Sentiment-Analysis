4	This Starbucks is located inside of Albertsons. I'm not here very often because I don't like shopping at Albertsons. But, it is the one that is closest to my house.Usually, there are two or three people in line ahead of us when we come, but the staff does their best to try and balance it so they can accommodate everyone.Drinks have been delicious, and consistent at this location. So, I'm a fan.
5	Me and my wife get our coffee here every morning and the staff is awesome and remember our names and drinks and have never gotten it wrong and are verry polite! Barb is the mgr and she runs a great coffee shop!     As for the evening crew they can definitely use some retraining for sure! Nite and day difference between day and evening crew
1	Seriously the worst Starbucks ever. Not only are they "not" aloud to take/scan a Starbucks card off of a phone, but they didn't know anything about the drinks they're making. Stating that "we can't make Christmas drinks in a tall size." When every other Starbucks does. It's disappointing to see such a great company have such a terrible store.
