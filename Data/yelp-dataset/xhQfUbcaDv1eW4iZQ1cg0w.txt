5	I love Nostalgia Resources!  They have quality vintage pieces at a right rental price for your budget!Veronica and her husband are wonderful to work with.  They are very nice, friendly, accomodating, talented and has a great taste! They have so many interesting and mind blowing vintage collections. I rented their gorgeous settee (Dolores) and vintage suitcases for my wedding!  We used it for our ceremony and moved it to the reception.  All our guests had fun having pictures on this settee!  It was really beautiful.  I sincerely recommend them for vintage rentals!

5	Veronica and her husband were so easy to work with! I would definitely recommend renting from them. We were in town for a trade show and they made everything so simple and seamless for us! They delivered and picked up everything and the rentals were perfect! Looking forward to working with them again in the future.
