1	i got senegalese twist for my wedding and within two weeks about 10 braids literally fell out from the root of my hair!!!! i am in the process of sueing them as of today because of their unprofessionalism and insistence of blaming the hair lost on me possibly putting the hair in a ponytail. even if i did put my hair in a pony tail, there should be no reason why my hair is falling out from the root. like where do you go to get your hair done and they say if you put your hair in a pony tail it could fall out???? this is ridiculous and not a good way to do business especially when i spent $300 including tip to these devils who dont promote hair growth but hair lost. yes the hair looks good, but the quality sucks and i would rather wear an afro than to have beautiful braids falling down like rain drops. I asked for medium small braids and when they get to the top of my head my brads are getting smaller and smaller and that is a recipe for hair loss. OH its on bofia braiding!!!
5	Best braiders ever. The bofia braiding salon have the best stylists in town. They can braid good. Very fast and professional. 2 people braiding most of the time
5	The only place i go to when I need some braids or twist! These girls are talented and fast.
1	If I could give this place zero stars I would! I asked for twist in an A-line bob (short in the back, longer in the front). First, the hair they used looks like yarn. Secondly, my hair is so many different lengths all over & one side is shorter than the other. It looks nothing like I asked, then on top of that I was quoted $200 then told it was $220. I paid $200, only to find out that they charged my account an additional $20 the next day using that square machine. BEWARE!!! I will never return, so disappointing.
