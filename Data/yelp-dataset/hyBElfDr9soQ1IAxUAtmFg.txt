4	Nice space and decor, friendly and patient staff (owners), fantastic selection of sandwiches and salads, light fare, desserts, coffee and teas with very fresh ingredients. Good value for the money compared to even the fast food places nearby considering how fresh and tasty everything is. You can sit in the cosy chairs, read the newspaper, catch up with friends, or just take you food back to the office. Managed to sample many of the sandwiches but the roast beef with horseradish is excellent. Highly recommended place to grab a light meal.
