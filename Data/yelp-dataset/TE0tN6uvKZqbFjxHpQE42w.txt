5	Came here for the dancing. This place is absolutely beautiful and the dancing and the music was phenomenal. Seriously, Montreal is the best for dancing!
1	If I were to try to properly describe this place I would have to completely give up on political correctness. All I can say is stay away! People get shot here. Yes. More than once.
4	I really enjoyed this place. The food was good, very tasty. I had the steak-fries. The cocktails were good, expensive but you get a free drink upon entering. I stuck to rye and ginger for $7 after my free Miami Ice.  The band was awesome and the music was great. I went on a Wednesday Latin music night. Ladies ate for $6. Ladies night. We got here early and left about 12:30am. It was really getting busy.We danced all evening, salsa, merengue, bachata, popular dance music (reggae, house, etc..)
4	I like this place... (a) If you come for food, you won't be disappointed, (b) prices are reasonable, (c) If you come here to dance, it's gorgeous, clean, NOT filled with little barely-legal children, and always has good music. Only pitfall is that it is in Laval, which makes is a little bit out of the way (and makes it necessary to drive to.. hence the lack of children). Otherwise, one of my favorite clubs in the city!
4	Being in my forties I wasn't sure about going to a restaurant / club type of place.  I was wrong.  The food was excellent , a great atmosphere, great music,  and the crowd was in their 30's and 40's...translation no one was looking down at their phones.  However, be warned...at 11 pm the place transforms into a young crowd..really young.  I recommend it if you are planning to leave at that time.
