1	avoid this place at all costs, there are enough other subway resturants to eat at.the last two times i went here the employees were mean and act like they dont want to help anyone. rude.
1	I'm not surprised this subway only has 1 star! The staff is rude, unpleasant and just a bad experience. I will go out of my way next time to a different subway just to avoid this one.
1	Everytime I come to this particular Subway I remember why I avoid this one. Lets start with the food. If you order a kids meal, they use the leftover scraps of bread. Today, it was no longer than an inch and a half. One piece of ham folded over and it hung out the sides. Two pickles and a glob of mayonnaise the size of a dime in the middle. Lets go to their menu. Right now, 6" cold cut or meatball subs are 2.00. They dont have that posted ANYWHERE. they tried to charge me full price and I had to show them my e-mail. With that said, good luck getting much veggies on your sandwich. While they make your sandwich you actually get the feeling you are inconveniencing them. They throw everything in very sloppy. Vinefar and oil they squirt in one spot. Very rude staff. I usually avoid this particular one. When I do come back to it, its always the same. Drive an extra couple miles to a different one.
