2	Don't come to this location if you speak English. NONE of the employees here do. Every time I go I have to repeat my order, then I hear some rustling, and a new person (who also doesn't speak English) asks if they can take my order. I'll have to repeat it to THEM again too. I once got the completely wrong order, tried to give it back to the person at the window, and they shook their head and said they didn't know what I was saying, then closed the window on me.
2	The staff definitely has a problem understanding English.  I had a coupon for "free jalapeno thickburger with the purchase of ANY thickburger".  I tried to order the basic thickburger and get the free jalapeno one, but the young latina girl could not comprehend and tried to charge me for a jalapeno thickburger.  She finally called a female latina supervisor over who had little more grasp of English and said she could give me a senior discount which would make it less than the price of the BOGO jalapeno thickburger they charged me for.  I gave up and settled for that.  It wasn't worth the hassle.  I will say I like their sausage and egg biscuits in the morning, and I've never had a problem getting that order correct.
1	The absolute WORST cheeseburger I've ever been served in my life! See the photo. Zero stars.  Seems like every other hamburger place puts an 800 number or a link to their website so you can comment on the food/service. Not this place. Now I know what they are afraid of hearing/seeing.
