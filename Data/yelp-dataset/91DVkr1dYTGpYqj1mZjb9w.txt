5	I really like this nail salon! I would highly recommend it if you are in the cave creek area! It's clean and they know what they are doing. There is no question if they are licensed because they definitely are. Everyone there has a license and their supplies are all clean. No question about that. At first I was nervous to get my eyebrows done because I am picky but I will be coming back!! I got the hydration pedicure and I am in heaven. My feet are noticeably smoother.
5	TJ and Kim did an amazing job every time I visit I feel like a new woman!!  The Team is amazing!!!
5	BEST SALON IN THE CREEK! The staff is extremely nice. Everything tool they use is clean. If you want any design just show them a picture and they will do a great job. The prices are extremely fair. I would highly recommend this salon.
