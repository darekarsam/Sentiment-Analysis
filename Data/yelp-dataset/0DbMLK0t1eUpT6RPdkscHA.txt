5	I lucked into Scotty via google reviews. . .He was easy to get ahold of and prompt in getting out to our house.  Our pool looks gorgeous, he had very reasonable rates and bonus, he's a super nice guy.
5	Really nice guy, great communication- and very important to me- he does what he says he's going to do!
1	Slow service. Deposit money not returned once contract completed. Cheap products. Would not recommend the service.
