5	Wow- talk about amazing service, i have to say if you have a whirlpool applicance and use the whirlpool.com online schedular to service your oven/washer/dryer, etc... definately choose Dinos' appliance factory service.  Our dual in wall oven - electrical panel went out a few weeks ago and we just finally got around to fixing it.  I used the online referral via whirlpool, and picked the first available.  Dino's was out to my house by 9 am today (from scheduling it online on saturday) and had the part in hand and fixed.  Easy, quick, professional.  I highly recommend Dino's.
1	This company was called by Whirlpool to fix my new fridge. They never fixed my leakage from the fridge and had to come out again. After 2 tries and no results, the 3rd time they finally called a different appliance co. They fixed it right away! So now I not only need my kitchen floor replaced from water damage, also scratches from not rolling out the fridge correctly. Terrible experience!!
5	This is my second time to use Dino's, I had used them earlier for an Electric Range Repair, that time Joey came and did a fantastic job.  This week our Washing Machine quit, I called on Tuesday after Labor day and was told they were swamped, but that a Technician would can the next morning and set up an appointment.  John called and made the appointment and he arrived exactly as promised.  A very polite, friendly young man, he got right at the problem and in less than an hour found the issue and had it repaired in no time.  Once again, I will always call Dino's when I need Appliance Repairs.Walter Young
