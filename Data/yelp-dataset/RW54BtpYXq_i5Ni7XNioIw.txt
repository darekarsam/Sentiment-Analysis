5	These guys drove all the way to our house, took one look at the tile I needed cleaning, and told me how I could do it myself without charging me anything.  They were patient, friendly, and honest.  I highly recommend New Look for tile, grout, and general cleaning.
5	So trustworthy!  These guys really came through for me.  Thanks a ton!!
5	I have used John (owner of New Look Carpet Cleaning) twice and I would give him an A plus, plus, plus!  Our 9 year old carpet and bathroom tile looks new with his cleaning and sealing restoration of the grout.  He did services without extra charge.  He has options to choose from which make it a very reasonable cost to maintain our carpet.  I would highly recommend John as the very best!  He is prompt, efficient, honest, clean and friendly and knows the business!!!!
