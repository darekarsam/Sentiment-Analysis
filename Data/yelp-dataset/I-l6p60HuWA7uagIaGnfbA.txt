5	Christan is A very talented barber. His barbering skills and customer service is the reason I stopped going to my old barber shop. He has VERY flexible hours, I usually get my haircuts at 8pm on weeknights after work.  His availability during these hours are invaluable to me.
5	I drove from Tempe just to get my haircut here because the price was reasonable and the ratings were pretty high. The customer service skills that this place offers is exceptional! As soon as I walked through the door I was greeted by two of the employees. I was quickly assisted with Cody. I hadn't been to this shop before but I'm sure glad I made the trip. The amount of time and precision that was out into my haircut was great. I don't remember the last time I've gotten a fade as neat as this. I also noticed while getting my haircut people were starting to line up. One of the employees had offered water or beer while they waited. Which is pretty cool to me. I'd definitely come back and would recommend anyone who were wondering about the facility.
5	He's Polite and he knows what he is doing! I am definitely going back!  If your looking for a good hair cut you have to go to him!
5	Very professional. I will be returning to fresh cuts. Excellent taper fair price. 5/5 service.
5	I was fortunate to read the 5 stars reviews for Chris. As a result, I called for an appointment today.  As noted in previous reviews, Chris is very professional, friendly, and courteous.  He asked what type cut I wanted when I sat in the chair.  Without fail, he delivered!I am quite pleased with his work.  Chris will definitely be my barber in Phoenix!  You will not be disappointed if you give him a try.  You'll become another satisfied client.
