5	I used to fly to DC to get my hair done every 5 weeks as I could not find anywhere I liked in my new city of Vegas..that is until I met Jennifer at ARCS. She is superb... updated my do... and my color and gives a killer scalp massage to boot. The prices are EXTREMELY reasonable for a salon on this caliber.
5	Super friendly staff! Always a great experience! Rachael is on point. Been coming here for four years. Never disappointed!
5	I am a hairstylist and always wanted to go to ARCS for a haircut.  Robert Cromeans is my idol in this business and I know he runs some of the best salon teams out there.  On my recent trip to Las Vegas I walked in for a haircut.  They where able to take me right away.  That was impressive.  Chantelle gave me a great consultation.  I allowed her to do whatever she wanted as long as i could keep my length.  She didnt touch my length and gave me one of the best most balanced haircuts of my life.    I will go back and see her every time, and i hope to work for this company someday.
5	I have been frequenting Arcs for the last two years and I love love love it!!!! Rachel is the best stylist ever!! No matter what she does to me I always look amazing. If you haven't been there you should go! The shampoo alone is worth the trip:)
5	Brooklyn is the best!  I've been seeing her for 2 years and wouldn't dream of going anywhere else.  My hair always looks its best; stylish, healthy and shiny.  ARCs is exquisite and unique from any other salon I've visited, from the dryers which drop from the ceiling to the full display of colors at the Color Bar.  It is a real treat to be pampered at ARCs.Little Kelly did a fantastic job with my rinse, wash & massage, and I can see her going far.
5	I went here to go get my hair done to look cute for the night and they did a awesome job!! I got my hair done by Chantelle and loved her! I will go back to her every time I am in town. Highly recommend this salon, my friend also got her hair done and hers looked great also. They also give the best scalp massages, would go back just for that.
5	I came to ARCs last year when I was in town for a trade show.  I loved my haircut from Ben and was looking forward to coming back to Vegas for another cut.  When I tried booking today, I was told he was no longer working there.  Does anybody know where he went?   It only states Ben on his old business card so I don't even know his last name.
5	This place was fantastic!!  Came in for a pedicure and got much more than I expected (I guess I've been in AZ too long now)!  Great service and my feet were very happy!  Thanks!!  It may be $50 but with salt scrub, moisturizing mask AND lotion rub down, it was well worth it!  I am definitely coming back and would recommend to my friends.
5	Take it tom a local, this is the best salon in town. It's my happy place. Kate is supremely talented & adorable to boot. If you want extensions, a great cut or color, she's your girl. Ross (who sometimes works in the downstairs salon) is my other fave at ARCS. Very talented with those scissors and master of color. When an alleged "blond master" in town couldn't manage to get my friend's color right it was Ross who got her to the blond she wanted. Best scalp massages/shampoo you'll ever have.  Customer oriented. Great vibe. Great talent. .
5	Let me tell you something...this place is awesome and Jennifer is super fun to work with! I had my hair coloring done and a Brazilian Blowout and I couldn't be happier...*sigh*
5	This was my first haircut and style at ARCS. I called the same morning and booked a cut and style with Chris who was very friendly and talented!I got to the salon at noon, and I was immediately greeted and offered a drink (iced water with lemon and a slice of cucumber- so fresh and yummy!). I changed into a robe and sat down. Chris asked me what I was going for, I told him lots of volume and loose curls and off we went to the lather station. This was my favorite part of the whole experience! Instead of having to lay all the way flat and putting your neck on an uncomfortable, hard, cold, sink edge, you just sit and a HEATED neck brace is placed under your slightly tilted back neck. There was also a foot stool at the bottom for added comfort. This absolutely made my shampoo so much more pleasurable, especially with the warm neck brace. At first when I looked at the prices, I thought it was really pricey, but the neck and scalp massage makes up for it!This salon is located in the Shoppes at Mandalay Place. It is really beautifully and uniquely set (the blow dryers hang from the ceiling!). Chris called my haircut "the money maker" and even showed me some tips on how to style it when I'm at home. At the end, they show you the products they used on your hair and ask you if you're interested in purchasing them, but they never pressure you into a sale. My hair never looked better and I felt great when I walked out. Don't be put off by the prices here, it is definitely worth your money. Super friendly, talented, and helpful staff, amazing set-up and amenities you won't get anywhere else! I can't wait to come back in a few months to get my hair done again at ARCS!
5	Wow....what an awesome experience! I was visiting Vegas for a few days and before I had left home I had received the worst hair disaster of my life.... I was almost embarrassed to go into the ARCS.  My hair had been fried and the cut was horriable.  Now I have beautiful color and the coolest styled cut. Brooklyn was the best......by far the finest salon experience  I've ever had!  If you're in Vegas you gotta go see Brooklyn....she's really the best!
5	Love this place. I'm a local and we are blessed to have some fantastic salons all over town but this one is my hands down favorite. Mainly because of my stylist Chantelle. She is a freaking hair genius. Every cut and color I have ever gotten from her has been spot on. She even goes a step above and beyond asking if I want to be styled out with waves. My hair is naturally fine and stick straight and I've given up on curling it myself because it never holds but Chantelle manages to make it look amazing and it lasts all night long. Everyone else in the salon is super friendly. The woman who works the front desk is very nice and was extremely understanding when I totally slept though one of my appointments and rescheduled me in the blink of an eye without any attitude (which is uncommon for Vegas).  Mark ( I believe is his name) is always friendly and takes the time to say hi to clients that aren't even his. I know some reviews have mentioned that it is pricey for services here but it is money well spent if you leave looking like a million bucks. Ask for Chantelle and you won't regret it. Hair genius, I tell you!!
2	I called up this salon last minute to get my hair done before a convention. Thank the world they could get me in on a Sunday. After running around for the last 2 weeks I needed a weed wacker to be taken to my hair. They sat me with a very young stylist. We discussed what I wanted done and she began foiling my hair. After a wash we began the cut. I showed her a pic of Cary Mulligan. She did a beautiful job on the cut and after paying only $75 for my service i thought she more than deserved a $35 tip. At least 8 other co-workers where in the salon and complimented my hair.The problem arose when I went to meet a friend for dinner after word and i hear "OMG the back of your head!" What what? She dragged me into the bathroom flipped open a mirror to show me the back of my hair, striped like a tabby cat from bleach spots. Obviously a rookie mistake, she had colored my short hair before cutting it not knowing how short I was going to go. But I can't believe ANYONE would have let me walk out of the salon like that. I called the salon and left a msg for someone to call me, they had already left for the day so I had to go to CVS to pick up some at home dye to try to correct the mistake.No one ever called me back and so 2 days later I called back pretty peeved. I asked to speak to a manager and they told me "she had left for the day" (it was 2pm on a Tuesday?) After getting into a brief argument on the phone with the receptionist (who asked me "so what do you want us to do about it?") She booked me for an appointment with a "senior" stylist. I went in on Thursday and another girl fixed my hair for free. It looks fine now.I would just say if your looking for an experience in a professional salon, this isnt it. They didnt offer me any free product, an apology or even a slap on the ass on the way out the door. Although I am happy now with my hair I will probably not come back. This place is just a glorified barbershop.
5	I have been visiting this salon, all the way from Montreal, for the past 3 years and have always walked away with a fabulous cut. However, recently, (June 2011) they changed the concept a little and my regular stylist Mark is only in town to see clients once per month, and today, I missed him by a week.Alas, with the concept change there is a deal in the making. No Groupon required! 25$ gets you a wash, cut and style. Sure, the hairdresser will be fairly new to the salon, but is supervised by a high level hairstylist. I saw Laurie and she spent a good 15 minutes talking with me about what my expectations are and discussing several ideas for which direction to go with my hair. The experience was just as wonderful as it has always been with Mark, with every detail being explained and primed to perfection. In the end, if Mark were in town, I would definitely book with him, even without the 75% savings. However, should he not be around, I would gladly book the 25$ cut again, it is one of the best deals on the strip.
3	PROS: *** GREAT HAIR CUT *** GREAT COLOR *** $50 COLOR *** $25 CUT ***CONS: *** 3 HOUR WAIT FOR APPOINTMENT *** 3 1/2 HOURS FOR CUT & COLOR *** I had been wanting to try WALK-IN for a while, and yesterday was the day. I drove into town, and "walked in"... only to be told there were no openings for 3 hours.  To reserve my spot, I had to leave a credit card on file. If you cancel your appointment 2 hours in advance, your credit card won't be charged.Killing 3 hours in Vegas is easy, so I went ahead with reserving my slot, and went shopping and out to eat. Got back to the salon 15 minutes early, and was seen almost right away. The staff had to contend with an upset client first, but apologized for keeping me waiting. Erika asked how I'd like my hair, and when I said I'd like a more vibrant color, she replied with, "WHAT?!"  More vibrant, color, not my mousey brown. So we went to the color bar, and she showed me a book of hair samples. She matched one swatch to my own, and explained how I could have any shade within that range, from black to orange to purple to red. Stunning colors by Paul Mitchell. I first picked a purple and asked if she thought it would go with my skin tone. She said no, too purple.  So I chose a wine/red, and she added a bit of brown to it.Coloring took a long time. Waiting for the color to take took a long time. I read three magazines, cover to cover. Finally it was time to wash and condition my locks. Erika did a great job with that.Then she combed and dried my hair... which again, took a long time. In all, I was there for 3.5 hours. Once my hair was completely dry, she asked how much I'd like taken off. At first I wanted it cut to my shoulders, but after seeing the GORGEOUS COLOR, I didn't want to cut that much off.Erika trimmed my hair and took out much of the bulk which is what I LOVE about Robert Cromeans!  They give an EXCELLENT cut. Atmosphere of the salon is actually dull. I went there for 3 years when it was ARCS, and ARCS popped with stylish clients and experts!  This salon seems cold (not temperature wise). And there was no toilet paper in the bathroom.
5	Kelcie was great!! I'm a local and have been to Robert Cromeans Salon and was excited to see their new location in Mandalay Place! I called the day off and made an appointment for 12p and was greeted & sat down almost as soon as I walked in.  She introduced me to some new products to get the style I want and she did a fantastic job on my hair and gave me exactly what I wanted!! I'm definitely going back and recommend everyone to check it out at least once!
1	OK, Yelpers!  Please read this warning!!!!I'm 27, so it's safe to say I've had lots of haircuts in my life.  This was, without ANY exaggeration, the worst.  Worst.  It was also in the running for the quickest -- and that's not a good thing here.My stylist was Jody (or Jodi).  She was nice, polite, chipper.....but clueless.  Before asking me ANYTHING about how I wanted my hair done, she started chopping away.  That really didn't bother me, though.  I assumed she knew what she was doing.  I'm used to having my hair washed or at least sprayed down so that it's easier for the stylist to cut.   Not here.Jody cut for a few minutes.....8 to be exact.....and then said she was done.  8. Literally.  I don't have a buzz cut or a military do.  Full head of hair here.I asked if she'd clean up my sideburns and neckline.  She said she'd already done so.  Ummmmm.........Sometimes, I spike my hair in front, which Jody and I discussed for the entire 8 minutes.   I kept asking if she'd make sure the top was cut straight.  Nope, it wasn't.The hair on each side of my head was different lengths -- not on purposes.  The back looked unkept.  Front was uneven.  Sideburns left untouched.  Hair not washed. No spray, gel, or product afterward.8 minutes, folks.  When I paid, I asked the cashier if there were other 'lead' stylists or a manager.  He said only "new talent" was left on site.  Sorry...but my stylist was "no talent." He said that Robert Cromeans had another salon downstairs in the Mandalay with more senior stylists.  He said they'd be open for another hour.  I paid, expressed my disappointment, then walked down to the other salon.  Except....they were closed.Worst haircut ever.  Even after expressing disappointment....nobody apologized.I hope this doesn't come across as too dramatic.  It was literally the worst haircut I've ever had.
5	Once I heard about the Walk In Salon online I was super excited to go on my recent trip to Vegas. The prices can't be beat! So while my husband and his buddies spent 2 hours at The Gun Store I spent 2.5 hours at Robert Cromeans. I had one of the best salon experiences of all time here! Who says you can't get your hair done far away from home base? Truth is, I've always been a salon nomad so I'm not as picky about bouncing between salons/stylists. I was scheduled with Lauren Jeralds and she was fantastic from start to finish. We had a pretty lengthy consultation first and she really listened to what I wanted. I never felt pressured or dumb, like some stylists make you feel right off the bat. Lauren was very knowledgeable and very patient. She also taught me some tips for when I do my hair at home - how to blow dry, curl, and even trim my bangs (though she told me not to do that but said she knew I would anyway, LOL). I ended up getting a cut, partial highlight, and shine treatment. The whole shebang cost about $130. Such a great deal! I would recommend coming here to anyone unless you are very particular about where you get your hair done. Still, the Paul Mitchell line of products is excellent, and the care and 'do you'll receive here is worth every penny.
1	Fyi- Based upon an attempt to schedule an appointment. I was referred to this salon for a Men's cut by the hotel spa. When I arrived today to THEhotel I wanted to get my hair properly trimmed up so that I could look my best over this four day vacation. The phone was answered by a guy named Bobby and I started to inquire about their specific location & mentioned that I wanted a cut & style. He smugly answered my initial questions and made me feel as though I was inconveniencing him. I then asked about hours & asked if I could make a reservation for the next day. Again he was very abrupt with me and he asked me what I wanted done so I replied that as I mentioned before, that I wanted a cut & style or just the essentials. Then Bobby laid into me stating that there are several services and that I needed to be more specific. Huh!? After a little hesitation I asked him to explain the options in his words so that I can choose one. This is when it was obvious to me that he was plainly in need of better people skills. Once he rattled off a short list and then blew off going through anymore while insinuating that there are too many options to list...I calmly told him that his attitude is enough to turn me off & I won't be coming there. I am fussy about where I get my hair done and not afraid to spend to get it but poor front desk help is discouraging. They may provide great service here and sadly I didn't get the chance to enjoy any of it:-(
5	Went back to this salon during my January 2013 visit to Las Vegas; how could I ever pass up the $25 haircuts! It's a dream for me to be able to walk into this place and get awesome service and a great cut, all at a bargain price! I explained my wants and needs, the hairdresser listened to me and gave me some her ideas about what might be my best options. I loved that. I don't know hair, I only know what I would like, and with my hairdresser explaining my options, I can make a better decision.In this case, I am trying to grow out my hair, she carefully took a nice chunk off the back and managed to make my hair look awesome without shortening it. It is easy to style, I can wear it curly or straight and most importantly, it doesn't remotely resemble a mullet.
5	Best.Haircut.of.my.life. I was staying at Mandalay for a convention last September and got a supreme haircut from Seth Willis.  Amazing.I have curly, frizzy awful hair and this man performed magic.  Wonderful layers on a still long style.I loved that cut so much I considered a Vegas trip just for him to do it again.
5	Ok, let me clear something up here. There are TWO Robert Cromean salons in Mandalay Bay. One is called A ROBERT CROMEANS SALON. It is located on the "Beach" level (next to Pearl and Surf Shop). The other is called WALK IN SALON, and is located in the Shoppes at Mandalay Place across from LICK. http://www.robertcromeans.com/las-vegas-hair-salons/The Walk In Salon has fully-trained ARCS stylists that just happen to be "less senior" than those stylists available at the salon. The Walk In Salon, therefore, is less expensive. They also offer a wider range of salon services. See the link above for more info on prices / hours / menu of services / etc.This review is for my experience at the Walk In Salon. Despite the name, they DO take appointments. I showed up for mine and barely waited at all for Maddie, my stylist. I had all-over color done, and I truly love how the color turned out. I'll admit I felt a little lost during the color-mixing process-- I would have liked to see a color swatch, and I was a little scared when my stylist used the words "VIBRANT RED" so many times. As I said, though, I LOVE the results. I just need to TRUST my stylists more :)I loved being treated to cucumber water, and the scalp / neck massage they give during my shampoo was uh-huh-huh-mazing. Full disclosure, I actually got shampooed by a guy who works in the OTHER salon, so maybe I got a top-of-the-line massage or something, but I swear-- I felt like I should have bought him dinner first. Honestly, it was a little hard to look my husband in the eye later that day...All in all, I've paid similar amounts for similar treatments at other salons, but I've NEVER gotten the level of service that I received here. Hey, If you want to REALLY want to splurge, then sure-- visit the ARCS salon on the Beach level. But if you want to still feel nicely pampered, while taking significantly less of a hit to the pocketbook, I can HIGHLY recommend this salon.
3	I had been getting my hair done upstairs at the beach at ARC for about a year. My hair had been badly damaged by and amateur on long thick coarse curly hair. My favorite stylist is Amy and Oscar is very good too. HOWEVER, even after a year, their front desk help is rude, incompetent and out right obnoxious. My information was NEVER saved correctly, HE NEVER SPELLED MY NAME RIGHT, although its on ALL MY MAJOR CREDIT CARDS HE CHARGED. When my regular stylist, Chris, left, they deleted ALL MY information yet again and when I called to make appointments they treated me like I was not important and NEVER RETURNED MY PHONE CALLS! When I called back to cancel the appointments because of this Jim told me in a very nice and curt way, "To have a nice day." Amy acted like she was going to have my back but never even noticed our absence from our regular hair appointments. These weren't small or cheap trips since there were ususally four or more appointments I made at a time for family outtings. Not to mention I NEVER SAW ROBERT CROMEAN ONCE IN A YEAR! SO if you want to spend hundreds of dollars to get treated insignificantly and have fruit flavored water this is your place! Otherwise I would go to the Color Salon by Michael Boychuck, who has down to earth respectful and helpful stylists, receptions AND HE ACTUALLY WORKS IN HIS SALON AND SHOWS UP LIKE A REAL PERSON!
4	I had an appointment at the Walk In Salon to get a fairly drastic cut and to freshen up my highlights (I'm a blonde.) I had a little past shoulder length hair when I went in and had Mattie do a super cute bob with a heavy bang. Mattie has this super cute kind of edgy style that made me feel confident that I would walk out of there with an awesome new hairstyle. Mind you I couldn't really see..but it FELT like Mattie used a totally different technique to highlight my hair (all my past hairstylists always did weaving) and it came out amazing! It's been a long time since I've had such bright and totally not brassy highlights and they look even better in the sun! I would highly recommend this salon and I would highly recommend Mattie as your stylist :D
5	My stylist was Mattie. Best haircut and hightlights ever! I'm planning on going back in 6 to 8 wksfor a touch up and I live in San Diego,  CA.I would highly reccommend this salon, especially Mattie. I really appreciated all the tips and tricks.
5	From the moment I walked into the salon, I loved the vibe, the customer service was spot on, and my stylist Mattie, is AMAZING.I was going for a drastic change from light to red and Mattie did an amazing job. My color was vibrant and well done. My cut was cute and exactly what I asked for. Not only was my experience awesome but the conversation was wonderful. I would highly recommend the entire salon but especially Mattie!
5	So I moved out here a little over a year ago and thankfully I met Christina. I finally came into the salon and was blown away. The salon it self is gorgeous and her shampoo is to die for, I didn't want to pick my head up out of the bowl! I finally found someone who cuts my bangs the exact way I want them. My color came out perfect and held for weeks. Can't wait to go back and just let her play. She's amazing and the prices can't be beat.
1	Be careful, they double book appointments.Made an appointment for 10am and there was only 1 stylist who asked me and another customer to "figure out who goes first". It is awkward to make two strangers fight for something they were both promised. They also threaten to bill your room if you are a no-show, so there's no reason to double book.After the awkward standoff I decided to leave because I didn't want to deal with such a crappy experience and noticed that they are always dead which can't bode well for them long term.Across the strip is a place called Christophe that was much nicer, friendlier, and I ended up going there.
5	I look forward to my appointments with Christina she is so pleasant and she actually listens to what you have in mind for your hair.  I have been going to the Salon for about 6 months and she has helped me achieve just the look and color I wanted.There is an extra bonus while getting your hair washed not only a great smell to there products, you will receive a scalp and neck massage to die for!  5 stars to you Christina you deserve it.
5	Fantastic cut and great service from Crissy Winston and WalkIn salon. Highly Recommended!
5	I'm at the walk in salon and mandalay and just got my hair done. The lovely Rachel did my highlights and they look awesome. I highly recommend her and will definitely be back!
5	In Vegas for a quick visit and was in dire need of a hair cut (it had been 1.5 years!!) Saw the Walkin clinic the last time I was in Vegas but waited until this visit to get my hair done. What a fabulous experience! Mattie Cummins knew exactly what to do with my texture of hair and how to guide me in the right direction of taking better care of it! Plus she even gave me a little lesson on how to curl my hair with a flat iron. She took away the nerves of using a new stylist with such ease! I really felt like she knew what she was doing and I couldn't be happier with my cut. Will definitely keep coming back as I am a frequent visitor to Las Vegas from LA.
5	I love this place. My hair always looks good thanks God to my beautiful hair stylist Kelcie Nielson. Ask for her at the register, she will make your hair again beautiful and alive
5	Kelcie Nielson kills it everytime I'm here. Her cuts are sleek, and give me the professional look I need for my work. Great front of the house staff as well!
5	Update 2 days after initial haircut: Mattie introduced me to a couple of products to help strengthen and thicken my fine, heat-damaged hair which included Paul Mitchell's Super Strong Liquid Treatment and the Tea Tree Lemon Sage Thickening Spray. I've always been weary to use products because my hair tends to be super sensitive to them and gets easily weighed down and oily as a result. But when she put these products on my hair they did no such thing. My hair was soft, silky, and not at all oily looking. So I bought them. 2 days after using them, I think the need to use my flat iron after blow drying has been eliminated! 2 days in a row my hair has come out smooth and silky rather than frizzy, in need of the flat iron. It's amazing!!! I also bought some thermal spray upon her suggestion  to help protect my hair from the flat iron but it looks like I won't have to use it. Amazing what a difference the RIGHT products can make! Thank you again Mattie! You very well may have just secured yourself another out of town regular customer! :-)
5	If you're a blond, you must go to Kelcie! She is amazing with cut/color/style.  Love this salon!
5	I LOVE this salon!! Amy is extraordinary - and it is a great experience from the scalp massage to the fabulous cut. Awesome!!
5	I've been going to Tom for two years now. Will not go anywhere else. Love the service and atmosphere. They are true experts in hair color. Everyone is always so friendly and happy to see you. Come and get your hair done here and you'll walk out feeling like a million bucks.
5	I love Rachel, I have been going to her for years. She does great hair, I love how my hair turns out every time I come here. The salon is great, friendly and quick service!
5	I have been going to this salon for years. Crissy is the girl I go to she always does an amazing job and I always leave happy. Everyone who works here is always so nice and very helpful.
5	Had Mattie today at this studio and she is great! Quite chatsy and very hair savvy allowing you kinda take the lead on your own hair so you get exactly what you want-- great atmosphere in this salon and super friendly/fun atmosphere--  I'll defiantly be going back to this one even if I have to fly all the way back to Vegas from Toronto, Canada
5	I'm a man.  I used to be a regular at sports clips.  As long as my neck isn't hairy and my ears are still there, I am easy to please when it comes to a haircut.  Then I became a client of Mattie's and learned what a hairstyle is, for the first time in my life.  I no longer have a buzz cut, I have an actual style.  I get compliments on my hair all the time.  I finally know why my girlfriend makes such a big deal about having a styled 'do.  Mattie does an awesome job.  She's friendly, professional and easy to talk to.  Don't let her killer style scare you.  I'm a professional and she always makes me look sharp.  The staff is really friendly too.  Emily at the front desk always remembers my name and goes out of her way to say hi.  As a local, I never thought I would be a regular at a hair salon on the strip.  Never say never.  Where else can you get an awesome hairstyle, walk next door for a shave and across the hall for a beer at Ri Ra?!  5 stars!
5	Ask For Christina! I was able to get an appointment at the Walk In Salon same day on a Saturday Afternoon. They are open everyday and makes it worthwhile to visit. She did a great modern mens cut. I booked my next appointment post cut right away.The atmosphere is modern but not too flashy or too uncomfortable. The stations seem to be a little tight if it was all full. The wash station is one of the most comfortable ones I have experienced.This location is easy to get to. I parked at Mandalay Bay self parking.
5	Go see Rachel! She is the go to girl for color!!! AMAAAAZING!!! She does AWESOME scissor work too ;)
2	Had my nails done here for my wedding. Painting was a bit messy but I thought it would clean up when I washes my hands. The girl was really nice and fun but although my nails were shiny, the coat didn't even last the day, the nail varnish was running out, I think it was just thinned out too much! Very expensive for what it was, would recommend doing your own nails, i think i could've done better personally.I wouldn't go there again for my nails.
5	I called the salon desperate to get my bushy, grown-out pixie looking presentable. I was able to get a same-day appointment with Paige. Paige was sweet, funny, and really knew her stuff. She took her time to sit down with me and understand what I was going for and what I was willing to do. She also took the time to explain exactly what it was that she as doing and why. Was very pleased with the outcome and will definitely be coming back!
5	What a great experience!!!!  My stylist, Kelcie , did a great job. She listened to my concerns regarding what I wanted and went beyond my expectations. Definitely worry the visit!!!
5	This was my second time at this salon. Scheduled a level 1 stylist...my appt was On time. My Stylist listened to exactly everything I wanted! Friendly and experienced staff. A wonderful relaxing experience! Would certainly recommend and can't wait to return!!
4	I was thrilled to be able to secure a same-day appointment on a Saturday of all days?!?! My appointment started a little late (was originally set to begin at 4:15 pm), but that didn't matter because the staff greeted me and offered me a cold beverage the moment I walked in! The salon is hip, clean and the staff is both knowledgeable and courteous. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a fabulous blowout next time you're at the Mandalay Bay. Ask for April...she rocks!
5	I'm so in love with this salon! It's conveniently located on the strip in the Mandalay Bay Casino. I've been going to Big Tom for years, and he's amazing, especially with blondes! I highly recommend paying him a visit
5	I love using the Lemon Sage thickening spray. It is light and doesn't make your hair stiff. I also bought the shampoo and am excited to try it out too!
5	Will def come back here again! Trevor is amazing! So professional and made sure my experience was one of the greatest! Best haircut I've had in a long time!!!
5	Amazing friendly service. Haven't had my had professionally done in years! Couldn't be happier to have my hair done here :-)
5	It took me an entire YEAR before I found a place in Las Vegas that actually knew how to cut guy's hair. This place is it - professional, good value for the price - $35 for a men's haircut - excellent stylists...I've been to Lauren, Cody and LJ...the staff KNOWS what they are doing - precision, style, great cut, great shampoo, great eye.  I won't go anywhere else in Vegas!
4	I am a future professional student at the Paul Mitchell School of Denver in Denver, Colorado I came on vacation and decided to tour the walkin salon Paul Mitchell Robert Cromeans. I will say I was greeted with 100% kindness from the receptionist as well the professional stylist. It was a awesome experience to see a paul mitchell focus salon in Las Vegas. I will say the only thing that  would have it any more awesome would be to meet Robert Cromeans himself.
5	From the moment I walked in I felt welcome. My stylist, Stacy S., is very friendly and is very good with people. She attended Paul Mitchell School here in Las Vegas. Stacy is very talented!
4	Cody has cut my daughter's hair twice. He does a great job and he's really good with kids. Paige is an excellent colorist; she did ombre on my short hair, not an easy task. Maddie understands the challenges of working with curly hair. We'll definitely be back!
5	Love this place. Rachel Loria always gives me the greatest color/cut!!! She rocks! It's a Las Vegas stop for me every time!!!
5	Best salon ever!! Everyone was so helpful. And Jodi did an great job on my blowout and style. I would recommend everyone to come see her.
