4	Small but humble grocery store. This is the only grocery store in Montreal where I could find lime leaves to make Tom Yum soup! They have nice agar jelly cups (coffee/chocolate/plain flavor) and a basic selection of Asian food products. Inexpensive but downside is cash only.
3	Pretty much the cheapest grocer in the neighborhood. If you are buying veg here they may be closer to the over-ripe end of the spectrum but still good and definitely a savings compared to the market or the IGA. Great spot for Asian noodles and sauces too, which is much appreciated at all times and especially come soup-making season. Staff don't speak English and the French is heavily accented. And they are always serious and fast paced; they get the job done and move folks through so quickly that though it's always full it never feels crowded and you never really stand in line. Before you know it you are armed with tasty goodness with (for me) illegible labels and back out in the sunshine.
