4	It's not hearsay. This place has genuinely tasty dessert items sans-gluten (gluten-free) or not! This place is tucked away on the outer edge of the city of Montreal. But some of the desserts and cakes we had here were simply heavenly. Small venue. But what we tried were fantastic. Sorry for the stringent 4 stars. While outstanding, nothing could really push this place over the edge to superstar status.
