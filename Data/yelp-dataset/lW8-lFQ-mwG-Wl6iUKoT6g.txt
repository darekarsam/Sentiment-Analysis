5	Let's see, what do I like most about this radio station? hmmmm...I would have to say, the fact that they pay me. But I should also mention that it's the best country station in the (well) country. It also has the best morning show in town: Dave Pratt in the Morning.Check it out, 5am-9am every weekday.
5	I sure like listening to Shappy on "The Dave Pratt in the Morning Show" on KMLE. I hated country but now I'm starting to like some country artists. So thank you KMLE.
4	KMLE Country is one of my fav's to listen to.  They play modern country music, not that "twangy" old school country stuff....not to say that's bad, but I'd rather listen to the newer stuff.Also, they put on some great events with Country Thunder and the 8 Man Jam.  Both of those events rock!Return Factor - 90%
5	I always tune into 107.9! They have a great morning show and most importantly, they play great country music all day long! I especially like that they don't overkill the commercials so you get more music than downtime. I know I can always rely on KMLE for good, solid country music! They also host fun country concerts, promote cool events and do great giveaways so keep an ear on the radio during your drive!
