4	Pretty fun, a nice way to spend the evening around the epicenter. Not amazing - but great for people watching. The live band was decent when I went.
2	Had a pretty good time at this event.  The only thing was it was up top at Suite and it was pretty darn hot!!  The service was good. But the food was ok.  I'm really not a big fan of the Epicenter. That probably has something to do with it.
3	It's hot on the rooftop! Personally, it would be awesome but maybe after the sun goes down and if I didn't have to work the next day. I will say though there are so many places to eat and get your evening after work drink on, while listening to some great live tunes. If you happen to be around and like being uptown, the epicenter is not a bad place. Just not my favorite, but I can be a little stick in the mud too. :)
