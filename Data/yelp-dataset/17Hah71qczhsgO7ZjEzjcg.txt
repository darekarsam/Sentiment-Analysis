1	Lost my health insurance application along with many others according to the health insurance exchange. Very poor customer service and zero accountability. I would stay away even though their prices are low.
1	HealthNet has THE WORST customer service I have ever experienced.... not just with Insurance providers, but overall. I think their "Escalation Department" is a circular waste basket. When a customer service rep tells you that they are going to take personal ownership of your issue because it is so messed up on their part, don't believe them. They apparently couldn't care less. I begged them to take my first premium payment so I could be enrolled.I doubt they will take accountability for their incompetence now that open enrollment is closed. Thanks HealthNet! I'll pass my correspondence records on to ObamaCare.
3	I hope this review will help others experiencing issues with Healthnet (Marketplace).  A week ago I was in a panic because my doctor had been listed on healthnet's website under their Provider Search.  When I called to make an appointment, I was told that I was not covered and no contract has been signed with Healthnet.  I filed a complaint with the AZ Dept of Insurance (Here is a link http://www.azinsurance.gov/consumerassistance.html) letting them know my situation.  I received a call from Healthnet within 3 days and within 6 days my doctor signed a contract with this insurance.  I shouldn't have had to go through all this hassle, but Healthnet did come through and everything is A-ok.  I hope this information helps anyone in a similar situation.  Good luck!
1	I was considering signing with HealthNet for 2015.  They list my provider in the directory for 2014 and 2015.  Guess what....my provider did NOT accept HealthNet in 2014 and is not doing so in 2015.  Is this some type of game playing to make potential members thing their doctor accepts this plan when in fact they do not?????
