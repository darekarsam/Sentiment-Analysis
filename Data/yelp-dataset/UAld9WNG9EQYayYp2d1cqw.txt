5	Luckily my fiance and I live close by to these guys, and we have never had a bad experience. They are the nicest repair shop I have ever experienced, and I have a beater so it is often... I recommend them to everyone, they are the best. :)
1	No matter what time you schedule your appointment, they are always behind. My left wheel bearing went bad while I was on vacation in Myrtle Beach. I had it replaced by Goodyear before we drove back to PA. When we got home the sound came back. I called Goodyear and they said it was covered under warranty and I could take it to Ryan's. I took it there and they said the wheel bearing wasn't bad. I knew it was though from the same sound and feel when driving. They refused to fix it. I took it to the Goodyear in Robinson and they found out the mechanic in Myrtle never changed the bearing they only greased it. They replaced the entire thing under warranty. They said it was obvious the wheel bearing was bad and couldn't see why Ryan's lied? Don't trust Ryan's Auto.
5	I work in the area and started going to Ryan Auto several years ago because of the convenience. They are wonderful! I get all of my oil changes here, my inspection, and anything else my car needs. I usually drop it off in the morning on my way to work, and it's always done by the end of the day. They make suggestions to me when they think something needs repaired, but aren't pushy, and are always trustworthy. I never feel ripped off or taken advantage of, as I have at other places. I've always had a great experience at Ryan's and would definitely recommend them. Many of my coworkers take their cars there as well, and I've never heard of a bad experience.
