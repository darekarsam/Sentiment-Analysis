1	Reasonably-priced bring-your-own-wine restaurant, but everything is mediocre at best in there. And it's by no means fine French cuisine. The gizzard salad (salade de gesiers) was actually a bacon salad (salade de lardons) -- this kind of outright lie is unacceptable -- the sauces were bland, the fish overcooked, the service amateurish... I was not expecting fine-dining at this price, but at least something honest and simple. I would definitely not recommend this place.
1	Does not worth the price, I ordered a raviolis  entree and they were undercooked with hard edges, the porc filet mignon was ok (nothing remarkable)Some friends ordered a tomato starter and  was awful, fully stuffed with pure mayonaisse, they didn't even finished it.The service was ok until we asked for the bills.We were a group of 20 and they decided to charge the 10% service before taxes in our bills.
4	I've been here twice, each time with a group, and byo (I don't think there was a charge for wine). I went last week for the second time, and had the prix fixe menu. They started us with a complimentary tomato soup, and plenty of fresh bread. My starter was very simple but tasty, pencil asparagus wrapped in salmon, with a dollop of citrus mousse on the side. My entree was red snapper, which was cooked perfectly with a tasty sauce, and accompanied by mashed potato stuffed tomato and some veggies. The dessert was a berry panna cotta, with a curious yellow berry on top that kind of looked like a tomatillo. I enjoyed the meal, and I would recommend the place to others. Although the menu is in French, the waiters spoke enough english to explain the items that we weren't sure of.
