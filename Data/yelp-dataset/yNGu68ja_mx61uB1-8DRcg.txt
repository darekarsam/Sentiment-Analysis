4	nice clean location
4	For the most part, branches are generally the same that I wouldn't really bother with a review, but this one has a special feature. Ever lose your bank card? It sucks having to wait for a new one in the mail for a week. Sometimes too, you have a serious need for it.  I needed a card fast since I'm going on vacation and my wallet was stolen. This branch can make debit card replacements on the spot! Go sit in the blue seats and wait to see a banker, not line up to the teller. They verify your information and get ID then ask a series of security questions, then go to the back to press your card. I was out of there within 10 minutes! This is a new feature Chase is doing at select branches so I would call to see if there are others in the city, but this is the only one I know of. Close to my house and can save me from card frustrations - this branch is a lifesend.
