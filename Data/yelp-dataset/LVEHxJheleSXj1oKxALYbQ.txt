5	Whether it's an emergency or not, these guys make your problem a priority.  I called City Locksmith first, who said they would call me back in 5 minutes when they sent a technician.  I waited 30; called Ace Lock and someone was here in 10 minutes, just as City Locksmith was calling me to tell me they were finally going to send someone.  CALL ACE FIRST!!!!  :-D
5	These guys are great. Fast, accurate, and very fair. I wouldn't go anywhere else.
5	I already had a transponder key for my truck but needed the key cut so I could use it. They did it right then and didn't charge me anything.
5	Extremely satisfied with the service that was provided by Ace Lock.  Their technician showed up on time, and got to work right away.  It is refreshing to see a craftsman who is proud of his work, and wants to get the job done quickly.
5	Exceeded expectations.  I needed some help with four lock sets, at 10 AM I called Ace (based on Yelp! reviews) and a very pleasant woman told they'd be there the same afternoon.  Sounded good.What was even better?  They showed up less than an hour later!  Since when do service technicians show up several hours early?  Mike took care of the job quickly, efficiently and at a very reasonable price.
5	Great guys there. Brought in a broken lock that it turned out they couldn't do much with but they spent well over an hour helping me and providing guidance on a replacement which they didn't even have to sell me (not lack of inventory, just different category - was more of a Home Depot product) Extremely professional, personable, and helpful staff. Will always come back with any locksmithing needs!
