5	Excellent work and very reasonable pricing!Mr. Flames is located in an older part of North Las Vegas but they had several luxury vehicles in storage and everything seemed very secure. I needed body work and painting done to one of my extra vehicles and the guys over at Mr. Flames really did a nice job. Their paint match was perfect and the price to completely repair and repaint a front bumper, back bumper, side quarter panel and the top of the trunk was only $1000. That was a full $450 less than the cheapest quotes I received from other bodyshops! Obviously I had this cosmetic work done on that car outside of my auto insurance but Mr. Flames also does collision repairs, working with your insurance company.The owner Ed is super nice and very accomodating. I will definitely be sending him more cosmetic auto body business.
5	Mr. Flames helped so much! The auto insurance wanted to total my car because they said it would cost way more to repair it then it was worth. Mr. Flames worked with me to make payments over time and gave me the best rate possible because it was coming out of my pocket. They did a awesome job fixing my car. What a Great Guy Mr. Ed is!! This is a A+++ Company with a Big Heart! Thank You Mr. Ed!! You're the Best!!
