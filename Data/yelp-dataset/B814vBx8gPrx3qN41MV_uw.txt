3	This little take-away does mainly Chinese, with some Thai and a smattering of other cuisines thrown in. The items we ordered varied in tastiness, but the overall result was a good meal. I feel like I'm going to make it a goal to suss out the best items on their extensive menu.Already on the favorite list: the vegetarian aromatic crispy duck was a lot of fun, with little pancakes, sauce, and fresh vegetables to assemble together and eat. The Thai coconut soup and spring rolls were a bit of a disappointment. The pad Thai was ok, but somehow not quite right.
