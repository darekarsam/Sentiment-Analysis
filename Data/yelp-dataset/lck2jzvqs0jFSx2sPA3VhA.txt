4	Great service. Bought a catalytic converter, installed and everything on the lot. Even though most employees that work for auto zone are inexperienced, this is certainly one of the better stores in the valley.
4	Service was good. I needed a new battery and they were all over it. Tested my alternator made sure that was ok, also replaced my battery for me. Over all good service. I'll will continue to go to autozone.
1	I ordered and paid for a simple part online figuring it should be waiting for me when I stopped in to pick it up.  When I got there, one of the associates asked if he could help me.  I explained I had ordered and paid online for a part.  He asked for my last name, went in back (presumably to a computer) looked for about three minutes and came back out and asked for my name again.  He again went back to look, came back out after a couple of minutes and asked exactly what I had ordered then tells me he doesn't think he has that part.. I  asked if he needed the order number from my electronic receipt.  He said no and wandered into the store toward where he thought the part might be. My son,who was walking with him picked it right off of rack. The associate then exclaimed that he again didn't think he had it but there it was! I could've just gone in and found it myself in a couple of minutes and been gone and home in the time this transaction took.   So much for  the supposed convenience of ordering online.The internet and all of it's convenience is of absolutely no value if you don't make proper use of it.GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER !
