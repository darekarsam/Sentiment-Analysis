4	Japan House has an amazing ambience. The architecture is the most unique I've seen, definitely in central IL. The gardens and lake are awesome too!Every week, they have a 'Tea Ceremony'. They serve unsteeped tea and it is a very intricate ceremony. Pretty cultural. It's nice to see how they do things in Japan and experience it. It's pretty authentic.. I'd recommend going to anyone who is at all interested in learning more about the world!
5	I love the rock garden out front and the lakes nearby. It gives a calming effect. I haven't been to the ceremony yet, but I do plan on seeing it soon!
5	I was not expecting this in the middle of Illinois. The white cherry blossoms were incredible. We came on a sunny day and the flowers were in full bloom. It was gorgeous. Saw a lot of students running around the lake. If I lived there, I'd do the same!
