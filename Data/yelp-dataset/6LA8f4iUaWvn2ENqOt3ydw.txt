5	The salon room is clean and chic. Shelly did a great job of finding out what I was looking for in a hair cut; clean, stylish, and easy to maintain and style. Both Shelly and Jason we're very amicable and charismatic.
5	Awesome service:) Jason is my favorite, I am super picky when it comes to my hair and he always goes above and beyond my expectations:) would definitely recommend.
5	I followed my colorist from his previous salon and am so glad that I did - once you find a colorist you trust you follow them anywhere! Jason is AMAZING with color. I have all over platinum, which is deceptively difficult, and only trust Jason with my hair. I even have other hair are professionals asking where I get it done. The salon is centrally located in Tempe off of Mill Ave. and has super close parking. Do yourself a favor and book with Jason and Shelley, you won't be disappointed.
