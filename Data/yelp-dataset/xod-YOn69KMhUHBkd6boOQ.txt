5	I really trust the guys at Monona Motors. I feel that their prices are fair, and they will explain things in lay-man's terms. I feel fortunate to have an honest, quality garage like this in my neighborhood.
5	Great work at a fair price. I recommend without hesitation.
5	Don't let the rough exterior fool you, but this place is great! John and his crew were very honest and personable. Would recommend without hesitation!
5	Happy to echo the sentiments here - good, honest shop with fair prices.No up-sell here - I've actually had them tell me I didn't need work after another shop tried to tell me I did.  Keeps me coming back, for sure.Awesome building, and historic - apparently, the city of Monona was founded there! http://www.mymonona.com/pages/parks_recreation/parks_open_space/details.php/31/parks_open_space/schluter+beach/ If you have time, grab an ice cream at the bait shop a couple of doors down, and wander over to the lake.
