1	This is most certainly NOT a Fry's Marketplace. Fry's Marketplaces sell all of the home goods, this one is definitely not one. I just walked in and all of the floors are ripped up, tres sanitary! Plus it's dingy and small. Blech!
4	this is just a regular frys Food and Drug not a marketplace but I still like it. in an out within minutes, the lines never take too long no waits. everything is different than the fry I'm used to going but overall it is a good one. never saw any dirtiness or anything like that
4	This is definitely Fry's, but by far NOT a Marketplace. But it will do. It's smaller, so you're in and out... Not much to ponder over! The store was clean. Staff was on the floor making sure that sale items remained stocked. I love the olive bar. It had a variety of olives, mushrooms, onions, garlic, etc. Produce was appealing. There are several self-checkout kiosks...which I don't use. I like to see just how pleasant the cashiers are.
