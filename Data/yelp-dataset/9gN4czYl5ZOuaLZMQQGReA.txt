5	Great Service! Excellent Prices! I made calls to several companies, some didn't get back to me, most were very costly. I had a big job, removal of two 30+ year old Oleander bushes, removal of two diseased mature trees, cleaning of a 60 foot plus Elm tree, and general clean up of several other large bushes and stumps. John and his crew went above and beyond my expectations and all for $1000 less then every other company. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
5	Prompt, efficient, fair price, left yards (front and back) clean & neat.  I highly recommend and will use again.
