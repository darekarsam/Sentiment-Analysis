4	Western Delights is such a cute store! My aunt and I went in there to check out there jewelry and there were so many gorgeous necklaces, bracelets, earrings and antique jewels there. I ended up buying a pair of earrings with blue stones and I love them.This store supports local artists, has reasonable prices, and the owner is super friendly and helpful. My aunt and I tried on a bunch of different pieces and the lady at the store knew so much about each one.I definitely recommend checking out this place the next time you're in the Scottsdale area and looking for jewelry from local artists.
5	Love this store! It's a wonderful place to find a unique affordable gift. The owner is super friendly and knowledgable. It seems as though there is a story or history associated with every item in the store. I especially love the jewelry here. I picked up a gorgeous pendant made by Navajo artists. I also have my eye on silver earrings and a few other things in the store. I will definitely shop here again and I plan to take all visiting family and friends too!
5	Very interesting collection of western trinkets....... Very reasonably priced local artists work....    See the picture... From jewelry to pottery.
5	We have been frequenting this store since it first opened.  As other reviews have commented Peg the owner supports local artists.  She is very knowledgeable and the stories behind some of the artisans and the pieces they make are very interesting.  We always manage to find some very unique pieces to give as gifts.
