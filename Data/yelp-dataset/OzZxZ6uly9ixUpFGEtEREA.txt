4	Beautiful looking pub with a wide selection of Quebec and Belgium beer and Irish whiskey. Quite impressive! The decor is authentic with a real Irish pub feel. The only thing I really didn't like was the music. It's an Irish pub; why are you playing Tupac and The Talking Heads? Where's the Irish and folk music? I found that really took away for the place. The music was also really loud which made it hard to talk to the person next to you. Other than that the service was great. The staff was friendly, attentive and bilingual. A big plus considering the area! Most bars refuse to speak any English in the Hochelaga area.
3	Let me be honest here... The problem is not the pub. The problem is me. I don't seem to be a fan of pub food. I ordered nachos and they came SUPER well done (like burnt to a black crisp). My boyfriend's poutine was MEH... But the drinks were good! And the staff were amazing!
