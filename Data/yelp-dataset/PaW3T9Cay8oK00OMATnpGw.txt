2	the produce section gave my stomach a Charley Horse . I almost passed out walking by the big stack of bagged potatoes that were giving off a strong stink that was worst than 100 cat liter boxes . I also saw peppers that were shrived rotten and with unknown white stuff coming out of them . Once in a while you can find a true bargain that you may or may not need like a #10 can of cocktail sauce that is still in date or warm designer dog coats for our chilly summers . good LUCK! and happy hunting .
4	always great stuff. I've been to better ones. But this one is pretty neat, good selection and excellent parking!
