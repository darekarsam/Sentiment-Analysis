2	this store has gotten better with there produce but still has a long way to go for me to shop here over our locale frys the great thing about this store is so few people go here that its easy getting in and out if you need some basic food items. the paking lot has shopping carts all over the place because people seem to be very lazy and none caring where they leave there carts none the less for a none busy store there staff does not seem to manage this issue. i think they need to rethink who there customer coud be and not assume its the ageing retirement communitys and focus on people who are looking for better quality product
4	What's good for me is not always good for this store. I like that it is not very crowded. I am old and handicapped, so I like the smaller store size and friendly staff. I can't comment on prices. I really don't buy that much. If I wanted a mega-madhouse like Fry's or Walmart I would go there. I do miss Bayless and Smitty's though.
5	Awesome customer service ! They are always opening up registers when needed and the employees are beyond helpful and nice. Highly recommended.
