5	Debbie is an amazing manicurist and she also does meticulous art work! Her line work is nothing less than perfect. Looking for a unique style or something complex - she can do it! My nails look awesome - thanks Debbie!!
5	Im from LA but every time I'm in Vegas, it's a MUST to get my nails done from Debbie. She has amazing quality in her work and she gives suggestions that definitely do not disappoint- colors, etc. Debbie is very flexible with her hours and works around YOUR time, which is hard to find. And she's very easy to talk to. Makes the time pass by quickly. None of that awkward silence stuff! Sooo happy I found Lacquer Me Up!!
5	By far, one of the best manicure/pedicure experiences. Debbie is a gem, she is friendly and takes pride in her work. She gives great suggestions and on trend with colors/style. She uses high quality product and hygenic! Debbie you are awesome!
