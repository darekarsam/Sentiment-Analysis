4	For an airport restaurant, this place is really quite good.  We had the "curry feast for two." For 15 pounds we had the Chicken Jalfrezi and the Lamb Rogan Josh - both were excellent. The price also included two drinks, a pint of Fosters and a glass of wine. Oh, yes, and some poppadums were included, along with some naan and chutney. A real treat and not a bad bargain to boot.
4	Probably the best airport restaurant/pub I've been to in ages. Typical 'Spoons fare, but price-adjusted for the airport set. Still, quite reasonable. Good food, cold drinks, pleasant service. While waiting for a flight, I couldn't ask for better.
3	Devoid of atmosphere, but that is the same for all airport pubs. Why am I giving it three stars, you might then ask. Well it's the beer!They have an excellent array of craft beers, Rogue, Brooklyn, Goose Island to name just a few.  On top of that it is comfortable and clean and a good stop as you wait excitedly for your plane to arrive to take you to sunnier lands. The best bar at  this airport by far.
