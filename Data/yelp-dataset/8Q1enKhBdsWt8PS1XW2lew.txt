4	This place is not just like any normal Panda Express because we are the first to have our very own Panda Express Tea Bar! We have teas ranging from Oolong up to our most popular Mango Freeze! You can also get drinks either hot or cold.. Or for those who love Boba you can add them on as well!! When is drinking boba ever a wrong thing?!?!! Plus enjoying it with the world famous orange chicken?!?!  So come by and say hello to the new and exciting things we have at this new store!
4	Manager of the restaurant, Gus, was super kind! The staff was helpful and patient. Food was good, but the temperature of the food was cold. Samples of food and specialty drinks we're be given out to guests.
3	Although I love Panda, this location is a rip off for no reason at all. When ordering, I was told that the "premium" items, which included the honey walnut shrimp, was a dollar extra. Of course, I'm wondering if this shrimp is cooked any different than the other locations. They said no. So why the extra charge? "Because it's Downtown Summerlin." The dumbest answer ever. I won't be returning.
4	Panda Express is.. well, Panda Express. The food here is exactly what you expect. Of course there is the extra charge for the "premium side" like all other locations. This particular location though, has an updated decor and a tea bar!The decor has a modern-contemporary flair which was really nice. They also have a Panda Tea Bar that serves drinks just like a boba tea shop. I gave it a try and for my usual which was an Almond Milk Green Tea with Honey Boba. Boba was made perfectly! Soft and chewy. The drink, however, was really sweet!! It was good but way too sweet. They need to take it easy on the sugar.
