5	The salads were amazing and the service was excellent.  This is definitely a repeat for our group.
2	Salads are good - but everything is very expensive and the manager treats the employees like dirt.  I've seen it first hand multiple times.
4	I have never heard of Salad Creations, probably because I don't have one where I live, but I wish I did. I was in Wisconsin where I found Salad Creations and I tried their Apple Pecan Salad, and oh my goodness it was delicious; everything went well together in it and it wasn't drenched in dressing. The inside of the building was average, nothing fancy but it went with the atmosphere. The only reason this place got 4 stars is that I wasn't greeted with a "welcome to Salad Creations" or anything; other than that I would defiantly go again. I highly recommend this place if you are in the mood for a light and healthy meal.
2	Salad was good, but very expensive! I also thought I would add on a bottle of water and my total was over $11.00! (The salad was 7.99, so $3 for a small bottle of water???) i thought hey, I'll help a local business out... Never again! I was also curious about nutritional/ ingredients of the salad dressings and was treated very rudely. The young girl that helped me was very nice, but the older woman was not nice at all. So much for supporting a local business.
1	My family and I were craving salads tonight so someone suggested salad creations. We live about 30 minutes away from salad creations and when we got there they were closed....at 7:15. The lights were completely off, chairs up and no one inside. Why say you are open until 8 when you are only ACTUALLY open until 7? We were all very disappointed to say the least. We won't be back for a very long time.
5	I love the salads here. It should be rated much Higher than 3 stars. They have great salads, and customer service.
