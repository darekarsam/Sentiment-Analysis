2	I had gone and checked out an apartment here about a month ago. I looked at a one/one and was not impressed. For the quoted cost ($800 plus trash and basic cable), the actually size of the place wasn't so bad (I believe it was 750sq ft), but it smelled like mildew as you walked up the stairs and into the apartment. Plus the appliances and cabinets were outdated and grungy. It didn't seem worth the money. Not to mention there were pipelines and exposed wires in the bedroom closet. I settled on a beautiful 2/2 with patio and fireplace somewhere else for the same cost as Camden's 1/1.

3	I lived here last year in one of the 2/1.5 townhouses. It's an alright apartment, no frills, nothing fancy. Older appliances. My air conditioner wasn't great and they refused to do a permanent fix, just temporary refilling of the coolant which would wear off after a few weeks. Plenty of parking. The gym is below average, just a few pieces of equipment. The pool is huge and great, probably one of the best amenities of the whole complex. The washer/dryers in the 2BR townhouses are in a separate shed-type room on the back patio which is a bit of an inconvenience, but the spacious back patio is nice and has a high fence for privacy. When it came time for me to renew they jacked the rent way up, and when I told them I couldn't pay that much they didn't seem to care at first, but then contacted me a few weeks later willing to negotiate on price. By then I had already signed a new lease elsewhere. But if they try to raise your rent, if you hold out long enough they'll play ball and work with you!
