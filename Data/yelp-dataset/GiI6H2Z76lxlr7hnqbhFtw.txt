4	Really great coffee shop in between downtown and the strip.  I think it may even be better than 21st Street Coffee.  This location also serves some Korean food.  The bulgogi sandwich was not bad.  I would like to try some other things on the menu.  Nevertheless, the mocha I had here was a winner.  I definitely will be back.  It's a must try if you're near the convention center or working nearby.
1	Terrible. Tried the bulgogi sandwich, chicken noodle soup, and a mocha frap - none of it was good and it was as expensive as the awesome deli dinner I has the night before.
4	I just moved to a new building downtown and all of my old coffee shops are now too far away (I'm lazy) so I decided to go try Sandpresso. I ordered a latte so I cannot comment on the food (yet, I'll be back to try those I'm sure) and I really liked the coffee! It's worth the trip to visit if you work downtown and the owner was very friendly!
4	The food offerings are a bit interesting, but I made it just in time to get a fresh baked scone.  Clearly not made from scratch, but still delicious.  The latte is good and way better than the watered-down espresso of Crazy Mocha.  They have coffee happy hour from 7a - 9a, so I am looking forward to going back for a good cup of coffee in the morning.  On this side of downtown there are NO decent coffee shops, so I am excited to find this place.
