5	Good place for student who need tasty food but don't want to spend too much money.I always order 1kg meat with my friends. It's a good portion for 2 people. Also their sandwich is great, plus you can ask them to add some fries  inside the sandwich to make it better.Place won't give you a good impression since it's a small place and not so clean. You should call it before you go for take-out. Save your time and make you happy.
3	I hadn't been to Farhat in a few years.While the prices are decent, the quality, service (a little lost, best to order ahead) and premises (still grungy) falls short.Most people get the sandwich with their choice of meat,  but I tend to favor the kilo mix ($22).You get 2 regular and 2 spicy Kefta kebabs , 2 ground chicken kebabs as well as 2 chicken breast kebab and 2 "filet mignon" skewers.It tastes vary from Ok to just good, they add a salad and some hummus, garlic sauce and harissa.The best part is the spicy bread grilled over charcoal and the bottom pita that catches the oil drippings.This is just my opinion,  but the staff are North African making Levantine cuisine. That could explain why the hummus is from a can, the lack of SUMAC and offering french fries and baguettes.The Spanish might make decent pizza and the Chinese can have a go at Sushi, but most recognize the best place to get ethnic food is at the source.
