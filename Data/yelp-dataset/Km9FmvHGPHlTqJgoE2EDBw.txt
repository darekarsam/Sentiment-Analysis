4	My favorite cafe next to the boardwalk. TWIGS (Two West Island GirlS) is my walk to comfort zone any day of the week. Friendly staff, decadent desserts and sugar free cookies (with honey...) o_O  Much love.
4	Great coffee and sandwich with a cozy atmosphere!
5	Their custom grilled sandwiches and cakes are amazing!! Definitely try the carrot cake. Very warm and inviting atmosphere. Best cafe in St Anne!!
