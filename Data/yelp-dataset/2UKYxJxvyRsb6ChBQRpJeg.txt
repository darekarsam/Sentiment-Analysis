4	Does 4 stars seem high for an auto store? I gave this auto zone that bcuz they had a good selection of steering covers and car smelly goods which is what I came for great customer service too plus I guess I needed some antifreeze which was on sale. I'll be back!
1	not very knowledgeable. . . came in for an inline 15 amp fuse and holder . . . The dude couldn't find a 15 but suggested his 30 would be fine!! Might as well have connected the wires and waited for something to melt ;-)
5	Mario the store manager is one of the best employees autozone has. I travel for my job so I pass a lot of autozones and have sampled most in the valley and for that matter auto part stores in general. Mario has never not been able to help and always has a happy and cheerful attitude. I have all vintage cars and tractors and he has never been stumped.
