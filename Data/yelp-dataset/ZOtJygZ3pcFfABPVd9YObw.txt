5	I've been going here for about 5 years now. Kim does an excellent job on my hair. She really listens to my description and is willing to change to accommodate. The color and cut always comes out beautiful. Louie is the upbeat owner and stylist and really just makes you feel welcome (plus he's an avid Salsa dancer and may show you a move or two!). I've lived in various parts of the city and actually make it a point travel to get here. Tucked away in residential Greenfield, this is truly a hidden gem.
