4	Had their lobster roll for lunch!  Yum, yum, yum.  Sweet, tender lobster dressed lightly with mayo, chopped celery and red onions!!!  I'll be on a look out for the best lobster roll this summer.  Look for my list.
4	Tons of fresh fish and other seafood.  Totally love the place because they silk quality stuff at the best prices downtown...
