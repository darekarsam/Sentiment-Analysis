5	this is the best dentist in the valley. excellent care and the friendlest office staff..looking for a new dentist you can't go wrong with this one.
5	Best Dentist & Staff! I love Dr. Patrick & Staff. Wish I wouldn't have moved so far away but won't be changing now. Responsive, knowledgable, kind, caring,& professional. Dr. Patrick is up to date & will do whatever he can but also not step outside his wheel-house which is appreciatd since we all have strengths, nice to have someone say when they won't do it all - speciality is appreciated. I recommend to anyone & everyone especially if your afraid of dentist, you won't be after Dr. Patrick, promise!
5	I was referred to absolute dental by a coworker and hadn't been to the dentist in two years, so I was nervous! Since the moment I called to make an appointment to my checkout my experience was great! Very Clean!! Sandy, the hygienist and Patrick are awesome and have ready scheduled my sixth month followup!
