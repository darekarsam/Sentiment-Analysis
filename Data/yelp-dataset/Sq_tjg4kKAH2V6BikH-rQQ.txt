4	They were sooo helpful and very speedy after I locked my keys in my car. I think it was 69 bucks, which seems reasonably priced to me.
5	I needed to have three locks re-keyed as well as duplicate keys made. The people there were friendly and straightforward. The locks work well and they charged a very fair price. I'm very happy with the service!
