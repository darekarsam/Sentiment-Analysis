1	Nothing much has changed here.  I needed a specific product and tried to call the store, no answer.  As it was just after 5 PM on a Saturday, this was possible, but they are close-by and I took a chance.  When I got there I found the store open, empty except for the salesgirl, who was staring out the front window while the phone rang off the hook.  When I asked why she didn't answer the phone she got snotty.  Then when I asked for the product she said "This store doesn't carry that stuff".  I left with no purchase and a vow I will not return here!
5	I don't know why this store has such terrible reviews, I went in there and the two people the store knew their stuff and were extremely helpful! They greeted me when I came in the door and answered every question I had! Definitely will be coming back here :)
3	Now that I am an official Quest Bar junkie General Nutrition Center's Buy 2 get 1 free make them my new best friend.    It's also the only place I've found Isopure even though I only like on flavor and everyone else apparently like the same one so I often have to order it.Stores are routinely bright and spotlessly clean and so far the employees seem helpful and reasonably informed.One employee did tell me there was phenylalinine (sp?) in Quest bars which caused me a moment of panic because that stuff gets me wired out of my mind but I put my glasses on and read the fine print... not on the ingredient list!
