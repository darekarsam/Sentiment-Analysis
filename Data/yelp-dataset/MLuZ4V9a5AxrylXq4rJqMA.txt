5	I had a great experience with this company. I had been planning a move from Columbus, OH to Charlotte, NC as I was transferring with my job. I originally had one moving company in Columbus, OH set up but I had to move the date back and they could not accommodate my new move date.  New Beginnings was able to do a last minute move for me at a great price. They even came shortly after the winter storm they had. They were careful with my belongings and very professional. They delivered my furniture the next day and I was very satisfied with the whole process, I'm not sure what I would have done without them! I would definitely recommend this company to anyone moving in this area.
5	This was our second time using New Beginnings.  Both moves were local, inside the city limits.  We were extremely pleased with the quality of service and the price.  The movers themselves were extremely helpful, very kind, and efficient.  Highly recommended.
5	These guys have moved me three times. The first time I found them was in an emergency when my movers didn't show up--these were the only guys who could come within 24 hours and didn't charge an outrageous price for it.  They also moved my dad (who was in his 80s), and now they've moved one of my coworkers and one of my neighbors. Always a good price, always kind, and always professional. Anytime somebody asks me for a mover, I send them to these guys.
