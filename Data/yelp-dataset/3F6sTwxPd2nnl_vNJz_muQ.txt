1	This was probably one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to. The portions were the size of appetizers for the price of a main, the meat was overcooked and so dry and flavourless that it was un-edible. Save your money and go almost anywhere else in the city, this place was beyond bad.
1	Come here if you want to be disappointed.  Or if you like undercooked sweet potato fries mixed with burnt sweet potato strings... Where is Chef Ramsay when you need him?!
3	I went there for lunch and luckily we had a reservation because it was a full house. Took the 13,50$ lunch which was absolutely delicious but the portion was small for the price. I had an excellent falafel brochette & grilled feta. If it wasn't so expensive, I'd go back for sure.
1	I took my mom there because she's gluten intolerant and she saw on the internet that they had a special menu. The waiter had a condescending attitude towards us as soon as we walked through the door. We were the only clients there but he didn't greet us and barely acknowledged our presence. When he finally came to hand us the menu, he didn't give a flying duck about my mom's intolerance and was really rude about it. When I started to get impatient he told me to "breathe". Needless to say that we left without ordering and on rather bad terms.
5	We LOVED this place. We wanted a special meal to make our evening in Montreal perfect - and we found it!  The host and the owner met us at the street and talked about their recommendations. They were so nice and warm, we couldn't go anywhere else. The opening "salad plates" were incredible, especially the outstanding hummus!  I had the schnitzel, which was really great. But the real hit was my partner's steak kabob. Wow!  It was a great meal, great house wine, and the nicest people. We're going back next time!
