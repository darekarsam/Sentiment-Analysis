5	Beautiful course and the clubhouse is very elegant! I love their pro shop because they offer 40% discount on their clothing for members our guest of members! a their Loud Mouth collection is awesome, but I wish they had more skorts! Oh yeah, just remember, all of the putts break toward the valley!
5	The Executive Chef is quite handsome!
1	Be careful here.  No way to discontinue - locked in for a year.Club is not very welcoming, not very flexible and average regarding amenities.Their 'trial membership' is not the deal it appears to be.
5	Went to a bridal shower here today. Food & service was wonderful. We had a salad bar with choice of chicken or salmon to top it off. Beautiful views, great decor & comfortable atmosphere.
2	Really an average course that was fairly easy. The bummer was no beverage cart when we played Saturday and it was 100. I would not golf here again.
1	We joined this club in 2006 and resigned five years later-very stand offish people and course that was too easy! Beware of the friendly "sales pitch" when you ask about a membership-what you see is not what you get! Food is just average in the club house and menu does not change at all. Friendly bartenders at the West facing bar with the great view, but that's about it!
