5	Small to medium sized Lulu store on the Rue St. Denis looks pretty old school (almost "vintage") from the outside  -- this store might be one of the first established in the city, I'm guessing.  They have good selection at this store; I could find more things in my size and more patterns and designs.  Hard to come into this store and not drop some serious coin - you are sure to find something.  The sales racks are huge although it was hard to contemplate wearing a jacket or hoodie when its 90 degrees at home, so passed on that.  If I was feeling spendy I would have picked up a few more things but felt the need to be on the conservative side on this visit.
2	Small shop located on St. Denis in the Plateau. The reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the stuff are very indifferent and not that helpful. If this were a self-srve it would amount to about the same thing. If I'm going to pay big money on yoga clothes, I expect a high level of service to go with it.
