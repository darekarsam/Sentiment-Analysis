5	Our new favorite! My wife and I came for a late breakfast and coffee. We ordered the quinoa pancakes and French toast with fresh whipped cream and berry compote and a couple of lattes. Service: Very friendly. I chatted with employee John for a couple of minutes and felt very welcomed. I definitely noticed the great care taken by all staff when taking the order, preparing it, and delivering it. They clearly want your experience to be memorable. Food: The food was delicious. French toast was slightly crispy and not soggy, which was a nice change. The pancakes were tasty as well. The freshly whipped cream was a nice touch, and the berry compote was very flavorful. Out lattes were some of the most silky I've had. Ambience: Beautiful bronze tiled ceiling and paint color choices. Nothing really on the walls quite yet but was told there will be soon. The tables and chairs were modern and comfortable. The Wi-Fi was a little confusing though. Overall: Bead and Berry is a fresh and hip new place for Maricopa. We look forward to our next visit and can't wait to try the keylime smoothie!
5	Great local spot.  Awesome coffee prepared anyway you can imagine it.  Free WiFi to get some work done while enjoying your coffee or breakfast.  I have had breakfast here twice and I can't get away from the delicious French Toast - real maple syrup and sweet cream. Staff is very friendly and the music playing is always on point.  A real treat in Maricopa.
