1	went to get my nails done for the first time today. I was not impressed. They used the rotary file to file the tips, and burned my finger, every nail was filed crooked. I have a good mind to go get my money back!
5	My wife and I have gone to this place countless times along with our daughter. My wife always gets a full pedi with flower etc. pricing is average but all of the staff are good. I don't always want to get a full pedi, so I just get a callous removal which is $10.00. I don't need all the extras and there seems to be nowhere else in chandler that does this for $10.00. We will continue to go back!!
5	I have been coming to Victoria Nails for years.  Absolutely love Tina the owner and all staff.  Very professional and I never have to wait.  The salon is very clean,great prices and amazing staff.   Tina is the bestMichelle
