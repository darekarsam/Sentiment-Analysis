4	The only reason I knew about this place was a hand lettered sign stuck into the ground outside the Viet Hoa grocery. Some authentic items here, including congee. We had the General's Chicken, Mao Po Tofu and Curry Chicken. The food arrived very quickly to our table, and it was good. The General's Chicken was spicy but complex. The Mao Po Tofu was generous. The Curry Chicken was mild. This is a small rectangle of space within Viet Hoa devoted to a tiny restaurant. But it felt for a moment like we were back in a corner of San Francisco's Chinatown. For that alone and the attentive staff we will go back and try some of the more adventurous dishes.
5	We took our food home and were very happy with our choices. Egg rolls were large and delicious. The price was only one dollar. Delightful! We had cashew shrimp. The shrimp were large and there was a delicious variety of vegetables . The chicken with mushrooms was outstanding. The portion was large and the sauce was superb. Best Chinese we have had in Madison.
5	They will make you items not on the menu.  Nice family-owned place and real Chinese food
5	Had another wonderful dish last evening. I asked for Onchoy and Joe said they weren't fresh and so I asked him to cook any vegetable. He cooked a vegetable we never had before and it was amazing. My wife said she wants it again. Heads up - Joe's Kitchen is moving to West side of town and doing what he loves - dim sum! Let's give him and his family support to stay in Madison. In my 30 years in Madison, I have to say this is what I would consider as real Chinese cooking.
5	Sorry to discover that Joe's Kitchen is gone, as in moved out. No one seems to know where.  Too bad. The food was great, and Joe and Jenny were really nice. Hope they can find a new home.  Even if it is across town, it's worth the drive.
