5	YAy and super yum. This tiny cafe houses all the lovingly homemade magic Montrealers will remember from Il Piatto della Nonna back in the day, but in quick, inexpensive and easybreezy cafe form. The staff are still getting their feet under them so yes, the top of my ciabatta sandwich was burned, but honestly that couldn't touch the incredible flavour of the high quality meat and veggies used, and at $5 for the daily sandwich including a coffee I will be back for sure for sure. The decor here is also lovely, big think wooden tables, soft light from hanging lamps, and racks of Nonna's homemade sauce in japs for your to take home, plus lasagnes ready for you in the fridge.
4	This place is cheap and good.$6.50 , tax included, for a veal sausage ciabatta, latte and a side of risotto. This place is ridiculously small, they do make coffee, but it's not the kind of place where you can lounge for hours.The only drawback is they seem to run out of lots of stuff, so no selection when i went there.
