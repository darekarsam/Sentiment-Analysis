5	I am so happy with cole brothers pool service! I own a rental property in Vegas and my pool looks so good I thought they must have put blue food dye in it! Night and day difference! It looked good before but, man, whatever they did, made a huge difference! It looks like a 5 star resort pool now! They take their time, go above and beyond with their service, and are just great to work with! I have a motto "it's no fun to pay someone you don't love". And I love these guys! Thank you cole brothers!
5	It's really hard to keep pools clean in Vegas as most of you probably know. However, I am amazed every week at how clean my pool is. I am so much happier with Cole Brothers than the previous service we used. They are consistent and do great work! I definitely recommend them to anyone looking for excellent service (and the pricing is very fair).
1	I called Ted originally on Wednesday 7/23/14 to come out to the house to fix something on the pool pump. I set up the appointment for 10am the next morning.  I wanted the pump fixed prior to leaving town for a few days. No call no show. I tried calling the number but went straight to voicemail. I left him a message to call me back but didn't hear back until later that afternoon. So he apologized for not being to come that day. When we got back from the trip I sent him a message to see if he would be able to come to the house again. He replied that he could come Tuesday 7/29/14 at 5:30pm. NO CALL NO SHOW AGAIN. I finally left him a message not to bother coming out and that we will have someone else take care of it. EXTREMELY UNRELIABLE EVEN AFTER 2 APPOINTMENTS!!  I would not use them. A complete waste of my time.
