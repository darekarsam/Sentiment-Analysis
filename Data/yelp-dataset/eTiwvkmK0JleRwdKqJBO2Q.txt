5	Sue did an amazing job on my cake! It was delicious and beautiful!
5	By far, this was the best cake I have ever had. Sue was wonderful to work with. She made my cake exactly as I had asked. She had wonderful communications. It was a great experience from start to finish. I would highly recommend using her for all of your cake needs.
5	Sue was wonderful to work with for our wedding cake.  We were so happy we found her - she was so professional and easy to work with!  We knew right away we would have no worries about our cake.  Her ideas and suggestions were really helpful and the cake turned out fantastic!
5	For anyone debating whether or not Sue is your dream cake gal, let me vouch for the fact that she is! She is kind and patient and so incredibly talented! It's rare for a cake to look great AND taste amazing - she did both for my wedding! She was on top of her communication with me and we were able to organize everything for the wedding from 3000 miles away. Thank you Sue Jacobs Cakes you're the best!
