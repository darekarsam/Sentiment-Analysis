4	I like sushi...real sushi so i was surprised to see a "fusion" sushi place get such high reviews. After trying it, it's not bad at all. First, their rice is good: not just cooked properly but finally a somewhat affordable sushi place with properly seasoned rice. One down side, it's very slow to get serve. So i suggest to order early, and.. it's good.
5	Amazing sushi! Made with love and plenty of flavors! Fresh, affordable with great personalized service from the twin chefs....it's the perfect joint for a cozy dinner or lunch or even take out. Fusion at its best! Ask for the specialities of the house - you will love them!
5	This place is amazing! I am a sushi connoisseur, I have traveled the world and ate in large, small, fancy, family-styled, name it all: all kinds of sushi restaurants and I have to say I was beyond impressed with their sushi. The sushi is delicious. Try their DRAGON TONGUE: house specialty crispy with a kick. It's succulent! Their fish is fresh, service is friendly, sushi rolls are innovative and prices are competitive. I absolutely recommend this place!!! The restaurant is small so make sure to reserve if you want to dine it.
3	Great sushi quality for such casual settings! Basic sushis as well an in-house creations are offered for takeout or dine in for a great price (most rolls under $10). Great side dishes available, such as tartares.  Vietnamese owners, but they master their craft!
