1	I had a DUI a few years ago and based on this law office's great "client testimonials" they could get out of my situation.  8 months later and $5,000.00 lighter in the pocket i was being told by my attorney "Here, sign this. Your getting 10 days in tent city, paying $4,800 in fines, getting the ignition interlock, and have to take DUI classes."This law office didn't do anything for me despite having 100% positive reviews on their website.  Well, i guess its true, never trust an attorney....
