4	$9.75 for a filling roast beef sandwich, bag of chips, chocolate chip cookie, and bottle of water.  Not Bad.This location is about a block away from Subway.  I'm out in Madison for a conference (Chicago is home) and wanted something cheap, good, fast, and filling and I would say I got it!  This place is also similar to Jimmy John's but the sandwich was more filling.The place was empty at dinner time, clean and efficient.
5	I LOVE Milios but I like this location a tad more because they have Diet Mt Dew on the soda machine (some others dont)  Subs are always delicious but the Cheesy tortilla soup is amaaaazing! ! Kasey who works here is awesome. Always friendly.
