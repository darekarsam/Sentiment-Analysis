3	Formerly the Pittsburgh Deli Company's second floor...  I have to admit, I kind of miss the grunge-y bar of old, but this place had potential when I saw it.  Very beautifully decorated, but RIDICULOUSLY loud.  Everything echoes.  My friends and I left because it was so darn loud that you had to scream just to talk to the person next to you.  It's too bad about that because this place has potential.  Hopefully, they'll fix the problem.  But don't get me wrong, it doesn't stop the young Shadyside professionals from showing up!
2	REVIEW EDIT - All the house music has been removed. Now there's really nothing left to hit up Alto for. Nice looking space, but nobody there to use it. Sorry Alto, you had something good and you dropped the ball.
2	The concept is great and lacking on Walnut, a decent priced lounge catering to the just out of college crowd. Similar to but larger than Soba and closer to the number of bars on Walnut, Alto lounge is a great lounge if you are looking for a pure lounge.The staff, at times, can be kind of cold and don't think you'll be able to have any sort of conversation because of the way too loud music.  While it isn't great, it is a nice lounge for the area without having to travel too far.
3	Good place for a group.Drunk bartenders and ipod music. Not so bad.(b)
