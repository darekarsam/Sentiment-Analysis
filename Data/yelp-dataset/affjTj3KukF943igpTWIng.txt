5	I just moved to the neighborhood and I've been trying out local places. I was craving Chinese food for lunch and remembered seeing Good Taste House when I was driving down 7th Street. My first instinct was to check yelp, and I must admit I was weary when I didn't see any reviews. However, every time I drive by, it smells really tasty, so I decided to give it a shot.My boyfriend and I ordered two of the rice bowl lunch specials. He got the orange chicken, and I had the chicken with broccoli, both on a bed of steamed rice. Delicious! They are about the size of a panda bowl from Panda Express but so much tastier! And the price - it's a steal at $3.99! You can upsize the lunch special to come with fried rice, a spring roll and a crab puff for $2 more.I can't wait to try more of the items on the menu based on my experience today. I'm attaching the menu in the photos. Hopefully the presence of a Yelp review will drive more business their way, because it's definitely a hidden gem. :)
3	The food is very good. I have no complaints with their food at all. The issue is their service. Horrible service. It literally took 2 hours to arrive. No apology. When asked why it took so long, they replied "were busy" in a rude tone. I would give this 1 star if the food wasn't really good
3	Here is my biggest problem.  They need to work on delivery times. 2 hours is not appropriate,  as well as not receiving any thing for my inconvenience.  I work In a business where leaving is not always possible. There fore waiting for 2 hours is not going to continue my business with them. Now the only redeeming factor was how great the food was. This might get me to consider using them again, but if it take this long next time there will be some compensation.
5	Crazy fast, delicious, came up to the window of my car and made me cry. Good overall
1	Placed my order at 803. Came exactly 1 hour later food was cold my sesame chicken spilled the whole bag was sticky from the sauce. Ordered house looks mein. It had absolutely No flavor it suckered hardly any noodles I wouldn't pay more than 4$ for it yet I paid double. Spring rolls are meh. OK crab puffs. I will not be ordering from here again it sucks.I will stick to super dragon on 12st and northern
5	This place is INCREDIBLE!! Open late and super delicious!! Ask for Mike! He will take great care of ya!
5	Love this place.   Egg rolls,  hot and sour soup,  amazing.   You must try this place.   Oh yeah,  take out only and call ahead.   Worth the effort.
5	Checked yelp tonight for Chinese delivery and ended up choosing this place. Delivery was exactly as described time wise, and the food was incredible. Great portions for a good price, and nothing sketchy! Will definitely be ordering from them again.
4	If it weren't for the concrete-block walls, I could have sworn this was a Valentine diner; I love those now nearly extinct '50s-style mini-eateries. You can't really dine in this place except in the 1-table "patio" area near the entrance, since the kitchen takes up most of the little building. That means that it's mainly a take-out and delivery place. The entrance is where you order your food from the friendly lady inside. The food is quite good, a tad above most of the Chinese take-out places that I've tried in the city.
5	Gotta love a good ol fashion mom n pop spot. This place has great food at a good price, you wont be disappointed.
5	I used to be a line cook in a Japanese restaurant. I know how good Asian food is supposed to taste. So I can confidently tell you; for outstanding Asian food, Good Taste House succeeds in several ways:1) The name of the place is just delightful, I mean look at it. It's like something from a cartoon. I love it.2) The soy sauce they include with delivery is real, naturally brewed, Kimlan soy sauce. Not that artificially colored & flavored filth that almost every other chinese place uses. I can tell the difference, and it is disgusting. Good Taste House cares about you and provides Soy Sauce that doesn't insult your palate or intelligence. (Yes. I feel that strongly about this.)3) I can taste the slightly singe of the noodles that have been cooked fresh, in a wok, over a flame. You can't fake that flavor and after having it myself over and over for so long I didn't realize how much I missed it until we ordered from Good Taste House. It's just...correct.4) Their delivery zone is huge. I mean, really. I was impressed.5) Their egg rolls and spring rolls stand out from other asian delivery in a big way. I'm not sure, but they taste handmade but they could just be a higher quality. Either way, big fan.6) Their sweet & sour sauce tastes the way I used to make it myself. In fact, everything there tastes as good as if I made it myself, at the peak of my abilities, in a restaurant, with all the proper equipment and tools readily in front of me. I can make decent Chinese food at home, but an electric range just doesn't cook the same way. This place nails it. THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED. Well deserving of five stars.Fair Warning: Delivery times can be a little long because of their big coverage area. Ours didn't take *that* long but I'm willing to wait for food this good to be brought to my door. (Also, come on, the building is practically a shack. They're gonna get backed up.)
1	I'd comment on the food but unfortunately I never got the chance to try it. Two hours after placing my order and one call saying the delivery driver was 10 minutes away, I finally call again to find out they were out of pot stickers and hadn't even left yet. They said they called multiple times, which I never got any of their calls. I canceled the order after a total of two hours and 10 minutes for waiting. Terrible service and no compensation for their error.
