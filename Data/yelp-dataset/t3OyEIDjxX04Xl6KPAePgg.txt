5	Super delicious food!!!  Love this place!
5	Absolutely love this place. Great service and the yellow chicken curry is perfect every time. We love their fried strips of chicken to dip in curry sauce. Duck is amazing and the pat-see-yew is always good
5	Excellent food. Love love love!! Definitely give this place a try. Quick service and oh so yummy :))
5	Food is super tasty!  Delicious flavors and textures.  Just the right amount of sauces and curries per dish.  I ordered the Vegetarian Yellow Curry, which was top notch perfect!  I don't remember what my parents ordered, but they were equally as delighted and satisfied as I was.  I cannot wait to return.  Also, the ambiance and decor inside is really nice!  I like the detailed woodwork and artwork.  Family run!
5	I've been here 3 times this week and really love the fresh flavorful dishes!The food is delicious and the staff is so friendly...I'm going to miss this place when I have to fly home.
3	Rude staff, tried to take away the menu before I finished ordering. Asked for desert and gave us the check instead.Food is nothing special. Had better Thai food elsewhere.
5	I've been coming here for years. The prices are fair, the portions are reasonable and the taste is great.
2	We ordered Tom Kha Gah (soup) and Drunken noodle. The drunken noodle wasn't spicy at all and the soup didn't have any Thai curry in it (it was completely white with no orange tint). Disappointing because we were looking for a good Thai place in Charlotte. The atmosphere was nice but the food was just okay. Very little chicken in both the soup and the Drunken Noodle.
3	Pad Thai is a little too sweet for my liking. I've tried pad Thai at numerous locations throughout the U.S. and I have to say it didn't taste bad but it wasn't my favorite either. The waitress was hovering so I felt like I needed to make a quick decision. The spring roll that came with my meal was cold. Overall not a bad experience but I've had better.
