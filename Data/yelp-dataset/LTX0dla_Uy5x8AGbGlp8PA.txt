5	I have nothing bad to say about this place.  It's right by where I work and it's super convenient to walk here.  Every time I've come here I've gotten service pretty quick.  Store is nice and clean as well.  The have a rewards card problem so take advantage
5	I went in to get a turn signal replacement bulb. They had it in stock and during the purchase the salesman asked if I needed any tools to borrow since my car was right outside. I said, "sure, a Phillips head." He grabbed the screwdriver and handed me some plastic gloves and said, "let's go check it out." He proceeded to come outside with me and change the lightbulb without me ever asking. Above and beyond customer service. I would go back without question.
5	I was here earlier today trying to get the back of my moms SUV fixed & Christopher was extremely helpful. He told us we needed body clips to hold it back up. After brining out at least 6 diffent sizes we realized they did not have the correct size. I appreciated that he took the time to try them all & did everything so quickly. We originally had it taped up but took it off to show him where we were missing the piece so when we were heading out he offered to tape it up for us to prevent it from braking off. Although they did not have the part, I really appreciated how helpful he was & what a great attitude he had. He recommend we go to the dealership as they would have the correct size so we will be going there tomorrow. Overall GREAT customer service!
