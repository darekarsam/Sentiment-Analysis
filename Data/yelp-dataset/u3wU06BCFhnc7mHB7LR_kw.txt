4	The employees at this location are great they always try to help out with an extra buck or two when they can.This is the only pawn shop I trust my things at.
5	I have to say, I was a little nervous to come to a pawn shop and had never been till I came to Pawn 1st. I was referred by a friend. I had a bunch of jewelry that was left to me by my late grandma. Pawn 1st employees were very knowledgable, polite, were sensitive to my loss and didn't try to low ball me. I felt like I was being well taken care of. I know my grand mothers jewelry will find a better home. The store owner even came out and answered questions first hand and offered advice for other items I had of hers. Thank you Josh. I didn't know there were trust worthy businesses like this around any longer. I will definitely come back and refer friends and family.
5	Come see Rahul!!!!  He will hook you up! Very easy to person to work with.  A+ service!
