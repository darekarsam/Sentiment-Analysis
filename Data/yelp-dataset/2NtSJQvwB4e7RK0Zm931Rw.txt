5	SEO can be so confusing and overwhelming. When I got to LeRiche Marketing's website I felt like he was talking right to me. They put your mind at ease. I feel confident recommending them to clients.
5	I had always heard that paying for advertising online was like sinking money in a hole. Wow was that wrong. Eric at LeRiche Marketing showed me how I can spend a little on every click, and really build my client base. Just because I had to spend the money on Adwords, did mean I didn't make far more. Eric thanks for opening my eyes to one of the best investments I'd every make in my business!
5	Eric knows his stuff when it comes to online marketing. His systems and processes are set up to get results and I think he is a good guy that cares. Two thumbs up.
