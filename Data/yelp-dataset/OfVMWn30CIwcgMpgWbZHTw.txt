5	Great service and very helpful. State of the art knee and back braces They also have personally designed orthoticsGreat attention to detailI was in from out of town and needed a brace for my knee. I took my scrip in from my doctor and they fitted me promptly and took care of all the paper work.
5	I am so excited that I found See The Trainer Sports Medicine Store. Being an ATC, I always need medical supplies for sports coverage and taking care of sports injuries in my business. Before See The Trainer, I had to order supplies online and wait for the shipping of the supplies, but now I can just drive a couple miles down the road and they have everything I need. Scott and his staff are wonderful people and very helpful! Prices are great too! I refer patients to the store quite often now! Love the ability to do this. Highly recommend Scott and See The Trainer to anyone needing ANYTHING to take care of an injury!!!
5	Super helpful and so many options for various needs. I found a compression shoulder ice pack for my son and sent my husband back for a back brace. Definitely go!
