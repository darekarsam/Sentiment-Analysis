5	My work schedule is unpredictable, so it was a nice surprise to find the Paradise Valley Mall location open on Sunday. Dr. Kozlowski was very thorough and after the exam, I met with two of the opticians on duty that day. I ended up getting the works--no line bifocals, non-glare polycarboate high definition lenses in both regular and sun glasses. Visionworks has a wide selection of styles and prices, which is why I highly recommend them. Plus, Scott was fun to talk to, which made the experience even better.
5	Amazing customer service!
1	Way way over priced. Customer service was lacking as well!  Doctor was  great but quoted me a completely inaccurate price for contacts! It went from 30 a month to 108? The glasses we were quoted were $700 plus!! There's a place called lesco were you can get a complete pair for between $70-129. The $129 is for the expensive progressive lenses. Great place to get an eye exam but not so good for glasses!!!
5	I 1st walked into Visionworks 8 months ago. After I picked up my prescription glasses and tried them on I could not see better and I got headaches. I then decided to go to nationwide and my prescription came out to 20/20 and it was totally different than vision works (unable to get my vision 20/20..?? So I contacted vision works explained  the situation and they stood by there mistake and re did my glasses. I now see perfect!!! 100% Thank You Visionworks!! I will recommend to friends and family 100%! I also want to thank Shelly, Rick, Rebecca, and Scott. All big help from all!!
