5	5 Star Auto repair earns every bit of their name...5 stars to these guys...they are honest and trustworthy and will always have my business. They fixed my car when even the Chrysler dealership couldn't figure it out! Thumbs way up. Thanks you guys!
5	Honest mechanics, they have the equipment to properly test emmisions for older vehicles. Helped troubleshoot the issues that were keeping me from passing my smog test.
5	I brought my 1969 Olds Cutlass here to get a tune up after I bought it off my grandfather, who had it for 20 years, 47k original miles.  It was dieseling when I turned it off and a little off all around.  When I got my baby back, she ran like a brand new car.  The best part of the whole experience was really feeling like the people I interacted with cared as much about my car as much as I did.  All in all it was a great experience.
5	My buddy and I were in Vegas on business and had a leak going on in the truck. We were on a tight schedule and the mechanic took us in quickly and even gave us a short car ride down the road in his personal car. When we got back, the truck was on the lift and they were checking things out. After a few minutes, the truck was truck down. The level of professional service was outstanding and I will definitely return when I'm in the area and need car help.
5	Do you have a classic car?  Do you love your car?  If so then you need to take it over to Bobby at 5 star.  The attention to detail is unsurpassed.  The prices are fair and competitive.
