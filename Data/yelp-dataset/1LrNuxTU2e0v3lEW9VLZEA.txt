3	Located in PNC Park's Smorgasburgh, Beers of the Burgh serves beers from all over the world with a focus on craft beers from Pittsburgh (including breweries such as Penn Brewing Co. and Church Brew Works). The craft beers on tap are actually some of the cheaper options here priced at $9 for a domestic craft; however, this price is twice the price of these respective drafts outside of the stadium. The selection on tap is seasonal. Unfortunately, I had a little trouble making a choice because I could not find a menu or list of all the beers available as drafts, so I walked around the counter to survey the taps before settling on a Penn Oktoberfest.

Expect some ridiculous, far out pricing for not wanting the watered down, luke warm Coors light that the crazy "Beer Here" guys bring around. Get this, a soft Pretzel and Sam Adams came to 12.75!!! ACK! oh the price you pay for being a Bucco Fan.
5	As of May 2014 a pint of craft beer runs $9.25 at this stand. I'm from Washington DC so this seems par for the course to me, but I guess if you live in Pittsburgh where everything is dirt cheap, the sticker shock can be depressing.Anyway, I was blown away by this beer stand. Probably a dozen or more excellent quality craft beers on draft here. And when I went the line was non-existent. Awesome. If a beer lover comes here and can't find something they like then they're just a big whiner. It is still a ballgame, after all. I'd definitely stop here before and during every game at PNC Park.
