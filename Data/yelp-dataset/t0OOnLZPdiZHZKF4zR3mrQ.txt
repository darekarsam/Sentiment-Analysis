4	Once I discovered Coiffure Pierre, I never went to another barber shop while I lived in Montreal. They had a great student rate ($13, and they didn't even ask if I was a student--or maybe it was obvious). I always got a great cut, which lasted as long as two months. Hey, I put off haircuts a lot.The attention to detail was likely a factor: they would always go around the ears and neck with a straight razor and hot shaving cream. And when  getting a cut in December, they'd even give you a shot of schnapps.Coiffure Pierre used to be further south a few years ago (near Bleury and St. Catherine), but they moved to this location on Sherbrooke, which is in a nicer building. It was also nearer to me and other people living in the McGill ghetto.

1	I saw the reviews and checked it out. Asked for a simple mohawk and got a fucked up buzz cut that looked like a shredded cocnut.  When i try to explain to her, all she told me was "i know what you mean but i cant do anything". It was just awkward and hideous. Waste of 17 dollars. Had to fix my hair by myself when i got home. Will only go back if she paid me
