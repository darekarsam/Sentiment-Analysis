3	I wasn't impressed but it's alright for fast food.. Plus it's something different than MacDonald's or Tim Horton's....
1	Rude service. Food below average. Was ignored for  5 minutes.  Ordered green curry tofu to go.  It had curry flavor, but was dry and tasteless.
1	Watch out, and maybe avoid. The cashier lady *will* yell or raise her voice at you if you so much as make a misstep ordering. By that I mean that you need to know you want "Stir Fry, w/x-flavoring", speak really clearly or else she'll snap at you. I almost walked out.(Doesn't matter if you're speaking French or English, this will happen. Wonder what Concordia students think...)
4	This place is super close to school so that's a plus :) They don't ask you how spicy you want your food, but the shrimp pad Thai is always yummy and I recently tried the Thai style shrimp fried rice which was also good. The chef guys who make your food know what they are doing but the ladies who take your order could definitely use some social skills... Overall the taste is good and you get a good amount of food on your plate for not that pricey and there's a wide variety of choices. The place is always clean and there's a lot of seating available, I also like being able to watch my food being made in front of me :)
