5	Best place! Great service and selection. Also, very competitive and after much of comparison shopping I was back! Linas was very friendly and knowledgeable. He is very passionate for what he does and I saw him taking care of customers. Definitely coming back!
5	I was given a watch for Christmas and needed the band adjusted. I pass this place everyday on my way to work and decided to stop in. I was blown away... excellent service, great prices. While working on my watch I asked about a ring I was wearing that was too big, they gave me a few options and ended up sizing the ring that day. I also asked about a broken watch I was told couldn't be repaired and they said bring it by and they would look... I have a feeling they will be able to fix what the person who broke it couldn't. I have been recommending Pavel's to people at work as well as friends. You get that nice family feel that you don't get at box stores and they had a nice selection and variety of jewelry.
