5	I highly recommend specialized flooring. We went to several stores around Phoenix including Costco and their prices did not compare. Also the other stores could not get the carpet in for 4 to 6 weeks. Specialized flooring installed my carpet within 10 days. They worked all day to get it installed. It looks and feels beautiful. Please check them out.
5	I met with Mike a few months ago and he helped me choose some flooring for my home.  Their prices are great and because they are in the NW valley it was easy for me to check out their selection at their showroom nearby.  They delivered when they promised and got the job done quickly.  They even took good care of a repair for me while they were onsite.
5	Great company to work with. Installation was quick, on time and craftsmanship perfect. Will be back for other rental property upgrades and my own home. The installers this company has are artists and perfectionists. Totally satisfied. Thanks for a great job Specialized Flooring.
1	I hired this company to install tile in my home.  They neglected to seal the grout (although that was part of the agreement).In addition, they broke the flanges off both toilets and left one toilet in my master bathroom shower (leaving the drain hole open so that toxic fumes could escape).  Their employees brought children to the job site and left my doors open and unlocked on several occasions.The job took one month longer than estimated due to workers not showing up.I have written and called this company in an attempt to resolve my dissatisfaction and have not received one response from them to date.  VERY unprofessional ! ! !
