5	I found this place today quite by accident.The little cutest Boutique, what a find!  They have a whole store of really cute stuff I could have bought so much more so I had to pace myself.  The woman who worked there was really friendly and just kept pulling cute outfits for me.  They also have so much jewelry that you could have multiple choices for each outfit.The owners are restocking quite often, not many of each item so you probably will not run into anyone wearing your outfit in town.I love this place and will be back!
5	So impressed by this store!! Very cute, fun outfits for women.  What SOLD me was their fantastic, large selection of jewelry to accessorize with.  I just stopped in to kill time and left with some really cool rings! Not only do I love my new stuff,  but it was super inexpensive !!  (The young lady working was very sweet too ) Highly recommend this cute shop!
5	Today I discovered kaleidoscope fashion and WOW. I love this boutique it has a little bit of everything jewelry, shoes, scarfs, hair accessories, makeup, and clothes! Everything was neatly color organized which made it easy to find what I needed. The staff was very welcoming and with a smile on there face when I walked in, immediately introduced themselves and gave me my space to look around (cause i hate when sales people hover over you) ,just let me know if i needed something to let them know.  The decor inside was awesome and they even gave me ideas how to store my rings at home ;) I will definitely recommend this to my friends and be back to see what else I can find. They do mix and match deals which is awesome you save and get both things you want. Also when you check out share your email and they give you 25% off your purchase.
