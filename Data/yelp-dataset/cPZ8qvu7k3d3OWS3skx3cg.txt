5	Lizy and her team of professionals are great at making dreams come true. My wife and I had an extremely small window of time to get qualified and approved this last summer and Lizy and her team were able to make everything happen in under 4 weeks. Lizy explained everything to my wife and me and made sure we understood every part of the process. We enjoyed working with her and were glad that we used her for a second time. If you need any sort of financial assistance related to your current home or looking to buy a new home, I would strongly suggest reaching out to Lizy for her assistance.
5	Hands down Lizy and her team are all amazing! My husband and I are first time home buyers and Lizy went out of her way to explain the entire process so we knew exactly what to expect. She never failed to call with new updates, answer all our endless questions and make sure we were comfortable with every step. I would definitely recommend her team to anybody looking for a mortgage broker.
5	Lizy and her team were a referral from my (equally stellar) Realtor, Joe Maggiore at Desert Dimensions Realty in Scottsdale. They're a terrific group of pros who are also incredibly nice people. Lizy was totally available to answer any questions I had, let me know exactly what she needed up front and the team's follow-through was perfect. They have great communication and were always easy to reach. They pushed my financing through in no time at all, saving me the aggravation of having to move to another temporary place before getting settled down again. It couldn't have been easier with Lizy's team. I wish I'd known Lizy when I bought my first house all those years ago, and when refinancing the second. She was definitely the best lender I've ever worked with!
