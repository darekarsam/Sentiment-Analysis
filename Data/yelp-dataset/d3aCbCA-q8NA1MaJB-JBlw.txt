5	I originally came to Body Renewal from a BuyWithMe voucher.  I've been back 3 times since then because my therapist is the by far the best I've ever had. Tony makes you feel very relaxed from the start. Although the studio is quite small, it is decorated & lit in a way to provide a calming & peaceful ambiance to go along with the soft music in the background. Tony is professional and courteous. He takes his time and knew to pay attention to where all my tension was built up without me saying a word. I like that he also used several methods of both massaging & stretching the muscles.  Very relaxing.  I almost want to keep it a secret so he doesn't get too busy for me. Either way, it's worth the wait.
4	This place does an amazing job. I go to a reflexology place every once in a while but those types of places are no where on the same level as this place. Good relaxing atmosphere.
5	Tony does an amazing job. I'm a nurse & he always helps me feel my best for kicking butt at work
