4	This place recently opened in Verdun and I finally got to try it out. First off. Be ready for a small venue. I mean VERY small. Two tables only, and a small bar-looking table with 5 places on it. When the sun is out the terrasse is very nice, but on a rainy day, better to take out. The food was great, ordered a salmon fish n chip and it was delicious, it came with fries and on second thought, should've go with a salad. The greatest thing about this place is their fish selection to go. They take order by the phone for you to pick up and they can try to get some rarer fish if you're willing to wait.
