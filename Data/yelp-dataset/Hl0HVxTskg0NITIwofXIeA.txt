4	I have always enjoyed this foot spa even when it was under previous management. The new owner had a month of may incentive for a $20 hour massage which was worth getting back for!This last most recent visit I had the greatest massage performed by Ping and she is wonderful in everything she does!She is heavy handed which is great in a massage however I am a bit sensitive so I asked that she lighten up a bit with the tight grips. (lol)  Everyone is different so you just let them know how hard or soft you would like your massage and they will accommodate. I am still Amazed at all of the work she provided me in one hour for $20 bucks, I of course tipped her the equal amount of what the massage cost. She was fantastic and really had my body singing in a great way. I dream of that foot massage and can not wait to get my happy ass back their for more body pampering.They do everything and it is included in your hour foot massage, scalp, face, neck, ears, shoulders, back, arms, hands, legs, feet and toes. My body was so relaxed I just about fells asleep however did not want to miss the great sensation of the massage so I stayed awake. You can decline any service and request more of something else, I always pass on the ears thing as the feeling of someone digging in my ears is just not relaxing to me and is rather gross in my opinion. Check it out and request Ping because she is Amazing I promise!
