5	With the coming of Cafe Delhi to Carnegie, we finally started to get some good options for ethnic cuisine. The newest contender is Suzy's Sandwiches & Deli. Not sure how  recently they opened but I noticed them today and, as I was in the mood for a snack, I stopped in. They are in the location of the old E Main Deli and are a little mom and pop Mediterranean joint. I had the pleasure of chatting with the owners a bit and trying a couple of things. I went in just to get a spinach pie (with feta, of course) and left with some hummus, stuffed grape leaves, and baklava. I love Mediterranean food and these folks do it right. The hummus was just the right balance of the chickpeas, tahini, and lemon. I could seriously just sit and eat it with a spoon. The grape leaves were seasoned nicely and not at all super oily like you sometimes encounter. The spinach pie was also quite delicious. I'm a little too full at present to try the baklava that I purchased but I have no doubts that it will also be tasty. I plan on ordering food from there tomorrow night for dinner. I'm thinking I'll try the Kafta and the Baba next. If you're in the area, I heartily recommend trying them out.

5	Just had an amazing lunch here. The food was all homemade including the pita. I ordered the Kafta combo platter and my husband ordered the meat pie combo and we both had a hard time finishing. The hummus was great and the meat was perfectly spiced and cooked. We will definitely going back soon!
