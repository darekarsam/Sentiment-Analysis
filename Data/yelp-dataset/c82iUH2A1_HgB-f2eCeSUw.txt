3	3.5 StarsThis self serve car wash is not different than any others.  They keep the lot clean and the machines always work.  You can't ask for anything else right!  How about a automatic car wash with a dry, they have that too.  I have not had much interactions with the staff so when nothing comes to mind then it wasn't bad.
5	this is the only real car wash I go to the prices are decent and when I do nine washes I get a free regular.this is a really nice place the workers are decent thye get the job done and my car is always nice and clean and very fast service
5	Best deal in the whole valley. $11 and I get a super car wash with pre-scrubbing and towel drying and tire treatment. The guys are very professional and nice. I've spent four times this price for a "detailed" wash that wasn't half as good. Plus, they're environmentally friendly. Love this place!!
4	Great car wash. Good self service area and great automatic area. Automatic wash is a steal at 7 dollars for their nicest wash. It even comes with a pre-soak, pre-hand wash and hand dry. The wash could be a little better though. It missed some of the recessed things.
4	First time here and the service was very good. I did the car wash drive thru and got the middle package. They pre-washed my car and then hand dried it after. For $6.00 my car looked excellent. I got a free cloth to wipe down the inside also. Both employees were smiling and if you go back 9 times you get a free car wash. I'll be going back.
