3	The place is nice and the service is decent, but not overly friendly. The burgers are really good and at least taste like they're made fresh, but they take forever to cook, which is fine in a place like this but just know that before you're going in (ie don't go if you're in a rush).They have more topping options than Harvey's and their toppings are generally fresher, at least from my experiences with South St and with Harvey's. Though, at $4.50 a burger, it's pretty expensive. Worth it if you want a big burger that tastes like you'd barbecue at home, but otherwise, McDonalds is like a 4 minute walk away.
2	Great choice of toppings but bland beef. Loved the spicy relish and wasabi mayo on the Hawaiian burger.
3	My husband and I are a bit on the fence about this place. Things we liked;Toppings (we both had the True North Burger)Aesthetics (cool trays, signage, etc)Buns are greatThe stuff we didn't like:The subway/cafeteria style of making your burger The "special sauce" had no kickThe staff seemed a little lost (I'll forgive this a bit since I assume they're all new)The price was quite excessive for fast foodNo liquor license (which for a regular fast food joint I wouldn't mention, but with their patio and "upscale NY burger joint" vibe it felt like it was needed)So in summery-pretty good over priced burgers in a neat location that is poorly staffed.
4	I went to this place a few months ago with friends. The place looked clean and somewhat trendy, so we all ordered different burgers. I had Hawaiian with guacamole and fries. They were good enough to say that staffs are well-trained. The location is a bit too far from university campuses in Waterloo but, to be honest, all of us enjoyed food and I'd like to come here again to try other toppings.
