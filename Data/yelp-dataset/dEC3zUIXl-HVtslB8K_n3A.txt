4	I literally stumbled upon this storage facility as my first choice was unexpectedly closed (On Silverado Ranch Blvd) However, after meeting the manager (Cassie), touring the facility, etc. I finally determined that I felt this location was a better match! I felt that my 'stuff'' would be safer. That this was a manager that truly cared about the facility and the clients. Which can be rare in this world.
5	This location is tucked away on a side street and is clean and I feel comfortable and safe every time I am there to checkout my storage unit. My questions were always answered and I was given a free truck to move my stuff into the unit which was awesome and convenient.Namiah helped me out and is a tremendous asset to storage direct because he was pleasant, kind and courteous to me when I was inquiring about renting a unit and even after I became a tenant.
4	I live right next door to these units. So when it was time to move in with the bf, renting here was a no brainer. We walked in, toured the location and saw my unit I was renting. I was only going to store a few things so we got a 7x10 unit, 3 months for $172. The employees are very friendly and the complex is clean. There is a required gate code entering and exiting the premise so I feel secure storing my items here. Here are a few tips: 1. New tenants can use their moving truck for free to move in (up to 25 miles). 2. They require renters insurance, either your own or you can purchase it from them. 3. Even though your things are in storage, don't forget to cover things up. It still gets dusty.
