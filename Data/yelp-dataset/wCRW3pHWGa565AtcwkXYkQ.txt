4	Loved, loved, loved this restaurant!I dined here with two girlfriends last week and after looking at several other restaurants in the area we decided on this one (also because their logo is so cute with a donkey with a chefs hat on).I had the scallops, which were 4 (yes 4, not the usual 3 you get elsewhere) plump scallops sitting on a bed of smashed potatoes and olives. Absolutely delicious, some of the best scallops i've had in recent years. My friends lamb shank was as she said "Shank-o-licious" and my other friends seafood linguine was also very good.Environment and service was very very good. If I lived in Montreal, this would be one of my favourite restaurants.
4	I went there last Friday with a friend of mine and we eated really well. It's been like 4-5 years the establishment has been open and they serve some french bistro classics. I went for the 3 courses services. Potage which felt like a Potage Parmentier and Ris de veau as a second course. This was definetly the best Ris de veau I ever had. It's not like I get to eat ris de veau each day and it's not something that's really popular but the taste, the texture is awesome. Finally, I had pintade (guinea fowl) with mashed panet.  Simple, efficient menu. Good service and simple but ok wine menu.Best feature would be:Good French classicNot expensive (around 40-50$ per person)
4	Been there twice now. The food was good and the menu is interesting. It's small and has a nice patio. Had a nice gaspacho on a hot night and this time had the 3 course menu for $26. Perfectly sized for 3 courses and food was served nice and hot.
