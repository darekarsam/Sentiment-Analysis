5	Perry is the best German car mechanic in the west...    He was able to take my 1990 bmw convertible and not only get it running but it drives like new...   My car had been sitting for 3 to 4 years.....   I brought it to Perry at Totally German and 4 days later I drove the car out of the shop and it felt like the day I left the dealer 22 years ago...   I had neglected the car and it sat in my Aunts back year for almost 4 years...   I would not bring my car to anyone else....   Volkswagon Passat and Audi certified.    Why pay for the dealer when you can get personal and accurate service right here in Mesa...   Dont pay the dealer prices... Come to Totally German...
5	Best auto repair for German vehicles.. Honest and reliable. You can't go wrong with Perry!
5	These guys are awesome. I went in for a few surface repairs and they didn't even charge me. Super friendly and honest, which is really hard to come by. Wish I had found them sooner so I could have had all my car troubles taken care of there.
