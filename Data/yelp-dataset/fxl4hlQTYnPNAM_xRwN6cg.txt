5	Love love love this place... CEWC is a great place to worship!! This is definitely a spirit-filled church. There is a feeling of love and family when you come in... Pastor Conner delivers the Word in a way that is understandable and practical while also bringing humor and entertainment. If your looking for a church based on the Truth then this is the place to be... See you at the Embassy!!
