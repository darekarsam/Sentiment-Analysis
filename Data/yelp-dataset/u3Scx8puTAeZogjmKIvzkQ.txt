5	Godiva has got to be one of the coolest vintage stores I've ever been in.Much like my favourites from Glasgow, it's a vintage store with a DIY punk spirit. Rather than price up hand-me-downs or pride themselves on mint condition knee length skirts from the 50s, Godiva does all of the above with an attractive twist. This shop is full of the most unusual reworked clothing I've ever seen. Somehow, they have not only managed to locate old Turtle bedsheets from the 90s, but they have stitched them up and turned them into skirts. Believe it or not, it works. The clever designers in here seem to hand pick two old, worn items that clash so badly they set your teeth on edge but make them look AWESOME! I am not a notable fan of 70s football tops but when they are cut and threaded up into rara skirts, I start to find them more attractive.They have some more modern hoodies and tees towards the front of the shop, some jewellery, and an equal supply of both ladies' and men's vintage towards the rear. But it's the funky reworkings of everything you'd never imagined that get me coming back every time. 100% original and best (I know that is the Irn Bru's slogan but I'm borrowing it for the time being) - if you want really inspired Urban Renewal, do yourself a favour and ditch the blander palate of Urban Outfitters in favour of Godiva.
