2	While sitting in the Elevate Coffee House. The Fish Window Cleaning Company came by to clean the windows. They seemed to do a good job, even going back over the window with a rag to get any smudges. However, the main reason I'm writing this review was the guys pants were so low any time I looked outside I was treated to his dollar bill printed boxers, no thanks. He continued to pull them up the entire time he was working. I mean if you go to the effort of putting on a belt please use it. This did not show a professional company, which is a shame because they did a pretty good job cleaning the windows. If I were a business owner here, I would be hesitant to work with this company due to their unprofessionalism.
1	Do not use this company as the owner does not stand behind his word!
2	Hired these guys to clean our windows for my business, they missed two appointments I had made with them. The first seemed like a misunderstanding but we had agreed upon them returning a month later, when the day came they were no were to be seen.
