5	Karla is absolutely the BEST hairdresser in town!  She is personable and attentive while in her chair.  As owner of the salon, she cares about her staff and ensures they are all learning new techniques and styles often.  The salon is ecclectic and fun and always very clean!  And being right beside The Common Market is just an added bonus!!
5	In my 30 years on this planet, I've let under 5 stylists touch my hair. As long as I'm in Charlotte, Karla will be the only one to come close to my hair with a scissors. Not only is she sweet and conversational, she really knows what she's doing. While cutting your hair, she gives you valuable tips and tricks to maintenance, styling, and general information about the characteristics of your hair. Ladies, you know what I mean when I say that you know when it's time for a cut. You hate your hair, nothing looks right, etc. Since switching to Karla, I no longer have that problem. She cuts my hair to make the grow out easy for styling. Weeks after my cut, I still love my hair!What I value equally is the staff that surrounds Karla. All of her stylists that I've met are welcoming and very nice. You walk in to KM & Company and are hit with a positive vibe.I know how hard it can be to switch to a new stylist but believe me when I tell you, you will not be disappointed by Karla and her KM & Company team!
5	Christina is awesome, sweet and chatty is a cute and funny sort of way. She listened to my hair complaints and made suggestions and adapted a hair cut I wanted to accommodate my curly and unruly hair.  During my second visit, she again adjusted my cut as requested.  The hair products are also great.  This is a laid back salon where all the staff are helpful and happy to help you.  Oh I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the adopted bird "Bob", can't forget him,he greets guest as they walk in. :)
