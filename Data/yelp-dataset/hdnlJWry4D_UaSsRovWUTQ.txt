1	The sign on the building says "Now Open" however I just to go in to check it out and the place is NOT OPEN! ugh. What a joke! I've also learned that they will not be having Group Fitness Classes or even Child Care. What the heck??? Is this just going to be a body building gym or what?? Every time I try to get some information out of the staff under the tent that don't seem to know whats going on! How frustrating! If your Looking for group classes like I am this place is not for you!!
2	I javent been to this one but the one in surprise i didnt like. One of the trainers would hit on all the girls which i feel victim to made me feel uncomfortable to workout
1	So now that this place is open I decided to check it out. Not going to lie I was extremely let down for how long this place took to get opened up. All that waiting for just a crappy turn out! First off... Why wouldn't you have kids daycare or most of all even fitness classes??? I was told by Ivan the general manager that I could take classes and leave me kids at the other location ... HAVE YOU SEEN IT??!! I DON'T want to use the old location it's disgusting and I don't ever want to step foot inside it! Best advise I can give is to shop around there are a couple other gyms close by that are nicer with group classes and offer the day care for kids.
1	What a dump! I walk in the guy working the front desk looks at me and walks around the corner. I looked around was not impressed. I'll keep driving to golds !
