3	Feels like its been open for years. It's consistently decent. But avoid 12-12:30, brutally long lunch lineups.
4	Stopped by after a few beers looking for Baconator heaven... Found it!The Baconator is by far the GREATEST fast food burger imaginable. It's so good that I want another one while I write this. This Wendy's location has great drive through and sit down service. It's a big restaurant and there always seems to be a lot of staff. Wait time on this trip from the moment we ordered to my first bacon-beefy bite was less than 2 minutes.
3	Good food, great location, quick service at the drive thru. They usually get it right (though admittedly it should be always...). I'm satisfied.
