4	Ate lunch here a couple of times on a recent trip. Very friendly and efficient service and good fresh Italian standards. Nothing groundbreaking but plenty of choice to enjoy.I had pasta dishes both times - good sized portions, lots of seafood in the sauces. Pasta comes with a simple but fresh salad to start off the meal.
4	Odd as it sounds. Whenever I travel to Karlsrhue I drop in for Italian. food. It is a nice departure from the standard schnitzel and bier.
