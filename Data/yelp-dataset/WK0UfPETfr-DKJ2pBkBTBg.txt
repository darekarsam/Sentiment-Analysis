3	Decent fields. infields aren't super flat so you get some bad hops. the irrigated outfield makes that pretty bumpy too at times in the fall. Playing center field in two of the four fields there's a light that blinds you as it's immediately behind the batter from that angle so it's hard to read the ball coming off.

It's $5 for a large domestic beer or a large glass of wine. The prices are actually really cheap. However, there is usually only 1 person working so the service can be a little slow.The staff is usually very friend and the fields are in good conditions!
