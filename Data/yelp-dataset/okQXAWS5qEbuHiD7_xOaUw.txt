5	Ancient Creations is a phenomenal place to visit at the Venetian. Their collection and historical information blows the mind. I was specifically interested in the Alexander the Great pieces as well the Atocha coins they had. All of it real, all of it legit, and an amazing gem of a store as staff.
4	This store has very unique jewelry based on coins and other ancient artifacts. When you buy a piece here, it is an investment because you are buying a rare archelological item that you might otherwise find in a museum, but if you want a special gift for someone, check this place out. The staff are very knowledge about the historical nature of the items.
5	Very cool spot with an extremely knowledgable owner who will share the extraordinary history of each and every coin they possess should you care to know about them.
5	Such a cool place to visit! Dino was so knowledgeable on every single piece. My husband and I were just browsing and we ended up having a 45 minute conversation with Dino about history. He's so passionate about his business and he left  a heartwarming impression on us. Dino we wish you many more successful years in business!!
