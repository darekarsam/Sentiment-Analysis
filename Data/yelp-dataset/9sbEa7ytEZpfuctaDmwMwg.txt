5	We just love to shop here for the kids and for gifts. It's tough to find a toy store these days with the old family run, boutique feel. Reve d'enfant is a treasure trove of good quality toys that aren't made of suspect plastic, paint that cracks and staff that don't care (unlike the big box stores). It's great to also be able to buy toys that are actually educational and don't require batteries! I honestly don't think we will toy shop anywhere else. We love the Playmobiil products (expensive but high quality), original Thomas the Tank Engine, and especially brands like Lamaze, Ravensburger and ours favs, Melissa & Doug.Hurrah for small family run stores!!
5	Best toy store in the west for educational games. Staff knows their product inside and out.
