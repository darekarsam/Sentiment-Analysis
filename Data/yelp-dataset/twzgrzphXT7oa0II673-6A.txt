3	Alright I'll tell you, but don't go ruining this place bc right now it is very pure. Don't try to order fancy mixed drinks, or food, or in English. Do get a 40oz Labatt50 and the beer card that gets you free 40oz Labatt50 when you've had 10 40oz Labatt 50s. Do take advantage of the always-free jukebox to play some Journey, and do sit on the wide sunny patio and remember how much fun it was to be a teen drinking 40's in the park. Oh and please don't step on my drunk neighbour sitting on the floor, she's a very nice lady.
4	Oh the Terrace at La Petite Idee Fixe. During the cold winter months I have summery dreams of this place: Sitting on the patio, sweaty, drinking big 50s and lazing the afternoon, early evening away chatting with friends. It honestly doesn't get much better than this when it comes to cheap beer and cozy terraces. The winter is a bit of a different story - the Jukebox is free, beer still cheap and there is a pool table. Love.

The patio was great despite the rain because there were lots of covered areas, and table umbrellas. The inside seemed loud and also good, but apparently my group wasn't having that because they all wanted to smoke. Everyone was really friendly. Probably because they were drunk.
