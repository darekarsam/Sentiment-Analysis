4	Container was dropped off when they said it would be ans picked-up as scheduled, what could be better!Everything else is up to you.
1	I did not use this specific agent but rather the company itself is what gives moving companies a bad rap.  Beware if you are moving long distance as Mayflower failed to deliver in the time frame promised and I spent two weeks waiting for furniture which had not even left NYC.  I used Mayflower based on the name recognition and paid a premium; but the rudest, most arrogant customer service I have ever experienced.  I also filed a complaint with the MO BBB.  Why should they care, it isn't like they expect to have repeat business.
1	PLEASE never use MAYFLOWER you will have broken priceless items Missing items how do you loose a washer?? (stolen no doubt) Broken things. Dented bikes. I cant say enough of how bad this service is. Edited.. Thats Mayflower on a run from L.a. to N.C.  Worst ever
