3	I love Starbucks.  The hot chocolate is so dreamy and creamy.  I don't actually like coffee...*ducks for cover*That's right... I don't like coffee!  ...but I do enjoy Starbucks for their chocolate and treats.  You do need to get the treats early in the day though, because they tend to not restock them and they get pretty stale by late afternoon.This particular starbucks in Montreal was in one of the more English speaking areas, and it was pretty obnoxious that the coffee maker couldn't understand the order in English.  I mean... there are 3 options for size... if you work there, you should at least understand what a tall or venti is... the other staff members looked pretty annoyed with him too when continually had to ask what things were.Aside from the large man licking the glass case and motorboating in front of the display of cream cheese brownies.... it was actually an OK place... maybe I just like the free wifi...
3	The baristas are nice and patient, and they serve the orders pretty fast and prepare them nicely. The place is slightly messy on a busy day and none of the staffs actually cleans the table...They somehow used soy milk instead of regular milk for my Frappuccino, it tasted very nice, but it was not what I wanted.
3	C'est bien mais les toillettes...
3	Well.. coffee isn't bad but seats are super uncomfortable and I saw (not only one but at least five!!) flies sitting on foods (breads, etc) in the display case.. I will never buy any food here
3	Nice place and the atmosphere here was okay. As for the baristas, courteous and nice. Service was also okay. In short, everything is pretty much mediocre. Its Starbucks so it was all good in the end.
