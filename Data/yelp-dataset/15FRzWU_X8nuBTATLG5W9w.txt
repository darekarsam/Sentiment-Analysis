4	Beautiful salon with a wonderful owner who made planning a fun Bachelorette celebration really easy and enjoyable. For a reasonable cost per person, we were able to close the salon to just our private party of seven where three stylists got to work while we had champagne and crudite all ready and set up for us to enjoy. (They even decorated with some special Bachelorette signs and balloons).The bride-to-be loved it all and while the degree of everyone's satisfaction with the actual blowouts/styles were all over the spectrum, the overall experience was really nice.
3	I've been here a handful of times. Nice modern and clean salon. Generally had a good experience although some stylists are more talented than others and when you find one you like they don't necessarily work on the days you need them. Employees sometimes lack professionalism. For instance, I was on time for an appointment once and my stylist was 15 min late. Instead of washing my hair while I waited, the girls who were there just talked and did their makeup. When you're in the business of providing 30 min blow-outs maybe learn to multitask/prioritize?
1	Worst blow out of my life. I told the stylist "I have very straight, flat hair, so I just want a little wave, with some volume on top" and ended up with huge curly poofy clown hair. When I told her that wasn't ok, she brushed it out and slicked down my hair with product so the top was flat and oily and the bottom was crazy curly - you know, that style no one has ever requested or wanted? The opposite of what I had asked for? I don't know, at least the place was clean and they were polite - besides charging me to make me look ridiculous.
