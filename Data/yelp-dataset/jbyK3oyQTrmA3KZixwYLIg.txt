5	I drive for an hour from Columbia, SC every six weeks to have Krystal cut my hair. I have been to almost every "upscale" salon in Coumbia, and cannot find anyone that compares.Plain and simple - she gives a great cut!
5	Krystal is by far the most talented stylist I have ever had. I found her close to 3 years ago and have been to countless Aveda's and other "up-scale" salons in numerous states in search of someone of equal talent. Unfortunately for me, I have never found one. When I lived in South Carolina I would drive 2 hours to see her, now that I live in Washington DC, I drive 6 and a half. It doesn't matter if you have short or long hair she always does an outstanding job. Your hair not only looks amazing when you first get it done but, as it grows out, it still looks just as good as the first day when you left the salon.I am a huge fan of Toni and Guy in general. They shutdown their salons weekly to train their stylist on the latest trends and new products from their line. (Personally, I only use Bed Head, S-Factor, and Catwalk products on my hair, all being the Toni and Guy line.)I promise you will never be disappointed!
