5	My friend showed me this place and I thought it would be too pricey for my budget. Turns out it is a bit pricey but I still had enough money to buy stuff!The clothes and accessories... Everything is amazing. It's got a nice feminine touch, but there's still a bit of some "grungy / hipster" clothes (which I wouldn't really wear). The stuff there is realllly good quality! You have to check out the bags, shoes, and accessories! They are to die for. (Although there was the same pair of shoe there that was in the Boutique 1861 too, which is kind of its sister shop next door.) It's really neat and organized, the clothes are in the front, the bags and shoes in the right corner and the sales at the left corner. The fitting rooms are behind all that. The store in its "design" is really nice and there's lots of space. The girl that worked there that showed me around was really nice! She's friendly and didn't push me to buy anything or follow me around the store, which was a relief for once. Extra points for the store - they give 10% discount to students all year long!
5	During my visit to Montreal, I remember walking past this store and thinking: "I'll bet everything in that store is crazy espensive." It's organization impecable, the lay out of clothes and shoes with just the perfect lighting was something akin to a museum, but because it was so alluring I had to go in and see what kind of prices they were asking for. It was to my great surprise to find that it was actually very affordable, and top that the very friendly cashier told us everything in the store was 50% off... Well! That settles that! I had to buy something!Ended up purchasing some very cute flats for work, the design unique while the shoe is comfortable. Stop by here if you're ever in Montreal; definitely worth it.
