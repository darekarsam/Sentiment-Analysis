5	I have eaten here for the last 10 years. Once again I am working in the downtown area and there are quite a few Mexican restaurants near me but I will always drive down to South Phoenix to grab food from here. In 10 years the food has not changed. It is the same great Carne Asada Taco's and Burrito's I have enjoyed over and over.While living in Texas I would come back to Phoenix to visit and this was always on the list of places I had to go. Breakfast Lunch or Dinner this restaurant can serve up some of the best food in town.
5	Had the Carne Asada burrito, it was fresh and delicious!! Plus watched novellas and hot women on Univision :) great quick spot for lunch for downtowners that want good Mexican food.
3	Wasn't really impressed by the food, sad to say. I was really looking forward to this place being good but nothing had flavor for me. I order the grilled shrimp, very bland and still had the shell in! I'm mean that's cool and all for the look but when ur fighting with the shell to take out the good part that's a big negative for me. The beans and rice were okay, I tried some of my girlfirends tacos.. I couldn't even tell you what it was cuz the flavor was just nothing exciting for me. Would I come back probably not, would i recommend this place to people i know, most likely not.. Not to post this to steer you away but like I said I wasn't impressed much. The best tasting thing was the fountain drink COKE.
5	Tacos are great. The beans have a really good taste. The rice tastes homemade. Price is cheap.
