5	The sexiest European, intimate but friendly, I a southern way, lounge, with a New York sophistication atmosphere.Here is here you go to relax with your friends.Tell Amir or Al that Downtown Dan sent you.
4	Decided to visit based on a friend promoting.  Glad I went, very much a lounge type scene where you have bar (good drinks) and a lounge area for seating.  There was a local band there this particular night and the crowd seemed very mature.  I will be visiting again.
5	This cool cozy place is warmed up with orange walls and and original artwork that is available for purchase. Most recently, I was here for a private event and it was just as lovely as previous "open to the public" evenings that feature jazz and beverages. Great place to lounge (with friends or a date).Public Service Announcement: There is street parking (meters) and a lot across the street. Don't park behind Kanvas, as they will tow you without hesitation.
1	Cool place, neat, clean, nice art work... HOWEVER the tipsy bartender creeped out many of the girls with us, then overcharged us for our drinks. Come to find out, my bank statement read they charged us twice for the amount total with tip... then refunded one of the charges without the tip. Very smooth way to rip people off .. Definitely not going back.
4	Kanvas is a nice cozy bar where you receive an intimate private experience the drinks are good and the art is cool along with rest of the decor I would definitely recommend this for a cozy gathering of friends ...
