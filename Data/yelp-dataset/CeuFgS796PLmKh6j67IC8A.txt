5	Russ is awesome.  We had a great time!   Our 4 year old did great on the horse thanks to Russ.   We showed up unannounced and he still took great care of us.Definitely recommend!
5	Russ was a great trail guide! The trail ride was beautiful, and such a fun time.  The views of all the Saguaros were amazing.  Highly recommend!
5	Russ and his family of wonderful horses helped me to have a fantastic three-hour ride on December 2.  It was raining when we first started, and Russ offered to let me out of our appointed ride, but I was game and, thankfully, Russ and his horses were as well.  It was an amazing ride through a pristine forest in Maricopa County.  Just amazing vistas and it was so pleasurable to be on such a well-trained horse.  Thank you Russ and Royal!  You made my day.
