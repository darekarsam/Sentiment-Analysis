5	Just a short note to say thank you Clayton for the amazing customer service and great job you did fixing my home AC unit! This was a much easier process that I thought it was going to be. Thank you very much and I will recommend your services in the future.
5	I was referred to Aire Serv of Red Mountain to have an HVAC inspected on a house I am purchasing.  Clayton came right out for the inspection and found that another air conditioner company had installed a brand new unit but it was too large for the house and the duct work was leaking so it was not  running efficiently.   Clayton came back a second time to meet with the original installer who agreed that the unit needed to be switched out to the right size unit and all the issues corrected.  He went above and beyond to make sure all the problems were corrected, thank you Clayton!  I feel confident in referring Aire Serv of Red Mountain to all my friends and family.
