3	I visited the lobster stand, and had the lobster roll. Two rolls made for a tasty but rather expensive treat. A few bites and the rolls were a pleasant memory but I was still hungry.
3	I was really excited to check out the Muvbox in Montreal.  Drove all the way from Toronto to check it out :)  The concept is super cool.  I tried the Porchetta sandwich with the spicy pesto sauce.  I also had the fennel slaw.  The sandwich was spicy and good but very small.  The slaw lacked flavour but it was nice to offset the spicy sandwich.  My husband had the lobster roll and clam chowder soup at the other Muvbox and it was good but very expensive!   YOu definitely don't get your money's worth but the concept is totally cool.
4	Situated in Old Montreal near the waterfront is MUVBOX Porchetta. Environmentally friendly, Recyclable & sustainable materials, solar power, local products and eco-friendly efficiencies, all are key ingredients of the MUVBOX brand. They just do 1 kinda sandwich here. The Porchetta sandwich. Porchetta is mainly pork marinated in garlic, rosemary, herbs and traditionally roasted on wood. The ingredients here are fresh and the sandwich tastes good. But it misses a key ingredient & thats where they lost a star . The crackling. No Porchetta sandwich is complete without the crackling. They also do two kinda salads. Pop is served in glass bottles. And they take cards.Food : Good, Not greatService :FastAmbiance : Near the waterfrontWorth the price : Yes
