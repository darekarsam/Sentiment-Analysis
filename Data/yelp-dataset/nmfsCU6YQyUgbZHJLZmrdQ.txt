5	Dr John has been a lifesaver for me.  I have a job that keeps me in need of a chiropractor.  I have walked in in significant pain and walked out pain free.  I have gone to several chiropractors in the last few years and he is by far the best.  He has the latest technology to help him make smart adjustments and monitor  progress.  He takes his time and makes adjustments based on your individual problems, not just the in and out same for everyone back cracking that I have had elsewhere.  Top notch doctor.  Thanks, Dr John!
5	He is a miracle worker!
