I admit to having made fun of the idea of a Ping Pong Club with only one ping pong table, and I do still think that's blatantly goofy, but now I find it endearing. The staff are super nice and easy going, and the room is good looking: booths and long communal tables, white and wood, ping pong table, plus baby foot and air hockey and a dj. There are a couple TVs and a big projector screen which makes it a great place to watch hockey even though it doesn't feel like a sports bar, and the giant mugs of beer help too. I had some of a big basket of fries that were crispy and tasty, and my friends ordered the veggie lasagne and really liked it. There's a lot going on here but instead of feeling like it's trying too hard it just feels like someone with a sense of humour made a list of their favourite things and opened the kind of bar they would like to spend time at, and it works, and it fits the neighbourhood way better than I was expecting. I'll be back for sure.

So while this isn't exactly a "Ping Pong Club", more like a "Ping Pong if you're lucky/ practice your sharing skills" it is a welcomed addition to Mile End and the first of its kind that I hope sticks around for a while (or expands). Cocktails are good, most are $10, and there are milkshakes and snacks. The vibes are relaxed super great for a date whether its your first or one of many with your lover. Music spanned MGMT to Beatles to U2 (I know, you couldn't escape him from iTunes and now this... We won't hold it against them this time). Have some fun, get pinging and ponging.
2	Good place if you like under-cooked (not-cooked) raw burgers - dangerous combination with drunk hungry people. Aside from that OK place with ping pong and foosball table. Nice service and music as well.
