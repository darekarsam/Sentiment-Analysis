4	We celebrated the start of patio season by wandering over to Grill N Go near Papineau & Fleury in Ahuntsic. The food was really delicious. We had the 1/4 chicken and 1/2 ribs special because the "lunchbox" servings sounded too big in our heads. We were expecting Ramados-size servings, I guess. Next time we'll go with the lunchboxes because what we had wasn't a lot of food. Oh, well, that left room for ice cream afterward.The atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired. You're basically sitting out on the sidewalk, which we knew ahead of time. However, music with every second word a swear word isn't really appropriate for a public place with kids around...or adults for that matter, IMHO. Like the reviewers in French said, you may wish to do take-out or delivery and enjoy your food at home in a more pleasant atmosphere.Really 3 1/2 stars but I'll round up because their selection of salads and other accompaniments is so interesting.
4	Cool atmosphere with rap music playing which is fine by me. Ordered ribs. Ribs are not that big for the duo sides. One had lots of fat so really had one beef rib split among two which actually worked since we were not that hungry but for others might be a concern. Had a Grill n go salad which was tasty and fries which the portion is huge.
