1	HORRIBLE Customer Service!!!!! Carolyn and Nancy are inable to fix issues yet they want to refer you again! I got promises and nothing was ever adjusted---just another "We're Sorry"...yadda yadda Save yourself!!!!!! GO ELSEWHERE!!!!!!!
5	We moved to Surprise ( New Home ) in 2003 and started doing business with Bill Johnson State Farm in 2005.  I practically know everyone in the office.  They are nice, friendly and knowledgeable.Bill Johnson and his staff have taken great care of us and been there for us when we needed them.  We eventually moved out of Surprise and back into Phoenix ( ASU West Area).  I bring this up because we could have switched to another agent way closer to home.However, that never crossed our mind.  State Farm has our business and protects us with Auto, Life, and Home Policies and even services ( State Farm Bank ) our car note.Like A Good Neighbor State Farm Is There !
