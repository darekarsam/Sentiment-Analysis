2	I love this chain.   Not this store.    2 people staffed on a Saturday during lunch isn't enough. The staff was more interested in arguing about how to charge me for my sandwich than making it.Kept pushing me to have my sandwich Mike's Way.   My name is not Mike and I want it my way.  Here is a hint.   Use only enough oil to make the sandwich moist.   I am not trying to lube a car.  Train the staff better and teach them some manners please.
2	I love jersey mikes but today this place had brown lettuce and very poorly trained staff....avoid this one
5	10 out of 5 stars! Store is always clean and staff is very friendly. Couldn't ask for better service!
5	i love this chain, and this location espically! friendly staff and the manager working today (monday) at 10:30 was extremely helpful when it came to suggesting a new sandwhich for me to try. this is my favorite location in all of arizona! great job guys!!!
4	So I have to give this review an update. The owner contacted me and invited me to try this location again. They had made a management change and I was to ask for the new manager when I got there. I thought what the heck everyone deserves a second chance. The new manager, Lawrence, is super friendly and gave me great service. The vegetables are fresh again and the sandwiches are back to Jersey Mikes standards. What a difference from just a month ago. So if you have previously tried this location and were unhappy i say try it again and you will be happy you did. Thank you Duane and Lawrence for the great service! Jersey Mikes is back in my lunch rotation!
5	Every time  I come in to this place I feel welcomed! They have great customer service and the food is always on point. Thanks guys.
5	Came in today, and i haven't been to a jersey Mike's in forever. Had a terrible customer service experience at a car dealership before getting lunch, the staff here was super friendly and helped turn my mood around. They even gave a free cookie.
