4	I stopped into Urban Cottage after passing it early mornings while walking my dog. It's right across from the cemetery so it has a unique location set off by itself and there is parking right outside which is nice. I really enjoy small shops like this where you get a nice curated experience of different things the store owner thinks people would like. They have an interesting selection of home decor/accessories as well as a some jewelry, cards, and vintage pieces. I've been in a few times now and they are constantly updating their inventory so it is fun to stop in and see what new things they are offering.I'm a big fan and excited to see how things progress with this store in the new year. I will certainly be back!

5	it's my fifth visit to wonderful Pittsburgh and the city never fails to impress me. Urban Cottage is a shoppe with great gifts for nearly any budget. I loved some of the paintings on the reclaimed wood. Whether you're looking for a housewarming gift, birthday gift or a "just because" gift, you really can't beat this place if you're in PGH! We need one of these in CLEVELAND!! :)
5	I love stopping here on my way home. Great for hostess gifts or something special for my home. There's always something new to see and Linda has great ideas for different occasions and spaces.
