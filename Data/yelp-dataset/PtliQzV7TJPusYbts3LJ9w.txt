4	What can I say about Copoli burgers? Well for one, they're so big that they come in a small pizza box. Like pizza, they're also cut into slices. However, unlike pizza, you don't regret the decision minutes after your last slice. Oh yeah, and they're very reasonably priced. Besides the fries (which are amazing), I honestly haven't tried anything but their burgers, but it wouldn't surprise me if the rest of the menu is mind-blowingly delicious. A pleasant addition to Mont-Royal East, but probably to the detriment of Mange Moi.
4	One of the best unique burgers I have ever tasted. If you are looking for something different than the generic 'Hamburger' from Five Guys or La Belle Province, Copoli is the perfect place for you.They serve delicious and huge "8-inch" burgers with very tasty seasoned beef patty. Everything from the burger to the fries is cooked to order making the food really hot and fresh. I never tried the rest of the menu but I bet everything is as good as the burgers and there's definitely something for all tastes: sandwiches, subs, salads, poutines, etc. Next time you are on Mont-Royal St. and looking for one of the best unique burgers
2	The burgers are good but their delivery policy seems to change from day to day. After placing my usual order over the phone (two bacon cheeseburgers), they called me back to say that, in order for them to deliver to my neighbourhood, the order had to be $20 before tax (not the policy last time I got food delivered from them, but whatever). Fine, I'm $2.50 short. To meet the $20 minimum, I tell her to add a small order of fries (which I do not want, seeing as the burgers are already big and their fries are not the best, especially after they have been delivered). She then says I have to order two trios for $23.50 or they won't deliver. Uh, no. Get it together people. I ordered from Boustan instead.
