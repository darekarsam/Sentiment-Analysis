5	We have been using Epic Web Solutions for about 3 years now to do our SEO, and help manage our website.  In addition to that they have built several other websites over the years geared toward lead generation and recruiting.  Right now, we are ranking #1 on google under the criteria we want I give all the credit to Nick Julia and his team at Epic Web Solutions.  I would highly recommend Epic Web to anyone looking to build or optimize their website.
5	I've been working with Epic Web Solutions for about 1 year, initially for some on-page SEO work and some minor website edits - and I am currently transferring all of our IT needs over to them - including hosting. What really impresses me about Epic Web Solutions is they clearly love what they do. My point of contact Scott is extremely intelligent, hard working, and he loves what he does. I'm not particularly skilled with IT, but they do a great job of explaining things and implementing ideas. Always enjoy working with them - would highly recommend them for any website work or general IT needs.
5	I had the pleasure of working with Epic Web Solutions with my previous employer for several years and when I switched to my new company I highly recommended them- we started using them just a week or so ago and we have gotten more accomplished in this week that we have in months. A new email platform was successfully rolled out helping the company run much smoother. Their customer service and attention to detail are out of this world, and they get things done! I highly recommend these guys, I can't say enough great things about them. Next we will be hiring them for our SEO and online marketing management. I can't wait to see what they can do for us!
