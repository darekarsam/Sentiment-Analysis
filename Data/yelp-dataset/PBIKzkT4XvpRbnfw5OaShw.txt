5	Veronica used 15 vials but made it painless. So glad I picked this location. Fast friendly front desk service in and out in 1hr15 with no appt!
1	GOLD in RUDENESS. it was my first time and only time going to this location. Whole staff was very rude, confrontational, and very short. I felt like the 3 women at the front desk and the rotating nurse hated there jobs, and its very noticeable. There were about 7 of us in the lobby and 5 were senior citizens. bullying them with there comments and while they explain they would just cut them off  "ok, ok I got it"If you don't like to do customer service find a back office job. were paying clients that deserve to be respected.
1	Just don't go!  You'll not only be saving yourself aggravation, you'll be making a statement that as a consumer of health care services, you're not willing to put up with less than professional behavior.  I can't think of a time in a health care facility of any sort when I've been treated with less regard.  The staff at the front desk is thoroughly without empathy, and completely lacking in professional demeanor.  That is to say, abrupt and bossy.  One of them would only tell me to sign in and just wait...wouldn't even let me get a question in, while another at the front desk sat there and stared daggers at me, with an expression that I was something she had scraped off her shoe.   I get it, Quest, it's about money and keeping labor costs down by hiring at the low end..  I will tell every doctor I know, and friends to avoid Quest whenever possible.
