5	I am soooooo happy that this new location has opened!!!! I have been a huge fan of Juice N Go for ages. I used to live close to the Rainbow Location and ate there all the time. A large acai bowl with extra granola with all the fixings is the perfect meal. Healthy and filling with a sweet tooth pleasing sweetness. I moved to the centennial area a year ago and have not been able to enjoy the bowls and quesadillas as much as I would like. Once this spot opened up, i was happier than a kid at Disneyland. Thank you Juice n go crew for all that you do and for giving us a healthier option when it comes to food.
5	I wish I found this amazing delicious healhy place sooner! Im 35 weeks pregnant and just found my new favorite sweet fix...and its super healthy!
