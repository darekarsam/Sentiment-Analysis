4	La Pendulerie defies categorizing; I go mainly for the homemade fudgesicles; they come in milk & dark chocolate - Yum! It's really hard waiting the minute or two for them to warm a kiss to allow for the max in flavor.La Pendulerie sells clocks, Swiss Army knives, watches, Swiss chocolate, and other Swiss foodstuffs. If memory serves the make/sell 54+ flavors of hot chocolate or chocolate milkshakes. This past F1 I noted the had a sign that they sell hotdogs (misnomer); they are actually sausage sandwiches at a reasonable price.I've also very much enjoyed all the chocolate I've eaten there.This establishment enriches the Montreal landscape by its existence. Long live La Pendulerie!
3	This place is an odd mix of a sandwich shop, chocolatier, and clock maker, all rolled into one! Quite quirky, considering that patrons can be quite baffled, not knowing what to expect. However strange, the owners are very nice and quite friendly.The clocks are quite expensive, but they seem to be worth the workmanship. Their hot chocolate is alright, but their sandwiches are great (especially for the price and selection). The chocolate selection is 'run of the mill' with a few items not normally found in stores.
