1	Few Chinese-American resturaunts get it wrong. These guys did.I decided to get some Chinese food delivered to my house for lunch and couldn't find any place that would do it before 4:00 PM. However, this place would. Looking back, I wish I had ordered at 4:00 because I didn't get my food for at least 45 minutes to an hour.I ordered some Orange Chicken, fried rice, and an egg roll. The egg roll was okay, it's really hard to make a deep-fried roll of lettuce taste bad. The real problem was the Orange Chicken and fried rice. The chicken was served as long "strips" that were dipped in some kind of hush puppy batter and was most likely baked. The orange sauce was bland and didn't taste very orange-y at all.The fried rice came in a very small container and held the consistency of cookie dough. There was no evidence that the rice had really been fried and had no other ingredients in it other than rice and maybe some egg. My chopsticks remain upright when I stick them into the bowl. The consistency alone was enough to turn me off to this rice. It tasted somewhat okay, but not good enough to make up for its awful pasty demeanor.From my experience, I would never order from this place again and would not suggest anyone else order from this place either.What an extremely disappointing lunch....
