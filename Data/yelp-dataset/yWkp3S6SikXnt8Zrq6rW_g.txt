5	Had lash extensions for the first time and couldn't be more pleased! Adrianna did an amazing job. Very relaxing environment and everyone was so nice!!!!! Just have to remember to bring audio book or podcast next time.... They look so natural, only regret  is that I didn't do this sooner, would have saved a fortune on mascara!
5	Just had my full set of dramatic silk eyelashes done! Love it! Love it! Love it! Destiny was absolutely amazing! Very clean spa. Super friendly and helpful staff. Definitely coming back and recommending Lash Out Spa to my friends.
