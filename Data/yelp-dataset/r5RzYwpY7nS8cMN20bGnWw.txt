4	The ice cream tastes really good but the customer service was not all there.
5	There is no better ice-cream shop in this part of NC.Key Lime Pie in a homemade wafflecone is the best.Cotton Candy Explosion...only have them make it into a milkshake and suck up those Pop Rocks through the straw. A Brownie Sundae that will rest in the pit of your stomach for hours.(That might not be a good thing, but at least it tasted good on the way down.)Dicey parking lot and drive-thru just because you worry about running over a customer that's walking up to the store.I only wish someone would market a frozen Key Lime Pie slice on a stick dipped in Chocolate. I had one in Key West and it was the best thing I have ever had. It costs about $125 to have a dozen shipped to NC because of, well, being frozen, incasing them in dry-ice, and shipping overnight..Your pal,Walter
5	Can't get much better than this! Ice cream is at perfect temperature for scooping up and eating, so it melts faster than hard frozen stuff.
