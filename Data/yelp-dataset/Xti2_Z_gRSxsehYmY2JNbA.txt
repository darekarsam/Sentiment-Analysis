3	I get my dry cleaning done here primarily because it's convenient and secondarily because of the service. I've brought in clothes and bedding, and they've never messed anything up. It seems expensive (I'm sure I could get men's shirts done cheaper elsewhere), but the location can't be beat.
5	I can't give lord Duncan's anything less than 5 stars. They are truly royal. I will never go to another dry cleaners and I feel so at home when I walk through the doors. #LD
4	They do a good job, price is a little high.  Nice people, and loyal to clients!
