4	This is a cheap motel, but my experience with it was very good, for what it was.  The room for one person was just under $45 / night, including tax.  It was small, but had everything you need (A/C).  Wireless internet was $3, and although it wasn't terribly fast, it was very reliable.  This motel is very minimal; there's no real lobby, just a small office in front where you check in and out.I had a corner room next to the stairs, and yet I had no trouble with noise at night: it was very quiet.  The bed was comfortable enough, and the air conditioner worked well enough.  The room had a lot of cosmetic wear and tear, loose towel rack, missing top to the toilet.  However, the stuff that really matters most was in top condition: the shower worked great, and the a/c temperature control kept the room at a very consistent temperature.  And to boot, the tap water was drinkable.I would stay here again, if I ever stay in or around Tempe/Phoenix again, which is doubtful, since I found Phoenix to be the most abysmal city I have ever visited.

1	Absolutely horrible. We booked a room last night, got in there and there was NO heat. I called the front desk, and the snippy concierge told me that, nope, there's no heat in the rooms because we're in Arizona. It's been getting down to the 20s every night! She says, "I can give you some extra blankets". We gtfo ASAP, got our refund, and went to the Super 8.
