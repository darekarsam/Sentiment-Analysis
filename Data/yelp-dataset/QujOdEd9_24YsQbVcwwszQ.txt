3	Apparently, this place in the University of Phoenix building is brand new or just reopened, so going to break it in with a Yelp review.  Looks clean, with a somewhat smallish selection of cafeteria-type foods.  Friendly service.  I opted for the flatbread pizza.  They top the pizza, and put it in this conveyor-style oven (similar to some toasters I've seen at college cafeterias hotel continental breakfast rooms.)  Quick and fast preparation, very cheap price, mediocre, salty taste.  Drinks are fairly pricy for the amount of soda you get.  Refills are worth almost as much as the full price drink.Not bad.  Good if you work in the building and you forgot lunch at home.  You would do better getting a drink at QT or Circle K on your way in the morning.  They close early on Fridays.

4	The build your own breakfast burrito is a team favorite! The BYO salad and green chili chicken soup are pretty awesome if you're looking to keep it light for lunch. Some menu items are a bit over priced for what you get but overall, it's a convenient meal when there's a lot of work to be done!
4	I like the Bistro for what it is. It is a much better workplace cafe than others that I have experienced.  Bfast burritos are a solid choice. They have Thursday Chef's Table specials that are usually very good. Prices are fair and Gaston, Cindy, and Yadira give great customer service. They should offer bfast pizzas every day, though!
