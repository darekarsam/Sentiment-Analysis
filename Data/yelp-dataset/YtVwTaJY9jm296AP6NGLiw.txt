5	Awesome place and laid back atmosphere.
5	This is a great tattoo shop. The artists are all talented and there is a very relaxed atmosphere. I got my chest piece here and I plan on returning for all my future tattoos. I am more than satisfied with my pieces and I would suggest this shop for anyone that wants any work done.
5	I am extremely pleased with this shop. I used to use this same shop location for previous work years ago before they were bought out and became American Nightmare. Being the only shop location I have ever used, I went back today. I was first surprised that I was even able to get in today since I called last minute. What can I say, this afternoon I just said 'hey, I need some new ink!' and called. I was also taken earlier than my appointment time (I got there early thanks to the lack of traffic). When I walked in, the staff was friendly, I was offered a drink, and the shop was clean. My artist was also very nice and helpful. I brought in a template and he immediately made helpful suggestions to make it better.I was not let down. The detail on this tattoo is amazing. I honestly think this was the best done tattoos that I have ever received. It is also a cover up! Had a passerby not been told that it was a cover up, he said he would not have even known. Price was very reasonable too. I made sure I grabbed a couple cards and will be referring! I am VERY PLEASED. Need some ink, ask for Jason.
