5	I went on a Friday for Reno's Roc n Sol All-Stars JAM. The jam host,  Reno Renaldo Bellamy, was friendly & professional. He greeted me as I walked in & made sure I was signed up to play bass & sing. The house band & jammers were great & supportive. I was not charged for my sodas & the drinks are cheap. The food was excellent. I will be back!
5	Saturday nights are very chill! Live house band at 9 and then a cover jam band comes on about 10:30. Affordable drinks with live entertainment - always a good time. The bartenders are quick and take care of everyone!
5	3rd shift crew is always on point Bryan and Matt always good conversation and always ready to pour another! plus they pay out nicely!
4	Went on a weekday evening for dinner. The place was almost empty except for a few people at the bar area.  The interior of the restaurant was designed with a lodge cabin theme and was cute and comfortable. The food was typical pub food and fairly priced. I ordered a burger with fries which turned out ok, but the bun was way over buttered and greasy. I would recommend asking for any kind of sandwich bread to be lightly buttered. I'm giving this review an extra star than what I think it deserves due to our server Misty - she did a great job!
5	Visited Reno's L.V. ROC N SOL All-Stars-Jam last Satuday night. Best Jam in Vegas bar none! Totally off the hook and totally entertaining! Blues, Rock, Funk, Soul, R&B and some of the most talented musicians Vegas has to offer. Check out these names that you'll see at the Jam! Christofield, Bruce Ricerd
