5	Great hot wings and burgers with fries. Orders may be slow somtimes but its worth the wait. Great Juke-Box, Kareoke Night on Fridays and Saturdays, you can play pool and play darts in the back. the atmosphere is very fun and lively I had a great time when I was visiting and I will surelly be back when I have the chance.
2	Met up with a friend here to have some drinks. The crowd was very sketchy. Lots of bikers and hoodlums. Was a hold on tight to your wallet tight type of place. Although I hear they have very good wings. Might have to hire a body guard and go check them out.
1	I always hear this place has very good wings, so I decided to try it. I'm sorry, but I can't wait over 40 minutes for take out wings no matter how good the wings are. The waiter acted like she didn't want me in there. She kept telling other customers "your food will be out shorty" leaving me in the dark. Hopefully, if there's a next time I can give you guy's a review on the food and my experience will be better.
1	The only reason they get 1 star is because the wings. This is the most nasty, disgusting and rude place you can sit down n eat. The ppl who horse bet has no respect for other customers. The Russian waitress is a true b****. She rubs me as a racist. The old bar tender finger nails are filthy.  He rubs me as a meth head. The old white lady is for sure a meth addict. PPL SAY NO TO DRUGS N PURPLE TURTLE
4	I got here it's loud! Everyone is having a good time! Beer is cold and the wings are bomb! It's ghetto but it's in the hood so duh!
