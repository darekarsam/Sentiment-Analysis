1	So from the first time I stepped foot in the door I should have known... The yard boy talking trash about my truck, then he blows out the brake lights hooking up the trailer. Stated "that's gonna be a problem" unhooks the trailer and says go inside for a refund. Unbelievable. So I get my brake lights fixed. I should have never gone back. I reserve again and I get the same treatment. Jokes on the radio that they think you don't hear. Snide attitude and comments. Because the yard boy said so. Luckily I was able to just cancel the whole transaction when I realized these jamooks are not getting my money and left. I will never go back to this place even though it is right around the corner from my house. I made this account because I am so upset about the treatment I received from this location. NEVER AGAIN.
1	Make them give you a truck with gas in it.  I got a truck with only a quarter tank left and got no credit for filling it so that I knew I had enough gas to do what I needed.   $86 of gas and all I got was "If you overfill, it's your problem"  Well, it's also going to be your problem because I will never be back and I will be posting reviews like this one anywhere I can find.  Wish there was a zero stars option.
