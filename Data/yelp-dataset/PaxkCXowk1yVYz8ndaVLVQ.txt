1	My company uses this Enterprise on a weekly basis.  We need a car each Tuesday, Wednesday and every other Thursday.  Since October, they have been on time only twice.  When they are late, our schedule is affected and we must use our own vehicle.
1	I rented a mini van from here several months ago.  We were doing a road trip to New Mexico.  Once I picked up the mini van it looked in good shape from the outside and in the driver and passenger side.  Once we got the mini van home and started to load our kids and luggage, we noticed the van was sooo disgusting.  I guess no one vacummed the back of the mini van.  There was crumbs and seats were sticky and the roof top had brown splatters.  We were on a time limit and had to get going.  I promised myself I would never rent from this enterprise ever again.  Once i turned it in, I told the staff about the van and they said there was nothing they could do for me since I didnt notify them when I picked it up.
2	Picked me up, not a selection of cars at all, and very slow
2	I rent from enterprise all the time. I just wasn't feeling the customer service love so I split & hit another enterprise.
3	This was an office in the Frys Grocery center and it is empty now. Far right storefront, next to Great Clips.  Makes me wonder if some of the reviewers got it mixed up with the one further down Baseline or if they just came here before it closed.
