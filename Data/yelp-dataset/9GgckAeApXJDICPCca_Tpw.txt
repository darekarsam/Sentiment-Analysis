5	Very spacious and bright environment. Deco is simple and humble, staying away from the intense trendy and "jetset" so many salons in montreal go for. The staff is very friendly and close; they feel more like friends than hairdressers which makes the ambiance very comfortable and relax. Except for the hair dryers, the place is not too loud and usually play good music.
5	i tried the place two and a half year ago for a straight square haircut, and boy did my hairdresser got it! The girl was just plain amazing. The environment is pretty clean and simple in its decoration. Also, if you want funky colours that stay for months, you go there! They can colour your hair with Elumen, which is a recent type of hair coloring product that can stay up to 3 months in your hair without any touch up. The quality of the product is just amazing!
5	Simon-Pierre & Emilie are the best. I love this place so much. They use Goldwell products (amazing quality) and are great hair dresser. What you pay is what you get !!!
1	I walked in front of the shop yesterday, and it was closed for business (at this address anyway). Oh well :(
