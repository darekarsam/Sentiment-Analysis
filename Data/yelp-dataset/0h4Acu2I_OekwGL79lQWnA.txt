1	Unprofessional waitress.... Waiting for an hour for a patio table, and the waitress completely forgot us and gave 2 patios to somebody just came 5 mins ago...unable to deal with customers' complaints... don't understand English.... We are very disappointed.... Actually the food (main course )  was nice but it definitely doesn't worth the price....beef  tarta ,  duck tarta was delicious,  but other than main course, onion soup is $8 and it's nothing better then an home made onion soup... Overall it's okay... But I wouldn't go for the second time  because I feel like I am paying more then the service they can provide....
1	Expensive but terrible food! The lamb pasta recommend to me tasted worse than the lamb I could get from a mediocre Indian fast food restaurant, and the noodle need to be boiled longer. The restaurant right next to it is much better
