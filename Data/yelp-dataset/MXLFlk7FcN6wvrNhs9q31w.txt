5	Shawn is a master stylist&,colorist.  She maintains the highest level of professionalism all the while keeping your hair at it's healthy, most beautiful state. She is a full service salon . Come in and let Shawn or one of her team members bring out your hidden diva....lol
1	Styles by Shawn what can I say? Hmmmmmm..... Well don't go there if your white. I walked in the door and FOUR "Stylist" refused to give me a haircut. I was discriminated against and there most likely will be a lawsuit to come. Shawn was the only one who did offer to cut my hair when he was finished with his current customer which was very nice of him. I would suggest he get rid of the rest of the racist pieces of sh** he has working there. They unfortunately have involved him in a discrimination lawsuit which is too bad because he seemed like a nice guy.
1	I will NEVER go back to this place again.  Today I had an 9 AM appointment with one of the "stylist" there named Alicia.  I arrived at 8:55 AM (I'm always punctual) long story short I was still in my car waiting on the salon to open at 9:35 AM.  Being pissed off doesn't even describe the way I felt.  My appointment was very important since I needed to get some photographs done for much needed marketing material.  I left this establishment and had to go to a different salon as a walk-in due to their unprofessional behavior.  In all fairness after calling the Shawn's direct cell number she stated that she would not be at the salon on that day, but my appointment wasn't with Shawn...it was with ALICIA! So all-in-all I would never advise anyone to go there and if they did I would certainly tell them to steer clear of ALICIA, the world's most unprofessional stylist!
