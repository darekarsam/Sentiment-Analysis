1	Very low quality. The doctor does not even know much about the equipment that they use on patients, in particular the laser machine. The staff shares this lack of knowledge about comparable machines used in the area by competitors, they just assumed they had the best one. The only benefit is that the staff is bilingual. This does not override lack of knowledge or training . Low professionalism. Cheap medical furniture. Not recommended.
1	The service was terrible there.  I had lasik originally and purchased a package where if I needed a touch up, i would just pay $400 per eye.  The doctor told me he purchased the practice and would not honor the service.  I was ok with that.  I had a routine eye exam done there and got glasses that week. I called back and asked for my prescription 2 months later because I decided to get contacts and they wouldn't give it to me!  What a crock!  They said I needed to come in for a fitting (I was planning to go to another place for the fitting).  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!
5	I had botox here so I can not speak for the LASIK. Staff was very friendly. There was this one woman who decided to play loud music on speaker from her phone and they politely asked her to take it outside, which was very nice considering it's very rude to play your own music in a doctors office. My wait time was very short and I was in and out within 15 minutes. Will be back in 3 months :)
