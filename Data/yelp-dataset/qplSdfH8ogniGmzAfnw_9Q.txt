5	These therapists do remarkable work on tense muscles and imbalances. I've seen Michael, Tate, and Dustin each for structural physiotherapy sessions and very pleased with my results thus far. I would highly recommend them if you need serious massage therapy. This is not necessarily a spa environment if you want just to  relax. Just let them know your choice for music and they will change the station and adjust the volume to what is comfortable if you ask. After my session my therapist put a home exercise plan together for me which I feel is indicative of how much these people care about getting people better.
4	I strongly recommend this business. I found everyone at Stuctura to be very professional, and personable. They have a way of making everyone feel like they are important. I appreciated the way they would let their customers know when they were running any specials. Micheal is wonderful. I look forward to my next visit!
