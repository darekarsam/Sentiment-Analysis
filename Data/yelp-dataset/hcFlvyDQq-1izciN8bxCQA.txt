3	Not much cheap take out in the area. Thank goodness it's good! The staff is friendly like mentioned in another review. Definitely worth a try.
1	Not good! Really, not good. I had lunch here. I was so disappointed. The crab rangoon, had no crab, just a scant amount of filling.  My lunch consisteted of a neon orange rice. Strange looking, and bad tasting. The food was so bad, I thought we were being pranked.
1	Not good at all.  I was there at 10:40, supposedly they open at 10:30, ordered food, asked at 10 to 11 if I could at least have my tea, the lady very rudely told me they had just opened and didn't have tea yet?  Finally brought my tea, I told her I did not want ice which she ignored, brought the wonton egg drop soup, very greasy, had chicken fried rice, which was very dry, even tried putting some of the soup on top of it.
4	One of my favorite Chinese places around.  Granted, it is a dingy little hole in the wall but I almost always just do take-out.  DELICIOUS!!! Generous portions, great value!!  Great menu!! Friendly and fast... Try the Sesame Chicken on beef lo mein ROCKS!!
