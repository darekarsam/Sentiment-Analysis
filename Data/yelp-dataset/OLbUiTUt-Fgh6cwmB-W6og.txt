1	I spent a semester at Ottawa after trying ASU's teaching program. Fully regret that decision. I wish I would have just changed majors to go to ASU instead. Didn't care for the classes and it got to the point where they told me I had to pay an entire semester without loans and grants before I could get financial aid again. Um, if I could pay without loans why would I collect loans? I am now in the hole for the classes I took while being a few months away from completing my degree at ASU which has been much better.
5	Fabulous school. Great teachers and helpful staff.
4	Ottawa University was a welcomed breath of fresh air after attending University of Phoenix.  98% of the facilitators were involved, caring and really knew the subject they were in charge of.  I truly see and feel the value of my degree.
