1	I paid this place $150 to handle a speeding ticket in Henderson. They never showed for court and I was mailed a warrant. I called them and then they lied to me and told me that they appeared. Incompetence and downright rudeness ensued. Talked to the supposed owner Kirk Helmick who was useless and belligerent . Read their google reviews. I guess I'm not the only one tricked by the pink building ......
5	Was referred from sister in vegas after he did an excellent job with tickets. Used him for an issue in las vegas, and was impressed by professionalism. Outcome in my favor! Thanks ryan and team.
1	If I could give zero stars I would.I got a speeding ticket in Feb 2014,my bill was $148.so I toulk my ticket to them and paid $100,they told me they would go to court the end of April.after that I never received a letter or a call from them.today sept 2014 I received a letter from court in the mail that I am past due on my ticket so I called the law office and they told me the $100 is just to go to court,really!!!!so my bill is still $148 and I am past due.they told me on the phone: oh no arrest warrant is issued yet!!!!!!!!!seriously.please don't go their total ripoff.go to court by yourself.they never did anything for me than just put the money in their pocket!!!!!!
