5	BOLD Flavors!  Great Set-up!  Nice Looking "Rustic" (I think) Decor!Great Tasting Olive Oils and Balsamic Vinegars!  Espresso is one of my favorite Balsamic Vinegars, Strawberry mixed with Basil Infused Olive Oil was very good too!  They had some recommended pairings that were very good!Most of these Olive Oil/ Balsamic Vinegar "Tasting Bars"  are in a square shape retail space - This place is long, rectangular and I like that much more, because it is easier to keep up with what you have already tasted!The Persian Lime was the only real disappointment!  It tasted like Lime Rind Bitter, instead of Lime Juice Sour!  All the others were Fantastic!
5	Great variety and Great set up. The selection of oils and vinegars is fantastic and trying each one just once is not enough. Doug's knowledge on the selection was more than helpful and truly fascinating. Ive heard such great things of this place and I'm glad I finally walked in. It is so reasonably priced and so good thats its Impossible to walk out of their empty handed, watch out!
5	This echo's the other 5 start reviews.  I have had my oil and vinagar for about 4 months now and love them.  This place is a stop for me for Holiday Gifts.  How can you go wrong???
5	Finally... I have found the ultimate olive oil store!  Actually...very fortunate to have a great friend share a coupon offer.   Oh my...the short visit to tastes some great oils.  The great infused oils and fantastic balsamic vinegars will just blow your mind!   I am planning on another trip soon to get taste and get more oils.  I tried many and purchased the hojiblanco...a medium oil that mixed great with the cinnamon pear balsamic.  The organic garlic was simply amazing!  The owner (Doug) provided a great overview of the oils.  Looking forward to getting back there soon.  I also cooked tilapia today and added various spices to the oil for great flavor.  I drizzled the oil and spices over the tilapia and wrapped in foil and baked!  Ohhhh my goodness, the flavors were incredible!!!  Yum is the word!! Yum, yum yum!!!
5	Excellent selection. The staff will make good recommendations. They are knowledgable about their products.
5	I came in here happy to see a store similar to ones I've seen in NYC and elsewhere. The staff there is very friendly, most likely owners, and they want you to feel comfortable tasting as much as you'd like. They even offer to help with good pairings already pre-determined. Of course I had to taste everything since we were getting a gift basket for my brother-in-law. My favorite was actually the traditional aged balsamic. I guess I'm old school like that.I'd give it 5 stars if they allow you to come back and refill a previously purchased bottle for a slight discount, which I've seen in similar places. That would be return customers galore!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Update: So I got a response from the Store Manager, and she mentioned, "you CAN bring back your bottle for a discount on a refill!  I'm sorry that you didn't know that. :(  We suggest you toss the cork and run the bottle through the dishwasher, then we will refill it for $1 off the original price.  It can be refilled with whatever you'd like!  We will give you a new cork and re-seal the bottle."Great! 5 stars it is.
