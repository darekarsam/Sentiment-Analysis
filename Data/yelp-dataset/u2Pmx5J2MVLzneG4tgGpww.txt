4	We had a friend who moved to Phx with nothing after a break up and we had to find something for him quick.  This place is actually very close to my house, so we went over & checked the place out and it's actually nicer than I thought it would be, but I'm wondering if it also depends on what section you live in?  We haven't had any bad reports from our friend who's been living there for a few months now.  It's great for him bc of the address he can work out of his home and it looks like it's a business address, so that's one advantage.  When I walk my dog around the neighborhood & I run into people who live there I have to say the MAJORITY of the people I've met (other dog people) are really very nice.
