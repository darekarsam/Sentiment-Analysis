1	OMG!!!! If I could give this place a negative 12 stars, I would!I took some parts in to be re-chromed. After 4 trips over there, a long way from my house, and a complete run-around, they still hadn't finished the work on my parts and it had been over two months! Who gives a crap how good or bad their work is, when it takes that long, or longer, to get them to finish your stuff! Complete waste of time, and I finally went over and demanded they return my items on the spot, which they did. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!
5	Phukin awesome, is the best way I can describe there work. Jamie and the guy know there stuff so well and perform every time. Ashley, the receptionist is awesome to talk to and even better to look at. The pricing isn't the cheapest but the work is well worth it!
4	Slow but great work. They had to work with some rough material but did a fantastic job. Totally happy.
