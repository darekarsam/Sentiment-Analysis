5	Deep, bright colours. Rich. Fresh. Innovative. Creative. Havre-aux-Glaces is in a special location, just by the Atwater Market and the Lachine Canal. Not only is there so much to do, but so much to see and enjoy. Montreal is beautiful, especially in the summer, and nothing is more soothing than a mouth-watering ice cream or sorbet to top it off. While you enjoy your icy-cool treat, explore the Market's vast variety of vendors. From alluring flowers, to local and fresh produce, as well as assorted cheeses from all over the world, fine wines, a wonderful bakery, and so much more. You could spend hours just exploring, relaxing, and finding pleasure in what the Atwater Market has to offer.Take a walk down the Lachine Canal with your ice cream or sorbet, sit on the grass by the water, watch the dogs play, and the runners and bikers whisk on by. If you're feeling more adventurous, rent a pedal-boat or even an electric-charged boat (don't get ahead of yourself, it's slow), enjoy the scenery from the canal and be astonished by the rich history that surrounds you.When you pass by Havre-aux-Glaces to quench your palate, you are quenching each and every sense. The experience that comes with it makes it so much more than picking up a simple ice cream or sorbet. My favourites are strawberry with black pepper and blood orange. Now get ready to have your mind blown.
5	Great ice cream! Probably one of the best in Montreal. They are only open during the summer and serve only ten flavors but they are all delicious
5	The other reviewers are 100% correct. This is the best gelato I have tried in Montreal. Where Billboquet was underwhelming, every flavour I have sampled from Havre Aux Glaces has been extraordinary. They keep a freezer full of half-litres for takeaway in addition to the flavours in their cooler for sampling. Highly recommend the pear & sortilege as well as the ginger.
