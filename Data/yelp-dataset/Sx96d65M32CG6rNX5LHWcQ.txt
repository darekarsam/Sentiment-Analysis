5	Not only is the place for your Birks purchases, but here is where you go to for their repair & resoling as well as the special sealer for the cork base.I've had both pairs resoled, the second, with nonslip rubber, highly recommended. Service was very timely and satisfactory, and they really know their Birks.
5	Best place to buy Birkenstocks in Montreal (they also carry these strange Japanese tree saws for what it's worth). Knowledgeable and friendly staff. The owner, if he's there, is prone to being hands-on with your feet, and he's good at recommending the perfect Birk for you. Great repair service as well although keep in mind that, while the environmentally friendly thing to do, repairing your birks (sole and cork) will run you about $100.
5	Amazing, AMAZING service. We were there today and I am still impressed by their profesionalism and knowledge. My boyfriend was looking for Birkenstocks for work and he got great help with the owner. By the way - he will have you take your shoes off to better understand your needs. It's a great store for specific needs and for Birks, and the service will definitely turn you into a frequent customer.
