5	One of the best burgers I have ever eaten. Great fries. Great service. Lots of toppings. Will come back every time I am in the area. Yum!
4	Best. Milkshake. Ever. I decided that after a long day at work I wanted a treat....no correction...I deserved a treat for making it through the workday...lol...so I stopped at Cook Out for a chocolate milkshake and some onion rings...When I saw the milkshake...my mouth watered and then I tasted it and...OH MY GOODNESS....delicious!!! Creamy, thick and super delicious taste...it was perfect! The onion rings were hot, just made to order...and I was in heaven! Crispy and hot...just like I like them!!!I'm truly a new fan of Cook Out and I'll be back for my milkshake fix...very soon!
2	Tasty fries. Very bad cheeseburger. Claimed to be charbroiled, no charbroil flavor at all, no char marks on meat.  Meat had a livery, gamey flavor, and was dry. Took two bites and threw it out.
1	Do NOT go there! This restaurant stole my credit card information and sent it to someone in Georgia, who tried to buy lots of stuff. Luckily, my credit card company caught it in time. The restaurant is already under investigation for criminal behavior. Buyer beware!!
3	Typical fast food joint with tons of different options to satisfy the inner fast food junkie in you.The milkshakes here are really good. And you can customize them however you want. Their burgers and fries are not bad either.Prices are cheap, and they are open late.
2	Great menu with a lot of choices.   The restaurant was extremely busy - the order was incorrect.  Hush puppies were cold and received 1 onion ring.
