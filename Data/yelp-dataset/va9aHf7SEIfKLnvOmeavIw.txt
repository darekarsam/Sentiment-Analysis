3	Great specials averaging around $7.  The portions are extra large.  Large seating area.  This is your typical quick Japanese style stir fry.  Teriyaki and Hibachi stuff!   One thing that sucks - No egg rolls!  WTF?
3	The place a hole in the wall with handwritten signs all over the place. The food is decent at a fair price and the people are friendly. I most likely will return.
4	This is the place for great priced hibachi. The selections are the same as those restaurants who put on a show (but also charge double for the food). The food is always fresh and the service is always friendly. I moved back here from California recently and I can say that I've really missed these guys! Would recommend to friends & family.
5	I just started teaching nearby and thought I'd try this place out. Yes, it is bare bones when you walk in, but you should know that by the "Express" in the restaurant's name. This is somewhere to get your eats and keep it moving. The portions are HUGE and at a fair price. Service is quick and food it hot. I ordered chicken and shrimp combo. Both were moist, and with broccoli, mushrooms, and carrots I didn't feel so bad about my Japanese craving. I'll definitely return!
1	Don't waste your time. Overpriced low quality hibachi. You can tell from the moment you walk in (cardboard handwritten signs screaming no return/ not responsible for food issues) that maybe you should turn around and leave. I however made the mistake of staying. I purchased the beef teriyaki combo (which was rung up wrong and had to be fixed after I waited for my food for 20 mins). The beef was over cooked and too lightly sauced, the rice was bland and carrots overcooked into mush. Not worth the stomach ache I had the rest of the day.
3	This place is good if you want a quickie! Good Japanese hibachi and an inexpensive place. It is a simple restaurant with no fancy decor. No private parking. Large dining room and has public restrooms! Would recommend!
