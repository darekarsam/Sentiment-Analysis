5	Love their massages !! It's not a big place, but the service is great and their massotherapists are very good at what they are doing... I have been there a couple times now, they treated my shoulder and neck pain and now no more headaches :) definitely worth it!
5	I went there primarily because it is right next to my work, not expecting much, but truth is that the spa compensate the location disadvantage with amazing service, i stepped in and got greeted as if im entering my own house. I went for a massage after work and it was just perfect, they asked me questions through out the process to see how they can customize the massage and the hand pressure according to how tense i feel. I left really happy, and I actually came back for the same massage with my girl friend this week and we had a great time.
