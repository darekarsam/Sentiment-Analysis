1	My order was simple: two large pepperoni pizzas and a two-liter of coke. An hour and a half later, the driver showed up reaking of some herbal substance or other and forgot my coke. No biggie, but I called back to complain and I got hung up on. What's up with that?
1	They were busy and I have problems with my legs. They weren't able to show the gracious ability to make sure that I was happy with the experience. So my advice is not to go there unless you are totally healthy. Besides that. .the food certainly wasn't that great. No more for me . I'll go back to the great service and good quality of our favorite pizza place
