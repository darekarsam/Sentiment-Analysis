5	I needed an updo for two consecutive nights and was thrilled with Tisha's work!  Not only was Tisha incredibly professional, she was also sweet and friendly!  I brought in pictures of several half-up half-down styles and after the consultation, in which Tisha made sure she knew exactly what I wanted, she got to work and boy, was she quick!  I've had many updos/styles over the years and all have taken upwards of 2 hours.  I was so surprised when Tisha was done in about an hour, with, easily, the best updo I've ever gotten!  She used a great curling technique with a flat iron and frequently checked in to make sure she was on the right path to the look I wanted.  For both nights, my hair stayed in place to the very last curl. She even made sure that my downward hanging curls would last by loosely pinning them up so I could take them out right before my event, as well as covering my head with a shower cap when I left to fight the downpour.  I am definitely coming back to her for my next event!
5	I moved to Charlotte last year, and after an awful experience at a salon near my house, I decided to look on Yelp, and read a great reviews about Tisha. She has been my stylist ever since! I have long, thick blonde hair, and she always gets my color just right, and gives me the perfect cut to manage all this hair! I would recommend her to anyone. She is professional, friendly, and really listens to her clients' needs. I am so thankful I found her!
5	I have gone to Tisha the past three times I've gotten my hair done. She does a wonderful job and is very friendly. I have super thick, curly hair which is difficult to manage at times. She uses a cutting technique that thins out my hair without causing split ends- it's awesome! No matter if it's just a quick cut or color change, Tisha manages to produce amazing work.
