5	On our second visit to this restaurant we were not disappointed. The owner was kind enough to allow two of our party to order something from the lunch menu, lamb shanks, and they both licked their plates.The cream of zucchini was delicious, the salad pleasant, and my roast beef was perfection. The dessert was not quite "there", but nice.The service was perfect, we were allowed our space to dine and talk.I should mention the bread, artisan and crunchy, very tasty.All in all, we WILL be back. Truly.
