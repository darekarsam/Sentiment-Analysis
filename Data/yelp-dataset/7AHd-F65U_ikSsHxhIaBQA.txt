1	Besides getting attitude about how much mayo my wife wanted on her sandwich, the employee named Assi made sandwiches for his friends for free, sat down with them (and ate his own sandwich when there were no customers), and continued a conversation with them while helping other customers. This would explain why he was so distracted that he closed the register before giving me my change.  Poor customer service.
1	Again, more issues from the employee with an attitude, Assi.  This time tried to fool my wife into thinking that Subway had closed early.  The current time was 8:45pm and they close at 10pm.  No respect and continued to treat my wife in a belittling way.  Is there a number I can call to fix this poor customer service???
3	They make your sandwich the way you ask for it.  Plus, they're fast and gave me a free cookie card for being in the health profession.Three stars because I consider Subway to be an average chain and not gourmet food.
