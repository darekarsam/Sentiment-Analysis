3	I was strolling through town today and found myself over by Brevard Court Sundries restaurant & bar. I think it was the cool looking alleyway that lured me in; I had never been over there and liked how it was tucked away. Definitely off the beaten path of the usual uptown crowd, which is sometimes not a bad thing. We stayed for a couple of beers, and our favorite part was listening to the guy outside playing acoustic guitar and singing along. This place looks like it has been here for ages, but really it was established in 02. Their dishes are pretty basic, like london broil, salmon, and meatloaf, and they are right near the Bank of America Stadium so they draw a chill crowd. Great place to grab a beer with friends and definitely not too fancy or uptight.
3	Brevard Court is good for an inexpensive lunch.  Nothing fancy, though.  The Wednesday salmon special is particularly good, as is Tuesday's London broil.  It's your standard fare of burgers and salads, lots of fried stuff (if healthy is your game, try another ballpark). This is a good spot to grab a beer prior to the Panthers game or after work.
3	On business in Charlotte, walking around downtown in muggy weather with colleagues looking for a place for lunch. The original destination was the French Quarter, but when I mentioned that I had been there before (and enjoyed it) they insisted on going somewhere else. As we stopped there was Brevard Court Sundries so that was it. Although there is a street level entrance the restaurant is upstairs, and up we went. Very busy place. Everything was no-nonsense which is actually great for a quick lunch. Quick service, lots of water, and quick delivery of our orders, Cajun blackened chicken and shrimp over pasta for me. More water a quick delivery of the bill and we were on our way.
