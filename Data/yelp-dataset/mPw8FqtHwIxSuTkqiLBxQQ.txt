1	I used to watch WPXI news bc I can't stand Wendy "Now get this..." Bell on WTAE I got tired of all the human interest stories on KDKA.  Now, I can barely stand to watch WPXI bc I cant stand watching Darieth Chisholm stumble her way through each news cast.She used to be an amazing anchor.  I don't know what's wrong.  Can't the print on the teleprompter be enlarged or something?  She stumbles over her words so often that I actually feel bad for her. It's so annoying, I never watch this channel anymore.
1	Honestly this station is so annoying in the way they preempt programs to put on "emergency updates" for weather, sports, news etc. In most instances a simple announcement would be sufficient, followed by a banner where appropriate.  But what they do is repeat the same information over and over until I just turn them off. The other local affiliates seem to have a more balanced approach to what is newsworthy,  and will get the information out and go back to programming.  Not WPXI! They remove the programming and air what they will then repeat on their following newscast. Bye bye WPXI. I find you too intrusive and too annoying.
