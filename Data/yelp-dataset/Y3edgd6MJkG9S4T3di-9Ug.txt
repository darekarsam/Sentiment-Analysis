5	This location Its really nice. Its easy to get in and out with just what you need. I like the fact that the staff will remember your name.
3	Walgreens can be like Starbucks. If you don't like the one closest to you there's another one right up the road. That being said this location is not far from several parks and trails so if your first aid kit didn't quite do the trick if you got hurt on the trail or playing soccer in the park, you can get what you need to fix yourself up fast. Access: From Boulder Highway going Northbound make sure you turn Left at the Russell light and then into the parking lot, otherwise it's a hassle to make a U turn as crossovers are not spaced the best on Boulder Highway. If you need a 24 hour location just head South or North on Boulder Highway to find one. 3 Stars: Friendly pharmacists, usually no checkout lines either.
1	Asked nicely a question. Literally. And the manager in charge was a bitch. I was asking about the Star Wars exclusive really nice.  And she flat out said no. Not all walgreens carry it. :( imagine in a rude voice White hair older lady in a manager vest.
