4	This is a great, new Sainsbury's Local that opened up between Haymarket and Prince's Street. It opened just three weeks ago and is really new and nice with even good hardwood floors. Even though it is a local-sized store, the selection is pretty good and prices are reasonable for the central location, and they even had some pretty good markdowns, too. The only thing I think they're still ironing out is the queue for the checkout. Although there were two 'lanes', one for the self-checkout and one for the actual people, all the customers just queued in one of the sides. There were lots of self-checkouts, though, and they did a fairly good job of moving people through the checkout process. It's great to have this new Sainsbury's location!

Before this Sainsbury's was recently opened, I had to go to Co-Op over the road, which is pretty big, but if you went there at lunch time the the queues were HUGE! Now I have Sainsbury's, and what a delightful Sainsbury's it is. I'm not sure what it is, but I find walking in here somewhat calming. As far a supermarkets go, it is quite an attractive one. The fruit and veg section is really spread out so you can browse in peace without anyone invading your personal space.Once you have your items, there are a variety of self-service checkouts for you to choose from, so queuing is never an issue. The staff also seem very lovely and ready for a chat.An all round lovely supermarket in my opinion! :)
