4	Great selection of moderate to pricey shoes for men and women.  The salesman that helped us was very helpful.  Try and bargain with them if you plan on purchasing more than one pair of shoes.  They typically can offer you some % off.
1	Bad quality...$150 shoes completely wore off after only 3 months
4	great choice of cool brands for real men
4	Great shoe store that carries a selection of brand names for men and women.Lots of quality brands like Pajar, Converse, Geox, Lascote, etc.Many leather boots and unique styles not found in your bigger stores around here.They often have sales, they even pay the tax sometimes and people running the place are very helpful.One time I bought a pair of Adidas boots from Little Burgundy which is right next door, as I walked into Bellini, a sales guys peeked through my bag and curiously asked what I got. Turns out, they carried the exact same shoe but about 30$ cheaper. I immediately turned around to return the pair I had purchased 10 mins ago in favor of this discount.Since then, I made sure to compare brands and always found Bellini had the best prices. One of the owners remembers me and everytime I walk by, he asks how I am doing and what I'm looking for. The people at Bellini make an effort to accommodate to you. It's personalized sales I haven't found anywhere else.The only drawback is that sale items are final purchase.
