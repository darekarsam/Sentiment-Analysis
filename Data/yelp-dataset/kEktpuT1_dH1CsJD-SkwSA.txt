5	I really enjoyed working with Amerizona. They came to our house to give us an estimate. They were very friendly, knowledgable, and answered our questions. Once we decided to order the sunscreens they came out the next day to measure. The service guy was by quick. Originally they quoted us 3 weeks to get everything done, but they were so amazing the screens were installed the following week! The screens look beautiful and I've already noticed a difference in the temperature of our house (since its been hot already!) I'm so glad I used them!
5	We  had AmeriZona outfit our home with sunshades and vertical blinds in 2005. Dustin was very professional and knowledgeable. He installed the blinds and shades and we were completely satisfied with the quality and workmanship.We sold that home in 2010 and once again called and Dustin came out to give us a quote. This time we bought wood blinds as well as verticals and sunscreens. Once again the service and quality was impeccable!I have never been so pleased with a company.  Everything remains in perfect condition and working order. I just wish they made awnings! I highly recommend Amerizona!LaVon Schneider
