5	I've always had good food and good service at this location.  Friendly, food tastes like it is fresh off the grill, and correct order.  I'm comparing the food here with other jack in the boxes not high end restaurants. :)
1	I used to like this jack in the box,  but not any more. They just charged me nine bucks for a number ten. The menu displays just under seven bucks, but what what ever. I don't even like fast food.  I don't like it even more when i get two dollars in tax for something under ten bucks. I guess it's about convenience
