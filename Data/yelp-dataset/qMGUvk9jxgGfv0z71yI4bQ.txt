4	Great service.. Still waiting on our title though..:(
1	MANAGEMENT IS EXTREMELY RUDE AND NOT KEEPERS OF THEIR WORD! BEFORE I bought my vehicle, they promised they would fix a few things if I decided to purchase the car through them. I took them at their word, boy was I stupid! They claimed to fix things but never did, but in the end, my vehicle developed more problems. I tried to sit down with management and explain what's going on, the guy was a total ass wipe! He was defensive like I was accusing him personally, and insulted the hell outta me. Demanded I leave his office, I refused. I said CALMLY what I needed to say. He told me I'm making problems up, I don't know what I'm talking about and the car is just fine. I told him if he truly believed that, come drive my car and see. HE REFUSED! That was a clear indication that he knew there was a problem and didn't want to take responsibility. $14,000 I'll be making in payments to liars, cheaters, and unprofessional fools. Just remember, what goes around comes around.
5	Great place! Friendly people who are super helpful.  Ask for Robert to help you find a car,  he's patient and fun to be around.  And Ralph, The GM,  is an awesome guy.  He has helped me out in many ways. If I ever have an issue, he gets it taken care of ASAP.  Word to the wise, pay your bills on time and treat them all with respect and they will take care of you.- Lucas B
