5	C'est mon restaurant vietnamien prefere! La nourriture est toujours bonne, savoureuse et bien presentee! Le service est courtois et rapide, en plus que c'est pas cher du tout. Maintenant, ils font la livraison en plus.
4	There are some nights when you feel like some comfort food after a good days work!  For me this was the night as I really felt like a nice bowl of noodles after a long day!  So.... I decided to Yelp a Vietnamese place and found Pho Asie.  It looked promising so I decided to give it a shot.  I ordered the grilled meat vermicelli (shrimp, chicken, pork & beef) with vermicelli, sprouts, mint leaf and shredded vegetables. It came with a really nice light but tasty vegetable and noodle starter soup!  Oh, yes it also came with a nice big crispy spring roll.  A little more expensive than usual $14.95 but rarely is it a meat lovers delight!  It came out and was amazing!  I mixed in the Nuoc mam (dipping sauce) and some sriacha and dove right in!  Flavour was great as you had the grilled meat taste with the mix of the fresh mint leaf and vegetables, also with a bit of spice of the sriracha it was just what the doctor ordered.  The restaurant itself is your typical Vietnamese place.  a good amount of tables and not the epitome of decor but the food is worth it!  I know have another place to keep a mental note where I know I can get a good authentic Vietnamese meal when the craving is there!
4	Every weekend after my work. I come to this place for pho. This place never let me down. Except sometime the richness of the soup is little bit different as I can tell they added too much water. But overall. It's great place.
