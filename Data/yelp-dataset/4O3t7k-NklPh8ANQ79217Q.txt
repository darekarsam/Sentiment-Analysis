4	I always make a New Year's resolution to learn something new or improve a skill. My vow to improve my sewing in 2012 has caused me to become a regular customer at Remnant Kings, shopping for supplies for dress making projects. They have a great supply of patterns, fabric, haberdashery and sewing notions (they have The Hungry Caterpillar fabric!!) but they also have a great team of staff on hand of help and offer advice. On my first visit to the store I needed help choosing a particular type of fabric for a dress. The staff were really helpful and helped me choose the right material for the dress I was making and even went and got me matching thread.  Great value, great service and great fabric!
5	I could wrap myself in these fabrics all day long, yes i sure could!  From curtain to dressmaking and craft - they have it all.  I've seen a couple of fabrics for my "project curtain" and also set my eye on a Liberty Fabric for a top/dress - yes they do a selection of Liberty fabrics!  Plus they are starting up dress making courses to which I've signed up for!  I think they do one to make kids clothing too.   Along with fabrics they have the tools that you may require when doing these projects.  They staff are pretty awesome too.  I asked a few different staff members different questions and I had great answers too! Another good thing is they have car parking, so no danger of running out of coins for the meter!
