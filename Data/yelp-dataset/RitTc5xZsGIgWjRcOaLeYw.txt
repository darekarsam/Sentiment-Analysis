5	Very friendly here. Great customer service. People need to remember this is an ice cream shop not mcdonalds. Yeah they have food items but DQ is all about the frozen treats!
5	Victoria was very helpful and friendly  hope the cake is as good as the customer service )))
4	My wife and I eat here at least once a month to satisfy our Blizzard cravings. We usually ask for chocolate ice cream and extra peanut butter syrup. I will on occasion have an Orange Julius to wash it all down. The small and medium sizes are big enough.
