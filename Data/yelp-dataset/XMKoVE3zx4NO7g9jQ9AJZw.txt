4	A new gas station that opened up in the area a few months ago.  Bright, clean, large convenience store.  Right next to Target and Win Co.Best part?  Coke slushies for cheap!
4	Can I say it's about time a gas station opened up between Costco and Ann road?! A large, cheap convenience store with cheap gas that you don't need a Costco membership for? I mean, what else could you ask for!! It's probably the nearest gas station near my neighborhood that actually has a pretty big convenience store :) Need to start a road trip with 100s of gas station snacks? AMPM is the place for you :)
3	One of the cheaper gas stations in NLV. It's brand new, I remember when there was nothing here but a pile of dirt. Nothing new to say about a gas station but the car wash & free vacuums are a plus. You can add a car wash when paying for your gas at the pump. (Starting at $5). And the Pay At The Pump is so convenient especially since there is a 35 cent fee for using debit/credit cards to purchase gas. :/
5	Easy to get in and out location.  Plenty of pumps, nice car wash and lots of drinks/snacks are available.  The staff are usually friendly but there is a pay at the pump feature making it super convenient!Tip...bring cash unless you want to pay the extra surcharge!!
1	I went in to pump gas and get my car washed,  I asked for military discount and they only have military discount on Mondays, cause the military only serves on Mondays   smh
