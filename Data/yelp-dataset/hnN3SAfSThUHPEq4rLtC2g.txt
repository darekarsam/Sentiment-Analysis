4	This review speaks to pretty much any Firehouse I've ever been to no matter the city or state. The staff is generally nice and always enthusiastic, "Welcome to Firehouse!". They use quality meats in their sandwiches and the bread works well with how they do a sub (toasted and then loaded with steamed meat and cheese, then dressed). That being said, you better like a hot sub or Firehouse is not really for you. I just like subs period. Hot, cold, whatever.... I'm stuffing them in my face and enjoying the heck out of them! My two favorites are the New York Steamer which is corned beef, pastrami, cheese, Italian dressing and mayo/mustard and, the Engine Company which seems to not be on the menu board anymore but is still available if you ask. roast beef, turkey, cheese and whatever fixings you want from their list. The only location where I've ever had a problem is the one at the EpiCentre. 3 visits to get a sub to go for lunch and 2 of those times I got back to my desk only to unwrap something other than what I ordered.  Definitely not enough to sour me overall however.
3	Just like all the other Firehouse subs that I've been to.  They make great subs, much better than Subway.  Service was fast here, even with a group of 15.
3	The subs are tasty -- I like the Turkey Bacon Ranch -- however, if you take it with you, expect it to be a bit soggy from condensation or whatever.
5	Best staff and best sub here in Charlotte.  Even though it's always busy in here the staff always make sure to walk buy to clean your trays and ask how the food go.  Best deal on Sunday for every adult combo you can get 2 free kids meals.
5	I have visited this firehouse at least 10 times.  Always fast friendly service.   Firehouse always makes their Italian on point.  Yet to be disappointed.
