4	I walked in expecting to be inundated by salespeople. But no, nothing, I was left alone and browsed in peace. It was soooo nice. I am looking to buy a lot of furniture for a house we just bought and this is the place.Beautiful furniture and accessories.I recommend this place for a peaceful and stress-free shopping experience.
5	I LOVE this store. They have EVERYTHING anyone would want to decorate their home. Signs, clocks, flowers, rugs, fountains, furniture, lamps, trinkets... Everything. The prices are not what you'd expect either, they're definitely affordable. We go every time were in town, and we always find something new and fun!
4	Expansive store carrying a wide selection of everything you can think of for your home. From sofas, to wall clocks, grandfather clocks, and silk flowers, the items here exude a warm yet sophisticated air. For some reason they also have a plethora of small little dog statues also placed around the store, adding a cute atmosphere to the mix. The associate here seemed fairly disinterested in our browsing, but was at the center station in case we needed to ask him anything.
