5	The one I went to w/ the wife was on Maryland just north of the Best Buy. Not sure if there's one where this address is listed. So this was once Susie's Deals (and 1 of my wife's favorites) but one day she went to do a stop by to browse their selection and they were closed down. She was so sad about this, then a few months later one of these bad boys pop up.They definitely lack in the men's dept but it was kind of expected. The women's selection, on the other hand, is quite impressive. Like any good discount place, you'll have to put in work to find the gold but any treasure hunter knows if you put in the time you're likely to reap great rewards (at a great deal). If you like finding steals of a deal don't pass up a stop by any one of these joints.
4	I would give this place an easy five stars but the super discounts like to offer no try on area. I did ask if I could try on without the mirror and they said it was fine so, bring a  fairly large mirror (that fits in your purse) so, you can get some idea of how you look. Anyway, I loved Susies Deals but this is sooo much better because no 5.99 deals. The max is 2.99! This is even better than the Alley in downtown LA because its one store vs lots of mini stores with the same merchandise. There is a plethora of quality closeout clothing and if you wear it a few times you more than get your moneys worth. I know lots of girls get hair, makeup, and nails for a date and easily blow through 75.00 so, what's 6.00 for a new outfit?!
5	Super fun and cute tops also for pretty cheap prices! And not to mention they even have forever 21 clothing and charlotte Rouse! Just a tip seems that everything is color coded just take your time examining the item you've selected and inspect it for any rips and stains (these are damaged) Other than that pretty cool if you ask me!.
