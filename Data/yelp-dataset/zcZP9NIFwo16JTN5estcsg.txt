5	I love the asiago ranch chicken sandwich with a spicy chicken. The bun was fresh and the chicken tasted like it had just been made. The salads are fresh and un-wilted. The employees are helpful and smile. I like this location a lot.
2	There was no one in line before or after us and we only ordered one thing, yet the lady still managed to be a bit rude and dump our fries upside down in the drive thru bag. How hard would it have been to not mess up? Just yucky.
1	Wendy's has gone waaaay down hill.  Ever sunce they changed the menu to sweet pickles, frys and red onions its hard to enjoy a meal here.Wendys change the menu back!!!!!
4	Fast service, whether you're inside or in the drive thru. Once I order, I usually have my food in less than 3 min. Food is always fresh and doesn't seem like it's been sitting, like other fast food places.
1	Its been a year since my last review, this location is doing as good job as they can but the new menu is falling flat.  Bring the classics back.  Please.
