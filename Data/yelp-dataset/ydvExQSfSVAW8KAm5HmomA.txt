5	They gave my dad two new teeth! No more russian sailor smile! The doctors seems very patient and undrestanding, and gave him a ton of reading material and instruction. He said the surgery was easy, and loved it.
1	Wow!! Talk about unprofessional. I had the worst experience dealing with Maria. My wife and I had called in about a $50 charge which we should not have been charged for. We attempted to discuss the charge and payment options but Maria continuously put us on hold without permission then would hang up. I called back and she ranted at me for 2 minutes straight without allowing me to say a word "...and if you don't want to pay it then don't"!! And hung up again. We called back to speak to the owners to try to resolve the dispute professionally and she had another girl answer the phone who then told us she doesn't work "in the back" and can't help us. I could clearly hear Maria coaching her on what to say in the back. Then instructed her to hang up on us again. Never allowing us to discuss the original problem. It was very confusing and the worst experience I have had with any establishment. I definitely wouldn't ever go back. And to think we were going to go here for our kids braces. They just gave up thousands of dollars of dental work for $50.
