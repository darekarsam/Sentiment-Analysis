2	I mean its a McDonald's, so expect McDonald's type of food.  The only reason I am reviewing this sub-par McDonald's is to note that their breakfast burritos suck.  I don't mean to make this personal, but whoever they've got back there may be an expert at flipping burgers, but doesn't have a clue about rolling burritos. On a positive side, they support the local area by having different community events such as McTeacher night in which teachers from a local school volunteer for a few hours with proceeds going back to schools.  If you have to go here for breakfast, stay away from the breakfast burritos!!
1	This place is awful and does not meet McDonald's standards by a long shot. Do not stop here. Servic3 is terrible dood is xold and usually comes out wrong.
