1	I have experienced Jet Cab a couple of times and find the owner to be completely rude. At the airport I have witnessed him bully other drivers. Last night he drove up on a guest's bumper and honked his horn all because the guest was picking someone up curbside and had pulled into the 'Taxi Stand' spot. Seriously - the guest was only in the spot for 60 seconds as their pickup was standing right there! But nooooooo, Mr. Jet had to make it known that the space should have been his and how dare the guest be in his spot.What Mr. Jet doesn't seem to understand is that without the airline passengers, his job would be reduced to puking college kids after last call instead of clean-cut business travelers at the airport. He clearly needs to adopt some customer service skills. I highly recommend anyone walk to their destination instead of driving with this pompous jerk.
5	This jet cab service is fast and the price is fair. We always call them whenever we need a cab and it's always on time.i definitely recommend this out of any cab service in C-U!
