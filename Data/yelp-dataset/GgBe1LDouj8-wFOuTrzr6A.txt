5	Not sure why there are no reviews on this location. This is the best place to go for your  Verizon needs. So very pleasant, patient and knowledgeable. They explain everything and are so willing to help with the smallest needs up to what some of us believe are complicated devices! Michael and his team have become my (and my mom's and her friends  in Sun City West ) go-to for all our needs.Keep that music playing in the background you all!!! And thank you for all your help!!
5	Love this place, Deion is awesome.Great willingness to help before, during & after sale. I would recommend this store and this customer service superstar to everyone. He has shown me he's about building relationships with his customers.
2	Deion was helpful and patient. I am usually uncomfortable learning about new devices because I am technically challenged, but Deion made me feel at ease.  I still need more help and I know I won't be nervous about seeking it.Donna
5	I love this store! Not close to my house, but worth the travel for to get great service.  Everyone greeted me as I walked in and was very helpful.  I even took my mother there when she wanted a new phone and she got everything she needed. I will recommend this store to ALL my friends and family!
