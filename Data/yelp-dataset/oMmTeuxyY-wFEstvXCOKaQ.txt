5	as this has been my first time with a chiro, i really have nothing to compare it to, but i have been so pleasantly surprised with the customer service and the results that i'm showering CAS chiropractic with 5 stars.  they must only hire the friendliest people in phoenix (seriously, not the nicest town, but these folks are MINNESOTA nice.)  they all know my name, where i'm from, and what i do (and ask about such things!) after only a few visits.  my hips feel much better while running, and i can do the elliptical without my feet going numb (a big plus, because that's generally pretty disconcerting).  BRAVO CAS chiropractic!
5	Hello, I got into a car accident this past summer and Dr. Mike and his crew really helped me out a lot. I was referred to them by some friends and I was surprised at the rehab they do along with the awesome Chiropratic work. All the doctors and staff know what they are doing. The office is always clean and a really nice place. Try them you will be happy, I was.
5	I am so impressed with Dr. Cas and the staff.  They spend so much time on you unlike those quick in-and-out chiropractic offices.  Dr. Cas spent a lot of time going over my x-rays and explained every bone and muscle that was compromised.  They always take their time and are completely amazing.  I would highly recommend this place!
5	The BEST - Over the past ten years of being wheelchair bound, I've been to 12 other Chiropractors/Physical Therapist that caused a lot of financial hardships with no results. Doctor Mike and his Staff is the only team that truly cared about helping me; today I am out of my wheelchair, hiking in Sedona, riding my Harley again and feeling good about myself. In 2015, our goal is to get rid of the cane. I recommend this office to all my friends, and everyone of them have thanked me.
