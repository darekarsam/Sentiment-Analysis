5	So very happy that Max Health has expanded! Now I can get the attention my body needs (pervert), without having to drive all the way to Henderson. The team is amazing, so knowledgable and truly care about helping you feel better. I'm here every week, now that's love!
5	I love this place. You feel like family. The prices are affordable and honest (insurance or not). I'm so glad they opened a new location.
5	Holy cow. My wish was granted. I was a regular at the other office, and all I wanted was a more central location. Well, a few folks from the old office (Eric and Shanti) came over to start this new office. The new office is super comfy. They have a really nice couch in their waiting room, and ample parking.The quality of the visits are on par with the other office (same massage therapist,) and I actually enjoy the doctor over here way more. Dr. Johnson is super gentle in his adjustments, but gets the job done.
