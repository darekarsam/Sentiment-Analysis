1	I had a very odd experience here. It was busy and the place was packed. I finally waved down the sales girl and got two pairs to try on. There was a large bench and I found a corner to sit down. One of the sales girls raced over and commanded me to move since her customer was trying on shoes in the vicinity. The sales girl was condescending and made me feel like I was committing a crime.  To make things worse, she preceded to giggle with her customer about how much she made me feel like crap. I understand you work on commission but this is too cut- throat for a shoe store.  Definitely not coming here again.
1	When I came into the store, I found a pair of shoes I loved, but low and behold they didn't have my size. Just as I was thinking about turning away, the saleswoman suggested a different pair that was a size larger. She brought them out and I thought they were adorable as well. She even put these pads in the shoes so the size larger didn't feel weird. When I asked how much they were she said "You're not going to believe this, but they were $999, but now they're $79!" She's right, I was very skeptical but I thought "Hey, they're not badly priced for real leather shoes (she said they were real suede) and they're comfy! I just wish they were actually my size."So I bought them. Then I went home and looked on their website what the price was on there and they were always $79.... And to top it off, they were faux suede. Why did she feel the need to tell such a big lie?!I will never shop at this location ever again.
