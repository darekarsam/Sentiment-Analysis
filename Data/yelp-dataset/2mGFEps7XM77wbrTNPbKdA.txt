5	I was recently introduced to Alkaline water and I heard this Water & Ice has a process that is better than most, so I gave it a try. I guess water stores are all pretty similar but what I found at this location, whereby prompting me to give it 5 stars is this: the service was awesome. I was expecting the place to be pretty much self serve, no assistance, figure it out on my own, but I was wrong. Thanks David (owner) for making my first experience with Alkaline water exceptional. I will be back.
5	Very friendly service : customer first.  Stopped for couple bags of ice. There wasn't even a pitch that I could call a soft sell, just really a mention of the expensive, special, magic water, then he offered a brochure and just let it be.  My bill was cheaper than I thought but I only had a debit card, no cash. Instead of suffering the transaction charges from visa for such a small bill, he insisted I just take the ice bags and "get him back next time". Now, your mileage may vary, so dont go in expecting the same and don't take advantage of their hospitality...like I did. Still owe them a buck seventy five.  OOPS, I'm coming dont worry
1	My kids and I went here to fill up our water bottles and to get a couple of snowcones. While checking out the flavors my son noticed some ants crawling around by the syrup. I gave it a closer look and found dead ants floating in the syrup bottles! I let the man that was working know what we saw and he could have cared less. He actually seemed a little offended that I would say anything about it!! Also, when I mentioned they there was mold in the coconut syrup container he wasn't even listening at that point. What horrible customer service, all he had to do was be decent and apparently that was way too much to ask. No thanks "Water and Ice of Arrowhead Ranch", I'll let everyone know to go elsewhere.  By the way, as we were leaving we saw the man serve a snowcone to someone else even after he knew that there were ants in it. Gross.
