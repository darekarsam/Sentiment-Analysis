4	This particular store is like the lost and forgotten one. I actually forgot that this store was still here until the semiannual sale left me scouring for BBWs with larger inventory. This place had all I needed and then some! It's a larger store than the usual BBW with plenty of room to walk around and sample. The sales people were  friendly and helpful too!
5	This place is great. The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable about their products. Lisa is  the best; she is  helpful and extremely nice. This is the ONLY bath and body works in the Las Vegas area that I will shop at from now on.
