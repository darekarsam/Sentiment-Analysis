3	Really disappointed to come in for a scheduled appointment and find no claim had been made, no insurance was verified, never given a price during initial call. Grrrrrr. I used to work for a glass company so, this did not sit well with me initially.  However, even with the little hiccup, they were still on schedule and the staff was polite and got me out of their on time - according to the original timeframe given - so that did put me in a better mood when I left.  I guess I would use them again if the need arose.
1	Got my window replaced only to find they had torn the moulding that runs down the length of the cars roof. Had to wait a day for them to order a new one so i had to go back for them to install it. They decided to put an hour long curing epoxy on the clips which made a 5 minute job mess up my day since i had to wait. I will not come back here and i dont think anyone else should either. Their mistakes will cost you time and money.
5	Had my windshield replaced today. Thomas came and did a great job. It was hassle free. He was friendly and on time which was nice. He finished fast and everything looks good. Also he noticed that the idiot who did my windshield last time glued in the rubber siding around the edge of the glass so he called and had the parts delivered on spot and fixed right away. Great service from Thomas. Good job!
