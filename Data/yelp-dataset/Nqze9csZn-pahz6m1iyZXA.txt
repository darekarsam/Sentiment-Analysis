3	Galleria Village overall is a pretty decent apartment complex to live in, it is somewhat new with a lot of different amenities. Some things they offer include, outdoor pool, gas grills, business center, exercise room, and laundry room. Beware that some apartments are adjacent to Monroe Road and can get loud at times. Monthly rent seems to be a little hire then what the neighboring apartment complexes charge also. However, it is extremely convenient to a lot of different stores and restaurants.
4	We lived at Galleria for the last year and recently moved this month. While we were there, we had only one problem which was fixed immediately. Our washer broke and they were out within the day to fix it. The community was kept up well by maintenance which was a plus. It did seem that there was a lot of turnover in the office staff. We would have stayed if after shopping around, we realized we were paying a lot for a small apartment. I feel they need to bring their prices down to keep residents. We found a brand new apartment, which is larger than our Galleria home and saved us $120 a month if we moved. No hard feelings to Galleria but it was no longer worth the money we were paying.
1	Not happy about the management in Galleria  . The apt is good but the rest is not
