5	Fantastic business. Don't need to look anywhere else- call these people to mount your tvs and install your home entertainment centers. First of all - from the owner to the employees - they were are ALL very professional and courteous. They are quick too! I had three tvs to mount in my home I just moved into and they installed them all immaculately in under 2 hours. I needed additional items as well such as a mount and 10 ft hdmi cables and they had them on their truck to sell me at a VERY reasonable price. They were very clean too! Vacuumed up dry wall and laid down plastic to reduce the mess. Also their price was very good. Much less than Geek Squad! No questions asked- I would hire them again.
