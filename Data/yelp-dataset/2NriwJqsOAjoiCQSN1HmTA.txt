5	Had a great experience with this company. Have used them several times in the past and will continue to use and refer to them. Thanks for the help! Was able to wait while they worked on my vehicle!
5	I had the windshield tinted on my BMW 528i and was extremely satisfied with the process.  My windshield had been completely tinted with 3M tint before and they were able to help me get it billed through My State Farm. So I didn't come out of pocket for it.  The workmanship was clean, the claim process was smooth. I highly recommend this company.  I need to thank my insurance agent for the recommendation.
1	Place is a rip off beware do not take your business to them terrible customer service absolutely deplorable
