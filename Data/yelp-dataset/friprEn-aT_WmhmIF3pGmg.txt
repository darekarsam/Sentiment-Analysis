4	Average sub shop with above average subs. Their hot sauce selection can add even more heat to their primarily hot sub menu. Sandwich sizes are satisfying and service is fast enough even when busy.
4	Great subs, usually fast service.  The hot sauce selection is the best part though.  They will even sell full bottles which is good as the grocery stores around here have very limited selections.
4	I never much cared for Firehouse in the past. But, they are quickly becoming a top contender on my list of sub creators.This location recently reopened after a short remodeling stint which has, as a result, increased in square footage allowing for more tables and chairs.The ladies are very pleasant towards customers, which is much appreciated and hard to find in todays society. The service is quite fast even during the super busy lunch phase. That's a plus when most of us need to travel to/fro and eat all within an hours time.Along with that fast service comes fresh delicious sandwiches. Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and try something new. You'll enjoy it. Although not a fan, this is location is equipped with the futuristic Coke Freestyle beverage contraption.
5	The customer service here is amazing! I called on a Saturday with an impromptu lunch order for 18 box lunches. Lakeisha, the awesome employee that answered the phone didn't flinch when I said I needed the lunches in an hour. I arrived an hour later and everything was ready and organized. My HOA volunteers thank you and we'll be back...with more notice next time
5	Delicious food (hook and ladder is my favorite). They are quick.  Plenty of space to eat inside or outside. GREAT service!
4	Clean, great staff good subs, even better that it right beside Starbucks. They also now take Apple Pay.
