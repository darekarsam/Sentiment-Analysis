1	I went with two co-workers here yesterday for lunch, and they gave me the wrong sandwich. I took it back to them and asked for the right food ( I HATE and cannot eat mayo, especially when it has like half of a bottle on it). They "remade" my sandwich and handed me back a "corrected' chicken ranch blt... Well, when I sat down to enjoy my lunch, i realized it was the same one... They actually wiped off some of the mayo and covered it up with ranch. There was still mayo all over the bun and in the box. I have reported them to the health dept. That is so against the law!
3	As the only McDonalds in easy distance of a business district, this location gets pretty busy during lunch time.  Where they stand out from the other fast food in the area is that they handle the line with an extra employee walking down the line of cars with a touch screen handheld.  When the line gets clogged up, someone appears to take all the orders so things get moving again really quickly.  Taco Bell and co... get on board here!Other than that perk, it's a normal McDonalds.  You know what you're going to get and that's what you get.
4	Closest Mcdonalds to me. Staff is always friendly and I think it is 24 hours. Only downside is when I ordered a large drink the other day, I was waiting for at least 15 min.
