1	As Lindsey points out, I guess it makes sense that a store like this exists. After all, it's located IN the Bank of America building, and Charlotte itself is the home of Bank of American. Still, this store is pretty weird and I can't imagine why anyone would ever want to come here, or what they would buy if they did. It's literally filled from top to bottom with Bank of America, well, crap. Bofa sweatshirts, bofa books and mugs, pencils. Anything you can think of is in the store, branded with a gaudy BofA sybol, usually in a bright, ugly color. My girlfriend points out that she bought an umbrella there one day when it was raining, and the umbrella has so far held up pretty well. I can't say that I'd ever look to buy anything else here, but I guess that other similar emergencies could emerge some day. I hope not, though.
5	I love this store. Don't go expecting something it's not - it is a BANK OF AMERICA STORE. And I have to disagree with the "crap" comment. There's some seriously fun gadgets and toys in there. These folks aren't peddling junk, but they certainly do have a target audience in mind. Worth my trip, for sure, and I'm not even in the industry!
