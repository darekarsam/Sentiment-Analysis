5	They're the best!  Last year I received my corsage from here it was amazingly beautiful. This year my sister ordered a boutonniere it was amazing. I also ordered two boutonnieres and the staff was very friendly, they helped me create a custom boutonniere.
1	Received flowers from here that died within the first two days.  When I went to the shop to ask for another set since my husband spent near $100 on the first set, the clerk said it was my fault for not watering properly.  I explained to her that I am very familiar with the upkeep of flowers and there is no way these should have died this quickly and I simply wanted to receive a new set in place of this one.  Before I knew it, the owner/manager and clerk were literally yelling at me saying it was my fault and because my husband purchased them and not me I couldn't pick a new set.  They did eventually credit his card back.  I have never experienced customer service this bad and have never been approached by such an aggressive staff as I did while I was here.
