5	I decided to visit this abc store becasue I've never been there before.  Really nice store, very nice staff.  I'm making a whiskey cake for my grandma's 78th birthday tomorrow.  So I went in and asked what the best whiskey was, and of course I know the brand to get, I didn't want to pay a lot, and I didn't want a really cheap one.  But the staff memeber helped me out a lot with the best one to get, what each of the three choices tasted like.  She was very helpful, and help me make my choice.Thanks
4	Believe it or not, the Mint Hill ABC store is pretty good as far as ABC stores go. It's clean, and they've got a nice selection. The staff isn't exactly talkative, but they're polite. If you need liquor and you're in Mint Hill, this is your place. There's not much more to be said than that!
