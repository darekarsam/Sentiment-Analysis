2	This place advertises free WiFi.......don't bother to come, the WiFi never works, it's non-existent. I have been there three times in the last six months and I has been impossible to use the "free WiFi"...other than that the coffee is no different from Tim Horton's, Second Cup or Van Houtte
2	Came here as I was walking around town and decided to relax with a coffee and snack.  the coffee was bland and the muffin was super dry.  the wifi is spotty, even though there wasn't too mny people ( about 15 ).  the place looks like it could fit at least 70 inside and about 30 outside so definitely not close to half full.  Can't imagine how it would be if it was full.
