5	I was referred to MUVIT by a friend a little over a year ago.  Since then, I have referred at least 10 people to them because thier prices are fair, they are very carful with you belongings, they show up when they say they will and are just good guys.  I highly recomend them to anyone needing to move in town or across country.
5	I have used this company twice already.  The first time, someone recommended them to me while I was moving from Atlanta to Washington D.C. and one of the employees just happened to be in the area from finishing a  move for someone else from Phoenix across country.  Although the employee needed to hurry back, they made arrangements to move my stuff last minute and save me atleast a thousand dollars.  The second time was when I moved from one condo to another.  This time my loyalty paid off because they did my move later in the evening because that was the only time I had available.  Not only that, all of my belongings were treated carefully.  They are very accomodating and flexible.  I would reccomend them to anyone.
5	My friend hired these guys a couple of years ago from an ad on Craigslist. She said she was nervous about going off a random Craislist ad, but they ended up being great, so I used them for my move.... What a great service for a great value! Damien is the owner and he was very helpful and professional. They were on time and very careful with all of my belongings. They wrapped and padded everything. They moved a full bedroom set and a couple other furniture pieces and I think my move ended up totaling $130. I would highly recommend Muvit!
1	Their customer service is terrible. I called for a quote and the guy told me to go with a different company.
