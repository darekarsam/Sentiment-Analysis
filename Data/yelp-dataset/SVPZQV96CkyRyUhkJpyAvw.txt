5	Kevin is a great guy and very reasonably priced!
5	Great service reasonable price. Will call again next time for service
5	My furnace went out this morning.  (the inducer fan shattered).  Kevin was out an hour later with a replacement and the heat's back on!  Fantastic service!
5	Kevin of Andy's Heating and Cooling competently diagnosed and addressed my HVAC unit's condensation leak and worked through an unrelated subsequent repair.  Affordable, honest, effective.
5	I've used Andy's Heating and Cooling a few times now. 2 times for annual furnace checks, and installation of a whole house humidifier on my furnace.  Kevin is very friendly, personable.  His prices are fair and reasonable. When I first called him, I was looking for particular furnace filters (which aren't sold in stores)  Kevin ordered them for me, charged me exactly what he had paid and dropped them off at my home. He really shows appreciation of his customers. Only accepts cash or check.
5	Called them late at night because of a freeze alert sensor going off.  They took the time to understand what was going on and gave me options.  Things seemed stable, so I scheduled them to come out there the next day.  Kevin was on time, professional and honest.  I would and will be using them again, if needed!
