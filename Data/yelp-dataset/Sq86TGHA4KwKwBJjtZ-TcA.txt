5	We were thrilled with our family pictures taken by Nate at TNG photography.  Nate is professional and has a creative eye for getting the perfect picture while making everyone feel relaxed and comfortable in the process.  It is not easy getting my family of eight together in one location but Nate was flexible and worked with our crazy schedules.  My favorite part is Nate is willing to travel to the location of choice without extra hidden fees.  I would recommend TNG and we will be using them again this fall for our family pictures.
