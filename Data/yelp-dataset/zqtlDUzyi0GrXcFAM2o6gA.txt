3	Home to all things cutesy and Japanese, this is the perfect place for all tweens.  This is the Hello Kitty home world, and she brought all her friends.  But it's not all just Hello Kitty, they have some Skelanimal products and even accessories.  They have purses and bags of all shapes and sizes, with the Kitty of course, and matching cell phone covers.  Even though it's not my kind of place, I'll definitely be coming back for my sister's Christmas present.
4	I was surprised by this Sanrio. They actually had a better selection of items than I had expected. I live near 2 Sanrio's in the NY/NJ area and those are loaded with limited edition products and high end imports. This store also had a few interesting Hello Kitty products, a welcome change from the more generic items at Target and such. They have a great selection of Hello Kitty jewelry,  which is my personal passion. Also lots of stickers and charms for the HK fan who doesn't want to spend too much. There's also clothes and a few electronics for the fanatics like myself who want to see Hello Kitty at home every day! I know The other store at the outlet closed down, I hope this store is around for a very long time.
3	One thing you need to know...is I am a Hello Kitty fiend! For my 25th birthday, my now husband gave me a diamond HK necklace and it's my favorite piece of jewelry! This Sanrio store is by far the most meager of any I've been to, but granted this one isn't in a hotbed of Asians like the NYC and Hawaii locations. Even so, there are a few nice touches, like the occasional Japanese import of a HK/Dear Daniel pen set or HK and Mimi liquid soap set. Would like to see more Sanrio characters and a more HK collections. But the people who work here are nice and keep the store organized.
