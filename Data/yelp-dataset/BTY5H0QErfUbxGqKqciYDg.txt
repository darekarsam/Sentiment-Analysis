5	Cactus Hobbies, what a great place with great friendly people. If you looking for a place to race slot cars in Phoenix this is the place to go.......................
1	I have never been there and I called to ask questions about birthday party package and get more information from them and their customer service was so horrible.  they used awful words on phone with me.  I have heard how wonderful and fun that place is and was sad that i had bad experience with them via phone.
3	I attended a birthday party here and it's a good idea for boys.The place is a bit rough around the edges...it's in a strip mall (what isn't in a strip mall right), but the owner really is very attentive during the party.It's a good timed system of the kids racing cars-everyone gets a turn, they rotate colors, and there is plenty of time allowed for practice, play and food.He even set up the younger kids on a smaller track so they'd be able to play as well.Don't expect luxury here..it's a room with a bunch of race tracks and some old tables, clean bathroom for everyone to use, and good pizza was served.The party host said it was very reasonably priced too.
