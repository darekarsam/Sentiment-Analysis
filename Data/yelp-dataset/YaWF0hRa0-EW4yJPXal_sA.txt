2	I've been going to this particular pharmacy for my medication for over a year. Same store, same prescription. It's an injectable and, for some reason, my doctor prescribed me a vial instead of a prefilled syringe. So, for the past year, I've been getting a syringe with each refill, no issues at all. Then, when I went to pick up my refill and asked for a syringe, I was told that I needed a prescription for the syringe. Obviously, I was surprised, as this hadn't even smelled like a problem in the past. (I haven't been able to find out what the deal is, but that's not my gripe with this pharmacy!) The pharmacist told me that she would call my doctor the following morning, get the okay from him, then call me to come pick up the syringe. This was a Thursday evening. Having heard nothing by the following Tuesday afternoon, I called the pharmacy and was informed that the pharmacist had never bothered to call my doctor and that it would be faster if I called him myself. UGH. As with the vast majority of medications, mine needs to be taken on a schedule. This woman apparently has no regard for that schedule or her customers' health. I could care less that I need to have a syringe prescription, but I damn sure expect that, when someone tells me they will call me with a solution, they actually call me back. Other than this one woman, the store is lovely. They're not busy, so prescriptions are ready promptly and dispensed quickly. I'll keep getting my medication here, but I won't be trusting them with anything other than that.
4	Our local CVS. Not much to say besides it's clean and the staff is friendly. Pharmacy staff changes and meh you get what you get.
1	Never once has my prescription been ready when I'm told it's supposed to be.  EVERY SINGLE TIME I'm told it's going to be 10-15 minutes. I don't have time to sit around and wait with two kids in the car. I so wish I wasn't pigeon holed into using this pharmacy. I miss Walgreens!!!
