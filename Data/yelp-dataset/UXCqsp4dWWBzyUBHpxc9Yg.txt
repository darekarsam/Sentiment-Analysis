5	They did an amazing job on our backyard. From start to finish we didn't have a single issue with their work. Everyone on the team was awesome, great price and beautiful work. Our backyard was completely transformed in less than a week and we couldn't be more happy with the results. I'll recommend to everyone I know!
5	Once we had decided to transform  the little patch of rocks and scrubby looking bushes at the front of our house into an actual patio space, finding the right company to do the work began. We knew we wanted pavestones, so that narrowed the field quite a bit. But who would do a good job and for a reasonable price? I checked all the home improvement  magazines thoroughly and read every word of copy in the ads to look for signs of integrity and fairness. I was impressed with the Paver Guys ads. He does pavers..... as far as I can tell, that all he does. So I gave him a call.Fast forward about a week, the colored stone he recommended was delivered to our home and the next day work began. They started around 8 am and we're done by 2 pm. 250 square feet of herringbone pattern stones were perfectly installed to replace an ugly, useless space.  They had moved all the old rock, all  the old bushes (I actually had worried they  might say that tearing out and hauling away the old vegetation was not covered  in the bid. That did not happen.) leveled the ground, put in a sand base, then cut and layed the tile as efficiently and nicely as it could have been done. The result: 100% satisfaction.From start to finish our experience was excellent. I put  lot of effort into being professional in my work, so I really appreciate working with people who express that same kind of motivation.I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family.
