5	I'll be the first to say, Azuma isn't the place to go if you're looking for any kind of advancement in avant-guard sushi with your foie gras and nitro sauces with rice paper wrapper served on a flip-flop cos it'd be ironic. The chef has been doing this for the past 30 years and this is the place you want to go to for good, traditional sushi. Azuma is a family run business with mom in the kitchen and the daughter up front. Like a five year old telling you that you're ugly, this sushi is about as honest as it gets. Please note that there was no fruit mentioned in any of the maki rolls the chef picked for us... take that as a GOOD thing.
4	Sushi here is very good. Fresh and delectable.This is not a run-of-the-mill Sushi joing where warm sushi rolls out from a machine.Apparently this place has seen the times and they do things here the old style.Love it for the authenticity I liked the Gyoza too! 'twas just perfect with some warm sake on the sideDecor is warm and service quick and friendly. I'm surprised this place has so little reviews. Must visit.
3	The black cod was incredible.  The sushi was unremarkable. The service was *unbelievably* slow (and we were pretty much the only ones in there for the first hour and a half of our time there...). It's possible that we ordered the wrong things, and should've stuck more to the hot dishes (we ordered mostly sushi, but based on the other reviews here and the incredible black cod dish, I think we probably should've gone with more non-sushi dishes).
