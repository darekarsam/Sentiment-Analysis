3	This place has everything, but I;m not going to lie...kinda freaks me out. Warning - childhood memory coming up....When I was younger my gran would take me here and she would spend ages pouring over all the creams and lotions, and all the shampoo smells and all the toothpaste qualities. So I associate Semi-chem with frustrated memories of choosing between 'berry blossom' or 'vanilla skies' because 'people can smell your hair you know.' Ok Gran.Nostalgia aside, they have a lot of stock and it's all pretty decent. This shop is pretty small and narrow, however, and can get a bit cramped. Staff are lovely though.
3	Plenty if battery's in this store and half the price than high street shops
