5	I was surprised nobody had reviewed Julianna's massages or facials on here yet... I went to her cosy little place in Dean Park Mews on a LivingSocial offer (which always leaves you apprehensive about what to expect!), the facial and head massage was lovely and Julianna was so welcoming and made you feel completely at ease. Would definitely recommend and will be recommending to guests at our Stockbridge bed and breakfast!
5	Hey Edinburgh folk. I'd like to share a fantastic masseur. Really brilliant. I can't wait to go again.  As a ex modern-ballet dancer I know a good masseur.  I'd be amazed if you can get anyone better.  Truly. I've been going a few years now. Great prices.  Super quiet place. Opening Hours  so good. It's a sanctuary.
5	One of the best massages I have ever had. Firm and strong, yet gentle. Found my knots straight away and got rid of them without making me wince. Will definitely return
