2	Wound up here for a farewell lunch for a coworker. Farewell indeed - I will NOT be returning. Granted, as a group of 15, we had a fixed menu. However, that cannot excuse the poor quality of the food at the astronomical prices they charge. For $12 there was barely a handful of salad that was soaked in dressing beside a slice of quiche that was almost all spinach to the point that the crust was soaked. Colour me not impressed. Thank heaven I didn't go for the coffee that was the only thing that came with the meal - it was brown water that you could still see through even with milk. The creme caramel that I choose was meh - flavourless and almost too gelatinous. Good point - the service. The wait staff is quite good though the first waiter did not offer pepper for the soup (which I was told was ok) as did the waitress who followed. The prices are not justified by any means if this is the quality and quantity of the food. Very disappointing.
5	Super nice staff! Helped us find a dinner reservation on a Friday night. Nice wine selection. Music is a tad loud, but still had a great time.
4	Terrific Greek salad.  Very fresh and flavorful. Somewhat of a hidden gem so terrific for business lunches.
