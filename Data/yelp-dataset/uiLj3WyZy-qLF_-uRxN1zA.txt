5	Stopped in last week to look around...  I found James to be very helpful and no pressure.  I also very much appreciated the fact that he didn't try to  "up-sell" me once i told him I was on a budget and didn't want to spend more than X-amount.  The mattresses he showed me in my price range were very comfortable!!  Thank you James and R&S!
5	Needed to buy two twin mattresses for my girls.  I called around several places and these guys were the most friendly and helpful on the phone.  The mattresses we bought were $150 each.  There are a bunch of mattress stores here in the valley, so save yourself some time and go here first.
5	Justin at R&S Mattress was great.  We stopped in last Sunday and he took his time to help us try to find the right mattress to fit our needs.  And I appreciate that he didn't try to immediately try to push his most expensive mattress on us.  He was not pushing for the up-sell.  But when we asked, he showed us what we wanted.  Our custom mattress was just delivered today by Justin & Eric.  They were quick and efficient!  And a HUGE thank you to them both for staying late to make sure we got our mattress today!  My bad back thanks you as well!  Great customer service!
