4	I had my makeup done for a speaking engagement.  It was a gift from a friend so I am not sure how much the services run but I have to say that I was very happy with the outcome! I've only had my makeup done professionally a few times in my life (minus the quick touch ups from department store counters).I wasn't a cake face mess (this was a huge fear) and it stayed all day.  I liked it so much that I even bought some custom foundation afterwards.  It was under $30 for the foundation and it looks like it will last for a long time.  I don't normally ever wear it, but I really liked the stuff they used on me, it felt natural and really evened out my skin tone.I recommend Palmina Leone, wish I could get my face done more often!
5	Have been a customer of Mary's for 10 years.  She did my make-up for various functions, cotillion, prom, senior pictures, and then years later my entire wedding party.  I always walk out looking picture perfect.  I continue to frequent her to purchase custom blended foundation (as the other reviewer mention ) it is under $30 and it is a few ounces (maybe 2 fl oz) it last me just short of a year.  It is the best bargain out there.  No more wasting money on drugstore or department store brands that don't quite blend right or cost the same for only an ounce .  I also use Palmina mascara and loose powder.
5	I am so happy with my make up consultation with Mary!  I am 57 years old and I can't believe the things I never knew about putting on make up correctly.  My make up lesson was so much more effective than any other consultations I have had at various high end make up counters.  Mary really knows her stuff and she helped me immeasurably because she really customized everything to focus just on me.  I highly recommend her to everyone - no matter what age.
