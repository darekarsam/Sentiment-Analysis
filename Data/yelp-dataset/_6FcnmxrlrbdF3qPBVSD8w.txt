4	So easy to stop in and get a quick coffee
5	This Starbucks is close to the house and very easy to find.  Located inside Bashas and the service is excellent. Very friendly people even the customers. It's great to do grocery shopping and have a nice cold or hot drink with you that is very refreshing!!! I would recommend this Starbucks to anyone who wants something fast and delicious with great service! :)
