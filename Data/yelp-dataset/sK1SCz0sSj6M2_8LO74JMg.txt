1	*************WARNING*****************************Don't use these fools!!!!We took my son's Karate Gi (Uniform) into Carousel a couple weeks ago. We wanted patches removed from the old Gi and put on a new one. After a few days we picked the Gi up and brought it home. We noticed what appeared to be green chalk or highlighter all around the patches. Also found one patch didn't get sewn in a three inch spot. Totally unprofessional job.We were furious as our son now had to wear this Gi to practice. My wife called several time attempting to get in contact with the manager. She was finally able to speak with the manager and her reply was " You should have had it cleaned". NOONE told us there would be green chalk or highlighter marks all over a WHITE Gi!!! Unfortunatly we paid in cash or I would have disputed with my CC company.
5	I just wanted to say I went for the first time to this cleaners and had a great experience. The owner Joanne was amazing. They had fair prices and I took my 5 pants, one dress, and 4 men's shirts in on Saturday and got them back Monday. They look great and I will continue to go here!  Thanks again and please think of this place next time you need  great service.
