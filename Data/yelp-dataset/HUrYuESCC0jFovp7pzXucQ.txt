5	Thanks for fixing our leaky toilet and a fair rate, Patrick!!!Seriously, this guy came down like Batman or something, and he lives right near us. We should get a spotlight with a wrench symbol and shine it in the night sky whenever we have a plumbing issue again. He's good. Highly recommended.
5	Pat saved the day. Our sewer line was backed up. We checked out yelp and found Pat. He was at my house within 20 minutes, on a Sunday. Yes his rate his higher than most but no additional charges were incurred such as a truck charge, mileage nor a holiday charge. He snaked the line and was gone in no time. He also gave us some helpful hints on the newer toilets that use less water but require some routine maintenance. Good stuff.
5	Found Patrick on Yelp and read that he was able to come over quickly -- and it was true -- he was there within 15 minutes. He was able to fix multiple pipe leaks, and did so thoroughly and quickly. I will definitely call him if I have a plumbing problem in the future. Highly recommended.
1	Used Patrick Chase once to fix a faucet and he did an ok job, very pricey. I asked him for an estimate on some additional work, and never heard from him. I called again to have him come out to give me an estimate on some other work, Today he was suppose to come out, I called to see what time he was coming and acted like he had never heard of me or coming out. He proceeded to tell me about how he was wrapped up in a job and just quit smoking. I asked if he was coming he said NO. Very rude and unprofessional. Won't be calling him again.
