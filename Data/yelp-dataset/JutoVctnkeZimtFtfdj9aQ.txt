5	Hawaiian Airlines employees are always friendly and helpful. Pleasant to deal with.
3	Don't come to the airport too early because you won't be able to check in yet. We arrived and found a line at the Hawaiian counter because it hadn't opened yet and there were no employees attending it...uhhh our flight leaves in 2 hours though! So weird of them to do that. And even after the counter opens you still have to use the kiosks before waiting in another line to hand them your checked bag
