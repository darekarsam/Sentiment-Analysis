1	Jason, you are right on the money!  Scaife is part of the ultra-right-wing bunch.  I certainly don't bemoan an individual's right to his/her politics (I'll admit I'm a little left-of-center), but this Scaife guy makes Rupert Murdoch look like Al Gore.  And your tabloid comments are oh, so true.I do give it two stars because its......oh, wait a minute.... can't think of a reason for two stars.  So I'll just give it one!
2	I wouldn't pay attention to the Trib's news coverage, since it's mostly far-right propaganda. Two stars for their decent sports coverage - Mike Prisuta and Joe Starkey are worth reading.
4	Much better than Pravda, er the Gazette.
1	This conservative POS rag makes faux news look like NPR. You got Scaife, himself pumping ten million a year from his own pocket to keep the paper up and running. No one reads it, the Post Gazette is the REAL newspaper in this city.
