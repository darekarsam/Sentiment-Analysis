5	En un mot, je m'y sens chez moi. Burgers divins, idem pour les frites ! Le staff est amical et j'y vais aussi souvent que possible. Un QG digne de ce nom !
3	What dilemma I have here. How to review McCarold's! Argh...Cute place. Typical pub decor, which is perfectly fine... It's a pub. Tasty enough food. Great beer. But....But the service! OMG the service. Is it still called service if you don't get any? And I'm not talking a Friday night here. I'm talking 3pm on a sunday. Our group of 7 was like invisible. "excuse me, can I place an order? Excuse me, water please. Excuse my, does a fork come with the poutine?" seriously, don't make us chase you for everything when the place isn't full. It's really my only knock on the place.
3	I came here once only on a weeknight. The place seemed busy for 12ish in the night. They had two rooms, and also have a terrase open whenever the weather plays fair. Staff service was fast and friendly. And the bartenders attentive. The kitchen closes at 12 but thankfully theres McD's and Timmies nearby. The only minus for me here was that they dont keep tabs and the cash only policy. Thats one of the reasons why I'm not a regular here even though I am in the neighbourhood. Crowd is young and mostly of students so I guess thats the reason why. Anyways I would have come here more often and stayed longer if they allowed tabs and at least taken at least accepted some sort of card transactions. Drinks were good and the price decent too. An okay hangout spot :)
5	I've been to McCarold's several times and will definitely be back several times more. They have a great beer and scotch selection  and the atmosphere is always friendly and chill.Their kitchen also makes great pub food: make sure you try their onion rings! They have TVs, but they're on only when the Habs are playing, which is great (I typically dislike TVs at bars).Only drawback is that you need to remember it is cash only.
