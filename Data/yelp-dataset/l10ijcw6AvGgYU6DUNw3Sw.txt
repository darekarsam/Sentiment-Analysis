3	Traveling around and it was getting late and the ole stomach was growling.  Remembered that PP was around the corner and we had a coupon.   Stopped in and it felt like we were in the middle of the kitchen..funny little set up but OK with me.  Had a pizza that was good, the dough is semi-thick and tasted OK with the sauce and toppings but the outer crust was kind of blah!   Had some buffalo wings that were good.
3	I ordered from here a few times and the food isnt bad. Occassionally they forget to do the special request I ask for my food but over all good service.
2	Ordered 2 hoagies, one steak, one Italian. $23 and some change....there was more lettuce than anything on both hoagies. One very thin layer of meat on both. I won't be back. Its a shame they're so skimpy because the bread is excellent. Could be amazing hoagies if they made half an effort.  Oh well, too many great places around to try that again.
5	Needed a quick dinner during the holiday rush. We stopped in Parma only because we were in the area. We were greeted by a very pleasant gentleman. He obviously knows about customer service!The pizza was excellent!  Great crust, very cheesy but not greasy.  Will definitely go back the next time we are in town.
5	Stop by here to check out this 20" hoagie I have been hearing about around town...its well 20" loaded...your appetite has to be big to order this puppy...all and all this is a legit authentic shop doing things fresh...i recommend this to all my yelpers!!!!...Next time I am going to get a pizza the 18" Steak Rodeo sounded awesome...but I went with the irresistible 20" grinder:):);):);):)
