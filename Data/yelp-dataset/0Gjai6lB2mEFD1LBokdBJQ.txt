5	Located inside Mosaic Salons is a wonderful aesthetician. Chrystine's large room in the loft upstairs is spacious and comfortable. The consultation on services and suggested skin care for maintenance at home was detailed and very helpful. BUT the best part by far is the actual facial I received.  She made me feel very relaxed and my skin feels amazing!
5	Chrystine is THEE BEST! Purchased a groupon for a Brazilian wax. Chrystine is very personable and made me feel very comfortable from beginning to end. I would definitely recommend her waxing services! She is #1 in the charlotte area!
5	Chrystine is great! She made me feel extra comfortable and did an awesome job. Will be back!
5	Chrystine is amazing!  I've been seeing her for almost a year now and won't go anywhere else for waxing. I had been to a few places before finding her and my experiences were extremely painful and uncomfortable. Chrystine knows what she is doing and some how it is less painful. I highly recommend her and am looking forward to my next appointment.
4	I bought a group on for a Brazilian wax and I would highly recommend this place. It was my first time getting a Brazilian wax done and it wasn't bad at all. She did a great job. I will definitely be going back again.
5	Very personable, affordable and did a great job on my wax! Made it an easy situation and distracted the pain with conversation.
