4	Most days we will bathe our dogs, trim their nails and even cut their hair. But then there are times when we are just feeling lazy. The problem is that taking them to get this done at our usual place takes far too much work - yes, you read that right. Getting the dog into the car and dropping them off elsewhere to get someone else to take care of all their pampering needs is too much work.So it is a wonderful thing that Tiffany's has opened up just around the corner from our house. We can call over - or even pop in if we are already out and about - and find out if they have an opening, and if they do we'll be there in no time flat, and quickly our little one will be returned to us looking as fine as ever.Even better is that he actually likes going there - it seems to be a combination of liking the stylists and not having to ride far!
5	Tiffany's pet salon is the best groomer I have used. The staff is very kind and accommodating to your needs like no other. Everyone here does exceptional work and always makes sure customers leave with a smile and a happy experience just like the pet. My own dog always has a great cut, never left with any lines and shaggy hairs. My dog always is eager to go to the groomer now and I have never felt so comfortable about leaving my dog until I went here. Thank you to everyone here!
