5	I love this nail shop so much! Although you should book an appt. ahead of time at  this nails salon. It has the best prices, the best convo, very friendly nail techs too! They have a very big selection of acrylic tips and special shellac colors, and hand printed designs to choose from. alright enough said try them for yourself!

1	Horrible experience ! I was referred to Diana's Fabulous Nails by a friend whose nails looked fabulous . I saw such good reviews about the prices and services on yelp, so me and my mother decided to check it out. First of all, the man who did my nails was so irritating and clearly didn't understand that some things aren't okay to say. Don't get me wrong I appreciate friendly conversation as much as the next , but some things he said we just out of line and almost inappropriate for someone who didn't know me at all . The fact of the matter is that he played too damn much. To make matters worse, he offended the hell out of my mother when he did her nails . My mom is a flight attendant, and has certain restrictions on how she can get her nails done. This man told my mother that she was "needy" , that she "asked for too much" and that she should "go back to who did her nails before and not come back." We were so appalled that we got out of there as soon as possible , I even skipped my appointment to get my eyebrows done. The crazy thing about my experience , is that he actually did a wonderful job on our nails. They looked very neat , polished well and the prices were very reasonable . But I don't give a damn who you are , you will not talk crap to my mother . I will NOT be returning to Diana's fabulous nails .
