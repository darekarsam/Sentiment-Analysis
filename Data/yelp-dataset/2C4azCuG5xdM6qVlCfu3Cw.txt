5	This wee takeaway is just at the end of our street and we've ordered from them 3 or 4 times in the past couple of months since we 'tried them out'.The portions are quite generous and the mister says the guys are friendly and service good.You also get 10% off if you order from their website. On top of already pretty great prices.They have a large variety of curries, including a bunch I'd not heard before (and ones you come across rarely).  Including a few ones with fruit, like the Kashmir with banana, pineapple & almond and the Malayan with just pineapple & almond, both of which are VERY nommmy and great for those who aren't so keen on super spicy curries.Their peshwari nann is stuffed full of almonds & sultanas, rather than some other ones you get which has hardly any stuffing at all. Also one of the few places where I've seen Okra on the menu.If you're looking for a takeaway curry. Def give Cardamon a try!!
