5	It's a perfect lunch experience. Grab a dog or two from John and sit down in the park to enjoy. He's out there Monday through Friday; although understandably not in winter. If there are any changes he'll post an update on his facebook page. What makes his food cart the best?1) The hot dogs themselves are great. Crispy on the outside, juicy and flavorful on the inside.2) He toasts the bun too3) You can order it "John's way" at no extra charge, which is where he'll spiral cut the dog and put a special sauce on it while it's grilling4) He makes his own special premium relish5) He has all the toppings you could want: onions, ketchup, brown or yellow mustard, grilled peppers...most are free of charge, some cost extra6) Prices are reasonable, starting at $2/dog, I believe7) He has a frequent-eater program - buy 5 dogs and get 1 free!8) John is the nicest guyFinding The Shady Dog made me so happy when I discovered John last summer. So happy he's back!
5	The food is great.  The first time I stopped by, I asked if he accepted cards.  I was disappointed that he didn't but he wouldn't let me leave without trying the food, even if all I had was a debit card.  The multiple times I've been back, I've had a good meal every time.  He is also great to talk to.  Very open and fun guy.  I will be back and would recommend the food in a heartbeat.
3	If you ever get a chance try this hot dog stand. Good prices and you can even get a rewards card. Does take orders in advance and has a Facebook page to let you know when they are out and about! You will have a laugh. Great if you want to walk around shady side and eat. Perfect for a nice spring summer or fall day!
