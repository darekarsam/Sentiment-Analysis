5	Mike is a mobile phone repair service, and came to my house at my convenience...on a Sunday even! My phone screen was shattered pretty badly, and within 10 minutes, Mike has me set up with a new screen and tempered glass protector! Friendly, fast, and affordable. I am big on great customer service, and Mike is 5 stars all around! Thank you and I WILL be recommending him to family and friends!
5	Fast efficient service. Mike is fast and reliable. I have used him for my iPad mini and my iPhone 5 and within an hour of calling I had new working screens
5	Mike has helped my husband and I multiple times with our iphone screen crack incidents.  He comes to wherever we are and is super fast!  Hi prices are very reasonable too!! We highly recommend him for all your iphone mishaps!
5	Mike is excellent! After I contacted him, he came over to fix my cracked iPhone 5s screen the very next day. His prices are the most reasonable in town, and he makes sure he does it absolutely right. The overall process was very fast (under 20 minutes from start to finish). I felt very safe having him in my home, and it was a very friendly business transaction. I 100% recommend this repair service over the others in town!
5	What great service!!  Mike came right to my house and had my screen fixed in just 5 short minutes!!  Not only was the service great, he was super friendly and very informative!!  I also purchased a tempered glass cover for my phone that he installed. Faster, easier,  and less expensive than you would spend at Verizon or Apple!!
