5	One of the last, old, Grande Dames of theatres,along with the Outremont, still standing. This theatre, as the Outremont, was declared a heritage site, and was consequently restored to its former glory. Beautiful chandelier on the ground floor, old world wall sculpures on each side of the screen on the top floor, which can be clearly seen from a very impressive balcony. A pity this theatre is only open during certain film fests and not all year round.

4	Originally a vaudeville theatre built in 1914, the Imperial is a Historic Monument owned by a non-profit organization and is the homebase for many film festivals that come through town. Watching a film here feels like a classy, out of time event. The lobby, the gorgeous ceiling, the balcony, all softly swoon worthy - the restoration was award-winning for a reason. It's wonderful that this place survived so many decades of change and offers such a soul-soothing space to experience the magic of movies. But they just don't show enough of them! The schedule should be packed, as far as I'm concerned, with the best modern and historic cinema has to offer, but all too often it sits empty waiting to be rented out for events. I think you could fill this place 3 times a day with creative programming involving the local university film programs and art galleries... just sayin.
