3	Its a decent Belk, but really South Park's is the best in the area and sets the bar high so the others just fall a bit short in comparison.  Sales associates are nice, there is always plenty of parking, but I tend to wander and not really find the brands I am looking for and don't buy anything.  Which I guess isn't always a bad thing?
3	For whatever reason, I do not end up shopping at Belk all that often, but when I have ended up there (or here, at any rate), I have to agree with Tracy - I end up wandering pretty aimlessly and generally do not end up finding much.I have always associated Belk with a higher quality of merchandise, and while they do have some good selections on particular items (the number of bowties they have in particular is unbelievable), it is thrown about pretty haphazardly. Not terribly conducive to be able to helping you on your way.
4	The recently remodeled Belk at Carolina Place is looking pretty fantastic.  I am a long time Belk shopper, and their red dot sales, along with regular sales, always make me happy.  The shoe department has been expanded, but I still find that a bit of a crowded mess.  For shoe shopping, I would try to come at an off time so you can get some elbow room and assistance.  I had great luck in the women's department last night and came out with a shopping bag full of capri pants, skirts and shirts for summer.  The store seems much brighter and inviting than before and they are definitely deals to be had.  The young lady that assisted me was very nice and helpful.  I will definitely return (again and again).
3	Belk at Carolina Place always has amazing customer service. They often compensate when you forget a coupon at the register.
