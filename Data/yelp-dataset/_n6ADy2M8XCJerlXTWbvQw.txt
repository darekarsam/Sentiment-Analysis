1	This was my first restaurant I tried in Montreal, I was really hungry after getting off the plane and figured I'd go for a nice buffet.  The atmosphere is nice, service is good and there is an actual cook who will do a stir fry as you watch.   The buffet is large and had many items, lots of sushi and tons of fried and sauteed food.The difference is in the taste:The bad:- sushi was old and very cold, like it came out of a super cold fridge- Food did not look fresh when I got there at the start of the service- They had a roast beef that I think I had to cut myself, but one of the servers did it for me after I asked if I had to do it myself or not, she was not pleased.- Roast beef was also almost raw and very fatty.- Noodle dishes were ok, looked old but still ok- Egg rolls are plain and fatty from oil- All the other dishes looked the same color and not appetizing.The good:- Fast service- Nice atmosphere- Took AMEX Please, please, please, Fu Lam, please listen to your customers, you will not stay open for very much longer if this does not change.Full buffet came up to 24$ with tip (water, no drinks)
