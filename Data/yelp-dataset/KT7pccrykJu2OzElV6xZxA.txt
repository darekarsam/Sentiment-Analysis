1	Competent tech, got the unit running, good response, very expensive. Charges $80 per pound for R-22 freon when the current contractor purchase price is $11 per pound. If gas stations charged the same mark up, gas would be $24 per gallon. Suggest getting other quotes Fountain Hills.
5	I just had my whole A/C replaced and wow what a pleasant experience. First of all no one wants to get this done and yes the expense is up there. These guys showed up early and got right to business. The owner even stopped by to make sure that things were on task. I have heard of these taking all day to install and these guys got it done in 3 hours. Cleaned everything up as if they were never there and explained what they were doing along the way. This is a big expense but as they left I was glad I chose Fountain Hills A/C. Great experience I will definitely be telling my friends. Thank You for easing my hesitation. I have had other companies come and they were pushy and I felt like I was buying a used car. These guys were easy going and great!ERIC B.
1	RUN AWAY. Worst customer service imaginable!  I have been rescheduled so many times they tried to give me free service! They didn't even make it to my house for THAT appointment.  Don't understand how these guys can still be in business! Please save yourself the aggravation and find someone else. Unless you enjoy taking days off of work to have no one show up!
