5	Harold has taken family photos for a Christmas card and newborn photos for my son. He's easy to work with, patient and understanding when it comes to kids and the photos turned out amazing! I also appreciated the quick turn around time!
5	I worked with Harold to take my family pics. He is so nice to work with. He has a passion for photography and really is a pro. His pictures are warm and romantic. We are lucky to have Harold in Illinois! :D
5	He did our family and baby photos. Has great ideas and pictures were beautiful! I have seen pictures from other sessions of his and they as well are very nicely done. He has a great awareness of light source and is always adjusting so that every shot is a potential keeper.
5	Harold photographed our wedding last year in Charleston. We couldn't have had a better experience! He was able to capture great candid shots along with posed family portraits. I would highly recommend him for your wedding or portraits.
