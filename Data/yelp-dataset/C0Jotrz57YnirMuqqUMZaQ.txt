5	Keiko did a good job on my 3 yr old's haircut. Price was very reasonable for a kids cut.
5	Char is great! She is always professional and very patient. She also knows what she is doing. If you ask for her, you can't go wrong
5	I would say, my first experience here was pretty good. Only downside, was the wait time. It was busy as hell!! But I won't hold them accountable for that considering its Friday and a chance that its alot of people's payday. The person who cut my here is Shawn or Shaun. Don't really know how he spell his name. But he did a good job.Now, on to the review on my barber and haircut. I know is my hair is fairly easy to cut cause its short. I usually get 2 on top and 1 on the side with a fade and clean it up with everything else. But I changed my mind and got a 2 1/2 on top and 0 on the side faded and cleaned up. All I know is he did a really good job. Took the time to cut my hair and made it look good. I mean especially for a 12 dollar haircut. And usually many barbers don't pay attention to detail. Now, another thing is I usually tip barbers around 2 or 3 bucks when I get my hair cut. But since Shawn my barber cut my hair and took the time to make sure everything look good to do it, I ended up tipping him 5 bucks and rarely do that!!!!!! Man, I know I'm a satisfied customer I am coming back.
1	I had a bad experience here. I brought in my two boys and two ladies completely messed up their hair. They had patches and it was cut unevenly.  I will never step foot into this great clips again.
