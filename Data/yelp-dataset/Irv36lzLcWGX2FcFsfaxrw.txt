5	I do work here, so I'm biased, but nonetheless, CASS is a high quality emergency shelter for people who are homeless.  This address is the emergency shelter for single adults.  CASS also has an emergency shelter for families and a dental clinic.It's the largest, in capacity, single adult emergency shelter in Arizona, for both men and women.  In addition to shelter and high quality dental services, a person residing at CASS receives individual attention through case management, employment search assistance and other site services through collaborative partnerships with local agencies.It is located on the Maricopa County Human Service Campus, a place where a person who is homeless can get get health services, sign up for Food Stamps and AHCCCS, receive counseling, attend substance abuse treatment groups, learn yoga, receive money for a state issued id and/or birth certificate, eat a free breakfast, lunch and dinner and get job search assistance, among other things.
3	I applaude orginizatons such as this one.  They provide a sadly needed service to our area.  It would be nice if our Goverment cared enough about our citizens as it does about the illegal immigrants and citizens of other countrys.
