5	Very professional and did a super job. Would recommend them highly to anyone who needs carpet, tile, or upholstery cleaning. They even have general house keeping services, but I didn't use those so I can't comment.
5	They cleaned all the carpets in the house and the tile, efficient and honest. I would highly recommend them.
5	Excellent service fast and professional highly recommend.
1	Set a date for them to come and moved all our furniture out side. Hour before they set time they called with a bs excuse and said they will come out nextday sunday. After waiting all day for them sitting on the floor they never called or showed up. Never returned my calls. I will be getting my money back from livingsocial and hope nobody ever uses this company  poor customer service.
