5	Bees just recently took over a space on Candlemaker Row, and with most of the businesses on the street if you blink you'll miss it.  So you shouldn't blink.  Bees is a wonderful cafe/bar with so much character and atmosphere it'll make you want to stay there for hours.  Naomi, the owner, makes the cakes homemade, and will pour you the best glass of Pinot Noir you've had in a long time.  Not into wine?  Bees has a list of delightful teas that will warm you up on a cold day.  Order one and sit in the lounge area in the back, covered in twinkle lights and cushions (aka. the shark cave- how awesome is that?!).  To make it even better, Bees gives a discount to hospitality industry workers.  Point of the story: Stop in and check Bees out, a cute little cafe worthy of your time and attention.  Just don't blink when walking down Candlemaker Row :)  Check them out on facebook!  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bees/197500887041504
4	Fun little cafe...Nice, funky, fresh and different...Off the beaten path!
5	Bees is a great place to study but also the perfect place to catch up with friends. It has a great hidden seating area in the back and plenty of seats in the front of the cafe. With cakes from Lovecrumbs and great coffee, it's definitely not a place to miss. Plus, it's open late!
