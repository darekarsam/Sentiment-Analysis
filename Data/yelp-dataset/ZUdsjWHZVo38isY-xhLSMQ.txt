3	Tucked in within Founders Hall, it can be a bit difficult to find. But once you do, it's a very convenient location instead of going to the actual post office on McDowell. Cash only at this place and they don't take won't break $20 bills or larger if you have a purchase that's $2 and under. Staff is friendlty and they must like their jobs because it's been the same people working there for the past four years. They got rid of the stamp machines which kinda sucks if you need a stamp or two and there is a huge line you just gotta wait it out. Lines get super long around lunch time so morning when they first open or afternoon is your best bet if you're in a hurry.
3	This place is really only convenient if you work downtown and need to mail something.  It's a bit tucked away... so if you feel like you are lost or not going the right direction, you are probably fine.  Just look for the intersection of the Optometrist office and the Jamba Juice and take the little corridor around to the post office.There are PO Boxes here too.  Just a same regular post office service offerings, just compressed in a tiny space.  It looks like the service window - which was closed at the time when I went to mail something early in the morning only holds one person so that would mean the line for this place would be rather annoying, but at least the post office is downtown.Hopefully my RSVP and my letter make it to where they are going... Gotta wait and see!
