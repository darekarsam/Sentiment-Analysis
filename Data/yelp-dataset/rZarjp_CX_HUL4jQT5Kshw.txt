4	I can do level 1 home improvements (change a lightbulb) but sometimes there is a job that needs someone with more experience. When my toilet supply line started leaking and I couldn't figure out why, it was that time. My wife noticed a Groupon for $40 for $100 worth of labor from the Kilted Handyman. This seemed like a good match.I thought I'd have a hard time getting him thinking he'd get 1000 calls because of this offer but he answered right away himself and set up an appointment the next day.Chris arrived at the time promised and was friendly and straightforward. He replaced the crappy original valve and line and showed me where the leak was. He was careful to keep his time to where we didn't owe more. But that was certainly an option i could choose.The only downside was the clock was running as he went to Home Depot to buy the parts. A plumber may have had the parts on the truck already. But for $40 I couldn't complain.Overall good experience. I recommend!PS - He did not show up in a kilt. That may or may not be a plus for you.
5	As a recent transplant from Chicago, I was looking for a great handyman and Chris is just that. He's thoughtful, funny and very thorough. I'd hire him again in an instant and recommend him to anyone needs a hand
5	Found Chris on Angieslist, (can I say that?) with rave reviews, and he has turned out to be a gem.  He is punctual, does a thorough job and is friendly and personable.  His rates are very reasonable.  He did a bunch of little odd jobs as well a few big ones, to include installing outdoor speakers.    Would highly recommend him. My only question is... why doesn't he wear his kilt?  ;-)
