5	Ok, for some unknown reason, I have veins the size of an infant.  Hence, a baby needle is required.  Now, if they had to try more than once, which, if it was any other staff housed elsewhere,  I can totally imagine a nightmare occurring along the lines of tears, frustration, anger-management courses and "The-slap-heard-around-AZ" - happy to report: none of things happened!  The girls are so kind & patient.  I don't know how it's actually possible to laugh in a bloodletting setting, but it did!  I've had blood work done about 6 times the past 3 years, and the human touch & empathy is actually alive and kicking in these quarters.  Much Appreciated!  (can't exactly say hope to see you guys soon.....)
