4	Nice sitting area! Better humidor than most shops in the area.
4	Lots of Locals...Good Friendly shop....Will go there again!!!
1	I think this place closed. There's a notice on the door that says "Notice of Bankruptcy Chapter 7"
3	They have a huge selection of B list cigars mostly. They don't have many 90+ rated smokes, including any of the Padrons, 64's or 26's. I purchased their houseblend which I intend on smoking over the weekend. The prices are fair, lower than most shops like this in California.
5	Highly recommend this shop!  The guys are very cool and fun to Hang on out with.  Great deals too!
