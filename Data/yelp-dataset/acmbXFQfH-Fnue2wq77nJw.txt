4	Great classic cut from a very knowledgeable barber. Can't beat the price or location and laidback Westcoast vibe as well.
5	Great little shop. I walked in at random looking for just a trim. Ended up getting a full cut and a beard trim. The cut was great, quick, clean and very reasonable. Patrick was great, I'll be back again.
5	Inspired by the other reviews I went by La Tete Dure and was immediately charmed by the cozy and welcoming atmosphere. I received an excellent cut, no easy feat considering my unruly thick hair. The service was friendly and professional and the price was definitely right. I will return. Thank you.
5	Had my first haircut there the other day by the uncle.  After years of going to the same type of barber, old Italian guy, and getting decent but uninspired haircuts I decided to give this place a try after reading Yelp reviews.  Am I ever glad I did.  I left it up to the barber to do what he felt would suit me the best given my fine hair type and age (late 40s).  He took time to study all the variables and then recommended a fade.  He worked on my head for over 35 minutes even though they were busy and did a fantastic job. The price is a true bargain at $15 plus a generous tip for his effort and genuine friendliness.  I have never gotten so many compliments on a haircut and feel really good about its appearance.  Highly recommend this place.
