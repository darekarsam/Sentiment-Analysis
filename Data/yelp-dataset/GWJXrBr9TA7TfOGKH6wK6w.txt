4	This food truck which hails from London is currently residing at Lock Up Coffee... serving up delicious chowder, oysters, mussels and various other seafood...as well as AMAZING.WAFFLES!!!  (Goes good with coffee... honest! I had them for breakfast..)The staff are chilled and friendly.. the decor is minimal but the food speaks for itself... Although the prices are slightly on the dear side, they are well worth checking out.. You can also opt to thumb wrestle "The Captain" for a free t-shirt... Eat there before they're gone again!!
4	Love this summer project! Friendly staff. Fresh sea food! The portions are little bit small in relation with the price, but the quality is so nice! I hope to come back next year!
