5	This place truly has a fantastic selection [especially considering it's location...sorry Bellevuers...] and they are very reasonably priced. This place is great too because it's right off 65.The guy that owns it is very VERY friendly and super helpful!
5	Amazing selection of beers from around the world, friendly service, great prices.  Other than the tiny, weird parking lot, I can't think of any complaints.
4	Great customer service
