5	Absolutely beautiful papers, cards, kimonos (could NEVER afford those) . Japanese paint brushes & paints, inks, lanterns. Wish I had LOTS & LOTS of money so that I could buy to my heart's content. A feast for the eyes and a treat for the artistically inclined.
4	Have a folding project for which you need the most absolutely beautiful paper you can find? The paper is probably here. Aside from the amazing selection of papers, books on folding and knick knacks, I think one of the best parts of this store was the calm respectful distance of the shopkeeper. Absolutely essential when you're getting your art on in your mind. As someone who likes to envision the usage of materials in my projects nothing is more essential to me than not being hovered over in shops yet having help if I need/want to ask a question. Amazing materials in this store.
4	Beautiful Japanese patterns and a wide selection of paper available.  I loved all their greeting cards and ceramics especially. I could spend a long time in the store just looking at all the different designs. Definitely a bit of a splurge on stationary but for something extra special it may be worth it.
4	Gifting paper's traditional for first marriage anniversaries, but whether you've had a ring on your finger for years, are celebrating a-year-or-something-whatever-I-guess with your sweetheart, or want to consolidate a promising friendship, beautiful blank paper is a thoughtful gift, because can be so much more. Browse through the books on paper crafts and you may find a new hobby. Take in the textures and imagine filling the pages. It's always harmonious mood at Au Papier japonais, because it validates the potential of the blank page. Which is a form of freedom in itself,  if you think about it.
