5	Located downtown, call Dr. Greg and he can get you in that day, sometimes within the hour.  He's a cool guy, very friendly, and not a new-age, hippy, sales-y doctor like some of the other chiropractors that I've been to.  Accepts insurance & FSA...if you work downtown, I recommend him.
5	Clean fast and the dr is great.   Highly recommend.
5	Dr Greg is great! Staff is very friendly as well. HIGHLY recommend them to you if you work in the downtown pgh area
5	Dr. Greg is "amazing"!!!!!  He does not talk down to you.  He remembers your name after the first visit.  His communication skills are superior as he explains things in a normal friendly way. He is not egotistical at all   He will have everyday conversations with you.  He often will stay open a little later if you need that last minute appointment.  Very professional. Excellent at what he does.  Doc Greg has definitely been a big help with easing the pain in my neck and upper back. .
