4	Went to Uptown Art with a girlfriend this week and had a blast. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. There were only the two of us, so we basically had a private lesson.They have tons of paintings to choose from- apparently they have a database of several hundred different pictures.
5	I went here for a girls night out. We brought our own vino and had an awesome time! Everything was set out so it was easy even if it was your first time there. I arrived with my group but you left feeling like we were part of the entire group. They took a group photo of everyone's art and helped you along the way. We're already talking about scheduling our next event there.
5	Came here for the first time with some girl friends this past week and it was a blast! The instructors and those helping are all so wonderful and helpful. I love how they encouraged all of us to paint our own painting, not make it exactly the same as everyone else's. I will be back!
5	We celebrated our birthdays and it was great.  Instructions were easy to follow and the instructors encourage your creativity as well.  Love the place
