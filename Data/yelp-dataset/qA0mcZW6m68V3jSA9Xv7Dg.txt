4	So this is basically a standard gas station and mini mart with one notable exception... It also includes a full service post office where you can buy stamps, send letters, ship packages, etc. and all without having to wait in line at a regular post office and deal with the bad attitudes of US Postal Service workers.If you need to ship packages, this is the place to go and for that reason alone, this place gets my recommendation.
5	This gas station definitely needs some love. First of all, I am so happy it's now a Shell! Secondly, there is a US Post Office shop inside the store and third, it's quick, efficient and always feels safe. What more can I say?
5	This is a five star gas station for sure!! Better wine selection than walgreens, and cheaper.  Cold as well! Ready to open after a long work day;)... They also have a POST OFFICE!!!!! I can not tell you how happy this makes me.  It's full service!  So far there is nothing that they couldn't do the same as a regular post office, and the lady that is always working is sweet and really helpful!! This is a hidden gem for sure... I love their selection, love their prices... Love being able to get my mail done while getting gas... What more could you ask for???
