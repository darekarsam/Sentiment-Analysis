5	Great people. Clean bathrooms. Very nice and friendly. Very helpful.
4	Great selection of informational pamphlets. Also everyone is very professional and nice, understanding that you are lost in a sea of culture and activity. There is a primary host who can answer most questions in a couple languages or route you to one of many specialized attendants. The bathrooms are quite clean and there is also free wifi! There's a gift shop too that isn't too pricey. Downstairs there is also a cafe with a little more selection than a starbucks to give you some umph to get to your next destination.
5	For a first time traveler in both Canada and Montreal, this information center was above and beyond in customer service for me. I came in here with just the intention to pick up a subway map and a map of the city, but I was surprised to see many attendants bilingual in French and English assisting so many visitors. There is a huge selection of maps, brochures, and information for both Montreal and the rest of Canada to choose from. There are assistants available to help book bus tours, shows, and other accommodations. The attendant that we saw asked my boyfriend and I what our itinerary was and helped map us out (highlighter and everything) with corresponding bus routes and metro stops. We also purchased our weekend transit passes through him. We never felt rushed during the whole process. He made sure that all of our questions about the city were answered, which was really kind of him.Other amentities include: a full service cafe (wasn't open when we visited on the weekend), bathrooms, free WiFi, and a small tourist gift shop that sells stamps (big plus!). This information center is open 7 days a week. This center is a worthwhile visit for any visitor before embarking on their adventures in Montreal.
