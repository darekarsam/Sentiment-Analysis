4	Ment to do this review once I also got to try the rice pudding but alas that proved unfeasible and I was not able to sample the deliciousness of what is rice pudding. Otherwise I popped these guys First-customer Bubble tea cherry as Jen L. put it haha, the gents who served me were first class and made my bubble tea and were nice about it when I changed flavors three times . They were made me laugh when they watched me try it, curious about how it was since it was the first one they made. I told them it was delicious but needed a little more sweetness to it but other then that it was excellent. I had the Taro which if your wondering is a type of root native to the pacific if I am correct. Its especially popular in Hawaii if any of you who read this have been there I recommend it . Back to the review though, its was very tasty and the tapioca pearls were nice and chewy. I hope these guys open a shop somewhere were I can be a customer and get one of my favorite drinks in the world. And if you guys do read this review , if you really want to do well with the bubble tea sales, I recommend making them into a milk shake style where its blended and thicker. I promise you won't go wrong this is how bubble tea shops in parts of America make theres and they sell like Hot cakes! Otherwise excellent bubble tea and I am sure the rice pudding is even better!
