5	Great service and fresh food! Super bacon!
2	Chez Cora has a great name, and a great franchise. Unfortunately, with franchises the quality can start to decrease. In my opinion, this is what has happened to Chez Cora. I've been to many Chez Cora's in my life, for the most part they are all the same with the exception of how long or how short the food is cooked for. I really used to enjoy Chez Coras, but now every time I go I am always disappointed. If you are in the mood for a breakfast that is pretty decent, with a lot of different choices, then definitely give it a try. If you are very critical of food, and really enjoy eating great food, don't waste your time here.
1	Service is really, really, but really bad :'(  our waitress came to our table once to take our order 25 min after we arrived, no coffee. I had to stand up and served it myself . then the food came 45 min after we ordered it and our waitress did not give a fork as I did not have any utensils.
