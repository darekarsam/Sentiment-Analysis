5	I just want people to know if you need real estate assistance why I use Gentry Real Estate Group and in particular Spencer Caldwell.  I started a house flipping business at the beginning of 2014 and planned on buying 6 homes my first year and I'm already at 8!  Spencer finds the properties - whether it be at auction or on the wholesale market.  Gentry's access to great deals on properties in the State of Arizona is unparalleled.  Ryan Murphy is our Gentry Real Estate Agent.  He markets and sells them for us, quickly, profitably, pleasantly and at a reduced commission.  Gentry is a full service broker with great people, knowledge and business ethics.  I wouldn't use anybody else.
1	The 5 star review on here must be from a blood relative, because this is the biggest group of crooks I've experienced. I moved out of the house in spotless condition but was charged a ridiculous cleaning fee and a $400 re-listing fee... Even though they didn't need to re-list it because I found them the new tenants! Complete jerks when I confronted them about these charges. I'll never do business with these thieves again, and hopefully you'll steer clear too.

They made a video of the home, making it look beautiful and since I was searching from out of state, it seemed like they were so helpful. And then I got to the house. Discovering it hadn't actually been cleaned in 8 months. There was so much wrong with it. They lied to me about the condition and the HORRIBLE neighborhood it was in! Then when I tried to get out of it they took $900 and said it was non refundable. As soon as I said we didn't want to live there they stopped the kind service and stopped caring and stopped responding. Not worth it!
