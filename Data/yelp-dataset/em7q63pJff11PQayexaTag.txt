5	Rick gave me a pretty mean haircut - he's a seasoned barber with years of experience...I grew up near Blawnox but used to go to Vic's in A-wall because of the old-town barbershop feel, and that's what "Colonel Rick" is trying to go for with his (newer) place in Blawnox.  He's quite opinionated and you can have a good conversation with him so long as you show respect, in which case he'll show you the same!
5	Great shave, great conversation.  Rick is cut from the old cloth of how men should conduct themselves. Highly recommended.
5	Rick's is awesome.  Old school barber shop - quality haircut and shave at a great price.  I am in town for a wedding went to the sports clip down the road (bad idea) and they totally butchered me.  I went in - Rick fixed me right up.  Haircut and a shave.
1	Rick is a racist that has no tolerance for other races or religions.
5	Rick's is great.  I'm in town from CA for a spell and want a proper classic Barber Cut, not a chain, and not a hipster.  Though there's nothing not hip about Rick.Great cut, great conversation.  Hot towel.  Price is right.BTW, Rick related that the guy who called him a racist asked to have a swastika cut in his hair, and as a former Marine Colonel, there's no way Rick's gonna do that.Sorry I didn't get a shave.  Next time.
