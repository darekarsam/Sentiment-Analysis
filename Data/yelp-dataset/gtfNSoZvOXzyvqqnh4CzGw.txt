5	I swung by C&M yesterday because I was fresh out of incense.  So I got me some incense, turned left, and was greeted by the most amazing snack food stand I'd ever laid eyes upon...For a mere $5, you too can own and indulge in a bag of Deez-Nuts brand mixed nuts.  C&M sells Deez-Nuts, therefore, C&M gets a 5-Star rating.  Oh and did I mention their slogan ("A Party in Your Mouth") or who all the proceeds from each purchase benefit (the Troops)?I don't smoke cigarettes, but the "and More" was more than enough for this nut.  5 stars.
4	As a smoker being in Tobacco Road I'm always looking for a good deal.Can't beat the prices here.We spent about $44.00 for a carton of cigarettes.Small little shop located in a shopping center.They also sell hookah pipes ,loose tobacco,a small selection of cigars on the smoking side.On the beverage side they have a small refrigerated area with beer,water, wine & soda.  Snacks are by the register with scratch off lottery tickets. Just hope I don't have problem getting 4 cartons of smokes back home through security at the airport.Prices are almost 2x more expensive back home in New Jersey.But in retrospect, if I lived down here I would probably smoke twice as much.
4	Great little tobacco store. I roll my own ciggs for about $1.15 a pack (yep, that cheap) and found very good prices on tobacco and cartons of cigarette tubes. My ciggs taste exactly like Winston's used to taste before they started adding all the chemicals. 15 minutes to make a pack in front of TV.
