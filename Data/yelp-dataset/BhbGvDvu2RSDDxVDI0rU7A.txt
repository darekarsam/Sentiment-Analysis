5	Great place to train. Huge space, clean, knowledgeable trainers, and very helpful/friendly athletes. This is a competition level gym, but welcomes everyone. Great addition to the Lebo community. Highly recommend.
5	Friendly atmosphere and great coaching. I would highly recommend this box to anyone looking to CrossFit in the area. The box has a nice feel to it and they have great equipment. The running area is open and safe and they have more than enough room to toss weights around.
5	Awesome coaches, badass tunes & free Saturday class. I'll be back! Really great class and box!
