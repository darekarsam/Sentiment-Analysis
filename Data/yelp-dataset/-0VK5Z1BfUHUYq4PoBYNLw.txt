4	A quaint little showroom bar in the Tuscany Hotel & Casino. Plenty of oversized comfy lounge chairs.On Friday nights, Kenny Davidson take over the joint (10 PM - 2 AM). He has singers from a variety of Vegas shows take the stage. This is one of the best free shows in Vegas! No cover and cheap drinks. There is a little bar tucked in the corner and the bar tender is from New Orleans and made me some really fun, down home drinks. This lounge was not overly smokey.Fun spot.
3	I'm not sure what they normally host here in this spot inside the Tuscany, but I came here for the World Series of Karaoke. Inside, it's fairly small. There's a tiny bar immediately to the right when you walk in. Then there are small tables with chairs (all facing forward towards the stage) and some seating along the back wall. The stage is small, but nicely lit and whatnot. And it's height proportional to the room set-up.The sound quality was good. It never was too loud. And everything was clear.There are cocktail servers who come around to each table. And they make the rounds fairly often.All in all, it was a good time. However, compared to other similar places around Vegas, this one pales in comparison.
4	The World Series of comedy is AWSOME ! Very funny , had me laughing all the way home. Drinks don't come to often due to all the people but it's very good.
4	Located inside the Tuscany Hotel Casino. This is a small and intimate music venue. It's nice to see a live music place in Las Vegas, so many places have done away with them. some night there is a two drink minimum, this is my one complaint, not the minimum, but you have to order both at the same time and by the time you get to your second drink it's watered down or flat. But still worth a stop by. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
