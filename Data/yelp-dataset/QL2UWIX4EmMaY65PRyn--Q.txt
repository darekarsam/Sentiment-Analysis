4	It would be easy to miss this little cafe amidst all the hubbub of Jean Talon Market, but if you are looking for a tasty, quick, inexpensive option for breakfast or lunch in the area this clean, simple little cafe with its big front windows and terrace looking out over the vegetable stalls is a great choice. There is a daily sandwich deal that gets you a coffee, sandwich of the day and small salad for under 7 bucks. The filter coffee is always strong and fresh and there are dozen of roasted coffees from around the world lining the back wall - including some great fair trade options - if you want to grab a bag to bring home. The breakfast sandwich with egg and cheese is peppery and yummy and the bread is always very fresh. The almond croissants here are delish as well - they pour the almond paste all over the top of the croissant as well as in the middle so it forms a buttery sweet almond crust. The pear chocolate muffins are wunderbar aussi.
3	I think my friend is starting to love the Cafe Latte in Montreal... no for the coffee itself but for that rich milk froth...While we were walking around Marche Jean Talon, all she kept wanting was a coffee... that's how we ended up at Cafe In.This place is crowded with table set so close together, I can barely move around with my winter jacket on... or maybe I ate too much bagels while I was in Montreal??Service is quick and efficient... with this single barista running the place. I just sipped on my black coffee while my friend when hmmm and ahhhhh with her frothy cafe latte... I really want to tell her how fattening that is......
