3	Great clips is great for easy haircuts such as kids and men's hair.  The great clips app helps to checkin online and tells you your wait time. This is an awesome app.  This place is also almost never busy and stays open late and is close to home. Only thing about places like this is if you find someone you like that gets your hair type and cuts it correctly. It's only a matter of time before they move on. These places seems to be Launching places for any decent hair stylist.
5	Well, I've never had a haircut that really worked for me until I went to this place. Sandra initially cut my long hair into an angled, stacked bob. I've been back twice more since then. It's close to my house, they stay open late and the service is good. I never though I'd be writing a review on this place but I was so impressed by my haircut...especially when strangers stop me just to look at my hair. Also, this place is NOT busy so the service is quick. That's always a plus for me.
1	Getting my hair fixed.  Right side is 1 to 1 1/2" longer!Time to stop paying for "quick and easy" and get a real haircut from a real stylist. Nice people.
