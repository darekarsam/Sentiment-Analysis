5	A truly wonderful grocery store. The meat and deli section is worth the visit alone. They have a fantastic bakery. Not speaking French wasn't much of hurdle. All the staff was polite and friendly. Americans may be surprised by the prices, sometimes as much as 30% higher than what you might pay at home but you're not in America, are you? Great selection, pleasant surroundings, what more can one ask.
