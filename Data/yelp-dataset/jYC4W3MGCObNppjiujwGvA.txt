4	No, it is not the best supermarket, but I'm giving it four stars anyway. If you are Chinese and miss home, this is a must-go. They have so many things that will ease the homesick feeling. The best part, besides the selection, is the prices. Asian veggies are super cheap for a giant bag and you can get black sesame ice cream there. Asian snacks and Vitasoy are also here and they don't charge for plastic bags, which is handy.I just wish it wasn't so far away, but it's not such a bad commute. I see students shopping in there all the time! Parking may be a bit of a hassle though - there's a parking lot right across but it's pretty damn sketch.
4	Very good Asian supermarket, which packs in an excellent collection of fresh, frozen and packaged goods. Some items may be familiar with Western customers but many are not, including some exotic fruits unavailable or hard-to-find elsewhere. Prices are very competitive with the major chains. The only drawback is the fish odor which can be overpowering. Parking can also be a challenge.
4	Are you kidding me? Accept CC? This is a Chinese grocery store, man.
1	Should be able to assign a negative rating.Horrendous conditions. I had to leave I couldn't take the smell and I am not a 'queasy' type of person, so this is remarkable.Raw chicken parts to the open air and customers sorting through with their bare hands.Fish open to the air also. Can just imagine what this must be like in the heat of summer when the door is opening and closing.Deplorable atmosphere in general...Wow.Cannot believe this is allowed....I have read the Public Health reviews..and cannot understand why no citations have been given in a year's worth of monitoring...First and only time.
