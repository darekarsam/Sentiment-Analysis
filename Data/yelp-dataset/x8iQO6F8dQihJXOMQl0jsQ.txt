4	This is the Goodwill store that used to be around the corner in the same shopping mall but with the McClintock address. I believe it moved about a year ago to this location which is a larger store.I've actually had pretty good luck at this Goodwill recently.  I've been here on previous trips and have come in 3 or 4 different times this trip.  I always find some things that I can use or that I like. It's not the closest one to me but if I feel like driving that direction then I will stop by, especially on the 50 percent off Saturdays. One bonus is it is next to a Sprouts Market, the Arizona Art Supply store, and across the street from the Coldstone Ice Cream. This last time I was in here I stopped into the Outback restaurant for lunch, a place that I had never been to before. The store seems to be clean and organized, as much as it can be with all the people that go through messing it up. The prices are not too bad, though all the Goodwills are not as reasonable as they used to be.  But on the half price Saturdays every other week you can really do well.
3	I'm going to breathe fire and stomp you all becuase you price vinyl at $2.99 instead of $.99. Really picked over all the time because of the college being so close.reviewer MaryLou D. Seems nice. I would let her ride on my back and I suspect she carries snacks in her purse which is pretty neat when you think about it.
5	Very clean and organized! Workers were pretty friendly. And I thought everything was priced decently.I even found one item that didn't have a tag, and she just charged me .99 cents. When it was certainly worth more.Great deal for me!
