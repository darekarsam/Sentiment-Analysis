4	Victor is the one man band of this barber shop. He set my appointment and did a great job on my hair. Garnished in minimalist decor, the shop doesn't have a lot of flash, but it does have a big comfy barber chair and a sink in the corner. I enjoyed chatting with Vince and felt really comfortable getting my "ears lowered" here. He seems to have lots of repeat customers - even ones who will stop by to shoot the breeze. Being a New Yorker, Vince is a straightforward kind of guy and you have to admire someone who opens up a business on their own. With a fresh cut and a dab of pomade in my hair, I left looking and feeling like a million bucks. Go here instead of Supercuts or another chain salon to get a real barber shop haircut from an experienced stylist with an eye for detail.
5	I have been a client of Vic's for over a year and can unequivocally recommend him for all of your styling needs. His experience results in the most consistent hair cuts that I ever received for the right price. The vibe is laid back East Coast with a California surf shop element which puts you right at ease the minute you walk through the door. Vic's rapport with his clients is obvious from the conversations that ensue when there is a short wait. Many have been coming to the shop for years. Great product, great price and a great guy working his trade will make you want to come back on a regular basis.
5	After running around Arizona looking for someone who knows what they are doing I found Victor. I went through at least 4-5 barbers until Victor cut my hair. One chopped off more than I asked and others just didn't work out. Victor takes his time and does a great job!
