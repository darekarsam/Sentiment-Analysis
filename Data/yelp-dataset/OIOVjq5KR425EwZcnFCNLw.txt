1	Great bartenders.   Tight machines.  Players benefits going downhill.  Must leave all VIP dinner food at restaurant.  No take home on leftovers.  VIP dinners aren't so VIP.  Non VIP customers treated better.  Shrimp dinners are a joke.
3	Been here a few times on a Friday night to watch a friend of ours, a regular customer, play Keno at the bar. Local patrons are friendly and bartenders have been very attentive. Best mixed drinks I've had at a smaller local casino. Food from their deli was fast and affordable. Cool place if you don't want to drive far from home.
3	I'm local and saw part of the infomercial and decided to try the place. Club card benefits are average except when you first sign up. I like smaller casinos and this has a good mix of new & older machines. I didn't win much but my spouse had good luck. We used coupons to eat at the deli and liked the food. I had the breakfast special & spouse had a burger. The burger was tasty, tomatoes & lettuce fresh and the fries were really fresh & hot. You can't do much harm to eggs, toasted muffin & sausage and it was good. We'll go back & see if it's consistent.
