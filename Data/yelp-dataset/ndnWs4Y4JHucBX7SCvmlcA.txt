1	Don't waste your time with JMK. There are many other options for landscape maintenance in Henderson. Their communication was terrible. Getting a call back took and act of God. Their pricing is competitive but in the winter months, cut their service to once a month, yet continue to charge full price. All in all, just a poor experience with this company.
4	We used JMK Lawncare for general yard clean up, weed spraying, tree trimming and the trimming of a rosemary bush.  We were very pleased.  I called JMK early in the week, and by that Friday I had an estimate.  After agreeing, they got the job done before 11 AM the following Monday.  It was less than a week from my first contact to the completion of the job.  We've had a few lawn companies come out, and the prices of JMK were in line with what we paid these other places.  The yard looks great, communication was fantastic, and the prices were competitive.  I absolutely recommend JMK for lawn/yard maintenance.
2	I have been using the service for a year - the prices are reasonable and competitive with other companies & when the guys show up my yard looks great.  The company downfall is HORRIBLE communication with its customers.  There is a huge lag time (like weeks) in return phone calls or emails, and the gardeners arrive at random times. If you make an appointment they will NOT arrive on time.
