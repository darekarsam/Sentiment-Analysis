5	One of my favorite circle K s to watch for crazy things
1	Nothing irritates me more than gas stations with no public restroom.  I KNOW YOU HAVE ONE IN HERE SOMEWHERE!!!!  It's not like the employees use the wall behind the store right?  Oh wait, that's exactly what the guy at the desk told me when I asked. I figured, well fine then, to the alley behind the store I go.    Big mistake. Tripped on a jacked up corner of the curb and almost fell right onto a couple of bums who then proceeded to ask me for bus change.  No thanks, I will take my bladder elsewhere.
