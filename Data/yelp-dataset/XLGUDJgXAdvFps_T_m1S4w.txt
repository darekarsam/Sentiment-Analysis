3	Take your USB pen in, wait a few minutes and your dissertation or lengthy essay will be copied, stapled and even bound in an instant. Quick and efficient this copy centre is ideal for getting your work printed out in time for that looming deadline.One word of advice, don't use the service to print out small amounts of work (2-3 pages) as they charge a minimum amount for any print. I found this out the hard way.
3	I stumbled onto this place by accident, I wasn't intending to find it, but when I was wasting my time walking about the DHT before a lecture, I found it! The DHT copy centre is a place where many students have no idea exists, indeed it is only really students who stand in elections or are needing their dissertations printed that know of its existence! With its late sixties/early seventies decor, it's incredible that the DHT copy centre actually has computers and photocopiers! Photocopying and printing are cheaper than other places within Edinburgh but I would advise not to use it for small amounts of printing as you would be cheaper doing that in the library or in the Hugh Robson building. The one thing I have noticed over the years is that the staff are helpful but have probably got so fed up of students over the years that they aren't the friendliest bunch at times - at who can blame them!
