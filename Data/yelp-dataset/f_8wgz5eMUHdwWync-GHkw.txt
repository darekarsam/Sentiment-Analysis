4	Every time I've ever been in here this place has been really busy.  Most of the time when I'm here it's for morning coffee.  In my opinion, DD has some of the coffee out there, bar none!  I love their coffee and the donuts!  I always try to stay clear of the fattening donuts and sandwiches but I can't resist the coffee (cream and sugar)!
1	I went here to place an order for a very important meeting the night before our meeting.  I ordered 6 dozen donuts and pre-paid for the order.  I told the person taking the order I would be there at 6:45 am.  I went there the next morning and was told my order was given to someone else.  What the heck?  No apologies. Nothing. I had to wat for the order and was late for my large company meeting. We were going to order on a weekly basis, but DD lost out.  Get your act together.
1	This place is ridiculous! The people who work here are literally retarded. If you like dealing with morons with an IQ rivaling a garage door opener, then this is your kind of place... But if you expect a person to be able to make coffee and put a donut into a bag and hand it to you.. Then your definitely barking up the wrong tree here.
3	This location has moved across the street into Hunter Crossings! Their address is incorrect and unfortunately I was traveling so I hope a local can update it!Their new spot was nice, large, and had some flat screens with the news on. Pretty standard for a Dunkin Donuts. I was bummed my munchkins weren't fresh tasting at 8:30 AM in the morning.Wifi was SLOWWWWWWW. And wow, the location is really buried in the middle of a very long strip mall, which makes it somewhat of a PITA to get to.
5	Best D & D in Charlotte! Great staff at this location! They do a great job handling the big crowds in the morning.
