1	I just purchased over $3,000 worth of furniture from this place. My complaint is not with the furniture, but with the extremely incompetent people and generally shady-ness of the store. Of course, they promise you the moon to get you to make a purchase, then fall short of delivering on any of those promises. Ordered a bedroom set and mattress the Monday before Thanksgiving. I was told the mattress would be delivered on Friday. I just barely received the mattress 10 days later. I am still waiting on my bed frame. Almost sent ALL the furniture back due to crappy customer service and being lied to several times. But the manager called me today to set up delivery time. He told me previously that they would wave the delivery charge for all the hassle. Today he pretends like he has no idea what I'm talking about. Please, steer completely clear of this place! I will be call the BBB as well.
1	We ordered 3 bedroom sets and 2 mattresses from this place.  We were told we would have our furniture within 7-10 days. The delivery guys have been here 3 separate times now, to drop off random pieces.  The first time they came, they brought the wrong sized beds.  Now, almost 3 months after we bought our furniture, we are STILL waiting on a dresser.  90 days is a far cry from 7-10 days.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	Ordered furniture on 12/15/14 for my wife on Christmas. They said that 90% they could get it by Christmas. It's 01/02/15 and I still don't have my furniture. They also tell you they will deliver at a certain time and it doesn't happen. I have many family members who buy furniture and will not be recommending this place to anyone. I understand they couldn't get it buy Christmas but it's almost been a month since I ordered the furniture. There is a reason why people go to the big furniture stores, it's because for the most part they can deliver on there promises. This store did deliver on one of there things, THAT WOULD BE THERE WORSE REVIEWS!
