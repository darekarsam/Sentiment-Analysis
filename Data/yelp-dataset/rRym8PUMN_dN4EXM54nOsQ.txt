1	This place is absoloutly horrible. The seat thee fell apart. The theatres are absoloutly disgustingly smelly and dirty. Some theatres smell like urine. This place needs to be shut down.
1	DON'T GO HERE! No heat in the theaters - we froze! Bathroom sink broken, paper towel dispenser broken, very poor assortment of refreshments.
3	It's hot as hell in this place!!!
1	It's unfortunate that they don't charge a dollar or two. The quality if this theater is in par with dollar theaters. Goodyear needs a quality theater!  Both dirty and poor quality sound.
3	School is in session...1. You have to charge regular price to rent the movies to show them. Theaters only profit off concessions. 2. Yes OLD.. Very old... never dirty or smelly3. The AC and heat do go out from time to time but they have always told me before I pay for the ticket, and it is specific rooms, not the whole place.4. You have every right to mark what you feel. Base it off what is important to you. I just so happen to go here because annoying movie ruining teenagers are non-existent. If you want a new theater, go to one that is filled with those5. I have watched four movies here with just me and the wife in the theater, super awesome!
