3	This is the much smaller sister club of Super Sexe.  It really felt as if they built a strip club in a walk-in closet.  There's the standard $5 cover, but during the weekdays they have a free buffet until 5pm.  The "dance space" includes a pretty small stage (only fits 10-12 seats) and, if memory serves me, 3-4 private booths in the back.  Some of the girls rotate through both clubs.  The one time I was there, a Sat. afternoon in '09, they only had 4 girls "on duty."It's not a bad club, but due to the size it will fill up pretty quick on a weekend night and become uncomfortably crowded.
1	OMG, I swear some of the girls were  in their third trimester!  I'm not sure if it's just a Canadian thing but no one was tipping any of the girls!  I felt so bad for them.  One of the girls walked off the stage looked at us and said "clapping is free".  lol!  run run run!
3	Came here on a saturday night after coming from club/bar downtown was packed. We went in to see how busy it was, and it was moderate, so we were able to sit on pervs row. I would say out of 10 women, 5 were hot. I got 3 dances from Nicky, who was probably the most gorgeous girl I've ever laid my eyes on, and that's an understatement. Lap dances are $15 a piece full contact, cover is $7 each, and beers are $9. The private dances are located upstairs and the entire place is poorly lit. They didn't hassle us for lap dances too much. Also, do not throw anything less than $10 on stage, or they will kick it back to you. Two of the hottest women I've ever seen worked here, and I guess I got lucky to see them both on the same shift.
2	First time watching strips dancing. The entry fee is 5 dollar and the beer is 8 bucks. We have waited for more than a hour till other customers coming. The dancers were not focusing on dancing
