4	I loved how open the store was, great selection! The area for classes was huge and able to accommodate lots of people. It would have been nice if we were asked if we needed help or if we were finding everything alright, or even someone to come up to us and let us know about the sales that were going on. Even a "hello, welcome to wood creations" would have been nice to have. The lady who checked us out was very nice though, but that was the only interaction we had with an employee, and there were 3 of them working. Other than that it was a very nice store,  and even though it is a 50 mile round trip for me, I will definitely be back!
5	Great quick, helpful service. So glad I found this place .
