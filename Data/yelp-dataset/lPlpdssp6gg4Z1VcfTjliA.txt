5	SAWSAGE!Who doesn't  like tasty sausages? Well vegans and vegetarians probably..but OH WELL.The black Swiss sausage is my favourite, which funny enough was our "one free sausage" the first time we went here...we bought it in bulk on our next visit.They also have a nice selection of local beer, but since HoMa has so many great beer stores that doesn't really matter much...it's all about the cylinder shaped meat contraptions. SAWSAGE!
