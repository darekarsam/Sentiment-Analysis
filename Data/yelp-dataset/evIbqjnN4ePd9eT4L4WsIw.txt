5	I attended a fundraiser here this past weekend for two local men who are currently serving in Afghanistan. I have also been here several times to drink and watch the hockey game. Every time I have had a wonderful experience, between the friendly bartenders and the great priced drinks. This weekend was especially nice with all the things they had going on to raise money. There were numerous raffle baskets, 50/50 drawings, door prize giveaways and catering from a local restaurant. I had a great time and would definitely recommend this place as a small, friendly neighborhood bar to catch a game or drinks with friends.
4	If you decided to move next door to a bar, you'd want to move next door to this one. But you can't, because I already did. And I'm not moving.
3	Fun bar, but if you aren't a smoker be prepared for your eyes to burn and your clothes to stink like cigarettes when you leave!The usual Miller, Coors, Bud beers are cheap. No food. Just drinks.
