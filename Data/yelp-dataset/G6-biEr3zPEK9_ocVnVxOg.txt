5	Just had the Chilaquiles at Viva Mexico. Fantastic, having flashbacks of Oaxaca. Will be back for dinner soon!
4	I stopped in yesterday afternoon for a snack of Tostada de camaron & sangria Senorial.I loved the colorful decor and the personal service. The flavors were fresh and vibrant.Despite being in a semi-basement very light and airy feel due to use of large windows and mirror.If I find myself in that neighborhood I might drop in again.
