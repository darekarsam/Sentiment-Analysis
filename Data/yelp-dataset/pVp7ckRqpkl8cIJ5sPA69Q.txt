5	We used Agape Turf for the installation of artificial grass in our back yard. These guys are awesome. The grass they used was Fescue and it looks like real grass. Everybody that's come over to our house immediately thinks that it's real grass. Even our friends who have fake grass in their yards say that ours is much better quality! That says a lot about Agape's service and quality. Their installers and sales reps are 100% professional and were very easy to work with. If you want to eliminate a bunch of yard maintenance or trying to keep your real grass from dying I highly suggest thinking about artificial grass / turf for your yardand use Agape Turf. They by far have the best grass in Phoenix.
5	A+++... We found Agape at a home show, and they installed artificial turf, a putting green, and travertine tile in our backyard. We are extremely happy with their work! Excellent, professional contractors and high quality products.  We just went through monsoon season with our new yard and it drains beautifully.  Looks just like new.  We get compliments from everyone... HIGHLY recommend!!!!!
