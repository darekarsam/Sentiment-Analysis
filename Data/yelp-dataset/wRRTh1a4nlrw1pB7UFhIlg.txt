3	I was having a leisurely wee stroll up Dundas Street back into town when I had an overwhelming urge for caffiene. This happens often. Then further up the street I spied what looked like the oh so friendly artisan roast symbol on a board a few metres up the street. Deal.So this little coffee shop, or cafe or whatever it wants to call itself is really rather handy. They have delicious Artisan Roast, as I already mentioned, although the staff don't seem too confident in their coffee making skills which is a bit of shame?! The sandwich and Pastry selection is maybe a little sparse, but other than that this little joint is exactly as yelp tells me - A-OK.
5	Possibly the best flat white I've had in Edinburgh. Unassuming wee cafe which is now open Sundays which is great news!
