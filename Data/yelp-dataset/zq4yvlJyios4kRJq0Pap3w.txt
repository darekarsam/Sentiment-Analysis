5	We moved to Matthews in 1987 and bought a new house. The heating and air conditioning units had been installed by Custom Comfort. Whenever we have needed repairs or replacements we have used them. They are prompt, their prices are fair and I trust them. They won't try to sell you a replacement unit if your current equipment can be repaired. After 25 years of great service I wouldn't think of calling anyone else.

5	Purchased a home in June. To my surprise there was no air conditioning on the second floor of my home. Due to the age of the home there were no easy solutions to remedy the problem. After calling on approx. 13 different HVAC companies, they were the only ones that were able to come up with a reasonable solution to fix the problem. They were very professional, courteous and efficient. There price was fair and they fixed my problem. For any AC or Heating needs, I highly recommend them. I will never use anyone else for my HVAC needs!
