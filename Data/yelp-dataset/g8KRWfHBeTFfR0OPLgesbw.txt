4	The Furnace Creek Ranch is a nice place to stay, with comfortable lodging, bar, restaurant and shop. A general recommendation is to come early in the year, maybe in April, when the furnace is not on yet and there are yellow and purple flowers covering the desert ground. Perfect place for sightseeing tours to the surroundings. If you want to stay at the Ranch there are opportunities for horseback riding, there is a museum where you can learn about the hard times when the first settlers (49ers) came in the mid of the 19th century, and how borax was mined and transported by mule carriages. Outside the museum there are a lot of installations, carriages, an old steam locomotive etc. from that time. Everything is a bit expensive there (e.g. the restaurant) which is probably due to the quite large distance of the Ranch to the next city (Las Vegas? 150 miles?).
