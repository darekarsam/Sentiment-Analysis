5	Great place to eat, Lemon Chicken is the best in the world. Many entrees available.Portions are always big. Kids meals are big enough for a 300 lbs man. Fresh Bread and oil given at start is awesome and I am sure you'll be going for seconds. Price is very reasonable. We did a private party there too...great service.
2	The food was pretty good. We ordered a bottle of wine, but we only received two glasses of wine. However, when we got the bill, they had charged us for a bottle. Despite this, we managed to have a decent time. Their pasta was quite oily and I found that the lack of variety in the menu was appalling for a restaurant of their calibre.
4	Really enjoyed the good from this joint. Even though we only ordered take out and never actually say in the place I must say the food was mighty tasty. Very fresh ingredients and very full of flavour. Price wise, it was great. A must for italian food buffs!
