1	My friends and I stopped here to eat on the way back from Prescott. First of all, the cashier never greeted us. I ordered a char grilled bbq sandwich by itself,  and when I told her that she had to get her manager to punch it into the register. My two other friends ordered specialized meals and they messed both of theirs up as well.It took 10 minutes to complete my order and 15-20 minutes to complete my friend's orders. They messed both orders up and they had to be remade, tacking on another 5 minutes to the order time. Overall, the service there was horrible and they couldn't understand simple instructions when we ordered the food. Other customers in there looked like they had the same issues. The manager on duty didn't look like she knew what she was doing, so that didn't help the situation at all either.
1	Ordered a few meal we where the only ones ordering food. The guy had to be reminded twice for my daughter shake which she never got til she was done eating cause he was too busy playing around with his co workers
