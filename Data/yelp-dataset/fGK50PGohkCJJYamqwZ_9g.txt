4	Small cafe admist all the highrises in Uptown. Good selection of food for breakfast, lunch, and snacks. The service is super friendly too. They've got other things you may need in the office if you forgot something at home. The 4 stars for me came from the Watermelon Nectar though. It is incredibly refreshing on a hot day. It's watermelon juice, coconut water, mint, and nectar. Also, checking in will get you a free scope of ice cream which I'm always a fan of. They had a good selection of ice cream to choose from too so it actually made for a tough decision.
5	I work just above this cafe. This a quick place to grab lunch or breakfast for a reasonable price. Daily lunch specials a plus! Wes and his crew are all very nice people. Try the honey badger wrap if it happens to be on the special menu. It is very tasty!
4	I work across the street and this little hidden gem is the best! It's inexpensive (well by downtown standards) and the quality is great!I get their BLT on sourdough toasted - Huge slabs of bacon, bread toasted perfectly. All the contents in this sandwich are perfectly proportioned (add hotsauce)Pasta salad - nothing too special but it's still delicious. It's an antipasto salad with th right about of meat.Get their breakfast sandwich on a croissant. It's the perfect thing to start the morning with. Whatever they have on special is always delicious. I've had their gourmet nachos, buffalo sandwich and roasted vegetable quesadilla.They also have snacks (i.e. chips, granola bars, candy, pretzel and cheese). It's the perfect little spot for a quick lunch.Tip: Call ahead and order for pickup!Their customer service is impeccable! They seem to remember everyone by name! Or maybe they're just reading all of our name tags haha since the majority of their clientele are office workers.
