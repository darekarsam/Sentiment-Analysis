5	I loved it and would definitely return! It's a cute quirky neighborhood restaurant.First off - the utensils are set with a sock. There are stocking manniquins that serve as flower pots. If these don't weird you out, you should def check out!Menus are photo albums (cute). The above mentioned sock (weird). Food = great. Table for 2 shared 6 tapas and 2 desserts. Tapas were brought out two at a time and they were all delish. We had the foie gras slider (small but well endowed), the tuna nicoise salad (yum), smoked salmon (winner), the blood sausages (OK), beef tartar (yum) and the escargot (OK).If I weren't a tourist, I'd go back and try some of their other menu items.On a side note, we went after we went to the olympic park. We didn't realize it would take full 20-25 min to walk to the restaurant. There are buses from the station though that would make the commute shorter. :)
