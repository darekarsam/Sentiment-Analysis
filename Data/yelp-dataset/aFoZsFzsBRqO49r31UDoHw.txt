5	This place is as good as it gets. The facilities are clean, the staff is friendly and the workouts are challenging. We decided to become members of Precision because our kids.  This is the best program a child can get into if you are trying to improve their self-confidence, personal discipline and respect for others. It nice hearing your 1st grader say "Yes sir!" when you ask him to do something.
