4	Great selection and presentation of fireplaces with friendly services.  Services personnel are knowledgeable and offer good tips.  Definitely better to look for options for fireplace than Home Depot or Lowes.  They offer traditional wood burning, gas, electric, and ecosmart fireplaces (the ones often shown on HGTV).
5	GREAT service!  Jeremy Brown came out to review a client's fireplace and he was amazing!  He went above and beyond and will definitely send them more business in the future!
5	Today Jason from Arizona Fireplaces came out to inspect our propane fireplace. We had moved into the house 3 months ago and wanted to be sure everything was operational. Jason was very thorough, explained how the system worked, cleaned the inside, checked the wires, cleaned the spark igniter, laid down some new ember material, and fixed the small leak we had. Jason answered ALL my questions I had and was very professional and honest. I will recommend Jason from Arizona Fireplaces to anyone who might need their services.
