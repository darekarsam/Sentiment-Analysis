5	Dr. Doubrava is my eye care specialist.  He is an excellent physician.  I have been here for several yearly exams, and I stop in more often than I should because I'm always doing something to break, damage, or otherwise inhibit the lifespan of my glasses.  This is usually a hiking induced problem.  The office has a registered optometrist, Melissa, and she is top notch.  She has come to my rescue on many occasions.In short, Dr. Doubrava's office is a one stop place for my eye care.  I appreciate him and the staff and will continue to stop here.
5	It was such a pleasure to go here! I had, or am still having, a rather bad case of Pink-Eye. After going to other doctors, and even the emergency room which was nothing but a painful experience, I finally found this business.Doctor Mark Doubrava was not just very nice and competent, but went out if his way to actually run after my car since he discovered something that could be related to my eye infection! Have you ever seen that? A doctor that actually cares for his patients!I will definitely go back here and have my prescription for my glasses renewed.This business is a role model for all other doctors in this State!
