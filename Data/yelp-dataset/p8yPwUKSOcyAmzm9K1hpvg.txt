5	So it's been two years since the last review about the Brossard location and I'm happy to say that I loved this place! Although i've only ordered the jerk chicken meal. Comes with flavourful rice topped with some plantains and beans. The Jerk chicken is really well seasoned and tender. I stopped by the shop by chance and have been back three times!!! Take a leap of faith and try it the jerk chicken meal! So good. One thing is the coselaw, just regular (try switching it in for another piece of plantain).
2	I gave this just two stars because of a few reasons. 1. Their decor isn't very good, if they had decided to leave as just a store similar to M&M, maybe it could have been better.     2. Their food is decent. I found, after going there a few times, that the food is stale.
