4	The have such beautiful abundant presentation and pannini sandwiches for $5
4	Walk in.  Keep walking to the back where they best burger in town.  The place is fresh, clean and filled with excellent serve-yourself drinks and salads. Yum.
3	Salads, soups, sandwiches, paninis,  and various hot dishes to eat there or take out; all laid out as to hot or cold,  Vegetarian friendly, comparatively-priced fare. Good for those on the run.
4	I've become a fan of this place far from my home back in Dallas, Texas...at times it reminds me of home when they cook a breakfast for me early in the morning.  Not because of the location...but, because they actually seem to care about what they serve their clients which is a quality home styled cooked meal..., and that's why it reminds me of home at times.  So, if you're at the the Train Station...stop by and give them a visit prior to going on your voyage.  :)
1	their chicken burger used to be a great choice in getting.now they barely cook the chicken breast making it cold and wet in the middle...ive been sick from it before and gave them one more chance after. much to my prediction, it was again under cooked.im thinking of reporting them depending on how sick im gonna get after this last attempt.
