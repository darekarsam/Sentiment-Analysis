5	Elevation is a wonderful church! The music is top notch and rockin, and the messages are simple, to the point, and from the heart. The atmosphere makes God alive and fun and real. Its nice to not feel like I'm fighting sleep when in church.
5	Another location of 6 locations of Elevation Church!yeah and this one is kind of like in a warehouse space, someone said it is like going to lasertag but with a concert and a preacher teaching a positive message, it is real good but the accoustics are more like a concert in a warehouse, they give you earplugs if you want, it is loud
