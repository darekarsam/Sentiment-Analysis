5	Best place to buy a car! no credit needed! I got mine here and it built my credit and now i have a house from it. Best Place ever nice cars nice people! Best used cars ever it even came with a free 1 year warranty and free gap insurance! Very happy! Low down payments too.
1	These guys are unbelievable!  All I wanted was a price on a vehicle and after giving them my information like a fool, they have done nothing but bother me saying that all I need is to have proof of income, down payment, eight references! and so on and so on.ALL I WANTED WAS THE PRICE OF THE VEHICLE AS I WAS GOING TO MAKE A CASH DEAL.  I DON'T NEED THEIR HIGH INTEREST RATE FINANCING.Unreal.
5	Awesome place to get a ride! Best buy here pay here I have ever bought from! Rave reviews! Top notch!
1	No help at all, they were just sitting in there office and didn't even greet us. They had no idea what was on there lot when I was asking about prices.. Came out here from Mesa and it was a waste of my time. Horrible customer service!!
