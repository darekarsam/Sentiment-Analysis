5	Great new place in Cave Creek!  CCOOC's website boasts that they have "the highest quality oils and balsamics from all over the world."  Well, I love both and have done many tastings so trust me when I say, they have a great selection of the best oils and balsamics I've tasted! Everything was so true to the label; bold and flavorful. This will be my new go-to place when I want quality o & b!
5	Bought some olive oil and balsamic vinegar while visiting AZ from WA and had it shipped. The postal carrier tossed it on our porch and broke the balsamic vinegar bottle. I called and Rich shipped out a new bottle free of charge right away. Customer service is incredible, and Rich was great! Thank you, we will be ordering from Cave Creek Oil Company in the future.
5	This is a fabulous shop - I've bought several bottles from them now, and can say that truly these oils are the real deal, not over-processed, over-pressed, too-young oils; these are rich, and full-flavored, whether deliciously accented with butter, shallot, garlic etc. or pure EVO. The balsamics are every bit as good and while the flavors certainly can stand alone they combine in so many delicious ways! Rich and Martha will let you taste anything and have great suggestions on combos and cooking. Healthy, light, delicious, EASY way to add fabulous flavors to so many dishes. If you have never used a flavored balsamic or EVO I promise it will change the way you cook! Check out the honeys, candles, and ceramics while you are there too - great gift ideas! (Try the avocado lemon oil with white fish with just a light drizzle of balsamic over the top just before serving - so quick and easy, no more boring week night dinners, and you look like a pro!)
