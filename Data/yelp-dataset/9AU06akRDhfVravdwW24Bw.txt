5	Very impressed.    Extremely client oriented    Called ahead to schedule the full package detail.  Made every effort to make sure we were pleased.   Very efficient but very detailed   Exceeded my expectations   For the level of service they were underpriced We will take all of our cars there from now on even for a everyday wash.   This business will do well.  Every employee cares about their quality of work.   They enjoy their jobs from what the customer can see Great job !
5	Sly's is the best.  A regular car wash is almost a detail job at a regular car wash.  It may take a little more time than a machine wash, but if you like a clean car, it's worth it.
5	It is now called neat freak car wash. I took my Honda accord in to get washed and the inside detailed. It was very well priced and the customer service exceeded my expectations. I will definitely go back again.
4	Let me say this first, this is the best value car wash on the planet.  For $25, my car is immaculate.  They cleaned between the spokes on my wheels, they did an amazing job on the interior.  Truly 6 star worthy service.  The only reason i am docking points is that there is no building in which to wait for your car to be cleaned.  This means you have to sit in the shade outside and wait for your car.  No A/C or fans to keep you cool.  Minor annoyance, but today was real hot (108) so with no breeze in the shade its about 95.  I would rather deal with the heat than all of the upsales that happen at other car washes.  I will be taking all of my cars here from now on though.  Highly recommend. Another note:  I saw cars there that had been detailed.  They looked better than new.  Everything from the undercarriage to brake calipers were spotless.  If i ever need my car detailed, i know where i will be taking it.
