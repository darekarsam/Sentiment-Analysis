5	Came here instead of Starbucks to get some much needed study time... It's too hot for coffee.. Close to my university ... Has all things berry healthy... I personally ordered the Berry Fulfilling w a free energy shot... Free!! I'll take berries and free any day.. My drink : all berry and only 150 mere cals..& filling.. Actually felt like dessert.. Awesomely sweet staff..
3	consistant service.  No bells or whistles to keep me from going out of my way to get to this location.
5	Great service and great smoothie!!  Yummy!!
3	I love this place but i had a shot of wheat grass and was not as good as the locations in Campbell California. It was small too and the orange was frozen that was given with it. When I tried to bite it was all ice and hurt my tooth. Good thing I'm only visiting. All your locations should have the same products and be just as good!! Service was great though and very welcoming! Might just want to check your grass!
3	I usually stop here after volleyball because oddly, I am always craving a smoothie... I think it's because I still have the adrenaline going and the AZ heat factors in...The staff here is always great as there is about 1-2 people but I am sure it doesn't get too busy... I am always provided friendly service and the smoothie is delivered to me quick and yummy! I have no complaints about JambaPrices are okay too for the quality3 stars= I am a fan!
4	Got an Acai Antioxidant and Mango Go Go here before and both were good.Drinks made well and quickly, plus the service is great the workers usually walk out from behind the counter to hand you your drink which feels a lot more personable.Prices are typical and they have changed their sizes to Small, Medium, Large so it's easier to order. This location is a good size and there's tons of parking.
5	Love this Jamba Juice :) The guy who took my order was so cheerful and happy! He made the atmosphere felt really nice! He also gave as a discount!
