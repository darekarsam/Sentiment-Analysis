3	I don't know why, but this Bruegger's stands head and shoulders above the location three blocks away on Grant.  Employees are almost always in good spirits and much more efficient at taking orders.Like most Bruegger's, they have the standard Bagel, Sandwich, Soup, Coffee and Tea selection.  They also have nice booth seating along an outside window.
2	Service was slow and the bagel sandwhiches were lacking.  Plus they did not have any of the special that they were advertising.
2	I have tried this Bruegger's several times since beginning my job downtown this spring. I generally get takeout, eat at my desk, and then feel extremely disappointed afterwards. I have ordered the egg, cheese, and bagel sandwich a couple times. Even though egg sandwiches constitute nearly half of the menu, I think the eggs taste very fake and spongy. Not only is the food mediocre, but so are the employees. They act relatively depressed to be working at Bruegger's.
3	It does the job, but it's nothing special. The amount of cream cheese added can either be fabulous or lacking.. it all depends on the person making it. It's always busy in the morning. Waiting in line for a sandwich takes forever. Anyone who is just getting coffee cuts in the middle of the line, making the time to check out seem forever. Last week, ten minutes surprisingly wasn't enough time to grab a bagel and coffee :( I was late to work.The blue apple salad is realllllllly good however- grilled chicken, green apples, blue cheese, cranberries & peanuts(?) maybe. It's been awhile but i remember a crunch in there besides the apples ;) .. Their champagne dressing is divine!
