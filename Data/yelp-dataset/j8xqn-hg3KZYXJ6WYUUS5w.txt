1	What a nightmare. Do not use them. I scheduled a cleaning and no one showed up or called. My voicemail was never returned. I called later that week and allowed them to reschedule for the following Monday. I received an email 30 min before my appt canceling the appt. Ridiculous!
1	Unfortunately, I would not recommend this cleaning company.  I had them clean an empty rental house for a flat $150 fee and only 1 person showed up (young college age girl) and she probably worked for around 3 hours total.  I would grade her cleaning at a 5 out of 10 - found several areas not clean after she left.Then, my credit card was charged 5 separate times for $150 within an 8-day period!!!
1	Can I give less than one star?I purchased a Living Social to try their cleaning service.  Sam, the owner, confirmed the date and time by email but did not show, call or return phone calls and texts.  I am requesting a refund from Living Social and wish I would have checked YELP before wasting my money.
