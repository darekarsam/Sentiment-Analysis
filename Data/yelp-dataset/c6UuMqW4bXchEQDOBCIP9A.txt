4	This lounge is great for drinks while watching the live music. It's right in the middle of the hotel between the entrance and the doors to the lake which offers for high ceilings and a very open-aired feeling even though you're inside. Decent wine list for a hotel.
4	Live music in a very open area. I'm trying the MaryMartini. Bloody Mary Martini mix, ooh yum.  Very tropical feel even though we're in the inside.  I'm really digging this resort so far.
4	The only reason i did not give this place 5 stars is because i came on a Thursday, when there is so music, entertainment, etc, which is what i was looking forward to. With that being said, this place is quiet, romantic, cozy. I sat out and looked at the lake. Around 730 in the middle of dinner,the fireplaces turned on.. adorable. Chicken Caesar salad was simple but delicious. Burger was amazing. Cocktail was not too sweet, i enjoyed it. The bartender was helpful and relaxed. The server was attentive and sweet. Definitely come on a weekend to get the full affect.
4	This great little bar is located in the lounge area of the Westin at Lake Las Vegas.  We bellied up to the bar to enjoy a few drinks and some food.  Jon was a great bartender and just happened to be from my husbands home state.  Yes there was much for them to converse about!We tried their crab and spinach dip. It was served with warm naan bread.  The dip could have been a bit creamier.  It was just ok.  We also split the burger and fries which was recommended by Jon.  The burger was fantastic.  Very juicy and cooked to perfection.   I'd get this again.  Overall it is a great bar with a good food menu.  On the weekend nights there is a dj playing for a few hours!  Thanks for the great service and food!
5	Really cool bar/lounge. Hasan was very friendly and made great drinks. I liked his twist on a few of the menu items.
