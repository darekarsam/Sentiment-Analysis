5	I was doing some work at Rouge's studio and Carol grabed me and said "let me fix your eyebrows"  I was amazed at what a big difference it made - It gave me an instant mini facelift. Don't be visiting Carol if you don't want a free makeover!  Mary Beth - Mint Hill

5	I have been going to Carol once every 6 weeks for over 5 years now. I can tell you honestly that my skin looks better than most ladies my age....45. I clean my face every night and moisturize, but Carol's facials and dermafile treatment have been my saving grace. I strongly recommend!! You will not be disappointed!!
