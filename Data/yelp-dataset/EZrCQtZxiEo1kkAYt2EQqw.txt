3	I love Wendy's in NC they have the Carolina Classic sandwich
1	Worst wendy's I have ever been to in my travels all over the USA. Normally Wendy's is at the top of my fast food list. This particular location is HORRIBLE. AVOID !!!
4	3x. So far so good.
1	I have been to this location maybe 10 times in the past few years and every time I go through the drive through the order is wrong. No fries, no salad dressing with salad, no fork, and the last straw was at the bottom of my chili bowl it was about a 6in piece of paper. Avoid!!
1	All I wanted was a quick burger to take out, and I never got to even order. Sunday night at 7 PM shouldn't be peak dining time, but the drive thru line was 10 cars long. So in to the lobby I went, and waited in line inside rather than out. I waited, and waited, then waited a little more. After 5 minutes without getting closer to the register, I gave up. That was enough for me. In the end, I probably added a year to my life skipping my order anyway.
