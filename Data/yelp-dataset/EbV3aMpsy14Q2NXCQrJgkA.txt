5	Eric did a incredible job on detailing my car!  It was such a mess both inside and out.  He made my car look BRAND NEW!  He is very meticulous and would definitely recommend him for a professional and detailed job!!
5	Just had my BRZ detailed this morning. Eric was incredibly punctual (showed up a few minutes before my 9 AM appointment), and was very easy to work with. He's one of the nicest people you'll meet, and the attention to detail he puts in his work is borderline OCD. I purchased an exterior Wash Wax detail with some leather trim maintenance for the interior. This was the first time purchasing services from Quality MD, but it will definitely not be my last!
5	This place is awesome. I had bought a few mobile detail deals on Groupon and living social. I paid full price for these guys and they were awesome! Service was quick and it was officiant.
