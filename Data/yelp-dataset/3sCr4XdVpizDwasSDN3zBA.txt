5	This is a nail salon I stumbled across while I was eating at Skillets one day. I got their signature pedicure called fresh lime pedicure, it was wonderful!! I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a clean friendly staffed salon instead one of those that rush you out the door!
4	Next to that sweet lil' place, Think Chocolate, is Bubbly Nails. What a cute name, no? Way better than Nail Spa II or Good Nails or all the other junk people name their nail salons, I think!Either way, it was a dark and stormy Tuesday.... and seriously it was. So when I walked in about 6:30 there wasn't a customer in site and the ladies jumped to pamper me with a mani-pedi combo. I went with the gel manicure and was SUPER impressed. They care OPI shellac and not only does it come in 25+ shades but the manicure truly did last 15 days. (Disclaimer: My last attempt at shellac lasted 4. I work with my hands at my job and it's tough to keep polish on, no matter what you do!).The services took a little longer than normal which I enjoyed - a true pampering experience! The salon was clean, well lit, tastefully decorated and had the latest and greatest looking pedicure chairs for your enjoyment too. Definitely my favorite salon in Ballantyne and maybe in Charlotte!
1	Half my nails were filed square and the other round. They don't know what they are doing. Waste of money.
1	Wish I had read the other reviews before visiting this nail salon.  Everything said is accurate - my nails were not filed evenly, most were at an angle, and the polish was horrible!  It was so thick it couldn't dry, which was done with a fan rather than a UV lamp as in most nail salons.  I asked to pay before they painted my nails, but they asked me to wait, so I had to dig into my purse with thick, damp nail polish.  My nails looked so bad by the time I got home I took the polish off and repainted them myself.   DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PLACE!!!!
