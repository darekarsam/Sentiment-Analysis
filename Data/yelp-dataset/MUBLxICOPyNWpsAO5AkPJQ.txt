5	Was referred to this location for an MRI (was having foot pain). My appointment time was at 8am and they told me to arrive 30 minutes early to fill out paperwork, so I did. Upon arrival, they gave me a one-page health survey to fill out, which I did and within 10 minutes they had called me back to the testing area. They had me put my purse into a locked locker (of which I held the key for), and took me into the MRI suite. They had me lay down on the table, and even gave me a blanket as it was a little chilly in the room. The MRI took about 15 minutes to complete and I was out of the office by 8:05am (just 5 minutes after my scheduled appointment time). Perfect. The employees were fabulous and I have zero complaints. Hope I dont have to go back for more testing, but if I do, I'll gladly go to this location.
3	Didn't have the order for my test when I arrived. They say they didn't get it, dr's office said they sent it??? Who knows? Average service and wait times.
4	Probably the quickest I've ever been in and out for an x-ray, ever. Staff was nice and the small wait was nice and cool with plenty of Today Show on TV.
4	These people are friendly. I only give four stars because it said it was a breast center on the front door, and I did not see a single breast.
2	This place is odd. You get therefore your point in time and you sign in. Then you sit around for who knows how long until they call you up to then take your insurance information. Meanwhile the receptionists will sit gabbing away. What are they waiting on? The new usually move to the second waiting room or you could wait another 30 minutes or more. I don't get it. The South is pleasant but their system is broken. Why when I walk into the office and no one is at the check-in  (everyone sitting around) and have to wait to go check in. Then you realize all these people are still waiting to be called up. Not happy. Its my 2nd time here and same same.
