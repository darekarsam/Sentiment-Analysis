5	Awesome vet!  Definitely recommend it to everyone in the area.  Have always taken great care and patience with my German Shepherd.  Dr. Burnette is great with animals and very upfront with us.  I am moving and it is sad to leave this place behind as my dog has always been in great hands.
5	I love this vet, not only are they the most friendly staff and Vets I have ever met but they are caring and they love every animal they care for. Dr.Green and every vet that has taken care of my Puffin really do enjoy their jobs, and it shows! Puff actually likes going to the vet, it's like he knows once we get on the highway that he is going to Mallard Creek and he gets really excited! I live down town and it is a little bit of a hike for us to go to the vet, but I still go and will only go here, honestly I can't think of any other vet I would choose! Thank you to all the staff for your help and care for my family's dogs! :)
5	Knowledgable, kind and caring staff.  There is no dreaded 'back room' that they take your pets to, everything is done in the exam room, so you are able to be there to help keep your fur baby calm and as comfortable as possible.  The Vets are the ones who trim nails, express anal glands, and all that fun stuff- which I think says a lot about the place. :)
5	We just saw the most awesome vet here. They were amazing, the appointment was quick, and most importantly the vet very clearly cared about our dog. Within about 30 minutes he was able to determine he had a torn ACL and prescribed a pain reliever for him, and then we were out of there!Also very good pricing at this place. If you're in the area, there are a few animal hospitals, and this is definitely the one to come to. We tried VCA Stoney Creek and besides being pricier, they were beyond rude and cold. This on the other hand was an amazing experience for both us and our pup!
