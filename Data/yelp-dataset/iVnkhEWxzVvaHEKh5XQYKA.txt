2	I came here reluctantly when a friend of mine insisted that we 'branch out' when it comes to going to clubs, which was a fair point, me and my friends did seem to be caught in a student bubble where we ended up going to the same old clubs on certain nights.Instead of going to the trusty Potterow on a Saturday night, we agreed to come here and I ended up regretting it. It seemed pretty rough inside and there was a real range of people who come here- mostly under-aged drinkers or those whose clubbing days should have been left behind them a long time ago.The drinks were however pretty decently priced, which is good as drinking a lot is probably the only way to actually get a good night out of the place. I doubt I will be leaving the student bubble on a Saturday night in the future.
3	Mood is keeping me awake many nights! I am sadly the only member of my flat whose room faces the lovely by day (and extremely annoying by night) Union street which is just adjacent to Leith Walk.Walk past here any Friday or Saturday night after midnight, and you will marvel at the debacle that is the British party animal. I still haven't adjusted to the odd, albeit amusing, behaviour, and girls' dressing which is quite oblivious to the weather! I feel like reminding them, that we are in Edinburgh, it is past midnight and a handkerchief paired with stilettos is just as unhealthy as it is distasteful. Rant over.The club itself has some live music nights from time to time, and the music is pretty standard chart stuff. All I know is that it's loud, but I can't exactly walk over in my Pj's and ask they crank it down a little.
2	If you're seeking quality in the music scene then SORRY guys MOOD is NOT your party destination !!!Having recently  relocated it self to the old GHQ night club, MOOD has persistently devalued it's reputation with the poor quality events it's been putting up...  The venue at most  looks like a lounge; the sound systems are nothing special;  there's no WOW feature in the club, and among the nights I was there, the music was noting more than the stereotyped commercial chart songs...                                                In  overall;  If your up for a stupid night out, with drunken, messy and potentially over-aged people, then yes do not hesitate to enter the club! If not,  trust me guys you have BETTER OPTIONS out there...
