5	Even though I have lived in Brookline for over 13 years now, I have never really felt like a local. And you know how when you're not a local and you walk into a small local bar, there's that distinct record-scratch moment when everyone stops talking, maybe a glass breaks behind the bar, and every single head in that joint rubbernecks to gawk at you, giving you a judgmental, precursory once-over?Well, that has never happened to me at Zippy's. In fact, I have always been treated exceptionally well - every single bar tender I have ever encountered there has been extremely accommodating and made me feel like I belonged there. The service is quick, the drinks are cheap, the people-watching is prime. Other patrons have engaged me in friendly repartee every single time I've visited (which admittedly isn't often enough). Zippy's is definitely the type of bar I'd take my out-of-town friends to give them a real taste of the local flavor.
1	in a few words : narrow-minded yinzer bar .smoky, full of brookline local yokels.i've tried to like this place but , no, sorry .you're better off walking a bit further up Brookline Blvd. to the Brookline Pub which has better beer selections, a better atmosphere and isn't annoyingly painted black and yellow as in case of zippys .
