3	Just came here for a drink on a Sunday afternoon and it was just all families taking their elderly parents out for some food. Certainly wouldnt go out of my way to come back but it must be handy for people who live nearby as there's no alternative! The menu also looked like it made more of an effort than your standard pub food.
