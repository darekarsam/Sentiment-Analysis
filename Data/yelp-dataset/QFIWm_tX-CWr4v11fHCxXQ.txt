5	This is a family owned business that rocks! Glad I ran into Kenny, this was my 7th transmission to go into my offroad truck,  I can beat on it with piece of mind!-Shawn
4	The check engine light on my Ford Fusion came on in the early afternoon on Christmas Eve. Most repair places were closed then. But as I was driving by, I saw some people outside KB's. Technically, they were closed, too, but they agreed to run a diagnostic. The code came back not serious. They refused to accept payment.
5	These guys are honest and very reliable. You won't find a better shop in Phoenix. And by the way Kenny rocks. He only fixes what's broken. Highly recommended
