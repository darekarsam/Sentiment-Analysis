5	My amazing husband found this restaurant when he was looking for a French place in the area of the Montreal apartment we always rent when on vacation.  However, if you are staying somewhere else, it is definitely worth a trip to this cute neighborhood and great restaurant.The restaurant is intimate (I counted 13 2-tops total), with one bright yellow and blue room, and vine-y plants hanging in the windows.  Get the full menu... for only an additional $8, you can have a choice of entree (meaning appetizer) and dessert added to the main course of your choice's price.  My favorite was my daughter's duck done two ways.  My son also had an amazing ravioli with duck confit.  I started with the snails (perfect texture, neither chewy nor mushy) and had the mixed grill, which was also delicious and perfectly cooked.  My husband had a salad with gizzards, which doesn't sound like something you want, but believe me, it really is.  Desserts were also impressive.  The wine list, not available on the website, is on a chalkboard in the restaurant.  Most bottles are in the $35-55 range, with many glasses available from $7.5-9.There was one cheerful waiter (he's actually from France) serving the whole place and making it look easy and fun.  And I think the chef/owner cooks everything himself.  We got to meet him at the end of the meal because a big table of 8 people requested him to come out while everyone was finishing desserts.I will definitely return, and this restaurant will replace L'express for us...it is also an excellent restaurant I have reviewed here, but Jurancon is much more charming, and the food is more adventurous.
