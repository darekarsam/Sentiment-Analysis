2	The times I've eaten here, the food was so-so. Meh.
1	Whats better than over priced chicken of all things....I guess because, they give you that great service and drop it off at the table never to be seen again.  I do not get it..has anyone ever counted the dirty plates on the tables?Or the bathroom so nasty that you barf from urine smell.? Now they say they have BBQ? Come on BBQ? where is the smoker? In the back of a food truck?that rolled in the pre cooked ribs?               I just do not get it.. What is Boston about it? And what is Market about it?
2	Slow service and the people serving food don't seen to be in a hurry at all to help the customers. I guess bad management.
