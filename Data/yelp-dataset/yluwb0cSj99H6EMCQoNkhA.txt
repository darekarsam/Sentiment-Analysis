3	This is the sort of place that you come if you like wine, but aren't like, really into it (well, I come here and I'm not exactly a connoisseur). Basically, what I'm trying to say is it's cheap, and it always stocks the 'coolest' brands and has almost always got a good deal going for it.This particular branch is really big too, and I've often seen a lot of grafitti around the area - some entrepreneurial kids have changed the 'B' to an 'F' in the streets. Charming.The staff are lovely too, but the grafitti in the area makes me a bit scared of this branch...but the shop itself is good.
1	Majestic Wine enforce a 6 Bottle purchase minimum.The prices are no less than bargains found elsewhere.Snobbery at it's worst from youngsters who should know better.I am not impressed in the slightest.
