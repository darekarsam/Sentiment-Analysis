1	They have never once gotten my order right at this KFC. There is always sauce when I ask for none on a sandwich, the wrong dipping sauce for my strips, etc. Okay, maybe they did get my order correct once... But it was awful! Check out the pictures to see what I'm referring to.
1	I love kfc's mashed potatoes... They are just downright glorious. However, the last two times I've gone to this location, there has been more breading than chicken, the chicken strips have been stale as all get out, and my mashed potatoes were far less than glorious; in fact, they've been down right mediocre at best. Last night, my roommate and I went to grab some dinner and I could barely eat my chicken strips they were so hard. My potatoes were cold and the service was just awful. The service was slow, they got our drinks wrong, and the employees were really rude. I'm not sure I'll be returning.
1	GROSS! I went through the drive thru but had to go in because after waiting 10 mins my food  was still not done. Don't go in. It's filthy! Grease everywhere. Thick old grease. They hadn't even started my order. ....glad I didn't keep waiting. ...and threw it all in a bucket. I ordered extra crispy and got extra greasy. I think I pissed then off because my food was all smashed when I got home. If you want fried chicken and you are on the area, go to fry's on Val Vista. Hot, crispy and fresh. What happened to kfc? Ugh not returning.
