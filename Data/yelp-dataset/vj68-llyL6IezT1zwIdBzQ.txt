1	Don't go here for your repair. They state that they warranty their products and services but if you are like me then they will fix your screen but screw up your graphics board and then leave you hanging to pay to fix it yourself. The problem wasn't their prior to the repair even with the cracked screen so I can only assume that they caused it when the screen was repaired. I feel bad leaving a bad review because Ryan the tech was great but the management team will not do what is right for the customer and fix the issue they caused. Avoid the hassle and go somewhere else for your repairs.
3	I am providing an update on the screen repair on behalf of the Tech Ryan.  In the end the company did replace the iPhone with a similar model in similar condition.  It was not something that was offered up front and Ryan was really good about doing everything in his power to make sure that the issue was resolved.  Would I use iCracked again?  I don't know, But I do honestly believe that Ryan, the Tech, is a good tech and will take care of you as a customer.  I can't honestly give more than 3 stars for the process but if I could give Ryan a rating on him and his service then it would be 5 stars.
4	Great Service. Fixed my iPhone 4s Cracked Screen and repaired the water damage from going swimming with the Phone!!! Highly Recommend iCracked Professional iPhone, iPod and iPad Repair  for iPhone repairers!!
