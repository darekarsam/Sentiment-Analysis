5	The Drs are awesome, the staff is professional and friendly and they have a good selection of frames.  This is about the best place to go for contacts and glasses in the east valley.
2	Dr. Miller was great!!! It was the front desk staff that was rude and unprofessional. When I arrived, the employee at the front desk told me she didn't have me down for an appointment. When I showed her my email confirmation, she literally said nothing. She just kept saying, "umm?" I wasn't sure if I was going to be seen because I had no communication from her. I decided to take a seat because nothing was being said to me. After a long wait, Dr. Miller took me back and conducted the appointment. That was fine. Afterwards, Dr. Miller walked me out to the front so an employee could go over my insurance information. The employee acted frazzled and said she was in the middle of something. I've worked in support staff at a medical office. It is the worst thing to do to ignore the patient. Dr. Miller then told me to take a seat and wait for someone else. The whole experience took an hour.
2	I have to agree with one of the other reviewers (Elizabeth). This place is 2 stars, "Meh. I've experienced better." Dr. Miller was great and I had an appointment that I found to be great. He was gentle, not too loud, reasonably paced when adjusting between lenses.However, the front staff, was so rude. First, the billing process, so many frowns and snappiness. Also when I came to pick up my frames, I had them adjusted, but after a day the slipping really came to bug me. I went back to get them adjusted again, the person refused to help me. I had to practically wave my receipt for him to adjust the thing. In the end, I just went to Costco. They adjusted it for me and I didn't even buy it form them.Summary, I will probably visit Dr. Miller again. Buy glasses here? No. I'd rather not deal with all that attitude.
