4	Love the outdoor patio!  The perfect venue for relaxing with music and a cold beer.
4	Love this place. Every time I come here its like a high school reunion. There's wonderful people and a perfect atmosphere for drinking.
1	This place is a joke with some of the worst service in town.. The locals call it a "club", its prefect for one drink because the likelihood of getting another before dawn is slim..
2	My mouth has a weird aftertaste. It could of been the cockroach that scurried across the floor and ended up in my burger. Free wings on Monday night football. That's cool. Cheap beer. They raised over$1,000 for a nonprofit one night for local teens in need of help. That's cool. We are in Wickenburg
