2	Machines are very old - many out-of-order. Premises not very clean.  A tacky place.  Will not go there again.
4	Came here to use commercial washers for my comforters. Place is kept very clean and their staff is very helpful and helped me choose the right machines that I needed. The machines seem a little old but didn't have any problems with them. A+ staff!
