2	It's not the end-all, be-all of awful...but it's sub-par.  Perhaps it's just the experiences I've had there (experiences unrelated to the bar itself) that make the bile rise in my throat when its name is mentioned.  In any case, it's a wood-paneled, dank bar with green and yellow Green Bay Packers curtains.  Do you really need to know any more about it?
2	Late night Madison is tough when you are hungry.  I saw that this dive bar was packed the night before so we stopped in on a Sunday evening.  The few patrons in the bar were playing metal at full volume.  We all had the Packer Burger which was a big MEH.  Not the worst place I have ever been but I have been to some dumps.  I would not seek the Packer Inn out in the future.
