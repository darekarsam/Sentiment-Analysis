1	Radio Shack does not honor the manufacture warranty unless you purchase the extended warranty from Radio Shack.  I will NEVER purchase anything from Radio Shack again and recommend that you don't either!
4	CHRISTMAS PRESENT #1 IS OUT OF THE WAY!Stopped by here this week cause I wanted to get my mom the Canon PowerShot Elph 100HS in Grey and Radioshack has it on sale for $109 this week. The salesguy was nice enough to let me know that the memory cards were on sale too. I also picked up a Sandisk 8gb SDHC for $12.99.
5	Stopped in here looking for two things, a specific adapter and a certain length of cable to wire up GPS on motorcycle, had the cable not the adapter.  But staff was super awesome friendly, didn't try to sell me most $$$ one but explained the differences and let me decide.  I will be back for assistance on those things I'm not sure of in the future.
