4	I was visiting Pittsburgh for my best friend's baby shower and she suggested I try Norma for reflexology. I have experience with all kinds of massage but not reflexology. The location is traditional office space that Norma has beautifully appointed to look like a spa oasis. She even took care to cover the drop ceiling over the massage table with billowy fabric. Since I have never had reflexology prior to this, I can't compare her technique to anyone else, but it was relaxing - I fell asleep during the session. Before I went in I was experiencing some back pain that was immediately alleviated following the session. Following the session I asked Norma if she felt anything "weird" in my feet - she said nothing was out of the ordinary - I did tell her where I had been feeling pain. She did mention that she felt some congestion in my vocal chord area - this was amazing b/c I conduct presentations for a living and this would be totally accurate - my vocal chords are indeed under a lot of stress! Norma offers a wide range of services--traditional Swedish massage, deep tissue, prenatal, hot stone and Thai. I would recommend her and I would also return for a visit the next time I'm in the area.
5	Norma is a wonderful masseuse and I wholeheartedly recommend her. I'd been having difficulty finding a good Thai massage which is my preferred treatment when my wife heard that it was offered at Massana. During my first treatment she noticed my neck was rather in need of some special work and we've switched methods. I like her knowledge of multiple methods, her ability to respond to my bodies needs and her flexibility in fitting me in.
5	Relaxing environment.  Gena was fabulous!  Very skilled. My trouble spots feel so much better. Will go back again.   Able to make appointments online. Easy to find.
