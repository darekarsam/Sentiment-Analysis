1	Horrible service. Lumpy, jagged shellac manicure.
5	This local nail salon has been around for about 10 years (maybe more) right next to my parents house. The owners are John and Tammy and they are super friendly. My whole family (even Dad!) goes there for mani/pedi/wax. If you are going to go try to request John / Tony / Tammy and Kandy because they absolutely do the best nails at this place. EM does awesome pedicures. Tammy has also been waxing my eye brows for as long as I can remember. I really like coming here because I feel like its clean and they are also VERY friendly. They talk to you and even wave if you are just walking by to go to the grocery store next door. Their prices are a a teensy bit higher than other non-spa like nail places but, I am fine with paying their prices because they know my name and I feel like I know what im getting when I go there. I love OH! Nails :)
5	I've been coming to this nail salon for almost two years now and I love it. They always do a good job on my manicure and pedicure. Everyone is so friendly and they remember your name. I usually come during my lunch and they always make sure I get my nails done in time to make it back to work :)
1	Terrible experience! Went in for a simple fill, and came out looking like I had press on nailsfrom the drug store; tech could not speak English and his overgrown nails were dirty.Not a sanitary place; will never go back.Don't waste your money!
5	Super nice people and John does a great job. My nails last a long time without lifting.
5	Love this place! Very friendly and they ways remember me. Tammy does THE best eyebrow waxing in the valley HANDS DOWN.  John is great for nails and Anh for pedis! Great family run place- friendly and never had a complaint about their work
