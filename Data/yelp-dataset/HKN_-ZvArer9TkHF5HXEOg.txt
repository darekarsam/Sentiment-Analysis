4	This is a very nice hotel, especially for the price.  Breakfast every morning is great (not healthy!).  The bartender Mark is a great guy.  He has a ton of stories, who knows if they are true.As of last spring, they had a parrot.  That was cool.
5	Wow!  This place is absolutely amazing for the price.  I paid $68 per night for a very spacious king studio w/ full kitchen and dinette.  They also have a hot breakfast buffet with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and pancakes included in the price.  Oh, and fresh pineapple too!Plus they have a large cage with a blue and gold macaw at the front entrance.  I'm always a sucker for pet parrots.
