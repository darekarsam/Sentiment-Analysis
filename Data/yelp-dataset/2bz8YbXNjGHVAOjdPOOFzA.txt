5	This Starbucks is right inside of Macy's. Yep, it is true and it is the same great tasting Starbucks we have grown to love.I have had the pleasure to drop by twice during my long holiday shopping hours. It was nice to see a Starbucks open late during the mad holiday rush hours. This location is staffed properly with four baristas working hard to meet the needs of each patron that needs to be served. It is located in the men's section near the main entrance. Has the same great drinks, treats and food options other Starbucks have. There is even a small dining sections with chairs and a few tables. Sit and shop. They have some unique coffee cups and other fun items to purchase. My service was quick and I was greeted with a smile. I even got a thank you when my service was done. Both times my drinks and food were properly made correctly. I can even use my Starbucks Gold Card.
1	The staff is friendly enough but obviously inexperienced and unprofessional. Slow, inaccurate and not worth the convenience. If you work at the mall, go across the street to the real Starbucks.As an update to this review I want to iterate that for whatever it's worth this will be my last cent spent here. Raymond is the baristas name that made this decision easy. His rude and unprofessional comment about my workplace and his general attitude towards customers is disgusting. How could an established company such as this door such a poor job hiring?
5	Rebecca is by far the sweetest barista ever!! From the first time I met her she remembered my name- so nice in a world of impersonal service.  This Starbucks has all the coffee drinks and teas of other locations but not as much food as other spots.  They still have the pastry case and several grab and go beverage options.After going to the same (different) Starbucks for years Rebecca is the first person to take the time to remember me!  What a gem!  Also one of the blonde girls was sweet to me saying I look just like Drew Barrymore... I'll take it!
