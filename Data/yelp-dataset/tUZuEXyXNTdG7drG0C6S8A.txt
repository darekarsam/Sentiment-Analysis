1	The buffet was smaller than most but that wasn't a big deal. The problem was the dry and hard food. Then our bill had a  mandatory18% tip and a $13 service charge???? There are better places to eat close by at a better price.

3	While visiting for a conference we stopped by for breakfast. It's always nice having a buffet option when you're in a hurry. There is cereal (go lucky charms!), fruit, pastries and hot food like bacon, hashbrown and eggs. Do yourself a favor, skip the order and go for the buffet. It's worth the money, although I hope your company is paying the bill based on the automatic charges based on other reviewers.
