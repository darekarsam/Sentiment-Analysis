4	Hardee's now has a new concept, on top of offering burgers, fries, hot dogs and chicken sandwiches, they now offer Mexican fare.  Yes ladies and gentlemen the Southern staple of Hardee's now sells taco, burritos and nachos.  Being from Rocky Mount; I've always been pro Hardee's since that's where they were founded and I used to enjoy eating at their original first location.  I'm a little bummed that they no longer serve the Big Deluxe, but I'm still a fan of their cooked to order burgers.If you're new to Hardee's, I suggest trying the breakfast food first.  It's extremely greasy and fattening and will probably make your chest hurt for a few hours, but man is it good.  The burritos and tacos are better than taco bell, however a little more expensive.  You also can't beat their thick burgers with all the fresh toppings.Nearly everything is cooked to order with the exception of breakfast, so anticipate at least a 5 minute wait at the drive thru.  The inside is fairly clean and spacious, so eating inside is a good option also.  I also recommend the sweet tea.
3	They are slowwwwwww! Haven't eaten here in yrs. Don't plan on going any time soon. Want a good burger, go to Jack in the Box! Curly fries? Go to Jack in the Box! Don't waste your time. Hardeez used to be hot! Times sure have changed.

2	Oh my god SOO slow!!!! I've been in line at the drive thru for 10 minutes for a Frisco Burger and there are still two cars in front of me!!
