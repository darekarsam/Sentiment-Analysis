3	Sorry Too premature evaluationWill update based on response to the problem
4	The issue was resolved in a timely fashion , I will give Brian a compliment for taking it with the insurance company .
5	We moved into New home and issues with our upstairs unit. Brian came over the following day and determined that our compressor was out. Airtime is definitely one of the better companies I've worked with using my Home warranty service, after a terrible experience I had with Just Plumbing I thought all vendors were going to treat Home warranty customers the same, but Brian was a real pro and went above and beyond to help save money.   Airtime ordered the part and had it available for install in a timely manner. Thanks Brian for the great customer service, and we will absolutely continue to work with Airtime for our preventative maintenance!
