2	First time at Frankie & Bennys, but disappointed with the food. Typical American fare, with lots of fried food and meat. But neither were tasty. Our sharing platter had a range of nibbles, but all were a bit lacklustre, tasting like the frozen stuff you get from Iceland.I had the F&B special of ribs and chicken, but the ribs lacked flavour, and the chicken was extremely tough. Fries were ok though.Service was also a bit slow, which was surprising considering it was a Wednesday evening, it was pouring outside, and the place was less than half full.The London Insiderhttp://www.london-insider.co.uk/
