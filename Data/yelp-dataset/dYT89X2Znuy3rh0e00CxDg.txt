4	Very tasty thin crust.
2	Tried the order on line thing at this Domino's near my NLV pad...Web site was so-so...I am a very computer literate person but it took me several clicks to figure out how to move on in this site...Could be even easier for the layman...Anyway, now have a complete full profile with Domino' s and next order should be a tad easier...I got to the location within ten minutes and at the counter had a bit of a run around by the young lady...She said there was NO order in my name...I was getting steamed as I looked into her "deer in the headlights" look...Why, oh why must these fast food places stock the place with near idiots...Pay a bit more for a little less staff and get some folks with smarts and watch the efficiency skyrocket...Three minutes in my frustration mode the manager came forward and said the lady had mislabeled the boxes ready to hold MY order...I WAS in the computer and I had my grub in two more minutes...Pan pizza, Italian sandwich and lava cake set me back about twenty-two bucks...Food quality?  Was just "C-" level...Blood pressure?  On the rise thanks to less than capable staff...Hopefully next time I grace Domino's porch for some quick grub it goes a bit better...
5	Been using their computer ordering system with tremendous success...Today I screwed up the order and a real live person from the store called to confirm what I really wanted...Kudos Domino's for getting it really right!
1	2 weeks ago they forgot part of delivery order.Last night a 25-35 min delivery time, ended up being 65 min. No more.You've lost this customer.
1	Ok...DO NOT order from these guys on Friday or Saturday night...I have voiced my opinion to the managers...I told him that everytime that I order on the weekends my pizza arrives under cooked...this happen over 5 times....I will not order from here again!!..
5	pizza always hot and fresh, made to my preference. great service every time i order
