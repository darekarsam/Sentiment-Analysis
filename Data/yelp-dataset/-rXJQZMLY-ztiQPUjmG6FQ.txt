4	Viva la France!How can you not like Louis Vuitton?  If only they would go on half price sale (then they would still be expensive).
4	Bought my first LV bag here a few years back, when I was visiting a friend.  Service was impeccable then, and it didn't change today.  My friend even pointed out that the girl helping us was the same girl the last time I was at the store.  This time, I didn't buy anything, just browsing, but that didn't affect the service at all.
5	Love this store!! got my christmas present from here last year ( i love you mum and dad!!). I love their service, alway soo nice even though sometime I'm just browsing. and their alot better then their other location which is in Hawaii (the staff over there was soo rude, just because I'm from the mainland doesn't mean I don't have freaking money..) well back to NC, I love them!
5	Louis Vuitton makes stylish, well made, long lasting, leather products.  {LV products currently owned: Briefcase. Wallet(s). Checkbook cover. Business organizer. Shoes.} PS: Louis Vuitton will gladly custom make an item in France, if it is not currently listed in their catalog, i.e., the LV business organizer listed above. For a fee, they will also refurbish used items in France, and return the product to one by post, in AS NEW condition. Excellent products. Wonderful company. For the expensive price, one gets superb quality leather goods and fantastic customer support. The only negative aspect to the LV experience, is the somewhat snooty attitude that permeates the store, as if the sales staff are sizing up whether a customer deserves to shop there. Whipping out a Platinum card usually puts an end to this. LOL. Also, the armed guard can be a little intimidating. ;o)
