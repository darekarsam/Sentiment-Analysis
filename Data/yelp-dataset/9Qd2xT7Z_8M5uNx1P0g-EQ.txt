5	My front left window was smashed out and I called these guys on a Saturday morning. They quoted me over the phone, which was $150 cheaper than Safelite and comparable to Glass Masters, but they were only ones that could fix it same day. Plus they offered to do it at my house for nothing extra. Safelite charges on-site fee and Glass Masters sounds sketchy over the phone. Fixed it in under 60 minutes. Definitely recommend.
5	OMG I broke my hatchback's rear window when I was trying to replace the struts that hold it open. Really, really dumb! So I called around. Ouch $420 was the lowest I could find. Then I called QC Windshield Repair... $270 and they would come to me. OK! They were out with a truck the next day and installed a new window in less than 1 hour. Cleaned everything up (including the broken glass all over my back seat) and were done in less than an hour. Really great work and a very reasonable price. Thanks guys.
1	Do NOT use this company! They may be cheaper than most competitors but you get what you pay for. They installed a new windshield in my vehicle. I followed all instructions given by the installer (leave the tape on for 48 hrs and do not wash the vehicle for a week and a half) however the very next day after the install - and every day since - the glass rattles every time I hit a bump. I called them to repair and he came out and only attempted to tightened the trim around the glass which did not fix the issue - in fact, it made it worse. Now he refuses to fix or replace the glass. I always try to use local mom and pop shops when I can but next time I'll pay the extra $50 to have Safelite do it...correctly. Learn from my mistake and choose a different installer for your auto glass!
