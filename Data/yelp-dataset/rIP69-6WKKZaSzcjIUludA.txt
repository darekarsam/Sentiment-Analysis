1	I would give 0 stars if I could. I scheduled a massage with the owner for my birthday and she never showed up. Didn't answer a phone call or a text. Didn't even respond to the building manager calling her.  Still haven't gotten any explanation or a call back to reschedule.  I made the mistake of buying a groupon. Wasted $29.  Rude!
1	Like the previous reviewer, I waited and waited and she never showed up.  It took a week for her to respond for my request for a massage in the first place.  Definitely go somewhere else.
1	I had an appt set and then I was called and the appt was cancelled due the owner having the flu. She was going to call to reschedule - that was a month ago and I called 3x's and left messages as well as emailed the business. No response to any on my efforts. I bough t two appts but can't get anything scheduled. I'm very disappointed and will be notifying Groupon for a refund for both. This is not a business I care to work with since there is no regard to the customer.
