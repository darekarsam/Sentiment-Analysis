2	We ended up eating here, only because Old Pueblo was closed for remodeling. The food was OK, along with the service. I had the carnitas chimichanga, meat was bland, no seasoning or spice. Girlfriend had the chile relleno, same bland taste. The total ended up being about $35 for the 3 of us, which IMHO was way over priced for the quality and taste and they charge you 50 cents to run any type of credit/debit card too, and that's always annoying.
4	Not spectacular, but not bad. Quick easy and the salsa is great! The food is nothing to write home about, but if you are a chips and salsa fan this place will keep you coming back.
4	Of the three Mexican food places in Florence, Jalapenos is the best! Their burrito selection is plentiful and the burritos are huge...try the Chilli Relleno Burrito.
4	Good stuff!  I grew up in Tx and live in NM so I have a clue about good Mexican food and this is some good stuff.
