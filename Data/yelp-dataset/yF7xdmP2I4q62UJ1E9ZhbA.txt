2	Overcooked dry filet mignon, very cold ambiance. Waiters seemed very confused and messed up on many orders in a reservation for 40 people.. The oysters were way to salty.. I won't be in a rush to return any time soon!
4	L'academie is a beautiful restaurant that serves simple French/Italian food at affordable prices.Noticeably, if you come on Sunday to Thursday, they have a 12$ pasta or mussel special which comes with salad or soup of the day. You get a basket of bread with every meal.I wouldn't recommend paying full price otherwise because their pasta dishes can be upwards of 18$ which isn't that worth it.I've tried their spaghetti bolognaise sauce, alfredo and smoked saumon alfredo pastas which were all delicious.Their alfredo sauce is extremely creamy but it doesn't have that hint of garlic or enough buttery taste to really satisfy me.I've never had an issue with service, fast, prompt, efficient.Washroom perks: free dental floss dispenser!
