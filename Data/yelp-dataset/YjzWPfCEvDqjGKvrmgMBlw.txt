4	This place is great for finding a bargain and I have to admit, with the City full of charity shops, this little gem is sure competition. Located in the pretty area of Bruntsfield this place seems to gather some very decent stock (with regards to ladies clothing) and occasionally some big designers make a short appearance on the racks, before being whipped up by my more experienced charity shopper friend. Because of its small size and location it seems to be quite a quiet place- at least the couple of times I have been in. Worth a visit even if it is just to browse.
