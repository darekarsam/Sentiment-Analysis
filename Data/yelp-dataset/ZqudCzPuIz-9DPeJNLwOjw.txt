5	Elaine is amazing at lashes! She also teaches great classes and her product is top of the line!! Very happy
5	I got my eyelash extensions at ilashcandy and they are great. I recommend them to everyone. They also do hair extensions and I will be checking that out soon.
2	Did a so so job. Expensive for the clumpy lashes I got. I've had far better lashes since.
1	By far was the worst experience, my individual lashes were put on completely crooked and some up side down, I had to try a new salon for a fill because my usual technician was out of town. I had to have them completely removed as soon as I looked in the mirror because my lashes looked like I've slept on my face all night. Wasted 2 hours of my time and completely messed up my eyes.
