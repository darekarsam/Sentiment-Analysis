1	Terrible service! Terrible!!! As for the rest... Well it's hot dogs.
3	Classic Quebec diner in the middle of the plateau. Very friendly service at 2PM on a random Tuesday, I suspect it may be different when very busy (i.e. over brunch, late night, etc.). Their hotdogs are pretty much just regular diner quality. Supermarket buns and hotdogs, and the steamies "all dressed' were just what you'd expect. As far as the poutine goes, the gravy was a standard pre-made mix but acceptable (not too salty, not too sweet), and the cheese was of the right kind (salty cheddar cheese curds) but certainly not fresh. Not only did they not squeak, but they also were a little hard with crisp outside - suggesting they were at least from a day ago or had been hastily thawed. The fries were excellent - fried twice, and crispy.All in all, it did the job. But I would never seek this place out.
4	This place has probably the best poutine in all of Montreal!!! Every time i'm back in Montreal, I have to come here for their famous poutine :D I tried their hot-dogs this time, it's just so so, if you are looking for good hot-dogs in Montreal, go to Decarie Hot-Dog.
1	I went to pay the cashier and coulnd't understand French. So my friend who is fluent translated for me. The cashier then said, "Oh should I speak in Chinese? Ching chong ching chong ching chong." Do not patronize this racist establishment.
3	A hot dog is a hot dog. I never walked in to order the food to be honest with you, but the hot dogs were good...
3	Good hotdogs and nothing much to say about this. If you are looking for a quick fix for hotdogs, then this one is just for that.
