1	This is another store from which we have to move our dollars away from.      We often use them for clothing and some housewares.   They are also conveniently located by other businesses that we frequently shop at.  Sadly, they have chosen to open their stores early this Thanksgiving destroying any chance for their employees to enjoy the holiday.  As a result we will be taking our dollars elsewhere.    Any store that opens prior to 5am on friday morning after Thanksgiving will lose our business.
3	While ShopKo is still needing to up its game in general, I stopped in for the Payless. I had a coupon and wasn't sure how it would work with the store-in-a-store situation. The clerk at the checkout was very happy to take it and even double-checked that it had gone through the system properly. 2 people greeted me when I entered and 3 thanked me as I left. While the offerings of the store are needing a bit of improving, they've got their customer service down pat.
1	I got lied to by a GPS purchase, I was promised it had free lifetime map updates but it turns out, it does not.  The customer service desk people were nice and understanding but the manager that was brought over was extremely rude and dismissive.  I could not return the gps or was offered anything to rectify me spending too much money on the gps.  I will never come back here and everytime Shopko is brought up I will share this story.
