5	I love Sally's! I'm the type of gal that likes to save money on beauty. Many times I find myself pampering myself to save on cash. Sally's is the best place to shop for professional beauty products for women like me that can do it ourselves. Maybe a manicure, facial, makeup, waxing or a new hairdo the licensed sales associates are an added resources if you need suggestions on how or what to do. They even offer loyalty programs, such as the Beauty Club Card for our non-professional customers and the Sally ProCard for our professional customers. These cards offer discounts on every item in the store. Great way to save!This is my first time at this location. The staff said "hello' the moment I walked through the door. They even asked me if I needed help. The great thing about Sally's no matter which location you shop at they are all organized and have the pretty much the same layouts so it is easy to locate the items you shop for the most. Men, Sally's is here for you too. You will find items that you use including clippers. Next time you drop in be sure to grab a store flyer. The color printer flyer shows all the items that are on sale.
