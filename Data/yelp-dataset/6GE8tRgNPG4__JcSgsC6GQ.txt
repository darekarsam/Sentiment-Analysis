3	Great pizza. I've had it 3 times. Would go again. But the place is a little dingy. But most good pizza places are;)
5	Did 'pizza night' with our friends and tried Martini Pizza.  Not greasy, great dough, not soggy at all!  Great pizza  wiht loads of cheese.  We'll definitely give them a call again!!!
