5	Who doesn't love pizza!
4	I like pizza hut from time to time this one is only a couple miles from my house and a quit late night stop. I really like this store the ppl that work here are great. The drivers are really friendly I've spoke to them a couple times as well. Managers are always friendly as well.
2	Saw the baxcon and cheese commercial and thought I better get one of those. Big mistake. Where's the bacon and cheese that's supposed to be in the crust? Mine just had air in it, what a letdown. I'll call someone else next time
