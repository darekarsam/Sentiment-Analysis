5	These East-coast bagel gurus give good bread!  Grab a box of a dozen, don't even think too hard about the flavors because they're all great, and any cream cheese will be perfect.
4	Love Bagleman's!! I always used to come here to get the Sesame bagel with Veggie Light cream cheese. They have a very large menu with everything from bagels, to soup, to sandwiches. They also have a drive up windown which is nice if your in a hurry!
2	Bagelman's is closed.Regardless, I'll give them a posthumous review:  WHY OH WHY did you have to change?  You had wonderful NY-style water bagels.  Crusty on the outside, yet dense and soft on the inside.  I would have happily given you five stars just for your plain bagel.But then you changed.You closed your bagel factory and started shipping them in from some crap food distributor.  They had the consistency of cardboard and no flavor.  None.  Even the blueberry bagels:  they were purple, like there might be a hint of berry flavor, but no.You might as well have bought square ones.  At least you could market that.  (Squagles!)But I'm proud of you for closing up shop right after you started sucking.  It was the honorable thing to do, so you get two stars.
4	Yes, these used to be my favorite bagels-but as the previous reviewer pointed out-they changed, and then closed-which was probably the best thing they could have done. I will miss your formerly delicious bagels. RIP.
