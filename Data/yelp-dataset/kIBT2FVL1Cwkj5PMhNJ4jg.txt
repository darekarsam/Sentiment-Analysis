5	Called to make a new patient appointment for an eye exam and contacts. And I was offered same day right away service. And the office front staff was wonderful - answering all my questions and making me feel at home ( which is good since I'm new to the area) Dr. Hai Tran was awesome and made me feel at ease and was thorough with the exam. It was a great experience all around.  I definitely recommend them to anyone new to the area or even those just looking to switch eye doctors. If you need an exam - call them ASAP- they are well worth this review!!!! Oh and they do take walk in emergency appointments!! Thanks Golden Vision!!!!
5	Golden Vision is just one of many eye care offices in the 89148 area. I've been to several over the years looking for just the right doctor to help me achieve the best vision possible for my challenging prescription. Dr. Tran is the first eye doctor I felt genuinely cared about helping me see better. He listened, took note, and over several appointments measured and remeasured until we got it just right. And at no added expense.His office personnel are super friendly and thorough as well. I highly recommend Golden Vision to anyone seeking a well qualified, personable doctor practicing out of a nice, newer office.
5	I went to Golden Vision for an eye exam and had a great experience. Since it was my very first eye exam I didn't know what to expect. However, the front staff (Tina) was extremely helpful and friendly. Dr. Tran was also very friendly and knowledgeable. They both made me feel comfortable during the whole process. After my exam, Tina was also able to show me the different sunglasses that were available. Overall experience was great and would definitely recommend Golden Vision!
