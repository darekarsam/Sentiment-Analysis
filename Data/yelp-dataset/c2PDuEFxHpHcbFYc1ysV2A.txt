5	These guys were fantastic in restoring some major damage on my recently acquired Infinite . The body work and paint was perfect, shined like polished glass. Both my wife and I am completely satisfied  and happy with our 'new' 2008  Infinite G36xWe would definitely recommend them  to anyone who wants courteous, professional and detailed work. We will definitely use them again . Thanks again for the great work!
5	Had my rear bumper caved in on my 2012 Ford Fusion. Used Tom Mortensen and his brother of "Colors On The Run" to repair it.They came right to my garage and did an unbelievably FANTASTIC job!!They repaired the caved in bumper and painted it and it looks as though they put a brand new bumper on it!Can`t rave about these guys and the job they did enough!
5	I could have spent $750 more and left my car 2 days to have the dealer put a new bumper cover on, but I went with these guys to repair the punctured bumper on my 2004 Toyota Avalon, and I'm glad I did! My bumper looks new, and the best thing is, they did the work at my home and I didn't need to drop my car off at the dealer and get a rental car. I also had a custom paint color!
1	I'm really not sure if I got the run around or not, but I called this company today about some door dings I wanted to get fixed and painted.  I guess they don't fix dings even though on their site it says, "Paintless dent repair (PDR) includes removing hail damage, fixing dents, dings, and buckles." I guess lesson learned is don't call these guys if you have door dings even though they advertise it on their site.
