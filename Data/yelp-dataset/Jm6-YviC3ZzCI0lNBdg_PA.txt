5	I've worked with Neal Law on several projects. Abby has been a big help with putting together tight, professional business contracts. She's made sure that my contracts are logical and cover all the possible bases.I highly recommend Neal Law to anyone looking for an extra set of eyes on their legal documents (and rock solid contracts).
5	My wife and I were thinking about our family and how we could help our two boys if anything were to happen to us. We found Ms. Neal through a friend of ours and she was kind enough to walk us through the estate planning process and answered our questions with ease. She respected our wishes and valued our input. She made the process a lot easier than we thought. I definitely would recommend her if you are looking for someone to help with your estate planning needs.
5	Abby is incredibly professional and knowledgable.  My experience working with her was by far the best experience I've had in working with any attorney.  She was patient, articulate, responsive, and was extremely fair and practical with billing.  I had an excellent experience working with her, and would recommend her enthusiastically to anyone I know.
