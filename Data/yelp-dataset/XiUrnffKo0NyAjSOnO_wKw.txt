3	CO's is slightly classier than Kam's and has a slightly older crowd. Good specials, Mondays are $1 you call it's and Wednesdays are $5 ice bombs, which I believe are a CO's invention, because I've never heard of them anywhere else. They definitely get the job done. There are old school video games in the back, the bathrooms sometimes over flow all the way into the bar area, and it can be crowded. There's usually cover on weekend nights after 10 and a line, I think about $5. Honestly, it's a typical college bar.
1	When I was 18, I thought this place was the greatest thing ever.I was pretty stupid when I was 18.
4	This is where I had my first "party night" out back in 1989 (I was 18... not quite drinking age but I had a fake ID). I was pledging a local fraternity and they brought me here and got me wasted on Blue Hawaiians. Later in the evening, a Senior came in and pretended to bust me for underage drinking. This was where I met countless (and I really mean countless) women prior to questionable late night hookups. I still remember many faces but sadly, very few names. Such was the magic of COs.COs is where on not one, but two, occasions my friends who later respectively became a successful doctor and a well-known physicist kicked off their 21st birthdays off (both of them ended the evening in the local ER to get treated for alcohol poisoning).I haven't been there since maybe 1999 but I can still recall the sickly sweet smell of puke and stale beer that wafted past the place as I walked past to my morning classes.Yes, so questionable, but the people you'll meet there eventually go on to do some remarkable things! Enjoy your time there... I'd give anything to have it back!
