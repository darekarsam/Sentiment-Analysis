4	Noisy, crowded, and with far too few waitstaff -- yet mostly good experiences here. Their hot chocolates, in particular, are to die for (try the white chocolate or the chili one!), as they're proper thick chocolate. Being right next to the tram tracks and on the main drag AND next to a central area, it's noisy, as I said, but the people-watching is excellent and the noms are good.
