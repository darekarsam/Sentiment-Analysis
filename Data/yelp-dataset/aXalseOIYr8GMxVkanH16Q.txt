4	Nothing like a nice bar that's SUPER close to the metro on a crazy cold night. Boul Noir is pretty hidden though, don't be surprised if you walk past it. Just look for Jean Coutu, and it's right beside it, on top! I came here for the first time with my 2 cousins and man it's got a great ambiance. There's pool tables and plenty of space. Crowd is bit older, you won't see 18 year olds here, at least not many of them.It's a bit more on the expensive side because a pitcher was about 15 bucks. But I guess you pay for atmosphere as well. Would definitely visit again, and if you're looking for a nice lounge/bar with pool in the plateau area, come by Boul Noir. You'll like what you see.

Place is fine, not too crowded and not too noisy (when the game starts, it's something else, but you get used to that in Montreal).On Thursday, you can get a pitcher of beer for $10.75. A pint of keith is $5.75. Regarding the food, there are not a lot of choices, but it's also pretty cheap ($1.75 for a hot dog).Only cons are that service was omni-present (we had to move to the bar to order and to have the bills) and that I didn't appreciate our waitress said that you "have" to leave tips, that are normaly 15% of the overall bill (that's something you also get used to when you are French in Montreal)
