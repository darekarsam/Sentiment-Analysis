5	I had a great experience at this salon. Tami gave me a perfect blend of low and hi lights. My hair is very thin so she showed me some tips on how to make my hair look fuller. I usually don't write reviews but I had to get on here and give them a shout out.
5	Wonderful experience. I avoid getting my haircut because it causes me a lot of stress. This visit was stress free. Tami listened to my concerns and gave me an excellent haircut. I will be back!
