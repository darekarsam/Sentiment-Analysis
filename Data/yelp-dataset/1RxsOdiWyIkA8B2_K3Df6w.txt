5	I loved this shop so much when I was studying abroad in Edinburgh that when I saw that Yelp was in the UK, I immediately looked up this place to review it.  A million wonderful things to say:- Just about the only place to get American-style (not Canadian-style) bacon in Edinburgh- My introduction to fresh mozz cheese--OMG so good when paninied!- Friendly staff--a must when you're studying abroad so far from home!Drool--just thinking about a chicken-bacon-mozzarella panini with tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers and pepper from this place is making me miss Edinburgh. A lot.
4	Small friendly sandwich shop with a Dutch influence.  The owner is always friendly and great care and attention goes on making every sandwich.There are a few seats inside if you want to sit in but it's just a few paces from the Meadows where you can enjoy the outdoors and have your sandwich on a park bench.
