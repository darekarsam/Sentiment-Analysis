5	Groomingdales is a wonderful local grooming store for your pet. Robin and Sean the owners are genuine people who care about animals and will treat your pet as if it is their own. I love the environment that the animal is not kept in a cage and can have free reign of the shop while they are waiting for their turn at grooming. I also took my Chloe (yorkie) in for daycare yesterday and when I picked her up at the end of the day, she was good and tired from having a fun filled day. Stop in and chat with Robin or Sean and get to know them, you won't regret it. Lastly - their address for their shop has moved, the Yelp administrator hasn't approved the address change - they are now located on 17224 N. 43rd avenue. Less than a mile from their previous location, just right over on 43rd, just North of Bell on the west side.
4	They have been grooming my dog for years and have a wonderful personality for this type of business. My dog never fights me to go and is not kept in the cage.Thanks for all you do!
5	These guys are great! I've got an older golden retriever who is an absolute sweetheart and both Sean and Robin absolutely love her. My dog loves going there as well. I think she might like them more than she likes me! . I highly recommend Groomingdales. My dog always comes back looking and smelling great!
