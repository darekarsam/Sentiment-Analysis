1	If I could give this place negative stars, I would. The service was incredibly slow. I waited over 40 minutes for a glass of water. My waitress consistently disappeared. I felt like I was being held hostage when it was time for me to leave because of my disappearing waitress, who didn't bring me my check until 25 minutes AFTER I asked for it.

The service has been slow at times but it varies and seems to have improved lately. Prices are just a little high, they could probably drop them by two dollars or so across the menu. But at least the non-dessert crepes are well filled. If you want something a little different, give this place a try.
