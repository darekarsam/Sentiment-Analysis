5	This company is AWESOME! I had an old couch and love seat I couldn't even GIVE away to three different charities. I was so frustrated that I finally called 1-800 GOT JUNK. I'd heard the company's commercials on 96.9FM, and thought the "Magic Finger" was a bit odd, but nevertheless...I went online and saw the pricing. I called the company and was told I could also receive a $10 discount for going online. I amNOT kidding...within ONE HOUR, the GOT JUNK crew came to my house and took away the old furniture within minutes. They were fast, friendly AND I was actually charged much less than what I was quoted over the phone. I ended up paying less than $80 and got rid of the junk. It was well worth the price. This company is the "real deal." Too bad they can't haul away ex-husbands or boyfriends....
5	We have used Got Junk on many occasions. They always do a great job at a reasonable price. The workers are always very courteous and efficient.
5	They were professional, rates fair, and I can get a vehicle back in my garage. I like that they handle a variety of trash.
5	We have used 1-800-GOT-JUNK? twice within the last few months.  We were moving so we had quite a bit of junk for them to haul away.  They always called when they were on the way and arrived promptly within the scheduled time frame.  The employees were nice, helpful and professional.
