1	Since this location has diesel fuel, we have come to it frequently.  The snack selection at the market is very limited.We have had a terrible time with the car wash at this location. It does not work properly and has damaged the front of my car. We were told to call corporate to rectify the situation and have had no follow up or help on either end.
