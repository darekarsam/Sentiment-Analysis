5	Friendly staff, can't beat half priced drinks from 2-4 & half priced shakes after 8pm. It is always a treat when visit my mum in AZ. Nice cheap way to quench ones thirst. In Washington we have to drive 3+ hours to find a Sonic. Can never go wrong with Cherry Lime-aid or an Ocean Water in this triple digit weather.
1	Rude. Rude. Rude. To the employees: if you hate your job so much then quit or get a college degree, don't hate on your customers because you choose to work here. But anyway, this place sucks so bad with customer service & food sucks half the time too. Came here at 10:50 (they close at 11), employees are probably ticked because we came right before close, an employee left right around that time & shot us a dirty look while leaving. When we ordered there were 2 separate orders. Myself & my boyfriends friend ordered 2 separate orders & when the girl showed up at the table didn't greet us or anything. Literally said nothing. Didn't announce who's orders were who's, just set our bags down & walked off. The most awkward & uncomfortable situation ever. No one here was nice, I smiled at the girl when we showed up (she was outside spraying off the concrete)... Totally gave me a dirty look & turned away. This place needs new employees because this isn't the first time my food has been cold or drinks watered down. Not coming here again that's for sure. Just go to Cane's that's just down the street, better food & customer service. :)
1	Last time I ordered food at this location I got a really nasty burger that was fried/burnt on the edges. It was rock hard and disgusting!! I had to peel it off and then by the time all of it was peeled there was barely any of the burger to eat left.. I was still hungry which was super annoying.
