3	I have been coming here for YEARS and mainly for one reason. Her name is Heather and she paints my hair. I've gotten my share of other things done as well, waxing, nails, etc. Personally for the east side, their other services are way over priced. Now don't get me wrong you DO get what you pay for.  This is the only place I have had put hot stones between my toes, or give me a paraffin hand wax for free since I am always there. Over the years I've seen many come and go which is normal in salons. But there's a few solid people that know what they're doing and are great at it. I know I said the prices are steep, but as for Heather, she blows the competition out of the water on prices and service. Not sure if they still offer massage but they did at one point. Facials are also an option. Worth the stop if you're in the area.
5	Allie does the best pedicure on the East Side!  Well worth it and the price is right! She's moved salons make sure you call her direct!  702-279-8450
5	Allie was great! She was quick, organized and was a "chatty Cathy", but in a good way. She has the best colors and gives the best color advice for your nails. Looking forward to going back just to visit her!
5	Had a great first time experience today with Sandy! Made an appointment to get my hair dreams extensions removed and it was the best decision ever! After calling two other salons in town, I chose to drive across town to Sandy's oasis just because she has the most REASONABLE price for the service and I got more than what I bargained for. She was so friendly, kind, and efficient. I was late to my appointment also and she was very flexible and understanding. It didn't take more than an hour to remove my extensions and she was very attentive. If you have hairdreams or are interested in hairdreams and want the best, Sandy is well worth the drive, time, and money!!! She stands by her work and so do I! 5 stars for service, environment, staff, everything!
