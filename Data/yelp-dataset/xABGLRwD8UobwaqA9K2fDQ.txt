5	LOVE LOVE LOVE this store. They have great quality boutique style clothing and jewelry for women of all ages.  The store is always clean and the staff and owner are friendly. They know almost all of their customers by name and make you feel welcome all the time. They regularly have great and unique sales with good deals to be had for sure.
5	Desertique is a wonderful ladies boutique in North Scottsdale owned by Linda Hanna.  I've known her for years and find that she is not only a great merchandiser but can help clients determine what's really right for them.  She has terrific taste and it shows in the store!  It's a shop filled with something for everyone.  She makes everyone feel welcome without being overbearing--and knows everyone's name!  It's the best.
5	Cute things at reasonable prices.   I always find something slightly unusual here.
