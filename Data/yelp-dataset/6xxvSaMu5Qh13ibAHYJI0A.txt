5	I just started coming to Puzzles after following my colorist Jenna from another salon. I love it! The studio is set inside Hair Personality and it has a wonderful cozy vibe decorated with art from local artists. Each time I've been offered a glass of wine or other refreshment. Jenna and Samuel are wonderful and I would definitely recommend this place. The color and cuts have been fabulous thus far!
5	If you are in the Phoenix/Scottsdale/Tempe area you should come by Puzzles Studio and check out all they have to offer.  I've had Samuel as my stylist for over 15 years and cannot say enough about his amazing hair styling skills!  He talked me into trying Kera Straight about two years ago and it turned out to be one of the best investments I've ever made.  My hair is stronger, healthier and the longest it's ever been - Thank you Samuel!
5	Just had went to this new salon and absolutely love it!  The facility is warm, friendly and inviting...and beautiful decorated!  Jenna is a colorist and did a wonderful job with my hair.  I'll be back soon to try out their upcoming Blow Dry service.
