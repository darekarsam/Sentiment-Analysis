3	I had skipped breakfast and this was the first place I saw on a route that had been changed this morning.  So with my morning coffee I also got a breakfast sandwich.  At 500 calories it did the job but I am not sure I would pick QT again by choice for breakfast.  This particular location had a higher mix of business folks to gardeners than most I have been in.
5	Air for your tires is free, awesome. QT does things right.
5	Favorite QT! Employees always greet you right as you walk in the door and they are super fast at checkout.
4	Get gas, coffee snack just about everything you could ask for. I'm surprised they are not selling clothing yet. That will probably be next year. It is what it is.  There's only so much you can  write in a review.
5	Another perfect Quick Trip!!!! Some times I just don't have time to stop and eat lunch while at work so I will grab some of their pizza or a couple of hotdogs real quick, just so I can eat. Thank you QT for never failing me!
5	I've been a fan of QT since living in Oklahoma many years ago. They have only gotten better over the years. They always greet you. They have a good selection of grab n' go hot and cold food. A large selection of fountain drinks and coffees. The bathrooms are clean. Prices are reasonable. They are usually busy, but still keep the line moving when you pay.Definitely one of the better convenience stores!
