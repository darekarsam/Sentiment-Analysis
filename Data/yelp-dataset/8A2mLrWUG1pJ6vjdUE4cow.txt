4	Solid Van Houtte!! Good places to sit, very empty not busy on the Sunday I came in. Some the spots were a bit dirty with drinks on them not cleaned up but then someone came by and cleaned them as we were sitting there, not very well but decently haha. Coffee was solid, like any Van Houtte. Expensive coffees. $4 each. I had a Moka Frappe and it was tasty but so small for the price. If your getting coffee to go while shopping or whatever, this is a fine place to grab it. Service was friendly enough and I have no complaints, but again nothing amazing.All in all, it's just another Van Houtte.
