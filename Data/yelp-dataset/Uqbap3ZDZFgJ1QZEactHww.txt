5	Love this place!  Right up the street, good prices and VERY cute things inside.  From jewelry to knick-knacks you didn't know you need but suddenly have to have.  Service is friendly and my wife loves everything inside so, makes Bdays and such a snap!  Come visit!!
4	This is a nice boutique where I like to stop in from time to time.  I am able to pick up litte gift items for teachers and mysef, of course.  I purchased a purse hanger.  I have seen these litte gems at many other shops but no one bothered to explain how they worked.  Since I received an explanation with demonstration, I gladly purchased one and have been using it regularly.  Ladies, go in for a demo and you will know why this is quite a find!  They have knick-knacks, jewelry, and fashionably re-crafted clothing by Designs By Devon.  The boutique is located in a nice shopping center off of Highway 73, down the street from Harris Teeter and Birkdale Village.
