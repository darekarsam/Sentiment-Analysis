5	We wandered into All About Auto one day when our 2003 Dodge Ram was acting up. We had already had the engine rebuilt at another place and we were terrified that it was done poorly and the warranty had run out. The previous mechanic couldn't figure out the issue and blamed the transmission, another huge expense. We were prepared for the worst. John knew this truck inside and out and he shortly learned that there was a problem with the exhaust. It was fixed in minutes. We now recommend this place to everyone we know.
5	I had a really bad experience with a previous mechanic and John had to give me the bad news that the new engine I put in had blown. He had all the prices ready and gave me a great deal on a new motor with a warranty. John and his staff where great and it feels good to know I have a great mechanic again. The car is running better than it had in years...Thanks John  You have a customer for life.Jimmy O
