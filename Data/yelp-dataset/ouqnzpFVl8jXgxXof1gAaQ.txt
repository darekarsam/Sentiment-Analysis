1	I happened to be in town and a friend hauled me to this club. Let's be honest, I found the perfect way to waste 2 hours of my life. You may want to forget about this place. Thanks God I was invited and I did not pay the $15 cover charge.
4	This is one of the better clubs in Charlotte; I would say the best club for time they are willing to spend with you. The girls here are average to good in looks. There are some tattoos here. Safe to go alone here.This is one of the best in Charlotte, if you want to spend some quality time with the ladies. They are very friendly here and don't mind sitting and talking. Buy her a drink and of course they want to dance for you. So pull out some money when they offer to dance for you. There are some fun girls here in the afternoon, but most of them show up between 4pm and 7pm. It really has an amazing choice of ladies here in the evening.FYI: No smoking in any bar or restaurant anywhere in North Carolina. If they have a drink special it has to last all day... no happy hours. Sorry but it's NC law.
1	If I could give no stars I would. We went in about 10 or so.. Not one dancer was dancing, we stayed approx. 30-40 minutes and saw a total of 6 dancers. Half of those were probably 35+ years old. None of them conversated, and one walked in didn't even put her bag down and was like hey you want a dance. Seriously! The drinks were good but way expensive. The womens bathroom was horrible. Just not a place I would recommend. Thank God we didn't pay the $15 cover charge, they have free admission coupons on their website. so go see for yourself, but have a plan B
