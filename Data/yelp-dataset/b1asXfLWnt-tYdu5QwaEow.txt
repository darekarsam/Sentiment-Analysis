3	I'm actually surprised I'm the first one to review this CVS location. It always seems so busy. Store- Very clean and well stocked. Staff- Friendly and always willing to assist you. Pharmacy- This place is always busy, but hey try really hard to get your prescription out to you as soon as they can. My husband and I get all our prescriptions filled here and the Pharmacy staff has always been very helpful. What I love about CVS is that they have these new minute clinics, which is FAB! However, the times I've had to go to a minute clinic I've had to wait almost 2 hours just to see someone. This wouldn't have been that bad if I wasn't having to sit around with 3 and 5 year olds on a Saturday. Just imagine how sick you are with Bronchitis (didn't know at the time) and you have 3 and 5 year old little girls running circles around you screaming and Mom just sits there and reads her book. So not cool.... Only going to the minute clinic on weeknights or weekdays from now on. Lesson learned.
4	This pharmacy is always very busy but they have a lot of staff running hard to keep up with the demand. The store is clean and there is always someone to help you, unless you need to use the restroom.I find this at all of the box pharmacies though.I have used the minute clinic several times for minor issues and they have always been nice and helpful. The nurses will help you with over the counter remedies if you need them or shots and meds.They are always well stocked with items for every day types of needs.I recommend this store over others in the area.
3	This is a typical CVS. If you have been to one then you pretty much been to all of them. The only difference is that this location has a minute clinic. If you are not familiar with minute clinic, it is a great alternative to seeing your physician if you need small things like flu shots or if you have a cold. I do not recommend Minute Clinic if you are seriously sick.
