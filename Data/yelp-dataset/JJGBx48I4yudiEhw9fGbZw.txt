4	They have some pretty good food here and great service. I recommend their El Diablo breakfast pita as well as their albacore tuna. Breakfast bagel is also great here, and better priced than Einsteins. There loose leaf teas are also great!
4	Great coffee!   I'm a big fan of illy coffee and the espresso they seve here.  Lunch items like sandwiches,salads, pizzas, gyros, etc are also available, but are rather pricy.  Still its a good option if you're on the "m and g" meal plan at ASU  and need some grub while studying at the library.
1	The service here is SO poor. Lines backing up all the way into the Library, and the 2 employees only stand around and talk to one another. Its a 30 minute wait ANYTIME you go to get coffee. The girl just stands around and does nothing while the man works the register AND makes the drinks
