2	This Post Office isn't the greatest. The lines are usually ridiculously long and they usually only have 1-2 workers working at any given time. I wish people would learn how to use the automated machine in the lobby to ship things....or buy stamps. I have had a few bad experiences with this Post Office as well as far as not delivering mail, delivering mail to the wrong address, and not picking up packages when pick ups were scheduled. I run a little eBay business out of my home and chose not to ship USPS but to ship FedEx instead because of all the mistakes USPS makes.
5	one of the best -- if you never lived in a big city where they dont answer your calls or hang up on you when you call asking about information on a package then this is the place. I have called a couple of times every know and then to confirm packages they have them and either deliver next day or will come and you can go and pick up. There are lines just like every where else i.e. bank, groc store etc.
