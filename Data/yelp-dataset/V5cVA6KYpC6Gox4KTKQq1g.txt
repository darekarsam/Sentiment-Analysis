5	This is the BEST salon in the Valley. The owner Annie is AMAZING person and AWESOME stylist! I've been to many salons and had many hair cuts but never had the experience quite like Salon De Manila. They are a full service salon and nail spa. I love to relax in the masage chair while they do my nails. I never wax my eyebrow before but I trust Annie and had it done. it hurts but it looks great and I LOVE it! They are in the Pollack Plaza near Kiley's before Alma School and Warner intersection. Stop by or make an appointment. They'll take GREAT care of you. Better yet they'll make you look and feel AMAZING!

1	Please do not go to this salon.  This is very unprofessional salon.  The owner is very rude, she doesn't have any personality.  I was call to ask her schedule of her hairstylist and my phone was drop.  She looked at  her caller ID to get my number to call me back to threaten me because I hang up on her.  It was unbelievable.
