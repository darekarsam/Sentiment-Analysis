5	Was pleasantly surprised with this motel, the rooms are very clean.  The A/C is good and cold and the beds are comfortable.  The maid service is excellent!!  It appeared as though the room had been recently renovated, new paint, etc.  My family and I were very comfortable.  The fact that it offers a kitchenette and daily maid service is exceptional.  I would definitely recommend this place.
1	Stayed here for one night....Dissapointed that you get harassed by the crack heads in the adjacent "hood". When you tell management , they are apathetic. I am willing to give ALL business a shot but when you cant protect your paying customers, you are useless. Never again.  I'd never stay here unless they had ACTIVE security. Otherwise I wasted a night of pre-payment getting out of there.
