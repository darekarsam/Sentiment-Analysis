5	Chuck has been working on my cars since 1981.  For me, that's a whole lotta cars over the years.   Don't let the "hole in the wall" appearance fool you; they know cars, and will treat you like family.  The employees have been there forever.  They are prompt and exceedingly honest.  Their pricing is amazing, and if they can fix your car and save you money at the same time, they give you the options in plain English.  When possible, they'll give you the choice of used parts, reconditioned, or new.  If it's going to take a few days to fix the problem, they'll tell you up front.  You can count on an honest estimate and top notch service.  And you can always count on a friendly conversation and a laugh or two.
5	Pay attention now, this is the ONLY place in the Valley to take your car. The ONLY place.Honest, incredibly knowledgeable about vehicles, and very very reasonable. It doesn't look like much, actually, it looks like nothing, so if you need a latte and child care while your car is fixed, go somewhere else. If you want good repair work, honesty and a fair price, say it with me Yelpers--"This is the ONLY place."
5	Great Place! Honest and Great Work with Fair Prices. I was referred here by a relative and it is safe to say this place will be servicing my vehicles for years to come.
