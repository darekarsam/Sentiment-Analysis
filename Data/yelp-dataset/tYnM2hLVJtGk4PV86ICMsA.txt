1	The people that work here are lame . Don't act act they know stuff but they don't. All they do is trying to sell you extended warranty.  Even on a cable.
5	My Toyota smart key needed battery replacement. They had the correct battery in stock and Ryan helped me replace it and verify it was working before I left the store. Couldn't have been easier!
4	The staff is very friendly.  They go above and beyond to help the customers.  Knowledgeable about the products they offer in store.
