4	A great townhouse and apartment community. You can walk to all the restaurants on East Blvd, to Freedom and Sedgefield Neighborhood park. Marsh Properties is a great company to rent from. My only complaint is that both when I signed my initial lease and when I went in to renew I had to stop by multiple times to actually sign the updated lease. However they did not raise my rent when I resigned.
1	Salem Village Corton Drive Dilworh.  1 for great location.  A step back tonight 1995 when they were built. Popcorn ceiling and standard cheap beige carpet with linoleum in the bathrooms and kitchen. Very budget white countertops and cabinets throughout.  Master bath has yellow stains on the sink where it has been burned and the finish is coming off the mirror leaving it black. Master shower area not enough room to even turn around with the door open. This leaves you with a feeling of being in a cheap motel. None of the appliance are digital even the thermostat appears to be 25 years old.  Very tiny refrigerator with wire racks. Very poor drywall patching throughout the house you can still see the holes.  The balcony is splattered with white paint from the careless painters. $7 Ceiling light fixtures and very outdated brass chandelier in the dining area.  My move in maintenance request was submitted 3 weeks ago nothing has been done. All in all this makes me feel very unappreciated and unhappy about the whole situation.I  regret signing a one year lease. All in all the location is great if you can overlook the living conditions. :-(
