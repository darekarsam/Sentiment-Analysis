5	We tried the General Tso's chicken which was so crispy on the outside and yummy goodness of chicken on the inside, not too spicy - AMAZING. We also tried the house fried rice Tso Yon - awesome. The beef friend noodles, not so good. Highly recommend it, decor is cheesy cheap standard takeout Chinese restaurant type but the food is over the top.
3	Canadianized...but not too bad! typical Chinese food taste in the US or Canada, sweet, sour, sweet, and sour....that is it!
2	I was a tourist who did not realize this was a canadian\american style chinese restaurant, I saw roast pork on rice and thought it was hong kong style. it wasnt. i think the kitchen started to make roast pork fried rice and tossed it once i clarified what i wanted. they still dumped a bunch of corn starchy veggies on it. it was not what i wanted but it didn't taste that bad and was cheap.
