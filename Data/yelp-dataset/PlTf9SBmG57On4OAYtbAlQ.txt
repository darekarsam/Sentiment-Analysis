4	They did a great job in cleaning the poop in my backyard. Would have gave them 5 but was quoted to come between a certain time and didn't. But they did a good job.
5	I am THRILLED with my Dog-Poopy service! We live in the Spring Valley area (89146) and they come every morning. I wish I would have signed up for this years ago. My only complaint? They come around 5am... Which wakes up my dogs... Which wakes me up... Thankfully, I fall asleep quickly. I would totally recommend this service a friend!
4	i have been using them for close to a couple of yrs now and they are always there and do what needs to be done,the only issue i have is i get woken up at 6am on sunday my only day to sleep in...otherwise very happy with service...
5	I've been using the Poop Magician for about 5 years now. They're extremely reliable, prompt, and honest. They usually show up in the morning (sometimes really early in the summer to beat the heat). If you have dogs that bark, you might want to train them or plan ahead when you know they're scheduled. I couldn't be more pleased. I highly recommend this service if it's something you want. Great customer service and easy payment options. Great job! :)
5	Been using this company for a little over 5 years now.  They have me set up on a weekly service and couldn't ask for a more reliable company.  They have yet to miss a day!  My property is always left immaculate and left smelling fresh and clean as they use a deodorizer after clean up.   Thanks again for the seamless service guys!  Keep it up! Def a company I would recommend and I don't do that lightly.
