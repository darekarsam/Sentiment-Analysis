4	Clean. Doesn't smell like chemicals are everywhere. I've visited some salons where you cannot breathe. Seats for the pedicure are comfy and nice. The attendants are pleasant and they are knowledgable. I am very ticklish and they handled me with care and respect.
2	I didn't check the reviews before going in (I should have). The workers were pleasant and I enjoyed my hot stone massage. I wasnt too thrilled with the Polish job.  I probably won't go back.
