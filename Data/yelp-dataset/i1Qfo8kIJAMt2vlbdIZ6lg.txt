4	My partner was getting an endoscopy so while that experience itself could not be pleasant, this review is for the staff. The facility was clean and had a good sized waiting area. The front office assistant was very pleasant, and helpful.The nurses were efficient and helpful and even got him some orange juice to drink after the procedure and brought comfortable chairs and a blanket for the patient while we waited for our ride.
1	The surgeon was good, but the Anesthesiologist was a joke.  Full of himself.  Thought he was a top notch surgeon.  not impressed.
5	I had surgery here in February 2014. The facility was clean and spacious. The staff was magnificent in pre-op and post-op areas. I don't know anything about the surgery because I slept through the whole procedure. My recovery has been better than I ever expected, thanks to my surgeon and the staff at Seven Hills Surgery Center. If I ever need surgery again, I would not hesitate to return.
2	Wow you are at their mercy. Waiting 3 hours from check in to even be seen for preoperative.  No communication just told this is the way it is.... so far not impressed.
5	From the staff at the front desks to the folks in the back, amazing customer service. I've never felt more comfortable in a nervous situation with some medical tests. Thank you to Juanita and Jon and Dr Defonseka and the rest of the prep staff! -Kevin Manganaro
5	My son had surgery here today, and I have nothing but good things to say about this place! The receptionist was extremely nice, then when my son's nurse (Mary) took us to the back she made sure he was comfortable and made sure we were comfortable as well. All the nurses afterwards were outstanding as well. I definitely would recommend this place to friends and family.
