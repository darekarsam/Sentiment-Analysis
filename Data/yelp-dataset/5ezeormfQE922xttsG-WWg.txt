4	One of the only Japanese steakhouse left in Montreal, realy good
5	Le meilleure restaurant japonais de Montreal a ne pas manquer
3	Tapanaki! Yay! Our food was cooked right in front of us with a very entertaining chef who even sang to us. He was tossing and flipping the utensils and food. It was a good show. The portion was huge with plenty to eat.  Caution, your food might be set on fire and the flames may wow you. We were there on a week night and at closing we had to exit via the back door which included a "tour" of the kitchen due to entrance renovations by the front door. Overall it was ok.
