5	Ed was a lifesaver when our daughter's car was misdiagnosed by another garage as needing a new head gasket. We were about ready to send the car to the junkyard, but thought we'd see what it might cost to have it repaired. We had it towed to Ed's where he quickly discovered that all it needed was a new radiator. I'd recommend Ed's Auto Service to everyone!
4	Don't be put off by Eds personality, he does good work. I think its just the phone because hes much easier to talk to in person. He's got a nice little garage in a quiet part of town. I was told by the person who recommended me to him that Ed previously worked for a pontiac dealership which made me feel even better when choosing him because I owned a pontiac. He replaced my ignition switch and the job only took a few days til I had the car back. He did leave a little bit of grease on the upholstery, but it cleaned up easily.
5	I was referred to Ed for an AC compressor+condenser change by another highly rated mechanic on yelp last year. He did a great job and saved me about $400. About 2 weeks ago, my car was involved in a collision and was deemed a total loss by the insurance company. Even though the service was done almost a year ago, Ed was most kind and provided a copy of my original receipt to the insurance company. If you are looking for a trustworthy mechanic who can get the job done, Ed is the person you want to go to.
