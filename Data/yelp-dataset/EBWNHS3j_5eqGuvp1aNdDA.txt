4	Wonderful local Mom and Pop store which specializes in fruits and veggies.Everything inside is laid out and lit beautifully and you can tell that the staff here take pride in their work. With an emphasis on locally-grown Quebec produce in the summer, this shop also has dairy products, cheeses, breads, pasta, spices, honey and stir-fry sauces and marinades for sale.While selection isn't as wide as say Jean Talon market, for a small local spot, Vert Pomme has just enough to tide you over. I love stopping by here after work and picking up a few fresh odds and ends to get dinner going.Prices vary according to the seasonality of the produce, but in general are quite reasonable. While last month it was strawberries, it's corn season now, so they're practically giving it away.
