4	I love Schuh, it's is easily the best shoe shop in Edinburgh. Situated in a massive premises on Frederick St, they have a huge selection of delightful offerings for both men and women. Asides from stocking a lot of high profile labels (Adidas, Irregular Choice, Red or Dead, Ugg etc), they also have their own brand which successfully copies the latest trends, but retails for a cheaper price. There are always lots of helpful staff wondering around eager to help you on your quest to find the perfect pair and because the shop is so large, you can always find a seat in which to try things on. The student discount (10% off) and generous returns policy (you have 365, yes 365, days in which to change your mind) make this place a winner.
4	I find Schuh to be a very similar quality of shop to Office. This is no bad comparison.Like Office, a wide selection of shoe styles and brands are available which ensures everyone's tastes are catered for. The more formal styles are easily distinguishable from the casual thanks to a comprehensible layout. Unlike its South Bridge partner, this Frederick street Schuh is a little larger and thus offers a better selection of stock, which is always nice.
1	Although the shop seems great, once you are away from the shops and need help, their central customer service department are terrible. Also never use their online services, I bought a pair of shoes on sale and they refused to send them, refused to offer a like product and basically told me to get lost. I won't use them again. Good high street stores though.
