1	Stay far away from this Dr. The RUDEST office staff ever. Can't believe they think it's ok to treat seniors like this. Never ever going back. Had to give one star no other option.
3	Haven't been to an eye clinic since I moved here almost four years ago, not smart since I wear glasses. So I had a visit here. They have a self check in, once you're seated they will call you back for the co-pay. Then you sit down again with the other to wait for your turn. My turn actually came pretty quick. Over all I had a good visit, They did all of the testing. Needed a new prescription again. Very informative, and was willing to answer any questions needed. This will probably be my annual eye visit location.
5	So, we transferred to the Phoenix area 2 years ago and you know it goes; after we got here we wondered how we were going to find medical providers for all our different needs. Well, luckily I heard about this optometry clinic from colleagues. From day one I felt very welcomed by all the staff. Dr. Olivetti is very nice and extremely knowledgable and  professional. My wife and I go back each year for our annual exams and I'm going to be taking my parents after they move down this fall. I recommend this clinic and Dr. Olivetti without any reservation. Keep up the great work!
