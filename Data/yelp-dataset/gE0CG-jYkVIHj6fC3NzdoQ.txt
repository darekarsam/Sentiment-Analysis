5	Was in town for business and took four associates to dinner and  I must say, the food, wine list, service and atmosphere were all excellent!Advertised as a "Chain of One" it  is a must dine when in Charlotte.Also the owner Greg McIntosh came by our table to make sure everything was top notch (which it was).....a very nice touch.
4	Beautiful inside.  Great food.  Great atmosphere and I have to say this over and over and over again.  THIS IS NOT A CHAIN!!!!Next time you are out and you need to entertain for business, rethink the corporate usuals and give this place a go.  Well worth the short trip out of uptown.
5	Ate here one time and it was fantastic.  Steak was as good as I've ever had.  Sides were delicious.  Fantastic chocolate cake.  Must go back.  Worth the price.
5	McIntosh's is closing and will be greatly missed________________________________________________________  Dear Friends of McIntosh's, It is with great sadness that I have closed our restaurant after 13 years of business.  The increased competition and economy was the driving factor in this business decision. I want you to know how much I appreciated your patronage and support through the years.  I know many of you celebrated life's great milestones at our restaurant.  For that we are grateful.  I know McIntosh's will live on forever through those memories.  They were special times for us as well.  I could not have made it through these years without our amazing staff.  I owe our success to them. So, let's raise a glass to the future.  I hope our paths will cross again. Very tuly yours,Greg McIntosh and the entire staff of McIntosh's Steaks & SeafoodMcIntosh's Steaks & Seafood is located at:1812 South BlvdCharlotte, NC 28203Phone: 704.342.1088Fax: 704.335.0063
