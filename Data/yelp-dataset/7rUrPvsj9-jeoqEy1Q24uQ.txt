5	Steve is as good as his word. His work is exemplary. He is fair and willing to work around budget issues to get the job done is an expedient way, when the customer can best afford to have the work done. He then shows you all he's done and lets you test the keys he's made, to make sure they all work perfectly. I recommend him highly.
5	I broke a key in the door lock of a metal security door and my front door was rendered useless.  I called and Steve came out within hours.  While he was here I also had him fix another lock that was sticking.  His work was quick, efficient, and effective.  His prices were as quoted and very reasonable.  It is refreshing to have an honest professional who is quick and good at his job.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
5	I had Steve replace the locks on my new home. Of all the vendors for different services I have had to get done, his stands out the most so far. He was quick, professional, courteous, and fair. I would recommend him to anyone.
