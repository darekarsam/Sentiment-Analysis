3	Though I'm not a Starbucks fan, this was it. That's all there is for coffee in Montreal. So- I have to hit up the busiest shop on my way to my training meeting every morning. The lobby/line area is not big enough for all the customers. But the staff is friendly and fast. And everything is in French- so it's weird to say American-Italian coffee drinks in French.....huh? Confusing.
3	Reviewers have really lambasted this Starbuck's.  I've been here a few times and have never had any serious issues.  Seating is limited, but that seems to be par for the course at Montreal based Starbuck's.  It's located in a high-traffic area for the 9 to 5 business crowd, but slightly hidden from the weekend shoppers on St. Catherine.  I went on the weekend and found a nice place to rest for a bit.I was there long enough that I wanted to refill my coffee.  Unfortunately they were out of what I wanted, but the guy serving me made it right by giving me a small bag of coffee I could take home and brew myself.
3	The location of this Starbuck's is good for me. It is off the beaten track so it rarely is full, I can browse the internet while I wait for whomever I am meeting (that's my primary purpose for going to this location) and I never have had any issues with the coffee, but I don't do fancy, just straight up coffee for me.
2	The waiting time was unexceptionally long, I was the only person in line and it took them 12 minutes to give me a Cappuccino and Green Tea Frappuccino.The Frappuccino had too many squirt of vanilla syrup in it, so it tasted no where near green tea but instead like vanilla.The barista was also very clumsy, she spilled juices and ice cubes all over the counter and took more time wiping them off than actually preparing my drinks.I don't recommend this place, as there are 7 other Starbucks within a radius of 500m.
5	I always get my Grande Hazelnut/Caramel Macchiato  here, fast service, Starbucks legendary culture on point!
