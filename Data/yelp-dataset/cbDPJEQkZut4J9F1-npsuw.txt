Other people are nuts (like myself) and want to do the job themselves to get a great workout and save a few bucks. The employees here are knowledgable and glad to help out people who fall into either category. Several other nuts stopped in when I was there. I picked up close to a 1/2 ton of 3/4" gravel and 500lbs of boulders for $70... using my own truck saved a $60-80 delivery fee (a sheet of plywood helps if your pickup's bedliner is corrugated). Its addictive... already planning a return trip.

A bunch of our neighbors had these cool looking river rock streams in their front yard  landscaping and we wanted to do that ourselves as we'll as fill our pool water feature bowls with river rocks for just that right dribbling sound.So, while slightly intimidating driving in to the lot with large dump trucks, the folks in the shop very helpful describing what a half ton of rocks looks like in bathtub measurement terms. So, after deciding we needed a bathtubs worth of rocks, they sent us over to their lot to pick up the rocks. We drove over next to the pile of rocks we wanted and the tractor came over, scooped a large bucket full of rocks and in a large cloud of dust, dumped into the back of the truck. So fun, by the way. So, how they decide what to charge you is decided by weight. They weigh your vehicle before you drive in, then have you drive in the scale again on the way out. Also fun. I think we maybe paid 30 bucks, so worth it!
