5	Really good value if you can get into Edinburgh from here - much, much more comfortable, modern accomodation than you will find elsewhere for the money. Similar vibe to the W chain in the US if you are familiar with that - the restaurant focuses on fresh fish and was quite full, so book in advance if you want to try it. Next to a grocery store if you have any requirements for snacks/fruit etc. for the room. I'd definitely stay here again if the opportunity arose.
4	A masculine decor with pleasant staff. They are always willing to appease clients. Quaint and very quiet rooms. Room service food is upper cuisine quality. Presentation is refreshing with attention to detail.
