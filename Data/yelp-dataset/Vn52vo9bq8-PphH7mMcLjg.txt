5	For perspective, I usually fall asleep in a Dentists chair, so my mileage may vary from yours.Dr. Gibbons EARNS that!  He is a particularly good Dentist.  His work is technically very good, and his work is esthetically beautiful.  I know of at least one person who went to him with a chipped tooth, and he repaired the tooth so well the patient CAN'T REMEMBER which tooth was broken!!!!You get what you pay for, and Dr. Gibbons earns his money.The only downside is that they don't take insurance.
5	Dr Gibbons finally saved me after some lousy experiences with other dentists since moving to Phoenix 5 years ago.  If you want the best care and not a price-gouger or impersonal PPO clinic-style outfit, better see either Dr. Gibbons or an alternate referral they would gladly give you, since they're such an incredibly nice office staff. His in-office periodontal maintenance   is also very reasonable. Billing estimates ahead are clear and detailed-- I trusted them so completely that I paid everything in advance, and they promptly issued me a $500 credit for overpayment, which I held rather than take their cash refund.  Dr Gibbon even performed a filling for no-charge after discovering it during his other work.  Finally, you will be in great care with Dr. Jacqueline Allen, Endodontist, if a root canal is needed prior to crown.
5	I have been a patient of Dr. Gibbons since July 2007.  Both he and his staff are extremely knowledgeable, courteous, professional, efficient, and helpful.  They are very accommodating to my schedule when making appointments.  I highly recommend Dr. Gibbons.
