5	I cannot believe how awesome this company is! After being given the runaround by other roofing companies, I called Danny and he had someone out there to fix my roof within hours. Even though it was a small job, he wanted to help. No job to big or small for this company! Fantastic prices too!
5	Came home from vacation with tiles falling off our roof...called and Danny had his brother there pronto.  Repair was minor and price was extremely fair.  So glad to know to look on Yelp to check out reviews and get the best.Thanks!
5	After the BIG rain, we had a small leak....One of the neighbors was using Az Finest roofing, so we tried their service.The crew was excellent, fast, and the leak was gone after a very fast andefficient problem fix.  The crew chief was David and the crew was great.We recommended to a neighbor, who also thinks highly of the crew and co.
