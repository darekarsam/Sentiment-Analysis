4	They sell Cirepil wax!
5	Heather was so helpful. I stopped in without my license and Heather looked it up on the computer, matched the information to my DL, and off I went. This store is clean and well organized, and right on my way to work! Thankfully they are close enough to my Salon, if I had an emergency (hair dressers NEVER run out of color!) I could be there in minutes. FANTASTIC!
1	This is based on my last trip to the store. I was sent to the store from cosmoprof to pickup the igora metallic. The associate was not helpful at all, she was actually insulting. After I asked what developer was needed for the metallics because I did not want to have to make a second trip and it was also a new product to me and I like to be certain. she rudely replied with "do you even do hair?" First off Paula, why else would I be on your store, secondly how else could I complete my purchases and lastly how else would I know your other associates? So now I would like to ask you Paula, "do you even retail?" Because I get better customer service at the gas station and your product knowledge is inadequate.
