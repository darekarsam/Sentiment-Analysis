1	Twice, I've dropped in to German Baked Specialties on King Street in Waterloo. There won't be a third time. And it isn't because of their baked specialties.The first time, I didn't actually try any Baked Specialties. Two people were being served by the three people behind the counter. We were the only three people at the counter, so I should have been next. Two more people arrived, stood at the outside corner of the counter and started speaking German. Instantly all attention was focused on them. I waited five minutes while the newcomers were served. Then other people arrived and attention went to them. Try as I might, I could not catch the eye of any server in the place. I ended up leaving without trying any of their wares. Perhaps I was invisible that day.The second time, I was the only person in the place. I got a coffee and a slice of cake served in disposable plate, cup, fork, spoon. Disposables. In a place with crystal chandeliers, upholstered high back chairs, with a glowing fireplace.When finished, I asked where the washroom was. I was directed to the Starbucks across the street. I find it difficult to understand how a place that provides tables and chairs does not offer a washroom for customer use. Is that even legal? How do you wash your hands before or after eating?Next time, I'll get my snack at Starbucks.
5	It is a very small and cozy place. We have work group meeting in this coffee shop.. the staff was very friendly and their sandwiches are really good..It s very hard to miss as it is a very narrow store. I found out that their products (bread) are shipped from germany...and they are baked on a daily basis. I tried a little bit of  their chilli special and it was really good
