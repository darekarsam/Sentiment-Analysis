5	Leave no hair behind!  I was pleasantly surprised with my Brazilian last week from Diana.  She is clearly an experienced professional who knows how to make you feel comfortable.    When I arrived (early) she was with a client but came out to greet me and offer me water.  The office is very clean and her room was so peaceful I almost fell asleep waiting for her to come back in.  The service itself was extremely painless, I actually looked down a few times to makes sure she was actually removing hair! She was meticulous, thorough, and friendly all things I look for in an esthetician.  Also her prices are dead on with her competition, which is really a steal for her high quality of work!
5	I found Bloom Skin Care on Groupon and since my last name is Bloom I thought it was a sign. Diana is amazing and I couldn't be happier. I'm not able to come in as often as I like, but when I do it's always a good experience. I highly recommend Bloom Skin Care.
5	Diane is awesome! I had the absolute best facial there! I need to get back in, it has been way to long.  She is truly a professional and your skin will look and feel immediately better. I would highly recommend a visit!
