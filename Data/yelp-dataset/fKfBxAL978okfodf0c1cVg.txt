5	I've been a loyal Michelle client for over 10 years! She went from a "regular salon" to renting her own space in DC Salon! Manicures, acrylics, eye lash extensions, waxing, gel-- she does it all! And she is the best at a reasonable price!!
5	It's a really great place to get your nails and your kids' nails done for special events or just for fun! And she's really cheap compared to other nail technicians in or outside of DC Salon.
5	Michelle is great at eyelashes and very nice. She really takes her time and does an excellent job
5	Michelle is wonderful!  I have a monthly appointment for a mani-pedi and enjoy it so much. She is so friendly yet professional. Her salon is extremely clean and I see her cleaning her instruments as she goes so I never worry about sanitation. Prices are more than reasonable. You won't be disappointed!!
