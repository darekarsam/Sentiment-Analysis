4	This is one of those small, ethnically specific stores where you can find just about anything that the big grocery stores don't have.  It's a very nice little store that has all the spices and various odds and ends you might need for that new recipe you're trying.I mention this establishment because it does have something that sets it apart from the rest.  If you have read some of my other reviews you've probably noticed that I am a fan of asian food, and this goes double for asian candy.  This store has a larger and more diverse candy and snack section than any other market I've been to.  From sweet to salty they have it all.  The only problem I have with this place is that they don't have mochi and I love that stuff.  Other than that, it's a great place to explore and try something new.
1	This place sucks!!! We bought rice there, and we found there were hundreds of rice worms inside the rice bag. As we returned to the store the next day, the owner of the store already knew that there were worms in the rice and he recommended us to buy Korean rice. What the heck??? Now it's been more than 1 week since then, there are still worms inside my apartment...We are really pissed!
5	I'm giving this place 5 stars because it's the only Korean grocery store in Charlotte that carries Korean whiskey, Korean beer, Korean porn and Korean biblical wall art. Now that's ballsy!
