5	I got an amazing deal on my refrigerator at Handy. Ron and his employees are very friendly and knowledgeable about all of their products they sell and service. I'm a customer for life.
4	First of all, the address is incorrect. They have moved to west Main Street (right by the drive-through liquor store, yes that is a landmark for me). We went to this place first a few years ago when it was time to replace our disco era appliances but found a much better deal elsewhere. I wish I had the dough to only buy from local businesses, even when they are considerably more expensive, but I'm not there yet. Then, a few weeks ago we noticed that our fridge water wasn't good. Not poisonous, but not delicious. Apparently the filter was to blame. I tried looking around online but was amazed at the variety (also the shipping charges). I figured I'd see if Handy Appliance could order it for us or something. I knew it would be expensive from my online research but was at least hopeful that I would be able to return it easily if there was a problem. When did I become so cynical? I walked in the door at Handy Appliance, was greeted immediately (there were four people at the desk behind the front counter), and ended up walking out five minutes later with two filters (they come in a 2-pack) for a verrrrrry reasonable price. We managed to get a refrigerator with the most common filter - yippee! Now we have tasty fridge water again, and I learned a valuable lesson about making easy tasks difficult (to summarize: don't).
5	I've used Handy to service my Affinity dryer and my Whirlpool refrigerator. I like that they usually send the same tech. Rates are reasonable and the staff is friendly. No complaints!
