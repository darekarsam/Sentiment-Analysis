3	This location isn't my "home" Fry's, but it is the closest to my sister's, so I will occasionally shop here. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing outstanding. My only slight complaint is that once, I asked to purchase a bundle of wood from the stack out front. The cashier said she doesn't normally work at that store, so she went outside to check which one it was, and came back with a Duraflame log. Since that was not it, she went back out again...even when I told her I was pretty sure it's the same as the ones stacked along the wall inside the store. Oh well.
1	This is the worst Frys Store of all. The rotessorie chicken are totally gross. Not only was there blood on the breast area,but the taste was disgusting. The manager seemed like he could care less when we returned it. So much for decent customer care. I will definitely not shop there again!
5	I LOVE this store.  By far the sweetest and friendliest employees of any Arizona Frys I have been to. We live in Seattle and shop at a sister store (QFC) and this isn't even the closest location or even the closest grocery store to my mums house in Sun City. Yet, every single time I come in (usually 5+ times every visit to Arizona) they are sweet,  polite, engaging in conversation with me and my 3 year old. I would not shop here, if it wasn't for the employees.  Sometimes they don't have what I want or the best price on an item (employees don't have control over that) but the kindness of the employees keep me coming back. For the bad reviews, saying bad service. .. sorry but I suggest you look in the mirror and see if isn't maybe a bit of how you approach them, or maybe you never worked in retail and never had a bad day. Hands down, this is the best Arizona location.
