5	Purchased a Hill Injection a year and a half ago and have been doing high end detailing ever since, incredible machine, unfortunately it did take a week or so to get used to the new process but after that there's no looking back. Thanks Sebastien and Brent for your advice and help throughout the process. Looking forward to getting a 220V unit next.
5	Amazing little machine to steam clean your ceramic tiles and grout (and a lot of other uses). Industrial quality at consumer prices.  Highly recommended!
5	I have been using a Dupray steam cleaner for residential use for about a year now and I must say it completely changed my cleaning routine. I use it on virtually every surface in my house and it does an amazing job. It delivers great results on floors and its particularly helpful in the kitchen. It was a bit expensive but I guess thats what you have to pay for commercial quality. The guys over there are really sweet and always ready to help. I called them a couple of times and they took time to answer all my questions and make sure I was happy with my purchase. Top quality equipment and amazing customer service!
