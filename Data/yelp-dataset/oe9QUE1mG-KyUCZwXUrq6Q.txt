5	This is simply the best papa johns around.  The pizza is always consistent and they exceed where others fail by making sure your order is correct. I have found this store to be much friendlier and cleaner than the others.
5	Simply put this is the best Papa Johns in Charlotte.  Consistently good pizza and great service!
5	Just ordered pizza here today while visiting friends in the area. OMG!!! The gm of this place was courteous, friendly, professional, but above all WOW WHAT OUT OF THE WAY! OLD FASHIONED SERVICE! I received! How refreshing!! When the $'s mean nothing to most restaurant managers these days!  Or maybe it was because he was older and remembers what real service is and really appreciated earning our money! I was offered plates, napkins even though they were on the counter, and he held the door for us as we left the store with our pizzas.
5	yummy, love it,  my kids love it,,,
