5	Very clean and friendly staff to help you. Wasn't busy at the time I was there. Staff was efficient and completed my request very quickly and even offered me an alternative way to send money.
1	I stopped in for a title loan amd their commercial says 15 minutes. I was there for over 2 hours waiting. They need to change their commercials. False advertisement
5	This location is close to home and the staff is great. As soon as you walk through the door they greet you with a friendly welcome. The manager Roz is wonderful! She is very helpful and always goes the extra mile. There are some times when it gets busy but they are all about customer service and they will take care of you! I wouldn't go anywhere else!
