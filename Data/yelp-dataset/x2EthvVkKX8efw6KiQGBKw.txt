4	A small, well-edited shop. For men and women.At first glance it looks like *just* a vintage clothing store. Still, it was interesting enough looking to pop in on our walk down St. Laurent.Come to find out it's vintage, and reconditioned - the owner Mark takes vintage items and updates them - I believe they may have a few one-off handmade items too.Anyway, great variety of sizes and styles, which is sometimes hard to find in vintage/reconditioned. Scored a very cute polka dot halter on the $10.00 rack too. Gotta love that!Overall the price point was decent, but frankly the dresses I bought were so cute I wasn't really comparison shopping. I *think* they ran me between 30-45 canadian bucks.Note: Takes CC cards but offered me a deal for paying in cash.Take the time to pop in. If you don't find anything for you that day, the owner is great eye-candy and super nice.
5	I'm in Montreal for about a month, and stumbled on Cul De Sac in my Saint-Laurent neighborhood.  Normally I'm very picky, but have found several great vintage shirts here at very good prices.  I've worked with Melissa, who is very friendly and knowledgeable.   Many women's clothes, But they have a great selection for men.  I know I will return before leave Montreal.   Near schwartz's, too.
4	Scored some great sweaters on the $10.00 rack one time, although it could be a hit or miss depending on the day, but everything is very clean and repaired which is good.
