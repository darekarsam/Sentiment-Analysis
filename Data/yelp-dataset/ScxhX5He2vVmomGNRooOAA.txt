1	Wouldnt want to go there unless u want rat shit on ur plate!
5	Went here based on good reviews and was extremely satisfied. We were a group of several ladies and requested the chef choose a variety of plates for us to share and he kindly complied. The flavors were spot-on and the service friendly. I would not recommend this restaurant for large groups as it is quite small.
4	Went here with my wife on our 10 year wedding anniversary based on reviews/recommendations.  The food was very tasty but the atmosphere was rather bland and the kids running around was not the romantic environment I was seeking.  That said, I would go there again for take-out next time I'm in town.
