5	Absolutely beautiful hike! 8 mile drive off road.  It's a beautiful hike, it's a little bit of a climb to the saddle, so make sure to bring plenty of water.  If you start in the morning you'll be in the shade most of the hike up.  There are plenty of places to stop and catch your breath if you need it.  It's a little windy when you get to the saddle, but the view is absolutely beautiful!  It's good for the dogs as well!
5	I've hiked these trails a couple times and I remember both times as if I hiked them yesterday. First time was a night hike - quite dangerous once the sun sets but gorgeous nonetheless. The second, we followed a longer trail with the sun blazing. Rocks were gorgeous, the sky so blue, much like a painting on blue canvas. The trail is out in the middle of nowhere it seems but very much worth visiting.
5	I have hiked Peralta trails about 10 times now and I love it. Not recommended for a night hike at all but perfect for a beautiful day hike. I would say this is a moderate hike.
