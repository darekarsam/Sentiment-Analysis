5	I used Luis for a repair on a rental property, which went smoothly. I have since recommended him to several friends, they were as was I, quite pleased that he was a straight forward honest guy. My repair was done the same day I called, which kept my tenant happy;
5	Luis has done several jobs for us at Del Sol Furniture and we are very happy with his work. He is fast, same day if you need it. He is knowledgeable and honest. We plan on using ASAP for all of our properties. Keep up the good work Luis!
5	Want your AC maintenance or checked? Luis is the man! Good work and great price.Called - same day service call to check my AC unit. Not only checked, he also completed the necessary work to have the unit working at it's full potential. Haven't had any problems with the unit ever since.I definitely would recommend him to anyone looking for AC work at a great price. Give him a call.
