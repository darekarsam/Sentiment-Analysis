1	I have given this establishment a nickname after eating here.  The "papago's crapfe grill and barf emporium."  Your one stop shopping for a wide array or tasteless overpriced crap that is pushed off as "food."  Eating the food here is similar to most experiences I have had at the DMV.  The selection is terrible, I can generally find more food to eat at a Toys R us than I can find here.  I wish this place served alcohol so I could get drunk enough to be able to choke down this prison grade crap.  The only satisfaction I get when I have eaten here is trying to throw away some of their very limited condiments or a food tray.  The people working here have the personality of robots (like one in an auto manufacturing plant, not the cool funny one Johnny Five from the movie "Short Circuit")If your stuck working in the building it is located in, you are limited for options around there.  I would suggest going out to your car and eating the upholstery on your seat.  It will be a much more rewarding experience for you.DO NOT eat at the salad bar.  Unless you have 2-3 hours later in the day to spend in the can.  Make sure to bring a snowcone to wipe your ass with afterwards.  You think I am kidding?  I dare you to tempt fate if you think I am fabricating this fact.  The daily specials they have are also a good indicator of what is about to spoil the next day.To sum up my eating experiences at the papago's cafe grill & deli is much like having the UPS man deliver a long awaited package of disappointment.  Plus the prices suck ass beyond belief.
