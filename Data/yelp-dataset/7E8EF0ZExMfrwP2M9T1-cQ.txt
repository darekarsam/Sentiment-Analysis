4	I am simply writing this review because this medical office has never failed my family.We use the Skypoint and buffalo office in the Northwest/Centennial Hills area and have been very satisfied with our services. I personally have seen both Dr . Mark and Dr. Clark both seem knowledgeable and have helped in my own times of need.  I have been there for simp thing's and also things that sometimes seemed complicated.  Dr Mark has performed small surgical procedures in his office for me. I had a cyst removed from my chest being female it was akward for me and he was professional and did a great job in leaving very minimal scar visible. The convenience is amazing! I would also like to note that Dr Mark is a DO not a general physician so your in very good hands... Nothing bad to say. Not feeling good? Go on and give them a try you will be seen even on a walk in basis- They do close for lunch though-- happy health!!
1	Too busy of a schedule to wait an hour to be seen by the doctor.  Some of us need to keep our jobs and this clinic is just not accommodating, no early/late a appts no weekends and super long wait time, need to find another doctor for my dad!
1	My appt was for 10 am and I'm still waiting.   It's now 11 am.  What's the point of making an appt??
1	Long time of waiting why do u male an appointment if take you over 2 hr to be seen? Nice people nice doctors but ...they can't  make appointments ... need to find a different doctor...not everyone has over 2 hr time to spend at waiting room...my app was at 11 am now is 1:20 pm and i have not been seen yet ...this is a joke.... not professional!!##
5	I'm a patient of Dr. Leslie Denton. I go to the office in Seven Hills. Dr. Leslie is the best. Sites patient. SHE LISTENS! When was the last time your Dr did that? ;-) The staff here is wonderful as well. I am always treated with respect :)
