5	The best dance school in the area! My daughter LOVES going to class every week. The staff is very knowledgable and professional and most importantly great with the kids. I can't imagine sending my daughter to a better studio than Starz in Motion.
5	Great staff! Great classes!  Great studio!  My daughter LOVES her Cheer/Pom class.  Miss Alexa is full of energy,  fun and great with the kids.  Lindsay,  the owner is so friendly and so welcoming.  Starz In Motion is a MUST for any dancer, any age!
5	This has been the best experience my 4 year old has ever had with any organized activity. She is very shy and timid around most teachers/coaches/instructors but not at Starz in Motion! She warmed up to Miss Megan quickly and LOVEs going to dance every week! I have been very happy with every class she has attended and absolutly love every teacher I have met! I'd recommend Starz in Motion for any age or type of dance. All the kids leave with a huge smile on their face!
5	My son daughter love Starz in Motion.   They look forward to going each week.  The facility is top notch, teachers are wonderful and the kids have such a great time.  They make learning dance steps fun.  Our family loves Starz in Motion!!!
