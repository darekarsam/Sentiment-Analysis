5	Ok Darren, you were right. I was against comming to this gem of a place when you pushed me into it....and I love you even more for it!  When we first walked in I wasn't sure what I'd be in for. There was a strong smell of burnt potato in the air and few patrons. The menu was small, and I looked at Darren in a way that said "all breakfasts are the same!" Man was I proven wrong! I ordered the biggest breakfast on the menu, as I was hungry, and am happy to report I left will a satisfied belly.  I have nothing to complaine about! From me, that is VERY rare (as my boyfriend can tell you). The toast was 2 very thick slices of the rye bread I ordered. I was also offered an apricot jelly! Sooo good! Everything was cooked (grilled) to perfection! The bacon wasn't burnt nor limp and greasy, and the homefries were perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft and steamy on the inside. I am very impressed that there was no residue from the grill in the food. After chatting with the owners, I came to learn that they offer catering. The rates are on the website. I may very well have them cater for a bridal shower I have to throw for my friend.Oh, and the iced tea is fresh brewed. BONUS!!!
