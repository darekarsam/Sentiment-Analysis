2	Daily Illini - Has gotten better recently, but its a crap paper altogether. The stories are poorly written and usually cite Facebook as reference. Most articles are obviously biased, and the op ed staff is full of full blown morons.WPGU - Best radio station in town, but still a bad radio station. They play some indie songs, but its really obvious they try to be indie by playing really cliche songs many times. Also, the DJ's are inept.Technograph - eh.The Buzz - Only reason this is getting 2 stars. Good local music reviews, and a good crossword. This and the booze news are the only things worth reading while siting at Antonio's eating lunch.
3	Meh. I've experienced better student run publications. Working here wasn't the greatest experience + most stories aren't locally relevant.
