5	I personally know the owner, Phil. His vision and work ethic for Clean Air Lawn Care Charlotte will undoubtedly make it a huge success!
5	Our lawn has never looked better!  Phil is an AWESOME guy and would highly recommend!
5	Talk about great customer service paired with sustainable practices. You'll get both when doing business with Clean Air Lawn Care. They are a power team of two arriving in good spirits to bring goodness to your lawn. They offer fertilizing treatment throughout the year, mowing, and clearing leaves. The equipment they use is mainly solar powered so both you and your neighbors can rest easy that your yard is getting maintained without all the loud noise like the gas-guzzling equipment makes. The owner communicates regularly on how they treat your lawn via detailed emails, which I appreciate since I know nothing about yard care. If you are looking to support a local business, support sustainable practices, and not do it yourself, call Clean Air Lawn Care.
