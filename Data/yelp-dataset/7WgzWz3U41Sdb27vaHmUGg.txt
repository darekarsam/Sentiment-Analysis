5	On a friend's recommendation, I recently used P K Jewelry Repair to 'remodel' my wedding set and upgrade the size of the center diamond.  The results were stunning and at a very reasonable cost.  The work is done without sending it out so my creative ideas were used and they were thoughtful about things I didn't even consider that made my ring stronger and more beautiful than ever!
5	He's great! Kind, efficient, and did exactly what I wanted, which was to fix a broken necklace chain and shorten the necklace at the same time. Fair prices, too. He didn't call me when it was ready--not sure if that's the policy. I just went back after a week to pick it up. Great experience!
5	He is great, kind and vey helpful!  He did a great job on fixing my husband wedding ring. He said it would be done in 2 hours, and yes it was done.  I will use him again and recommended him to everyone. It is nice that the ring did not have to leave to be repaired!!
