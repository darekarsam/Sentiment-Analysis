5	This place is the best.  It is situated in the bottom floor of  the office tower on the corner of Goldwater and Camelback where I work. The owner is named George and he and  his family take great care of all of us employees in the office tower and the attached mall (fashion square).  George and his kids make sure to know everybody's name and greet you with a smile every time you come through the door.They serve breakfast food including burritos, bagels, and french toast.  For lunch they have a full menu of sandwiches, a couple of soups a day and some salads.  They also have prepackaged snacks, gum and drinks to keep us workers going throughout the day.Of course, as the name would suggest they also serve coffee, teas, and your usual fancy coffee drinks.  They seem to make a point to try to remember what your usual order is as well.  My company gets breakfasts and lunches catered from here and even if we end up with a last minute order for bagels for 10 people, they always try to accommodate us.  The food is good, filling and served from people who really care about making their customers happy.

5	When I worked in the mall I always ate at George's.  It is a bit of a challenge to find unless you're in on the know, though.  There is a lot of variety on the menu - some of my favorites are the pastrami, Gaby's Favorite and the el Jefe Burrito.  I always get the Chai Tea but if you are into coffee or smoothies they have that too (but try the Chai Tea!).
