3	Well supplied too bad the guy working in the store didn't know anything about paint. Bright colors wide selection clean store but if you want any help keep driving to ace, the Home Depot or lowes  because all three give much better customer service than this store
1	If you need paint matched, don't bother stopping at this store, because the employees clearly have no training and have no business working in a paint store.  Took in a can of paint, needed it matched but made to a flat, the other guy told the girl (who helped me) what can to get. She started working.  About 10 minutes later she showed the paper she used with the original paint on it, and then with the flat color with it.  She admitted it wasn't quite the same color but she could keep adding tint to it.  I said you are right it doesn't match, but I am not going to stand here while you try and figure it out.  She then had the nerve to put the color on the lid of the container she had been working on and wanted me to pay for it,  seriously!!!!  I said I'm not paying for a color that you admitted DOES NOT match the can I brought in.  She said you asked me to do it.  I said too bad you can't mix paint like you are supposed to, give me MY original can back so I can leave!!  That store does not deserve the JD Power awards that is so proudly stuck to the front door!!!!!    Sherwin Williams needs trained employees in their store!!!
