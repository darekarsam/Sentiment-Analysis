4	Love their in house craft brews! The Ipa was inexpensive and very tasty. The food was great too. The best fried pickles I ever had.
3	Good drink specials food was alright for bar food. Spicy fried pickles were pretty good. It was pretty slow for a Friday night I thought. Lots of TVs, perfect place to go watch a game. I will be returning.
3	It would be a great place to watch a game if the jukebox music wasn't up so loud. There are tvs at the booths with sound so it would be awesome if I could actually hear it. Too bad - wont be back.
5	Great staff!! Super friendly!! Good food!Very reasonable prices!  Great place to go watch a game!  Casual!
5	Cheap drinks and good food.  Ask for Bruiser just don't look her directly in the eyes.
3	This may be the nicest looking (on the inside) hole in the wall place I have been to. We came here twice recently for Sunday football with a friend who lives down this way. This place is pretty basic... reasonably priced bar food (wings special on Sundays) and 2-3-4 drink specials everyday. I suppose most people are regulars. They are some loud football fans (ok, maybe just one very loud female patron who would scream and curse at the most obscure game). I personally was very happy with their $6 grilled cheese with tomato soup special. Especially the soup. It was savory and creamy. I would just drink a pot of that if I could.It is a decent neighborhood spot. Probably does not worth a special drive (unless you're down this way for cheap gas). And keep your drink order simple, it is a bar, not a lounge, stick with beer, or something with coke/tonic.
3	Great simple bar. Servers have a heavy hand which is always welcomed. Food is better than decent for bar food. Cheap drinks, usually a good crowd. I hadn't been in almost a year and they all remembered how I took my drinks. 3.5 stars.
