5	This is my first time at this location.. I really like the new location.. It's a lot bigger, stores every where and places to grab something to eat before during or after.. It is kind of far from me but I still like the area.. Ivonne is my go to for all my hair needs!! She is the bomb.com!!
5	I came here following my favorite hairstylist Briana, it's a great new place! I'm definitely coming back!
