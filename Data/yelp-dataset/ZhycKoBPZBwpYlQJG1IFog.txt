5	Everyone here is really nice and take there time with you. They didnt have a game I wanted that was pretty old but they found a store near by that had it and had it sent over.The prices are pretty good.
5	This store will forever be my store Charley and Bruce and all the personnel that work here are very knowledgeable and are quick and helpful when it comes to making decisions as well as helping you get the newest inside content on the games I love the store and the people here are amazing
2	Stopped in today and saw that the Wii games were all on a display that said 14.99 or less. I picked a few out. Hey, the Wii U will play them. Why not. Lady at the counter said that super smash bros was 27.99. I asked about the three large 14.99 or less signs and she said that it's the only display they have but the games are all regular price. Apparently they have never heard of false advertising or covering up misleading signs. I won't be back to this gamestop. Even after I brought it to her attention, her so-what attitude made my son and I leave immediately.
4	My boyfriend and I went here on Black Friday. He bought a new Nintendo DS, which included 2 games,1 that we did not even expect to get, and it was all on sale in a bundle together!!! Ahh! The employees are very knowledgable, especially the girl who helped us out. She's got piercings and bangs. I did not catch her name unfortunately, but she was a sweetheart. We will definitely go there again.
