4	I have never been on a diet or tried eating healthy before... My friend Jared referred me and I lost 10 pounds! I wasn't trying lose a lot of weight but I wanted to get in shape for pool season. The only reason I didn't give Isagenix a full 5 stars is because it is expensive! But I feel great! Look great and am not dependent on caffeine anymore!
5	I am sold on Isagenix i am NOT an Associate or am i trying to sell it to anyone, i am not in the business although i once was i just couldn't afford to stay on the Autoship every month.  I do still buy my chocolate shakes from them and buy certain other products but i will not try to sell it anymore because it really was difficult trying to help people get healthy or lose weight.
4	I've used their products for my family for a couple years.  I ended up becoming an associate just to get a better price.  I haven't sold their products to anyone else, but we use them ourselves.  I use the shakes and vitamins.   They seem to work well for us and taste good.
5	If I could give these products and the company a 10 Star Review, I definitely would!  I have been a product of the product since June 1, 2006 and have been sharing the opportunity ever since.  It is difficult to explain to people how much their life will improve once they begin to get the right kind of nutrition into their body every day but the best way I can describe it is to say that once you start this system, you stop craving junk food, you have better clarity of mind, your focus is better, life feels so abundant.If you are thinking of giving these products a try, please follow your instinct and do so.  The company offers a 30-Day money back guarantee... what have you got to lose besides fatigue?
1	Beware.
