4	Having been here 2 years ago we strived to find the cafe again for our pre-drive home breakfast.  There is a spacious indoor seating area as well as an moderate outdoor fenced in patio area.  We all got breakfast sandwiches which were inexpensive and enjoyable.  I dont remember what i paid for my egg, cheese and sausage bagel but it was reasonable.   Just as a note the sausage here is not a patty but rather hotdog like so it was cut up into chunks.
4	Ate here twice on my recent visit and it was the only place I did that with in 8 meals I had. The food is very tasty, the Crepes with Nutella were hot and delicious. The pricing is very good as a panini sandwich, soup and a tea cost me $8 and the Crepes with a tea was $6.50.  I will be looking for this restaurant again next time I'm in Montreal.
3	Went here for breakfast on my last morning in Montreal and it was ok.  The service was great.  The man at the counter was so excited for me to be in Canada and wanted to know all about my travels.  He also translated everything on the menu that I couldn't decipher.  I went with the salmon, cheese, and tomato crepe along with fresh orange juice. The crepe was a little bland, which may have been why the busboy asked if I wanted syrup for my crepe.  On a lox crepe? EWWW.  The orange juice was a bit misleading because I don't think it was freshly squeezed.. more like fresh out of the carton. It was worth the money although next time I think I'll just go for the sweet crepe.
5	I found this place a few years ago after a Snoop Dogg concert and I was never able to stop talking about their damn chicken salad...  Well tonight my partner and I left the comedy festival famished and I made it my mission to find this place!Well worth it! Light, healthy, & satisfying!
