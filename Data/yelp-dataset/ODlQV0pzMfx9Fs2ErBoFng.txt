4	Really enjoy living at The Pointe. Very skeptical at first since they were constantly switching management and heard that there was a shooting in the area a few years ago. After living here a few months however, I can see that those were past incidents and the new management has made great strides to ensure the safety of their residents. The Pointe is conveniently located with a bus stop within walking distance that takes you all around Champaign-Urbana as well as a personal shuttle that runs every hour. The apartments are very nice and updated. Maintenance is great at responding with all issues if any arise. Management and staff are easy to talk to and available when needed. They also host many community events that help residents get to know each other better. In addition, the rates are great and all inclusive. Overall, I would recommend The Pointe at U of I to all students, especially grad students as it is off-campus but accessible to get to campus when needed.
1	I liked the apartment and everything, but at the end when I wanted to move out they refused to give my deposit money back! which was 2 times the rent (~700)! They told me that they took over as a new company and as soon as I give evidence that I payed the deposit they gonna pay me back! I showed them the receipt and an image of the check and they still refused to pay me back and ignored all my phone calls!!!you can definitely find a better place with about the same price and they are more reliable!!
1	Personally, I would never recommend any of my friend live there. It was like a terrible mass! They are really over-rented and out of hand. Once you paid your rent, their mission is done.
5	I recently moved into the Pointe at U of I.  The move in went smooth.  There where a couple small maintenance items which where addressed quickly.  I am use to living on campus and its amazing the difference in response time at this property.
