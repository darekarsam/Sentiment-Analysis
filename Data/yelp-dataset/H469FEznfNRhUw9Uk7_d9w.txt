4	By far the best tasting Koobideh i've ever had. I'm not Persian but i'm obssesed with Persian food so i eat it a lot. Their soups and eggplant are badass too. They're a star short for the lack of alcohol. I know it's a religion thing but it takes away from the experience.
4	Tips:1- The eggplant appetizers are superb. Try them with the freshly baked bread.2- The Kabab selection is great and authentic.3- They put some pita bread, butter and onions on the table before they serve the food. You're not supposed to eat that onion with the pita bread! The butter is to mixed with rice, Pita bread is for the appetizers, and the onions to be eaten with the Kabab
1	Service was good but forth isn't worth the price point
4	My friend and I came here for lunch. Our meals came with tasty lentil soup and my friend had an entree that had rice with saffron and cranberries and chicken. She liked the chicken but wasn't too crazy about the rice. I got a dish that came with rice and Lima beans and lamb shank. The lamb was great and the rice was flavorful, but I wish it had more Lima bean. The waitress was kind but not very knowledgeable, perhaps because she was new. I will give them four stars though because they do know how to make good food.
4	This was my first time trying Persian food so I had no idea what to expect.  The service was really good especially considering we were a large group.  The food itself was also another high note of this place.  To start I had a lentil soup which was pretty good.  I also tried the gheymeh which is a veal shank stew.  It was loaded with lentils and seasoned with saffron and overall really good.   The meat was very tender.  As the other poster points out they don't serve alcohol here which is a bit of  a downer but I do understand that the owners do it for religious reasons.  Apart from that though this place is definitely worth checking out.
