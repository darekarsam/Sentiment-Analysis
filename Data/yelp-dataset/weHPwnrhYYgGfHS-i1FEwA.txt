4	Opening day yesterday and all was fantastic, which is actually unusual!We were a family of five so ordered a variety from the lovely (huge in size) menu - the adults ordered a meat and a cheese sharing platter and the children a chicken burger and chips. Arrived in good time and was delicious! In particular, the cheese platter was an excellent selection of cheese and good portion sizes. The service was extremely welcoming and friendly. Really looking forward to visiting again - there's a deli/cafe attached too so a coffee and cafe may be in order soon!
2	Lovely new venue food leaves a lot to be desired steak tough as old boots  staff  friendly  but not in control  all  over the place  harassed
5	One of my favorite places to go for a coffee, drink or meal.  They clearly put a lot of thought into buying locally when possible and serve some of the best coffee I've had in the UK. It's charming!
