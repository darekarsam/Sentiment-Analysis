2	Nice array of goods, not so great on customer service by the cashier, they make you bag your own goods... Whaaa?
1	De lo mas peor el servicio de una cajer q esta en articulos de 10 q feo respeto asi los clientes wooo 9:35pm 07/02/14 no la debeian tener ahi
1	Its really cluttered inside.  It seems like it is real unorganized and when asking where items are they seem to be clueless of where things are. Some products are opened so be careful when putting items in your basket or buying them. The bakery is nice they have a verity of goods.  Only issue is its a bit unorganized. My best friend ordered a cake and it just didnt taste too well.
4	I have a love hate relationship with this place. I love their low prices on produce on Wednesdays, can't get cheaper than that. Keep in mind though that Hispanics love their produce ripe so this is what you will get when you buy it. They also have a great variety of Mexican products that are not easy to find anywhere else. I hate how busy it gets, can't even walk down the isle without bumping into someone. I also hate the loud music that is always blasting. I mean come on, does it really need to be that loud? The meat department has a really lousy system. You have to take a number and wait for your number to come up. Let me just say that it gets crazy and the wait is long I have never spent more than $100.00 on a trip an this includes both produce and meat. This is a cart full though so I am getting tons of groceries for a really great price.
1	Nobody speaks English. Security doesn't let you enter with a Sports Bag. Cashers are slow and waiting lines are long. It's also not very Clean and the Air stinks there. But Mexicans will always buy from them, not me.
