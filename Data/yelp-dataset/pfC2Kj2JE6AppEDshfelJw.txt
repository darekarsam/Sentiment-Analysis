4	I didn't buy anything here but the store is awesome. There are tons of glass display cases with clothes, memorabilia, and Criss' personal belongings that are really cool. There is even a framed note from Sully Erna of Godsmack to Criss with the original lyrics to the Mindfreak theme song. Awesome.Also, I hear Criss hangs out here and talks to fans all the time.
3	After watching the show?  Uh no - I don't want a memento.  But to be fair, there were some cool t-shirts, key chains and typical souvenir goodies.  Like the other Cirque stores, everything is very overpriced.
4	Very friendly staff. Girl kept me laughing though she tried to sell me everything in the store (except Criss of course. Disappointing. Lol.) Will be returning when I go back to Vegas.
5	I LOVED this store! I found so many things that I wanted, and ended up getting a top! :) I can't wait to come back!
