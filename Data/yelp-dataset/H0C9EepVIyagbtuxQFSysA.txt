5	We used CC's Sweet Sensations for our wedding and grooms cake. WOW!5 stars all around! Very professional, and great customer service. We did a cake tasting in their bakery and all of the samples were delicious. We had a hard time picking which flavors to choose. We were so impressed with CC's that we hired them to do a chocolate fountain at our wedding as well.Their prices are unbeatable for the level of service you receive! I will recommend them to every bride I know!
5	Cheryl is AMAZING! People are still complimenting me on my wedding cake 2 years later! She sat with us at our cake tasting, listened to our ideas and then she designed a cake that exceeded all of our expectations. It was a work of art and so delicious! (It's the one at the top of her page on Yelp that is the white buttercream with the burgundy bow.) She has also made our groom cake, a charm cake for my bridesmaids, my son's first birthday cakes, and our anniversary cake. Cheryl is easy to work with, extremely talented, and her cakes taste FANTASTIC! We've ordered just about every flavor just to try them all. I would recommend Cheryl to anyone and everyone looking for an amazing bakery! I know that we will continue to use CC's Sweet Sensations!
5	So delighted with the job Cheryl and CC's Sweet Sensations did with a beautiful wedding cake for our friends. It was delicious, and the grooms said it was the best red velvet cake they ever had.  I highly recommend this bakery.
