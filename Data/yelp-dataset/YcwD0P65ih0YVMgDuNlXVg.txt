4	Earl and his staff know how to work on import cars with out price gouging.  They are efficient, fair, and knowlegeable.  I have gotten car service from him for almost 20 years and never been disappointed.
1	I have no clue how these guys have beein in business for 10 years.Have had my car there twice in the last 6 months on a recommendation from my regular mechanic. I was charged almost $400 between the 2 visits, for which they diagnosed nothing correctly; in fact what they told me they tested and WASN'T the problem, was EXACTLY the problem when I took it to a MERCB dealership. If i had gotten 400-one dollar bills and papered my wall with them i would have gotten better use out of them. My 3 yr old nephew could have taken his plastic doctors play kit and given me just as useful a diagnosis than these guys.MY ADVICE: if your MERCB is acting up, look these guys up online, write their address and phone # down, and make a note NEVER to call or visit here.
5	Dan is great with service and everyone at the shop has been attentive and efficient.  They are honest and clear on their estimates. I've used their services twice and am very satisfied.
