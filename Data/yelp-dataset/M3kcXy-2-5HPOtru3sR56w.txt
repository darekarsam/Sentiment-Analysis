5	The best and healthiest Soul food in Charlotte!There no pork, sugar nor MSG cooked into the food.  The price is very reasonable and servings are filling.  You will leave there very satisfied. The atmosphere is friendly and one could easily engage in a great conversation  with others.
5	Phenomenal hole in the wall. I'm a sucker for soul food and this place is legit. One of the first restaurants I visited after moving to Charlotte from Oregon and Grandma's delivers every time. BBQ Chicken is a favorite as are the wings (lot of flavor, not a lot of grease). Mac n cheese, collards, and yams are my standard sides but everything has been delicious with beautiful consistency
4	Grandma's has been in Charlotte since 1997 so they're definitely doing something right. This is soul food cooked with no pork but instead spices and herbs.....I mean pork is not even on the menu, so if you're looking for greens to be saturated in fat or some smothered pork chops, this is not your spot. That being said they do offer fried chicken and fish with an option to also have it baked, broiled, or grilled. The owner is very health conscious (my kind of dude), and advises you to taste your food before leaving because his seasonings cater to your health, and I personally appreciate that. After going back and forth over the extensive menu I finally asked the owner to recommend something which was bbq chicken, collards, mac n cheese, and potato salad(all entrees come with a meat, 3 sides, complimentary brown rice and a multigrain roll. Everything was very tasty, fresh and seasoned quite well. The bbq sauce has a kick as well as the seasonings on the collards, the mac n cheese alone will require a second visit......the only thing I wasn't feeling was the potato salad, it was something different about what was used as his base(maybe a nonfat mayo), but other than that, Grandma's is proof positive that soul food can be good without being saturated in fat.
