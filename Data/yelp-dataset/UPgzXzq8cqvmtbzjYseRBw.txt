5	These guys don't mess around. I spent a solid 2.5 hours in here getting educated about suits. I forget who helped me, Eric I think he was, but he did a great job of getting me to try on several suits that I might like.I lucked out and got 2 suits for the price of one. Sarar are high end suits that many department store brands rebrand as theirs. I love the new suits I bought and I really appreciate the help I received in picking them out.
4	If you're looking for slim European cuts of suits and dress shirts, this place is perfect.Look out for awesome sales. I took them up on their buy one suit get two free deal today.Their dress shirts are some of the most beautiful shirts I've come across at this mall. The ones under display are gorgeous with a lot of attention to detail.  Even though their shirts are slimmer, I highly suggest getting them to fit tailored to your body. The store's tailor recommendation had fairly competitive rates.
1	My boyfriend and I are looking for a nice tie and dress shirt. He was torn between the other ties from the other shop so we took our time to discuss and weigh things. Staff named carol was Very unprofessional. Very rude.She was complaining that she was tired and they have a long day and telling us if you don't buy the tie let me have it.No wonder they have no customers inside the shop. I will never never recommend this shop to anybody. Very bad customer service. And very sad because this is how they treat they're customers especially people from out of town.
