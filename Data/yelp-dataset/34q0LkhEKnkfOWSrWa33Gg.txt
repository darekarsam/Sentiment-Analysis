5	The professionals at C and A have helped me several times when I had an unusual request or a tight deadline. They are friendly and helpful and their work is terrific!
2	They did well to get our order done when we had a deadline, and the end product is quality and very affordable, but communication is seriously lacking.  I was given a different size shirt for a special request that was too small because the size I needed was out of stock rather than ask me what I wanted to do, and the other special request shirt was not done until 2 months later-thanks to lack of communication between employees and locations.  I was told I would be called or emailed when it was done, but nobody ever got back to me.  I had to go in several times to ask for it.  My experience was not stellar by any means and my rating would most likely go up with communication improvement.
2	Worse customer service I had ever experienced. They don't even say hi, how can I help you or anything like that. I ordered some uniforms and some huts for my employees  2 weeks ago. They told me they were going to be ready last friday, its tuesday already and they haven't even started with the embroidery part yet. IM VERY DISAPPOINTED!!
2	Terrible customer service, they told me my order would be ready on Friday and I never heard anything until the next Tuesday. Can't trust them.
5	I used C and A in 2009 for about forty shirts and logos. There were problems with my artwork, it didn't scale properly and Carlos waived the art fee to correct so we got a non pixelated, true color piece of work that matched my business cards. The last people left some nasty white backing on the embroidery, not these. It's been over five years and we still have most of these shirts still in service. I heartily recommend Carlos and his crew to you, you will be a raving fan as well.
