5	I received the BEST service here!  John is a honest mechanic and is very knowledgable.  I would recommend this place to EVERYONE!  Prices are reasonable and affordable.  I won't take my vehicles any place else!
5	John (the owner) is an honest business person, with fair and competitive pricing. My wife and I were referred to him by friends at work. He's been the only person over the past 5 years, that we've allowed to work on our vehicles (3 total). John has always been good at getting our family in and out, when we're on tight time schedules, and has saved us a lot of money (versus going to the dealerships). Despite him having a small shop in comparison to his large number of clients, I feel fortunate that John can take care of our needs as quickly as he does.
4	Everyone hates car repairs, this place makes it painless. Honest and quick, good communication too! Thanks! I am referring to friends and family. An Honest mechanic, wow it does exist after all....
5	I've known John for years and he runs his business with Integrity. I've sent my employees there and they have experienced the same great results.
