5	My kids' allergies were really kicking up, so I started looking for someone to clean our air ducts.  I called a highly rated air conditioning business to ask their opinion and they told me their customers were extremely happy with All Ducts.  I called Brian (owner/manager/employee) and he got me an appointment exactly when I needed it.  He gave me an estimate for both cost (very affordable, in my opinion) and time and both were spot on. He has all of the right equipment--he is not a carpet cleaner that is trying to moonlight as a duct cleaner. He is thorough and professional.  I had him clean my dryer vent as well, which was a tricky job, as the builder vented the dryer from the first floor to the roof. However, Brian had the proper equipment and was able to do the job easily. I highly recommend All Ducts.

He's very kind and we are super happy about his work. We did a remodel and there was so much dust everywhere. Plus, we had tenants in the property that left strong cooking odors. Not good since we were now moving into the  house. Now it smells great and we are dust free!  Highly recommend. Thanks Brian! :)
