4	A cute, odd restaurant with the atmosphere of a cozy coffee shop. Books line the walls & sometimes, they have bands playing. True, the service is slow, but it's always friendly, & the food is good & inexpensive! I've had nachos, sandwiches, a goat cheese salad, vegetarian burritos & they were all equally tasty, every time. Perfect for last-minute dinners & intimate conversations. Working the day away on your laptop is definitely an option as well.
