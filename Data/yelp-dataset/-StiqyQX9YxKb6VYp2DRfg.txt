3	This is the only place in town to go for major work on many foreign cars. Its either Rick's on Springfield or drive to B M'F'n Naperville.  Labor is $60/hour, but if I ran the only place in town certified to handle goofy obscure cars, I wouldn't be Wal-Marty about it either. Rick (I assume it was Rick) and his people are less than super coffee-shop friendly fuzzy and warm, but they are mechanics, not Red Lobster hostesses.So, the work is quality and they do not gouge you.  If you have the option of shopping around, or to have other places handle your 'lighter' maintenance issues (like brakes, oil changes, suspension work, etc.) you probably should look into it if you want to save some scrill. You could do much worse than Rick's.
1	My first (and last) experience with Rick's was an interesting experience.  I am new to Champaign and called to schedule my BMW for repair to what I believed was a caliper problem.  I was told to have my tires checked first at the place where I bought them.  I explained that wasn't possible since I had moved from out of state and again repeated what I thought the problem was (I knew it was not tire related). I was again told to have my tires checked, but they did not do that there.  If there was nothing wrong, I could call him back.  Incredulous!!! Not only was he not "super coffee-shop" friendly" as described by Tim J., but I got the impression he didn't want to be bothered!  I went somewhere else that promptly got my vehicle in ... and it was a stuck caliper!!!!  Since it was in for repairs, I also had them do some other maintenance work done - THEY  were great!  Rick's Automotive Service LOST OUT!!!
