5	Tanya is a wonderful healer.  When one modality did not relieve my pain as well as I had hoped, she got me in the next day to try something different.  She has even squeezed me in when she had no appointments available  when she knew I was in pain.  I highly recommend her to anyone who is interested in trying an alternative to traditional western medicine.
5	I am a golfer and I was having shoulder pain and my doctor gave me a prescription  totake to relieve the pain but it did not help. I saw Tanya and in 2 sessions the pain is gone and has not reoccurred. I also had problems with my ankle and she has taken care of that also. I highly recommend her.     Michael S.
5	Tanya got me out of bed and living my life again.  She has been treating my fibromyalgia and degenerative disc disease for the past four years and has kept me active and working when no one else could.  She is a knowledgable and compassionate healer and a truly nice person.
