4	The foot massage was great, but not a five star due to needing a bit more oil. They were super kind to get us in late in the evening and take care of me and my hubby for his birthday eve! We will be back in town in February and will probably have to go again!
5	Great place, great service. This was a spur of the moment to just go get a foot massage for my boyfriend and I. We enjoyed every minute. The staff was friendly and polite. We will be back soon.
4	Went here with my friend today.. It was both of our first experiences at any foot spa. It was awesome didn't realize you got a full body massage. The place was relaxing, clean and very friendly service. It's my new Spot for sure,,,
5	This place is always amazing. Polite great service. They always make me feel better and the prices are awesome
5	This place is an absolute diamond in the rough! Talk about getting your money's worth and THEN SOME! The staff is super friendly, the place is spotless, and all the linens were soft and clean. I recommend you wear shorts and a strapless top to get the most out of the full body massage...thought I was paying $30 for a foot rub, but Davy did my ENTIRE BODY and it was pure bliss! I tipped him $30 because it felt like a crime to get that type of service for only $30! I'll be here weekly from now on. Oh, and as if it's not already a great deal, they give you a punch card where you can get a FREE MASSAGE after 10 visits...amazing.
1	My husband and I went here for the first time today and won't be back. The place is very nice and clean and the employees are also great. But, massage therapists they are not. We've been getting reflexology for years and know what good and bad is. There was no pressure applied - worse than a Swedish massage. Felt no different when we left other than being aggravated that we waisted money and time there.  If you just like to be pet on, then it's a great place. If you're knotted up, forget it!
