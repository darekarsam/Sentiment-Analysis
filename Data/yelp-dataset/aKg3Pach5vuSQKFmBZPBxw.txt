4	This place use to be known as princess nails but now are known as carefree nails (new owner?). My sister and I are regulars here and love the chocolate pedicure! Highly recommend it - comes with a regular manicure.
5	Even on a busy 4th of July they got me in right away and gave me exactly what I asked for. I will definitely be back. My nail tech did a fantastic job with gel. By far the best design I ever had and not too much out of pocket!
5	I love this little place! Fast and easy! The only woman that has given me a gel polish that stays on for 3 weeks! And I'm in water all day everyday!! Go see Sandi! She is great!!!
