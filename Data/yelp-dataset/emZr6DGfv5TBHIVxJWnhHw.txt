5	I have been coming here after having ankle surgery. Doug Rich (the physical therapist) and his assistants are awesome and have been extremely helpful. Everyone here is very polite and professional. My advice, you need to get physical therapy here. I had been to other places before and my ankle has not felt this great in years. Doug is so good that after going to three specialists to find out why my ankle and knee were hurting and getting the same answers, that I didn't have any problems only a little swelling and that I needed physical therapy, the physical therapist is the one that told me I had a major ankle injury. He referred me to a specialist that he trusted and that doctor told me within minutes that I had torn ligaments and that I needed an MRI. He was dead on. Doug is that good! Get your therapy here!!!
5	Doug Rich and Team of Tim and Todd make PT an enjoyable experience while providing very effective therapy. Doug is very talented, gentle and experienced. He earns your level of trust and clearly communicates his procedures. I have not had pain relief like this and consistently after each session.This is a practice I am very comfortable recommending to anyone needing short or longer term PT. Thanks to the team for all they do to help their patients.
5	I've been going to Rich PT/Foothills Sports Med PT since July after I injured my ankle.  (Casted for a month..worst month EVER.)  Mike, the PT I see, is seriously awesome.  And the tech team of Todd and Nicki are great too!  I've been treated by Doug once too and he is a great PT as well.     I have never had more fun or laughed so much while doing PT.  In the future, if ever I need PT again, I know where I'm going.  :)
