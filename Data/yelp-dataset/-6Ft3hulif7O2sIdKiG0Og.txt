5	Very clean place to do laundry.  Staff is personable and always willing to help.
4	Not bad...older machines, but my clothes got clean, not like Rancho Dr. Laundromat, clothes felt gross and smelled nasty!  This place was good!
3	It wasn't bad but there was nothing impressive about it. Felt like any other laundromat to me. They have everything you need though, detergent, softner, coin machine. They only had one really large washer, which kind of sucked. And they have hand written signs ALL over the place, not a big deal, but you would think they could at least print these all out to make it a bit more professional. There was hardly anywhere to sit down. But the place was clean and I was able to to what I came for.
