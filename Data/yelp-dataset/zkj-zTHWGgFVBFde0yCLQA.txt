2	Only the fifth time I've visited this dog park. It's small with lots of shade trees, separate small and large dog areas, bench seating, dog watering fountains, plenty of entrances/exits, good parking and well-stocked poop bag dispensers. Dog owners  seem conscientious about picking up the poop. It is a little dark at night. My dogs and I have met several wonderful dogs during our visits. My biggest complaint is about the terrain. The ground is uneven and the roots from most of the trees are exposed and a tripping hazard for people and dogs. The City needs to add several inches of topsoil to level the ground and cover the tree roots.
3	Cute dog park with plenty of parking and segregated dog areas for small and large dogs.  There are some shady areas too for people to sit and relax in.  Mostly grass, but there are dirt spots too.Only bad part there are some strange homeless type characters that hang out there and can cause drama and the water fountains were NOT working so make sure to bring water for your dog.
5	This park has an area for dogs to play with each other. The park has three play grounds for children.
4	Lots of shade in playground area, great on the summer days.
1	This is the worst maintained dog park in the city and is an embarrassment to the parks dept. Waste bags are rarely available,leaves never removed,in general a place you want to avoid. Mostly dirt as grass is never replaced or reseeded. The baseball diamonds are maintained beautifully however. Maintenance employees should be terminated as they simply don't do their job. Your dog deserves better!!!
5	Numerous kid playgrounds, picnic areas, fitness system, great running trail and dog park!! Love this park. Clean and well kept.
