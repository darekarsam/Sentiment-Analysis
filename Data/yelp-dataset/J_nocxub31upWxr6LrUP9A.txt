5	I hate coming to this place, but the amazing staff makes it a little easier.
5	Nice facility. Had doctor JAcks. Friendly and informative. They took my blood onsite and I didn't even pass out! They do take you into an office to give you a book and go over financial paperwork. I was just there for some bloodwork on a routine issue so going over financial stuff seemed overboard. Lots of people here though are obviously there for radiation, Etc. I saw the treatment room and it looked comfortable with lounge chairs, books and blankets. Nice place. No complaints.
5	No one wants to hear those words, 'it's cancer'! But it happened to me and I found myself going through doctors appointments, meeting with surgeon's and radiologist and oncologist's. Which led me to CCCN.This place is were I ended up for treatment, twice a day for a total of ten visits. Each time, everyone from the staff at the front desk to those in the back offer a compassionate, caring and professional attitude. They make a stressful event seem less scary and show support and provide you with a sense of confidence that puts you at ease.I hope that no one has to go through what I haved had to, but at least if they do this place is very a good at what they do!
