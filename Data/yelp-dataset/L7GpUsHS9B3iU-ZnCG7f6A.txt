1	Seen one seen them all. Big chain food, all frozen and defrosted on site. Bad service. And an owner who walks around like he's king tut, waiting for his shift to be done so he can go back to Chomedey.
1	Great service and staff but not impressed with the food. Compared to the other locations the ribs don't taste like much and the fries were soggy. Three of us ordered the Lobster risotto... it was reminicent of Uncle Bens instant rice with watery sauce and practically no taste. My advise to the "chef", look up the definition of risotto on Wikipedia.
