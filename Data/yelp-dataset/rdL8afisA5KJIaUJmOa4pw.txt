3	Needs more fruit at breakfast but all in all a good stay. Helpful staff; business center severely needs update but staff was able to accommodate my needs. I'd stay again.
3	It was fine, rooms clean no vending machine or ice machine other than first floor...popcorn was a nice surprise.
4	I stay in a lot of hotels and this one is better than average.  I've already booked a room here for a follow-up trip to the Charlotte area.Staff are pleasant and helpfulBreakfast is above average and there was plenty each morning (an issue at some locations)My room was nice - clean, new (or new looking) and well-decoratedLocation was terrific (maybe a half-mile from the highway)Wi-fi as alwaysIf you'll be on the south side of Charlotte or going in the the Rock Hill area of SC, this is a good place to stay.As I mentioned, I'll be back.
3	I'm always staying in hotels for work and usually only stay at IHG properties. Below is a list of the pros and cons:Pros: clean rooms, friendly/courteous staff, parking lot security, wifi, popcorn machine, convenience store, weekly happy hour on Monday-Wednesdays consisting of food, wine, and beer. Cons: same breakfast every day (never changes), never any fruit at breakfast, always waiting for coffee to be made (they only leave 1-2 pots), gym is very tiny and lacking modern equipment.I will be back to stay at this location, but could use some improvements to better facilitate long term guests.
