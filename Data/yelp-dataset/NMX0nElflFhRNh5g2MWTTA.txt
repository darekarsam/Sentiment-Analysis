4	I am writing this review because Yelp really needs more reviews on the Service side.  I own a home in Central Phoenix so I need a good network for services.The Jolly Plumber is the best Plumber in town.  He is reasonable, honest and does an excellent job.  I have used him twice in the past year and would recommend him to anyone who needs a plumbing service.
5	Jolly Plumbing does a great job. The owner is very nice and rushed over when I said I needed help in a hurry. I would definitely recommend Jolly Plumbing!
5	Mike Jolly has been my plumber for several years. He keeps his appointments on time and does very good work. I have no desire to switch to a large impersonal company. Mike's mom answers the phone when you call and sets up his schedule and Mike does the work very profressionally.
