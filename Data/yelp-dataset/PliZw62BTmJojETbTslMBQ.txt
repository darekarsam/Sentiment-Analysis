5	I have been a client of MPG Import Auto Service (Mike and Patrick) for over 15 years. They are very professional, they are honest, fair and trust worthy and the kindest people that I would want to provide a service for me. They take very good care of any one that I send to them. I will not recommend anyone else to service my car, my family or my friends'. They provide excellent service as if I were a family member or friend!Roberta Johnson (Howard's wife)
5	What can I say about these guys and their business. They are fair, fun,, always helpful, reasonable and we  have always taken our  cars to them. Patrick helped my daughter find her first car. They have never over charged or looked for a way to jack up prices. Did I mention how fast they are? Thanks for all the years of wonderful service to our vehicles. We miss you!
