5	This was the most educational and fun activity on our trip to Arizona. Our guide, Caleb, was incredibly knowledgeable about all things climbing. We will use them every time we visit Arizona, or their other  locations, when traveling! We laughed, climbed and learned a lot! At one point I became a little overwhelmed with the height and Caleb safely, quickly verbally guided me down to where they were waiting at the bottom. An amazing, kind and very cost effective company!
5	I have always wanted to try rock climbing and finally had the opportunity w/ Stoneman. Had an absolutely great time with my instructor Todd. He had all the gear & was a great instructor. I would highly recommend contacting them if you're interested in getting out there. 5 stars all the way
5	My husband and I just got into rock climbing and were thrilled at the opportunity to try it for a second time in AZ! Caleb was an awesome guide and went beyond the two hour time we signed up for because he was willing to show us new types of climbs while explaining the technical skills and techniques as we went along. Now my husband is hooked on "crack" climbing! All of the gear was provided and we enjoyed spending the morning with Caleb. We'll definitely be coming back to climb with him the next time we are in the area.
5	My family and I were visiting AZ over the holidays and love to do group activities. I called up Caleb and he helped us set up a group trip for 9 of us. He and Hugo showed up with all the equipment we needed and were excellent teachers. Our group ranged in age and skill level and they adapted to our needs. Ontop of that, they were a lot of fun and our group had a great time with them! I would recommend them to anyone - very knowledgeable, affordable and you feel you are in good hands with them!
5	Our family had an amazing time with Caleb and Hugo! They were very helpful, instructive and patient with our large group. They made sure everyone had an awesome time!
