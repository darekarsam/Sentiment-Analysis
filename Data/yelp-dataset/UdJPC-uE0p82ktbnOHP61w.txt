2	Good lunch deals: $9-$13 for main course with coffee, dessert and soup.But food was less than average.Despite that the place was packed with locals.
3	This place doesn't look like much from the outside.Heck, it doesn't look like much from the inside either.But the food wasn't half bad!I ordered the Steak Hache, which came with:   Salad -- bland lettuce, nothing to write home about.   Bread roll -- prewarmed :)   Steak -- FANTASTIC.  Onions were grilled just right, the brown sauce was the right amount of unhealthy and umami, and the steak was cooked perfectly.  Also, their potatoes -- SO GOOOOOOOOOOOD.  I was so full, and that much meat (8 oz I think!) for just $8 at a sit-down restaurant ... heck yeah man.They also have weird 'Chinese' dishes, like smoked meat fried rice.  My dad always wanted me to marry a Jew lol.Apparently it's a Greek place, and kebobs are their specialties.  Take advantage of their dinner and weekend deals -- cheaper meals during special hours =]And the waitstaff speak English AND French!  I know it's Montreal, and this isn't anything special, but it's really refreshing.  My waitress also didn't switch to English even though my accent is pretty severe.  Extra points =]
2	Good Food,Rude staff.Specially When u Ask to Pay with US $
4	Great spot to pick up a French-style breakfast in Montreal. Prices are reasonable and the waitress was very nice! Full of locals and hospital employees from across the street. Will definitely be coming back on my next visit to Montreal!
