5	Jimmy Mac is the most laid back, fun wedding officiant. We LOVED him!! Thank you!
5	Jimmy's style, professionalism and humor was exactly what we were looking for. He was so great with our kids and guests.  I just wish we had more time to talk and get to know him better.  He was so well prepared and really made the ceremony go on without a hitch.  We also really appreciate him taking the time to meet with us in advance.  He really is the #1 Wedding Officiate in Las Vegas.
5	Rev. Jimmy Mac is one cool guy! There were plenty of heartfelt tears during the bridal procession, and he provided such a great balance by offering some appropriate humor to the ceremony. He is just a funny guy! He's got such a way of making you feel cool, calm, collected before the ceremony. I loved getting the pep talk before game time! He wrote a beautiful ceremony for us: heartfelt, genuine, God-honoring, and memorable. That is exactly how I would describe him as an officiant... Memorable. Our guests complimented us on our choice of officiant... Guests were engaged during the 30 minute ceremony. We had the perfect balance of a traditional yet hip ceremony. He also took the time to meet with us prior to the wedding to get some background on us and to find out what we wanted to have for the overall feel of the wedding ceremony. Thank you Jimmy Mac from the bottom of our hearts for being a part of such a special day for us.Candice and Aries
