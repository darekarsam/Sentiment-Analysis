5	My wife and I planned an April wedding just assuming it wouldn't rain in sunny AZ... well three days out we definitely needed a tent and just about everywhere in town was booked. We called Joe at JMS and they came through with a great tent at a fair price. I highly recommend them.
5	My baby shower went perfectly thanks to Joe! He was in contact throughout and worked with me to get the exact look I wanted, couldn't be more happier with the results. Setup/tear down was handled professionally. Highly recommend them.
5	Joe and his crew set up a tent for our Halloween party last year.  He really took the ball and ran with it so to speak with Orange and Black netting, very cool Lights, and Fog Machine!  It was the hit of the party! I'll be using him again this year for sure!
