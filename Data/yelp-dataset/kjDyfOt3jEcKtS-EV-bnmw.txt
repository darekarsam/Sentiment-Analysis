5	I love the Pont Champlain bridge. It is not the bridge exactly that what I love about it.It is the view and the feeling while driving over it towards the City of Montreal. The view is spectacular! I can see the big downtown skyscrapers, old Montreal, the Stadium Olympic, La Ronde, Mt Royal, and so many local sights. The view is so wonderful that I sometimes forget to look down to admire the tremendous and mighty St Lawrence River. I feel really excited to cross this bridge, as I know my journey from the USA is over and I can now relax and enjoy my favorite Canadian city.
2	I use this bridge when on a rtl bus going to the gf's place. During rush hours one lane in the opposite direction is closed off to allow buses to bypass the congestion. However this bridge is in terrible shape, bumps and pot holes everywhere. Also I would do the sign of the cross when using this bridge... Praying that it won't collapse!
