1	I would think twice, a little shady to say the least. My mom who is 91 is in a care center an confined to a wheel chair so I thought what a convenience to have a dentist come to them.  The first visit came off with out a hitch everything was fine, but upon the second visit just 4 months later suddenly they wanted to do 5K worth of work. Never did they explain that they were out of network which was a large part of the price but on top of that a lot of it didn't need to be done. it is very much taking advantage of the elderly an the situation, you are very vulnerable because you have an elderly patient confined to a wheelchair an its not easy to get them to a regular dentist an they try an make you believe it needs to be done right away.  Shame on them !!!  I do see a need for the service but they need more disclosures upfront an definitely seek additional opinion.  I will not be using them anymore.
5	Such a great concept!!! As soon as I found out about this company I had to work with them. They are always professional and give the best guidance. Finally a company that is giving a great service back to the community.
