3	I think their retail store is now closed... but they may still have a service center somewhere in town.  When the retail store was open at this location, I used to shop here from time to time for basic pool supplies like chlorine tabs.
5	Brian{Syvrud} was patient, available, creative, professional... truly a delight to work with! Greg Dunlap} did an excellent job communicating and managing the construction project beginning to end!
5	Wanted to take the time to say how great the service I received in the retail store today . I had my water tested by Wally and Chris between the two of them they were able to clear the pink algae in my pool. They were able to trouble shoot where the algae came from . Wally had asked me if I had been to  King, NC  lately and I had actually come back from there about a week ago I was amazed how they knew that, it is that kind of experience that keeps me coming back. Thank You Anthony & Sylvan Pools  you guys are the best!
