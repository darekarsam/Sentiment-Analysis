4	Fabric Boutique is the first quilt shop that I visited on my recent trip to Las Vegas. I arrived shortly after they opened, and the ladies working in the store were very helpful in finding everything that I need for a project I was inspired to make after seeing one of their panels. The shop had many kits, including several other panel kits. The shop also offers a frequent buyer's program, classes and a few Block of the Month kits.
5	I love this store. Great fabrics. Awesome Sales Lady. Just an all over great vibe. She was busy cutting fabric when I walked in but still said hello and said she'd be right with me. I will go back. And she even told me about wed. special. Thank-You
5	The ladies here were really nice. They ship stuff home for you. So, if you are on vacation here there is no excuse for not stopping. This place has more sample quilts than I've ever seen in a quilt shop. I got a lot of inspiration just looking at them.
1	I ordered a pattern 15 days ago and payment was made.  I call the phone # listed an no one answers.  I have forwarded the email sent to me that they got the order and payment, to follow up.  I also emailed to the address linked to my invoice and still no response.  I want the patter or, damn it send my money back.  I see wonderful revies but I can't do that with the issue at hand.I'm hoping this makes someone hop to it. I ordered the pattern by judydidit, gone to the dogs.
