5	I drive an hour just to go to this salon. Adam does my color perfect. Everyone in this salon is so friendly it feels like your visiting family every time you go. Just love it!!
5	LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! Must go to Rose...perfect color every time, I won't go to anyone else.Nice open, relaxing atmosphere, with a somewhat industrial yet modern feel.
5	I have been going to Rose Trogi for 14 years and she is one of the best in the business. She is professional and detailed. If you have short hair and need a good hairdresser for a great cut she is your gal. I have blonde highlights with black accent. I get compliments on my cut and color almost on a daily basis and it is because when you go to the best you look your best. How does the saying go "you get what you pay for". The salon has a nice atmosphere,  friendly staff and excell at what they do. Go see Rose and you will not be disappointed.
