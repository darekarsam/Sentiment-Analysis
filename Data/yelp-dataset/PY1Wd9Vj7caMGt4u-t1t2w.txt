5	It's an awesome experience, the way you're greeted when you come in , the vibe puts you in ecstatic mood . The staff is wonderful , they'll greet like they've known you for years. They'll help with your own custom order and inexpensive as well . The food is so simple yet so elegant . Every thing is so fresh nothing is ever frozen or reheated all food is made fresh. Karla is a great owner, So fun when she's around.The burgers are to die for !!!!The cowboy burger is one of the best burgers I have had in a while . The meat is so juicy and tender never a bad food experience when I'm there. Perfect ambiance to go relax and watch a game with you friends or on a first date ha ha.
3	Phenomenal rings.  Three more words: Super Bowl 2015. Fast becoming a neighborhood favorite, Karla's features big screens, good food, danceable tunes. As I sacrificed brain cells to Bacchus some years back, I sacrificed my hearing to industrial-strength engines and generators, large-caliber firearms, and the amplifiers of red-hot lead guitars.  I cannot hear in places with hard floors, ceilings and walls, therefore cannot converse with company at the table.  Therefore only three stars.
5	Outside of bar can be and was misleading. To my surprise the inside decor staff food & happy hour are awesome. Love to stop here for an after work cool down. Sit back with a couple of cold ones and let traffic die down. Must come!
