5	This is a newer office that opened up a few months ago near my work. I chose them because the location was convenient, they accept my insurance and I needed a new/better dentist. My last dentist of 13 years was not "in network", and I was tired of paying those hefty, out of pocket fees and going to his old smelly office.  I have been very pleased with my visits so far at Premier Dentistry. The office looks modern and comfortable.  It has a nice atmosphere/set up and both the doctor and the staff are very nice and accommodating. Prices are much better too.Another big plus for me is that they do sedation and they are open on Fridays. I couldn't ask more from my dentist :)Highly recommended.
5	I found Premier Dentistry through my dental insurance website. I thought I probably had a few cavities since it has been 3-4 years since my last visit to a dentist back in NY.  One of my teeth was very sensitive but I had to wait until my insurance kicked in January. Turned out I need a crown and a few fillings.Staff and doctor were friendly and did a fantastic job. Very happy with results.I've also sent two of my co-workers here so far and they both had good experiences. Hope this helps.
5	My wife and I just moved to the south Charlotte area and had to find a new dentist.  I chose to visit Premier Dentistry.  The office is very clean, organized, with ample parking.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Dr. Jalali showed that he is a knowledgeable dentist who took the time to do a thorough exam, explain his findings, and recommended tips to maintain good oral health.  My wife and I will be using Premier Dentistry as our dental office of choice in Charlotte.
