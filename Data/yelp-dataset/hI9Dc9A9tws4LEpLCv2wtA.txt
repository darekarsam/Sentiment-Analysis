5	Just to be clear, I am a little biased. However, this juice is amazing and will brighten your day. The only healthy option atFashion Square Mall. Open early to serve mall employees. Service with a smile!
5	I love this little cold pressed juice stand! The juices are pretty healthy and taste super awesome! I am glad this place is open in Scottsdale mall for me - closer than the one at the Biltmore. The "Strengthen" juice with protein and almond milk and cinnamon is amazing!
3	I thought their juice was okay.  they are super pricey compared to some of local competitors around Fashion Square. Almost $11 dollars for a single bottle of juice. I think I will stick with juice core or chop shop.
