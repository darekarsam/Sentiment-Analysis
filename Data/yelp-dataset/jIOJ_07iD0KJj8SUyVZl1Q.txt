4	How lucky can a girl be! This restaurant is literally next to my apartment.Before I ever ventured in here, my friend and I had always assumed its questionable location in a basement could mean two things; the place was absolutely horrible and hiding itself in shame, or it was a well kept secret with fantastic food. Thankfully for everyone concerned, it is the latter and I may be tempted to head down there in my pj's one of these days!The food is really delicious, and you'll find the staples of any reputable Italian restaurant here; pasta, pizza, as well as some really good seafood. What is quite special about this place though are the desserts. The owner's wife just happens to be polish, and I bet you don't find too many Italian restaurants with Polish puddings!
2	Very reasonably priced, but trapped in a bygone era, the Sicilian Restaurant is a proper curio. The food is fine, and it exudes a sort of hokey charm, but I think there are many better places to go for homestyle fare.Overall, we said: "as a trip to what restaurants used to be like, the Sicilian is quite an experience. But I don't think that's what they are consciously trying to achieve. Their version of authentic home-cooked Sicilian is far too constrained by the past, for my tastes. The place is interesting as a curiousity, but lacks the freshness and vitality to warrant a repeat visit."
