5	21 bucks for a car battery with a one year warranty!  Save your dollars and go here, you won't regret it.  The owner will swap out your dead battery.  This place is crucial if your car, bike, boat, or industrial machine needs a batteryotomy
1	DO NOT GO HERE! NOT A GOOD BIZ!!! I'm not sure if this is the safest place in charlotte or legal from a haz mat perspective.  It was a scary experience with people smoking, yelling & throwing batteries around.  The floor in the "office" was covered in oil and what looked like battery acid.  They Claimed I have a new battery even though it severely discharged the entire cell in just 6 months.  They didnt have any warranty on it.  This place is scamming people good money.  Stay away.  Far away.
5	Always happy to support this local business. I refuse to pay $160 for a new battery. I can get a new one here for $65 with an 18 month warrenty. I could also buy a used one for $35 with a 6 month warranty. They always take care of myself and my family.
