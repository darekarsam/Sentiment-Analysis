1	TERRIBLE massage, super sketchy place.. These women have no idea what a massage is.
1	This place is not a good one, if you are thinking to come. Change your route. I am very disappointed!You will pay for a terrible massage, hmm, it was the worst massage i took in my life!!It was my first time at a Massage, and the last one, if i consider this place!
1	for over 20 years I've been coming to Vegas and I've had so many massages over the years I can not count. Recently the massive influx of hundreds more massage places have driven DOWN the price & usually upped the quality of service. But alas, a dinosaur still exists! Rainbow asked for $70 for 1 hour? Whaaaaaat? Who does that? This is the New Las Vegas! $40 is the new norm AND it is on every corner! So the lady brought the price down to $50 pp p/h. And I finally got it here...the worst massage ever.! I came with my GF, but i didn't realize that this is JUST a BAD rub & tug joint. If that's what you want, cum here...if you want a real massage, check every other corner... And there are 30-50 (I swear. Within 1 mile if this rip off joint. Repetitive motions with no idea of what they are doing... Very very disappointing....Good luck out there....AVOID AT ALL COSTS-
