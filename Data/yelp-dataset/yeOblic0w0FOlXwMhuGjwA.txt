5	Great products and Katie has been the best!
5	Such a great store, and the employees that we dealt with were an absolute pleasure to deal with. They weren't too pushy, and were very helpful with answering questions.We needed to order an out-of-stock item and the process was very smooth. Not to mention, the item arrived within days of ordering. Way ahead of when we expected it to arrive!Just be careful...RH has so many awesome products that it'll be hard to leave empty-handed! Especially if the service is always as good as our experience!
1	I have no problem with the product of the actual store but the delivery service they use is delivering the piece of furniture I got 1 week and a half after I bought (even though it was in stock at the store) on a weekday with a 4 hour time frame. I paid $125 for shipping. What a rip off, I will never buy anything from restoration hardware again.
3	Great quality furniture and shower curtains but way to overpriced for example a shower curtain is $90 there and some of the employees including the manager gather in a group and just talk. I went there tonight and all I had to do was return a towel and buy a couple new ones and it took me 40 minutes to do that
