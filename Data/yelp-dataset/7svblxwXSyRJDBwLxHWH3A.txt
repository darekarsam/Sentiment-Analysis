1	Used to be a decent Barber Shop once upon a time. Remember Kenny used to work here, he was a great barber and a real cool guy. Toby could be rude some times.
5	Went in to get a Faux Hawk Fade and wasn't sure if I would like it but Doug hooked me up with a sik cut. I'm definitely coming back. This barber shop is the real deal. I've been to plenty of other shops but never got as good a cut as I do here. Come check them out.
5	I've been going to this barbershop for over 15yrs.  I've referred many of my family and friends to the shop.  Toby and Doug are more than barber's they're more like family. I love this shop and will continue to go there.
5	This place is awesome, my first time I came here, Doug did my hair. You won't get board at all with Doug. He is really social and great guy. This place is my place from now own. I will be returning soon. Thank you Doug and all the guys there.
5	Ive been coming to tobey for over 10 years great cuts and funny conversations. Only down fall is the wait but well worth it plus u can check in and come back later. Or come early during the week and skip the wait.
5	Love this shop always a great atmosphere. Doug and Toby are awesome. Been coming to this shop since I was 9.
