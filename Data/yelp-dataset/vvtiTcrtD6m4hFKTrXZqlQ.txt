5	Juliet is very passionate about her work and a desire to help.  She is a great Pilates instructor and is recognized threw her Pilates education.  She took the time to find out about me by asking about injuries, illness or medications that might affect the workout so that instruction could be tailored.She is very observant and notices if there are body imbalances and realizes that each day brings a different set of circumstances.  She is the consummate professional who always keeps a good attitude, makes learning fun and is encouraging.I never realized the mental aspect that went along with this work out which was very enlightening to me.  I highly recommend Juliet Lauren Pilates whether it is your first time or not.
