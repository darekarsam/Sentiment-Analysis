4	I come here with my kids all the time. They love it, it's better quality than St-Hubert chicken, and it's simple. I would like to see smaller portions for the kids.
3	A solid bet when in the area, also (without doubt) the cheapest bite in Outremont, they have some good specials that are well priced and a nice selection of chicken dishes.In my opinion, the chicken is more consistently good than at St-Hubert, the sauce is a bit too mushy with no BBQ bite, the fries are just ok. But at 6 or 7 bucks, it's well worth it.The location is a semi basement, a bit small but there is a tiny terrace for summer.They offer delivery and take out is a good option,the many parks nearby being a great place to enjoy the food.
