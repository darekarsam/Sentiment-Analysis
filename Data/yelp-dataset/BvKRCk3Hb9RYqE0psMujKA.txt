4	Good experiences here so far
5	It's nice to not " require" appointments however, if you don't have one and it's a busy day it can be a bit if a wait. The location is convenient so you can do other shopping or go home and back. You could also call in and check in and they will let you know when to come back. Good prices and Steve Harrington is the BEST!!
2	The prices are great, but the wait is miserable. Don't think I've ever been here and not waited over 45 minutes. How about some more employees?
2	Okay, so I walked in last Sunday looking for a haircut. They said the wait would be about 20 minutes, so I said to myself ok, let's go look at ross and see if they have anything while I wait. I go back to Sams about 15 minute later and the girl at the table gave me attitude when I came in. She said what's your name! I said Jake and she goes "ok I've been waiting lets go." I decided ok I will go because this is the only place around town open this late. I hated the attitude but the haircut was nice. I would prefer Great Clips or a regular barber shop.
