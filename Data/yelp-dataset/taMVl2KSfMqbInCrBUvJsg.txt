1	Honestly I REALLY don't like this location. I've never had a positive experience here. I eat at other locations at least a couple of times in the week and I won't go to this one anymore. The portions are skimpy compared to other locations. They are not friendly in the least. And make me feel like I'm being a burden (since I'm ordering a large order to go.) I'm more than happy to let others go in front, but even when I'm the only one in there I feel like I'm bothering them. The locations on 75th and bell and 59th and the 101 are my go to locations. Always so friendly and welcoming!
