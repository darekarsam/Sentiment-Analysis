4	This company is an Authorized Agent of US Cellular.  I stopped in today looking for a new phone for my wife.  I spoke with Dan and Alex (I think that was his name) - both were very knowledgeable.  They recommended adding a text message package that will save us almost $10/month in overage charges.  I also talked to them about getting my wife a Blackberry.  They had a couple models to choose from.  However, I'm not sure my wife is ready to make the big step to a "smart phone".
5	I've purchased several Blackberries for my business through Quality Cellular.  They are always very friendly with prompt service.  I'd definitely recommend Quality Cellular to anyone who's tired of trying to get service from an 800 number or mall kiosk for their phone.
5	We visited this store the day after Christmas 2014 to do a pretty complicated transaction, adding two new iPhones to my parent's account, which was just basic phones with no data, so we would all be on one shared plan.  The employee walked us through all our options, helped us calculate the plan that was cheapest for us for what we wanted, and although the US Cellular back-office system remains a mess (it took over an hour to get the logistics of the new lines completed), the staffer was very conscious of our time and even told us to go get lunch while he worked everything out.  Much, much better than the US Cell stores we've visited elsewhere in Madison.
