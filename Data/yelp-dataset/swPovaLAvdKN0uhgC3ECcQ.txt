3	This Starbucks is inside Von's. It has limited pastries and often takes a long time to get your order completed as there are only a few workers at a time. They also run out of product quickly and I believe they close at 5. Plus no drive threw.
5	LOVE this Starbucks! Joey and TJ are the best baristas! Joey has my drink ready for me before I even place my order!
1	This place is horrible! The Hispanic lady in the morning give the entire store (employees) coffee before she even helps customers. Today I was in line forever and finally walked out.
