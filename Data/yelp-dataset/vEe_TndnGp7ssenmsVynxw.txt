4	This place is located in Sola Salon building.Small but the service was great.
5	Found this awesome salon via groupon and it's a great place. The pedicure is one of the most thorough, luxurious, pampering ones I've ever had. Call to check on walk in availability, but make an appointment for a guarantee. Nicole, the proprietor, is friendly, kind, and fun!
1	I went to this place the other day and the experience was awful !!  The lady has a nice personality and unfortunately that is the only positive thing I can mention about it.  Nails were done awfully, and their  edges were still pointy and sharp! She reused the wet dirty towel few times during the process and was a little careless! If you love yourself DO NOT GO THERE! I usually have a nice personality and higher tolerance but this was out of my league!!!  NO NO and NO!!
