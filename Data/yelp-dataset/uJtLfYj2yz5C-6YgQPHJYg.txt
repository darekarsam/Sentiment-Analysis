4	I love their sandwiches....good choice for a good, inexpensive lunch....friendly customer service
2	A bad day along Saint-Laurent!I stepped into the joint only to be harassed by a man panhandling for money... INSIDE the store. What the??? Why would a business owner allow this?After brushing him aside, I looked at the wall of dried sausages hoping to spot my prize. I wanted to bring home a nice selection on the plane home to Vancouver.Wait!What the??? again. Staring back at me was a nice coating of blue mold around one of the ends of the sausages.Au Revoir!
5	Top-notch Hungarian sausages, smoked or otherwise, are the specialty here. Recommended: Debreceni, Frankfurters, Hungarian bacon, and their spicy Hungarian sausage sandwich (especially if you get it with sauerkraut and spicy mustard) served hot on a Portuguese bun.A throwback to a time when this stretch of St-Laurent was a bustling Hungarian enclave (among other things).
4	A great place to buy inexpensive paprika, they make it themselves and have regular and an amazing smoke one.  Other than that they make a variety of very yummy sandwiches that are dirt cheap, filling and crave worthy.  The location is easy to get to and the staff is not only really nice but they offer great recipes if you take the time chat
5	I travel 45 minutes every time just to get my hands on their dried spicy sausages (the ones that hang behind the counter).Sometimes they don't have them pre-dried and I have to wait for 2 whole weeks while they lay there looking delicious in my fridge (torture!)....5 stars, because those sausages are worth it.
