1	Wow smells like feet& UNSANITARY  !  I came in for a full set  & I wanted short nails & I got long ones . I told them several times to cut them down & they wouldn't . I was charged an extra 5 bucks for the long nails. My nails ended up being messy & when I asked to get them fixed , they gave me attitude & they cracked the edge of one . I was surprise of the service I got here concerning that it had good reviews & good ratings . Will never again come here.
1	Smells awful & my last review was deleted!!! They have bad service here! Went in for a full set . The work was messy!  Never again I'll stop by here !
4	Kim took care of me. I had powder acrylic on and the last tech messed them up. She put liquid gels on for me. My hands feel clean and pretty. Thank you.
