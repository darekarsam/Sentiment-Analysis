3	Any Express SAQ within a five minute walk from my house is a good thing. The selection is quite limited as most Expresses are. And there's always a guy sitting outside with the dog asking you for money. But again... 10am-10pm. Who's complaining;))
5	I'm always a fan of the SAQ. I mean what is there to compalin about? They have alcohol. It's not a big SAQ so they don't carry everything but I'm not fussy!!!
