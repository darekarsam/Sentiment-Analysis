3	Specialising in all things racket sports, Bruntsfield sports stocks a decent array of top quality tennis, badminton, squash and table tennis gear. The Meadow's tennis courts, and the recent spurts of sunshine may persuade you to have a peek inside here.  But please, don't be tempted by the latest carbon graphite alloy racket if you just want to smash a tennis ball around for half an hour a month: you'll end up paying a hefty price for some of the gear in here unless your modest about your abaility and frugal with your cash.
3	I came here with my friend so she could purchase a tennis racket for the warmer Wimbledon obsessed months of the year. Bruntsfield Sports claims to be a tennis specialist and indeed it's not lying. A good racket does come with a price though, and I'm not sure if you are better off pursuing other on line retailers. However, the staff are very knowledgeable and I strongly believe you should have a hands-on feel of tennis equipment. The store is quite large and other than tennis also stocks squash, rugby and other sport equipment, clothing and shoes.
4	If you are looking to buy a decent tennis racket, and I'm sure hockey stick as well (though that is not an area I know much about), then this is the place to come.  The staff really do know what they are talking about and the range and quality on offer is superb.You are going to have to expect higher prices than elsewhere when you shop here because you are buying something that is top quality, not some cheap tat from Sports Direct.  The good news is that you do get what you pay for and higher prices do imply higher quality.  The only thing I would say is that Bruntsfield Sports is a tad misleading as a name and unless you want hockey or tennis equipment, do go elsewhere.
