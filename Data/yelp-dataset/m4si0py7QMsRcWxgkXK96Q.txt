We had not yet had a dentist for her and she had an accident at preschool and I called them in a panic from a referral from a neighbor. I was so nervous that I was not going to find anyone to take a new patient let alone an emergency. They sheduled an appointment for her within the hour and we were on our way! I was so impressed by the staff and the overall experience. This was her first trip to the dentist ever and they worked so well with her. She left asking when we would be back! :) Needless to say, Dr. Biehl will now be the dentist for our whole family.
