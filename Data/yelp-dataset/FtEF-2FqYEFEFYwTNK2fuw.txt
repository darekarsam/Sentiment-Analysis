1	I purchased 2 display cases for my business and it didnt even match the one they put out for display. When I went back to complain, one of the female employees inform us that their sample is 2 years old so it's not going to be exactly the same. She's not even apologetic and tells me I can always return it. My partners and manager assembled it so why would I waste so much time having them un-assemble it and look for another display case when I need to open up our shop.  She was rude and I never ever would bring them any business again. What happened to customer service? The least she could've done was just apologize
1	I just bought a couple display cases and the ones I bought weren't even the same ones on the display. I made 3 trips back and forth to ask questions and swap some out. Customer service was not as good because the lady working said we can refund them if I wanted to but would be a charge since I already assembled them. This place might be cheaper than other places but make sure you ask them every detail about the product before purchasing.
5	I ordered $2,500 worth of Chrome shelving for my garage! It was a big leap of faith since I'd never heard of them before. I liked that they have been in the business for over 50 years and that they proclaimed to be proud of their friendly customer service. When my order came without castors, they jumped right on my problem and replaced the lost ones at no charge to me. It was a pleasure talking to their customer service people, who are on-site employees of the company and answer their phone right away. They showed concern for my problem and solved it because they live up to their commitment to customer service. btw, the shelves were top quality.
