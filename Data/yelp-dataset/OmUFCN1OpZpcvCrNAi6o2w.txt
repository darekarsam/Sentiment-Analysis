5	I learned about these guys from their neighbors at Professional Brake Service. They are as good and honest as Pro brakes. Had a few electrical issues with my car, they got me up and running. Next day, wouldn't start again, they came and got it, took it to the shop and diagnosed the issue,  and credited me for the labor. I've already recommended one colleague, who took his car there and found it too be much less expensive than the franchise place he took it too for an estimate first.
5	The truth is I was heading to Professional Brake, which has 5 stars with 111 reviews on Yelp!. Unfortunately, they went on vacation. There was a sign on their door, pointing to ATS Auto and Truck Service, so I thought I might as well gave them a try. First impression was they were nice. They took a look at my brakes and told me my brake still good for another 50K miles. Not bad! :)Although they haven't performed any service for me yet, I like their service, attitude and will definitely come back.
5	I own 2 diesel trucks and several cars. My 6.0 Ford diesel was having issues and the dealer almost gave me a heart attack with the cost to repair it. ATS was able to do it for 1/3 the price and it only took a few days where the dealer usually takes a week or more and they fixed a few more things they found while they had it torn apart without raising the price.Family run business, great mechanics and VERY reasonable. I only wish there was an option for more than 5 stars
