1	Don't eat here!!!!! They have horrible service, the food is nasty, and they take forever to make one hamburger.

1	Love Burger King, hate this store, they are rude, never get the orders right, more interested in playing with their co workers than taking care of the customer, the food is always stale and way past it's expiration, worst worst worst location ever !!!  I would rather starve than eat here !!!!
