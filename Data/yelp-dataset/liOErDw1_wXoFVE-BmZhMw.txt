5	This is one of my favourite little restaurants in Montreal. It's tiny, intimate, and has a great menu! The staff is amazing.  It may be run by a family, but I'm not all together sure. Whether or not they are a family, they seem to treat their patrons like family. My grandparents used to eat here a lot a few years ago, but my grandfather does not like driving into the city. Last year I called for a reservation and they asked if it was for my grandparents. Even after a couple of years not going, they still remembered them. They are always pleasant, ready with great suggestions for both meal choices and wine pairing. They have delicious options on their menu and a reasonably priced and varied table d'hote. I would recommend this restaurant for a romantic intimate date or a very small group (2-5 max). It's a really tiny place so you might also want to make a reservation, especially if you're more than two people.
