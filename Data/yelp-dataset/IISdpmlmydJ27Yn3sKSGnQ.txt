4	I used to build and repair computers back in the day, and this was my go to place. Compared with other retail stores, they always had the lowest prices. Ideal when shopping for parts to upgrade your machine. They have a large selection of hard drives, ram, video cards, and motherboards. Be sure to check out their website. It's updated regularly, and they don't keep their entire inventory out on the floor. I've found it's best to do your research online (ahead of time), even call them before dropping in to make sure they have what your looking for in stock. You can also buy pre-built machines, have them customize a machine for you, and special order parts if they've sold out. They even offer an additional discount if you pay cash (in-store). Recommended for all moderate to full-blown computer geeks.http://www.microbytes.com
1	There are cheaper price just have to shop around. there service is very poor, I purchased there extended guarantee and they come up with all kind of reasons why not to respect it. such as the CPU cooler I purchased as part of the computer parts to build my own rig. it starting to give error messages in the BIOS that it fails. the store say that the cooling system is not covered. I purchased a more expensive CPU cooler less then a year ago. they ignore my email as well.NOT RECOMMENDED
