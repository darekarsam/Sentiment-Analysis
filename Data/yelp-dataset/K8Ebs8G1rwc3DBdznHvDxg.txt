1	One of the worst Wendy's I've ever experienced.  Every morning there was a 30-minute wait - after ordering - for food.
5	Best Wendy's experience I've ever had! And I wouldn't normally take the time to review fast food. We went just after midnight following a long and tiring day of moving. The idea was to hit up the Eat'N'Park over by Giant Eagle, but alas, they were closed.We pulled into the drive thru, and were immediately greeted. Needed a minute to figure out the order and they waited patiently. Also made sure we were okay with waiting 6 minutes for the 3 chicken sandwiches we ordered, which we were. We pulled up and there were 3 young men working the window. They were moving quickly, smiling, and paying attention to what they were doing. We got our drinks and paid, and then I asked if I should move up since we were waiting and there were other cars behind us.We waited about 3 minutes when one of the guys comes out and literally FLOURISHES our 3 bags of food at us. I mean, presentation AND style? At a fast food drive-thru at midnight? So cool. He was funny, attentive, and totally made our night. I don't even LIKE Wendy's that much, but I will definitely be back, and soon.
3	I don't remember the last time I stepped into a fast food burger joint.  Every time I come here, whether it be midday, evening, or late night there is ALWAYS a wait in the drive thru.  Go at the right time and the person doing the drive thru intercom could be the best entertainment you get in a while.  Oh, yeah, the food isn't all that bad either, props for the "fresh cut fries."
2	Please clean your floor properly.  It feels like Crisco under your feet.  Very dangerous.
