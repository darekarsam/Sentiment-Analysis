5	It took us years to find this hidden jewel but now it's always a pleasure to eat at Amato's. Great service and delicious food.They have a nice terrasse in the back that will make for an unforgettable evening. The Cesar salad, with dressing made fresh at your table, is a must.Pastas, risottos... they are ALL delicious choices.You HAVE to try it!!!!
5	Service was amazing but I do recommend reservations as we were almost turned away at the door on a rainy Saturday night. Ordered the table side caesar salad, carpaccio and pasta. Finished with a fruit dessert. Everything was delicious. We shall return for sure!
