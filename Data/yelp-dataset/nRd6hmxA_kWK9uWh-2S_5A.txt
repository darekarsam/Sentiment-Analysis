5	If you are an ice cream aficionado you will absolutely love Doc's! The gourmet frozen fruit bar flavors will satisfy any gourmet dessert desire. How about Mango Habanero? or Coconut Lemongrass Lime? or Blueberry Pomegranate? or my new favorite, Blood Orange?  There are so many melt-on-your-soul flavors to choose from the only problem you will have is deciding . . . . deciding which one is next!Doc's ice creams are made with locally produced and sourced ingredients . . . . with no dyes, no colorings, no GMO's, and are all handcrafted frozen gelatos, sorbets, sherberts, custards and artisan ice creams. A LOCAL TREASURE . . . . right here in our little neck of the planet!
4	I really enjoyed their popsicles at Devoured last weekend. I am looking forward to coming in for a visit.
5	It is rare that I ever get excited about a dessert item, but this place has earned the excitement. I recently discovered Doc's and every trip I get to try a different amazing flavor that this place offers. It cannot be understated that Doc's starts with high quality ingredients to create a sorbet or gelato that tastes like the best possible version of what it describes. The blackberry cabernet sorbet is miraculous and tastes like the perfect marriage of the flavors and not just frozen sugar on a stick.
5	My husband and I decided to stop by because of the Yelp reviews. The reviews were spot on. They have many awesome flavors for sorbets and gelatos like mango/habanero, strawberry/champagne and sea salt caramel.  (We are on our way to trying them all) It's a super feel good place ran by great people. It is now on our favorites list.
5	Got to meet Doc the owner when he stayed open later so my pregnant wife could fulfill her dessert craving. The popsicles were amazing and he even let us sample some fresh gelato he just made. This place is a hidden gem that I'm glad we have found. It's also great to support a local small business.
