4	A nice selection of stores right next to the Farmer's Market, includes a nice Levi's store and a Lego outlet, just to name a few. Good place to go to enjoy some air conditioning and escape the crowds after visiting the market across the road.
2	I usually love shopping at outlet malls. But St Jacobs Factory Outlet Mall is just so depressing.There were hardly any bargains. And the stores and the merchandise were both so outdated. Not worth coming here for a special shopping trip but if you are in the area and have nothing better to do and outside is freezing cold.. then maybe.
3	Its not what you would expect from a outlet mall but it does provide a good break from the heat if you been up and running around in the summer at the St. Jacob Market.The outlet mall itself is very clean and located in a old Barn looking like building. There are not much high brand stores...well there aren't much stores at all. The washrooms are clean and you can get cold water from the water fountain. There is not much choice on the food either but the small Lego toy building zone is fun and they have bunch of good stuff built as well.
