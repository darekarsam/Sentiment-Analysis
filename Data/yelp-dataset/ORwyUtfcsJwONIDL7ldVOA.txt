5	This Walgreens smells NEW!  The store was so clean.  The employees were ALL so nice.  They seems to be everywhere around the corner to assist.  Love the layout.  It is new, nice, clean and kind of upgraded from the older Walgreens in town.
5	#1 Walgreens in the neighborhood!!!!! CLEAN place with amazing staffs..
2	Just seems the lines here take a really long time. It's not a grocery store its not Wal-Mart... why only one person working cash register?
1	Stop irritating customers! You asked once if you can help don't ask 20 more times!!!!
