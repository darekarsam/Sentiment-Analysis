1	Horrible service! The lady on the phone is atrociously disagreeable. She was trying to force me to get two Pizzas when I just wanted one, then I kept telling her I wanted one medium pepperoni and she was trying to make me get a large vegetarian. I flipped and told her I didn't want anything and I hung up, she then called me two times and left me two messages. Very unprofessional, the entire thing just felt creepy, don't ever bother getting anything there. I'm surprise that place is still open.
3	First of all, I agree with Gabriel.The woman on the phone is C U Next Tuesday all the way and I never understood how she could stay there so long. Here's my deal with this restaurant - I've never eaten there, I've only ever ordered out, hence my lack of affinity for the rude old lady.What keeps me coming back? Italian Poutine. They don't use cheese curds, just shredded cheddar, but they broil it and it's just incredible, especially with the somewhat sweet spaghetti sauce they use.So it's a toss-up. If you can deal with a human leather bag who sounds like she huffs on 2 packs of smokes a day and constantly tries to upsell your order, prepare to eat one of the best Italian poutines of your life.
