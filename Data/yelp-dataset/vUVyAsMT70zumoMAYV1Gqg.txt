5	Finally, amazing, highly skilled trainers that take an interest in you.   They do an assessment that designs a body blueprint - a program built just for you to help you get stronger, faster!  They also offer small and large group trainings from yoga and barre to boxing and bootcamp.  They even have a great spin studio.  New equipment that I've never seen before, in a beautiful facility.  I've met all the trainers - they really made me feel comfortable. You've got to see it for yourself!
5	This is the best gym I have ever been a part of. Terry and the crew really focus on everyone individually, and are always so welcoming and positive. I have become addicting to spin classes, and alway leave feeling great. You won't regret joining the Elements of Fitness Family.
5	Terry and her crew are the best, i loove how they make you feel like family every one is so welcome and super energetic, I'm on week two and i can already feel the difference, they know how you body works and adjust the work out for you! Best place hands down!
5	I've never met such a knowledgable and friendly management staff. Results are better than anything I have ever experienced. Everything is tailored to your your body type, goals, age, etc.
