5	I love these guys!!  By far the best in the valley.   A family run business that makes you feel like family.  Have been using them for 2 years now and have not found ANY spiders, roaches, etc. in my house since.
5	I was visiting Vegas this past weekend, and noticed the condo I was staying at had some live activity let's just say.  I quickly jumped online and found D-Termination Pest Control.  The lady who answered the phone was very nice and informative.  She knew exactly what to look for and was so helpful.  She assured me she would have some one out there asap, and sure enough, a technician arrived.  They found the live activity, and I was able to enjoy the rest of my Las Vegas trip with no fears or worries.  Great company, great customer service, great work.
1	D-Termination Pest Control sent me three invoices over a year old - two of them were $60 each for two bed upstairs condos - I disputed the charge as it is high.  D-Termination would not adjust as they said they sprayed the outside too.  The outside of a building with four units??  I didn't order that but I have to pay for it??  I do not recommend nor will I ever use them in the future.  Hope that $40-$60 that you overcharged me is worth the future business of a property manager.
