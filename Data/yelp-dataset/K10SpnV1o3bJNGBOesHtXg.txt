2	Chopstix has a full menu of chinese and japanese goodies, including sushi.  They also have really low prices.  Alas, maybe it was too good to be true.  While my sweet and sour chicken was standard, the sushi I ordered was quite awful.  It was not fresh by a long shot.  It was a good deal, but the sushi was a major let down.
1	American Chinese food is greasy and terrible everywhere, and that's what we know and love about it. However, Chopstix has accomplished the amazing feat of actually making greasy, fried food taste bland.One day, I came home craving Chinese and serendipitously found one of their menus stuffed in my mailbox, along with some absurdly good coupons. I placed a huge order and paid almost nothing for it. I guess I got what I paid for, because the food was barely edible. The Cold Sesame Noodles were just plain noodles--no sauce, and I don't think the Fried Rice was actually fried, but it was inexplicably neon yellow in color. I couldn't even find the chicken in my General Tso's--it was mostly breading and a sweet and sour sauce.I learned my lesson. Trust me, don't get sucked in by their prices--just say NO to Chopstix!
1	Do not order if you are hungry or in a hurry..we ordered at 8:20 on a Sunday evening and were told around 40 minutes...65 minutes later we called and were told they were slammed. Hard to believe on a Sunday evening. They then told us another 30-45 minutes. We cancelled as who wants to eat chinese at 10:15-10:30. Most disappointing as we asked them to call if it was going to be more than 50 minutes originally....needless to say we will never use them again.
