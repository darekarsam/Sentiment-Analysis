3	This about the only place in town that you can go in, pick up a bag of stuff and come out for under $20 bucks, that's if you try hard enough, you might break a $20.I like walking up and down the isles, just checking out everything.  Sometimes I am surprised, we use a certain medication ointment at work and sell the same brand and the same size for $14, it's only $.99 here!  That's a bargain.  I also like coming here to pick up snacks, especially for the many road trips my husband and I make.  It's the same snacks we could get at any gas station or convenience store, but here, it's all $.99.  Now that's a bargain. Do not be fulled by the look alikes, the body lotion, or hair shampoo that looks like the name brand, the packaging might look like the real thing, but sometimes, the quality isn't, so unless you've tried the off brand, be weary.
4	What can I say.  Who can beat .99 per item?  Staff is nice but always seem over whelmed.  I get great things for my Girl Scout troop & for parties.
