4	You know about their food truck? No? You're missing out and so was I. Let's just say that their Lomito Complete sandwich was orgasmic enough for me to scarf down the entire sandwich. Accompanied with a mint lemonade and Mexican corn, well, that was delicious. I'm waiting for the line to be out the door on this small shop.
4	I walked in today right when they opened. I was famished. I had not eaten breakfast so I went for the vegetariano. The egg was cooked perfectly over medium and the combination of chimichurri and roasted peppers were bursting with flavor. Glad I happened upon this Bloomfield gem!
4	this place is great. i got the manchito and because of the runny egg i had to use a knife and fork to eat it but it was REALLY good. i'll most definitely be returning. i'm so full and sleepy now but in a good way. it's BYOB, too! maybe slightly expensive for sandwiches in baskets but the food is obviously great quality (meat, etc.) so i wasn't mad about it. you get what you pay for here!
5	The Lomito Completo was magnificent Messy goodness with every bite.  One of the best sandwiches I've had
