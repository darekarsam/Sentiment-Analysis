5	If you are going to trust your mind, brain, inner-most thoughts, inner child and future outcome to anyone, Serena is your gal.  In my personal experience, she is trust-worthy and ethical, truly cares about you and is great at what she does.  Looking forward to my next session.  Thanks Serena!
5	I've gone to Serena a few times and her NLP techniques are amazing.  She provides a calm and relaxed atmosphere, provides excellent coaching and the techniques work.  I know that when I have an issue I need to deal with, I can go to her and she will help me through it. I've never had an issue resurface after seeing her.
5	I attended one of Serena's sessions and was  really impressed with the results. She is extremely talented and a skillful coach. With Serena's guidance I gained amazing insight about my inner-self. She really is awesome and I highly recommend her. Thanks Serena!
5	What an experience!!! When I left life seemed to be much more up lifted!! I'm soo surprised on how well my session went and my seemingly end of the world feelings seemed to take a back seat  to reality... for this I thank you and I'm very grateful to have a session...
