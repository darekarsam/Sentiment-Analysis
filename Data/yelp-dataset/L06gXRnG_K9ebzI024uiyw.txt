4	A Second Hand Shop - Cool!  The owner is very pleasant and helpful - Want some Castle keys (see my Photos).  Antique Furniture and more!
5	Really cool, hard to find items at great prices - hard to find real wood furniture these days and always has a great selection of home accessories too! Owner is very helpful, and can help find most any type of piece you are looking for.  Definitely worth stopping by!
5	Awesome!! I just love Downtown Pineville. Bought a typewriter. The lady that works there is terrific!
5	I've been there a few times and each time left with a terrific bargain.  The lady is so helpful but gives you your space while you browse.  She has many great items and all at great prices too.  My problem is that I don't have enough room to put all the things I'd love to have.
