5	This is absolutely the most amazing convenience store and gas station on the planet. The beverage selection is extraordinary. Any kind of soda you can imagine, a large selection of ICEE flavors, milkshakes, any kind of coffee you could want and so much more. I stop here as often as possible.
5	I think this hold true to the entire chain, but Quick Trip is the highest quality service station. The food selection is nice. The facilities are always clean and the staff is always friendly and knowledgeable.
4	Great service and clean restrooms!
5	Best gas station ever!
5	This is possibly one of the best managed companies in the U.S.  Their chicken wraps, specifically the Southwestern Chicken Wrap and Cucumber Wrap are good and pretty darn healthy, just compare to Subway.  Easy in and out, clean restrooms.  I like the Fuel drink they offer.  I don't eat much of their other things because of my diet but have heard most things are good there.  I enjoy the Val Vista and Pecos location the most, very nice and huge.
5	True to the company standards. Quick, clean and friendly.  I love my Quick Trip. The staff greets you and recognizes you and knows you are in a hurry but makes you short visit feel personal. Thank you my QT family.
5	Always the place to stop after soccer practice for the kids to grab an inexpensive slushy drink.  They have many flavors to choose from and this location is always clean!
