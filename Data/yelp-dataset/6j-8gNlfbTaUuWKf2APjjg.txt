1	They wanted $104 to groom a cat with some matted fur, or $84 alone to groom a cat. No other groomer wanted CLOSE to this.
5	I had been looking for a Cat Groomer for quite a while. Had brought my Himalayan in to Petsmart (4 different locations) and Banfield Pet Hospital (and many others)...groomers came and went and then said they would not do him. My cat gets very stressed and is difficult to Groom. Jason from Aussie came over, picked him up and started petting him under his chin. My cat "Kasper" loved it and he usually hates men! I was very nervous, but Jason did an awesome job and he looks better than anyone else has done in the past! I love him and will be using them again. I am a very happy customer and it was well worth the cost, which was much, much less than what the Vet charged me. My grumpy cat is happy again! :)
5	Very caring and good - well worth the $$  I have 2 long hair cats that get a lion cut They come right to your home with their mobile air-conditioned van and get everything done very professionally.  They include a nail trim as well.
5	They are so good and take such good care to make our dogs have a relaxing experience. It's like a day spa for them. They were so relaxed after Kelly finished that they just dropped and slept. I loved them so much, I set up a regular schedule to have them maintained. Great job!
