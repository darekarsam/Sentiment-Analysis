5	I've known Rustem for years and always take my babies to him. I'm a diehard BMW owner and don't trust my cars with just anyone. I know I can trust Rustem to give me a fair price and not add any unnecessary  charges or 'recommendations' to my bill. I've actually taken the car to him more than once where I was convinced I had a problem and he spent 30 minutes diagnosing it, told me there wasn't anything to worry about, and didn't charge me for it. He could have take advantage of me and found something wrong with it. I love that I've found a mechanic that I can trust and recommend to my friends. Go see Rustem, I promise you won't regret it!
5	I drive a Volvo that is almost 20 years old and have been through the ringer with several local shops already. Russ is the only mechanic I have found in town that actually seems to know what he is talking about. No bs, friendly dude and really honest pricing. Thanks again Russ!
5	Russ has performed two repairs on my Volvo now.  Both jobs were completed quickly and, more importantly, perfectly.  Unlike every Volvo dealer who's worked on my car, nothing else was broken in the process and the repair didn't go way over the initial estimate.  Best of all?  His labor rate is far below what any dealer and most independent shops will charge.I have no problem recommending Russ for car repairs.  He is straightforward, honest, and believes very strongly in the power of customer satisfaction.
5	Russ is honest and reasonable.We will not allow anyone else to work on our 2 Mercedes.We have saved thousands of dollars through him and avoided the dreaded dealer drama and overcharging.He is no-nonsense and extremely knowledgeable.
