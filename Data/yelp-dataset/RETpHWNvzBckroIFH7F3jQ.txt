4	La Soupiere was a treasure find in my most recent Montreal weekend gateway.  It is a mecca for all your kitchen needs - 2 floors to fill your shopping needs.  This is a speciality store, so expect higher prices than normal.  My SO and I bought a crepe spreader that we have been searching high and low in other kitchen stores which they had!You can certainly find some unique kitchen finds at La Soupiere.  I would definitely recommend to visit this store if you are in the Mont Royal area.
5	I almost don't want to write this review because I want to keep this store all to myself!  They have THE lovliest colours of La Creuset cookware and the sharpest Santoku knives around. The service was amazing and even though when you walk in, it looks like a bomb went off in here, it is surprisingly easy to find what you're looking for.
5	Recently I was on a quest for a Danish dough hook. A what? Needless to say my usual kitchen stuff stores didn't have any. Fast forward to this Saturday morning, and I'm out for a wander along Mont Royal. I spy La Soupiere. I think back to my university days, when I would occasionally pop into the St Catherine location to browse and dream of all the wonderful stuff I might one day buy.  I go in, to check out if they might have Danish dough whisks. And they do! I only did a quick browsing, but now I know where to come when I can't find something elsewhere, or when I want to find the perfect gift for a food lover. The staff seemed friendly and attentive, without breathing down your neck. I like.
5	High priceHigh quality.Got several things there and I am very satisfied.Older gentleman with glasses who works there is a no non-sense guy. Question asked,Question answered.Direct to the point and honest, "You get what you pay for" is a phrase from him i'll remember for a long time.
1	Looks and feel like 99c store, or $1 store with prices higher than at Macy's. You have to crawl between shelves. Do not go, do not waste your time.
