5	I came in for an emergency medical appointment after accidentally lubricating my contact lens with hydrogen peroxide cleaning solution (I wish I could leave a review for whoever designed the bottle for the lense solution!). It happened on a Sunday, and I called as soon as they were open and explained the situation. They were able to squeeze me in between appointments and I was seen by the doctor within an hour of calling them initially; I only waited in the lobby for about 10 minutes or less. The entire staff was very sympathetic and helpful for my situation.  I don't recall the name of the doctor but he was young and very relaxed which helped calm me down.  The visit was out of an abundance of caution and I received a good assessment of the issue and peace of mind. The recommended treatment was effective and I am a happy customer.I was happy that they had hours on a Sunday of all days, and grateful that they could see me so quickly. The copay was reasonable and the service was excellent. 5 stars for a job well done!
5	Great experience. Very nice staff.
