5	I have wavy to curly hair. It is very difficult to find a hairstylist who is not intimidated by curly hair. After moving to Montreal, I went to four different salons. At each salon, the stylist did the opposite of what I asked, and I was always left with terrible cuts that I would have to wait to grow out. Finally, after seeing a review somewhere that Alain was the person to see in Montreal if you have curly hair, I decided to give it a chance. He did such a great job with my hair, that I didn't have to go back to get a cut for ages. The only reason I did was to get my hair coloured.... and Justin did a wonderful job there too.Now not only do I make it a point to go see Alain and Justin, I recommend them to everyone who is looking for a great hair cut. Even my husband now goes to see them.
5	I have been going to this salon for years - I have a TON of unruly, curly hair and the only person I let cut it is Alain. When he cuts my hair, it behaves. I can wear it straight, curly, whatever - it just works :)I see Justin for my colour and he always gets my blonde just right even when it seems like I am asking for the impossible. Love these guys.
