2	Poor service and very open sketchy (drug?) dealings in the parking area. My friend and I walk here for cigarettes and often see questionable activity going on. The second star is solely earned by the giant American flag that flies on this property. That thing is glorious!
1	Where to start. Hmmm... So i decided to get a quick carwash after filling up my tanks because my car was dirty. Never Never go there to get a carwash period. So basically they use little water to rinse before the wash causing me to panic if the carwash would scratch my car. Not only that the towel that they use to wash the car is soo powerful that it literally bent my license plate and little bit of cosmetic damages to the car. I did file a claim regarding this and we will see if they  will follow up with me regarding the claim.
