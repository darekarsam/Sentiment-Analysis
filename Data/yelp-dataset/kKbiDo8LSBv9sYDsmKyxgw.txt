5	I have always had good experiences with Milios.  Even if they've messed up my order or I've had some other type of complaint they always make it right.  They definately know customer service and how to keep their customers happy and coming back.
5	I can't believe I'm giving a generic chain five stars. But, this is one of the few places in the food wasteland that is the East Towne area that has food that's palatable.Plus, the service is amazing. They're so fast that I don't bother sitting down when I'm waiting for my order, because they'll call me back before I get to my chair. Every staff member I've run into has been incredibly friendly and helpful. On slow days, I've had people offer me free bread that they were going to toss. The second time I showed up here, the guy recognized me from the last time, gave me a punchcard, and puched out the first two entries.Food-wise, the service here is one of the few things I'm going to miss when I move from the far east side.
3	I generally love Milio's. I don't go there often, as it isn't really in my budget. A friend of mine and I ordered subs to be delivered on 2 different occasions. Each time, they screwed up our order, the girl on the phone was RUDE with us and was upset when we asked her to repeat the order, and when we asked for a name she hung up on us. I haven't felt inclined to order or stop in at this Milio's location since then. Can you blame me though?
5	They take great care of East Madison Toyota. Always prompt and friendly. Food is what you'd expect. Bread is way better then Subway
