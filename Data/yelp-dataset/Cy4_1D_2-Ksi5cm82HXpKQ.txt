5	One of the BEST Clinic's I've ever been to! I frequented the Women's Institute for fertility treatment and although my husband and I had never had a successful pregnancy from there, the staff and facilities were SUPERB! After I had moved out of state and left the clinic, my doctor (Dr. Hurst) and a few nurses had called me to follow up on where I was with my treatments. My doctor also mentioned  that I can call back anytime with any questions or even to chat to get his opinion on something...how awesome is that! The nurses all knew us by name as well. Everyone was super supportive! It was definitely a great group to share such an agonizing period in our lives with.
