4	And we have another new eatery in Stockbridge, this one in the form of a cozy wine bar. The interior is dark and romantic, accented with giant head sculptures and comfortable custom pillows. We were made to feel welcome from the start, and the service was good throughout. The wine list is diverse and approachable, with short descriptions to help guide your choice. Around 15 wines are offered by the glass. Every wine we tried was good, and the prices seemed about average for this area.The food plates are mostly designed for sharing. We started with the smoked aubergine on toast and mull crab bon bons, followed by the portobello mushrooms and the monkfish Thai curry. Portions are small but priced accordingly, which works out well if you'd like to try several different things. The Thai curry was my favorite dish. The mushrooms were delicious if just a tad too oily. The starters were interesting, but not amazing. For dessert we split a ginger sticky toffee pudding, which was small and tasty (and came with a disproportionately large side of clotted cream). Overall a lovely evening out.

Followed by portobello mushrooms for her and tuna steak for me. The mushrooms seemed to be oozing pesto and judging by the amount of green left on the plate, could maybe have done with a bit less. My tuna steak was perfectly cooked but the mango salsa was lacking the 'zing' that I was hoping for.I love the idea of tapa style bite size plates and the wine list is varied and easily navigated so I'd happily head back for the wine list and a light bite though probably wouldn't consider it solely as a dining option.
