4	Like great Indian food, full of amazing flavour in a casual setting then this is the place for you.Yes I admit that the decor is nothing to write home about but the food is the best, it's not fancy just authentic great tasting meals.Honestly you can't go wrong with ordering the AA meal, plus great Indian beers to go with it.
