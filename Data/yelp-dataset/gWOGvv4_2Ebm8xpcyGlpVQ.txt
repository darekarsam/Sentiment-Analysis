5	Great staff and drinks. I much prefer to frequent this establishment over mega corporate coffee shops. Quiet atmosphere and nice environment.
5	I saw this place over Groupon and I was curious where this place was at so I can try it out. ($11 for 2 $11 value groupon). A foodie from SoCal that just moved to Henderson I thought why not explore and give it a shot. At first I thought I was at the wrong place because Siri took me to a Christian school. But it's actually connected! I thought that was pretty awesome that the students and faculty has access to this cafe while they were on break or lunch. Since everything sounds delicious on the menu, I asked what would they suggest. Not knowing how much each item is on the menu, I was able to get a California avocado panini (which was originally a sandwich but they were able to turn it to a panini), Arnold Palmer with a light sweetener, & a baby Bundt cake for 10.50! Super affordable, good quality of food and very fulfilling! That baby Bundt cake tho! Oh my gawd....! Imagine a churro and cinnamon roll made a baby and came out a baby bundt cake! It's even better when it's warm as suggested by one of the employees. The employees was very warm, welcoming, and definitely patient (since I love to take my time to read up on details on the menu). I loved the atmosphere and the decor as well. Absolutely love this spot even tho it was my first time here! Definitely going to be a regular!
4	Great service and delish coffee!
