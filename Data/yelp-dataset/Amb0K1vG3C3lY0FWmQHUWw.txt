5	Absolutely love it here!  One of the doctors came highly recommended by our pediatrician back in California and we're so glad we found her.  The facilities are very clean, bright, and welcoming.  The doctors and staff are friendly and accommodating.  Although there are many other offices closer to our home, we're happy to drive over half an hour to have all three of our children seen here.

5	Great Pediatrician
