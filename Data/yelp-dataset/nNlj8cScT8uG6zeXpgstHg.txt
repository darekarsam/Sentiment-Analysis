4	Stopped in for coffee and cake.Atmosphere:  based on what I was told, this was an old bank that has been converted into a cafe/restaurant.  I loved the feel of it as you could see many of the old banks attributes worked into the interior.Staff:  the staff was friendly and attentive.  Our orders were correct and they were very polite.Food:  I can only speak to the coffee and cake we had, which was very good.  They had a much larger menu from which to select, but we decided on a lighter fair as we were walking through town.This will definitely be a place to check out during a future visit for a meal.
