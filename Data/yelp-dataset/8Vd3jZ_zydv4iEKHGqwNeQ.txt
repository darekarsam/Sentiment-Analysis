5	This is my regular spot. They are right up the road from my home, so location is perfect. The people are very friendly, very knowledgable, and they have a great selection. They run daily deals and even have a rewards program for frequent customers. Give them a shot, you won't be disappointed.
5	This place has the best edibles!! I love the daily specials and patient rewards program. The wait has never been more than a couple of minutes and the staff is amazing. I highly recommend giving Emerald Palace a try!!
