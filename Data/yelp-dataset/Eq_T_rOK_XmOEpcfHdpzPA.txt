4	Was visiting from out of town and needled some R/C supplies.  I am a novice and needed help.  They were very helpful over the phone and in person.  I walked out with a solution.  Nice selection of R/C supplies for aircraft and cars.  Also, limited supply of model rocketry and finishing supplies.  Good choice if you are interested in these areas
1	I have gone here a few times in the past because its the only place around. I have since began just ordering online. The customer service here is terrible and they make you feel really stupid. Avoid it if you can.
