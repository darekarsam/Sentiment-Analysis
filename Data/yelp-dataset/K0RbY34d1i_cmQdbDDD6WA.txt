5	We have enjoyed Jester'z for years and we absolutely love their new location. Very few places are safe to take your whole family (including kids) and not have to censor what is going on but Jester'z is truly family friendly clean entertainment.
5	Such a great night tonight! Their new location is great! I highly recommend this for an affordable Saturday night! We will be back! :)
5	They put on a great show. I've seen them three or four times and it is different each time. Teens and younger children love it as much as the adults. Truly an all ages event. I can't recommend this enough.
