5	Making our reservation with Rick was very easy and efficient. Our driver Glen was prompt and very friendly. He picked us up both ways on time and made our night complete not having to worry about driving. Can't wait to use the service again.
5	Rick's car service is top of the line.  Friendly, always on-time and courteous!  Whether you need an airport transport or just a night on the town you can't go wrong with the best.  From planned trips to last minute...I have never been told we can't help you.
