1	The park/playground is excellent. Lots of trees, nice lake area, picnic ramadas, splash pad, etc. The train is another story. We spent almost $40 for tickets for our large family to ride the train. The train broke. No big deal, we'll just get a refund and enjoy the rest of our day, right? NOPE. Train tickets are non-refundable, apparently even when the train is broken. No apology. Nothing. We live 50 miles away so it's not like we can just drop by the next day. So now I'm stuck with 40 bucks of useless train tickets that will never get used and a bad taste in my mouth for this otherwise great park.
