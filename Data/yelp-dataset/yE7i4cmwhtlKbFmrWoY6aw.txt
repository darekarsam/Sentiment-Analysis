1	The night started out with the front desk clerk not even showing up until we had been there for 10 mins. Then he screamed at the cab driver to move and stomped away only to not show up again for another 5 mins. Check in took half an hour, the wireless didn't work, the clerk couldn't even tell us how to get there when we called for directions, and the breakfast was a joke. Plus, there were stains on the bedspread and I had to strip them off the bed and there was what looked like mouse poop on the bed. Ugh, dont do it.
1	I actually tried to give this place zero stars.  A hideous experience.  The bathroom had soap which was already opened, the toilet lid was up, there was only one towel despite it being a room with two beds, and the toilet paper was almost out with no new rolls, all of which made me wonder if the bathroom had even been cleaned before we checked in.  My cot was so old and weak it kept falling down if I even sat up.  It didn't come with a pillow, and when we asked for one we were told it would arrive in 15 minutes.  It never arrived!  We tried going to the front desk to ask for a pillow and more toilet paper, but nobody was at the desk or even responding to calls or doorbell rings!  The TV had no remote.  We were told continental breakfast would be served from 7:00-10:00 but their idea of "breakfast" was getting coffee or juice from their machines.  Honestly I know this place is cheap but I cannot imagine being unable to find something much better for the same price nearby.  Everyone please avoid this place until they're forced to either treat customers better or go out of business.
1	Shady place..lost my luggage here..only go at your own risk.
