2	I heard that this place was supposedly a "great" brunch place, so i decided to check it out with a friend. My dish was average and the cocktail juice was overpriced. Nothing special about it. wouldnt go again
2	Someone recommended us to go to this place for breakfast and brunch.It's local not too far. The price is quite steep here, on par with eggspectations downtown?!?!We ordered some eggs bacon sausage with french toast and fruits, and a eggs benedict plate.Everything was average to poor quality, the fruits haven't fresh since last week and it's on my plate lol.I did like the baked beans, that tasted good... my eggs benedict was not too good, it just lacks something... the hollandaise sauce was off, it was bland...The coffee was lukewarm, The service though was impeccable, our waitor refilled our coffee 3 times and we were there for barely 30 min, to bad I only rate on food otherwise they would get one more star for service :)
