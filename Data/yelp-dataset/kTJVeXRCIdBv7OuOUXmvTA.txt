4	If there was a sauce that could instantly put you in a place of pure extacy and as each bite bring your mouth to water like niagra fall. Then Kojax's has got it with their mild sauce. As for their nenu eh and for the life of me I would truly would like to know how does a greek restaurant has the nerve to sell Taco's and doesn't koptia with that mild sauce . I guess a lack gonads to be the Only place that would offer such a delicious treat .
3	Enjoyed my lunch today, and I only went because of their coupons. Ordered 2 pitas (the beef/pork gyro was way better than the classic chicken, which had burnt parts served) but the sauce was excellent. Found the portion sizes small compared to shish taouks that I have had. I know, I know, not the same, but they're pretty darn similar.
4	Been going to Kojax since my teen years.   Big fan of the mild sauce use for Souvflaki.   Best time is the one on St-Catherine street, between Bishop and Crescent, 3am after the bars close.  Nothing like a Souvflaki Pita (porc of course) with that mild sauce to finish the night!
