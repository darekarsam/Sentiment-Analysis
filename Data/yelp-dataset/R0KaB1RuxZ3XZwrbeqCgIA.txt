5	Around the corner from the Econo Lube on Albermarle Road, tucked into a small lot, you'll find a car service called Mr. Inpsection.  This place is a true find.  Where the Econo Lube is short on personality, Mr. Inspection is great.  Every time I've been in, they've been very friendly.The best part is that the prices are very competitive and because of the location, it's easy to get in and out, since they are almost always not as busy as other locations that might be easier to spot from a major road.You will pay a bit more around the corner, but pony up the extra few bucks - it's a nicer facility and the staff is definitely worth it.
4	I typically go to Mr. Inspection for the minor oil changes on our vehicles, and then take them to the big-name mechanic for the major services.  It isn't that  think that Mr. Inspection couldn't do those services, it's just that I like the peace of mind that having two different sets of eyes provides.Also, Mr. Inspection is a touch cheaper, and since we're typically there several times a year for the regular service and inspections, it can save a bit of coin.  They also get us in and out quickly, which is nice.
4	Great customer service and they are efficiently thorough. I've been going to them for my car needs since my best friend told me about them. They'll explain any issues in plain terms. I'll drive past several auto shops because they're fair, honest and reasonable.
