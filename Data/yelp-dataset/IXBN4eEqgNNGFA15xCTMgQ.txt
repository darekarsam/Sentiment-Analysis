5	The rates here are perfectly reasonable. I have no idea if it costs women more, but it costs me less than $20 for my haircut. I do see an equal number of males and females in this place. Katie, specifically, is fantastic. She is very smooth and efficient, but double checks to make sure everything is right before sending me on my way. Couldn't recommend this place more.
5	I have been coming here for several years!  Laurie and Katie are both extremely friendly!  Katie does a fabulous job styling my hair, and has been doing so for several years!  I get compliments all of the time, and recommend Hair by Design to many people!
5	I just got a haircut at Hair by Design and couldn't be more stoked. After moving to Pittsburgh about a year and a half ago, I have struggled to find a really good place to get my hair cut. My search is over. Hair by Design is THE place. They gave me a a top notch haircut at a fair price in a clean, pleasant, and comfortable atmosphere. They are very friendly and extremely professional.  Everybody goes to "The Strip"  now and then-take a little stroll up the road and see what I'm talking about.
