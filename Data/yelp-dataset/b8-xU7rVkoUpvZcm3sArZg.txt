5	The service is is always friendly. I am always able to walk in and talk to an associate and get a quote. This is also a place I trust and will not try to add extra unnecessary work to up the cost. I needed my whole AC unit replaced in my car. Fortunately Dan was willing to change it out for me. I still needed to take my car and get the AC vacuumed and charged. Since it was late in the evening Friday afternoon, I asked if I could just drop it off and pick it up the next day. They had my car ready pretty early Saturday! Best part is they did a great job on charging my AC! It runs so cold! I am no longer melting. I will for sure bring my car back, see y'all in a few months for inspection!
5	Super quick for both inspection and oil change. In and out in nearly 15minutes! No need for an appointment. Everyone working there is very friendly. Will certainly be going back and sending referrals.
1	Awful! They stole my phone charger out of my car while I got an inspection. When I went back inside and simply asked if it had fallen out of the car, the guy who I suspected of taking told me they don't steal out of cars. He seemingly admitting guilt when I was implying it was only lost. Then he described the cord as a white iPhone charger but then said that he didn't see anything like that in my car. I'm outraged and will be contacting management!
4	I needed an oil change in a hurry and they took care of me right away. The waiting room leaves much to be desired, but since they are so quick, I guess they haven't had any complaints. If you want fast, honest service, give them a try. No pushy guys trying to sell you tires or telling you your engine is going to fall out if you don't spend an extra $1000 today. Just a couple of nice people doing what you came in for. Also, Tuesday is ladies day and what woman doesn't dream of discounted oil changes? I believe this will be my new regular spot.
