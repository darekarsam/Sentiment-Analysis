3	No-frills, strip mall "salon" gets it done, quickly, easily, and inexpensively. Sometimes, there's a bit of a wait, but it's nothing too bad. I generally get a pedicure and facial waxing done, and I find it to be a solid value. But honestly, I go for the chairs. I love those chairs. Cheaper than an hour-long  massage, and I get to be beautified while I get pounded. Perfect.
4	This is my  "go to" nail salon in the Plaza Midwoodish area.  I have tried quite a few in the area, and I end up back at this one everytime.If you do gel, this is the most reasonable price in the area, they charge $25.Pedicures are $25 and regular manicures are $12.They have the vibrating chairs and also do waxing.  There is sometimes a wait...but they are usually pretty quick.  Weekdays are best!  It's in the Family Dollar plaza across from Ross/Food Lion.  A little sketch but the Police station is a few store fronts down so there's never any issues.My favorite nail tech is the woman straight in front when you first walk in.  Her gel manis last me a full 2- 2 1/2 weeks and the regular manis always last a full week!The clientele can be very interesting.....at least go for the entertainment factor!   ;)
5	They made me feel at home.. Or was that the complementary glass of wine?! :) that's kept me coming back and sending friends to for the last 6 yrs! Mr Le keeps his staff happy so there's always a positive vibe... Open to 8 most nights, appointments are strongly recommended for fri-sat
