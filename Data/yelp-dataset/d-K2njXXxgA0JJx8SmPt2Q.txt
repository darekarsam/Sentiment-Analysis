3	Had the Singapore spicy noodle and salt-n-spicy soft shell crab.  The noodle was ok, a bit on the bland side.  The crab was tasty.  It was soggy by the time it was delivered, but I wonder if it'd be crispier at the restaurant.  Price was comparable to other Chinese restaurants at around GBP 7-9 per dish.  I'd give it an extra half stars for its super quick delivery.
