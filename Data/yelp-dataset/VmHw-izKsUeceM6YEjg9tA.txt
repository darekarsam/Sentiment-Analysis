5	After having WAY too many problems with Associated, my boyfriend and I switched over the UW Credit. We set up our accounts at this location and go here for almost every thing due to the closeness to our apartment. Setting up to savings accounts and a joint checking took a bit longer than we expected, but not too terribly long. Some one was available to do the process when we walked in the door. The person we worked with was incredibly nice and seemed amused by our astonished reactions to their policies. Neither of us have ever used a credit union and we were just so amazed by how much better it sounded.We have been using them ever since and haven't had an issue. My boyfriend and I are still not used to it. We're constantly expecting to screwed over, but it hasn't happened once! UW Credit puts through all purchases, deposits, and withdraws right away so we've never had an issue with accidentally over spending. The verify log in made linking to PayPal and Amazon Payments a little difficult, but it wasn't too bad. I love verify log ins so I'm pretty happy about it, despite the inconveniences. If you're thinking about switching, I highly suggest making the plunge. I'm mad at myself for ever dealing with banks when I could have been using a credit union.
