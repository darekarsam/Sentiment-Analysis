1	They never showed up for cleaning despite makindg the appointment days before. No calls to explain or apologize.
5	Very accommodating to my schedule.  Ladies did a fantastic job.  Very thorough cleaning process including dusting all baseboards, polishing all bath and kitchen fixtures. Awesome attention to detail.  My home looks like a new model house!  Very pleased with service and would recommend to others!
5	This company is purely amazing. Quick and to the point when they arrive to handle business. They are always on time and the owner Leslie is extremely good with communication. I'm a huge fan of their business model as they show up to every cleaning with a minimum of 3 maids. Each maid tackles a different area in the house and BAM they are out of my house in less than an hr. I never really liked services with 1 maid in your house for 6 hours cleaning so this is great for those paranoid home owners. A+++++. Been using them for over 2 years and never once a NO SHOW, a stolen item, or even a broken item. Just a great service.
