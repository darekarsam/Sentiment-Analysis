3	The majority of the food is pretty bland, not very filling and definitely overpriced. If you're there to watch a game then the bar area is really nice, but if you're there for the food then you definitely will not be blown away.
4	I was surprised, the food is really good, big portions, very nice flavours and good combination. Outstanding fish & chips , well buttered and not oily. Bloody Caesar was good, well spiced , good ratio of vodka to juice. Kids meal of good portion. Service was fast and reliable. Welcoming stuff and nice decor. This is my second time here and i would definitely recommend it.
