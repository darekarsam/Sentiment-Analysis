5	Physical Therapy is what ya get out of it... If you work hard then the physical therapist is just assisting you to do your best. Thats what I love about this place... So much motivation and a positive energy that helps me to do my best.I had brain surgery that landed me in a wheel chair since 2006. My doctor saw how much strength was in my legs ( thanks Dr Tran !! ) and he sent me to this awesome location.. watch my playlist on youtube to see my progress !!http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8A3391915DC443A9Friendly people and an awesome staff!!
3	The people are nice and the facility is clean. However, trying to get an appointment and the scheduling of treatments is sub par at best. The telephone etiquette leaves a lot to be desired. When trying to cancel, reschedule or set an appointment I was put on hold several times and they never did get back to me. The three star rating is not about the therapy. It Is Totally About the Office proceedurs.
