5	THANK YOU ROB! i truly appreciated all the help i received from this agent today who was able to removed the extra charges on my bill that the Pasadena Verizon Store on Lake was charging me on my bill for upgrading my phone.   When i went in i was having problems with my Blacberry and had to switch to the Iphone last week. Rob from the Pennsylvania store who i was connected today was able to look at my bill and all the notes and correct the problem immediately. Great Customer Service! He even set up a FOLLOW UP Phone Call with me On July 5th to make sure the credit goes through on my bill...I can't thank him enough!!!!
2	After waiting for almost 30 minutes to trade in an old phone part of the buy back program, our customer service rep incorrectly processed the transaction. This led to us waiting another 30 minutes for him to correct it. Don't visit this store if you want pleasant or good service.
4	I visited this store several months ago to simply ask about smartphone plans. The agent was pleasant and helpful. I would recommend a visit to this store.
