3	Visited Wisconsin Vision for an eye exam and to order corrective lenses...very professional service, Saturday appts available...placed an order for lenses and frames with the optical center, but had to cancel after I received a message that they had quoted incorrectly and the price would be much higher and would take up to 6-8 weeks.  Good selection of frames, including some designer frames.
5	After a very bad experience at Stanton Optical, it was a breath of fresh air to be greeted by Susan at Wisconsin Vision. She helped me pick out my frames and helped me save 100$  on my frames at the register. It was very affordable and enjoyable. I will return there for my next pair.
5	Wonderful. My girlfriend had to pick up her new glasses from them and they were really great. They greeted us as soon as we walked in and were very polite. The woman behind the counter was helpful and made sure the glasses fit exactly right. She even complimented my girlfriend on her selection which really made me smile. All in all, great experience.
5	I have lived in Madison my entire life, 28 years, & I have needed glasses since I was about 15 years old. I have gone to many different places in Madison for eye exams and frames, but I have never had such a good experience as I had at this place. The price was good, they had online offers, they even offered me a deal that wasn't advertised. The exam was competent and thorough, the people working there were extremely helpful and had very constructive input when helping me choose my frames. This is been the best experience I've ever had shopping for new glasses. It is usually a terrible chore that I don't look forward to, but the people at Wisconsin Vision really helped to make it an enjoyable experience, I highly recommend them.
