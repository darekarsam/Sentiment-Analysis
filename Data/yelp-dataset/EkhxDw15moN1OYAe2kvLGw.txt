5	Discount Tire is great and glad to have one in Tega Cay now. The service is good, employees are friendly, and they focus on what they do best - wheels and tires. Expect fair pricing and fast service.
1	I like the brand discount tire but this one in tega cay has a bunch of kids running it.  Brought my car here to get the tires rotated and no one was here (customers) They were just standing around instead of working on my car.  I own a car dealership up in Mooresville nc and spend a ton of money on tires up at that discount tire.  This one needs help,  training and showing here crew people what a sense of urgency is.  The more cars you get in and out the more money you make.   By the way 9 employees here and I have been here for an hour.  Not coming back to this location.
