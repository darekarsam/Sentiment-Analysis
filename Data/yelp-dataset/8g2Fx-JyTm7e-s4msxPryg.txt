2	Disappointed..polish already peeling and it's only been a couple of days :(
5	At nails of the world they actually care about u as a person. They do great work & my polish never peals. They are Always friendly. I've been going there for a couple years now & I would recommend nails of the world to anyone of my friends & family.
5	Best nail salon I've been to in AZ and I have gone to many nail salons.  Make an appointment with Tracy she is the best, I go to her every 2 weeks.  I don't go to anyone else, but I hear that the other ladies do a good job also.
5	Came in for the first time today and I was greeted promptly with no waiting. The girl who did my pedicure and gel manicure was excellent and very friendly.  Several regulars came in and were treated like family. Great atmosphere. Will definitely be coming back, even though other nail salons are closer!
5	The best nail art ever. They do such a good job with nail art.
