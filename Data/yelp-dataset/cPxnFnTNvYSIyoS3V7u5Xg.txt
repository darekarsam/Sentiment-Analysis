1	i'm on the west coast - my relatives are on the east coast. they order flowers for me. they contact blue diamond florist because it is close to my home. they send me a picture of the flowers i am to receive.  my flowers arrive and OMG!  THERE ARE NO FLOWERS...it is all GREENERY!  i call the florist.  i get the owner...SARA.  she tells me IN POOR ENGLISH that she followed the recipe for the flowers.  WHAT?  you need a recipe?  and if so....YOU DIDN"T FOLLOW THE RECIPE!  I am sure TELAFLORA DID NOT TELL YOU TO FILL THE VASE WITH GREENS AND THROW IN TWO FLOWERS!!!  I tried dealing with this woman on this arrangement and she just did not understand a thing i was saying. I TOLD HER TO DELIVER ANOTHER ARRANGEMENT!!  My relatives did NOT pay for fern....they paid for FLOWERS!  the delivery guy comes, the flowers - or should i say - greenery and FOUR flowers were wilted.  he tells me he doesn't know how she stays in business because he gets complaints from just about every person he delivers flowers to.  he is retired and just wants a little job on the side to stay busy and he is finding this job to be quite amuzing.  bottom line is:  i would NEVER recommend this florist to my worst enemy that would just be toooo cruel.  this lady is trying to make a fast buck off people by filling her arrangements with GREENRY and cutting back on the flowers.  FLOWERS IS WHAT WAS PAID FOR.....the pictures online SHOW you what the arrangement looks like and SHE JUST CAN'T DO IT or maybe she just refuses to do it so she can rake in the money and laugh the entire way to the bank on us AMERICANS!  GO THE HELL BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM!!!!! YOU WON'T EVER RIP ME OR ANY OF MY FRIENDS OFF AGAIN!!!
1	dont make the mistake I did and drive here. They are no longer at this address, but there is a number on the door to call. I never called just went to another florist.
5	Impress me yearly w/ beautiful arrangements, delivered on time.  I moved back to Texas a few yrs back but have been using them since they opened.  They make me look like a rock star w/ my family still in LV.  Staff is kind and professional.  Recommend!
5	We went with Blue Diamond for our wedding parties foral arrangement and they did an amazing job. Everything looked great and was there on time which was especially good in our situation since we had 14 people (7men/7women)
