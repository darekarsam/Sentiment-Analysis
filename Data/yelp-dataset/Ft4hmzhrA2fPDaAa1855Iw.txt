5	One of the best haircuts in town!I've been going to Scotch & Scissors and nowhere else since they've opened. From the GQ ambience to the straight razor shave, Adrian and his team really excel at the entire barbering experience. Indeed, getting a haircut at S&S is a rewarding and enjoyable experience.They also carry a great line of Suavecito products that are far superior and much more affordable than any other salon product I've tried so far.
5	Stumbled upon this gem of a barbershop today - great haircut with a hipster vibe without the attitude or condescension. Nice people, great haircut, reasonably priced, and scotch on the house...what more could one ask for?
5	Being new to the city I am so glad I found this place. Awesome atmosphere, great people and a quality haircut to match. I'll be back again soon!
