3	Cheap eats and free delivery! Offering several different styles of Asian cuisine including sushi, thai, szechwan and more. The dinning room is a bit drab and outdated (I think it used to be a diner before...?) so I usually opt for delivery. The sushi is always fresh and they've always been able to substitute tofu in any dish for my vegetarian friends. Nothing mind blowing but a decent, inexpensive option in the neighborhood.
3	Super fast delivery, and really nice delivery guy.The delivery portions were tiny for $11, and the pepper chicken was ridiculously spicy, and this is coming from someone who puts black pepper on everything. If you're going to add that much black pepper, balance it out with some lemon or lime, unless you like a mouthful of fire. The crispy spinach was good and sweet though.
