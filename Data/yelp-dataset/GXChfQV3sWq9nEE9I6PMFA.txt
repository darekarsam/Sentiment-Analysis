4	one of the best shop in town to buy running shoes.it is very expensive but that's what running shoes are, expensive but your feet will love you for it!they do sell clothing too but you're better off buying from other places as those are quite pricey too.selection for both shoes and clothing is great. you'd probably find what you're looking for.staff is competent and extremely helpful. they do let you browse around for a while which is good.
