5	I never thought I'd review a liquor store, but here I am...A month or 2 ago I was on my way to a friends house and needed to grab a 6-pack and didn't feel like dealing with going to Fry's.  I live nearby and have passed this place daily for the last 2 year but had never stepped inside.  There was plenty of selection and the prices were decent.  The staff is friendly and always good for a laugh.Since then Greenway Liquor has become my go-to place for my alcoholic needs, and I will be coming back again and again.
5	have been using these guys for a while! they have been taking great care of our party kegs and other needs for 3 years! we dont go anywhere else!
5	Great selection and great customer service. And there's a drive thru. I've been a customer for 8 years, no complaints!
1	Over the last twenty years or so, I've come to Greenway Liquor to get the drinks for any major event that my family has hosted, or I've gone to even if driving to them was out of my way. I used them because of their customer service and product selection. Over the years I've referred friends and family to them, However, the last several visits have swayed my opinion of the store. The rude clerk behind the counter who gives off attitude when asking for him to do what he's payed for and gives a discussed look at a paying customer, then just puts the merchandise on the counter to the drive up window and clears his throat as his acknowledgment that my order is ready,  is not appropriate customer service. This is a reoccurring event from this person and he's causing a loyal customer of almost twenty years to take her business elsewhere. I'm not the only person that has had this issue with the lack of customer service. It's a shame because the store used to be about quality service, not what it's become.
