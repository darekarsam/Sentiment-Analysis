4	Very knowledgeable, experienced staff, if not a tad on the snooty side. Got a great deal on a custom mini-grand piano by Walters a few years ago (yes, I bargained) and have been very happy with it ever since. Be sure to get your piano tuned every year in case you ever want to trade it in for cash. Financing available, as are used pianos, lessons, special events, and more. A Madison institution!
4	I've never actually been to the store (I feel like I would need to go in at least once in order to give 5 stars, if that makes sense), but used them to move and store my piano for quite some time while I personally moved around the country and got settled into a more permanent home.Tad was always very helpful, and answered all my questions in a knowledgable manner. He was able to advise whether it made sense to move a piano or sell it via consignment through them. He also gave several recommendations for movers since they don't take pianos cross country.I'm currently making arrangements to get the piano to me now, a move down to Texas. Depending on how everything works out, I will update at some future time (no news is good news). I don't expect a piano that has been in storage for several years to be in tune, but I'm hoping the condition is still good.UPDATE (August 2014)The piano arrived in very good condition, apart from a little dust and some cobwebs inside (I think they are just covered in blankets in the storage area? not sure). I used Keyboard Carriage for the long distance part of the move, and a local mover in Texas to bring it to my house. Lots of phone calls paid off.
5	Farley's conducted a very efficient move of our upright piano from Pewaukee to Madison, in a timely fashion at a reasonable price.  It arrived in perfect condition and the customer service was great!  Thanks, Tad
