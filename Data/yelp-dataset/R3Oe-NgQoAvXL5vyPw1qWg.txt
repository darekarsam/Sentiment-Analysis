3	I was lost getting to a place where I shouldn't have been lost, but I ended up in Brentwood of all places.  It was all good when I stumbled upon Peets, my preferred afternoon coffee of San Francisco!I had heard rumors that Peets was moving in the area, and it's a nice surprise.  A stronger and bolder bean when stacked up against Starbucks, DD, and McDonalds.With that being said, I ordered a small vanilla latte, and it was rather weak for a Peets latte so perhaps there are a few kinks to work out.Go for the iced lattes (sugar free too), the foamy milk top is the best!
3	I always love to see new business come to the Burgh, and Peets is new. First, it's not Starbucks. Like Jim Cramer says, when you a looking to own a stock, you buy the best company, "best of breed" as he says. When you want good coffee go to Starbucks. When you need a change of pace, Peets is good, Caribou is good, your local pop and mom is good. But you always go back to Starbucks. They have some flavors Starbucks hasn't used, IE the maple latte. It was okay, they had a few samples sitting there. I did enjoy a dark roast while there. Reminiscent of Starbuck's espresso roast, thick syrupy, tart with smokey notes and a sweet after taste. Again, if I'm traveling and there's not Starbucks and peets is around, it's not a bad thing.
