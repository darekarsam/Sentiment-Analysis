5	I went to work out here for the first time. The staff is very friendly and I can workout with being bothered by other distractions. If you want a no nonsense place to work out this is it.
5	I just moved to Las Vegas and I was specifically looking for a gym which catered to powerlifters and I found it here. Apparently it only opened a few weeks before I arrived. This gym has a pretty good selection of equipment. They have a monolift with safety chains so you can squat solo. They have two big deadlift platforms. They have various chains and bands. They have a power cage. They have 3 flat benches. Also they have several pairs of each weight of dumbbells. Unfortunately they don't have a glute ham raise bench but maybe they will get one. I was told that they will be getting some squat racks. They have a squat bar and two power bars (no deadlift bar but hopefully they will have get one). They also have various platforms for box squats and elevated deadlifts. They provide chalk which is pretty awesome. They also have camera tripods which is incredibly useful so I can review my technique. Owners are really nice. They will give you a spot if you need one. The gym is also hosting some powerlifting meets which is pretty cool and trying to put a team together. This gym has a lot of potential!
5	Great gym...awesome equipment, superfriendly-supercool management and really nice atmosphere for those who take their workouts seriously.
