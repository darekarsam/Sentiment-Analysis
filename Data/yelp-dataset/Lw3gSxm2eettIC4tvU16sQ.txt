5	I had to laugh the other day when  I read in the paper that Jenny Ha's was attacked for being a nazi pub. You simply couldn't get nicer people in one place! All the staff are welcoming, friendly and make you feel at total ease, even though there is a degree of locality to it. It is a nice, simple pub with a great atmosphere and really comforting. It reminded me of Christmas in a funny way. If you're visiting the parliament it's definitely worth a visit for a wee tod or a dram or two on your way back up the royal mile.
5	Like Emily I'm slightly baffled at the way in which Jenny's was branded a Nazi pub. I found it exceptionally welcoming, with lovely blond-haired punters happy to discuss their passion for neat moustaches and precision engineering. The staff are all quite cheerful as well, and despite it's location, everything about the pub, down to the signage and colour scheme, tells you it's aimed more at rowdy locals than tourists.it's worth a stop to take away the crushing disappointment you'll invariably have just experienced if you've been stung for a tenner at Holyrood Palace.
2	Ummm. I guess we should've gone for the beer & booze and not the food?  Our lunch here last month could only be charitably called mediocre.  I'm not even going into details, other than to say we thought the frozen food service delivery lorry must make regular stops here.
4	A quintessential Scottish pub (in my American opinion at least!).  Nothing like some Haggis Nachos after a long hike up to Arthur's Seat!  A great back to sit back, relax, and enjoy an afternoon in Edinburgh (with a football game or two on TV, no doubt)!
