5	Hello North LV Yelpers!So I want to give a BIG shout out to my favorite neighborhood/ favorite LV 7 11 for supporting my drinking addiction! Keeping me fueled up during my summer semester here in Vegas.I've been coming here 4 times a week the last 8 weeks getting my french vanilla fix to start my early mornings on campus. Now that summer semester is done, I can kick my habit to the curb!Last month I stopped by around 9am and this month I stopped by around 630am and grabbing my first drink of the day never took me less then 5 minutes! Fast, easy, cheap! I love 7 11! I've been to many 7 11s to pick up my french vanilla, but other 7 11 machines didn't have what I was looking for... the perfect taste. Watered down drinks are horrible! My favorite morning school drink cost under $2 making it an affordable addiction!For the most part, there's always parking spaces. Gas prices are reasonable. Close to the 15. Friendly service.Grab your goods on the go! with 7 11!Yay for cheap coffee!- Miss Yelp 2011
5	Why is this the most awesome 7-11 in Las Vegas?? Now serving hot spam musubi and pork hash!! Gotta love it....bringing the Hawaii franchise trend to sin city makes us islanders feel at home. Hope other 7-11s will catch on and maybe add the hot lupchong manapua! As we would say..."garanz ballbaranz" Hawaiians will make their way to these locations!!
4	Convenient for school and really friendly staff. Gets really busy sometimes and gas prices are higher than average but it's right off of the freeway
