1	These people are just horrible with any form of paperwork.... Dangerously horrible. Twice they have not done the proper paperwork to refill my insulin prescription, both times being despite constant reminders to fax the proper paperwork. Seriously, how many times must I ask them before they fax a single paper?! An entire month advance notice and they only send the fax the very day I run out, resulting in me having to go buy insulin on my own (I'm part of a discount insulin program, but I have to get it from the doctor who has to renew the paperwork every 3 months), costing me $150! This is just the tip of the grief these people cause me. I'm switching to a new doctor as soon as I've got insurance that will allow me. Save yourself the hassle and find someone else for your medical needs!
4	My doctor was great dr Charlie I think was her name she really explains everything out ! She isn't like most doctors who will just give you meds and tell you see you later she actually cares. She gave me natural stuff and really cares checks everything to make sure nothing's wrong with you . Best doctor. Just verrrrery long wait times
1	Absolutely horrible! !! Waited 3 hours to see the doctor. The reception is ghetto and needs to find another job. No respect for their patients.  They make you wait 3 hours to see the doctor. Don't go!! Didn't want to pick a star but you have too.
1	Horrible experience overall. Went a year ago and still dealing with billing issues.  Called and made an appointment well in advance and still waited over 2 hours to see anyone.  I would not recommend this office.
