1	The service here is horrible!!  They recently opened within the last couple months on the lot that used to be Arby's.  They have screwed up mine and two of my co-workers orders the last 3 times we have went.  That's batting 100!  The drive through is slower than molasses and takes a good 15 minutes, even when there is only one car in front of you.  I don't understand how it takes so long to not even make an order right.  I even sat and watched an employee check my bag like 5x so of course, I'd assume it was correct.   And fast food workers want $15/hr?  Yea right!!
2	The food was decent.i wouldn't put it any higher then two stars my drinks was watery and the chicken was cook uneven.but my sides were great the mash potatoes were good and the Mac and cheese was exceptional and the service well to be continued.
1	I love church's chicken but this location is ridiculous.  The employee are super slow and rude. I'm assuming it was the manager had his pants sagged so much you can see his sweaty marks in his undwrwear. I'll definitely be contacting Corp because if that's the manager there's a huge problem. It's weird they are so slow because all the food is already made.
