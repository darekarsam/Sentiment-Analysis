4	I've been coming to this store for several years while living in Montreal.  It is somewhat difficult to browse around the store as everything is in plastic casings and you have to ask an employee if you want to open something up to look at it.  Unless you know what you are looking for, this might not be the best choice of stores for comics.  I've bought some pretty terrible stuff here as a result of this policy, and just feel too obliged to buy if I asked to have it opened so I never do. Employees are generally very nice. I had a box here for many years and they would call me to let me know if I had items in which was really nice.  I even saw one of the employees on the street once and not only did he remember me by name, he mentioned that they had just received a new comic for me in my box!!
4	I bought the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles book here in early 1985, when this location was Decarie and Queen Mary. Even before they had those 3 arcade machines. When that location closed down, I didn't know it was relocated. I did find this new location MANY years later and.. and I'll always be a fan.
5	YEEAAHHHHH!! I bought some Comics in NYC Midtown last year, kept those in my deak at work, thinking the line would get to a point where I have time to just read some pages there and there. Didn't happen, So i started 2 months ago to read my BAtman and bought everything. At first I bought some volume in Indigo Chapter but those motherfu... are just so darn expensive. In an Act of Friendship and Brotherhood of Geekyness a dude told my about Capitaine Quebec kinda close to the indigo on Ste-Catherine. Went there, talk with the guy about Batman and bought a bunch of comic. I will most likely be the Duke of the Store in the month to come as I had good service, great amount of quality and personalize customer service. I SHALL RETURN!
