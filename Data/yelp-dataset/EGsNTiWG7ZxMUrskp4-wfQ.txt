4	When all you need is something fast and filling, this is the place to be! Chicken Souvlaki, Burgers, Poutine, Pizza, Onion Rings... Miracle has it all, and it's a great place to chill out and grab some "health" food particularly after a long 12 hour day of working. In St-Henri there are many different other pizza/burger joints, but this is the one for me!
2	Typical Montreal greasy spoon. The service from the waitress was great and quick, to burger was the expected mediocre. The biggest problem was the poutine.  I love poutine, and never (I mean NEVER) should it be grated cheese instead of curds.  Get a clue, you are THE? greasy spoon in St. Henri, get some curds.
5	best place for delivery in the south west area. Great pizza, submarines, and chicken souvlaki, not the cheapest place but best for price vs quality. if youre in verdun i dont recommend ordering during the rush hour, 12-2 or 5-7, theyre too busy and will take along time to arrive
