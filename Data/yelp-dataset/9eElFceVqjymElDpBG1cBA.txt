4	This place is GREAT!  I have been going to this location for a few years now and they really do a good job.  They listen to exactly what you want and always tend to offer their personal opinion or addition.  I have never had a bad cut from these people.*Downside Alert*It seems they are constantly changing employees.  There are a FEW that have been there for the long haul, but the majority of them move on to different locations or what-not.*Final Say*Give it a shot!  They have frequent customer cards that you can redeem for a free haircut, and the barbers/stylists are extremely nice.  What have you got to lose (except some unwanted hair)?
3	I have to downgrade my initial rating.  Why, you ask?  Because they buzzed over the ginormous mole on my neck and caused a spurting geyser of blood.i give them 3 stars because after they personally injured me, they gave me a free haircut! Ooo thx! :D
2	When they tell you it will be 15 minutes, expect to be waiting 25. They screw up on a regular basis, but give customers money off of the haircut. Not very friendly, yet talk about the dumbest stuff with each other. Go someplace else if you can.
1	NEVER AGAIN! This was the first time I brought my 9 year old son here. There were 2 women working. We were brought back by an older woman who didn't say much. She was not friendly and did not do a very good job with the haircut. The top was uneven and the side had a patch of hair shorter than the rest. I asked if she could do a little more to even it out. In the end it was tolerable, but I would not say the haircut looked good. Neither of the women were very nice or professional. It was the kind of service you would expect from a McDonalds employee.
