2	This is a full service Wells Fargo branch, complete with all the full inside banking as well as a drive thru.  Most of the employees here and nice.  I've had a few grumps deal with me before, but they weren't so bad that I got pissed off.Being that it's on the corner of Durango and Warm Springs, it can make entering and especially exiting the parking lot a bit of a hassle.  It's just a very busy intersection with a non-stop flow of cars from all angles, so waiting a few minutes to pull out can unfortunately be normal here.  For that reason alone I don't use this branch that frequently, even thou it is the closest one to my house.  Unless I just need to do that quick transaction, or if it's late when the traffic has died down a bit and I need to hit the ATM real quick, I usually stick to the branch off of W Tropicana.
