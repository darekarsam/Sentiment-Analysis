5	Sasha gets to know her clients and their needs. She's not one to show her clients anything out of their price range. She helped me buy a home while my husband was still in NY, I thought this would be a nightmare but Sasha was great at guiding us through the process. She knows the business and is great at what she does. She's also very involved in the community
5	Sasha is a knowledgable realtor. Her expertise in home value and the area is helpful in selling as well as locating the home of your dreams. I would highly recommend her for all your real estate needs.
