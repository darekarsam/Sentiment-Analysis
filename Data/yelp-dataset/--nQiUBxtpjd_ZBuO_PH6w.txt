5	I am soooo happy I found Miss Melinda! My 6 year old has learning/developmental challenges, and I have had very little luck finding someone I feel comfortable with -    I recently moved across town, and needed to find a new sitter/occasional daycare.   My daughter loved her from the start.  Melinda is a former teacher and offers tutoring as well - something I plan to take advantage of in the future.The flexible hours are important for me,too.  At home my daughter talks happily about all the cool activities she's done, and asks when she can go back and see Miss Melinda again - I reckon that's the clearest review of all :)
5	I am very happy with Melinda. She is very accommodating and flexible to my needs. My boys (7 & 4) ask to go to her house. I feel very comfortable leaving my boys with Melinda. She was a blessing in my search for a new provider. I highly recommend her.
5	I absolutely love Melinda she is the most sweetest lady ever she helped my son be complete with his potty training. He has great manners because of her I love it when I pick him up she tells me about him. How he tells  me things he does everyday. I recommend  her more than any daycare. He loves all the little girls and boys that go there. Anytime I need her she is willing to help me as I'm a single mom going to work and school  full time she's the best love her to death..
