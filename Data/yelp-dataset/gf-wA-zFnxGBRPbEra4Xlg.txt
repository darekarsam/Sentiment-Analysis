3	In a nutshell, if you need to speak to a pharmcist at this location (in person of over the phone), make sure you're dealing with Matthew (who is AWESOME).  Eric is not very friendly, and short with people.    5 Stars - Matthew0 Stars - Eric

3	Okay store with okay location.  One time I was putting my phone into my pocket, the employee thought I was stealing.  I just told him that I was just putting my phone away.  And you are not allow to take the shopping cart and leave the store, very weird security measurement.  After all, this is somewhat a clean store.
