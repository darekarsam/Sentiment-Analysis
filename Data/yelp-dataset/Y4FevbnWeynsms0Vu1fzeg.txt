5	Very good and extremely reasonable priced lunch menu.I had the prego sandwich with soup (potato chorizo) and a creamy sour and sweet dessert.The meat in the prego sandwich was succulent and tasty. The poached eggs was a little over cooked but nonetheless was tasty. The only drawback was the order my lunch came in. It started with dessert then drinks them main and finished with the soup.
3	Looking for decent but pricey sandwiches in Old Montreal ? Well, Look no further coz Cantinho de Lisboa offers exactly that. Sandwiches that taste good (not great) come neatly packaged in a nice takeout box and a fancy paper bag. If you get a combo during lunch (Sandwich plus soup/salad), you get a tiny complimentary dessert. So next time you are in old Montreal and you wish for a fancy takeout box and neat paper bag, and if you are hungry.... Then THIS is the place you go to. Or if you just want a great sandwich, walk across the street and grab one from O&G.Food : GoodService :FastAmbiance : CozyWorth the price : umm......err...... maybe
