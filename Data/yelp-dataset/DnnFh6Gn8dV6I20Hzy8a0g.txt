2	We ordered from this place off of grubhub. Although their delivery was done in a very timely manner they didn't put much effort in their food. The rolled tacos were hard and chewy instead of crunchy & apparently CHEESE cost a lot of money because in my Super Nachos order they forgot it. There was literally 25% of what there should've been not to mention it looked like a 3yr old put the order together. The cheese was also lacking in my boyfriends quesadilla. I would've ordered extra cheese right off the bat but they change an extra $3.00 just for that. So make sure you look at your order before you get it delivered or picked up.
3	To expensive and small portions. I would go across the street and eat at La Presa. Le Presa is a bit dumpy. But the food is great tasting, cheap and in large portions.
