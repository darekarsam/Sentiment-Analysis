3	I disliked the old Domino's Pizza, but I actually really like the new Domino's Pizza with the better sauce, better cheese and garlic crust. Ordering is easy, coupons galore, delivery is usually under the time quoted. I ordered the Hot Hawaiian with ham, pineapple, jalapenos and hot sauce - so good and all the ingredients tasted very fresh.This is my local pizza joint until I move - so I order from them if I don't want to go out. I'll eat their pizza again!
5	This dominoes is awesome great customer service and friendly staff. My wife and I called at 9:45 to see when they closed for carry out they said ten then asked if we were close. I said yes they said chine on if it's after ten they would still let us come in.
