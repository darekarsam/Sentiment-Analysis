5	The movers were fantastic!  Very helpful, even asked us what items we wanted kept out since we had 5 days between packing and pickup.  Very careful with our items and very helpful all around!!!  The driver (Rob) made sure we were updated when it came to the drop off at our new home and he and his crew, (Glenn and Martin) even helped us arrange the rooms to our liking and made sure the furniture fit where we needed it to =)  Thank you so much for making what would normally be a very stressful experience a whole lot easier!
5	Been doing some work with this company for about a month now and I gotta say, they really are top notch.  When I have a bad experience I don't go back to a place, but when the experience is great, I give them feedback on Yelp, so here is your 5 stars !
1	Extremely awful experience with this company. We have moved 7 times and this is the first time we had things poorly packed, damage done to our items, AND items lost! Dents were put in the walls of our home when they were moving furniture and the response of the employees: "Opps, my bad". The foot was broke off our couch, then placed under the cushion and plastic wrapped! In addition my husbands tool box was damaged then duck taped back together. Really??  3 items were lost, dents were put in our washer and dryer and an excessive amount of dust and dirt was accumulated on most of our items. Secure temperature controled storage is what we were told; ya right. We have made numerous calls to them that all have gone un-returned or given the run around. Only thing to be done now is file claims with a 3rd party company, which to me doesn't resolve the disrespect done to our property by Southern Nevada Movers. Word of mouth is a powerful thing especially when you do this to a military family. Would mot recommend this company to my worst enemy!!!
