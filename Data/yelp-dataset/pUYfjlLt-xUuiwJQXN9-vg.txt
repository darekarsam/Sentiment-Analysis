5	I haven't been here since they remodeled.  It was beautiful and the service was very nice.
5	I never expected to write a review about a mortuary but when a group goes as above and beyond as they did you share.  We just got through the loss of a family member and my husband told us to "call Messinger"  I am so glad he did.  From the first call where David gave me so much info that I really didn't need much else.  Then our meeting with the director who was a lovely young lady Michelle.  She made everything so easy and was never once pushy, always respectful and it was just about what we needed.  They made sure to assure us along the way we were doing everything right and on the day of the services we just showed up.  At the end the two amazing men helped us get all of the flowers and other stuff in the car, even told us how to care for the flowers and even buckled my grandmother in the car!  That is service!  When I thanked them, they would simply respond that's what we are here for.  I would highly recommend them to anyone experiencing a loss or planning for your future, you will not be sorry.
5	My wife and I came down to Scottsdale for a Funeral at Messingers Mortuary.  The people were nice and I thought they did a good job of helping everybody.  Hopefully I don't have to go to another one of these for a long time.
