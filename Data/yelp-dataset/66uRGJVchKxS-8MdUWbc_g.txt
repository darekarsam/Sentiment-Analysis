1	Terrible food,  the rolled tacos are so hard you can't bite into them. The guacamole is NASTY! Taste like it's expired. I also ordered a shrimp cocktail but have not tried it yet and at this point I don't really wan to.
1	Why!!!! So disappointed. ..wanted good mexican food and the roll tacos are so nasty.  Super hard and cold! Isn't there anyone supervising how the food is cooked.
4	Very yummy been there twice now and have been happy with my orders.  I got the burrito de lengua the first time and the enchilada combo plate the second.  It's not a home made version but the restaurant version. It's pretty decent I would certainly go back to try the rest of the menu as well I gave it 4 stars instead of three because I'm extremely picky on the rice. If it does not taste good I won't even bother with the rest if the menu. This rice however was very good! Good texture good quality good flavor! I'm excited to try the rest if the dishes.
4	Good food,  big portions for the price.  Guacamole tasted fine. Closer to Mexican food than taco bell. I'd eat here again.  We had the super nachos and a chimichanga plate. They served more than we could eat.
3	We have eaten here 3 times and been satisfied each time.  As other posts they certainly serve a good portion of food.   The guacamole is not as nasty as a couple of posts indicated.  The super nachos are excellent and enough for 3 people to share.  The rolled tacos are what you would expect.  Meat in a rolled, fried shell and topped with shredded cheese and guacamole.  We have ordered both these items each time here and have enjoyed them.  The chicken burritos have a slight bite to them.  The carne asada is good.  The service is polite, but slow.  At times there is a language barrier depending on the employee.
1	This place started out good, but has gotten to be so salty that the food is inedible.
