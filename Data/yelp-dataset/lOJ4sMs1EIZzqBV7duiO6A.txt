4	Really good, reasonably priced pizza. I love Dominos since the change however long ago. Plus it is FAST!!!! When three kids are "Starving" its a great place to look. We had the new bread bites.. Well worth the $1.00. If you are comparing to premium pizza places it certainly does not compare but if you are looking for good food, at a good price, fast it is  a great place. Dominos delivers everything you expect from them.
1	After ordering pizza from this location at least 2-3 times per month using their on-line website, we decided to order tonight.   We've been good customers and tipped at least $5 per delivery.   I had a super busy day and just didn't feel up to cooking so  I ordered our pizza on line, as usual, and about fifteen minutes later I  received a phone call from a sympathetic clerk saying that she was sorry, we are no longer in their "delivery boundaries."   Way to reward loyal customers Domino's.   Luckily, I found out that we are within Pizza Hut's "boundaries" and their pizza was delivered within 30 minutes--cheaper and better.
1	Meant to make pizza last night but my dough didn't rise in time so decided to order one instead and this was the only place I could find that was open. Put in an online order for a couple pizzas and cheesy bread. It arrived pretty quick which was nice, but the only thing that wasn't awful was the cheesy bread. The pizzas were both extremely thin, greasy and worse than a $5 frozen pizza. Lesson learned.
