5	I don't really understand this place's function, but I was there on Thursday for a free event from the Cosmopolitan... a four course wine and food pairing.  How can you beat that?  Tried some wines, had some (tiny) portions of food, and got to socialize a little bit.  Cosmopolitan is easily my favorite hotel/casino right now, and this place is a great hidden jem!
