3	had a sicilian pizza that was good....but they put it on foil and it stuck on the foil and that was incredibly annoying....almost had foil for dinner....NO BUENO, MAN.
2	Poor guest service. If ur looking for service with an attitude this is ur spot. Won't be coming to this location again.
3	This is the token pizza option at the food court- choice of thin crust or pan crust, along with other options like salads, calzones, pastas, and... fried chicken? There's a sign advertising their special chicken, the only catch is it's $6/piece. Pretty absurd.Pan crust pizza comes in large slices for a normal price, ~$5.Also options to get a whole pie with two drinks or sides for $24, if you have a group.Nothing noteworthy about service except that this is one of the quicker lines here.
