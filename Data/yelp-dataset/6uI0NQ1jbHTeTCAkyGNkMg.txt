5	I recently embarked on an attempt to purchase or lease a 2009 Jetta. After visits to Centreville VW & Lauzon VW, I was convinced that my third trip to a dealer would be equally appalling. Happily, that could be no further from the truth.I walked into Popular VW on a rainy Wednesday afternoon and asked the receptionist to call a sales rep. I was soon introduced to Sebastien, who it turns out is the sales manager. Sebastien was patient, calm and completely transparent. He attempted to understand my needs and showed me a number of options.After two further visits, I agreed to lease a 2009 Jetta TDI. In the process, Sebastien answered all questions by phone and e-mail promptly and in a professional manner. When he delivered the vehicle, he took the time to ensure that I understood all its features and functionalities. And at the end of the day, I felt that I drove off with a fair deal.My suggestion to anyone in the market for a Volkswagen in Montreal is to pay a visit to Popular VW on St-Hubert. Your experience will be pleasant and hassle-free, which is far more than I can say for the comically horrible service rendered by the competition. And trust me, that's worth it. Because the car you buy is an expensive purchase. Expect a good experience from your dealer or walk out. And walk in to Popular Volkswagen.
