4	Fast in, fast out.  I rarely ever have to wait in line long.  They also have a Redbox outside.
2	Is it just me? Or, does it seem like bringing a gun to this Walgreens is getting more and more appropriate?
3	Pretty basic Walgreens wtih all of your essentials.  The one thing worth noting is that they do sell alcohol at this location.  I know not all locations do, so that's something to keep in mind.
4	I come to this Walgreens quite a bit and just recently, transferred my scripts here as well. The service is good and friendly. The store is well stocked with lots of variety. The pharmacy seems to open a few minutes later than posted hours but maybe it was a rare circumstance. Overall, a good, clean Walgreens.
5	Omg June at the make up counter is literally the sweetest lady ever! love her. Such a positive person and so helpful.
5	Great customer service! June in cosmetics is wonderful.  My wife goes to this store because of June's excellent customer service.
3	Hit or miss on level of service. Today, not so nice.  Other times pretty okay. Drive up is pretty quick, just don't expect a smile or thank you.
