3	I didn't buy anything here, but I did tag along with my coworker who is on the hunt for an engagement ring. This place is family owned and they will do anything and everything they can to help you out and get whatever it is you need.They have a decent selection of things with an emphasis on engagement rings and watches. If you're looking for helpful staff, or if you have a strict budget and hate Jared's/Kay's, I'd recommend coming here.
5	I have been here twice for two different reasons and both expreiences got 5 starts.Last Spring I sold about $400 in gold scrap and feel that I got a good price and good service.  Last month I went to get my wedding band fixed.  I got my finger slammed in a car door (thanks Jen!) and the ring got most of the damage.  A prong was bent and I had a smaller diamond missing from the band.  They matched and fixed everything and polished it to an amazing shine.  This place may not have the fancyness of mall or big box jewelry stores but the service you get is great and the prices are reasonable.  Enjoy!
5	I sent my Rolex President band to Sumpters for repining and refurbishment. They were in constant communication with me about the repairs, etc.  Ms. Carolyn McCoy was the person who kept in contact with me and she was great. I received the band today and it looked brand new.  It was in really bad shape when I sent it and I can't believe how good it looks now. Also, their cost was very fair.  I feel I truly got my money's worth. I wholeheartedly recommend them for any type of Jewelery service.  Bottom line, they tell you what they're  going to do and then they do it. .
