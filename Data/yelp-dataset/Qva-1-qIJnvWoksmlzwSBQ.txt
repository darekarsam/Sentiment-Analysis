1	Do not buy tickets from ticketnetwork! I bought tickets 4 months before a show and the tickets never showed up! Ticketnetwork told me there was nothing they could do to refund my money and I would need to contact the seller and my bank. AWFUL company!!
1	I got my tickets but the play was cancelled and they refused to refund.
1	DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE.  I spent $2500 for tickets to an NFL game on this website.  They were not listed as indoor seats but when they arrived they said indoors on the tickets and I found they were, in fact, inside.  This was not what I wanted.  I looked elsewhere on the internet and every other website I found listed them properly.  When I called to try to exchange or refund or resell they refused to be of any help and were incredibly dismissive.  I understand that this was at least partly my fault but it was the way I was treated that leads me to post this negative review.  After 3 phone calls and 45 minutes on hold they expressed zero interest in helping me and denied any culpability for the situation what-so-ever.  It was an unbelievably frustrating experience from a customer service perspective.
