2	Food court pizza, it is what it is. In this case, a very light and too fluffy crust that is 3/4 of an inch thick. The mushroom & spinach was probably the best choice.But it's a food court, so choices are limited.
3	This place only gets 3 stars for their amazing ziti... I've eaten here several times in all the years I been coming to this mall and while the staff has always been nice and courteous the pizza is bland and greasy as all get out and the salad has very poor lettuce If Italian is your thing there's a California pizza kitchen here that is much better quality food and after your charmin bill you'll encounter from the grocery store from villa it will come to the same price
