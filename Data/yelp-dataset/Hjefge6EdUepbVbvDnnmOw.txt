5	I was finally motivated to create a Yelp account after having the best haircut experience of my life this week and felt that I should give some good feedback.  I'm the kind of guy who, when the stylist/barber asks what we'll be doing with my hair today, suffers from gaping jaw, dilated pupils, sweaty palms, and uncontrollable fidgeting.  "How should I know?  YOU'RE the stylist," is typically my first thought.  I'm so glad I took a chance and walked in here.  Yao (spelling?), the owner and sole employee I believe, was fantastic.  For $15, I got more personal attention than I expected.  His haircut was slow and deliberate.  We had easy conversation.  And he helped me figure out what I could be doing with my normally unkempt mop of hair.  This is a great place if you're looking for a simple cut or cleanup, but it also seemed like he could do trendier, more complicated styling.  All in all, this was the best $15 I've spent in quite a while.
4	Owner/Hair stylist was attentive and very easy to talk with. Took me in within an hour's notice. Only $15 for a men's haircut, definitely a great deal. Will definitely return next time I am in town.
5	As an international student who moved to the US, it's difficult to trust people you don't know with your hair. I tried G because of the other good reviews, they were spot on! G is very good and he knows how to cut people with all kinds of hair. For $15 it's a great value!
5	I got a great haircut for a great price here. The conversation was better than at other shops too.
5	I always see Gao cutting men's hair, but just wanted to say that he does a great job with women's hair as well. I have short, thin hair which some stylists ruin, but Gao knows how to make this kind of hair look good in the style I want. Have been going to him for almost 2 years now and have never been disappointed.
5	I went to this place because of the good review on Yelp. I'm not disappointed! Hair and a bit of my beard for $20.
