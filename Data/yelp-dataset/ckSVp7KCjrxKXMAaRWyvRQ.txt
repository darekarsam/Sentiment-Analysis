5	What a fantastic experience to have been involved in!This still relatively new event is heavily helmed by the Downtown Project/Zappos and the Burning Man community, so there's a little bit of everything to be seen.  A good number of the floats are art cars that you would find from the Black Rock City event (which is basically a week long parade anyway), so there's lots of fire, lots of lights, lots of outrageous costumes, and lots of lively dance music.  Perfect for a parade!  There are also local community sponsors, such as the local SAG-AFTRA acting community, members of the Downtown Project, the Zombie Apocalypse Store and many others, so it's a huge, quirky collection of Bohemians, artists, and fun-loving folk out to have a good time, and make it into a show.With Downtown becoming more inhabited, the parade can only get better.  Once the parade ended, the Dancetronauts came out and kept the party going for the rest of the night.  It was a loud, colorful, and crazy experience, and long overdue to happen for the Las Vegas community.  I'm very grateful to see events like this come to the city and Downtown, and hope this becomes the standard, rather than the exception.I'm already looking forward to next year....
