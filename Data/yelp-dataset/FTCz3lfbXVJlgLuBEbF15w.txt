5	These are my go to guys for all things auto: fair, upfront, and consistent.
1	I used to come here a lot when I lived in the area because I clearly didn't know any better. Half of the time when I had a minor problem, everything was fine and work was quick and easy. When it was something more than an oil change, it was a disaster. The last time I went, which I made the absolute LAST time, they couldn't figure out why my fan wasn't kicking on and literally told me it would take NASA to figure it out. Real professional, guys. Which is hilarious, because I took it elsewhere 2 days later and it was fixed in 4 days, only because the part had to be shipped from overseas. I also recall a time where one of their grease monkeys walked me under my car and pointed out something to do with my brakes, so I scheduled an appt to handle whatever it was he was talking about and was told there was absolutely nothing wrong and they didn't know what I was referring to.  I could never decide if they were just lazy, uneducated in their craft or thought I was an easy target because I'm a woman, but this place is a joke.The employees also use their only loaner car as a personal everyday driver. Proof of this was the amount of paperwork and briefcases left in the backseat, and when I brought it to their attention that the previous customer might have left personal belongings behind, one of the guys just chuckled and said it was his stuff. Very unprofessional.
5	When I called to make an appointment I spoke with Mark who was more than helpful. Quoted me great prices for my brakes and oil change. Even offered coupons! Which was great because I was on a tight budget. I came in the next day, everyone was very friendly, great customer service! It was a little more than I expected to pay but only $30 more. Very clean Lobby with direct TV, and free WiFi. I would definitely recommend this place
