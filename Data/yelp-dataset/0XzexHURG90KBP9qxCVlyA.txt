5	A bit out of my price range...but I love coming here to look and get ideas.
3	While I am a fan of the chain itself, this location and I haven't quite seen eye to eye on some things. For example, what is 'new' and what is 'used/floor model'. In my opinion if something is out of the box, full of dust and glitter and has possibly been tested by customers, it's used and you should give at least 10% off if you don't have a new one to sell. Their opinion; if it's not broken it's new, even if no box exists any longer and it has to be beaten and cleaned...... Also, their computer search skills leave something wanting. I was looking for 3 items, they had only 1 and after doing a computer search told me that no store had 3. When I looked it up myself I found that a store very close by had 4. I called them, they reserved 3 for me and I picked them up that day. Moving on! lolThe staff is pleasant enough, the location is small but chalk full of great stuff :)
