4	This place was priced very well.  I would rate the massage average, as the pressure was not deep pressure as requested, but it was very relaxing and I felt good afterwards.  Therapists were very friendly and the ambience was great.  They used some great aromatherapy techniques.
5	Thank you for creating such a relaxing environment. The whole staff was so friendly and helpful and the massage was just wonderful. When I come back to Montreal, I will definitely be back here. Thank you so much.
