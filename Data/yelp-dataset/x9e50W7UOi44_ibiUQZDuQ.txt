4	FIRST!Reasons why I love going to this Lowe's:- Proximity to my house.- Cleanliness.- Helpful and easily accessible staff.- Store layout... easy to find everything if you've been here more than once.
3	This is a pretty nice Lowe's Foods store.  It was the first Lowe's I ever shopped at back when they first opened at this location (which was maybe around 8 to 10 years ago?)   In any case, they offer a pretty good variety of bakery items, deli foods, produce, etc. However, for me, when I shop at Lowe's, I still end up spending as much $$$ as I do at HT (or in some cases even more) for the stuff that I typically buy.  They have a  smaller selection of Organic/All Natural items, and while the ones that they offer are pretty good, they are not priced as competively as their "conventional" items.
