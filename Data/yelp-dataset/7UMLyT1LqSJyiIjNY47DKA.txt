4	This is a neighborhood park.  It's truly a neighborhood park because there is no parking anywhere at the park or within a mile or so of the park.  It can only be gotten to by walking from one of the neighborhoods nearby or riding a bike like I've done several times.  The neighborhoods nearby are all gated communities on the TCP courses so it's unlikely you can park in one of them.The walkway is only 8/10 of a mile but it is lined with benches, has wonderful desert landscaping, and from the park you have a good view of the city in the distance.  Every 1/10 of a mile on the paved trail, there's a section of smooth concrete with added animal foot prints.  This  is a way of knowing how far or how fast you're walking the trail.I'm not sure if there are plans to ever put a parking area here, but eventually, this trail is supposed to connect with the Angel Park Trail and then it would be available to more people.  Until such time, live nearby, walk a fair distance, or get on your bike and ride!  It's a pretty place.

Unlikely to replace Cottonwood Canyon or the treadmill in my HOA-owned gym but certainly a place I'll revisit from time to time it never ceases to amaze me just how many tiny community parks are so close to my home.
