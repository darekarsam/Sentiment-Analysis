4	Location: Right smack in the middle of Atwater market. They have a very tiny kiosk but it's easy to spot.Service: Great - the clerk talked to me about the different flavours they have and suggested I try the 9-piece box since I was a first timer. Chocolate: Love it! Each flavour is unique and incredibly delicious. It's tough to pick a favourite but I have a crush on the Gianduja - it's unlike any other version of this flavour that I've had at other chocolatiers. G-B make delicious chocolate using quality ingredients and zero preservatives and as a result, you have to eat your stash within 7-10 days of purchase. Yeah,right.... Like it'll last that long in my house. I don't think so!Check it!
3	Like the previous reviewer stated; it's hard to miss this charming kiosk. All the chocolates are presented so beautifully that no chocoholic can resist! I opted for the small tin of 4 which equaled a whopping $9 CA, ouch!! Don't get me wrong it was good chocolate, and I understand the complexity and unique flavor profiles they had going but for some reason it wasn't something that made me say: "Wow, that's amazing!" which for $9 I was expecting it to send me floating out of Atwater in chocolate bliss; it just didn't happen. Service was good, definitely at least give it a try though, but personally it's not something I'd go out of my way for in the future.
