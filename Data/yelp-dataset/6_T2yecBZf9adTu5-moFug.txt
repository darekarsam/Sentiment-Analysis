3	Nice place to grab a quick meal or watch a sporting event.  About 10 TV's in the bar area.  Had the soft taco special, that was good pub grub.  Service was very good and very friendly.
5	This is our go-to place for good food and great sports viewing.  Not sure who previous reviewer is talking about but the owner is a man and he seems to be a decent guy.  Families are welcome, especially in the large dining room which also has a number of tv's including one at every booth ( kids watch cartoons while adults watch the game).   Bar area is great for watching multiple games with nice new hd tvs.
1	Service seemed quite good but the meatball sandwich I ordered seemed to be lacking enough meatballs at least one-forth of the bun was empty lengthwise and the meatballs were small. They should either put on more meatballs of adequate size or serve it on a bun half the size.
3	This a great little place to watch a game or catch up with a few friends without being drowned out by music or cigarette smoke. The drink specials are good but fairly typical of any neighborhood bar.  Standard bar food, but still good.  I'll continue to go until my friends move out of the surrounding complex.
5	Wings are made to order! Crispy & juicy.  Small town bar feel! Very friendly staff & patrons.  Gray place to watch a game and throw back some drafts!
5	My mother in law rants and raves about this place, so during one of my trips to the Burgh, she took us there.  She was not kidding, those wings, oh my.  They were really crispy yet juicy and the fried pickles...some of the best fried pickles i've ever had.  the server was really nice and asked us if we wanted to be in the dining area or near the bar instead of assuming...nice job!I am thinking about those wings right now, dang I wish i had some.
