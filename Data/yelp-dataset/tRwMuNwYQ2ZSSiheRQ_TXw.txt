2	Most gentlemen will know this isn't their club of choice.  Even T-Pain (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_WvBJugHN0) would take issue with this Montreal mainstay.  To each his or her own, but I'm all for anything but this joint.They have a lot of hustler like promoters out on the street trying to get people to visit.  Shady men who were likely auctioneers in a past life, will be on the street telling groups of dudes they can make them "VIP" if they agree to a cover charge that is subject to debate.  A bachelor party I was a part of wanted no part in this deal, it was already a turn off from the start.But fast forward a trip or two later and it's co-ed party and we're looking to try something new.  LGC wasn't charging a cover and the hustler was no where to be found, so we took a leap of faith.  The girls were dated, the staff felt like mafia, and to suggest the place was anything besides super ghetto would be absurd.  Though the drink prices were solid, the ambiance was definitely not.  A short time into the place and we couldn't stomach another minute.  With Montreal being such a haven for adult entertainment, it's more than a buzzkill to patron this place when there are so many better alternatives.
2	FYI: Gentlemen's Choice has recently changed it's name to Bar Le Grand Prix. (see picture)Here's my reasoning for only 2 stars... It's the same exact club as it's next door neighbor Club Downtown, but the staff (both dancers & non-dancer) are just flat out rude.  Plus you can't walk past a single person in this place without being forced to drop $2 in their hand.  Which becomes annoying & excessive very quick.The "barkers" on the street were in full force as usual.  They've never honestly bothered me, most of them are usually pretty amusing, and if you stop to talk to them for a few minutes you'll find out some of them are decent guys to know for nightlife activities.So we go upstairs to the club... Standard $5 cover, if you decide to check your coat it's a toonie in the bucket also, then the "doorman" has his hand out for $2, he then points you to the guy that will "take you to your seat"... The place isn't that big that I couldn't find a seat on my own, just saying.  I told the guy that we wanted to sit at the stage (where there was plenty of open seats) but I guess he must not have heard me, because we were brought to the table that was as far away from the stage as you could get... and of course he holds his hand out for his $2.  After settling in the surly waitress takes our drink order and we're finally able to begin our night.Most of the dancers we came across were, not only "all business," but also very pushy about it...  I prefer the ones that will hang out for a few, chat, "commit to the role" if you will.  But I also don't hold it against them if they're strictly business.  My problem is when I say no to a dance and the girl starts in on me for refusing.  I do my best to try and not be rude, but sometimes I felt like, "How many ways can I tell this girl NO?"My opinion, go next door to Club Downtown...  The staff has better personalities, the dancers are better looking (and not nearly as pushy), you won't run into as many random people forcing a tip out of you, and even their barkers easier to deal with.
5	Came here to Club Grand Prix after visiting Club Downtown next door. I guess they changed their name recently? I went up a similar flight of stairs, paid a similar $5, passed through a similar turnstyle, and was lead past a not quite so gigantic bouncer by a host.  The dancers here are also quite hot. They dance, they get nekked. Pretty much very similar experience to next door.  The only difference I noted was that the private dances are $10 or $20. (The $20 is just a bit dirtier than $10)                                                              But ya, still quite fun.
