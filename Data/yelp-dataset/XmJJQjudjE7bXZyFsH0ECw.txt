1	This was a frightening experience. I never would have pulled in but I needed gas and the BP across the steel which was my intended destination was completely out of order. This stations pumps are so old you have to flick the little lever up to turn them on. On top of this there are only 4 of them which makes navigating around hard. To top it all off the card reader wouldnt take my card. No big deal. I go inside and pay. I'm told to go outside and hit the pay inside button and that the worker would let me pump it up. I go to do so and can't get the button to work. A worker comes out to try, then he hits it and another button simultaneously then he bangs on it a few times and finally makes me go to another pump (remember how close together these 4 pumps are...). Will never return here.
3	This gas station could use a major face lift. It's looks exactly how I remember it looked almost 15 years ago.  The entire the store is cramped but it's place to buy cigarette.
