5	The most AUTHENTIC Lebanese restaurant in Montreal! The family that runs the place is very accommodating and friendly.The food is amazing and fresh. Another thing that was outstanding was the service. Keep up the good work!
3	Howdy!Nice, solid Lebanese food. Large portions, reasonably priced. Unfortunately stuck in a horribly inconvenient location if you are car-less. On the other hand, if you live in ville Saint Laurent this should be your go to place for Baba ghanoush and grilled meats.
5	Amazing authentic Lebanese food and great service. It is a tragedy that more people don't know about this place. Please go eat there you won't be disappointed. Try the seafood platter and the fatouche salad!
