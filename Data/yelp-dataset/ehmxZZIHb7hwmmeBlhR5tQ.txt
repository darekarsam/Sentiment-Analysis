3	If this is a golf club, I'm the abominable snowman.  Looks like a pleasant place, but there sure as heck aren't any *golf* holes getting balled here.
4	As Lee mentioned this is NOT a real golf club - but this place is actually really cool so don't let the poor review deter you! It's too bad they aren't open to the public (you have to know a member to dine there) because it really is quite a little gem.Where else can you see Babe Ruth's underwear, Drink OMB Copper, and see an original Gypsy Rose costume? The place is basically a menagerie of quirky conversation starters. It certainly has a "hee-man woman haters club"-esque feel as evident by the nude women paintings and sports paraphernalia.  I had a work function there yesterday and was able to choose between two beers (OMB Copper/ and something Gaelic) as well as a selection of wine. Both beers were terrific and the bartender was just top notch! We had a buffet set up that consisted of delicious plump yummy cheese-burgers, bbq chicken,hot dogs (didnt try) fresh cut fries that were perfect, and tasty coleslaw. They had malt vinegar for the fries and I literally could have eaten a pound of those. All the food was piping hot and super fresh. It wasn't the healthiest but considering the atmosphere it really had an all-American feel. Dessert was hand delivered to everyone by a very friendly server. The most creamy vanilla bean ice cream ever topping a perfect apple crisp meets bread pudding dish. I ate the entire thing even though I was very full.5 stars for service, food, and atmosphere -1 star because it isn't open to the public.If you know a member you should check this place out!
5	Really a unique place, lots of celeb's on the wall. Try the painter's steak!
