4	Look, you don't come here for frills. It's basic pizza by the slice. But it's also cheap, big, and tastes surprisingly good - there's no grease dripping off your hands or questionable toppings. And a few days a week, they'll even scoop a handful of fries on top in case you need that extra calorie boost. Cheap, good pizza. What's not to like?
1	My first night in Montreal and this is one of the few late night food spots we could find. The food was decent but, the pricing was a little outrageous.  Buyer beware please be prepared with Canadian currency the will just create a price for you to pay.  As I am now on my second day here I realized that I was scammed out of an extra $5! Is living that hard that we need to rip off visiting out of towners? Im giving one star because the food was decent everything else was highly disappointing.
3	It's nearing 4am and I'm drunk and hungry. Well imagine my delight when the lights to this quaint little pizza shop were glowing when returning to our hotel next door.We crushed a few slices of various types of pizza. There was nothing really remarkable about the pizza, but it was reasonably tasty for a reasonable price. A solid 3 star slice, and even at this ridiculous hour it was actually the namesake of the store, Dany, working the til. A kudos to that kind of commitment to serving the za.This place is indeed, A-OK.
