4	This is our store.  Been going here for 20 years throug it's many incarnations. Close enough for a quick run as well as a long marathon trip.  Laid out well and the staff is friendly and helpful.  Store is clean and the prices are good too.
4	I love this location-great selection of food, of course, but also, since it's a marketplace, there is a huge selection of toys and games, which is very handy at times. Their "home" section has pretty stuff, but it's also pretty expensive, so I try not to buy there-though I have purchased a couple of wedding gifts.No Fry's, anywhere, has a decent pharmacy. That's a corporate problem, not a store issue. I've tried Fry's pharmacies and have had nothing but trouble. Totally not worth the aggravation.The produce section here is crazy good. They even have some bulk items. Produce is usually very fresh and tasty. Lots of those little plastic bags available, and the place is always clean.I like their wine and spirits section, here, too. Very open and easy to find what you want.They could definitely improve their cart situation. When carts are available, they're pretty far from the door, and there are usually a bunch of people (sometimes Fry's employees) smoking between the store and the carts. I'm truly sorry that smokers get picked on so much - I have a weight problem so I know what being ostracized is like, but seriously, I don't like walking through smoke to get my cart. Other than that...The staff here is very friendly and helpful. Parking is plentiful, there's a Fry's gas station with awesome prices most of the time. I love shopping here for the most part!
