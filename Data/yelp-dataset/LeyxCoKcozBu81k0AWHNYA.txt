3	when i went to this improv i wasn't really sure what to expect, we went to the ten o'clock show and dispite there not being a big turn out of people in audence, the performers did a good job and made it entertaining. It would have been better if they sold beer there
5	I've gone to two Atlas Improv shows (both times, the 8pm Theatresports show). It's such a fun place to go with friends, family, or a date-- plenty of laughs, and a very talented group. Highly recommended!
5	Fantastic improvisational comedy. I usually go to the 8PM show on Friday or Saturday for more fast-paced improv games. The 10PM shows are great, too. They don't serve alcohol, but the restaurant next door does, and there is a connecting door, so you can bring your drink in!
4	Discovered Atlas through the visitmadison website and decided this could be a fun act to check out. I've been to improv sports before where different 'teams' get up and do a variety of bits while competing against each other. My partner and I showed up about 10 minutes prior to the 8pm show and were able to get in right away... we were the first there. Hesitantly, we waited for others to show. A total of 11 people in a venue that looked to fit 70. We were shocked! Perhaps because it was summer and not many students at the UW were around. Or perhaps because it was the 8pm show and others planned to make their way later in the evening.In general, I really enjoyed the show. Many of the other sport improv groups I've seen rely on crude humor. That wasn't Atlas' style. They're creative and certainly have a lot of fun with their work. For performing for such a small group, I was really impressed!The venue was extremely warm and I wonder if that was accidental. Did someone forget to turn on the AC? I'd recommend this for an inexpensive night out!
