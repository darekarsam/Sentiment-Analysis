4	Just received our first veggie basket of our season. We decided to go with the 30$ pay as you go subscription. We received a good selection of Tomatoes, a pepper, Garlic Scapes, fresh Garlic, young sweet Corn, and the biggest Zucchini I have ever seen. I am very pleased with our beautiful vegetables, as I am proud to be supporting local farmers, ad feel that I defiantly got our 30$ worth. Thanks Lufa
4	Lufa baskets are an interesting concept, part CSA and part grocery delivery, they merge the best of both. And as a city dweller, apart from the few herbs, tomatoes and peppers I grow on my balcony, its hard to get more local than the produce Lufa grows in their rooftop greenhouses. Although I belong to a traditional CSA, I also subscribe to Lufa so that I don't have to go without local produce during the months when nothing grows outside. Their pay as you go format, along with being able to indicate multiple "vacation" weeks means I can choose when to get a basket. On top of that, you get to customise the individual items. Something else great about Lufa is that they have a lot of drop off points, with reasonable pick up times.Overall Lufa is an excellent service and Montrealers are lucky to be able to take advantage.
