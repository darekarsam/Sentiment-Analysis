5	This place is not topnoch, but the food is Amazing. They have the best birria in town.  Clean place and good service. Be ready to order. You order your birria by pound or half pound.
5	This place is a traditional real Mexican establishment. They only have one item in the menu, birria, but it is probably the best in town. Yes, they don't give you chips and beans but seriously, you can get those anywhere else, if you are here you should only eat the birria. They sell it by the pound but you can also get half a pound. They give fresh made tortillas so you can make your own tacos with as much or little meat as you desire. They also bring you cilantro, onion and salsa to top your tacos. One pound is enough for two people (given that when I'm here I can eat up to 8 tacos!!) but it could easy feed three or four. Don't forget to ask for a "consome" (the broth where the goat is cook) with garbanzo beans and a cup of Mexican coffee!! (It's delicious and it has cinnamon in it). Otherwise you can get Mexican soda, lemonade, horchata or Jamaica (hibiscus water). The price is good for the portion size you get. The service is attentive. The place is cozy.
