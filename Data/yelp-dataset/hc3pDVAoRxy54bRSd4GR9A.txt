5	I love this place!  It's the kind of place that will make you want to redecorate your entire life.  From local hand made jewelry to purses, wall decor, baby things, and things you never knew you wanted but really really need and can't leave without!  Perfect example- there was a cool collection of yard sticks in different colors... don't need one but had to have it!!
5	This store is super cute and has an overwhelming amount of inventory to look at.  I couldn't find enough time to shop and look at everything this place has to offer.  My friend and I found so many things we liked we couldn't decide what things to buy and which to leave behind. This store carries a variety of clothing, cute purchases and jewelry and a lot of other hard to resist items.  The store is also set up really nicely and displayed their items well.  Some things are overpriced so you really have to carefully choose your purchases, but everything is so adorable it's sometimes worth overpaying.
5	I have been shopping At Cottage Garden I and II for years. Carol the owner is knowledgeable about what looks good in a home, she has seasonal items, gifts, clothes that you will find no where else, jewelry and items to decorate your home. Great store, I love that it is locally owners and not another shop like it.
5	Carol and her employees are darling. I like to stop in with my mom sometimes, and they always remember us. I love that! Not only is the service wonderful, but there are soooo many wonderful treasures... Clothing and jewelry alike!
