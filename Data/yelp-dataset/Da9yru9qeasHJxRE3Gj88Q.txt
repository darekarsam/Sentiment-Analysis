5	They have great selection and good service.
4	Cool furnishing store with modern designs. You'll find a lot of unique items, whether it's a bed, coffee table, or decorative item. Prices are fair, since you are paying a little more for the unique aspect, plus the higher quality.
1	In April, I ordered, and completely paid for two chairs. I was told it would be six weeks. As that time neared, I called and left a message for my saleswoman who never bothered to return my phone call. Another saleswoman said she would help. Another week passed with no information. I again called and was told that my chairs were due to be completed by July 4th. Again, as that time passed I called and was informed it would be the end of a July. Another two weeks without a call. I called again and was told it would one be the first week of August. Ok, so now it's August 5th, and I (the customer) call for a follow-up. A gentleman answers the phone and said it's now going to be Mid -August. He said he will call me this Friday. - we will see.  I have a few thoughts - shouldn't my saleswoman be following up with me?  Isn't it common courtesy to notify customers of delays??I'm pretty sure that if I hadn't called and asked, Thingz would be complacently happy to keep my money and never deliver!  I just got a note from my interior design professionals suggesting we go look at Thingz for a table. No thank you!!!
