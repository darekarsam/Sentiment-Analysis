4	Right down the street from my house so I always go and pick up my pizza. Pizza is always ready when they say it will be,  piping hot. Cashiers are always upbeat and friendly.  Right now Mon-Thursday you can get a large 3 topping for $7.99. I used to hate Domino's but since they have changed their recipes I have become a fan. Their pan pizza is my go to for pizza style. They also do a decent Brooklyn style pizza, but being from NY/NJ there's no comparison to the real thing!
5	Everything is fresh and hot, delivery is pretty fast. They are always courteous  and friendly, love the online ordering, simple and fast.
1	Worst service possible. You would think delivering a low chain pizza would be the easiest job in the world, but apparently it takes a rocket scientist. Management didn't help. I don't know if I just ordered on a bad night, so I might give him a second chance with future, but I don't see much hope for improvement if it was this bad.
