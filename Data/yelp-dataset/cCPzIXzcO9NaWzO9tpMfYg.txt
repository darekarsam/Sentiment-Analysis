2	Bland food, service is ok.   If you want to go to a restaurantBland, bland and more bland.   Nolhing exciting here,  just a formula chain eatery.
1	The food is bland and the service is slow. I went there a few times but I won't go there any more.It's also not kids friendly. They won't let you use their microwave to heat baby food. I had to drive 2km to the nearest McDonald's to heat my child's food in the microwave because the manager of the restaurant won't let me use their microwave!
1	Went here for breakfast.  The food is ok, but the service was terrible.  Granted, I don't speak much French, but I think that shouldn't completely change the attitude of the waiter.  Anyway, the entire time, we had to ask for refills of water and coffee.  Basic functions.  It wasn't even that packed.To top it off, the waiter took 20 minutes to get my check.  I asked several times and he told me to wait.  When I complained to the manager, he finally got my check, and claimed that I had only been waiting for 5 minutes.  The manager sided with him and basically called me a liar. lol what?Yeah, I'm not going here next time I visit.
2	Dropped by for a coffee and BLT with a colleague from work.  Service was good, food was OK, typical east side Mario's food, decent value for what you get.
2	I almost feel bad for the waiters. The service was good, relatively speaking. I ordered the '16 layer lasagna' at 18.99$, apparently a signature dish. It was bland, the meat was rubbery, and the center of the lasagna was still cold. Definitely won't be coming back. Two stars for the waiters' effort
