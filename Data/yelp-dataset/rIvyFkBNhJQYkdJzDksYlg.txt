4	I love how it's a cafe and an Asian restaurant in one. We happen to have a Buy 1 Get 1 Pho FREE. I ordered the pho with no meat (only because it was lent and I was unable to eat meat).  It took some time for the server to bring us our food.A small pho was pretty big! It was tasty. But if you want the extra condiments, like the hoisin, sriracha, and fish sauce you need to flag down a Asian server because the other servers wouldn't know what those condiments are. Overall if you happen to stay at the Palms and crave for some pho. Fortunes is the place to be.
4	We usually come here for family style Chinese food. It's nice that it's connected to the cafe too because the kids like to order their favorite prime rib & lasagna. The service was good. The gentleman that served us was Vietnamese as well so was able to give us good advice on what he recommends and doesn't.Fish Ma Soup - Good ..A little bland but nothing a little salt and pepper couldn't fix lolHoney walnut shrimp - good size portion n tastySalt n pepper shrimp - I love it with extra extra garlicBeef chow fun - goodSalted fish fried rice - goodOxtail Hotpot - goodWhole steamed flounder - craving satisfiedPeking duck - made correctly unlike Coronado Cafe in South pointPrime rib - perfectly rare the way I like it
3	2 1/2 starsI've been here 2x, one at morning one at night. The service during late night is ridiculously slow. It took forever to get out food. Though the waitress was nice. The service in the morning time was better, average.I ordered the egg white omelet which wasn't very good. There wasn't much substance in the omelet. On the plus side, comes with a side of fruit.The next morning I came for the skillet scramble. I specified to put extra veggies and add avocado. Awesome thing is that they really let you customize your order (with additional charge for certain things). Also, it is open 24 hours!
