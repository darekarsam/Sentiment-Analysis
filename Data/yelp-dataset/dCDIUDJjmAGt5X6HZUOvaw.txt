2	I LOVE south point family practice with only one exception: Dr. Caroline Stephens is HORRIBLE! Three times now she has denied my medication refill that I have been on for years without even looking over my chart, asking my doctor, or calling me. She is callous and apparently does not read medical charts, nor does she care too. Do not use this doctor!!
2	I have thought about writing this review for a while and have finally decided to get out. I have been with this practice for over three years now and the service has consistently declined. Within the past year the time it takes to even make appointments has increased to 15min of waiting on hold just to then have them tell you that they don't have any appointment times open that will suit your schedule for at least two weeks. I have not seen the same physician each time I have visited in the past year and only one time have I received courteous service. If you want to be able to see the doctor in a timely manner and have the staff at least seem like they care about you consistently, then South Point Family Practice is not the place for you.
4	I've been seeing doctors with this practice since I was a kid.  Over the last 6+ years Dr. Stephens has been my primary doctor and I highly recommend her; now my 5 year old daughter and my mother are seeing her also.  Not only is she professional and thorough, she has a great bedside manner which many doctors seem to lack.  I have never had an issue getting a quick appointment with her unless scheduling a physical--and that is my only complaint.  Because they only schedule physicals a few times a day I had to schedule my last physical with her 6 months in advance.  Sometimes I think maybe the practice has taken on too many patients.  But overall I highly recommend South Point Family Practice.  They have great staff and nice facilities, and the urgent care night and weekend hours are very convenient.
