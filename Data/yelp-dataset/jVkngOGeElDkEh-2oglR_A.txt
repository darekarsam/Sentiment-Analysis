4	Excellent menu!
5	If you're from the U.S., the concept of Rotisseries Scores will make you expect a typical "casual dining" style restaurant (like O'Charley's or Chili's, etc). And, I guess, for Quebec, that's what this is. Except, it's Quebec, and their casual dining quality is better than most fine dining restaurants in the U.S. The chicken is flavorful, and not at all dry, the salad bar (a terror-inducing term in the states) is a mountainous area of fresh vegetables and fresh fruits. Yes, there are plenty of amazingly good fine dining restaurants in Quebec, but to really appreciate the higher standard of Canadian food, visit a chain like Rotisseries Scores, and you'll weep next time you see an Applebee's in the U.S.
3	Scores is growing rotisserie chain that I seldom visited over the course of the last few years. I go there for my favorite meal, the chicken and bacon focaccia and in the past it was served on a very fresh, huge ciabatta bread and now it has changed to a more.... economical style bread in both quality and size. What can one expect in Laval, land of the chain restaurants?However, their side orders beyond the average fries and excellent onion rings are pretty terrible. The rice lacks flavor, the vegetables (if you call them that) are stale, taste like processed food and are probably are less healthy than the fries.They have a salad bar for a few bucks more but I never bothered. Why eat salad at a Rotisserie? :PThe Pouding chomeur 'a la mode' is out of this world and a personal favorite as well.Service is generally solid and you get taken care of. Refills are never a problem. The price tag is reasonable with a lot of options available during their lunches that don't hit your wallet too much.All in all, if you stick at the stuff that are tried and true it's a decent enough place to eat at.
