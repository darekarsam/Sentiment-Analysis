5	This company was recommended to me by a a friend and I've been using their service for may years now and never had bug problems, they are very reliable and knowledgeable about bugs in the area and how to control them. The staff is friendly and professional, they stop once a month to spray and to make sure no insect moves into my house, is always better to prevent than to deal with an infestation.  If you have problems with uninvited guests, this are the guys to call, and no, I didn't mean mother in laws!
5	Sudden Impact is keeping our lives in control. Have gotten rid of all the nasty bugs. Were recomended by a friend who we trust. Good company!
5	I have been using Sudden Impact Pest Control since 1986 and I would not consider using any other pest control company.  They are fast, efficient, reliable and very considerate of your needs. If you want the best in town, call Sudden Impact!
2	While for the most part they have done a good job, I have experienced much better in my last condo. I had a problem with bees and called the management company. Sudden Impact Pest control came out and they plugged the hole they found in the building. They do not have the ability to go in and get out the hive or even see if there is one in the wall. Plugging the hole drove more bees into my place causing me to leave. Bee masters came to the rescue and fixed the problem properly. Sudden impact did not reimburse me for my hotel and ignored all of my letters to them. They should not have plugged the hole. After this I saw an increase in bug activity until I complained to the management company. Since then most bug activity decreased, but earwigs or pincher bugs increased. If I was in charge I would fire them.
