3	Its the same as any other Burger king. Not a fan of the California Burger or maybe they didn't make it right. The guacamole was way to salty. No need to mess with guac leave it alone BK.
3	The Manager was nice. The WHOPPERS I had fresher than usual. However very poor cost value ratio. The food is overpriced for what you get.
4	Girl who took my order which was surprisingly happy with her voice. Love seeing happy nice people.Was busy when I went hot food
