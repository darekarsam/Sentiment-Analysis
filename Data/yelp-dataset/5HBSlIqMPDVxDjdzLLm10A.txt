5	A Great Store with plenty of Inventory and Advise
5	Visited Obie's Trains today and met Fred the owner.  He provided great "old time service".  He fixed a coupler problem I was having and only charged me for the part while he installed the part.  Outstanding inventory available at competitive prices.  Many unique items in the inventory.
5	I was at Obies Trains that day of the unhappy customer incident..It was Christmas Eve and the store was very busy.Those guys interrupted Obie in the middle a customer transaction.There wasn't any 'glance at this list'. The $50 part was a piece they needed for a tricky reversing loop. Who would walk into any store on Christmas Eve and demand special needs help?Complex track plans are very time consuming to figure out. Obie suggested a simpler track plan. He would have fixed them up immediately. Bottom line is those guys didn't have their list together.Rest assured that Obie is extremely Customer Service oriented.He does everything possible to do what it takes for customers.Unfortunate, that a single individual will try and unfairly give a poor rating.I highly recommend Obies Trains. Shop there with confidence! I do not recommend Yelp as it censors reviews. Where is Freedom of Speech?Let the people decide what reviews they consider!
5	You can now find many cool items at Obies Trains. I see a lot of new productsand some 2nd hand items at real good prices. A great place to get startedwith your Hobby. I highly suggest a visit to see this hobby shop.
