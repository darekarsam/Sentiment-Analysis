5	My favorite gym! The atmosphere is spa like, which is a nice place to be after work.  I just love all their classes... they have so many and at convenient times.  My favorites are the Body Pump classes. The staff is very friendly and helpful.
3	went in as a guest of a friend of mine who is a member there... nice atmosphere.  LOT of oldddd folks and they seem to market themselves as "Silver Fitness" sort of fitness center... (this may be a turn-off for some younger people.)they had a lot of machines and exercise gear ... 2 pools and tan beds/etc /etc.  i'd probably prefer personally to work out somewhere with a younger crowd.
2	This is not a review on this gym. It is a review on their customer/membership service. I just called there. All I wanted to know is what their monthly fees were. Simple right? Wrong. They want your name and phone number and the rights to your first born child and then they won't even tell you anything without you physically coming to them to "talk" about what's best for you. I took psychology classes, I know what they are trying to do by talking to you face to face. I am sorry, but I want a gym, not a drug dealer. I don't need you to try to shove your products down my throat, I want to go somewhere to work out and be left alone. (That's why I wear headphones and don't make eye contact). I just wish places like this would give you a straight answer about their membership fees without hassling you. I won't go here now, period, because I don't believe in these kind of tactics. Just be straight with people, is that so hard?
4	I'm a gym guy. I go 3 or 4 times a week among other workouts and activities. ProsAlways towelsVery cleanAlways cardio equipment openPools/hot tubLots of lockersFriendly staffLots of classesLots of free wightsNext to target and trader joesEven during peek hours it's never over crowdedConsWhen the old lady's come in they take up all the parking spots some how. But that's not the gyms faultOnly one flat bench pressSince they have pools and a kids activities some times kids wonder into the wight areasSo in the end more pros then cons.This is more just nit picking but as all gyms have them. There are a few weirdos who are members and just take up space more then workout but oh well what can ya do about it.
4	Great club.  Extremely clean.  Never really crowded.  Machines are modern and up to date and well Maintained. Staff is on it.  Young energetic trainers and staff.
