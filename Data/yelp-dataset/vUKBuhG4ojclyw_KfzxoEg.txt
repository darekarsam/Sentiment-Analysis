5	Wonderful place to get you car fixed. I highly recommend it. Matt is great!!! He always takes care of my car in a fast and fair manner. He will call me with the diagnosis then I tell him whether to continue or not. He explains to me clearly what the problem is and how much it will cost to fix it. This is the best place in town to get your car repaired.
5	These guys know cars. Friendly, efficient, and willing to go the extra mile to accommodate personal needs in my case. Fixed my brakes, rotated and aligned tires, and changed my oil. Definitely the type of shop you want to have working on your vehicle, and I would absolutely go back.
