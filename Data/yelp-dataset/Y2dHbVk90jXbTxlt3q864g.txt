5	My family stayed here on 4-13-13 and the whole experience was great. Marlene at the front desk was very nice and helpful, she made our check in quick and easy. Our room was very clean and the mattress was real comfortable. They have a onsite lounge that also serves food, the locals made the lounge a fun experience with them singing kareoke, we had a great time in the lounge. All in all, i highly recomend this hotel.
5	It is located right in the Best Western Gold Canyon Inn & Suites of AZ., you could really go anywhere easily, lobby is decent and spacious, helpful receptionists and efficient service, room was neat and clean, we didn't have breakfast here cause it was not included in the excellent package we bought, we stayed 4 nights here happily.
4	very nice and new, very spacious rooms with double beds, satellite TV, very clean. located in the center (between the skyscrapers of the financial district. Paid Internet and dear, free only in the lobby. Ditto for car parking, about thirty dollars a day, but in front there is parking very cheap. hotel quiet
