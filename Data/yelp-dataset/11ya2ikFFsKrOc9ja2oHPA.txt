5	Nice clean office, friendly staff, and Dr. Mai is awesome.  It was nice to be able to "go to sleep" for my procedure..I was so relaxed  that I had no swelling from my two extractions.  This is my dentist for life.  I highly recommend this practice for all of your dental needs.
1	Any one notice how obsessed with having her picture and video blasted all over the web page for this office the dentist is? Be sure to really pay attention to all warnings about a place. They sent about 35+ people on a wild goose chase for an interview 8/22/14... when customers/patients complain about scams. ... this isn't a place you want to be employed by. I should've followed my gut. Avoid this place for employment or service- would be my best advice. Very unprofessional practices. Make sure to read the actual location's yelp page. And read all of the reviews that aren't recommended. There's a bunch of fluff from people that only reviewed that one place, but there are some real horror stories as well. Beware! Run!
1	This place is suppose to contact my Medicare & they threatened to put a restraining order against us now I can't even use my medical.
