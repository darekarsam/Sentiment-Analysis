5	Great new location!
5	Love the new location!  The staff seemed well trained and ready to handle the crowds---and people---that Star Bucks tend to draw.   Drinks were well made!
5	Awesome new location!  The baristas are friendly and knowledgable and the drinks are what you expect from a Starbucks.  There is also a good amount of indoor seating and free wifi
4	Sitting in your car and hitting the drive-thru is soooo west coast.  And, I love it!This is one of the first drive-thrus in the area for the Green Mermaid.  Surprisingly, there's a new "Pot Bellies" sandwich place going in right next door. Hmmm, might need to leave my car for that one. LOLLast night I received from Starbucks Galactic Command in SODO, a Member's Reward coupon for 50% off my next espresso beverage using Code 354.  Nice timing I thought. Drove by here around 9 this morning and there was six cars in front of me. It took less than five minutes for me to get to the front of the line, get my drink and pay. A Tip of the Hat as Colbert would say to the very fast baristas!Simple, fast and easy.
5	Awesome customer service , I go to this location specifically for the great employees
