5	Super friendly staff, great egg sandwich. They will make your food however you want. If they had a grill I would go there everyday.
5	Love this place. They make great Boars Head sandwiches!  Nothing fancy but that is what makes them great. And their macaroni salad & cole slaw are worth getting as well. Want a quality sandwich & side for a good price?  Hit this place!  Or grab a couple for a quick & easy picnic in the park. Staff is extremely friendly.

5	I have known this family for a few years now.  They are so friendly and kind. They make sure that when you walk in they greet you with your first name.  I have very high standards when it comes to customer service and these guys reach it hands down. Sandwiches are great. I love this place. Thanks guys for opening this location so close to my home.
