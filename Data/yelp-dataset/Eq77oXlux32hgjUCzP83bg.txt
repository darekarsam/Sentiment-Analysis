5	This was a great U-Haul to do business with. Friendly staff and made sure we got what we needed. They were busy but got to us as quick as possible. Said they were sorry It took as long as it did and had us on the road in 10 minutes.Rented 26' going to California = Truck was clean and comfortable to drive and the AC worked great.
4	Ok, they have this Re-Use Center, it's a big pen where anyone getting rid of something can donate. Anyone can take anything out of it they will use! LARGE hallways, easy to move around, AC on a good setting, and clean. Saw a security guard a couple times. The only reason they lost a star is I set the alarm that goes off if you get into a storage shed without telling the front desk, and no one came to check. ??? Other than that 5 Stars all the way.
