1	WHY?!! Is the question of the day.Because my mother said, "Let's go to Kmart - I haven't been in forever."Me: Ugh. Okay.(driving south for a looo-hooong time)Mom: Let's just turn around this is too far and this neighborhood is starting to look questionable. Why didn't you tell me it was this far?Me: Exactly! I did tell you it was quite a ways. But you had to experience it for yourself. Kmarts are located in low income neighborhoods and it's just around the other bend.Mom: Okay. As long as we are here.Me: Ooooh! I'll meet up with you both in a few ... there's a Beauty Supply store! (skipping along) ...
1	Talked to someone to day @ Kmart @ 336 e baseline got a camera for my daughter for a gift person I talked to was rude as hell then some one else talked to me they were more rude then the first person & said I can't return it because I don't have my receipt & there's nothing they can do sorry and hung up on me
2	The official Going Out of Business Sale has started, so negative feelings about this Kmart were presumably universal.By Kmart standards, it's large and clean. Which did it no good for survival because... Kmart. It's where you go when you want lower quality than Target at a higher price, which is never.The clerk who checked me out was downright pleasant and helpful, which is worth the extra star. The security guard checking receipts at the door was charming, though I have to ask... you're GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. Does loss prevention still really matter? I'm coming up dry on finding a planned closing date for this store -- heck, I can't even find it on a list of closures, so maybe staff just spontaneously decided to cut bait -- but I'd expect it to be gone by mid-January 2015. It is specifically NOT participating in the Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday sales, nor in any future offers in the circulars in the newspaper.
