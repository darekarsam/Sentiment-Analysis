2	This is an okay scotmid store, a bit on the small side (the one on Leith Walk is bigger and has more variety) but they have a good range of food and groceries. The staff are friendly but annoyingly they often query what I have in my basket. "Cigarettes? You shouldn't smoke! It's bad for you!" Yeah I know that. "Vodka? I personally don't drink, drinking is bad for you." Sure..."Paracetamol? You got headache? Must be from the vodka you bought last night!" How observant. I'm not ever buying tampons or condoms at this shop, that much I know. "You buying condoms? You have sex a lot, yes?""You buy tampons? You happy you not pregnant from all the sex, yes?"Some of the staff are also quite sneaky with scanning your items twice, so watch out for that. My guess is that they can take home those things at the end of their shift, as the stock system will have a surplus. They usually do it with things like snacks, so watch out for those tell tale double "beeps" when scanning one item!
4	There's rarely a day goes by when you won't see me in Scotmid.  It's two minutes from my flat, and terribly convenient! Yes, it's not the best Scotmid in Edinburgh, but it's far from the worst and usually has everything I want. Okay, they're sometimes lacking (like the time when they were out of broccoli for about two weeks), and they don't tend to stock the Co-op budget range (boo, I want the cheapest tinned tomatoes!), but on the whole it's a pretty decent selection.Like all Scotmids now, it also has a small bakery counter. However that's fairly pricey and it's literally next door to a Bayne's and a Gregg's, so your baked goods needs are met on Easter Road already (and if you can afford to, go slightly further up to Manna House anyway).So, there you go. It's a good little local 'super'market for those of us in the Easter Road vicinity, and I'll continue to give it my custom for as long as I live here.
