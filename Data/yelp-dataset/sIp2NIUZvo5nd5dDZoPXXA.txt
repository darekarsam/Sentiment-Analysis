1	First off - great job by the technician that came out to clean the windows.Issue is that the price that he then wanted to charge us was TWICE what was quoted over the phone (Bait and Switch??).  It appears that the person who gave the quote over the phone did not explain how they count windows, did not communicate to the tech what the quote was - or if he did, the tech did not clarify the difference in pricing until after he finished the work.Because of the amount they wanted to charge, and we finally paid, was significantly different than was quoted or clarified before work was completed - I would not recommend them unless they clean up their pricing practices.
5	My first star is given if they show up on time.  My second is the professionalism of the crew.  My third is value for service rendered. My fourth is related to their personality and trustworthiness   And if all the stars align, I am happy to give my fifth star.  Well done and thank you.
