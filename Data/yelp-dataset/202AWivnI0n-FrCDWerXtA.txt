5	Team Beckers did such a wonderful job in helping us find our dream home, our 1st home as a married couple. We did not make it easy for them as we had a lot of factors to take in to consideration but their persistence, patience, true honesty, experience & professionalism shined through and really got us that beautiful house we wanted in the right location for the best price.You won't be disappointed at all with their servicesMr & Mrs Morris
5	Lisa from Team Beckers is the kind of person that gets things done. Period. I recently recommend her to a friend and they worked tirelessly to help him find a second home in Las Vegas, NV. It's obvious that her strong work ethic has helped them achieve a number of successes in their career. Now if I could only find a way to deal with people like her on a consistent basis!
5	Team Beckers are hands down AMAZING. They are great people. My wife and I were finding our first home and thanks to the hard work and dedication of Team Beckers we were able to find just that. I am definitely going to recommend them to everyone. Many people stress about buying a new home, but if you have a good and knowledgable realtor such as the Beckers, the process will go by soooooo smooth. Please, if looking to purchase, CONTACT TEAM BECKERS...you wont regret it!
5	Peter and Lisa are the most caring, professional, and down to earth people I think we've met! We had such a great experience having them sell our home. Right from the beginning, they were advertising and having Open Houses, trying their hardest to sell our home. They both have excellent communication skills i.e. texting, phone calls, emails etc. They give you personalized attention and are very knowledgeable, that is what i liked most.**They also found my daughter a rental home for her and her family..  We would highly recommend this team! Our home sold in only 4 months :)
