4	It's Wendy's. You should know about Wendy's food. This one has friendly staff, good service, and usually has what I want even on late night food runs.
1	Worst Wendy's ever.
1	I ordered apple pecan chicken salad, fries and iced tea. This does not happens once but on other wendys store too. The salad has mold on cheese! All their salads are pre packed so I guess they serve it without expiration date. I would never eat their salad again. I would give them no star at all. Don't eat the salad until you look at it closely or worst tasted it.
1	Horrible service, horrible management,  by far the worst fast food restaurant I've ever been too.      I have had numerous issues with this particular location. We live nearby and this is one of very few options for late night food.  3 out of every 5 orders are incorrect or missing something. We always check our food in the parking lot, and even ask a few times while ordering or getting our food if everything is in the bag.     Avoid if you can
