5	I love Claudia and Tammy at Sweet Sunshine Nails. I've been coming here regularly for a couple of years. Both of them do a wonderful job at nails! I'm always happy. A great selection of standard nail polish colors, a nice selection of gel/shellac and glitters. They have minx stickers that stay on for a month! Plus they do waxing. It's a small studio so the experience is always personalized.
5	I've been going to Sweet Sunshine Nails for several years, and I love the CONSISTENT, quality service. I live nearby, so it's convenient for me, but it would be worth a longer drive for the quality of service. Truthfully, I often have time to get my nails done during my lunch hour, but I have tried 4-5 shops near my office in recent years, and NO ONE does the quality work that you get at Sweet Sunshine. It is a small shop - just Claudia and Tammie. They are BOTH great! You can't just walk in and get in line for any service you like. At the same time, Claudia will work with you to get you scheduled when you  need it. Both Claudia and Tammie are attractive (yes, this matters in the beauty business), pleasant, professional women. You never have to worry about being served by someone who was just standing outside on a smoke break - yuk! I feel as though they are loyal to me, and I am loyal to them.
