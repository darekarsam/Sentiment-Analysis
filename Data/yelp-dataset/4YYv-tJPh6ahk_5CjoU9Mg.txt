1	If you are white, don't go here... They do not like white people and they will tell you to your face.  They also break HIPAA laws.  Owens and pecos location is better, but you are better off going across the street to walgreens.
1	Horrible run around behavior. Wouldn't tell me if they had the quantity I needed to fulfill my prescription. Said I had to come in. So I'm suppose to run all over town taking my prescription in to every store to find out if they have it or not, when three other ones didn't!
1	Well after getting there and waiting 7 minutes in line (I was the second person in line and a lady standing around told me she had already been waiting 40 minutes for a prescription she was told would be ready at 4pm, it was already 4:40pm) The girl behind the counter did not say hello or anything and just looked at me, so I handed her my prescription and she started typing it in, then I put my drug card on the table and she took that one also.  Then she says "Its this store policy to not accept that drug card for this medicine (You see on the drug cards website it said CVS there would take their card FOR this medication and it would be $22.94, so without it, they can charge me $210 for it)  So VERY rude service and does not take insurance EVEN when your insurance card says they will.  So in other words they are trying to steal from people SO BE CAREFUL.
