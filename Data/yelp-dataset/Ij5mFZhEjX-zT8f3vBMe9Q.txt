4	Every year for the past three years we have celebrated Mothers Day at the Shriners Mother's Day Brunch. There is nothing fancy. Just tables nicely decorated with seating for around 16 people. We take a table as there are now our family, and the families of my son's wife and the family of my daughters husbands family. The food selection is second to none I have seen. Eggs fixed anyway you would want, pancakes, waffles with many toppings. Then there is prime rib, ham, turkey. All kinds of fruits and deserts. Aaaannndd you can eat till you pop. Not sure how the arrangements for the brunch work? My son always takes care of that part.
5	Red Fez room open for lunch again! Only open Wednesdays but good food and not crowded!
