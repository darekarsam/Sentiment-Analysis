3	If you're not a customer, I don't recommend making a withdrawal from this ATM. $3 is beyond insane, it's practically robbery. I guess that I'm just used to the UK where you can use any ATM, no matter where you bank, for free.But today was the day to open an account because I can't keep using my UK bank for US purchases. The process was simple and quick and the representative (Jeff) who helped me was pleasant and easy to talk to and while it did take about an hour, that was mostly taken up with talk about my travel to Europe. Totally not Jeff's fault there!The bank account I chose looks simple enough and with the activity I expect, the account is free. Fifth Third does have a decent network of ATM's and of course you can always get cash back at places that support such things.It would be four stars with the great service from Jeff, but I just can't endorse a $3 ATM. That's plain wrong.
1	Horrible!!! Wes Osbourne is the most disrespectful and unprofessional person maybe on the face of the earth ! To be honest no one at this bank is worth anything ! Sister passed away i was making payments on car until state issued power of attorney so I could pay it off went in to pay car off they lost death certificate and power of attorney so put me off and said come back that night they sent someone to repo car payment less than a week late!! Do yourself a favor do not get a loan or put money in this ridiculous so called bank!!
