1	My experience here was short lived.  I walked in to get an easy haircut, and was told by a soft spoken girl, I don't think we have anything left today.  She looked around, and just said I don't think we have anything left.  She then turned to some guy on the phone and asked we don't have anything left today?  And he just shook his head.  So she said how about you come back tomorrow?  No thanks, not going to travel back down from Charlotte for this place.I understand seeing a place completely busy, and for me to decide to walk out because I don't want to wait a quoted time, but this place was not busy at the time, and there was no one waiting.  It was not like I came in with 30 minutes until closing, I was there a couple hours before closing.  So much for walk ins welcome. While I can't say anything about their haircutting, I can say their customer service is highly lacking, with no greeting, no idea of what their schedule really is, and not really accepting walkins.
5	A great place to get a haircut.  The lady that cut my hair was very professional and did a great job on my hair.  Everyone there was super nice. They seemed to have a lot of regulars so it must be a good place to go.  It's going to be my new go to hair cutting place.
5	Love this salon! Always a great cut and color. The prices are good too. Always a great experience when I come here. They are really friendly and a lot of fun.
