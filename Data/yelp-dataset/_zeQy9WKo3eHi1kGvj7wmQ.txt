5	Heather is the best hair stylist I've ever been to! She's very knowledgable about hair and will tell you what you need to do to keep your hair healthy.  I've Been going to her for about 3 years now.  Even though I have moved out of state, I still make sure I see her anytime I come back.  I honestly can't find anyone better than her!
5	Heather is one amazing stylist! She has been my stylist for the past 9 years and I've always left the salon feeling completely happy and beautiful. She is up to date on all the current trends of hair styles, make up, etc. I've had color, highlights, up-do's, extensions, make up, eye brow waxing and never ever been disappointed! I love the personable service. She really gets to know her clients and you will walk out of the salon feeling fabulous!!!
