4	This food truck makes some pretty good waffles.  You have the option of sweet ones or more savoury ones.  I opted for a waffle with strawberries which was served piping hot and really hit the spot.  The waffles are made to order so they are very fresh.  This does mean though that there can be a wait.  I also had the misfortune of placing my order just as they ran out of batter so I had an additional wait while they prepared more.   I would still highly recommend this food truck though because their waffles are quite good and make the wait worth it.
3	I hate to knock down Gaufrabec a star because when food trucks hit the scene last year they were one of my favourites with their fresh to order waffles but my last experience there was less than stellar.  I ordered a simple chocolate waffle but I found it to be quite stale.  This time around they were just reheating waffles they had made earlier so I'm pretty sure that this is what made the waffle so lacklustre.  The chocolate filling was good but everything else left a lot to be desired.
4	I've eaten waffles in Belgium before and the waffles of Gaufrabec are just as delicious.
3	This food truck is unique as it is the only food truck in Montreal to serve Belgian waffles.  I had the blueberry waffle.  It's also interesting that the filling was inside the waffle as opposed to on top.Despite the above, I wasn't too amazed.  The waffle wasn't super crispy and the blueberry flavour was a bit bland.  So while this place is unique, it's not exceptional or anything.
2	I was very disappointed by my waffle. I ordered a plain one, because in my experience they are perfect and sweet on their own. It's great when the sugars are just perfectly caramelized, but mine was burnt. Tasted awful. That, and the fact that they were not making fresh waffles to order (they were "warming up") leaves nothing redeeming about this truck - and no reason to ever order from them again. Damn.
