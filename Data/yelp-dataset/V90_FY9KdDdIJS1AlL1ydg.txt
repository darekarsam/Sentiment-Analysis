5	My favorite place to come chill and smoke hookah. They have a great selection of flavors and an awesome bar. The staff is welcoming and don't make you feel like you're just another customer. I honestly don't even need to pick a flavor most of the time, because Lillie will always make a great recommendation. The environment is very relaxed and just feels like a place for you and your friends to come hang out and enjoy your night! I wish I lived closer so I could come hang out all the time!
5	This place is awesome! My wife I have been to a lot of different hookah bars but this was our favorite. Great specials on traditional hookahs before 8pm and also a great drink selections whether you like liquor or draft beer. The bartender made a really good hookah selection for us when we could make up our mind. Make sure to check Red @ 28th out even if your not a huge hookah smoker, great place to have a few drinks and just chill!
4	Red @ 28th recently opened a new location a few months back in University and I have absolutely fell in love with it. It has the same artsy and relaxing feel as Amelie's but... theres alcohol and hookah! This is a great place to go with friends or even just by yourself to relax and study. They offer a variety of hookah flavors and offer re-packs for only $10. The thing that I love about this place is that it provides a great atmosphere to just lay back and enjoy conversing with your friends without the overpowering music that most bars and lounges have. I feel like I'm just lounging in my friend's living room with a full service bar staff. I would definitely recommend this place to others, especially UNCC Students.
