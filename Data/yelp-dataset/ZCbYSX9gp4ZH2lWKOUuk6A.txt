5	Oops...-I forgot to add to my review about Jayme my stylist...that out of all the cities I've lived in & stylists I've visited...Jayme is by far my favorite & the most personable & talented stylist in town! Make an appointment today...you won't be disappointed!!!:)
5	I've been having my hair cut and styled by Alan for over 4 years. He is fantastic and I am always happy with the results.
5	A woman named Stella works here and I intentionally drive out of my way because she is both very sweet and very, VERY talented. She can do anything. I hope to never have another hairdresser ever. There isn't even enough words to describe how amazing and informed she is.
