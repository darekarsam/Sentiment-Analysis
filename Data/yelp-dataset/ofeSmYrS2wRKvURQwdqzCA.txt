4	Cute, mod-themed hair salon. Located just off of the Main in the Plateau, but missed easily by tourists. Owned by the lovely, irreverent, story-telling Anthony. Specializes in mod cuts. Space is populated by obscure Japanese cult-ephemera and quality vintage knick-knacks, collected by the charismatic wife of the owner. Can often "squeeze" in new clients last-minute. Most salons don't have half the personality of Metropolar!
5	Superbe petit salon avec une des meilleures stylistes en ville! Bianca est la meilleure; je lui fait confiance avec mes cheveux depuis 7 ans !
4	I was in Montreal for F1 weekend.  I couldn't be happier to find this place and get the cut I needed.  Great atmosphere, skilled barbers, reasonable prices.   I'll be back next year.
