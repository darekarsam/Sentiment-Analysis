5	I am rating Hyundai only.Do you do your due diligence on cars? Do you dislike pushy salespeople? Do you know as much about the vehicle you're going to buy as the salesperson?  Then you should like this dealer.  They are relatively no-nonsense.I worked with Ed Doyle a couple times in the past to buy my wife's car, to buy my truck, and to buy another car for my brother in law.Even though he couldn't get us the deal we wanted on the car for my brother in law, he never tried to take advantage of us. He steered us in a good direction, so to speak.They are straightforward, they are all business, and won't act condescending or patronizing.  I would highly recommend them as a dealer in the area.
