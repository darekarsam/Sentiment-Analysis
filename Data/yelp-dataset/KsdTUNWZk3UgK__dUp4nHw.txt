1	Terrible terrible waste of money and awful customer service. They improperly installed the frame of our mattress so that it broke. They will not fix this and told us to buy a new one. The bed has become so uncomfortable in under two years, sinking nearly and inch on my side, that I frequently sleep in my guest bedroom, on a much, much cheaper mattress that is far more comfortable. Do not waste your money on this product. I would give it zero stars if that was an option.
5	Always a great experience when we go in to shop. Greeted with friendly service and helpful staff!  Purchases always smooth and easy. Thank you for great place to furniture shop!
3	After posting several negative reviews to sites like this one, I finally was able to get some movement from this company. Initially I was told that even though my bed frame broke due to improper installation by the company that I would have to buy and install a new one myself. This did not seem right. It did take several weeks of phone calls to finally get the issue resolved but I am not satisfied with the way things turned out. They replaced the bed frame and the bed is much more comfortable now. My faith in Tyndall has been restored by a good margin.
1	I bought Tyndall Pedic mattress in 2012. One week I called as we did not like it but they said use for at least one year. We still don't like as so soft. Complaint department won't do any thing. We paid very dearly for this mattress but will never buy again unless they give us firm mattress which they were suppose to sell us.Beware of advertisment on radio.
