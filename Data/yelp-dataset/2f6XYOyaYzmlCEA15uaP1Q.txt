3	Doctors and nurse practitioners are always great. My only complaint is the front desk staff, the girl at the front desk was more interested in discussing her dinner plans with a coworker than helping me check in. She made me feel like i was intruding. When I walked out of the exam room, she was looking at me, I asked if there was anything else I needed and she stated, if the dr did not say you needed another appt, you can go. Very abrupt, if she is still employed there next time, I will find a new dr.

5	I'm so glad that I picked this practice.  Not only is it down the street from my job, everyone here is so pleasant.  From the receptionist to the doctor.  I was a little worried after I was sitting in the waiting room for about 5 minutes, about 10-15 people showed up and it looked like all the appointments might have been scheduled around the same time.  Luckily I didn't have to wait too long.  The physician's assistant was so sweet and personable.  The doctor was straight to the point and perscribed me topical medications immediately, she wasted no time.  I have a follow up appointment in 2 months and I'm already looking forward to going back because of the atmosphere.  Thank you Dr. Edwards!
