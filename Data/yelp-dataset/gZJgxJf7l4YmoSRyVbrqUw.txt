4	I have back problems (who doesn't, right?), but I found that this location is one of the better places I've ever gone to. They have high end technology that goes right along with a knowledgeable chiropractor and super friendly receptionists. Dr. Palamone is funny, doesn't sugar coat anything, and has a genuine desire to help.
5	My friend goes to Carnegie Mellon University and he hadn't had much luck with physical therapy for his back pain. I looked up Forest Hils-contacted them to see what they were all about and bought him three visits. Just got the thank you card in the mail so I'm guessing they worked. The chiro I spoke with seemed very knowledgable and seemed to practice a diverse set of skills(as opposed to just manipulations for everyone).
5	Dr Micheal Palamone is a very experienced doctor who efficiently woke up the natural healing instincts of my body! He uses multiple tools to assist his patients but his skillful hands are a credit to the Chiropractic profession!  I recommend him to other friends sincerely, Francis Bruce Marion BS, DC
