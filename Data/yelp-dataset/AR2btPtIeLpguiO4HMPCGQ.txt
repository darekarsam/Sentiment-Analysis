2	One word: pretentious. While their clothing collections always look crisp and fresh (no, we're not talking lettuce here people), they are highly over-priced for the quality of the clothing that they sell. In addition, many of their collections seem inspired by furniture or curtain fabrics. I don't know what's up with that. It's very preppy with a dash of hipster so if that's your thing, you'll be very happy. That said, beware - most of their items are dry-clean only, and those that are washable in your washing machine will fade very quickly. The staff is uninterested and seem to have a superiority complex about their place of work. It's a clothing store, where the bulk of the clothes is made in China - not the UN. Get over yourself. Don't expect a high level of service unless you walk in clearly advertising your wealth. Then perhaps the staff will remember that their job is to greet you with a smile, and help you spend your money.
4	yes, it is expensive. quality can be so-so but i still love the place especially their monster clearance sale.it's one of the few places where not only can i find my size but get the interesting color scheme that i so love. i buy most of my shirts and some of my colorful chinos here and quality wise, they are still holding up quite well.the bad? barely any customer service but i rarely need them so it doesn't really bother me.the ugly? no online shopping for quebec residents. why? language policy.. and sales rep appearing out of nowhere to take your stuff to the registry so they can put their name down. i've seen it with most male reps (in my case) and it is quite annoying.still, it doesn't deter me from the place because they have what i want. in the end, that's what matter most to me
