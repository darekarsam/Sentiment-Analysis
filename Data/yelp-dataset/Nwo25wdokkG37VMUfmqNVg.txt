4	Great guac, great soup!
3	Right off the bat: the food here is good. My burrito al pastor was a bit skimpy on the al pastor part, but tasted good and was also enormous. They really seem to love chipotle, which can be too smoky for me, but to each their own (or, using my new phrase gleaned from a Pgh cabbie: horses for courses!)The guacamole is really good and made fresh at your table. You see exactly what goes in to it and can decide how spicy you want. We went whole hog on the chiles and it wasn't all that warm, but it could just have been those peppers.The horchata is a little sweeter and cinnamon-y-er than I prefer, but again, different strokes.So, three stars are why? Well, the layout is weirdly very very open. It's not especially inviting to sit down, and service isn't super attentive.But mostly: what is up with restaurants in Pittsburgh not turning on the heat in winter? Here and at another place I had to wear my knee length puffer coat and my scarves through the entire meal. It's not nice, and I don't like it.
4	Last night's quick dinner at Mexico City was a nice surprise.  I live nearby and was concerned that it is never really busy during normal dinner hours.   I was raining so I went in.  There is a lot to choosee from and all seems fairly authentic.   I opted for the vegetable soup and some tacquitos dorados.   Both were excellent.  Thesoup was rich and homey.   The fried tacquitos were stuffed with lamb and deliscious.   I was still thinking about them today!  I will definately return without hesitation.   Oh yeah and our waitress was excellent!
3	I love that they're open late (often 2 or 3 am), but the food has just been so-so the last couple of times I went. I think the tacos at Round Corner Cantina are far superior to these, and the burritos here are sub-par too. Decent if you need a late night snack, but not worth going out of your way for.
