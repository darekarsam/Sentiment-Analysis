5	I have my own personal training studio located on Lancaster Hwy, and health nutz is the most convenient location. That alone brought me in, but the store owner is very knowledgeable, always well stocked, clean, and checked out very quick. Prices are far better than GNC & Vitamin Shoppe. I used to be an online shopper but being able to drive to the store and pick out what you want is my preference as long as the prices are close. With GNC, prices are marked up so high I just went straight to the internet.I've sent many of my clients to his shop knowing they'll be well taken care of. Never got a single complaint from a client of mine dealing with HealthNutz. http://www.taylorcarpenter-pt.com
5	Having knowledgeable staff is very helpful when one has vitamin or supplementation questions. Being conveniently located near my studio allows my clients to obtain the items we discuss that are correct for them and compliments their fitness program. Thanks Zac!
4	Great local nutrition store, prefer to shop here instead of GNC or Vitamin Shop . Owner will match prices and will get you a supplement if he can if he doesn't carry it. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly .
