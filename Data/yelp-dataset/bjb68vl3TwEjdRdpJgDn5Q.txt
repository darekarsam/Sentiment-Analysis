5	All Vegas Auto Glass do excellent work!  They're quick, courteous and really know what they're doing. First class operation. Five Stars all the way!
5	Great service and amazing price! I have a 2012 BMW and BMW wanted 2,700 for a oem windshield. They were able to get it for 800.00. That made me much happier, the service was complete right and in a short amt or time.
5	Five stars is not enough! I had a crack in my windshield and needed it fix ASAP, in just a day they were able to come to my house and fix it at the lowest price! Jose and Luis did a fantastic job in less than an hour. Thank you guys so much.
