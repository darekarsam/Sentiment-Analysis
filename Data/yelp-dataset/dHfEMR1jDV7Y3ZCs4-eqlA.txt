4	I love Total Wine. Whenever I am in town I stop by one of their stores. They have like 40+ stores over six states (NJ, DE, VA, NC, SC, FL). They have thousands of brands of wine, beer and spirits. Prices are pretty good too.
4	Yippee!!!!Total Wine now carries the Great Lakes Brewing Co. brand.I'm not much of a beer drinker but this helps the homesickness a bit.  Total Wine has earned a very loyal customer.
5	Staff is extremely helpful.
4	Staff is always willing to help you find what your looking for. Great selection of beer! The prices are also a lot cheaper then HT or Food Lion.
5	My husband and I love coming here. Paul, the guy with the red hair is always helpful when it comes to helping you pick out something that suits your palate.  The prices can't be beat! One great thing that I love is the chiller that they have located up front... pick out any bottle and get it chilled to your liking in minutes!
4	Located in a strip mall on Independence Blvd. This location seems to be a little bit bigger than the one I usually shop at (Myers Park). Very much like the other locations well laid out with a nice selection of craft beers, you won't find much in the way of hard to find or rare beers, but for readily available stuff it's a decent place. I like the fact that you are able to build a mixed six pack. The service is not great unless you are shopping for wine, but I usually don't need assistance anyway.I think I still prefer the Myers Park location, but if I'm on this side of town it's worth a stop in.
