5	I am always so impressed with the wide section and assortment of products  available at Vasco!They really do stock a lot of product, plus this is a great place to find not just cigars but also unique gifts. They have a great sections for men's gifts and accessories.
4	At home we refer to Vasco as "the man store" because they stock a lot of stereotypical man stuff: cigars and accesories, shaving accesories, drinking accessories, and on and on.  Not that a woman who likes those sort of things couldn't shop there, it's just oftentimes when I want to purchase a gift for my hard to buy for man, this is where I end up.  The store itself is quite cavernous, filled to the brim (quite literally, the shelves go all the way up to a mezzanine!) with goodies.  Upon entering I am always greeted by someone, and I always explain that I'm going to take a look around, and ask for help when I'm ready.  I have always had good experiences, getting good advice when I ask for it.  I'm given honest opinions, and options within my price range, without the pressure to up sell.  And the gifts have always gone over well, whether it was the time I bought a humidor, or the time I bought a shaving brush, the gifts have always been well received (it helps that I know the recipient extremely well) and I felt I spent my cash well.
