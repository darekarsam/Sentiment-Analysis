4	I tend to go here on the quiter nights Which is usually a Sunday. If you like wild partys with no room to move go on a Friday or a Saturday by all means. This palce sells brilaint pints with some of the best beers.
4	I popped in here with my partner on our anniversary tour of Scotland. Honestly - it is the friendliest pub we have been to so far in Edinburgh. We were early on a Saturday night and stopped in b/c I had recognized it from searching gay friendly pubs online. We were very pleased with the bartenders and beer prices and will stop back in before we leave the country. Good mix of people and age groups - friendly staff, good atmosphere. Really good time (minus the one Really drunk guy  - but that happens)
