4	This is an awesome pawn shop, a hidden gem.  I stopped by to browse some items and was pleasantly surprised to find a ton of great stuff for sale.  You have to park in the rear of the place and the entrance to the lot is on the North side of the building.  You can't get into the lot from anywhere else.  Once you get inside, the place is full of quality items.  I saw a nice congo drum set, golf clubs, jewelry, and Native American jewelry.  The prices are very reasonable too.Even though I was supposed to be just browsing, I ended up buying the Wife a silver necklace and myself a utility wedge...ha ha!  I couldn't help it.Return Factor - 95%
2	Good pawn shop a lot of items at high prices of course general manager Paul was rude most likely won't be returning simply for the lack of respect
2	The pawn shop itself has a wide selection of jewelry, appliances, watches, etc. However the staff that I encountered both times I was there were very rude. They acted very pretentious and were not the best negotiators.
