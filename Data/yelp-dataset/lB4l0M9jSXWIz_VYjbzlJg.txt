5	Great food at relatively cheap prices. Their steak hoagie is great! I can't tell you about anything else because that is all I get!
3	OMG! Finally! A pizza shop that doesn't charge $8 for a head of lettuce and a hand full of veggies. The food is pretty good and very affordable. The only problem I have is that my workplace puts in a $300+ order every friday and they never throw out any deals. Not that they have to but it would at least show that they value and appreciate their customers' business.
4	This is the best pizza in Oakland. That is saying a lot because there are several good places in the area. Since the location is a bit away from the center of Oakland, this place can get very busy for dining in. I have found the best time to go is about 1pm on weekdays. The hospital people usually fill the place at 11am and the office types jam the place at noon. If your going to eat there, make it a late lunch.My only complaint is the location and like another reviewer has stated, they don't often deliver.
5	If you want a good deal then come here! Their pizza is out of this world and very affordable! The customer service is amazing too! I pick this place over Milanos any day! They know my order and my name and very personable.
