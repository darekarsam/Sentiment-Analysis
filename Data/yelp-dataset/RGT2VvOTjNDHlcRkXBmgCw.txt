4	Pretty good for fast food wings.  The 911 sauce is FIREBALL, so you might want to lay off that.
2	We ordered from a different location (beaubien) but since it's not represented here & I'm lazy today I'll just add my review to this location, it being a franchise & all.We ordered the 911 and the Caribbean jerk flavoured wings.  The 911 were pretty spicy, not TOO crazy (for a spice-fiend like me)..however the flavour wasn't great.I hate, with a passion, Frank's red-hot sauce, you know, the junk they seem to throw on ALL wings..and they reminded me of a spicier Frank's. Why is it so hard to make your own hot-sauce? I'd love some habanero flavoured wings for once, and make it fresh so you don't have to add 8 jugs of vinegar.The jerk wasn't spicy at all & lacked the flavour layers a good jerk is supposed to have (I have to add that my husband liked it).All in all, another generic wing place.One day someone has to say no to these horrible overrated overused hot-sauces...anyone? Please, I would love to eat some really spicy & tasty wings I didn't have to make myself, for once.
2	I ordered a original cheese steak sandwich, it was not very good at all almost no cheese I couldn't see any or taste any at all for that matter. Came with 4 wings I took the 911 sauce. The wings are deep fried witch I like but are so small hardly any meat on them at all. The fries where your substandard frozen fries not very good at all. The sauce had a little kick but not a original or amazing taste at all basicly franks red lot and viniger.The price is descent but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
