1	This place is a dump .... mold everywhere toilets.sinks.showers in cabinets would not deem reasonable for a prison let alone an apartment complex
1	These "residential suites" are nothing more than a run down, dated and dirty cheap hotel. Typical low class residents, guests and especially "management". What a joke! They will try to get $$ from you anyway they can. My son was going to rent a studio here, but after we experienced the "management" first hand we decided not to proceed. Kept his money anyway. BEWARE! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED NOW TWICE by your fellow Yelpers! Stay clear of this dump and their minimum wage staff.
1	I have to agree with the 2 guys that gave this place 1 star. The people are pretty cool that I've met while staying here but that is the only good thing I can say about this place. We stayed here because it is close to our house that is being remodeled. The management is horrible they will never take ANY responsibility if something happens! We moved in and we had to sleep on a beat up mattress and a box spring that had wheels screwed into it. After 2 nights we started getting bit, it turns out the box spring had bed bugs in it. When we complained the awesome management and they accused us of bringing them in.  These cheap people would not get rid of the box spring so we threw it out. Went and bought a bed and used that for the rest of our stay. We bought the wifi that the complex offers but the signal is so bad we ended up getting a refund. I have lived in rough places but this was by far worse than living in the projects. Please think twice about renting from this place save yourself some headaches and look elsewhere.
