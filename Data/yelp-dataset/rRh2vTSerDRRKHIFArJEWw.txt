5	I work in the downtown area and order Jimmy John's a few times a week. Their sandwiches are delicious and so fresh. The delivery is very fast, and the people that work here are very nice. Always a great experience with this location.
5	So fast and always friendly staff. Love their delivery to my work! Keep up the great work! Love wheat bread they make...yum!
4	Freaky Fast is an understatement. I literally had my sandwich before I was done signing the credit card slip. I didn't realize the guy making sandwiches behind the counter was listening when I placed my order and when my sandwich came up, I seriously thought it was for someone who ordered long before me. The three of us in our party were definitely impressed! My sandwich was not only out quickly, it was delicious. They offer self service fountain beverages and also serve fresh brewed iced tea. There is plenty of seating both indoors and out. I am definitely a fan and will return.
