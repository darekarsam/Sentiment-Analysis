5	If you are looking for a professional realtor, look no further.  Harvey will be honest and upfront about your real estate needs.  He works for you and has your best interest in mind for your situation whether purchasing or selling.
5	I would recommend Harvey and his team to anyone. We worked with Harvey in selling our home last year and the process was smooth, professional and very comfortable. It was obvious from all our convesations and interactions that Harvey and his team truly had our best interest at heart and wanted to help us secure the best offer. If you have a home to sell or buy and are looking for an ethical, honest and experienced realtor, you definitely need to contact Harvey at Prudential Americana.
5	When we were looking for our new home we called Harvey with Brown Blankfeld. He was able to show us just what we were looking for. A "not so long story ends" with us getting our dream home. Thank you Harvey.
5	We had our home listed by 3 different agents in the distant past and our house didn't sell. We were nervous about listing it again especially having kids and getting the house ready to list. Harvey was great on giving us suggestions on price and things that we could do to prepare the house. We did the few things that he recommended.  We immediately started getting people through and after about a month had an offer for the listing price. We also needed help finding a place to go. Harvey's team helped us find a prefect place to go in the area that we were looking to go to. They were patient with us in finding the right house. I would recommend them to anyone for selling and buying. They have a great system and team to get it done.
