5	Discovered this place before Christmas when it was under different ownership and loved it, was just as impressed when we returned. The service was great, the food was amazing and the staff were so friendly. Go there anytime I'm in Edinburgh now.

4	Having I think been in here once many years ago when it was still Lazio's I can't say I'd ever really given it much thought since, it was just one of those restaurants that seem to have been around forever & likely to continue as such. As the Japanese place across the road was oddly closing at 9pm, however, Frizzante got our business at the start of December and that proved to be a good choice.The crostini starter was attractively presented & a pleasing size. The two different risottos ordered (funghi misti & al martin) were also great in terms of taste & portion size whilst the tirmisu was doorstep size & the panacotta enjoyably firmer than anticipated.As mentioned by an earlier reviewer the restaurant was very clean and the service was friendly and attentive throughout. Once I've visited again I would imagine a fifth star will be the order of the day.
