3	Like Darren, I think this Exchange location doesn't have quite the extensive selections that some of the others do.  Still it's pretty convenient being right around the corner from work and I like to browse here occasionally on my lunch hour.  I've found a few goodies here like Wilco's "The Whole Love" and "Kicking Television" and Uncle Tupelo's "March 16-20 1992".  One of my colleagues was all agog having found "The Simpsons Complete 2nd Season" for only $7.00.Plus the guys who work here are pretty friendly.
4	Great store, staff was friendly. Huge selection of video games from Atari to Xbox 360, tons of dvds, cds, and some comics/records. Didn't have much time to browse so just kinda glanced at everything.  Stopped in for a Missile Command glass we saw in the window. While Eide's has more of a selection, it all comes down to what you're looking for and the price. The price point seems fair here vs the higher prices at Eide's.
