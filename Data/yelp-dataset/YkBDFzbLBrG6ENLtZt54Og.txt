5	Absolutely the nicest, most beautiful and unique convention area in Las Vegas. The bathrooms are always kept clean, with complimentary individual size mouthwash and lotion by every sink, restocked regularly. The hallway is breathtaking, one wall is entirely glass, overlooking the pool complex, and letting in actual sunlight, so one can still get one's daily dose of Vitamin D even in a full day of meetings! There are modern, sleek looking couches and loveseats that are very comfortable to relax in. The meeting rooms and ballrooms are designed beautifully, with wood paneling and acoustically absorbing wall panels (important to me as a sound engineer working in them!). Even the outdoor smoking area is well kept, with real trees for shade. It's definitely my favorite place to work in town.
3	This place was our last resort option for watching the Mayweather fight out at another casino rather than paying thousands to try to get into the actual fight at the MGM Grand. The convention center was located so far away from everything else in the hotel and before entering they check all your bags, run a metal detector over you and you have to either drink your drinks before entering or throw them away. Kinda lame. Walking inside was a little bit of a surprise, there were sooo many large screens all around the room and tons of large round tables. It could probably fit a few hundred people in there comfortably. They did have a few bars set up serving up drinks and food stands serving hot dogs, popcorn, sandwiches and such.The whole experience was cool, being out in Vegas and having somewhere to watch the fight with a whole lot of other people but i'm not sure that it was worth $90, yea it was kinda steep just to sit in this room and watch the fight on those huge screens. But Aria was one of the few casinos that was actually offering this so that was a plus, we couldn't miss the fight.
