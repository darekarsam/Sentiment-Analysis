4	I come here because of the fabulous Laura R, so tip of the hat and symbolic FTR to her. This has become one of my regular spots in the market, it's tucked right in the warm belly of Jean Talon and there are always bags of beans spilling and roasting, and friendly trilingual staff pouring the tasty good stuff. The real reason I'm here several times a week though is the breakfast sandwich - English muffin toasted with egg, nice local ham, and cheese for 2.75$. Gotta love breakfast for under three bucks, especially when it comes in sandwich form.
4	Went to the Marche Jean-Talon and was surprised to find this was one of the few stalls open at 8:30am.  Ordered a chai latte,  creme de carousel soup,  many vanilles(?),  Bagel with creme cheese and hot mocha.   The service was great and the lady helping us was patient with our questions. I was not accustomed to their method of making chai lattes in soup bowls.   However the soup was utterly fantastic. Great place to go to if you happen upon the Marche in the earlier hours of winter. Free Wi-Fi throughout the market was a bonus too. A little too much creme cheese in my bagel, but that can be easily adjusted yourself.
2	I have tried so hard to like this place because of their great location in the Jean-Talon Market, but a coffee spot on the edge of Little Italy has to do a better job than this. I'm not a fan of their espresso nor of their brewed coffee nor of their beans. (I guess the last item on my list probably covers the other two, eh?)
3	This review is for the little taco stand they have out front.  3 for 5.50.  The tacos themselves were just ok, your standard tortilla, shredded pork, beans, and onions.  The standout was the hot sauce.  If you're a fan of the hot stuff and want to start off exploring the market with a kick, try the tacos with a healthy serving of the hot sauce.
