5	The first time I stepped into this studio I was skeptic of hot yoga in general.  I was amazed by what I discovered in just the first class.  The teachers really have a passion for what they do, the focus is on creating a welcoming and warm environment to help students of all levels achieve their goals.  The ownership has recently changed, and since then the sense of community seems to be stronger than ever.  The teachers take time to get to know you, and are available before and after class to answer any questions.  The classes themselves really pack a lot into a quick hour class with a flow style sequence that gets the heart pumping and sweat flowing.  The heat isn't as hot as other studios I have been to, it's warm enough to keep your muscles limber, but the focus is on the poses, not the heat, which has helped me get amazing results.  Don't let the hour class and lower temperatures fool you, these teachers really know how to push you to your limits.   I can't say enough great things about this studio!
5	I have been practicing with Pura Vida for over a year now and absolutely love this studio. I have visited many studios and I found that the community here is really unique. From the moment you walk in you feel welcomed and are greeted by your first name. The instructors have helped me to strengthen my practice. Not only do I get a killer work out here, I feel that I leave with a calm mind and an overwhelming feeling of peace. They have taught me to go into advanced poses (which I never thought I could do) and how to stay committed to my yoga and to my health. The classes are an hour long. You will be taken through a variety of poses throughout each sequence. The sequence changes with each class and the instructors will lead the class based on the student's and their needs. How awesome is that! If you love yoga or are looking for something new, I would recommend trying this studio out.
