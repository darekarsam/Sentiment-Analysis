5	Rent affordable! Accepts dogs of all sizes and breeds. Staff is friendly. Quiet neighborhood.
3	I've lived here for almost 2 years. The all breeds dog policy is a huge plus for a pit owner like myself. Its a pretty quite complex segregated mostly into family and casual quite partiers in the complex. The staff is friendly and helpful. My only complaint is the guy above me who plays piano at 5 am. The walls and floors are rather thin.
3	When I first moved in pinnacle grove the staff was very nice. I rented from a guy name James and he made it so easy for me. Then I wanted to upgrade to a two bedroom and he made it super easy and didn't charge me crazy fees. Then a new management came in and they weren't personal at all which I understand it's hard to remember everyone. My rent went up a little bit and I thought I was paying to much so I decided to move. Not a bad apartment complex though great location it was pretty quite when I lived there. The only cons are you have to pay for covered parking and if you live in the front there is no guest parking. Also I was starting to get bugs I don't know with all the painting and stuff they were doing to the complex but I hate bugs!
1	So far, I'm not impressed. I have had to call maintenance twice and I've lived here less than two months. Now, I have no AC and they aren't offering much to help! While the maintenance team has been great and helpful, I feel like no one in the office listens or pays attention. When I call and the property manager answers, I assume my issue will be taken care of. So far, it has been quite the opposite. I was even told by staff that I shouldn't leave important matters to him. When I call with an issue, I expect it handled same day, or at least give me an update if that's not possible.I will not be renewing when my lease is up.
