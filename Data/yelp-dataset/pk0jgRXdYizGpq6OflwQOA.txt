2	I stop in at Taco Bell about once a week, typically going to the one on McClintock & Ray. Today I was in a different part of town so I came to this one instead. The service was typical for a drive-thru, but that surprised me as I was under the impression that ALL of Taco Bell was pushing for better customer service. The location on McClintock and Ray always has AMAZING customer service, with the drive-thru attendant genuinely asking how your day is going and occasionally throwing out a joke but always offering a smile.
5	I placed a huge order at this Taco Bell, and the manager, Tony, was great! The staff was friendly and the service was fast! They got my order out in no time, and continued to serve other customers while they filled my large order. I would definitely visit this location again.
3	Gotta love the dbacks special... Every time they score 6 runs,  its 3 free tacos with a drink the next day... And thats the only reason I come here.   The meat is tasty and seasoned well,  but I can't help but think I could make better tacos at home.  OK,  so It's probably cheaper and deffently easier to get the Dbacks special,  so I'll be back to Taco Bell the next time the Dbacks score 6 runs.  Average food for a way better than average price,  what more can you ask for?
