4	Only place I will go! I get my hair cut, eyebrows waxed, nails and pedicures done here. There is sometimes a wait, but only because they are that good! Best pedicure I've ever had!
4	I have been going here to get my feet done for the last 10 years.  They are very detailed and get upclose and personal with your feet. All pedicures and manicures come with the wax dip, which is extra a many other nail shops. The best times to come are the weekdays, but even when you come on the weekends you don't have to wait to long.  They always have ample staff to do nails and feet.  The pedicure chairs a plentiful and the motors on the massagers are strong.  They also have a full service salon.  Offer waxing of eyebrows and body waxing.
