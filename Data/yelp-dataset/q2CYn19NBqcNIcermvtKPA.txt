4	I've been using this dry cleaner for about a month now and I must say I'm pretty impressed.  First is the friendly service, heck they even let me put my diet Dr. Pepper on my laundry bill when I dropped it off the other day.  Sounds simple enough but I kind of doubt most places would be ok with that.  Most would have forced me to pay for that right then and there.  The dry cleaning and laundry service itself is as good I've ever had and the location of this place relative to my workplace just fits the bill completely.  Only downside would be that there is no parking so if you are looking to park and pick up or drop off you might have an issue.  I walk into work so that's not an issue for me.
4	Love love my dry cleaner and sundries spot here in Wells Fargo 3.  This is a full service dry cleaner as well as a convenient store type spot.  If you need anything while at the office - they have it!  Drinks and snacks, cards to items you may need away from home.This is the only dry cleaner in town I trust with my items.  I can drop something off in the morning and they will have it by the next day after 5pm!  Love that! They also take very good care of your clothes.  I dropped off a dress of my grandmothers for cleaning and when I went to pick it up they were showing me how the dress would be ruined if they cleaned it because of the fragile seams.  I didn't even notice!  But they did - they take extra care of you!If you are a regular they will give you a sack to take home and use instead of using your own bags.  You can just drop the sack and they already have you in their system.  Very convenient!  Love it!
