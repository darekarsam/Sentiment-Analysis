4	You can't go wrong with red Devil been eating there for over 30 years this restaurant is just an extension of the original McDonald 32nd St. you'll love it and the prices are reasonable.The pizza crust is in a class by itself.
2	NO.This order as you walk in, pay there (including a tip) and have the food delivered to your table concept is awful and confusing and no bueno.  The food at Red Devil is delicious, I'll state that for the record.  The standing there and deciding what your whole table wanted to eat and drink as people queue up behind you and out the door idea is awful!!  And to make matters worse, since the person running the food out to the table (are they a waiter? a food deliverer??) has no idea what you ordered at the register, so when you mention that you also placed a To Go order to take to someone at home, you can expect a lot of confusion between the food deliverer, the kitchen and the person at the cash register.  What a frigging mess.  :/I'll stick with the old fashioned sit down Red Devil restaurants, thanks.
5	My wife and I will not eat pizza and wings anywhere else. Hands down the best (crispy crust) pizza in AZ!
5	I recently found out that this FAMILY OWNED restaurant has been in AZ for 50 years. Are you kidding?! That is incredible for a restaurant; + it is not a chain. I really am not so shocked though. This place is so consistent. Enough talk about how one pizza place taste like New York. Really, stop it! I am from Brooklyn, NY and there is NO pizza in Arizona that comes close to tasting like New York pizza does. That is not a bad thing either. I'll tell you why. There is not a pizza joint in New York that tastes anything like a Red Devil Pizza. We truly are blessed to have pizza this good and unique in Arizona. Now, it has taken 50 years to open only 5 stores. I think the Bistro is the newest location. Whatever they want to call it is fine, it is still a Red Devil.
