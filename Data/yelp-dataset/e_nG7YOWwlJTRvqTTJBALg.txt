5	I visited this nursery yesterday for the first time and was surprised by the amount of knowledge shared by the owners, Kim & Dan. I had a million questions and they took the time to answer in detail every one. Picked up a longan, mango, and banana. Just wish the were a little closer to me!
5	I love plants, trees, flowers, herbs...and needless to say I'm always on a lookout for awesome unique nurseries.Found this one on Yelp and I'm glad we decided to stop by. The outside, parking area looked a little strange and I had to convince hubby not to drive away and he was glad I did.This nursery is a local business. A couple owns it and they have turned a regular dirt lot into an awesome tropical nursery. They also live on the property and have taken in many stray dogs that now live a happy life there.The lady took time to show us around. Her tropical trees and plants are very impressive. I learned so much from her just in half an hour. She has banana, mango, and other tropical and unsual plants there so make sure to stop by and support this local business if you are in the area.
5	I can't wait to go back for my next tropical tree.My Mango tree has been added to the collection and she looks amazing. This place is awesome its as if I traveled to a different state. The amount of tropical trees makes it hard to just pick one. Those of you who visit beware of the white ducks they will follow you and bite your pants haha. Kim and Dan Thanks for all the help.
