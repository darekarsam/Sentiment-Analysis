4	It used to be a bank branch and has a drive -thru window :-)  I love the egg-white/turkey sausage sandwich on flatbread. And the coffee is pretty good too. the service is very quick. Haven't had any donuts.. yet.
5	I like this Dunkin Donuts. The employees are always polite and nice even in the wee early hours when they are most probably wanting to be in bed asleep. They have speedy service and I don't think you can beat their prices for actual good coffee unlike that other "big coffee chain".
5	I go here daily for coffee and the employees are super friendly! Had a stranger buy my coffee once and one employee actually remembers how I take my coffee! Blueberry cake donuts aren't too bad either!
4	Stopped by for a donut and an ice tea. All went well. Way better than the location close to me. Waiting was minimal and my order was correct. No actual complaints other than employees were short and didn't really Interact but not a huge deal.
4	Very nice worker's. The coffee is always fresh. I never have to wait .very prompt service.
5	I go out of my way to work for this location! The employees are fast and friendly. Great way to start the morning!
4	Was just there for 2 holiday flavor latee's. Both were Luke warm  and weak until we got to the bottom of the cup. Then all the syrup was laying in the bottom. For some reason it didn't get mixed. Back to Starbucks for me now.
5	When we are in the mood for Dunkin' Donuts we go to this location. It is very clean, the drive-thru is well run, and the staff is very friendly.
5	Absolutely love this location! I have tried other DD locations but they never get my coffee right. I use the drive thru almost every day and no matter how long the line is the clerks are always pleasant. I choose this over the 3 Starbucks I pass everyday. Good prices, great coffee, and wonderful clerks!
