2	This place seems perfectly fine as you peruse the grain section. Then I strolled through the produce section, which really should be the pride and joy of a store like this. The produce section is the core of a healthy diet - and this is a health food store. However, the blackberries were a little wrinkled. The salad a bit brown. I thought however I scored by getting 2 for 1 on avocados. They were not mushy, they had good color. When I cut into them at home, they were MOLDY and spongy and black and disgusting. ALL of them. Gross!!! I now wonder if I should eat the buckwheat from their shop - can buckwheat go bad???They also had Dr Bronner's castille soup which I love. Their bottles however where cloudy. I have NEVER seen a cloudy bottle of Dr Bronners and I have seen a lot of them (they have it at Trader Joes in San Francisco where I used to live). These bottles must have been there for years! I am not going back there - for anything. It's like the owner forgot he owned the store and never comes by. It is neglected big time! Yuck!
1	They just lost another client...I am not a regular but I do purchase from them some items now and then. I just passed by to buy some of the meat substitute, made of soy protein and since I could not remember where it was I asked the clerk. The price was 1.99 as a special, down from 4.99, I made the comment that it was cheap, and the guy grabbed all the packages and went bonkers, and right in front of me started yelling and calling some girl "dumb" and ripped off all the labels with the 1.99 price, I asked what the real price was and he answered it was 4.99...I put the package down and walked out...zero professionalism, zero customer service...zero everything. Stay away if you can
