4	This store is located inside the Miracle Mile Shops in Planet Hollywood Hotel on the strip. I particularly have a fond memory of this store because they have a very cute Elvis white jumpsuit for the stuffed animals. It even has a black wig and of course the famous sunglasses to go with it. If you are not fond of Elvis, the $6 jeweled tees with Las Vegas on it is a good souvenir choice. The selection of the stuffed animals are quite limited here because the store is not big, but it is still fun for the kids to look around especially this mall doesn't seem to have any other stores tailored for kids.
5	Been planning since Sarah was 4 months, for us to take baby to get his 1st teddy at build a bear. The staff is very helpful and walked us through their process since it was our first time. We wil definitely be coming here every holiday for baby because of their customer service and their product.
5	Always a fun and happy place to be in.   The staff are helpful and friendly. You can make your own fun loving bear for your special someone
