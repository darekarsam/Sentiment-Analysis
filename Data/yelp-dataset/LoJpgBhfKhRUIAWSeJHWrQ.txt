5	PERFECT NIGHT STARTER OR CLOSERThe business does absolutely everything right, from the fun ever-changing upbeat music, absolutely great prices to the perfectly attentive service. The clientele can be a bit mixed, which makes it interesting. THE AMBIANCEBlacklights, projectors over the DJs, music that'll let you carry a relatively normal conversation, and enough hookahs to go around. Very clean venue, short lines at restrooms, and really fun music that can go from old-school hip hop to the latest electronica/world jam. Switching back and forth from a relaxing state to a euphoric party-mode, just like a hookah bar should. THE FOODVery decent, so are the drinks.THE PRICEExtremely moderate, starting at around 9$ a hookah, there's no reason not to check at least one out, heck, at that price, go for a couple. I recommend the gummy bears flavor, and grape without mint. THE SERVICEAttentive, quick, and extremely friendly. They will make you feel first-class every time. THE FIFTH STARI will give them the benefit of the doubt because it's a fairly new venue, and although they've wowed me for a few weeks in a row, I only wish they would turn the music a bit louder, kept menus available at all times, and added more back-rests. Other than that, can't be missed.
5	Great place to go! Extremely relaxing atmosphere, hookahs are delicious, and employees accommodate to any needs! 5 stars!
