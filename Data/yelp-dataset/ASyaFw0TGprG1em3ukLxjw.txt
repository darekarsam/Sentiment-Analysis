1	They used to be delicious. I live right around the corner, and our family would eat there all the time when we wanted a quick dinner and didn't want to have to make it at home. The last two times I have been there though, it has been horrible. The service is horrible, the people are rude, and I actually got sick the last two times I ate there. The first time I got sick I didn't realize it was the food. I thought I just had a stomach bug and it wasn't nearly as bad as the second time I got sick. The very next time after that I got very sick again. It was one of the worst food poisoning I've had since I was a kid. There also seems to be a foul smell inside, a mixture between them not cleaning out their grease traps properly, raw sewage, and a dirty restaurant with mildew floors. As far as the rude service goes, my friend and I were ordering take out a while back, and my buddy thought he had paid the whole balance, but apparently he was off by 10 dollars which was purely accident. The lady in the front started yelling at us and freaking out, acting like we were robbing her or something and like we did it on purpose. Shouldn't treat customers this way, and if you value your health I strongly suggest staying away this place.
