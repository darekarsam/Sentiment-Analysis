3	The poutine was very mediocre, but the steamed hot dogs were amazing, especially the coleslaw that goes on top of them.
3	best steamy in the neighborhood! not hard to achieve as there's basically no viable fast food joints around (la belle province doesn't count).and its pretty inexpensive too. place has a diner feel to it. there's 2 entrance, front and via the parking area in the back.the fries are just ok as are most items. pretty disappointing.service is fast food service, fast and friendly enough
3	This place is more of a one time thing...!! The subs are delicious but the combos are expensive. They give you a tiny portion of fries that are not bad but not the best, with a little plastic cup of pepsi...!! For a 6inch combo its almost 10$ with taxes and for 10inch its around 15$, all this served on carton plates...!! If I'm gonna pay a little more than any regular Sub places(including Subway) I at least expect a regular can of pepsi in my combo with regular plates. Like I said, its a one time experience for the Subs but that it!
