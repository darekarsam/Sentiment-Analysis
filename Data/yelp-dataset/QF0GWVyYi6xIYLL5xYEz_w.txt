4	I came to this family-owned business (some years ago), located behind 7-11 in the little strip mall, several times for jewelry repair (it was close to work at the time). I have a beautiful white gold diamond bracelet from Zales that has a clasp which keeps coming loose. (In fact, it's loose again.) The owners are brothers, who are very nice, and they do quality work. It's a small store- you get buzzed in, for obvious security reasons. I do remember seeing some lovely tanzanite jewelry (one of my favorites but it's pricey).
5	I needed to fix a silver link on my wife's necklace. I found the store inYelp near my location. I walked in, they fixed it in 5 mins and I was out the door very pleased.
5	Lou does amazing work and quality repairs.  Pricing is transparant and fair.
5	A good place, low pressure sales. Prices are fair. I felt good going in there with no particular gift to buy or nothing on my list and browse.  The quality of the jewelry in there is 100x's better than what you might find at a mall jewelry store.  When you want to shop and browse, this friendly place is great.
5	Went to this place strictly under Yelp review and it was right on point.Although the first time I went it was closed with some odd signage about the opening and closing hours for the summer. I went to get my Tiffany's cross pendant fixed that I'd originally gotten estimated at $50 just to get a chain put back together, when the lady at the counter told me that I looked at her and told her right to her face, you've got to be kidding me right? $50 to fix a $100 necklace, that's a ripoff. The owner fixed it for me for $10, and was very courteous and professional the entire time. This is a great place to go to and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs to get their jewelry fixed.
