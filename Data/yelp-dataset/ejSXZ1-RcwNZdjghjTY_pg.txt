4	You can tell that RP's pasta is high quality...the taste is definitely superior.  We especially love their raviolis, with various fillings like the four cheese or spinach and ricotta.  I prefer to buy at the farmer's market,  where it is 2 for $10, though you can get it at different grocery stores for a bit more $.
5	Great restaurant style pasta. Delivered to your home or available at some local gluten free retailers. Nice option for a gluten free menu. Almost indistinguishable from wheat based pastas.
5	Thank You, RP's Pasta for refining and providing excellent gluten-free pasta!  I was exstatic to find your gluten-free lasagna sheets packaged for retail!  My lasagna is in the oven right now!  I choose to eat gluten-free.  i appreciate your tenacity in providing gluten-free, fresh pasta at an affordable price.  I also appreciate you for working with retailers to meet their needs!  I worked with you to source gluten-free lasagna sheets for my gluten-free customers at Hy-vee.  Your staff is always professional.  I appreciate your personal interaction.  I will always recommend your pastas, gluten-free or not because you are a company of integrity.
3	Best GF pasta we have found...and we've tried many! The only HUGE problem we had was the fettucini and linguini, which say to cook for 2, 3 min stick together in a huge clumpy mess!! The fusilli is amazing and as close to wheat pasta as we have ever found but we'll never guy the linguini or fettucini again ever! Even after cooking for about 6 min it was not cooked and totally stuck together. So disappointing. Would love other small shapes that don't stick.
