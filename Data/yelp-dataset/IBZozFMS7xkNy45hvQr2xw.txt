2	This place puts the guilty in guilty pleasure. There will always be a special place in my heart for cheap, greasy chicken, but here the free sample is enough to remind me that there are better options. The noodles were gross, and the egg rolls seemed to have spent to much time in the fryer. The broccoli was OK, but not good enough to make me want to eat here again.
2	Ehh, the fried rice was alright I suppose, it was edible and the mixed vegetables were decent I suppose. Though the sesame chicken didn't have any Sesame's on it, in fact it looked like and tasted like general tso's chicken, so overall not happy. Quality of food is what can be expected at a food court so I feel I can't really hold it against them, but seriously, I should have just went to an actual restaurant.
3	Famous Wok is located in the Food Court of the Outlets at Anthem in Arizona.  Family was hungry, and they wanted rice.  This was the best option of the choices available.The combo with fried rice, mixed vegetables, and bourbon chicken was okay.  About what I would expect from a place at a food court.  Did not have high expectations so there was no disappointment here.  Price was okay.  Service was great.Don't know if I would choose this place again.  I'm sure the rest of the family would though.
