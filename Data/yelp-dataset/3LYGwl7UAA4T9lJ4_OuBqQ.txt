4	Tried this place after my fiance raved about it. The food was pretty good. We got some chicken platters and the chicken comes fresh off of a spit and the rice and hummus was amazing. Service was very friendly and the food is all halal. Price was very fair as well. Would definitely come back here.
2	Shawarmas/shishtaouks are great. Everyone knows this. I've been to this place a lot it's good. But, last time I was there there were 3 teens working. They were whispering a lot and the service was super slow. I don't know what they did to my sandwich but it was terrible and somehow it was super watery. Haven't been back since.
