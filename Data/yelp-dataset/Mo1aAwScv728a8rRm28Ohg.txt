4	A little bit of Plaza Midwood and Noda rolled into a coffee house near Southend! If you need your caffeine fix in the Sedgefield/Scaleybark area you may want to check out this little gem. They feature popular lattes and cappuccinos and they have almond milk! Sandwiches, soups and salads are tasty especially the turkey with a kale & spinach spread. There is a party room in the back and a small stage in the front for performances and they also serve Tropicalsno shaved ice! Try the Georgia Peach you can't go wrong!
5	Hooray! An funky little coffee and desert joint in my neighborhood with late hours. The staff is kind and the concept is upbeat. I'll definitely return.
5	Oh my gosh I love this place!  Totally laid back.  Sarrah, The owner has never met an enemy and if you want to talk, she has the most interesting stories to tell!  Of course she is busy slinging coffee much of the time.  This is truly what a coffee shop should be!  Come to the "Friends" coffee shop in Charlotte.  You will be back that is for sure!
5	Great energy, great owner! The atmosphere is easy and laid back, and the coffee is fabulous!
