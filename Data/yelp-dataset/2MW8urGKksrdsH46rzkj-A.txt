4	Love the limeade.  The new hot dogs taste great, and actually look like the pictures you see on the ads.  How often does that happen?
4	With all the shakes and drinks you can order how can you not rate Sonic at least 4 stars right? I used to BINGE on Sonic when I would come home on leave because they didnt have it where I was stationed. Now that I've served my time and I'm back home I've taken this wonderful place for granted! I'm sorry Sonic and I'm yelping to make my ammends! Chocolate Malt FTW!!
2	I have been to this Sonic location a number of times over the past year and a half.  Normally, the service is okay.  A little slow, but most Sonic's are so I get it.Plus two stars because, hello... cheeseburgers. My main complaints:Incorrect Orders: This I can overlook.  They don't always screw up my order, but when they do I'm too lazy to turn around and go back.  Obviously I'm lazy - I'm eating at Sonic!  However, this is a fast food chain and when are places like this not screwing something up?  Minus zero stars because screwing up orders is like part of their identity or something. Bug in My Food: Last year I found a huge (to me, I'm a baby when it comes to bugs) flying ant in my tator tots.  Yuck.  Minus one star because bugs are gross but I'm still a reasonable person.  It's not like it went in my mouth or anything. Nail Clipping in My Slush: Who doesn't love a Lemon Berry Slush?  Me. Now.  Ever since this weekend when I sucked up a nail clipping that is.  Yes, a nail clipping.  In my mouth.  Minus two stars because it touched my insides.  And it was yellow-ish and unkempt. No more, Sonic.  No more.  Keep your bugs and bits of body parts to yourself.Note: As of this writing, this location is closed and roped off.  What did other people find this weekend?
