5	So grateful for these caring professionals. Thorough and excellent care for my boy Moses, including follow up care. Dr Joanna Norman,  surgeon,  Dr.  Reed DVD & their assistant, Deb, I only wish I had this quality of health care for the rest of my family. Happy to drive wherever they are.
5	Dr Joanna Norman is absolutely fantastic! Such a great doctor...you can feel how much she cares within the first couple of minutes. Her staff, Kym & Heather, were positively professional & helpful, beyond words. I hope my fur baby never has another eye issue, but if he does, I know where I'm going!
5	I have been meaning to comment here based on the experience we had few months back. We took our Shih Tzu in because he had lost vision in his left eye. Dr Norman treated our dog and had us give him drops and medication for 2 month and ouir dog regained at least 95% of his vision back, it was due to dry eye. We are so grateful for the kindness and help, they really have improved our dogs life and ours.
