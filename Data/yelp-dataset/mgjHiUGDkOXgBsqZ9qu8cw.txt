1	I called them for a simple repair to my pool pump on a Tuesday. They indicated that they might be able to get to it late in the week. They took all my credit card information and said they would call. They never did. I called a competitor today who was able to come today and they fixed it for $20 less than B&C's quoted rate.
5	We recently bought a house where the pool has been "neglected" (and that's putting it mildly).  The pump ran with no visible suction, we were CONSTANTLY shocking to pool to keep it clear, and don't even get me started on backwashing the filter...  We got quotes from 3 other pool care companies to get us up and running again, but only Bright and Clear gave us a straight-forward and honest assessment of our situation, working with us to come up with a plan of attack to prioritize our repairs/remodels on our budget.  They have been fantastic through the repair and installation process and, thanks to them, we won't have a mosquito-ridden cess pool in our backyard this summer!!!  THANK YOU MacKenzie, Denise, and Adam - you all are FANTASTIC!!!
5	Very happy with this service. After buying this house our old pool guy felt this pool was to big for him to handle. We had a little trouble with appts in the beginning but after the first month, everything has been great. Pool looks very good every week. They always keep me informed of things I may need to update or need of repairs, and then follow that up with not only a phone call from the main office, but a email.The office staff has been very friendly and helpful.I am happy with my weekly service and feel their price is very comparable to other pool services that offer FULL service.
