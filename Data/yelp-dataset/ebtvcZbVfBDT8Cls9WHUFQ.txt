5	The Kitchen Connection is a full service design/build remodeling company, specializing in kitchen and bathroom remodels.The Kitchen Connection is an amazing family-run company that practices integrity with every piece of the execution process. The thing I love most about the Kitchen Connection is the fact that they are open to what you need, and do not sell more than that.  The designer, Debbie Nowaczyk, is sweet, kind, and knowledgeable.  She has many years of remodeling experience, and this shows with her follow up and management of contractors.  She even is an active real estate agent, which is an incredible value in terms of her recommendations of ROI on your remodel investment.  Her sons - Tom and Jeromie - are on-site and deeply involved every step of the actual remodeling labor. They go above and beyond, without nickel-and-diming you.  What a great team, and what a great family!
5	I have absolutely LOVED every aspect of working with The Kitchen Connection. Tom and team were incredible throughout the whole process. Tom provided a detailed estimate and ensured I was informed of all of the costs and options up front. I felt informed and updated throughout the whole project.Debbie was able to take my vision for my space and turn it into a reality with her design expertise. I could not be more thrilled with the entire process and the end result. I absolutely LOVE the team at Kitchen Connection, and refer them to all my friends and family.
5	Kitchen Connection just completed our kitchen remodel last month and were done within two weeks. They were thorough, reliable, friendly, and even worked on Sundays. I can't say enough about how awesome they were. I have a 2 year old and a 4 year old and their patience with them and their millions of questions was also amazing! I plan on using then for ALL my home updates! They have a customer and friend for life with the Wesolowskis :)
