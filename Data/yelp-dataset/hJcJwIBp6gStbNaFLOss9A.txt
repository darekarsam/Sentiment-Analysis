3	This place is sooo Italian. Italian music, Italian paraphernalia all over the walls, Italian staff... Very casual and relaxed atmosphere.We ordered a couple of pasta dishes, ravioli and spaghetti and they were both good. The portions are fair in size and are presented in cool frying pans - neat idea!.Service was fast - we got our food right away and when we needed more bread, they brought it to our table in no time.Casual, simple and good, can't go wrong when you're looking to get a quick pasta fix :)Cash and debit only - no credit cards.
5	My family of four had dinner tonight at Da Enrico.  It was fabulous.  Best food we have had in Montreal during our trip so far.  We each ordered something different and each meal was great.  The veal parmesan was really nice, and the homemade marinara sauce that they put on the pasta on the side was light and fresh and non-acidic.  The Rigatoni with tres formaggi was awesome as well.  The spaghetti with Carbonara sauce was actually light and flavorful, not too rich.  The chef didn't use cream with the sauce - just flash-cooked the egg and broth to create a creamy sauce.  The pizza was pretty good as well.  Bring your own bottle of wine, and have a great time.
1	The strolling musicians were pleasant. It was a beautiful, mild summer night and sitting on a terrasse sharing a fine Italian red wine with good friends was so lovely. That was the best thing about our evening.  Slow, understaffed service. The antipasti appetizer was good though missing some menu items  such as  the Giardiniera Di Lequmi.  Pastas were just passable and I couldn't eat more than half of my Calabrese pizza - it tasted like those frozen things I avoid.  Dessert & coffee were presented on the house - nice touch but  we won't return. We were among many patrons that had taken advantage of the coupon deal.  Don't bother - pass this one by.
