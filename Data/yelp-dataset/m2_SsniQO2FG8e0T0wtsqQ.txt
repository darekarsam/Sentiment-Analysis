1	I hate this place. Overpriced, limited selection.
2	This grocery store gets 2 stars just for being open 24 hours.  I only shop there if it's after midnight (when the other grocery stores in the area have closed). - overpriced- very annoying security 'guys' follow you around the store- limited selection
