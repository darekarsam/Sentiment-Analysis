4	I will never be into surfer style for two reasons, Firstly, I'm not gnarly enough, and secondly, flip-flops make me physically sick. I honestly can't even look at them, far less wear them, and seeing a set of mouldy, yellow toenails poking out from a pair is up there with my very worst nightmares.It's not all surfwear though, not even mostly surfwear, but my inherent prejudices always seem to prevent me from spending too much time in Fat Face. There's actually a few decent polo shirts and t-shirts, admittedly all in various shades of khaki brown, and various other bits, bobs and accessories on offer for those that like travelling on boards of some sort.
4	Fat Face is for the those of us who like to go on walks and have dreadlocks..kinda. It's sort of a indie, hippie shop but with gorgeous fashions and really beautiful patterned dresses. We all have a friend who is into that sort of stuff, right?  It's for the surf-short-wearing, quicksilver-bikini type kid in all of us!This shop is laid out well and the staff are really super duper. They are friendly and annoyingly cool. It's pretty reasonable too, but maybe a bit on the expensive side. Worth a looky look though!
