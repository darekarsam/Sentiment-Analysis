3	Had dinner by myself here.  Other guests are latin-american (a good indicator).Had ceviche and a glass of white wine.  Great!Small pastry as a dessert:  excellent, light, sweet.  Coffee was great.Recommend.
5	I've been there many times and I've never been disappointed. They have all the Salvadorian specialties you'd expect, and everything is delicious. Staff is very friendly and you really feel immersed in the culture. I especially recommand the pupusas and the ceviche. Careful though, they're not open all week and it can be a long wait if you're a group.
