5	AMAZING !!!! This team of doctors ( Dr Frielander) is wonderful , that make you feel a part of the team and really do treat you like family !!!! He has so much passion for his work and compassion for his patients , i highly recommend then to anyone !!!! :)
5	Dr. Larson and his office were wonderful to deal with! Very knowledgeable and courteous!  Came in for medicine for my daughter's foot after a consult with Dr. Larson and felt he was very honest and had my daughter's best interest in mind (and not his pocketbook). Will definitely refer to anyone!
1	Good doctor but horrible staff and service. Left a message about medication and never received a call back. When speaking with one of the receptionists you feel like a bother instead of a patient from the short impersonal responses. Also to top it off was told that my two visits would be lumped together as one and was not the case when I came to the office and they went back on their words. Would recommend another practice if you want a more personal feel.
5	If you are looking for great foot care, this is where to go!  From diabetic foot care to complex surgery, you are in great hands.  The staff is professional but personable.  I had a major foot surgery with excellent results.  Your feet will be in good hands!
