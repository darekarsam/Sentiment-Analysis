4	The Greener Apple is located in Book Buyers, a Plaza Midwood used book store.  It features Eco-conscious items, such as household cleaners and vegan foods.  Lee, who is the daughter of the gentleman who owns the book store, is the bubbly proprietress of The Greener Apple.  The store also features Page, a lovely tuxedo cat that unfortunately, we are warned not to pet.  And, on a funnier note, we are advised not to call Page "fat" or ask if she s pregnant.  Anyway, hats off to The Greener Apple and Book Buyers for giving Page a loving, safe home.  Recently, I purchased vegan marshmallows and chocolate for s'mores.  Lee chipped in two delicious flax bars as well!  Not only are the products that one would feel good about purchasing, but Lee's consistent friendliness is a draw as well.  I just wish that she would let me pet Page.....
5	There aren't too many Charlotte stores that have Eco-friendly offerings. Housed inside of an amazing used book store, Book Buyers, the Greener Apple has everything from vegan treats and raw chapstick to Eco-conscious laundry detergent and recyclable sandwich containers. Must check out this charming little spot!
5	I love this place! They have amazing vegan options that you really just can't get anywhere else in Charlotte. I love the cat that hangs out there, but even more, I love the coconut bacon :)
