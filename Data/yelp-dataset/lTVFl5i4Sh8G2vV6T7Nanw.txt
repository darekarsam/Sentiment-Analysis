2	Why do they charge so much to use credit cards?  I don't usually carry cash and its annoying having to have to pay so much because of plastic.  I love Baskin and Robbins.  Its nostalgic for me actually and this one is near my home but come on, I have to go to  the ATM  because some times they don't even accept credit cards.
