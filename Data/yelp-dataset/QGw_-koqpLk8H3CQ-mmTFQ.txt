5	BIG BIG Thanks to the manager Henry and the rest of the guys at Water Heater Depot!!  I was searching on Craigslist for ceiling fans and ran across a posting for Water Heater Depot.  This place is seriously a great find!  It looks to be mostly scratch & dent, returns, and overstock from H/D.  We walk in and Henry greets us immediately and asks us what we're looking for.  We tell him we're needing a ceiling fan and he walks us over to the shelf they were on.  The only indoor ones left were missing parts.  BUT he thought he knew of one in another part of the shop.  He comes back with a fan that was a floor model with all parts still in the box.  Price - $35.  HD's price - $90.   I seriously know where we will be returning when we're ready to purchase items when we remodel!!  :)We shall be back!!!
2	Prices look good but I've been there 3 times and had MAJOR issues getting assistance, when I do get it, the prices are not the 50% off advertised, in some cases they only knock off 20-30% from retail. More often than not there are generally pieces missing or the item is damaged. Many of the faucets I looked at and bought didn't have stoppers, also the lighting I purchased was missing the mounting bracket. These are things I would not normally see when I examine the item in the store. Other lighting I wanted I had insisted on opening before purchasing and thank goodness I did since the fixtures were bent up beyond repair.
5	Awesome place for dys. Amazing prices and the best customer service I have ever received. I go there quite often on my way home from work and have gotten to know the staff quite well. If you buy something that is broken they are very helpful and willing to help you fix it and find replacement parts.
