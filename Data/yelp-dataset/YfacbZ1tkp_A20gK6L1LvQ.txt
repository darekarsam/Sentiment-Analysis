4	One of my favorite places to shop.  They have high end clothes for good prices.  The selection could be better, but it is decent.  They also have home goods too.  This is usually the first place I go to shop for clothes.
3	Overall, the store seems to cater to the older, more mature crowd of women so it took some looking to find things that I found stylish and could see myself wearing. Major bonus? They have a great selection of Se7en Jeans right now and I was able to find a pair for $31.99! They have other departments as well-mens, home decor, shoes, etc
5	My love affair with this store began when I lived in Ohio but it was far from home, so needless to say I was beyond thrilled to find one just 3 miles away from our new place! High quality clothing and housewares at affordable prices. I shop the sale racks for even deeper discounts :) It is clean, organized, and it's nice to be greeted with a warm hello each time I've entered the store.
