5	High end competitive training for those serious about their jiu jitsu.. at the same time.. is gentle enough for the weekend warrior... great place to train!
5	This is simply the BEST place to roll when you're in Las Vegas. First time visitor?  You are already family. Learn something new?  Absolutely. Drill the familiar?  Absolutely. Concerned about safety?  Always. Men, women, children, young or old, ALL are welcomed as practitioners. This is one of the BEST places to help start your child's understanding of his/her own jiu jitsu. I live in Los Angeles. I make frequent, purposeful trips to Vegas, so I can learn and grow with these folks. Go see Brian Glenn and Ronda Andrews. They'll introduce you to the rest of the family.
5	Best BJJ team!! A lot of talented practitioners; clean gym; everybody treats everyone like family here. Go team Mica!!
5	Because of this gym and team, I've learned so much more than just BJJ and self defense.  Training here has taught me more about myself than I could ever explain.  And that's what a real team is about.  The friends I have made training with Gracie Humaita Las Vegas will last a life time.  Gym is awesome and clean, instructors are amazing, and the Jiu-Jitsu and other classes are as good as it gets.  Come join the best team  around! GRACIE HUMAITA LAS VEGAS!
5	Good relaxing atmostphere for anyone from the serious competitor to the casual trainer.  Mica is very encouraging, understanding and will usually listen you if you have injuries or are cautious to train and modify your partners.  Very big family environment and always laughing going on which means egos are not involved.
5	Your search for a jiujitsu family end here, and your life with them begins now- TEAM MICA is the truth!
