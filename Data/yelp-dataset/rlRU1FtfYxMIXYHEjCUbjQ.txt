5	Super fresh seafood in Plaza Midwood - yeah!  They have been selling at the Common Market all summer and now have their own brick and mortar.  We've had so much tasty fish from them in recent months - wreckfish, flounder, shrimp, halibut, tilefish, clams.  The fish is so tasty - you just need a little salt and pepper and that's it. Almost all of it is from the Carolina coast.  Now they're selling Duke's Bread and Dover Farms produce and they're about to team up with Pasta and Provisions!  They've fulfilled my dream of coming home after work and stopping for super fresh local seafood for an incredible dinner. This is one of the best additions to Charlotte in quite some time.  Wishing them lots of success!
5	Absolutely awesome addition to the hood.  Loved the seafood we'd grab Saturday on the common market patio.  So glad they got a store.  Everything i have gotten is super fresh.   I look forward to watching another neighborhood owned business grow before my eyes!!Kudos and keep it up.
5	I NOW HAVE A NEIGHBORHOOD SEAFOOD MARKET! I kept walking by what I thought was a sports bar at the corner of Commonwealth and Pecan. BUT NO - turns out it's an actual seafood market. Sean has on hand fin fish, oysters, scallops, mussels, shrimp - all very fresh. Put your name on their email list for what they have available as well as specials (such as 50 cent oyster day.) Do not expect bargain basement prices but keep in mind what it takes to get seafood brought in to Charlotte from all along the Atlantic coast without freezing. Last night my son and I enjoyed some wreckfish brought in from Charleston. It was wonderful. A neighbor had their oysters at a party last Saturday - sweet, sweet.Support our newest neighbors - they do a good job at Catch On Seafood.
