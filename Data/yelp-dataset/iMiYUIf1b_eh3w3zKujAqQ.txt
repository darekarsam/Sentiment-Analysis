5	Cheap and very friendly!
5	Without a doubt, this is the cleanest gas station around. The staff are friendly, courteous, and I freakin' love their beer selection. Keep up the great work!
1	Without a doubt, this gas station and it's constituents are the definition of white-trash. They constantly barrage customers with their own faulty opinions and make the paying people feel uneasy and awkward. Going into this place of business is definitely the worst part of anybody's day that lives in the area.
