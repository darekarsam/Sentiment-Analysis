5	Nice staff, cheap smokes. We always come here!
3	Come here to get hookah and cigars from time to time. Cool guy runs. Typical smoke shop once youve seen one you've seen em all
1	Owner is a profit driven douchebag hey nothing wrong with hustling but he hustles in a rude thoughtless way..asked him to start carrying " sage" incents every time I go in and he refuses to even acknowledge the request..
1	The owner (pakistani guy) is just so rude and he always change his prices. Just so u know guys they don't put tag prices on they're vape and e-liquids so they can change it everytime they want. Zero star would be the accurate rate for this store.
5	The guy there, I think it's the owner, is very knowledgeable and friendly compared to other smoke shops in the neighborhood. Prices are reasonable and he does give some free stuff if you're a regular there. I do all my hookah purchases here
