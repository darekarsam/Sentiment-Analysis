5	My gf and I went in here the other day pretty much on a whim.  Its a great little place.  The girl working was very nice and friendly and made us feel welcome.  My gf found a jacket that she loves.  We also got a pretty sweet candle.
5	I have worked with the owner of this boutique over the past year during her gallery and truck shows, and modeled one of her designs during pittsburgh fashion week. She is one of the nicest desingers I have ever worked with and the store is amazing!! Decently priced and very unique items. Keep up the good work, Kari!
