5	It is fast and easy
1	We got a sandwich about an hour ago and couldn't even eat it, it was horrible.  The bread tasted like it was a week old.  It literally broke apart, it was so stale.  I called and spoke to Dawn who could have cared less.  She never even said she was sorry.  She said the manager was not there and all she said when I told her how bad the bread was.... Oh !!!!  Very poor customer service.
2	Probably the worse subway I have eaten at. The bread on 3 sandwiches we ordered was stale and falling apart. Service was slow and the restroom was scary. I was very disappointed with this visit.  Subway is eaten often, not sure I'll ever come back to this one.
1	Really skimpy on to toppings. Rude customer service. Check out person was on the phone during the entire transaction. I avoid this subway.
