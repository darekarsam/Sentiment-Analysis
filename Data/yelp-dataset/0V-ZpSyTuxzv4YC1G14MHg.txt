5	Costumer service is professional and personable. If you call Danny early enough he will get their and have your A/C running in no time..Very honest individual who has integrity and treats your A/C as if it was in his own home. Very reasonable and wont charge as much as big commercial businesses. I was very happy and felt that I wasn't taken advantage of when he left...Finally a good night sleep, Thanks Cold-Air Mechanics...DANNYYY!!!! LICENSE BONDED AND INSURED
5	I cannot say enough good stuff about Dan with Cold-air mechanics.  he came out on a moments notice. I found Danny from a friend of mine and have to say I'm glad I gave Danny a call.  My rental property called and said the upstairs AC was not working.  Within 2 hours Danny was the the house and had a diagnosis.  he was able to save the downstairs ac.  He gave it a good service and put 3 lbs of freon in it.  He said the upstairs ac was on its last leg but I might get some more time out of it.  We got about a week.  When it died a week later Dan was out the same day and replaced the bad parts for about 40% less then what I had been quoted a couple weeks earlier by Roberts AC.  Dan stayed till about 11pm getting the new A/c up and running.  Then he followed up the next day with my tenants.  During that follow up he discovered there was a problem with the thermostat for which he went there immediately to adjust.  I felt immediate trust with Dan which doesn't come easy for me.  He really does what ever it takes.  I've since used him to service my two other properties and everytime he is on his game.  Thanks
5	I have to agree with with the other reviews about Danny.  He came out on time in a days notice and took great care of my AC unit.  Just a cleaning and new freon and we are back in business.  Thank you Danny
