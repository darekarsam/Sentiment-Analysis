4	Besides the gym, the mall is probably my second favorite place to get my exercise on. Well, that is before I sabotage it with carby goodness. The food court is filled with pitfalls waiting to snag it's next victim. Auntie Anne's would not be so bad until you see them brush a generous application of butter on top. With such a critical opinion of their practice, why would I give them such a high rating? Sometimes counting calories and nitpicking is a buzz kill. The cinnamon sugar pretzel is the answer to a sweet tooth. The pepperoni twist is like having all crust with pieces of meat. Some of the more popular items are made ahead of time, but I was told it would take six minutes for mine. Maybe the pizza inspired bread does not sit well and I am glad to have it come out fresh.
4	Good pretzels, though I am convinced the pretzel "game" is a racket.
4	Strawberry lemonade and pretzel sticks with marinara sauce, everytime.
4	I haven't had an Auntie Anne's pretzel since 2001 - when I was 6 - before I moved to Canada. My dad worked at a Florida mall with an Auntie Anne's right across from his kiosk, so I would get one every time I visited him at work. Toronto does not have Auntie Anne's, and no pretzel place here has lived up to Auntie Anne's. We were here a few days ago while visiting Vegas, and this was a taste of my childhood. The jalapeno pretzel tasted just as good as the ones I would have over a decade ago, and it was made fresh. The only complaint I have is that the jalapenos were left whole, whereas before they used to mix little pieces in with the dough; some bites tasted like normal pretzel, while other bites were spicy as fuck. Overall, I wish I could come here everyday.
5	MEDULLA OBLONGATA HOOKED Great place to grab a cup of freshly made mini pretzel dogs. It's a high volume franchise and their pretzels are uber hot and fresh. Yu-go is hooked to their mini pretzel dogs dipped in their sweet honey mustard.
