4	Yes... I know Jack in the Box is a fast food place, but it's hard not to like it.  Their menu is very extensive so it isn't just limited to burgers and fries-Many of the fast food places are starting to offer some healthier choices, so at least that's a change for the good.I usually just go here once in a while- maybe once every 3 months when I'm in a rush to grab some food while running errands during lunch or just don't have time to sit down and have a decent lunch break.  The staff here is very friendly and efficient, normally your food (cooked to order) comes out really quickly.  The dining room is kept really clean.I haven't used the drive through, but it seems to move a lot of people through from what I have observed while eating there.
4	Had a bad experience at Long John Silvers walked out with no food. I told my wife lets just go to Jack. This specific Jack never disappoints. Can't say they have never messed up my order but over all they care about giving you a good eating exerience. There are some really good people that work at this restaurant.
5	Every time I come here the staff is always friendly. I usually have a huge order, but they smile and joke around with me about it. My last order was 22 tacos and a shake. The food is always hot and never stale. Thanks to the staff here!  They also have a military discount, so thank you to Jack for supporting the armed services. Active and retired.
1	This place is disscuting  my son got food poisoning when I called the store mgr Alex brushed it off. His employees don't think highly of him either. Maybe corporate needs to check on his mgnmt & customer service skills
1	Horrible both my sons & husband had gotten food poisoning none of us will ever go back!
