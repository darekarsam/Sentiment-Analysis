2	Got some carne asada for dinner tonight from La Palma. The meat was good quality but I wasn't too impressed with the marinade they use.The marinade was pretty bland and didn't really add much to the meat. However, the price was decent compared to some so I guess it's a trade off.Also, I was a bit disappointed with the guy cashier today. He couldn't stop running his trap to a friend, in Spanish, and take the time to devote his attention to me, a customer.Meh, I've experienced better.
5	The food is sooooo gooood I can't wait tall I go back get same more you should try chicken fajitas oh yeah get my word it's fresh food
3	There's a taqueria counter inside for your taco and nachos fix, but steer clear o their produce- it looks like it's seen better days. There is seafood and a butcher, with pre-marinaded meats for asadas and fajitas, as well as seafood and ceviche. Huge seasoning selection, as well as fresh mexican cheeses.Pricing is mostly on the low to reasonable end, with the taqueria counter being the best bargain: steer clear of the lengua and chicken, but the carnitas and asada are good quality. Menudo is available on weekends, breakfast burritos for $3, and the nachos are enough to feed a family for only $5. Counts against them that their "fresh" guac is brown, though.
