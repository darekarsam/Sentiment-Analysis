5	This is my Quiktrip. I'm the Duke, the business photo is mine, and this is their first review, so I'm the boss. Come on in and enjoy some inexpensive gas, coffee, snacks, and 5 Hour Energy drinks! Quiktrips are the best convenience store/gas station in the valley.
5	Close, convenient, clean, and cheap.  The four Cs get five stars.
5	friendly and fast service!
5	I have never been to a QuikTrip that I didn't love!  This QT has the famous 'QT Kitchen!'  As we walked in, and started to browse the kitchen menu, and an employee walked up to me and basically introduced it to me!  This QuikTrip is super busy, but you won't even notice, because they can get you in and out like a freaking lightning bolt.
5	I'm actually loving their new kitchen with food made to order. just tried the hazelnut iced latte and its not too bad. Staff is friendly,  store is always clean. I go out of my way to this location for work.
5	Great speedy service! The staff is always friendly and the place is spotless. They have the best prices in town on gas and other product.
5	I kind of hate quick trip - only because my boyfriend loves it so darn much. He drags me there regularly.  No normal human being should ever need to go to the gas station as often as he does. That being said,  this gas station does not deserve a bad rating because my boyfriend is obsessed with them.  Truthfully, it is a nice gas station.  It's clean.  The service is always quick,  and the gas prices are usually reasonable compared to the competition.
