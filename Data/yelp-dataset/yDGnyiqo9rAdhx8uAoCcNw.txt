5	Just bought a few ounces of silver. They definitely have the best spot prices in the area
1	Run as fast as you can. Today I went into E.D. Marshalls to sell a necklace so that I could make my mortgage payment. I had been hit hard financially this month and had to make the hard decision to sell a necklace that was dear to me. Not only did the gentleman offer me a ridiculous amount, he informed me that he gets a lot of unscrupulous would be clients. I do not know why he felt that I needed to know about his clientele, but I found his behavior offensive and suspect. So the bottom line is that he offered me half the amount that other local businesses were offering and his professionalism left a lot to be desired.
5	I came into this place and they were very friendly they have lots to choose from. I love this place they accommodate their customers very well I will recommend everyone I know to come here.
