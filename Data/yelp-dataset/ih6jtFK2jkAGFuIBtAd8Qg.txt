5	Highland Park is an excellent City Park surrounded by a multi-dimensional neighborhood. Amenities include a wooden-structure playground, a Farmhouse/playground, baseball field, tennis courts, the largest City-run swimming pool, sand volleyball court, walking track, hiking trails, bike trail, cycling racetrack, and two reservoirs. Sunday Jazz Concerts in the Park in August are sponsored by CitiParks.
5	I love going to Highland Park for a walk with my husband. I find it very relaxing! The reservoirs are pretty gross but I try not to look at it. It looks like breeding ground for mosquitoes.
5	The younger kiddies go crazy when we take them to Highland Park.  There is a good sized wooden play area, with lots of places to climb and hide.  There is plenty of room to pack a picnic and in the center of this park is a fountain.  I'll admit we get into the fountain. No one has yelled at us yet.
4	I am torn on Highland park from time to time because I cannot walk my pooch around the little resevoir lap near the main entrance. But it boasts pretty fountains walking trails or a paved road to run on if you prefer. So four it is.Also it has this awesome castle looking playground, I want to run and jump on but I am childless and probably cannot take my dog on there. So i resist the temptation. Highland park is sizeable for biking, hiking, and also borders the fabulous Zoo, I also find it to be a little less crowded than Frick on most days, parking is along the park loop so its easy. There is a swimming pool here and, it is a dog friendly on leashes park. This is also a fabulous neighborhood to grab coffee or lunch in after a nice midday stroll.
5	Great place to run
5	Probably my favorite city park. It is always so clean and quiet. The dog owners are more respectful here, in general, than in Frick Park. The reservoir is beautiful and fun to walk around. It's just a very classy park!
