4	It's called Party City... so obviously they're going to carry party supplies.  But unless you've been in there, I don't think you can imagine the breadth of selection.  You want pink party decorations?  Well what color pink would you like - baby pink, bubble gum, hot pink, fuchsia, salmon, rose...?  You get the idea.  It's just about that crazy.  Sign up for their email list and get coupons for great discounts.
3	I never really buy anything here because it's overpriced.  First I hit up the Dollar Tree for the party decor that will make it's way to the dumpster by the end of the night and then maybe I'll swing by here to see what I'm missing.  I think the last thing I purchased here were some shot glass necklaces which continue to prove useful time and time again.It's clean.  The staff is alright, I mean they are teens working there part time and we all know how shitty teens can be when you ask them for something.
1	This girl that helped me yesterday was brain dead.  When she finally asked someone what I was looking for, she took me to the area...needed to try a costume on, she left and said she had to go do some cashier stuff, would send someone else over and no one else came so I walked out.
