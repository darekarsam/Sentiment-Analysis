3	A good place to get your Arby's fix. I have a soft spot for the Arby's roast beef. I think its unique taste and texture is related to how thin they slice the meat.For the last couple years at least, the backside of the receipt gets you a free regular roast beef on the next visit if you call in or take the web survey within two days.Good and friendly service, free parking lot make this relatively unique for fast food in this neighborhood.
4	This arbys is a pretty good one to go to. The food is always hot and fresh! The workers are always kind and will deliver your food to your table if you are already sitting down too. I'm a big fan of their Hawaiian bun sandwiches along with their chicken sandwiches. It's not my first choice for a meal but if you are looking for something quick and easy and you like roast beef then this is the place to go. The only "bad" thing about this place which I wish they would have is a drive thru since it is a fast food place.
5	Absolutely the kindest staff and quick good service.  They saw me coming with a stroller and rushed to get the door, very kind and friendly!
