5	I was referred to Faline for my first ever permanent make up  job. I was petrified as I have seen aweful brows out there. I went for my brows and eyeliner today and I can not tell you how very happy I am with the results!!! She did a beautiful job.. She re shaped my eyebrows so they look beautiful and it gave me an instant eye lift!!!  Just love it. Can't wait to get my lips done!!!!
