5	Albert responded promptly to a burst water heater that was flooding my garage.  He gave me specific instructions for disabling the water and gas intake to my tank over the phone to stop the leak.I called on him to replace the pressure release valve, and he did, but then we discovered that the water heater burst in multiple locations and required replacement.  Albert and his son installed a brand new water heater that same day.Albert provided excellent, honest service and at a very affordable price.  I will certainly hire him for future plumbing jobs.
5	Extremely affordable and reliable. Don't use the big named guys they are almost twice as much. Hard working and honest.
5	Highly recommend Albert & Sons Plumbing. Fair pricing, very professional, punctual and courteous to clean their work before they leave. Very happy with their services. Just had them replace 3 toilets in outer home, been using them for general plumbing needs for the past 2 years.
