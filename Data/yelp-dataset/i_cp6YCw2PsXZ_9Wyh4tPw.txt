4	I had a really good experience here with Dr Neary and staff! I have worked in the dental field for a number of years now and until recently, always had the luxury of being a patient in the practice that i worked... It was quite scary blindly picking a new dentist that I didn't know, but I think I did a darn good job! Upon calling for an appointment, the front office woman Teri was incredibly friendly and helpful with finding an appointment that worked with my schedule. She pointed me to the paperwork on their website, which I filled out ahead of time. She scheduled me for a new patient exam, xrays and cleaning and then gave me a reminder call the day before the appointment.  The hygienist, Ellen I believe, was also very friendly. After taking my full series of xrays, she gave me a thorough cleaning with very minimal discomfort (I floss.)  ;)  Dr Neary came in when she was through and went over all the usual and necessary stuff. He was thorough in his exam and didn't try to sell me anything. Everyone was efficient, kind and thorough. Dr Neary is a keeper!
1	I have been going here for several years.  My insurance fully covers all routine visits (cleaning, basic x-rays).  I went in for a routine visit and then get a bill. Upon investigating, I find out that they are no longer part of my plan (and hadn't  been for five months) AND  THEY DIDN'T BOTHER TO LET ME KNOW BEFORE THE APPOINTMENT!!  They asked if I was still with the same plan and when I said "YES", they should have told me that they were no longer part of that plan.  Their actions are unethical.  I shouldn't have paid the bill.  Who wants to go to a doctor that runs his business in a shady way.

Great practice and would highly recommend!!                                                Mike P.                                               Scottsdale
