5	I was late on my appointment  but was able to get in right the way..  Very professional and experience staffs... Office is super clean!!!
5	Affordable, great service!  Very friendly staff, punctual and great dentist.  I went to other dental facilities in Goodyear that tried to trick me into getting $500 services I didn't need.  Dr. Ngo provides fair prices, great quality services and doesn't try to get you into debt with services you don't need.
1	I agree with 2 other reviews that their prices are reasonable. However after setting up an appointment, I contracted food poisoning after eating in a restaurant and had to call them with 4 hours notice to postpone the appointment. Their office manager went ballistic with anger and accused me of being undependable and inferred that I was lying, and insisted that I come in for the appointment anyway even though I was vomiting and had diaarrea. When I refused, he stated that I was no longer a patient there and he was also cancelling my girlfriends appoinment in which her services had already been started and an appliance had already been made.In my opinion this type of behavior is very unprofessional and bodes very poorly regarding any others that are considering doing business with them. I do not recommend them.
