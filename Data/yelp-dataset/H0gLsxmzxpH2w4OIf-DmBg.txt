5	This Great Clips has been here ever since I was born, which was '86. It is the only place I have gotten my haircut ever and I have never had a problem with them messing it up.
5	I love this Great Clips.  I always call ahead and make sure Annalisa is working.  She does a really good job on my long, thick hair.  First time I came in, I knew I just wanted something new.  Some more volume, some more texture.  She gave me great layers and a style that's easy going.  So lucky I found her.  I've been seeing her for a couple years now.  Everyone else there seems pretty cool, too.
5	Get Rick!!! The man knows hair. He's been cutting hair for over 30 years . I went in this morning and needed a trim but wanted to keep my length. He told me no problem and went to it. It is been some time since my hair has looked this nice. The man has a wonderful personality, and a very loud voice. I have incredibly sensitive ears and it kind of hurt with his volume, but the haircut is well worth it.
