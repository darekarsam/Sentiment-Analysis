5	As a real estate broker and business owner I have had to call on Terry and his team from time to time.  They always offer careful, considered counsel and ask the questions necessary to understand each particular situation.  Great attorney that does business the right way.  Highly recommend!
5	I couldn't have asked for more when I needed legal assistance. Terry Fong's honesty and speed to assist me with what I needed was more than I could have asked for. If you are looking for a great attorney, look no further. Terry Fong Law Group is wonderful!!!
1	During initial meeting we were told that a $2,000 retainer was due.  Terry said that he felt the case was simple and that the initial retainer would not be exceeded.The initial retainer was exceeded with things such as his $125/hr assistant making copies.  Next time we will make our own copies, thanks.At the point of going $1,050 OVER THE RETAINER we were sent a bill for $1,050 + an additional $2,000.  Might have been nice to get a heads up that we were getting close to going over the retainer.  In addition, this was a simple, uncontested divorce case where the mom went crazy and started requesting temporary orders, a slew of items that she inflated the values of and felt the need to request half the value of.Do any of YOU have a 10 year old dining room table and chairs that is still worth $1,000?  I have never seen any such thing.  It's called Craigslist.  $50.The temporary orders hearing was spent with Terry standing there with his mouth hanging open getting trounced all over by a self-represented sociopath.  He let her talk for 50 minutes of the hour long hearing, and didn't even speak to the judge asking her to stop.And, finally, my favorite, she got EVERYTHING she asked for and the judge completely ignored EVERYTHING Terry said in this "open and shut, this is so easy" case.GIve me a break.
