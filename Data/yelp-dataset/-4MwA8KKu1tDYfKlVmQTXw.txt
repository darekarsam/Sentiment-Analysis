1	Horrible experience. Make sure and read everything because they will lie to you about what you are signing in order to make some extra money.
3	I came in for a deal and not wanting to hear alot of drama to get a rental.  To my surprise this location was straight and to the point and offered me a special rate without trying to nickel and dime me to death with added charges.  Thanks Enterprise, if only the other rental agencies could follow your lead..........
1	Incompetent idiots; these people are. Don't waste your time with this Enterprise location. Thumbs down.
