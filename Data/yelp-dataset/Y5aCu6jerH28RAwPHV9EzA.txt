5	Hannah Zakari is one of those shops where I could easily spend my entire bank balance on all the beautiful and quirky jewellery inside.  I went in recently to buy Christmas presents for my sisters, and ended up taking lots of photos to send my boyfriend as 'ideas'... fingers crossed something finds its way to my stocking!Last year I got a necklace from here which unfortunately broke after about two hours' wear... however they arranged for a replacement to be sent by the jeweller and it all got sorted without any fuss.And if you're not in the area, they have a website too where you can spend all your money on beautiful jewellery without having to set foot inside the shop!
