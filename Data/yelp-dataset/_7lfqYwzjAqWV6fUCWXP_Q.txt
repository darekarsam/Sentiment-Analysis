5	I had an awesome barista who advised me to try out a specific drink and it was delicious! The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere seemed very relaxed and welcoming.
5	Lovely ambiance, outside seating, the friendliest baristas I've ever encountered, and will always accommodate my huge coffee orders for my coworkers with extra cream, stirrers, and spill savers. Great branch of my favorite coffee chain!
5	Convenient. Delicious. Friendly.We love this place - even if it is a chain establishment. It is our go-to coffee place nearby because of its friendly baristas and delicious coffee. Very easy to get work done with a cuppa Joe since they have several large tables to use. They even have a little kids' play area!Will definitely be back for more!
5	I love this place. The staff is friendly and upbeat. The drink are good and ots a nice atmosphere. The should expand into a bigger shop!
2	Not my fav coffee place. Baristas tend to be quite pushy. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and a latte. Wasn't even sure it was my latte when she called it out cuz she rattled off something incoherent and when I asked if it was mine she got snotty with me. I will never get another breakfast sandwich there again! They pulled it out of a plastic wrap and tossed it into a warmer! It more than likely came to the store frozen. If I want that I'll order from the Schwann's guy and make it myself. Overall, not impressed.
