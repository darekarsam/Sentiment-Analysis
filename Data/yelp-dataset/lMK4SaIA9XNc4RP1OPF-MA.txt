5	We stumbled upon Cafe Rico our first afternoon in Montreal and went back every day of our visit.  They serve the richest fair trade coffee and the most beautiful croissants we I tasted in Montreal.  Our toddler was overjoyed that there was a play kitchen there for him to explore while the grownups drank cafe au liat.  We were a bit puzzled as to why the cafe opened so late in the morning, at 10 am, but found the coffee worth the wait.
4	A quaint hippie place that we came across one afternoon. The first thing i noticed when I walked in was the strong smell of coffee. They clearly care about the coffee here. They have a nice setup in back for roasting their own beans and it seemed about half their business is in selling beans. As any hippie place worth its salt, their coffee is fair trade and their milk is organic.  They have a variety of bulk grains and nuts for available as well, but Their focus is really on the coffee. The staff were friendly and working hard as the place was slammed. They've got Wi-Fi available and a unique but lovely decor. A nice change from the run of the mill coffee shop chain.
4	Great coffee and friendly staff. Wonderful selection of fair trade coffee beans for sale as well. Try it out, you won't be disappointed.
4	A cool local java joint with tasty espresso and good macchiatos. Although I'll be the first to admit I had no idea there were short and long macchiatos... I think Starbucks has messed up the coffee jargon in my brain a bit.For the uninitiated, a short macchiato is very similar to a double espresso. Also, the hot chocolates here do not taste very sweet, so you may need to add sugar.
4	This is for the new Mt Royal location. Coffee is great. Prices are great for quality you get. Staff are nice. Only neg stuff is: coffee grinder machine is very loud. Today they had very little food. They need a staff member to clear tables during busy weekends.
