5	We recently purchased a condo in Sun City, Arizona, as a home base for my husband to obtain medical treatment via the Mayo Clinic and Banner Boswell Hospital's Rehabilitation program, so we have slowly began exploring the various recreation centers available to us.  During one of visits to the Bell Recreation Center, we discovered Memo's Bistro, and are we ever pleased.  Memo's Bistro is located inside the building that houses the bowling, billards, and indoor shuffle-board courts.  Easy access to the restaurant is located at the back side of the buildings, where there is also free covered parking beneath the newly installed solar system panels.  It was afternoon when we arrived at the restaurant, but the friendly waitress assured us we could order breakfast anytime, so I ordered the "sweet potato pancakes."  You see I've never encountered sweet potato pancakes in a restaurant, or any place else, in my entire life and my parents were raised in the South where sweet potatoes are a staple.  To my great surprise, the pancakes were a culinary thrill.  Light, and ever so tasty.  Not sure I'll ever want a regular pancake again.  Our entire dining experience was excellent, from the good tasting food, to excellent/friendly service, to the clean and welcoming interior.  All menu items were reasonably priced and check-out was easy.  We will return to Memo's Bistro in the future, as I can't wait to order the sweet potato pancakes again.  Yummy!
4	A group of 20 of us had an excellent Sunday Buffet Breakfast this morning.  Began with an Omelette station. The Chef was Rock N Rolling using 3 omelette pans at a time. The omelette was fluffy and delicious.  Also, choice of bacon, sausage, hash browns, biscuits & gravy. Chicken Fajitas, assorted pastries, fresh fruit salad, and deserts. Service was very good.I believe price was $9.99.We will definitely be back..Job well done!
