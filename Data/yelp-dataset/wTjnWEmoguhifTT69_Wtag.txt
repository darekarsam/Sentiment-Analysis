3	This is the new McDonalds next to the Wal-Mart at Baseline and Country Club/Az Ave.  There's not much to say about it other than it seems to replace the indoor McDonald's that used to be in the store.  I'm no longer a McDonald's fan, haven't been for years, but I do stop by for their cheap iced coffee on a hot day occasionally.  It's only a dollar for the regular and $2 for the tall.  I just wish they would use a sturdier glass for the tall.  I always fear the lid will pop off when I lift it up to take a sip, especially in the car.
5	I have been a Fan of Micky D's for years. I enjoy this Micky D's over others as the workers are friendly and for it only being  approx. 6 months old it is kept fairly clean.
1	Went through the drive thru to get kids some mc nuggets last night. Ordered 40. When I got home each kid said they were shorted. 2 boxes with 8 and 2 boxes with 7. Shorted 10 in total. I called and after they let the phone ring for about 3-5 min, a manager named Mario picked up. I explained the situation and he said I could pick up the 10 missing. I was too tired to go back last night so he told me to go back sometime today and he would leave a note. So I stop by as I'm running errands and they won't give me the nuggets because Mario only left a note saying something to the effect that he has taken care of it and that I should come back again when Mario is there. I told them that not only was I not returning ever but that I would be doing this and they seemed fine with it. They can't be trusted to get your order right. Whatever they're getting paid is already too much. Bring on the kiosks.
