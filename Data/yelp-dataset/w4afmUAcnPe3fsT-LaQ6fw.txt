4	Just Sports is a store in Scottsdale Fashion Square, and easy to spot due to the graphic entrance -- baseball bats, balls, etc.  The guys who work here were really nice and helpful. They have lots of sports gear, from t-shirts to jerseys, caps to visors, collectibles, mugs, cups, etc. The place is covered from floor to ceiling with stuff. Obviously, you'll find a lot of Cardinals, D-backs, Suns, and Arizona State gear here, but you'll see other teams and schools here. Some of the prices are a bit steep, so just be prepared for that.
1	I went into the mall for a regular return. There was no manager on duty and no sales associates in the store could authorize my return. When asked if they could call the manager they looked at me confused. I asked when the manager was to return they said one hour. This is extremely unprofessional and is an inconvenience. This will be the last time I ever shop at just sports.
