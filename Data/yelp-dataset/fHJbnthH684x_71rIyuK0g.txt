2	Dunkin Donuts and my first time trying it being Canadian, I had to try this when I saw it while visiting here in Montreal from Van city. The donuts reminded me way too much of Tim Hortons and intact was double the price of Tim's, what the heck?! Also the quality was no better than Tim's and intact service was worse. (Yes I realize I'm comparing to Tim's but c'mon I have to) I would say go to Tim's over Dunkin Donuts, but honestly I only tried one single donut maybe not enough to judge. But why wouldn't you want to go to Tim's over Dunkins ? Haha Tim's all the way, it's Canadian! I'd say pass on this place unless you wantto be able to say you tried Dunkin Donuts while in Canada haha. Is this like the only one here ? It's definitely one of very few.
4	It's Dunkin Donuts. Bland coffee like usual.  I like iced coffee with no flavor and half n half.  You get more of a selection in your milk which I appreciate not having too much fat in my coffee.  Here it's in the Bonaventure metro area in the food court of Place Marie.. where i get lost as usual lol. Cheap coffee I'm there. You have to have an acquired taste for this kind of coffee which I do like.
