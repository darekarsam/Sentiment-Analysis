5	Lovely floral arrangements for every occasion.  Her boutonnieres and corsages are lovely and inexpensive - she must have made dozens for me and my friends during high school.  You cannot beat the service here.  When students at the elementary school up the street come in wanting flowers for their teachers, she will provide them with the best for only $1 or $2.  Blooming Dahlia is the best example of hometown service I could imagine.
5	Don't buy those old pre-made arrangements from the grocery store or the overpriced stingy bunch of flowers from other places.  Come here- the service is great and the price is very reasonable.  Without realizing it, we walked in 5 minutes before closing time.  Regardless, the owner greeted us warmly and said she would be happy to help us.  I told her I didn't know anything about flowers, so she asked for a price range and the proceeded to select and arrange a fresh bouquet.  Even though it was the end of the day, the flowers were still perky and the arrangement was spectacular.  Couldn't have been happier and will recommend it to everyone I know.
5	The best bouquet of flowers I have purchased in years. The store was closed but the door was unlocked and the owner gave me a warm getting and created a great arrangement. I love that they do not sell pre arrangements, all are made as you wait. The so smells amazing. Well be my new go to for flowers.
