5	Really great Mexican ice cream shop! They have everything you can imagine, from Aguas frescas, to tostielotes. Their ice creams are absolutely delicious and always look so fresh in their displays. They have a big variety of Aguas frescas. Their smoothies are all so delicious as well. The shop is always clean and their service is always fast and great.
5	Best place to get a chamango!!!!! The cacahuetes locos are really good. They even have nutella ice cream!!!
5	Customer service is always quick and friendly Botanas are to die for the churros locos and the ice cream truly taste like Mexico
3	Okay so I love this place because they provide a variety of yummy delights! It ranges from ice cream all the way to cannolis. Now before my last visit this would have easily been 5 stars, however, I just went this past Saturday and was EXTREMELY disappointed. The guy that works there always has awesome customer service! The girls there however are not. My friend was waiting at the counter for her order to be taken while the older lady counted money or what not and pretended my friend was not even there...so they lost a customer. Another thing, I saw not 1 but 2 COCKROACHES which is very disturbing, they were climbing over the walls and left a bad taste in my mouth. I will return here, but I do think that the workers need to pay more attention to not only their customers but also cleanliness.
