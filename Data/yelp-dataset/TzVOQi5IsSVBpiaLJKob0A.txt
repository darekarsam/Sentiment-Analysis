5	I started taking my 2002 Jetta TDI here a couple of years ago after moving to the west side.Their work has consistently been better than my previous mechanic, they're quite good at working with multiple budgets ("This is a NECESSARY repair" vs "This needs to be fixed in the next 6-12mo" if you don't have a lot of money on hand, rather than adding unnecessary extras.The online appointment system on their website, as well as ability to email and discuss problems instead of relying on phone tag has also been quite handy.They came on the recommendation of two different friends, and I've since recommended them to a number of friends myself.
5	Have taken my baby here twice to get it serviced (oil change, tire rotation, general check up) and have always had a great experience. No hassle scheduling through their website.I drop my car off in the morning, get a call in a few hours regarding what needs to be done and pick it up in the afternoon.If you're looking for a car shop that gives quick, honest and reasonably priced service, I definitely recommend going here.
5	I'd never experienced having a mechanic take the time to call me a couple days after the repair to ensure the part he replaced fixed the problem. That exemplified the kind of care and service I've gotten from Westside Service Center over the years. They're honest, straightforward in their diagnoses, and never try to upsell me on non-essential repairs. I highly recommend these guys.
