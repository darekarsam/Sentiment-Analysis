5	Worth the drive if you're not in the area! I've been 3 times and each time is better than the last. I partial to the lamb, but my husband loves their fish. We both love their desserts!! the ambiance is great and the host and staff are attentive. Delicious food and great atmosphere!
4	I hesitate between 3 stars and 4 but I'll round up seeing as I'm willing to go back. This is definitely one of the nicer restaurants in the area. The ambiance is really lovely and romantic and chic. The food is hit or miss. My squash soup was very tasty but my linguini with pine nuts was a bit dry and weird. My boyfriend's bison, on the other hand, was excellent. The service is pretty slow - we went on a Thursday night when it wasn't terribly crowded. If you're not in a rush, it's a nice spot and you could luck out with one of the better tasting dishes. I'd definitely give them another try.
4	My husband and I are regulars but last month's visit was by far the best......soup, veal carpaccio, guinea foul for me and fish for him and we were in heaven. I believe these items are not on the regular menu and were specials for the week but if you have a chance to try, please do so. Service is always pretty slow so not recommended if you are in a time crunch but the food makes up for it.
