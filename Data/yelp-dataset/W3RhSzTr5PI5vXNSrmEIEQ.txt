2	Came in hoping to get in/out for a quick lunch. 35 minutes later, no meal....and it was simple: Taco's! Anyhow, once we got out food it was ok. Not sure if this place just opened, but the staff seemed a bit confused.
2	I've learned not to expect much from hotel eateries but Bluefire Grille still managed to disappoint.Located at the Hilton Resort in Scottsdale, this alcove just off the main lobby suffers from a combination of overly ambitious menus and underwhelming service. Dinner, even at 7pm with just one other table seated, can be an ordeal. A harried looking waiter was pleasant, if distracted. The menu was scattered, covering salads to duck to fish. An intriguing starter dubbed 'Scorpion Prawns' were described as U-10 prawns (big suckers) tempura coated and served with a chipotle cream cheese. The prawns were much smaller, but quite tasty. Looking for something lighter, I went with the duck salad: slices of duck on top mixed greens with sliced green apples, crumbled Gorgonzola, and candied pecans, all tossed in lemon-champagne dressing. A good mix of flavoura and textures, though the duck was just south of room temperature and verging on 'cool'.Breakfast the next morning wasn't a much better experience, with a larger crowd leading to a few errors in service. An order of a pomegranate smoothie arrived at the table as a fruit oatmeal and grapefruit juice was forgotten. What did land at the table was, however, a satisfying meal to start the day.
