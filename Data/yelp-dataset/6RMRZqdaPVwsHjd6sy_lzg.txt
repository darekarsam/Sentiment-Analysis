4	Next to the Esso station, atop a little Montreal-staircase, the "herbs' ankle boot" as it is called, is a little wonderland of leaves, teas, tinctures, home-made soaps and the like.It IS really little, teeny-tiny little. You have to zigzag carefully between the pots, and jars to find what you want but chances are their friendly staff has already offered their help by now. Their selection is huge, and they usually recommend stuff I've never even heard of, but always on point. For your DIY needs, they have recipients and jars specially designed if you want to go all-natural and make your own medicine or beauty products.If making your own tea for whatever ailment you may have doesn't tickle your fancy, you might dig their courses: they have anything from recognizing the herbs around you, to curing your pets using plants, I recently I noticed they offered "how to make your own lipbalm"! You don't need to be sick to appreciate all the goodness they have there: they have a lovely selection of organic beauty products from Quebec including shampoo, moisturizer, scrubs, bath salts etc..  That or a simple freshly-made chai tea brew wins me over every time...
