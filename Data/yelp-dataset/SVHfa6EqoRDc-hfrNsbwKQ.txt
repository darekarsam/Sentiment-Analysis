4	Julianne applied tattoo ink to my eyelids fall of 2012. I am very happy with the process. She had to do a couple of touchups, but there was no charge. She is a delightful lady and makes the time go by fast and you leave looking so much better than when you arrived. The first time it is applied it just tickles and it is not painful which I had expected. Make sure you follow her instructions for the next few days after. It sure is nice not to have such a bland look without applying makeup.
5	I originally called Julianne yesterday (thurs aug 1) to schedule an appointment, and I saw her today at noon. She is located at the district, in green valley. She is room number 9 **inside** of Sola salon behind the cheesecake factory.As soon as I walked into the lobby, she was drawn to me. She was warm, friendly and introduced herself. We went into her personal room, which is glass (she has privacy drapes). She sat me down in a very comfortable recliner, and told me a little about herself before we started to discuss my mistake.....I mean, tattoo.Julianne is certified in micro-pigmentation, which means she knows a lot about skin. She is a member of the SPCP (http://www.spcp.org/thinking-of-getting-a-cosmetic-tattoo/find-a-technician/).She does tattoo removal with natural saline. The saline removal process is a non-laser ink extraction  alternative, very similar to the regular tattoo process in that it uses similar equipment and procedures.  But instead of pushing ink into the skin, the saline removal system uses a special solution - mostly of sea salt -to create an osmotic condition. As the cells lift due to osmosis, they push the ink  into the scab and out of the skin. Saline tattoo removal generally requires 50% to 75% fewer treatments than laser tattoo removal, and unlike laser removal -- which relies on wavelengths to target  only specific colors -- saline tattoo removal method is effective on all colors of ink and on all areas of the body. (http://dragonflyink.com/tattoo-removal/)I have been nervous with laser, seeing as how it actually burns skin.She told me that she would work on a few 2 inch sections at a time, so that my body could heal properly and deal with the scabs correctly...about 5 weeks. She would also numb the area as well. Normally, she only does small tattoos (my tattoo is 30 square inches), but she told me she is willing to work with me, and that if I am willing to commit, so is she. At $100 an hour, my husband and I feel that this is a better way then $400 a session laser that will take 7-12 sessions.I can not wait to schedule with her in these next few weeks!She is a true gem personality wise, and I can't wait to work with her. She seems to really care about who she does procedures on, and what she does. I read the filtered review on this place, and it seems very positive.I will do updates!
5	Alright, the day has finally came, the day for removal to begin.Julianne is nothing but PROFESSIONAL, I was so impressed by our last visit.The removal starts with her taking a sterile needle, (which she opens in front of me) and scratching it over the tattoo, to allow the pain medicine to seep in.Then, the fun part starts. She takes her tattoo gun, and dips it into a solution of saline. With the pain medicine, I was very comfortable...of course, there were some tender spots (it's just like getting the tattoo all over again.) We are doing two small sections, with two different solutions to see which one works better with my skin, and how I heal with them. We will of course use the one that is most effective. Unlike laser, it is not a "one size" fits all approach! She sends me off with a care package, and very detailed instructions on how to treat the wound for proper healing. We have had communication, making sure that I am doing well... I don't even get that from my doctor!Today, is the second day with the wound, and it is sensitive to touch, and some clothing.. like my bra because of it's location. I am excited to see how I heal in the next few weeks!
5	Yet another day with Mrs. Julianne....This day was filled with "once again" (s), and some new items.((Something New!)) Please note, that she is no longer located in room 9.She has MOVED to room 15.[Sola Salons, The district @GVR]The room is larger, and decorated lovely. There is a pin up feel to this room....risque pictures included ! ;)My first session a few months ago was a "test" strip, testing two different solutions to see which one worked more effectively with my skin type and the mistake.................I mean, tattoo. **Once again**I am warmly greeted by Julianne. She had ran out to get an ultra soft blanket for my support (and was still on time!)**Once again**Before pulling out utensils, Julianne examines the previously treated spot, addresses my questions/concerns. **Once again**It is all about ME. My comfort and what would help make our session more productive. Our first session had me on my side, and this time I was on my stomach. Julianne also gets me in the "mood" with music.....music that I actually like. No elevator or country music here ! (by my choice, I'm sure if you wanted country, or classical, she would pull up Pandora for you....Which she offered to do for me).How can I not get in the mood of tattoo removal when JayZ and Drake is on?!?! LOL.((Something new!)) She now has a comfort fishy! Luckily, I used her pinky fishy to have more support for my neck/head, and fishy didn't have to soak up any of my tears. ((something new!)) The recliner is gone. In its' place is a new chair, that reminds me of one at the dentist's office. In a faboosh SNAKE print, of course! **Once again**clean, and sterile tools are open in front of me, with Julianne putting on a fresh pair of gloves. The products she used on me were fresh, she mixed them in front of me...They haven't been sitting around for hours, or days.The anticipation is almost worse than the actual pain. We start with a numbing process, and get to work. Julianne takes my mind off the pain by having great conversation. I don't think there was a thing that we DIDN'T talk about today...haha. Which is awesome. Who wants to sit in silence when you're getting needles dug into you, and salt solution pumped inside you? That would be awkward and painful!My pictures are posted. The letters (that have a pink/purple circle around them) are almost invisible. This is their second treatment. The center looks like a big mass of sunscreen, but that is a salt solution that we decided to leave on. I would rather have a warm, friendly, consistent, thoughtful, professional, quirky longer removal process than to have a quick solution and be treated like some cash cow number. And I'd rather not have my super fair skin burned up by a laser. Well, now that I've confessed my strange love for Julianne.....More updates, and pictures to come!THANKS AGAIN JULIANNE!!!!*****10/6/2014********It has been brought to my attention that Mrs. Julianne has bought a laser and will have it up and running in December ! Saline and laser tattoo removal will be offered! Exciting !
5	Julianne is so talented!!!  She has done life changing work on my daughter who is now gleaming with confidence.  Julianne is so kind and very patient, and she definitely stands behind her work.  I am so grateful for her and her talents.
5	I went to see Julianne about five months ago to have permanent eyeliner put on. I have tremors and I am no longer able to apply eyeliner. She is the most wonderful,Professional and kind understanding lady I have ever met. She made me feel like a queen for the day. She did such a fantastic job. I have never been so pleased about having anything done with my eyes. It is such a relief not having to worry about putting on eyeliner when my head is shaking so bad. And Julianne really understood that. I would recommend her for any tattoo removal, permanent eyeliner, tattoo eyebrows, and so much more of the things that she is able to do. We played around with make up application and she made me look so wonderful. I would give anything to be as skilled as she is. So if you're going to have anything done, tattoo eyeliner, tattooed eyebrows, make up application, tattoo removal, and so many other services she is the place to go. So if you want to feel beautiful and that you really matter then go see Julianne. Instead of five stars I give her 10. Thank you Julianne for making my eyes look so great. Love you
5	I think Julianne is so kind and caring about her clients. I went to see her again yesterday and she did a fantastic job on my eyeliner. I have trouble putting on eyeliner. So it is so wonderful to have permanent eyeliner. I would recommend her to anyone who has special needs with the services that she provides. Such as tattoo removal, permanent eyeliner, and permanent eyebrows. And so many more services. She is now doing permanent hair removal. So I am so excited to begin that service. She makes you feel like you really count. She is the most meticulous person I have ever been to. I would recommend her 100% to anyone who needs services done that she provides.Thank you Julianne for always making me feel special.
