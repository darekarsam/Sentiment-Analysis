1	My experience with Kerby's was horrible.  I dealt with Mike who the delivery staff told me was the manager.  While I like the pieces I got, my gut instinct when I was buying this was to cancel on the spot as Mike first overcharged me.  Told me the prices were in a group price. One of the pieces was much more than I was quoted, others were less.  When he redid the prices I asked why I don't get the other pieces for the prices on the invoice. Apparently, although I thought I got a good deal apparently I did not. Dead giveaway was Mike all of a sudden was sweating bullets.But what I'm most upset with was the fact that I had asked Mike if they will take away my other furniture and without me saying anything Mike assured me they would and that they donate all furniture to Habitat for Humanity.  I told him that because of this he had a sale.The delivery people came and told me they had no room on their truck and that my furniture was going to a dumpster just down the road, that they never donate to any place, everything goes in a dumpster. While the delivery people where standing there I called Mike who at first lied telling me they were directly taking it to a donation center right down the street.  When I asked the delivery people if this was true the deliver guys told me no it is not, we don't have the room, and we don't have the time, it's going to the dumpster.  I relayed this back to Mike who then got very rude, I asked him why he lied to me, I wouldn't have bought from them.  Mike told me I would have.  I told him to cancel my order.  He told me "look lady, you can't, this was a final sale, this is not New York, this is Arizona.  I told him I was going to cancel delivery and wanted my money back, he laughed and hung up on me first saying again that all sales are final.When I asked the delivery men who the manager was I was told it was Mike.  When I asked them where the other stores are they told me that nothing was open today except for this store.  "On a Saturday, none of your other furniture stores are open?"  Nope.  I refused delivery and then realized that Mike might hold my stuff hostage and my money and I chased the truck and had my pieces delivered.  Bottom line, there was no reason for Mike to lie to me.  Had he told me that they would take the furniture but they throw it out, I would have either made arrangements for a charity to pick it up before or not bought there.  He didn't give me that choice.  Mike lied, he was rude, and I will never ever buy anything from this store again.  One other little tidbit, there are signs up all over that this company is going out of business, a huge sale.  Mike shared with me when I was there that indeed they are not going out of business, they never were, they were just downsizing.  If you desire honesty and fairness as well a good customer service if there is an issue DO NOT SHOP AT KERBY'S FURNATURE.  Clearly this is not a store that gives back to the community and lies to its customers.
