1	So disappointed.  Walked in and never greeted or shown the lines they carried. Basically had to ask for help.  Blo next door was amazing and just wanted to complete my look for a night out. A guy sat in the middle of the store in his laptop never ever looked up. Go to Ulta or Sephora for service. This place was a joke. Never felt so out of place. My friends and I still spent over $100 each but will NEVER go back.
5	I've had wonderful experiences at Woo.  The staff is extremely talented, knowledgable and professional.  The atmosphere is warm and relaxing and it is so much more convenient than going into the mall for make-up or spa for facials!  Also, Woo offers a variety of excellent products and its a one stop shop for a number of great items beyond make-up (from stocking stuffers for my 3 year old, gifts for teachers and friends to hand cream and conditioner for my husband)!  I'd highly recommend checking it out!!
