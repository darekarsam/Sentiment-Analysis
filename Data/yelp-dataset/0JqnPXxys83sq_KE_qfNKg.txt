4	This is a fairly comprehensive bookshop and one of the better ones in the area.  Its main asset is in the range of books it is able to offer and it is for this range that you are likely to pay this shop a visit.Its prices are not exceptionally good, but given the quality of the literature and given the range the pricing is in line with what you would expect of a charity bookshop.You are likely to find a book you like and especially good is their autobiography section, which I would put down as its standout section.  However, all the sections are very good and I do recommend a visit.
