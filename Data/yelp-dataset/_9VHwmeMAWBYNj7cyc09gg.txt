3	The only shoe repair I know of in a 7 mile radius in this area.  It's a little spooky walking down the corridor between the grocery store and the rest of the strip mall to get to Baker's.  But the friendly staff can help with your basic repair needs.  And turnaround time and prices are reasonable.
2	Well, it's been better than it is now. I've taken shoes there for at least the last 20 years, but I'm ready to go elsewhere.I have a short left leg, so I need all of my left heels built up 3/4 inch. The last two pair didn't come out right. One squeaks and pops with each step, and the other one separated from the sole and had to be repaired. (He did fix the former once, but the squeaks returned. He just fixed the latter, nicely. Both fixes were free of additional charge.)Prices have shot up recently, quite a bit, and the guy no longer takes checks. Bring cash only.I'll probably look around for another shop for my next heel build-up.
3	Baker's was suggested as a place to have my daughter's tap shoes built up.  For a split second after walking in the door, I smelled leather shoes.  That smell was quickly overpowered by the smell of cigarettes.  While I didn't see any smoke, the smell was pungent.  We quickly left the shoes, name, and number, and were out of there.  When we returned 4 days later for the shoes, they were ready as promised.  I sent my daughter in while I waited in the car.  She was in and out in less than 5 minutes (a good thing).  When she entered the car, the smell immediately returned.  I felt sorry for her.  With the windows down for about 5 minutes, the smell finally left the car.This is a great place to take your shoes but you need to be wary of the cigarette odor as it will have a lasting effect on your clothing the longer you remain in the shop.I am rating the business with 3.5 stars but am not rounding it up to 4.
