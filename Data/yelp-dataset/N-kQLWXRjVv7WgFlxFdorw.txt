5	Quite simply, you will look and feel like a million bucks in anything Doug recommends. I went in to have some tailoring done on a suit I already owned and I couldn't believe how good the suit looked when they were finished. I have developed a new appreciation for what can only be described as an art form (please excuse the pun) as Doug explained their process with a true passion. The service is absolutely top notch and I certainly look forward to my next visit! Thanks so much Doug!
5	Amazing customer service. Go see Doug for all your clothing needs. I would not go anywhere else. Would give 6 stars if I could
5	Art Lewin Besoke Clothiers a name synonymous with Luxury in Beverly Hills is now in Scottsdale!  Doug Carlton, the owner of this new Custom Clotherie in Scottsdale Old town, is a consummate professional in every sense of the word.  Doug goes the extra mile to make each of his clients feel that are the most important client to him.  The atmosphere he has created at his boutique harkins back to the old school days of a classic haberdashery.  The atmosphere is completely comfortable and Doug makes sure to make you feelbyou are in good hands.  If you have never experienced custom clothing,  you are missing out on pure luxury.  Art Lewin Bespoke Clotherie and Doug Carlton should be your ONLY go to team.
5	I have never considered a suit shop to have my women's dress shirts tailored. But, since I have gone in and worked with "Doug", I can't imagine going anywhere else. Unlike other tailor experiences, "Doug" actually listened to how I wanted my new shirts to fit. He made my once, squarish and unflattering business shirts, into form fitting shirts that complement my body. I couldn't be happier with my experience and I recommend ALL men AND women to go to "Doug" with any suit or tailoring needs.
