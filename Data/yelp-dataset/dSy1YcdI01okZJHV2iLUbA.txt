4	Excellent service, belle ambiance.  Cependant, je vous conseille d'attendre un peu, le restaurant semble encore en rodage. J'y retournerai
3	We love the chef Akim (from les chefs show), very good at what he does.Very clean and delicate food- but clearly not enought in my plate. Prices for the dishes are between 22$ and 30$. I left hungry.Good Wine (average 12$ per glass).But still the restaurant is so beautiful and the service is very complete. Many Many staff. I am not sure i will go back.Their bar: lorbeer is a better choice for value with also an excellent quality!
5	A real gem that I am surprised has not been more widely reviewed and praised! The food was outstanding, and it was easily one of the best meals we had in Montreal (different, and better than other places that are highly regarded like Liverpool House).We tried the foie gras and the scallops to start, and both were excellent.  The foie gras is served with a lightly buttered, airy brioche that was just perfect. For dinner, we had the halibut and the black cod. Again, both were delicious. The black cod is served with shrimp dumplings that offer a little more depth to the plate. The halibut was cooked beautifully, and balanced perfectly with artichokes, brussel sprouts, and a glaze of hazelnuts.Really outstanding restaurant, cool design inside, and memorable ambiance. A very nice buzz downstairs (where there's an old timey piano and someone playing it) and a little more trendy-feeling upstairs. Will definitely be returning if/when we make it back to Montreal!
