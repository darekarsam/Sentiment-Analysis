2	Room was pretty clean. Towels smelled bad. Could feel every spring in the bed and pillows were a joke. Whole place smelled of stale smoke. Gave it 2 stars since it was in a good area and sheets seemed clean.
1	Very nice lady up front when check in, rooms very small, beds are not soft at all, old stale smell when walking in the hallway, no elevators!! They do offer shampoo but no conditier, only one bath soap!! Walls are too thin you could hear a tv on down the end of the hallway on!!! Wouldn't recommend this place to only trashy people!!
4	Have stayed here several times. Nothing fancy but clean, quiet, and excellent price. I recommend if you're not looking for high-dollar, five star hotel but want a good basic place to stay
