4	As for a chain restaurant this one is superior as for the service, cleanliness and food are top notch. Very friendly service.
1	Gave one star because I had to give something, don't let Bianca take your order because she doesn't know the menu. I had to take my food back 3 times before they got it right.
1	Worst place ever! I did not stop in fast food places in ages. Decided to use restroom after shopping & get quesadilla . Girl was cleaning floor then smashed her nose , cleaned with her pants, then decided to take order..... I asked her to wash her hands first. She said Oh yeah, & went to restroom . Later took my order, just one quesadilla .... I had to wait it for 11-12 minutes.... Really? Fast food????? Easier to stop in restaurant ! Place is sooooo dirty! Trash over filled .... I thru away quesadilla but left just a coke to drink...... Yucky!!!!
2	Ordered the Teriyaki Burger combo with no lettuce, tomato, or mayo. Waited a while for our food and they brought it out to our table. When I unwrapped my sandwich, it had everything on it that I didn't want. So I had to take it back up to the counter and wait for someone to acknowledge me so I could tell them it was wrong. Had to wait awhile longer to get my new sandwich. Ate fries while I waited. They were ok, not super fresh. The burger came out as I asked, however there were onions on it which I was not sure about when I ordered, but those were easy to pull off. The burger was quite tasty with the pineapple and teriyaki sauce. Ran out of napkins at our table and had to steal some from another table. Overall, could have been better.
