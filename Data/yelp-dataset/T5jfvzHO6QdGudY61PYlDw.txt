4	This place was a staple stop when I went to Concordia.  Large variety of drinks, bubbles and jellies. Never tried any of the food here but have heard that it is also quite good. Most memorable drink I have had here was an apple tea which was infused with fresh apple slices. Fantastic!
4	Somehow I always have suspicions over eateries in the Concordia ghetto, but I'm glad I discovered this one. Food and bubble tea are delicious, service is quick and friendly, and the place quite cosy, you can even play board games. I had the popcorn chicken with noodles and lychee green tea. For about $10, I was full and happy. It's Chinese food of the Taiwanese variety, hence not your typical Chinese restaurant. If this place was closer to home, I would definitely go there more often.
