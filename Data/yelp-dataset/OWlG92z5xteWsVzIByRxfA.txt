3	One of three Harvey's restaurants in a span of approximately five blocks (the others at Laurier and King/Weber), this one is arguably the busiest due to the proximity to UW.Service is quick and efficient, though the employees aren't as interactive as the one at King/Weber. The burger is cooked decently, and toppings are inserted with a respectable amount. Overall I was satisfied with the burger.I wish the employees here would show a bit more emotion and at least acknowledge you though.
4	The employees seem desensitized by their job, but the food is very well prepared. It does not seem sloppy at all with wrapping and building which unexpected from a chain burger place in a busy student plaza. I think it was mentioned before but I also wish the employees seemed to show more care for the customer. I have never been to a Harvey's and I asked what size their. Jr. burger was, and the cashier said ' smaller than a regular burger.' No shit....But still, it is a good place!!!! Go here.
3	It's a 2 for 1. I could literally fuel my tank with the amount of gas this place gives me (and everyone I know). The food tastes good but smells kinda like that "Harvey's smell" and it's hard to get rid of...you'll know what I mean if you try it out sometime!!
5	I expected a crappy burger since this is a university plaza, but I actually received the best veggie burger I've ever eaten here!The staff was nice and went out of their way for their customers, giving gravy on the side, saying happy thanksgiving,  telling me my burger would take a bit so I should have a seat (took less than five minutes).And my bun was perfectly toasted! Props to this Harvey's!
