2	It's not terrible. Sushi menu is definitely limited. Did not try the hibachi only the sushi which was just ok. Not bad and not good. Probably wouldn't go back voluntarily. Some of their food is out of the box frozen like the crab Rangoon instead of made to order. I asked the waitress and she told me it was frozen.  The ginger salad was terrible because the ginger sauce was bad. Salad lettuce was browning. If you have options, I say pass.
4	Nice atmosphere. I expected this to be more of a takeout place, but it is definitely more of an eat-in experience. We ordered  a Hibachi chicken meal, and some sushi rolls (Alaska and Tuna) The hibachi came with a salad, soup and choice of several sides. The salads came out, and almost immediately the soup and our main courses were brought to the table. The timing could use some improvement. The sushi was very good and the texture was better than most local places. We will definitely be back!
3	Tried hibachi.. Expensive dinner.. Food quantity and quality is ok. May be I would try 1's in a month
