5	Always grateful for a nearby Tridentine Latin Mass.Beautiful grounds, nice gathering area and small bookstore.
5	Best church ever. So traditional! Very small and great church goers. This is my church forever!!! Jesus loves me :) (teehee)
1	This is NOT a Church affiliated to the Roman Catholic Church.  It is a Schismatic Community.  If you are not familiar with this church or are new in town AND you are Roman Catholic, attending services at this location will NOT fulfill your duty of attending mass.
