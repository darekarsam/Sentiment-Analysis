2	Service was terrible. Had to wait extremely long time to get food. Not sure I would come back to this location. Floor was wet with soda every where.
1	We live about 4 miles away from this KFC (Gilbert & Baseline).  We ordered two 2pc white-meat meals and got dark meat. When I called their phone went unanswered (typical of their help, I'm sure) and I finally got a recording!  Called back and same thing (yes, checked the phone number, etc.  This is the THIRD time we have had problems at this KFC. Sadly, it seems as if this store is poorly managed and the help they hire isn't worth the minimum wage they are probably being paid. They are surly, rude, and dumb as sticks on top of it all. Avoid this KFC like the plague if you want my advice. There are newer and far cleaner stores in Mesa and Tempe and Gilbert that actually have well trained and polite and helpful staff. Too bad this isn't one of them! Who ever owns/manages this mess of a store ought to be ashamed of the lousy service, rude help and fairly dirty store! Do not go here even if you're starving!
1	Waited 40 minutes for chicken. Employees were rude about it. Once I got the chicken home I found that they had put it in the box still covered in grease to the point that the skin fell off when I pull the chicken out of the box it was disgusting. I'll never go back and frankly don't know if I'll have KFC anymore. Sure would like to find a good fried chicken place here in South East Gilbert.
