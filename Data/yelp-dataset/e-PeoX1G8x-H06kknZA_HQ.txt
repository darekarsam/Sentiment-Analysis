5	Great service last Thursday when I was holiday shopping. The shoes I wanted were not in stock but they offered to mail them to me free of charge. They said they couldn't guarantee they would arrive by Christmas but Friday evening at 6pm there was a knock at my door and they were delivered! Amazing!
5	Always get great customer service here!  If you ever go here just ask for Janelle or Mitch.  They both are amazing.  So nice and helpful!  As long as they work there I will be shopping there.
