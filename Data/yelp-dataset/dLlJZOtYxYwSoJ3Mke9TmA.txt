1	This is normally a solid three to four star review but, as a small business owner, I have seen their employees buying hard drug paraphenalia directly before shift.  I will no longer order food from this establishment.
1	One day I went to pick up a sandwich at Subway next door and decided to try Howie's.  the food smelled good and I placed an order. The guy working handed me my food and I paid and left. On the way home a friend sent me a text asking what I was doing etc. and I said I went to Howie's. his response was "don't waste your money". When I got home I took a few bites. The rest went into the trash. Never again.
4	I personally love the pizza, though you can tell they may not be of the highest quality. They guy honored a coupon for me a couple mins after they closed but they still helped me out. Don't see that from a lot of places anymore. It was a while ago and I'm sure they guy not working there anymore but that was a good call.
4	Quick and friendly service!
4	I usually order from my grub hub app, and everything is always great! Thank you!
