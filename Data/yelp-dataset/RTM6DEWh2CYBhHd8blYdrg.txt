3	Oh the TSA Checkpoint...I often wonder how one ends up with this job; possibly some type of DMV referral process?  Pretty much a thankless job, and one that does not have a lot of great customer interactions.  This one does get an 'A-OK' rating from me this time.  Traveling out of Phoenix to go back home.  The line was short, and the TSA Agents were actually friendly and a little chatty with us.  Maybe we caught them on an off day.  Either way this was a quick and painless process.
1	Really disappointed, I know there are security procedures for a reason but when someone is wrong they should not be defensive and just admit to error. Coming in from Mexico I purchased 2 bottles of 3.4 ounces of vanilla not knowing I would be going thru TSA security again for my connecting flight home. I was told this was over the 3 oz limit and not able to go thru in my carry on. In my husbands bag there was an 8oz bottle of sunscreen, that passed security  just fine. When I questioned why his 8 oz bottle went thru just fine but my 3.4 was not both the TSA officer and the supervisor told me it was up to the agents discretion of what can pass and what can't. So then what's the point of having all these rules and regulations if it comes down to whomever lets whatever pass. An 8oz bottle of sunscreen vs 3.4 bottle of Mexican vanilla . Really !?!?! It feels like all this security is just a power struggle between officers and passengers instead of actually having a purpose of safety. BTW ..when I asked the original TSA agent about the option to check my bag she said it was a cost of $25, when the supervisor was talking to me he said a lot of times the airlines don't charge because they need the cabin space, however because I had already given up my item I could no longer get it back..so ya thanks for trying to make your wrong a right...but not really
