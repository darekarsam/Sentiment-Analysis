1	COPS COPS and more COPS people getting arrested lots of guns not a safe stay for the family or anyone else for that matter! also rooms smell like smoke
1	My stuff was stolen from my room. Management and staff unhelpful and unapologetic. Going to file a police report.
3	No fridge, microwave or hairdryer.  Have to pay extra for those.  Rooms are pretty thin, could hear the guy next to me yelling on the phone every once and a while.  Not many channels on the tv, but the tv was HD so I was able to hook up my PS4 to it.  I like that you can just pull up to your room, so its easy to pack/unpack.  No continental breakfast either...just coffee and snack machines.  Although there are a lot of places close by to eat, which helps make up for that.  But it sucks to have to leave in the morning to eat, especially when its cold out.  Bed was firm, which I liked.  Room was clean, but not very big.  Overall, I had to give it 2/5 stars because I've stayed at other hotels for the same price that have necessities like a fridge, microwave, and continental breakfast.Wi-Fi isn't very good either.
3	Pros:1. The towels, the bed, the carpet were all clean2. Quiet place to rest for a quick trip into Madison3. Conveniently located just a little East of the airport4. Very affordable rates5. There are in-room safesCons:1. There were some sketchy people driving aroundI had no problems while staying here for one night even though I had noticed some sketchy people driving around the motel. After reading some of the other reviews, I would definitely suggest locking things up if you're leaving things in the room. I didn't think it was located in a bad area.
