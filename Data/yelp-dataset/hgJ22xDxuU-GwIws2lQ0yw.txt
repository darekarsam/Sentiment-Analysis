4	love this place. fair prices (pedicure starts at $20), nice people, great work. my feet are always pretty when i leave. the service is relaxing, but not luxurious.  i'm pretty hard on my poor feet: camping, hiking and refusing to wear shoes at home and even with all that abuse my pedicure consistently looks great 3 weeks later. strange location between an ace hardware and a auto parts store. i'm not an appointment kind of girl but they don't seem to mind - i never have to wait long no matter when i stop by. 4 stars.
4	Very clean salon. Very courteous staff.  Great manicure and pedicure.  Even willing to speed up my appointment because I had to leave at a certain time.
5	Very friendly place, great service.  They don't try to push a lot on you for the pedi's, which is really nice. Reasonably priced. Being going to them for a month and will continue to go to them.
5	Very friendly and courteous staff. My daughter and I arrived around 4:25 on Sunday (they close at 4). As they still had customers inside they greeted us as if they had just opened. The wait was not long before they did mine and my daughter's nails. The technician who did our nails took her time and did an amazing job on our gel manicures. Amazing service all around. So glad to have found this gem so close to home. Will definitely be back =)
