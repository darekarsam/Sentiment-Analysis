5	My favourite health food store in Montreal! Friendliest owners!
5	This is my favourite store in Montreal. The staff are so nice and helpful. I go there 3 times a day! This is a gem! Also great for glutan free!
1	I ordered a medium apple, orange and carrot juice and was squeezed of $11.25 including tax. After exclaiming at the checkout the cashier told me I should have ordered a juice off the menu rather than mixing three types of fruit as it's cheaper and "just as delicious".If that's the case, it's clear that the business is not existing to overcharge unsuspecting customers, instead the menu pricing is just poorly designed. Paying $11.25 of a three-fruit juice is obscene. Please fix this!But that's life...
