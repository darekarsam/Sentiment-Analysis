3	I want to give this place 2 stars, but it gets 3 because it actually has great espresso.  The barista was totally rude.  Also, why is there a small cafe inside of a furniture store?I would've never come here if it hadn't been raining outside, but I recommend the espresso... to go.
4	A furniture store with a cafe?!!! Be still my beating heart!!!!!!We were trying to make it to Sparrow (across the street) but they were closed - for no apparent reason! Crazily hungry and sweaty - since we bixi'ed the entire way uphill to Sparrow, we decided we had to eat at the first place we set eyes on, enter: Olam!We waltzed in this placed preparing to have a mediocre meal and voila! I had a ridiculously delicious sandwich and salad (i cant even remember the details because my husband had the MOST AMAZING quiche lorraine! it was hot and flaky and MMmmMmmm...so good. The coffee was excellent and while we waited for the check I perused the furniture and a dreamed a little dream of redecorating whilst sipping a marvelous latte and baking quiche!
