5	I couldn't be happier with Dr. Forsberg and his professionalism and skill. In fact, he is the epitome of not only professional, but has an amazing "bedside" manner if you will, which is always helpful when speaking with a doctor. He's friendly, warm, kind and willing to listen to your thoughts as well as guide you along in helping you with your decisions. He doesn't rush through an appointment, which is what I like the most. He is very interested in doing his utmost for his patient.I am technically now a former patient since he has relocated, but if I was thinking about having any major procedures done...I would be off to his new office in Phoenix/Scottsdale and he would be the ONLY one I would give my business to.I for one have never been disappointed in any procedure Dr. Forsberg has done. From Botox to injections, to mole and cyst removals. His skills are second to none. I highly recommend him for all your cosmetic needs and then some. You won't be disappointed as you are in excellent hands with Dr. Clay Forsberg!
5	Dr. Forsberg is a complete professional in all respects. His bedside manner and his knowledge is second to none. He removed something that could have been very problematic down the line. I cannot recommend Dr. Forsberg enough for his help.
5	Dr. Forsberg is an amazing surgeon. I have done tons of research on Plastic Surgeons and I'm so glad I found this doctor, he is the best!  He is very attentive, honest, caring and extremely knowledgeable. Dr. Forsberg truly has the magical hands!!!
5	Dr. Clay Forsberg does a great job. Met with Dr. Forsberg for a procedure, he explained everything  concisely. Had the procedure as described by Dr. Forsberg, and all went well. His follow up afterwards is terrific and something other Physician should strive to do. All in all the procedure turned out great, and I was very happy with Dr. Forsberg work.
