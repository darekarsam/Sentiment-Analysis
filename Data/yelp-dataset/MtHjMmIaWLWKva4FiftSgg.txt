1	Terrible customer service and extremely rude. I was there to ask questions about skateboards and wheels, which I know absolutely nothing about but wanted a gift for my son. Both guys there acted like they had no time for me, and I ended up buying a $200 gift certificate. When my son went there to buy his deck, trucks, etc, he said he would've walked out of there if it weren't for the gift certificate. He was treated like an idiot. NEVER again. And from the Facebook posts I've read, they clearly don't care about customer service.
1	Since writing my initial review, I have received several messages from the business owners accusing me of making false claims, being a "troll" and making accusations that I wrote a bad review because I didn't like a post on Facebook that they made. It has been absolutely absurd.
5	One Up skate shop is run/operated by some of the nicest most honest people I've ever had the pleasure of working with. As both a customer and freelance filmmaker, the whole shop has not only been extremely supportive of our work but has always gone to great lengths to support the community (hosting several events for family, friends and enthusiasts) while staying true to what they believe in along the way. In many years to come, this shop will continue to stand as one of the most important skate shops that Pittsburgh has ever seen.
