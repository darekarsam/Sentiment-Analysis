4	Like any PPP you're not going for gourmet food, so I'll start by saying the pizza and other food was good when compared to Domino's, Chucky Cheese, Pizza hut, etc. Had a pitcher of beer it was cold and two frosty glasses. For a kids' night out it can't be beat and this Carefree Highway location was clean, good courteous service. Others I've been to had clueless high school kids running the place, but this location is definitely much better. Four instead of five stars because at least 3 arcade machines were out of order and it was pretty packed on a Wednesday night.
3	Fun to hang out or have a party. The pizza kind of tastes like frozen pizza but can't expect much when coming to places like this. Overall a pretty good time.
5	Love this place. Great for the kids and always clean. I can always tell when a restaurant has great management. Our kids never wait for a ticket attendant. This makes the experience for the parent enjoyable.
5	Great PPP. All the employees are so nice and friendly. Came in for lunch buffet with my daughter and husband. Great pizza and fun family environment!!!
