2	There are a lot of good inexpensive Indian restaurants in Montreal. This isn't one of them. Too much of the food is pre-cooked and re-heated upon ordering and the combination of flavours in the sauces is mundane at best. We ate at the restaurant once and ordered take out on another occasion. Neither experience was satisfying which is a shame. - The restaurant is close to home.
5	Delicious food.  They are inexpensive and they have a nice variety of vegetarian and meat dishes.  They have Bollywood movies playing in the dining area.  Best dishes: *butter chicken and shahi paneer: the sauce is delicious*Channa Samosa: to die for. Ten million times better than Pushaps!You shouldn't  expect fancy shmancy stuff, but you can definitely expect delicious food!
5	Kuljit is that hole in the wall you tell yourself you're better than, until of course, you actually eat there and realize how wrong you were; this place is phenomenal and they're serving up some of the best Indian food in the city! That's what happened to me. I was put off by the ugly decor and the scratched up, stainless steel dishes, however, upon trying their food,... let's just say my expectations were blown out of the park. The food is incredible, specifically their butter chicken and vegetable pakoras! The server, presumably the wife to the operation, is sweet and really takes care of you. The cook, again assuming it's the husband, makes fantastic food. And that's all there is to it.  True Indian food at an amazing price.
