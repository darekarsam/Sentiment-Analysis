5	I've been buying supplies here for the pass couple years.. Great services and great prices!!!  Staff are very friendly!!
4	I only been here once but they have EVERYTHING you need for a great set of nails and the prices are pretty reasonable. The service was good and they are very helpful and quite friendly.  I love this store!
2	Service was horrible, there  was one man in the store and he kept following me through the isles. I'm pretty sure he thought I was going to steal something. I didn't find that their prices were reasonable. I paid $15 for hemp lotion and $8 for nail polish. Hmmmmm not sure if I'll be coming here again.
3	Nothing is more annoying than a overly packed store. The isles were packed and they had boxes all along the floor. You literally have to watch your step to make sure you don't fall over. It looked like they had lots a great stuff but I lost my patience after 5 minutes or so.
1	First and last time I buy anything from this store if I could give it "0" stars I would... The lady has extremely bad customer service.. Wanted to return some stuff (which I had the receipt with me) one being a pump dispenser that leaked when you would put slight pressure to the container( which I showed the lady because we filled it up with water) so this lady was making all these excuses not to refund me even after she saw and I tried to explain.... Just a lil FYI if you're thinking of buying nail supplies here just make sure you're not thinking of returning them, they'll make up excuses just to not issue a refund..... Paid $6 but turns out I got it on sale but it's original price is $13
