4	Tammi Musemicu was awesome! Been looking for a good hair stylist and I think I just found one. My husband and son have been going to her for some time now but cutting women's hair is different than guys, anyways she did a fabulous job. I only did 4 stars but I will review again after color. :)
5	Tammi does a great job. She is very personable and professional. She listens to what you want. Very caring and dedicated to her work.
5	Come get a great haircut.  Tammi is awesome and a great person.  She takes as much time as needed to make sure you look your best.  She is even great with kids.  My two sons love coming to see her.  It's nice when your kids actually want to go get there hair cut.
