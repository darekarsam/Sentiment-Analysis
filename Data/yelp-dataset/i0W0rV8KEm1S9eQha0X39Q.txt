5	My wife loves this place. Great location and Hannah and Tony always make you feel welcomed.
5	Everyone is so friendly. Best nail salon I've been to in a long time! Me and the hubby both had a mani pedi, very thorough with my cuticles which is a major plus and did a good massage and paint was perfect. Plus they gave me basically a flip flop not the flimsy ones that fall apart.
3	I was visiting from Texas and needed a fill, so I came here. My mom also came along to get a pedicure.This salon is very clean, and staff is friendly.The fill and pedicure were mediocre, but very overpriced compared to the places at home.I  probably wouldn't come back here, because the work and service wasn't spectacular.
3	Very thorough with cuticle cutting. I like gel tip only. The salon had MANY gel colors to choose from. Lots of staff, lots of staff standing around. I came in and one employee was asleep in the pedicure chair. The lady that started my nails sat there for about 4 minutes just staring into space. I asked her to begin. She was almost done with my toes when she asked to stop so she could take care of a waxing customer. I kindly let her know I did not have the time.
