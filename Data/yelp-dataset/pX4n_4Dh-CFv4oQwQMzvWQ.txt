5	the wizard will always hold a special place in my heart. whether we went to him for crazy flavored white-owls or cloves - it was always an experience.the best part about the place is the name. a few years back there was a store called 'kitchen wizard.' the store was marked by large illuminated letters above the entrance. eventually the store went out of business and it was converted into a smoke shop. in a remarkable marketing and cost-prevention move, the new owners merely removed the 'kitchen' letters, and replaced it with 'smoke.' there my friends is ye ol fairy-tale of the smoke wizard.we always refer to the store as a person - "how late is the wizard open?" hey! i saw the wizard today!" really this just added a sense of excitement to rather bland and unhealthy hobby - but you'll have that.
5	yep.he's still got it.
3	Has all your basic needs, they also sell hookahs and hookah tabacco & coals.
5	Haven't been able to find Bali Shag for years & the wizard has it in several varieties.
4	Kewl store
1	Went here to buy some hookah supplies, but ended up not purchasing anything. The woman at the counter was extremely rude and had attitude problems. I literally had all the things in my hands, but decided not give her any business and referred all my interested friends to someplace elsewhere. No one deserves to be maltreated if you're having a bad day. Work on your customer service skills!
3	A decent smoke shop with all of the essentials. They had a good selection of glass pieces and I bought one for myself at a reasonable price. I've heard some not-so-nice things about the woman behind the counter, and she was pretty short with me as well. She was on the phone the entire time I was looking, but she did accept my $22 instead of the $25 that the piece cost - but this was only because she said she needed to get outside to smoke a ciggy. Cash only!
