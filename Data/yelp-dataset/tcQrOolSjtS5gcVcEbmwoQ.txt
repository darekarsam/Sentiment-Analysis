5	Had green chile grill at an evening stop by the Four Peaks tasting room, totally by accident. This green chile is awesome -- had a steak-green chile burrito that was super spicy but so tasty, and a quesadilla with nicely grilled chunks of chicken breast, cheese, and onions. This stuff is the real deal, Phoenix. I'm from Tucson, and don't throw around mexican food accolades much, so you can trust in this review. Hunt it down and feel the oh so good green chile burn.
5	OMG! So delicious!  3 chicken tacos with chips and tomatillo salsa for $7.  What a deal!  Enjoy - you will not be disappointed.
