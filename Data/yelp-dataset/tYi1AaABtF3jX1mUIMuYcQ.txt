2	Nestled in a little cranny of duquesne university, this little Subway is here to provide food to hungry college students. It is a Subway, though, so we're not talking gourmet. Normally, a conventional subway experience would garner three stars, but this one failed me on this visit in three capacities: 1) a broken oven, so no toasted sub and 2) no provolone cheese. These are only mild irritants, to be sure, but the third I found somewhat irksome. The sandwich seemed very light on the meat. Makes me think the restaurant is skimping to save, but I could be wrong. That said, the dining area is clean and well maintained, and the staff friendly.

You don't come here because you just LOVE their oven roasted chicken. You come here because it is on campus, reasonably priced, and very fast. To that end, they certainly deliver as much as even the best Subways can. They get my approval.
2	I work a few feet from this Subway.  I always walk about five minutes and go to the Subway at the Consol instead.    This particular Subway on Forbes avenue sits on the Duquesne university campus.  I always feel uncomfortable going to this particular Subway because of the attitudes that I often get from them employees.  Once I got yelled at when I asked if I could substitute a pop / soda instead of a milk for a kids meal.  The employee yelled at me and my nephew screaming and slamming a milk in his hands. He said loudly "No!!  Juice.   juice juice or milk milk milk!!!!;"   often I realize that the employees laugh and talk in a foreign language in front of customers. I fully understand if you cannot substitute items but don't scream and yell if the customer is being respectful and just asking.  Also they put tons of mustard on my sandwiches when I also say very little.
