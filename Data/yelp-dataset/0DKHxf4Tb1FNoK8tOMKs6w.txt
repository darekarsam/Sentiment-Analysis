4	Alot of people hate dealing with car dealerships, auto repair shops, etc because most of the time they feel like they are being ripped off, talked to like they are idiots, or the interaction with the people are just more trouble than its worth. I am a shade tree mechanic and absolutely hate letting anybody else touch my car as i do 90% of my own work and trust very few. Tires happen to be one of those things you cant do yourself because of the machines involved and for that i usually go to Discount Tire. After a very negative experience at the West Flamingo location where i honestly was told i don't know what i am talking about i wrote a letter to the Discount Tire office and was contacted by a district manager who sent me to the location off Blue Diamond across from Silverton. This is where i met BILL the manager of this store and his crew, who when i arrived promptly cared for my car and listened to me about the difficulties with my particular set of wheels (rather than not listening and telling me im wrong like the other store). I wan mounting a tricky set of high end forged wheels that required some extra parts and sensors for the car they were being mounted to which is why it took 3 separate times for me to go back and forth the the store to finally get the job completed. During the different times i returns there were bottlenecks that needed to be addressed but at no time did i feel like the store and its crew ever did not have a hold of the work that was being performed, it was just a matter of my parts being difficult. In the end all work was performed and completed and their patience with my job was appreciated as i know its not the typical mount and balance on a Ford Focus. I have now found my go to people for tire labor and will recommend them highly for the customer service and patience.... walk in and ask for BILL.
5	Came to this shop after I found out that I had a screw in my tire. Anyhow, Came in about 15 min after they closed. The shop manager was very helpful and had my tire fixed in less than 20 min. Yeah, I had to pay $185 but the fact that they were willing to help me after hours says a lot about this shop.
5	Wish I could remember the employee which sold me my last set of tires.  He was very informative and recommended Bridgestone Potenza's for my car.  LOVE them and love Discount Tire, always have fixed my tires for free and quickly.
5	These guys always do a great job. Best place to buy new tires or just have the tire pressure checked. The associate Michael is a pretty awesome guy and always takes great care of us. Need tires these are the guys to go to.
5	They impressed me!  I brought my Mazda in because two tires kept losing air and would go flat within a couple of days. Both tires are less than a year old and I was hoping they could be repaired.  They tested both tires and couldn't find any leaks so they replaced the valves.  They didn't charge me a dime and the tires are no longer leaking.  I don't know of anywhere else in Vegas that would do that.  When it's time to get new tires, that is where I will be going!
5	Good service!
5	Great service, fast and no charge for patching up my tire!!! I had a screw stuck in my tire. Did I mention that there was no charge for this service... I would recommend this place to everyone and I will be back for when I need new tires for sure!
5	I brought my car in to have a flat fixed.  Free of charge, they say.  Theory being that if they fix your tire for free, you'll come back to buy one later. I was down with that, so I ordered a set. They tell me they are on back order.  I get home, and the opposite side tire is now flat.  I'm thinking that they rotated the tires and didn't fix the flat right.I call them, tell them to cancel the order.  After all, if they can't fix a flat right, I'm not ordering $500 per tire tires from them.  The manager gets on the phone and says that he "wants to earn back my business."  He tells me to bring the tire in, he will fix it again, and he will give me a discount on my tire order to make things right.  I give him a shot.  30 mins later, we figure out it was not his fault after all.  There just happened to be a nail in the other tire too.  Bummer.  I tell him "ok, I will still buy the tires from you, but you don't need to give me the discount -- the purpose of the discount was to apologize for your mistake.  since you didn't make a mistake, don't give me a discount."He was not only gracious about MY mistake -- he insisted on giving the discount anyhow.  This place is a class operation.  No feeling of entitlement or shoddy work here.  I will be buying all my family's tires here.
5	Fast courteous service. State of the art equipment. Overstaffed, and had two guys working on my tires. They were real friendly, and finished 20 minutes from when I got towed in.
5	What a great job. I'll start off by saying the initial phone call. Quick answer, courteous and happy sounding.  I asked how much it would cost for a TPMS to be replaced in my Infiniti. The guy said 75 after taxes. I was like oh ok and then how much for installation? He said that is installed. Immediatly I booked an appointment.  Within 10 minutes of my appointment my car was being worked on by not just one tech but TWO!  While having my car attended to I was given water and a great viewing seat on the garage watching the techs literally run back and forth and working diligently. Talk about hustle!  While waiting the sales managers were speedily helping others and not once did someone walk out mad or feeling ripped off. The place is clean and friendly. One negative is no free wifi (sometimes this is a must for auto repair places because it can take a while) but that's not important just something they may offer in future!My car was taken off the life within 35-45 minutes, I was very happy at the speed and also the fact that they shined my tires (for free).  I felt valued and to wrap it up, my total was 75. Then the employee named Colton mentioned they scanned my other TPMS on my other three tires (for free again). The manager after I paid said thank you for coming in and gave me a solid handshake.I highly recommend them and will definitely be going to them again!
3	A week after my tire was fixed my light came back on. I fully plan on going and getting my money back and or having my money carried over since I asked the if the tire and wheel was fine before leaving and they assured me yes. Following review forth coming
5	Been using discount since 97 on my 76 Malibu and my now 05 sentra. Always great service. Last time I was there they just checked to see if a nail in my tire actually broke through and it didn't, so saved me $. Why go somewhere else when they are the best!
5	**Price Comparison for the SAME TIRES**       - Tire Works - $780        - Tire Works after "manager's special" and telling me they'd lose money on me - $646       - Discount Tires - $578**Summary**       - Price - Most places claim to beat all the prices out there, but the sales guy assured me that they are ACTUALLY obligated to lower their prices.       - Service - Fast and friendly. If you've had a bad experience at any other tire place, the experience you get here is like night and day.       - Helpful - They are knowledgeable and very helpful. I came in asking for tires that I got last time but the sales guy actually recommended lower cost tires to me that would last longer.**Recommendations**       - I would definitely recommend this place, especially to others who don't know too much about tires and brands. I've tried 3 other places in the valley and this tops them all hands down.
4	Which ever part of town we end up living in, we always head to the nearest Discount Tire for all our tire needs.My husband recently got 4 new tires for his car, got the road hazard coverage. It was so needed, after a year got a nail in his tire which was not fixable, the insurance covered the new tire, just needed to pay for installation.I desperately  needed new tires on my car, I didn't want to pay a butt load but I still wanted decent tires since I have a performance vehicle. They had great prices on what I needed. Got the tires on in an hour. Very nice, helpful staff.
4	Always great deals on tires.  Every time I have price shopped, even with the llantarias , discount tire always wins.  THey are all over town and I feel that they are very helpful and don't try to screw you over.  Only complaint is that sometimes the wait is too long.
5	Usually I leave the "car stuff" for my husband to handle because I always feel like I'm getting jipped or taken advantage of. However, my tire blew out and I knew I was way overdue on getting all of my tires replaced so I decided to try my luck with Discount Tire.When I called, they were extremely courteous and provided their names for personalized service. I went in the next morning and everyone there was friendly and treated me with respect. I believe I got a decent price for my tires and they were good about explaining the differences of the tires that work for my car. Their waiting area is very clean and they offer Keurig coffee! I was in and out in about half an hour. This place gets five stars all the way!
5	This team was great.  Anthony was very helpful and kept his word. I went in for a new tire.  Anthony told me I would be out of there 35-40 min most.  Absolutely no over promise nor under deliver!!!!
4	I've come here before when my tires blew out a year ago. I replaced all 4 tires and got the "hazard" warranty. The guys that helped me were very friendly and got my tires up and attt'em in no time.This past week, I got into a stupid accident where I needed to replace my rim and a couple tires on the driver's side.I believe Ron helped me. He was extremely friendly and happily informed me that I only needed to pay for my rim. Turns out my tires were free because I had gotten the "hazard" warranty. I was soooooo happy =) Anytime I get something done to my car, I'm always afraid of what kinda upsale they're gonna spit at me.  Within 15/20 mins, I was outta there and headed to work. I only spent about $150 which was much better than what my mind was estimating this accident was going to cost me.
5	Finally time to get new tires since mine are bald from driving back and forth to CA. I chose this location because of its proximity to my house. The staff was friendly and eager to help me. The salesman gave me a few options of tires to chose from depending on brand and price and my driving style. I was in and out with a new set within an hour. The waiting room was clean and comfortable. I was offered a water while I waited. I liked that the salesman was not pushy and listened to all of my questions/concerns.
5	I am a little nervous writing a review the same day as the service, I mean for all I know my wheel could fly off and kill someone 2 days from now, but what the heck. I will just update if it turns out they were actually doing a shady job and I was too stupid to notice...Anyway, like everyone else says, they are incredibly friendly and I felt very well taken care of. I needed 4 new tires, and I called around to a lot of places. There were some cheaper ones at Pep Boys, but they were shady about things on the phone and I had a bad vibe so I went to Discount instead. He showed me several options and we picked the best one for my budget and mileage. When I told him the price was still a little high for me, he did some computer magic and got me where I needed to be, which I greatly appreciate.I really liked being able to sit at the "car bar" Seriously, they have a giant window where you can slide up, take a seat, and see everything that is going on with your car. Might be BS, but it gave me the impression that they weren't trying to hide shady stuff behind closed doors, and it was interesting to watch. They got everything done very quickly, I don't think I was there for even 30 minutes, which was great. Also, I have free rotations and flat fixes, which comes in handy with all the nails that like to jump into my tires in Vegas. Overall, a very pleasant experience at a (gasp!) car place :-)
5	Great deal. Ryan was very helpful and honest.
4	fast, efficient, and friendly :)My friend had a flat on the way to vegas and we came here to fix his tires! The guys here were super helpful and they were super quick with replacing the tires. We were in and out of there in half hour, so I would recommend them for your tire needs!
5	I had an amazing experience here just this morning. I had gotten a flat tire while camping and couldn't find the puncture myself. I took it in and they thoroughly checked the tire and finally found a very small nail in it. They then repaired it, took off the spare and put the original tire back on for me - at no cost! They also wouldn't accept a tip, even though I insisted! Such great customer service, I had to jump on Yelp and write my first review about them!
5	I paid for four new tires and had them installed by the Windmill Discount Tire, their work was very, very bad. They threw my valve caps away, I got the new tires without the caps. The balance was way off on all four tires, and the weights were falling off. Also the way they put on the weights on dug deep scratches in my wheels. I didn't  want to go back and have the same bad and sloppy service again, so I went to the new Blue Diamond Discount Tire. They rebalanced and checked my tires, thank you Anthony and the crew at Blue Diamond store. I will go back to them again.PM
4	Been here multiple times for my s2k.Always have good service and okay pricing. Not the best pricing but decent. They had no problem stretching 245/40/18 tires onto my 10.5 inch rim
5	Awesome! The service was fast. It was efficient. The team was careful with my car - even wiping down the wheels after installation. However, the number one reason for this review is the service. I purchased a set of four new tires for my vehicle. After driving for a few days, I was sure that I had a tire issue - not sure if it was the tire, balance, etc. But I could feel it. I returned to the store, explained my issue - and admitted that it was very, very minor - but I was very picky. The Mgr took the vehicle for a test drive and he couldn't feel anything; however, instead of dismissing me - he said he was going to rebalance the tires. And he did - and during that process, he discovered that the issue wasn't the tire - but the wheel. Minor - but he did find it and suggested a repair. Yes, I was very pleased with the service.
4	Well, I needed tires & new rims so I called these guys to check on pricing. I talked to a guy named Ryan and he gave me a decent quote and told me to come in as soon as I wanted to. He met me in the parking lot and walked me in as he discussed the tires. He showed me the rims and even held them up side by side to help me decide which ones to choose. I'd been here 3 years ago and the service was terrible. I was reluctant to try them again but glad I did. They were fast, friendly, and very helpful. They even gave me a cheaper price than originally quoted. I will definitely use them again. :)
5	The best service I've ever received at a tire place. Ryan, was so knowledgeable. He was funny and very willing to help, honest and trustworthy! I will recommend anyone of my friends or family members to go to this specific store and see Ryan. He helped me find the best tires, at a discounted price. This was the best service ever. I can't express how happy I am. I will be going back!
1	As a business owner, I have purchased a great number tires from Discount Tire. I've done so because of the service and warranties. My last experience while getting a tire repaired has led me to seriously reconsider where I purchase tires in the future. In August 2012, I purchased 4 tires with warranties for my wife's minivan. In less than 25,000 miles, the two front tires have worn on the edges to the point that your salesmen strongly recommended changing them pointed out the severe risk of separation. Having purchased the warranties and based on previous experience with Discount Tire, I assumed they would cover them without any issues. Apparently, I was wrong. They said it was caused by a lack of rotation and not a warranty repair and I could buy new tires for the front (In fairness, they did offer some discount). I know that failure to rotate tires (especially in that time frame) does not wear a tire to the point of potential separation!  I have brought countless vehicles into Discount Tire and in every instance when I've asked them to rotate the tires they've told me it wasn't necessary at the moment. So you can understand my frustration when hearing that failure to rotate is the reason they won't warranty the tires. After they repaired the tire they delivered the vehicle to my wife who was outside. Once again emphasizing the danger of not replacing the two tires. So you ask, did they at least take the opportunity to rotate the tires while they had the chance and since it is SO IMPORTANT? NO!, they didn't feel it was necessary!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!  As far as I'm concerned, I'd rather buy 4 new tires from another company than to sink another penny into swapping the 2 tires from discount if this is the level of service I can expect to receive. All in all, I left with the feeling that the sale was definitely more important than the customer service. Hope this helps others.
1	I wish I could give these pigs zero stars!  I've been going to the Discount Tire on Maryland Parkway for the better part of 14 years and they are always amazing, extremely helpful and fast.  I recently moved to the Southwest side of town and this is the closest Discount Tire for me.  I went to get my tires rotated and balanced- it took an hour and cost $45.  Huh?!  I went to purchase new tires for my RV and they said they were a special order.  I asked them to order them.  3 days later no phone call so I called them.  The tires were never ordered so I asked again that they be ordered.  Another 3 days goes by (6 total days!) and no phone call.  I called them again and they had no update or record of ordering the tires.  Being extremely irritated I then went across the street to Ted Weins and not only were the tires NOT special order but they had them in stock!!  And, they let me buy them!  So crazy...These guys are happy to help you if you are a lady with a low cut shirt or if you have a monster truck and are looking to drop a few grand on new tires and rims.  I will never go to any Discount Tire again - except for the one on Maryland Pkwy.  They are amazing!!
4	This is the third time I've been to this location. I've always received great service.  Very polite, courteous & fast.  The first time I visited, I bought 2 tires. The next time I visited, I had a nail in my tire & they were able to fix it.  Which was great because I thought they'd tell me that I had to buy a new tire, but they were honest.  This time, I needed 2 more tires so they matched it up with the other 2 & I got new 2 tires. I will definitely be back & recommend them to my friends!
4	"Sick and Tired"I showed up one morning with four Michelin tires--one in the trunk, two in the backseat, the other riding shotgun. I needed the new meat mounted and balanced, the old meat discarded and disposed save for one(I have plans for it in my yard, you see).I had called earlier and told the dude what I wanted and he said 80 bucks. I parked the Cobra by its lonesome and walked inside. Saw a dude and asked if he was THE dude I had talked to earlier. He said he was. He looked at my car and said it was sick. I nodded and asked what he drove. He told me and we spent ten minutes talking cars and bikes. He goes into the garage, barks a few orders, and a guy pulls my ride into the bay. Almost immediately four guys are on it like flies on shit. They located the proper jack points and carefully raised the beast. As I waited another dude walks in from the garage. Starts asking about the snake. We got to talking about cars, racing, Hawaii and how much Vegas sucks after a year or two.Thirty minutes later the wench was ready. I paid and said adios. Walked out to the idling thunder and calmly drove away.
5	Fast, honest and friendly. Thank you guys!!! They came over to the shop next door to even give me a price when I was getting my oil changed. Every employee there was helpful and very friendly! Will be coming back and sending people here!
5	Very kind people.. Listen and answer your questions.  Roy was very friendly.  He came to greet me outside and went right to work on my tire.  Every time is come in this store, they are always professional and so helpful.
5	Returned to Discount Tire again to have another set of wheels and tires mounted and balanced with TPMS, and to make things worse they were aftermarket 22" wheels that needed bands to mount the TPMS correctly. The two gentlemen to ask for when you go in Anthony or Colton, as on my visits both were professional and nothing short of a pleasure to work with. I know my car isnt the easiest to work on but never did i get a sense of irritation or unwillingness to do the job the right way for me. I know in most cases thats not saying much as its to be expected, but the way you get treated at many places... its amazing people still have their jobs in this city. So thumbs up to Discount and the crew that works here. Thanks, you have earned my trust every time.
4	Update:Within 20 minutes of placing my previous review, I was contacted by the store manager. They promptly offered to exchange the 2 front tires free of charge. They took me right in when I arrived and had me back on the road in no time.
1	Been going to discount tire since I started driving at the age of 16. (11 years ago this month) I have never had a problem with them. I usually go to the shop on Tropicana and Jones but I live in southern highlands now so I go to the blue diamond rd store. I took my car in there last month for tires. I was met by the assistant manager, a young man mid 20s or so I believe his name was Mark. He gave me the info I needed and the tires I needed for my car and the experience was great and quick. Went back last week cause my truck has felt like it has a rock or something in my tire and it is veering off to the left pretty bad as well as tire rotation was needed now anyways. I get to discount tire on blue diamond rd and once again met by Mark or w/e the assistant managers name was and he remembered me got to talking about football a bit since my truck is decked out in GB Packer stuff and he ended up being a Vikings fan. (Go figure) After he looks at my tires he tells me my tires are to big for my rims. ( I have 24 inch rims) I think nothing of it and say great how much to get the proper tires. We go back inside he gets me a couple quotes on tires. $1,400.00 for 4 new tires to fit my rims or $1,200.00 for new rims and tires. I say let me think about it. Week later (today) I take my truck in to Georges Alignment and brakes, less then a hour goes by and I get a call from them. Turns out my alignment is fine as well as my tire balance is okay. My front right tire is ready to separate though as they put it. I have a defective tire with a good amount of tread left but cracks and rip right on the edge of the tire that is visible if you are looking at the tires up close. (which I never did/do thats why I usually go to discount tire). Some how the assistant manager Mark was able to look at my truck for a good 10-15 minutes and not see the cracks or the piece of tire that is flapping. He somehow noticed that my tires were to big even though they have been there since 2011 and the truck was checked out by Towbin Dodge and the Chopper himself before I bought it just to be safe since I did buy the truck used. I should not of even been driving the truck the tire is so bad. Thankfully Georges Alignment and Brake people were smarter then this so called assistant manager of a tire store or I could be driving my truck on the freeway right now and have a major blow out and possible accident with injury or death because the Blue Diamond rd discount tire store decided to promote a young incompetent assistant manager who isn't even paying attention to his job and is only focused on making sales instead of the safety of the customer. I have thought about calling the Higher ups at discount tire but that will most likely do no good what so ever so I will let everyone know my experience there and why I would not recommend ever going to this discount store.I was able to also get 2 new tires from of Towbin fiat for around $350.00 out the door while Discount Tire wanted $350.00 for a single tire.
5	Patched my tire free of charge. Quick service, excellent staff!
1	Twice I've came here to get my pressure check in my tires. Several guys just walk right by and glance at me. They weren't even busy at the time. And some were huddled around talking and laughing. They never came to me and asked if I've been helped or if I needed help. Worst customer service ever. The one who ended up helping me was very helpful and kind. He came out to help me when he was inside. Maybe all the employees should take note on this guys customer service. The guys name was Roy. He was very helpful
5	Wonderful, helpful, honest, kind, and very fast. These guys exemplified great customer service and knowledge when it came to changing our boat trailer tire. We were met with a smile, and the assistant manager Anthony took the time to inspect all of our tires and make sure we were all set before leaving. The location is great also and easy to drive around with a trailer. Our family HIGHLY recommends this discount tire! They will take care of you and it's affordable too. We left with a smile and comfort knowing we could get back on the road to California safely.
5	Went in with a bolt in the sidewall of a brand new tire. Anthony jumped right on it, popped a new tire on and Back in the road in less than 30 mins. Great experience
5	Service was fast and friendly.  They were not going to charge for a tire repair but I still gave them a tip.
5	Great customer service!!!!  I usually avoid going to corporate tire shops because they always try to upsale you.  At discount tires Jean Luc was my service represented, he was great, explained everything to me clearly and told me about the certificate you can purchase for your tires!!!  Overall great experience, I would recommend going to discount tires!
5	Amazing customer service! I had screws in 3 of my tires. Thankfully they were still open when I got off work. They were able to patch two of the tires so I had to buy one. I got my tires with them before so they were under warranty! I was expecting to have to buy all new tires and only spent $20!  The wait wasn't bad either! Thanks Bryan and Jean Luc!!!
5	Best service that I have ever seen!! If you go see Jean Luc. Luc was professional and provided the information I needed. Sometimes other shops offer things/ services you don't need, but not here. I will only do business with Discount Tires.
5	A huge shoutout to Anthony who saved the day. I was told by Goodyear that I needed to replace all 4 of my tires so I went to Discount Tire for a second opinion. Anthony was great. He checked all of my tires, was upfront and honest and didn't try to take advantage of a sale. Turned out my tires were still good! So before I left Anthony put air in my tires free of charge. If you're in need of new tires or anything tire related, go see Anthony and the team at Discount Tire!!
5	This is my tire shop. I've been here three times, and the sales people never try to sell you what you don't need. They did tire rotations and repaired nail holes free of charge. trustworthy, honest people. And the tire prices are very good. GO HERE for your next tire.
5	Anthony is great on the phone and in person. Needed a rare trailer tire. I called to see if they had on stock. They did. And matched a competitor's price. I was in and out in less than 10mins. Clean facility. Again Anthony was great help.
5	Really quick service!I walked in and even though it was busy, I was attended to within 5 minutes. The workers are all super nice and courteous and had me in and out of there in less than a half hour. AMAZING.
5	Five stars!  I needed new tires very badly and this Discount Tire location was knowledgable and patient- with all my questions and quite a few phone calls... I shopped around a lot and they were still the best price.  Unfortunately when I arrived they weren't showing me the correct estimate.  Assistant Manager Jean Luc was helping me and eventually he did find the previous estimate in the computer, though it took a while.  I was trying hard to stay patient myself but he believed what I claimed and didn't give up on searching.  Then it turned out that the estimate given over the phone accidentally didn't include the TPMS fee, and the total cost is a big deal to me so he very kindly and quickly overrode it!  I was waiting and waiting for an opportunity to buy these tires, and here they painlessly stood by their misquote without making me feel cheap... Thanks to Jean Luc I'm safer again on the roads, and I will be back!
5	Had to get my tires fixed, had a nail inside it . Only took them about 35min, and they rotated and adjusted the air in my tires . I would defiantly go back for other car issues . (:
3	I wasn't very impressed with the particular customer service we have received today - I don't know if he was tired, sick, simply had a bad day, or just naturally condescending... but his head was elsewhere. He saw us came in, and he didn't even care to let us know that the car was good to go. This is why I give 3 stars instead of 5. Other than that, he sold us 2 tires for 200 bucks, he was not pushy at all, and that's basically ALL we expect from tire places like this. Firestone staff was super nice but he told us that we needed to buy ALL four tires for $630 (unsure of the service was included). I would much rather want to deal with unfriendly discount tire employees and keep the extra bucks in my pocket.
1	My spare tire wasnt put back, got another flat and there i was, stuck in the vegas heat with no spare tire
1	We entered this store for a simple repair of a slow leak. From the start of our conversation the associate only wanted to inform us of the tires he could sell us. This went on for several minutes when we said we just need a repair. We were then informed that we would need to purchase new tires because the store didn't have the supplies to repair the tire. The next day I took my vehicle to Big O. The tire was repaired within 30 minutes free of charge I might add. The hard sale may be a positive business model for Discount Tires but for me and my family of over 10 vehicles we will never set foot in another Discount Tire.
1	Don't bother stepping foot into this place if you value your time. Customer service leaves a lot to be desired, and I just finished waiting over two hours to get a small leak repaired. AVOID THIS STORE
4	I don't usually write reviews, I just read them. But sometimes I like to take the time to write something since I am in the customer service industry too. To keep it short and sweet, my experience with discount tire store did not start off well, but it ended on a good note and to me that is what matters. Two of my friends recommended this place to me so I took their word for it. Anthony and his staff were very nice and understanding about the issue with my car. I am happy to say that it is fixed and it did not take long. :)
5	I stopped by to have my tires checked and rotated. I didn't have an appointment and was in and out within thirty minutes. The second time I came I had a damn nail in my freakin' tire! Kill me! Thankfully I had certificates and my tire was replaced for less than $20!! Cannot beat that! Plus service was super speedy. He said there were a few cars ahead of me and it would probably take about a half hour but I was outta there within twenty minutes! The guys here are great. Super friendly, great customer service. I definitely recommend!
5	I came by yesterday for a quote on tires for my Hyundai Gen Coupe and spoke with Bryan. His customer service was fantastic. He got the tires I wanted ordered immediately. They came in today and I just stopped by to have them put on and spoke with Anthony, who's customer service was more amazing than the day before! He knew who I was the moment I walked in the store. He was able to educate me on the tires I purchased and talk with me about my car. The crew who changed the tires did it within 30 minutes. By far, the best experience I have ever had buying tires! I highly suggest this location because of their customer service alone. I'll for sure be a returning customer. Thank you Anthony & Bryan!
5	I've used Discount Tire in general, both in Vegas and in Indianapolis. The company itself is stellar in my experience. From the mid west to here, they're always considerate, nice and informative. My experience at the Blue Diamond Rd. Discount Tire, in LV....- I had run over a construction nail at the intersection of Durango and Blue Diamond a few days prior. It wasn't causing a leak but it was deep in there and I could see I definitely needed to get it fixed fast. I did/do have 4 brand new tires , which, I also purchased and installed via Discount Tire in Indianapolis. I had the protection plan, for 2 full tire replacements. However, this did not require it. I dropped it off, the manager on duty personally introduced himself, came out and took a look with a smile....I gave him my keys and i grabbed some food by time I was done eating, the truck was already fixed , parked and ready to go. No charge and they were nothing but fast, efficient, informative and very polite. Definitely using them again.

5	I've been here three times this year. Once just to have a tire checked and twice to actually replace tires on both of my cars. These guys are always extremely polite and professional. Most of all they're honest. I know nothing about tires so, after my regular mechanic tried to upsell me on new tires, I came here and they said I didn't even need them for another year.
5	Great store.  I always buy my tires from them.  What gives them 5 stars vs 4 is the free air check.  Annually at this time of year I get a low air light.  They cheerfully check the air in all 5 tires every time.  One of my sensors is bad so they have to also reset all of them or the light won't go out.  There's no hassle and they don't make you wait long at all (I wouldn't blame them - they do have paying customers there as well).  I'll never go any place else for my tires ever again.
5	Can't say enough how much these guys rock. They remember who I am, they treat me and my cars with respect, and they do quality work with quality products.If you ever need tires or rims or anything related to them, you'd be a fool to go anywhere else.
5	Great experience with these guys! I realized I had a slow leak in my tire about 10 days ago and after looking for reviews on Yelp took my car to them. Everyone in the shop was very pleasant and they looked at the tire within fifteen minutes of my arrival. Turned out that the rim actually had a small crack in it, so they brought me into the shop and showed it to me, so I could see the issue. They then explained the options were to go to the dealership to get a new one or they could try and find a refurbished rim. They quickly searched for a refurbished rim for me and quoted me a price. I told them I wanted to look at my options for a day or two before I dropped over $300 on a refurbished rim for an 8 year-old car with a lot of miles on it. They told me it was not a problem and suggested even searching online myself to see if there might be a better price on Ebay, etc. They provided me with all of the info I needed about the rim to search for it and find the right one. I left for the day with no charge. They also told me that they would top off the air in the tire whenever I needed it, as it still had the slow leak when I left. I went home, searched online and found a replica wheel online for about 1/3 of the price of the refurbished OEM one they had found. I called back to the shop to ask if they would put it on for me if I bought it online and they said that the cost would be $20. As I know little to nothing about car rims, I asked if the replica was something I should buy or if OEM made a difference. I was told it was probably very similar quality and I should go with it for that kind of savings. I ordered it that day and received it yesterday, looking just like the ones I have. This afternoon I went in and they put the new one on, inflated the tire and I was gone in 15 minutes. To top it off, NO CHARGE again! They told me it was their pleasure and that they would just see me when I need new tires.What great customer service and building business the right way. Thanks to the guys at Discount Tire for saving me over $300 compared to what I would have paid if I had gone to the dealership. I will be back with my car and my wife's when we need tires. Thanks!!!
5	Their #1 priority seems to be customer service. I was greeted from the time I parked to the door. I was offered a bottle of water while I wait and was thanked for my service. The prices for the reasonable. I'll be returning for any tire maintenance needed. Thanks guys
