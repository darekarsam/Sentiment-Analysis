5	Believe it or not, I was planning on doing a review of this Pittsburgh landmark before the big news that Warren Buffett's billions was buying Heinz. Dear Warren Buffett, don't mess with my ketchup!FACT: Heinz Ketchup is used in 93% of restaurants, nation wide!The HJ Heinz company was formed in 1869 when Henry John Heinz sold his mother's canned horseradish door to door. Today Heinz's headquarters are still here in Pittsburgh, although no products are made in Pittsburgh anymore. The plant at the base of Troy Hill near the Allegheny river was sold to Treehouse Foods where they make private label soups. I'll never forget going to the factory as a Cub Scout and how the vinegar smelled as we toured the factory. We each got a full size bottle of Ketchup to take home with us, and of course a Pickle Pin, one of the most iconic symbols associated with Heinz.Again, Mr Buffett, don't mess with the red stuff or a whole gaggle of Terrible Towel waving Yinzers will open a can of whoop ass on ya!
5	Heinz ketchup and pickles are terrific.  It isn't worth trying to save a nickel with watery condiments.
5	Heinz has been the populist concept of ketchup for about a century.Whether it's a diner in Iowa or India, you have it by your side. It makes french fries, hotdogs, and even rice so sweet. At a restaurant, there's nothing like that brings out the five year old in even the kale lovers as to dip chicken strips in ranch and the french fries in the Heinz. They use real tomatoes while other companies use real bits of Frankenstein's neck.They are what makes eating so caloric and so special.Heinz is part of life for a reason.
