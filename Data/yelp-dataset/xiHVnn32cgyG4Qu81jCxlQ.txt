4	Rural Hill is a 265 acre nature preserve & farm, which is open for tours, festivals, weddings, sheepdog trails, walking, & field trips. It's also home to the "Amazing Maize Maze." Today's visit brought Milo & I here for the "Bark in the Park" festival. For the second year in a row, I'm really impressed at the layout. Festivals are held behind (& around) all the historical buildings on the property. There's plenty of parking, as well.  There's so much to do here outside of festivals.  It's worth reviewing their website, or checking out a festival being held there.
4	Let's face it -- it's out there, man. Way out there. You're not in Huntersville anymore. It's a huge plot that spans acres of land outside of Huntersville and close to parts of Lake Norman. Just outside of the 485 loop. Houses many family-friendly events and others of note:Warrior DashAmazing Maize Maze (Fall)Other festivals of sorts. It's a great spot for education, too. There are old schoolhouses, farmlands, tons of walking trails, and other nature-centric activities. Check it out even when there isn't some event or other hoopla.
4	What a nice location for events. Just make sure you have sun lotion or a hat. Not much shade so if you have or bring pets beware.  We have been there a few times and enjoy it. Stone soup day on January 1st is the best. What a lovely event
