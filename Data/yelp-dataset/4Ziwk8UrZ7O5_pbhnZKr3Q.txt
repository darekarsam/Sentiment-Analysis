5	We had such a great time here! Regina was so sweet with the kids! We will definitely be coming back again!! The cookies were so yummy and even better with the milk! Thank you for such a fun time!!
5	We had my daughter's 9th birthday at the Cookie Doughjo on Saturday. It was the easiest birthday party we have ever done. We arrived and Regina had the place decorated and even had on music to go with my daughter's theme. The staff is very helpful. The kids all had a great time and the cookies turned out wonderful.
5	Great place to bring your kids!! (: lots of fun baking cookies and decorating boxes! And the best part? No mess to clean up! ;)
5	I read really great reviews about this place so I decided to bring my niece and nephews here. At first they were skeptical about baking because they thought it wouldn't be as fun as a trampoline park or Peter Piper Pizza. I dragged them along anyways and their opinions immediately changed when they were given the opportunity to choose the type of cookies to make. The ladies working there were very nice, professional, and knew how to interact with kids. They were always available whenever we needed help and they made the experience very fun. I will be bringing the kids back here again someday.
