4	This restaurant is located west of downtown, just south of Mont Royal. Everything we had was well prepared from very fresh ingredients, and served in generous portions.  Didn't taste any MSG in any of the dishes. Service was prompt and unobtrusive...the classic style of service you get from older male Chinese waiters.A nice dining experience, and a pleasant surprise, given that I had driven by the restaurant several times without ever stopping in.
5	This restaurant has been opened since forever. It's always our go to spot when we have cravings for chinese. Located in the area of cote-des-neiges, this restaurant is a true gem. Food is always fresh and service is OK. My family has been going here for over 15 years now. Good for big groups & family gatherings. The only thing I'd change is the porc chop..it's good but I want REAL salt & pepper porc chop..they one that taste like curry! They also offer free delivery!Cheers to Kenny & Eric.
4	Seems like everytime that I visit family in Montreal, we go to this Chinese restaurant.  This is our relatives favorite spot, and they always get plenty of food!  Got to admit that I do not know the names of most of the dishes.  I never get to order anything cause the family orders everything.  I just pig out!   Also, I can say that everything has been tasting really good!  Service has been great as well!I always look forward to family taking us here!  Clean restaurant, delicious food, and good service adds up to 4 stars!  Yes, I am a fan.
