1	I'm not sure about this company, but I doubt if I would hire them as I have witness the tech spend less then 5 min. at a neighbors house. He spent more time sitting in the truck then he did around the pool . I wont rate this company until I see for my own eyes that this tech did work on the pool
1	Have been using this service for a month. Each weekend my family would go out to use the pool the floor of the pool would not be clean and would be cloudy if used. Having a party planned for this weekend so I called to simply ask if it could be for sure cleaned up for the weekend and I was given major attitude. Not once was I rude to this guy and he snapped at me for no reason. He stated he doesn't like to be told he is not doing his job and that he would terminate my service so I could find someone who could clean my pool. I would not recommend anyone use his service due to his bad attitude and bad service.
5	Eileen is amazing! She runs a great business. I give her many referrals and all those have been beyond satisfied :)
