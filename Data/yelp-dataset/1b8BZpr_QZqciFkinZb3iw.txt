3	The staff are nice but seem to be busy working then helping the customer. They have a great selection of bedding, curtains and bathroom decor. Unfortunately, they were sold out of the color and length that we needed, so we went elsewhere.
4	They have so much selections of house decors and house stuff. We bought curtains from here and its nice not having to pay so much for curtains. they had so many different colors to choose from... I'm planning on changing up the colors in the near future and I'm almost positive i'll be coming here for new curtains. and... even better, military discount! yipee :)
5	The associates at this store are very friendly and helpful. From the moment I walked in at the door to when I checked out I was greeted and it was a speedy check out.when I had questions I got an answer right away. They have great customer service. They had all the items that I needed. I will return to this location.
4	Abby was very helpful and sweet. We were looking for window panels to redecorate and we found the perfect panel but they only had 3 left and we needed four and one was the display model...Abby got on the phone and called the other stores intown and found the panels, all 4! She had them held for us! Great job! Made our day!
