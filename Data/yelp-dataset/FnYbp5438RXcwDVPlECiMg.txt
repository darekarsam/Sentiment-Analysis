5	Wow!  Jennifer does amazing color!!!! My hair is impossible to color, the color never stay's so it seemed like it was always a waist of money! . Jen said "give me a shot. .. you'll be happy!" THAT was an understatement! My hair is amazing! ! Thanks Jen!! I send everyone I know to you!
5	Originally created a yelp account so I could put a crappy business on blast but I love my nail tech so much I had to sing her praises.Here we go: since the first time I had my nails done by Lauren, I haven't gone to anyone else. She is a creative genius, through and through. I hardly give Lauren any direction and she runs wild with beautiful and festive creations for both acrylics and gels. It just doesn't get any better.I highly recommend Lauren for all of your nail needs!!
5	Jennifer does wonderful color and cuts.  I just wish I could take her with me to blow dry my hair.  She does excellent work!
5	Jennifer is the best! My hair came out the perfect color, soft and shiny! She is excellent with blondes and did my full highlight and low light. The experience is something note worthy and sets her apart from other salons. (There is vino ;-)
5	I have been going to Jennifer for years now and I would never trust anyone else to do my hair. She always knows exactly what you want with little direction and the color is always AMAZING!! I love the salon atmosphere, very cute and cozy :)
