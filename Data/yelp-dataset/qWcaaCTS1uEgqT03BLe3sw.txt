5	My family has stayed at My Place a few times this spring.  It is very quaint establishment.  The grounds are great.  We used the BBQ and had a bonfire in the pit.  The owners are very friendly and make you feel at home.
5	Very sweet little place. We were only able to stay 1 night due to travel schedule. Wish it could have been longer. Milla, the owner, greeted us and gave us a tour. This place is being tended with love. Very clean, comfortable and cozy. Bed is very comfortable. Large bath towels, which we really appreciate. We will go back again,
5	Very nice motel, reasonably priced and fully equipped. The new owner is very nice and hospitable, gave us a tour of options of rooms and has done a great job revamping the place. Landscaping was nice and the room had a full size fridge, stove, sink etc with pots and pans. Everything was clean and well kept. Soft linens, comfortable bed and pillows, nice sized TV and clean bathroom. The only thing I would change is in our suite room the window has blinds but no curtains; the bed is right next to the window and the lights are left on outside all night. So if you're like me and don't sleep well with light in the room, pick the bigger studio where the bed is in separate room (it was only $10 more a night). Other than that it FAR exceeded my expectations!
