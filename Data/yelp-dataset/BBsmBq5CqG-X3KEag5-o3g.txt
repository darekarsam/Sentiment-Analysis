1	I was so excited to check this place out. I was looking forward to watching some World Cup (something I love) while getting a haircut (something I hate). Walked in and they had 5 big screens...all playing hockey. Nothing wrong with hockey. But the season isn't even going on right now. They had replays of NHL games and not a single TV with the largest global sporting event on a single TV. You've got to be kidding. Noped out of there on principle. Even Fry's Food had the game on in their cafe area...and they don't have "Sport" in their name.
5	i've been here twice since they opened. i don't watch sports. i go because they have given me good haircuts. they have upgrade options for washing your hair after which is nice because having all that loose hair is annoying.you can get a hot towel and a brief shoulder massage for extra. but they have not let me down for a haircut.
3	I've had two haircuts at this place, and neither one was bad, but if I'm going to a cheap place I'll just stick w/Great Clips since they're...well, cheaper (and quite honestly I think they do a better job...the one by my house does, anyway).Quite frankly, I think the whole sports theme is a little gimmicky. When I go in to get a haircut I just want to get in & out (I have short hair so it doesn't take long to cut), so I can care less about a "theme," TV's, etc... This place tries and promote it's "extras" in addition to just a haircut (wash/shampoo, a neck massage, and I think one or two other things). They call it the "MVP." Eh. I mean, if you're into that and want to pay the five extra bucks, that's fine, but like I said, I just want my haircut and to be done. The two times I've had my haircut here, neither girl did a bad job, but they were no better than any other chain haircut place.
