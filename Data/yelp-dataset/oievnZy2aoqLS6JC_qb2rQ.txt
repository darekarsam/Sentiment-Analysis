5	Impressive slight of hand skills. Started off with some basic card tricks but quickly moved to some amazing tricks.
5	Armando Vera is an excellent close-up magician and an entertaining performer. His show is appropriate for all ages. We kept asking ourselves: "How did he do that?!"We were lucky to get seats right in front of him. I recommend getting in line early so you can get good seats. His tricks are all the more impressive when they are performed just inches from your face.Armando's show is an opening act for comedy magician, Nathan Burton - another great and recommended performer. We plan to return and see them again in a couple years. Hopefully they'll have some new tricks worked into their acts by then.
5	My kids (age 12 & 13) loved it.  We thoroughly enjoyed it as well.  The assigned VIP ticket seats are for Nathan Burton.  Armando's show is first come first serve.  I strongly recommend standing in line to get the best seats.  You will stand in line to get in, take a picture, then stand in line to get to the theatre. If you can't get front and center, I recommend to go for more center or right hand seats facing AV (we sat in the first row, on the left, but the music was a bit distracting.  However, my 2 kids and husband were selected to participate!  And... have a hundred dollar bill ready to take out, you will need it to participate (you will get it back).  I strongly recommend this show, if you like magic in an intimate setting, you will enjoy this!
