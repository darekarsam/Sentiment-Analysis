5	Barb is fantastic! All of the joys of working with a small business owner, great service at a great price.
5	Professional, experienced and kind. I have never been disappointed with her work. She listens, recommends and I walk out with great skin! She knows a lot about nutrition and the skin. I highly recommend her!!!
5	I am always impressed with the wealth of knowledge she has in regard to the relationship of nutrition and skin.  I'm a guy and can honestly say, every man should try a salon visit at least once. It's important to look good at every age!
5	I am very impressed and overwhelmed with the results and professional experience I receive every time I came in. I will never go to anyone else for facial care. Thank you Barb for being amazing at what you do.
