4	I've only had 4 visits, but I've already had a reduction in neck pain and migraines.  They can get you an appointment in a timely manner (you could probably get in the same day if you're having issues) and, as an added bonus, this office is the #1 Stillers fans ever.  Ever.Also, the doctor is a little bit nutty.  In a good way.
4	Dr. Smooke and his staff are amazing! They are so kind. Dr. Smooke is great, he really works with you. I never had a problem with making an appointment, and would sometimes walk in. I defiantly recommend Dr. Smooke to anyone who needs a great chiropractor.
4	I first started to see Dr. Smooke as my parents are long-time patients and they recommended him. And although I've been his patient a little under a year, I'm quite happy. The people at the desk are always friendly, nice and understanding. They are very flexible and accommodating for scheduling appointments. If you are looking for a more "business only" vibe and not up for an unpretentious, home-spun attitude, this may not be the place for you. Dr. Smooke has a bit of an eccentric, folksy, absent-minded professor style that I find enjoyable and comforting.
