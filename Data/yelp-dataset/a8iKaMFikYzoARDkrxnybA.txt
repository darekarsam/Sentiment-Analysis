4	This place is an institution; I'm sure it's been in the same awkward, T-straddling location since the dawn of time, scrubbing the grime off soccer moms' SUVs and dads' sedans. I will say that I was impressed by the newfangled card-reader and frequent-buyer system they've got going on; Grandma was impressed by the novelty of being conveyed through a sea of scrubbing bubbles.Pro tip: the little glass cleaner wipes they give away? Try leaving a few tucked into your front cupholder as a subtle hint that you live in, or near, Mt. Lebanon. Cheaper than a trip to pick up an OBX sticker for the rear windshield.
5	Always have friendly workers there. Well worth the money to just drive right in and your car comes out spotless every time!!
1	BEWARE!! This car wash damaged my 2008 Yukon Denali . Spoke with one of the owners, Justin, and he refused to work with me to get the damaged piece repainted. Do not believe that the "We Are Responsible" sign out in front means anything. The brushes are very rough on the vehicle. If you have a dark colored vehicle i would not use this car wash, go to a touchless.
