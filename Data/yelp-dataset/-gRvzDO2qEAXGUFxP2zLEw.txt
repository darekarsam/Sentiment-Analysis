3	I mean, American Apparel is a great place to window shop, however I don't think I would ever buy anything here because everything is overwhelmingly overpriced. $30 for a V-neck T-shirt? $20 for a belt? I don't think so; however, I do enjoy walking in here, taking a look around, and trying something on every once in a while. If not for buying, it's great to stop in to get a good sense of what trends/colors are in style. My advice: stop in here and use their stuff as a framework to tailor your own style when shopping somewhere else.
