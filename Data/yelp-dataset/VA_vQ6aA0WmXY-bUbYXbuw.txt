5	Do you need Mushrooms?  Special ones?  Do you love mushrooms?  Do you want to try special fancy exotic mushrooms like Matsutake and lobster mushrooms?  Here is nice fun special mushroom store for you.  So Amazing! I got bunch of dried mushrooms and made super yummy lasagnas and mushroom gnocchi.  My foodie husband loved it.  It's just fun to look at things in the store.  Great place to buy something unique and special things for friends who are super picky and foodie. This store is all about mushrooms! Did I tell you that I love mushrooms? :)
5	This store is so unique! I passed by a few times thinking it was a hippie mushroom store, but then noticed a sign in the window about mushroom harvesting tours. I finally went in and it's a very legitimate mushroom lovers/hunters/growers store. They have dried mushrooms for culinary and medicinal use, books, tools, novelty mushroom items, and lots more for a real mushroom professional.The staff were super nice and even made me some Chaga tea so I could try it. I will definitely be back on my next visit.
