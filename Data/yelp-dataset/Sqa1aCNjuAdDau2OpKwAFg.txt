4	This is a great butcher in the mile end area and the staff is also super nice. Also, if you're into coffee, they have great machines and coffee to buy.AND, the best part, every Friday they get a whole Porchetta, absolutely amazing!
4	Great butcher with pre-marinated steaks, homemade sausage, veal oxtail...!  If you don't see something in the counter, make sure to ask as they keep a lot in the back.
5	Are you kidding?  Chez Vito is a mainstay of the Mile End scene, the place where all the goodfellas pick up their steaks and roasts, their pork chops and shoulders, their scottaditi-style lamb chops, their organic birds, and their hot and sweet sausages.  Chez Vito is also an unbelievably friendly family-run establishment--so full of good old-fashioned bonhomie that the place is almost a parody of your classic old-school butcher shop.  Whole porchetta is served gratis on Saturdays, and it's especially tasty (and plentiful) when you show up early.  Oh, yeah:  they also happen to have a pretty impressive collection of taxidermy, if you're into that kinda thing.  If they carried any grass-fed meat, they'd get a 6/5.  Essential.
