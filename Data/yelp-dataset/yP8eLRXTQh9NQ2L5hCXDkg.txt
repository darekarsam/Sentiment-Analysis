5	Take Care Clinic - Betty Hahn APN- Best Clinic ever! They take Insurance!!! I never never get sick. I have been coughing and feeling as though I was getting the flu for a week. Taking OTC meds.. Not getting better but getting worse. I don't have a Dr.So I took a chance and waited for the Take Care Clinic to open at my Walgreen's in Fountain Hills.. Best decision ever. The PA- Ms. Betty Hahn was amazing- spending a lot of time with me and examining me and diagnosed me with Bronchitis and acute sinusitis and gave me prescriptions that were sent right to the in-house Pharmacy and I got my scripts right away. She also said I should stay home for 48 hours and gave me a note for work. Best Healthcare service I have ever received in my life. I would recommend this Take Care Clinic on Palisades Blvd to everyone and anyone even if you have a Dr. they make it so very easy just check in        on the computer and you go into a real patient room. Very private and very comfortable.. No waiting either..  I am feeling better already. Thank you.
1	Be careful at cash register.  I bought items which were clearly marked $12.99 and when I checked the receipt at home I was charged $16.99.  NOT COOL.
