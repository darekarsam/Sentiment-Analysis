5	I came here for drinks and I ended up buying my stripper's house on Roosevelt and making a huge profit.I just called STILETTO's to ask them what a STILETTO was because I can't seem to get an answer I approve of..I said, 'What's a STILETTO?'The nice girl on the other end said a STILETTO is, 'a woman's dancing high heel'..isnt that cute.  ?!STILETTO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) :0 ;)
4	Awesome little spot. Great drink specials, talkative and friendly dancer, $5 table dances, $10 booth dances, $25 VIP, and to top it off, only a $5 cover!

4	A night and day difference when Stiletto's used to be Teasers.  Much more clean and safe inside.  The patio is a nice place to go to talk with friends when a break is needed from the table dances.  Dances are attractive and nice.  Not quite Christie's quality but very genuine and sweet.  Plus you just can't beat the $3 you-call-its.  Overall, Stiletto's is like the Cheers of strip clubs.
