5	Love Tres Amigos!  So many of my favorite accent pieces as well as lamps have come from there.  Sorry they closed the Scottsdale Road store.  I would go in there every week not expecting to find something but always did.  Today, I finally got to the Peoria store looking sconces.  No luck on them but found a lamp that was love at first site.  Had to buy it!  Love Tres Amigos!
5	Their manager Paula is excellent at customer service. We bought a table and when it was delivered, there was a crack in the top. She cheerfully replaced the table with another one we picked out. All delivery charge were covered.
