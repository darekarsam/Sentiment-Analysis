5	Highly recommend.  Excellent selection, great prices and Amir was professional, friendly and very helpful.  We are new to the area and went to several rugs store  where the staff barely looked up when we needed help.  Very glad we ended up at the Carpet & Rug Superstore!
5	I was in twice before I purchased my rug and Amir was very friendly and patient both times.  He was helpful but not at all pushy; he let us browse and offered suggestions when asked.  He gave me great information about not only the rug I wanted to buy, but also about other types of rugs as well.  I got a terrific rug and pad at a great price.  I highly recommend shopping here.
5	Very happy with the quality and price of the carpet we purchased from Amir.  His customer service is excellent.  The installers were on time and did a very good job as well.  Highly recommend and would purchase from Amir again.
5	For carpet that we had selected that was also available at one of the old-line carpet stores Amir at C&RSS did an excellent job being responsive to our preferences in a particular way that the other store wasn't willing to do.  The price was better as well.  We're very pleased with the rug we bought and will likely buy another rug from C&RSS in the spring that will complement the one we just bought.
