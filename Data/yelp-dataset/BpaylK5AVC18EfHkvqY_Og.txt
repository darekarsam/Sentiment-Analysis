4	fast. everything you've come to expect from the place..nice people and the food is always hot.
3	The food is great, because it is a Chick Fil A of course. However, the service at this location is lacking. We always come here when visiting my brother because there aren't too many of these suckers up north. This location CONSTANTLY forgets menu items, or you find they've screwed up what you ask for upon arriving home. We make a point to pull into a parking spot, and check that the salad actually has grilled and not fried chicken, or that there's not a random piece of cheese on our chicken sandwich (um gross)! When you call to complain, they really don't care. They forgot my brother's fries once, and they rudely asked what they wanted him to do about it. Let's start with your job!
