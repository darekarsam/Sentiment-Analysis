4	It has been a long time since I've gotten a haircut which I'm still happy with a week later.  I have curly hair and only straighten it once in a blue moon, which means that if my cut is not just right, I find myself with a mop of unruly hair which refuses to be styled.This branch of Charlie Miller opened up about a month ago and has a 25% off deal for November.  I am forever looking for a bargain so decided to take advantage of this offer.  I booked an appointment with Lisa who is in the second to the top tier of hairdressers.  When I walked in I was immediately impressed with the decor and staff.  There were no teenagers running around with ridiculous makeup and haircuts which are really only ok if you are on a runway.  The staff gave off a polished and professional feel which I'm not entirely used to.  Lisa was lovely.  She was good to chat with, expressed an understanding of curls and offered to take the time to straighten my hair for me which was great as I was headed out that evening.  Once it was dry and straight she continued to snip here and there to make sure the cut was even and not too choppy.  Essentially, she took the extra care I'm used to with my hairdresser in my home town who has been cutting my hair for over ten years. My happiness with the cut was cemented when I styled it a few days later and it came out perfectly.  It has looked consistently good every time I've worn it down since, which has been brilliant as I was starting to worry that my hair was just beyond hope.I highly recommend this Charlie Miller and will definitely be going back to see Lisa.
