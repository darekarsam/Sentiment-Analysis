5	Every time i go to Montreal, I make sure to check out at least one Habs games. This happens to be my favourite place. They have awesome  deals on beer during the game, and an awesome little cheese platter. I know...it when your walk in, it doesn't  look like the place you would normally order a cheese platter....but damn! That thing was delicious!
