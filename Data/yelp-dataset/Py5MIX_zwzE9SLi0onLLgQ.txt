5	If you're looking for your next sugar high, this is the place to go!I walked into this store for the first time today and I swear Angels in the heavens started to sing. lol Yes, I have a bit of a sweet tooth. ;-)They have candy that'll take you right back to your childhood, and plenty of new treats to test out as well. The prices are very reasonable, and will definitely make you come back for more.To top it off they also sell ice cream, drinks, smoothies and milkshakes! *drool*Even thought I had a good time browsing the shop, I can't visit very often. Don't think my waistline would appreciate it. lol
