3	Me confused? I don't even know the name of this coffee place inside Marche Atwater.All I saw the sacks and sacks of coffee beans and the coffee roaster at the front of the store.. and my Yelp friend said Coffee.. I know I want coffee.Espresso has this nice kick... that's really jump started me.... the frothy cappuccino just not doing anything to me...Seating is a little tight... but it is quite cozy...really cozy....You can also buy coffee beans by bulk at Brulerie aux quatre vents... oh where am I?
5	I had a terrific double espresso here.  They roast their beans right at the front of the shop, and there are sacks and buckets of beans being processed right in front of your eyes.  Every so often, the machine will make all sorts of beeping noises accompanied by blinking lights, making it seem like it is excited about heating coffee beans.When I order coffee at a counter, I always ask where the beans come from - the owner told me their espressos are a blend of beans from central America - I've always preferred central American coffee to south American coffee, so that was kind of nice to hear.  Grab an almond croissant from Boulangerie Premiere Moisson in the marketplace but come here for the espresso.  It is a great combination.
4	This place is tiny and cluttered and conveniently located in the atwater market. However the coffee beans are always fresh and not badly priced either. now if only they had certified organic beans, then there would be a fifth star.
