3	Hey, it is a convenience store.
3	Cleaner and nicer than most circle k's, but they don't honor the posted price for refills...even when I brought it to their attention, and the clerk watched me walk in with my empty cup.
5	The best circle k I've been in. Cleanest too. No straws,  lids and soda all over the place like most. Everyone is friendly and helpful.
