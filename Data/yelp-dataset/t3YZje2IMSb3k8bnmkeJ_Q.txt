5	Great place for a haircut.  Real barbers for men and stylists for the women.
5	Great place - Tracy is the Best!!!
5	Best haircut in Glendale-- I have been to other barbers as well.  Johnny B's know how to give you a good head/neck massage, steam shave and taper- these are long lost art forms that are traditional to the art but relaxing and helps stress.  This also shows you that they have quality and know how to take their time.  It's not a farmed out process, where they "churn and burn" customers- each haircut I have gotten there is a quality job. Ask for Mike, he is my favorite barber over there.
5	Went to visit Mike at Johnny B's about a month ago. I had been contemplating a quick clean up at Great Clips but decided to look for a higher quality alternative. Loved my experience at Johnny B's, and have been really happy with the haircut for 5 weeks now!
5	Galina is the best. Would follow her anywhere. She always cuts the men in my lifestyle hair exactly how they wanted it. If i ever decide to do the short styles she would be the only one to touch my hair.  The building is clean. Has a garage handout feel.
1	Be sure to make an appointment before going in. Im not sure how to do so though, as they dont seem to answer the phone. Oh well, I will be taking my business elsewhere.
