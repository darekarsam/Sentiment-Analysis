3	The atmosphere is very relaxed and puts you in the right mood.  The staff care about helping you relax, which may sound normal but from what I have experienced some therapists can be very awkward.  They have great first time offers, but the regular rates are a bit pricey considering all of the options in the Ballantyne area.  I recommend checking this place out and if you have a great massage sign up for the membership to get a better rate.
5	I like this place because even though they are a part of a bigger company their therapist are not like those places. They seem happy and are actually nice. I have been to places where the poor therapist is about to fall sleep or they are just exhausted and grumpy.I have been going here for a while and I like the way they treat me. A few minor mishaps with the appointments but it was nothing to make me upset.In general I like them and do recommend them for other people.
