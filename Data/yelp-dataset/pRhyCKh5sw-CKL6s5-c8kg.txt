5	I came to this location because I needed to get a wiring harness installed in my vehicle. They informed me also that my trailer was sitting to low. I had just purchased the hitch attachment at another uhaul location. They were very nice. I would definitely recommend this location.
5	I recently went to this location because it was recommended to me from another uhaul store..  Very rarely does someone impress you as much as Mike Johns did while doing some installation lighting work on my car.  I recommend him highly to anyone wanting quality work done on their vehicle.  He was professional, helpful and knowledgeable.
1	I rented a one way from Las Vegas to NYC.  This truck was not serviced and had very little oil in it.  I had to cross two mountain ranges which included the Rockies.  The engine almost blew up.  When the oil light came on, fortunately I was near a truck stop and I was able to get someone to check the oil for me.  I had to buy four quarts of oil to put in the truck.  Also, when I tried to call the N Rancho location, I was disconnected twice and transferred to another location once.  No one wanted to answer the question if the truck had been serviced.  I finally was able to speak with a representative from the regional customer service who told me not to worry about the light because it just needed routine maintenance.  Unreal.  Also, the truck needed shocks.  The "smooth ride" was a joke.  I felt every bump.
