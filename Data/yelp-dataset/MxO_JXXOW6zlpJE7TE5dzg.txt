5	Fantastic new store. Really different t shirts and other stuff. I loved the light up motion T's. They have the Fox shirts too. It is worth looking into this store.
5	Discovered this fun little store today while going to Sweet Addiction next door. They sell t-shirts, posters, toys and gag gifts, kind of like Spencer's or Stupiodic, but at much reasonable prices. The lady at the register was nice and told me about a sale they were having on zombie items to go along with the return of the Walking Dead tonight. I look forward to stopping by in the future to see what new stuff they have!
4	I love this little novelty shop.  I made my little yorkie Sammie a personalize collar.  So cute.  Everything is very reasonably priced and they have some funny t-shirts, for those with a sense of humor lol.  Come check this place out.  it is quite cool. Happy yelping xoxoxo
4	Great little store! Drove right past it and the name intrigued me, I was curious to see what it was all about.It reminded me of a tamed version of Spencers. I absolutely loved all of the witty magnets they had so I purchased some for my fridge. To sum it all up, they have posters, lava lamps, jewelry, toys, clothes, and a variety of other items which were all very reasonably priced. Pretty nifty store you should check out.
