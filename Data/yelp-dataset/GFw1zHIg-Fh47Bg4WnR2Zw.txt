4	This store is a little weird like one reviewer mentioned.  It is frequented a lot by the students who attend the nearby Moon Valley High School. However, once they start loitering around too much and in large numbers the owner of the store will tell them to take a hike.They have check cashing services.  Money orders ( When its working ).  This is basically a ghetto Circle K with-out the Circle K sign ( Used to be a Circle K though ).I like this store because I can cash my checks there especially when the recession kicked my butt and I lost my checking account.  The check cashing fees are slightly lower than the competition but thankfully I am back on my feet with a checking account.A&S Cactus Express I'm a fan and you should be too if you live in the area and a need a check cashed !
1	They continue to sell "spice" or synthetic marijuana, despite efforts by the police to crack down. They change the chemicals slightly to make it "legal" to sell to high school kids AND adults who struggle with addictions.  Even though they could do the right thing and stop selling, they continue. Please boycott all stores that sell this dangerous substance.
4	Hey for a small mom& pop convenience mart, this place has stuck it out over the years. Nice personable guys, always a pleasure to stop by for cigs etc.Price is right and they hardly ever run out of stuff. It's convenient for me on the way to work etc. and they open early and stay open till late.Hope they stick around for a long time. Thx, Happy Holidays guys!
