5	Dwayne cleaned our carpets and tile today and did an exceptional job. The customer service was fantastic and the price was good. His equipment is top notch and our floors look great! We've already set an appointment to get the rest of our rooms cleaned. Smells like a new home!!!
5	Ames came promptly and provided the best carpet cleaning this house has ever seen!  DeWayne was totally professional and extremely reasonable. If you are looking for professional and reasonable cleaning look no further then Ames!
5	This is an outstanding company!  My carpets and tile have never looked better, thanks to Dwaine and Jared.  They are true professionals, experts in their services, do a fabulous job,and all at a very reasonable cost.  I highly recommend them, and would give Ames Carpet and Tile Cleaning more than 5 stars if it were possible.
