5	I have been getting my haircut here from the Owner of Texture on Bell rd. her name is Vonnie with a V if you go in there please say that joke to her. I have never had a problem getting in and she does a great job
5	Great clean salon! Even kid friendly! Miranda is the bomb at nails/nail art!
5	Being relatively new to the city and to the US, I did not know where to go for a haircut. I have very! long beautiful hair and was a bit cautious about going to a different stylist, but i want to thank Rita for her professionalism, advise, sense of humour and friendliness she is the person that can make your hair look adorable...no , not not adorable stunningly gorgeous! SUPERB! its a shame that 5 is the maximum rating. I give it all 10!
