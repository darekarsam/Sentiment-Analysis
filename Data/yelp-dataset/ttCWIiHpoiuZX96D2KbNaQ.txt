2	This wasn't great and wasn't horrible, either.  It's a definite two star, if only because they acknowledge the existence of the con that I was going to and had a few specials.The food is honestly way too greasy for me.  The flavors were all there and blossoming in my mouth, but at the same time, I felt as though I could feel the grease being painted onto my arteries.If you're looking for something quick and cheap, come to Steel City Diner, but make sure that you're prepared to feel gross for about an hour or two afterwards.
4	Great place for a quick cheap breakfast. We were in town from Jersey for a baseball game last weekend and as close to a Jersey diner I've seen in the Midwest. The waitresses were all business so be ready to order. Our whole party left full and pleasantly plump.
3	This is a greasy spoon type of diner but located in downtown Pittsburgh so it isn't 24-hour. The food is generally okay -- try the French toast or one of the omelettes -- but service can be very slow when the place is busy.
