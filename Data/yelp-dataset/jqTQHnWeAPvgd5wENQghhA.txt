1	I never thought I'd see the day when Walgreens became classier than CVS. This place used to develop photos, now it doesn't. It's just like every other stupid, gross, overpriced and useless CVS in the Valley. Employees are rude or just plain stupid and it's in a terrible area of town, so I won't be going here or any other CVS for that matter.
4	Very friendly staff and have some of the cheapest liquor prices in the area. Drive thru pharmacy is located around the back and is always quick. There are two red box machines located to the right of the entrance.  This location is not 24 hours and no longer sells tobacco, hence the 4 star review.
