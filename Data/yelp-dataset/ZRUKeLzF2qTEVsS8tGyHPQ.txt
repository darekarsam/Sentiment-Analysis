4	A friend brought me here for breakfast as it was my last day in beautiful Montreal. Once I figured out the street naming Ouest/Est convention I finally found it! We were greeted and seated pretty immediately but it seemed to be pretty busy inside. Since this was the morning after lots of drinks, I wasn't TOO hungry so my friend and I shared an omelet. He also let me try his orange juice which was amazing and fresh squeezed. Errr, I stuck with water though, you know, being the morning after and all.I cannot remember the name of the omelet we got but it was REALLY good, stuffed with sausage and veggies, it was big enough to share. Also on the side were a few pieces of fruit and some roasted potatoes which were also REALLY good!Lastly, I love the name of it, very cute!
2	Perhaps we had unrealistic expectations for this place, having gone to L'Avenue the day before, but boy was it bad. Service beyond slow, despite the place being only half full, latte so bad as to be un drinkable . I actually sent it back, twice and told them to forget it. Pancakes were meh, poached eggs rubbery, need I say more? When we got the check, they made a big deal of saying they didn't charge me for the latte I couldn't drink!!! Should hope not....won't be back.
