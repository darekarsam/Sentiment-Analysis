5	We had to use a large machine for our comforters and found this laundry matt. When we walked in we were looking at one of the larger machines, which cost more, thinking we needed it. The attendant came up and helped us right away. He showed us we could use a smaller one ad save two dollars. We left while the comforters were washing and when we can back the attendant had put our comforters in the dryer and started them for us! Such a nice and helpful man! Great place!
5	This laundromat rates five stars as it is spotless, air conditioned, 3 flat screens, and freindly employees
4	3 different size washers 2 - 4 dollars a load. Bill to bill machine. Change machine. Places to fold your clothes. Plenty of rolling baskets to put stuff in. Lots of seating. Coke machine. Televisions located throughout. They even have comfy padded chairs. Pretty clean for a laundromat. Bathrooms located onsite. The only thing keeping it from five stars is that there is no way to get cash if you don't have some already. Also, there are not that many wall outlets for charging your phone, or whatever it is that you need one for. I suppose it is a lot cheaper than laundromats I have been to in the past. If needed, I wouldn't mind having to come here again. It is without a doubt the nicest laundromat I have ever been to.
