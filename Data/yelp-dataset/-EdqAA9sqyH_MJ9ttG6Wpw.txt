5	Thrilled with Charlie's help at Dee Gainey's Body Shop. Had my car bumper replaced and painted in 24 hours. Also washed the outside and vacuumed the inside!
5	I've been here for two different repairs and they are amazing! Charlie is so kind and the shop really cares for your car. I'd recommend this shop to anyone!
5	Old school in the best sense of the word!  Superior quality, great service, friendly team. Cash only means cost stays low.  My car hasn't been that clean in a long time ;). And I wasn't expecting them to detail it.  Great to know there are still businesses like this around!
5	I recently had my car repaired here. The service was exceptional. They didn't nickel and dime like other shops in the area. I would highly recommend using the shop for any body work.
5	I got into an accident which was not my fault. The other party recommended this place. I got a good rental car, quick and painless insurance process. I was on my way to go. Easy to call and access. Good job. I'm satisfied. I didn't pay anything.
