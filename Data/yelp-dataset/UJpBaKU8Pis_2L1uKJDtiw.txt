4	Stikes is a convenient drive right down the street from the job. I've always felt that convenience is well worth paying the extra buck and when convenience is accompanied by good prices and a smile, I'd buy that for an extra dollar.Fast, friendly and family owned. Can't beat that.
1	when i called them and asked for the rate they mentioned it as 1.95 but they charged me 4.50 for each shirt,which is so ridiculous..and the lady over the counter is not even answering my question which is so irritaing..
5	I've been coming here for over 4 years now. They aren't the fastest or the cheapest. But they are THE highest quality cleaner I've ever found anywhere. In 4 years, not a single problem ever. And they are the nicest people to boot. Really incredible pride in their work. I'll be going here for years to come.
