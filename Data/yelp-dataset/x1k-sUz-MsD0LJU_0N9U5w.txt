5	I've lived here and I visit annually. I always stop in to Silver Kivas when in Scottsdale. Beautiful selection of handmade jewelry, many local artisans. Of all the stores in Lld Town, this has the best selection, prices and quality. Highly recommend this establishment if you are looking for excellent quality!!
1	If I could give zero stars, I would.  The shop owner accused my mother of buying the ring somewhere else when she tried to exchange it.  She wore the ring one time and it broke and the store owner Nasir refused to replace the ring without charging her to do so.  When I went to pick it up, I argued that there should not be a charge and he said where is her receipt she could have purchased it somewhere else.  I told him that I would bring the receipt back and if he would return it which of course he would not.  Do not purchase anything from this dispiccable man.  He called me ugly and said that I am wearing black like his asshole.  What a sicko!!!
1	Gets a one star because there is not a lower option.  Wife stopped to look at earrings and was ready to purchase before noting one had a chip.  Said we would walk around and think about it.  After leaving owner came across the street and belittle us.  The most rude shop owner I have ever run across.  New definition of customer service. Buyer beware
5	I've been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. In fact, I've always left very pleased with the costumer service, quality of my jewelry, and the fair prices! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
