5	After doing a lot of research into which TV installation company to use, I decided to call Making TV Easy.  Most other companies had zero review, so it wasn't a hard choice.Rick and David just finished installing my new Sharp 80" TV at my high rise apartment.  I was nervous at first because they would have to make holes in the wall, but they did an amazing job and everything looked great!Even without the 1 year guarantee they offer on their work, I would have highly recommend them. :-)
5	After reading the good reviews I decided to call this company and I am very please to say that they did an awesome work. They know exactly what they're doing and did a very clean job. Not to mention they are honest and reliable. We need more company like them who doesn't charge an arm and a leg. Reasonable price. More power to your company guys. I highly recommend this company and will be telling my friends and co-workers.Ester
5	Rick and David did a fantastic job hooking up a surround sound system for my garage where I host the boxing PPVs. They checked with me to see what time I was best available for them to come over. They also did a great job installing security cams at my home. I'm happy to recommend them because of their professional and efficient work.
5	Came on time as planned.  Walked through the entire process for me and finished within and hour.  They hung my 55" LED and soundbar.  Very professional and safe.  I would not hire anyone else.  True professionals.
5	Rick and His partner did a really good job installing my Samsung 75 inch T.V, and Mounting my Bose Speakers on the ceiling. All the wires is hidden... Highly recommended them installing your Home Theater and surround sound system....
