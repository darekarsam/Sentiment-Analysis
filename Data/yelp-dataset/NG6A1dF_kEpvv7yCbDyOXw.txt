2	Did the easter brunch there.  Service was slow.  Food not good enough to visit again.
2	Stayed at Holiday Inn in Madison West as we visited friends for the weekend. Upon arrival to the hotel, wanted to grab a bite to eat so decided to try out George's Chop house. I ordered a Porter house and my wife ordered the shrimp and scallop with red sauce. The steak was just ok. I thought it was under seasoned. Nothing to be wowed about. The shrimp and scallop was actually pretty good. Over all experience was ok. But would probably not go back there again.
5	Had a great dinner with the wife and kids after some fun in the waterpark.George's is attached to the Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites and we decided to eat there as we were staying at the hotel for a little R&R with the kids.Both entrees were very good (I had the Salmon and she had the portobella stuffed ravioli) but the real kicker is that Kid's eat free and they treat them right!  great kid's menu, their entrees came out FAST and included apple sauce and an ice cream bar for dessert.  Slick as Mud. Loved it!
