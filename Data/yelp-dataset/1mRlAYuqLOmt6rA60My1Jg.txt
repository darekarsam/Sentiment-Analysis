5	I had a massage yesterday.  It was probably one of the best I have EVER had. Sierra was intuitive and found all the many knots in my body. Her touch was the perfect blend of firm and healing.  I will definitely go back.
5	Love this spa and the gentle soul that runs it. A perfectly relaxing massage in a clean and restful location. An almost hidden gem.
5	I purchased a Groupon for an 80-minute massage with warm foot wrap, back exfoliation and hot stones on the back.  Sierra was very friendly and had great technique.  Everything from the Groupon was covered and she focused on the areas I asked her to.  The spa itself was clean and quiet.  It was a great experience and I will definitely go back in the future if I want a massage.
5	My mother and I visited the spa yesterday for a massage, facial and a wax service.  The environment was very clean, well kept and relaxing. We were offered a beverage before our services, in between and after. I felt very accommodated during my time in the spa and extremely rejuvenated following my services. Suzanne and Heather are amazing in regards to their specific services and their hospitality/service. I recommend this spa for every day maintenance services as well as treat packages and special occasions. We were very satisfied.
