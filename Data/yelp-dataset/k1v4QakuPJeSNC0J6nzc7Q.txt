4	I've been looking for a smokin' hot birthday dress for my 21st celebration and hadn't had much luck. After being totally unsuccessful in Saks Off 5th, me and my friend wandered in here. I am SO glad we did. I found not only the perfect dress, but the perfect shoes as well. All for around $100. The ladies that worked there were super sweet and took care of us. I'd definitely go back here to get a cute outfit in the future!
1	I went to this store to buy my future wife a gift and a black girl with blonde hair made it very difficult. At first she was kind of helpful but kept offering her size instead. When I clarified I wasn't interested she began to be condescending to me and other customers. I don't appreciate people like this and left. I'll stick to jewelry.
