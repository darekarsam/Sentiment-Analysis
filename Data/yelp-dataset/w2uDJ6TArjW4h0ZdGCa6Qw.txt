2	Receipt printers fail to work at most pumps, and the lady inside was too busy texting someone on her phone to realize I was standing in front of her.  Can't help but wonder if their losses to theft are any higher because of her.

2	I give two stars because I usually use this location to get water before a hike. Yesterday I come in to get water and the cashier is talking with her manager about something and making me wait for like 5 minutes. Cashier acknowledged me no hi how are you and no smile. Staff needs to be trained and store needs a cleaning. Will I come back.....maybe
