5	Cute little sandwich place in Old Montreal.  The green pea soup was delicious (the best I've ever had) and my panini sandwich with pesto, mozzarella and tomato was very flavourful.  You can get a 1/2 sandwich with soup for $8.  Everything seems house made as well.  The staff were very sweet and I got to practise my French.

4	I had a wonderful little lunch here the other day...perhaps the meal was enhanced by the company I was with and the news I received?  Nevertheless, I like this place a lot.First off the ambiance is reminiscent of a cafe in France (minus the outdoor seating), very european and an intimate setting.  This place will seat no more than 20 people, and that is on the high end.  Secondly, the menu is full of great sandwiches, salads and pastas.  I specifically started with the carrot soup, it was very tasty and very homemade.  Accompanying the soup are some slices of baguette.  I then had a sandwich, the Terra, which consisted of eggplant, egg, avocado, cheese, lettuce, and tomato on a nice panini styled sandwich.  Each sandwich comes with a carrot salad, with a balsamic vinaigrette.In the end it was about $12.  Highly recommended!
4	Great place for lunch. Small Italian cafe serving sandwiches / soup / salads and pasta's in Old Montreal. Service is super friendly & portions are generous. Sandwiches are tasty and the salads are huge and filling. The pasta here is great. Al dente and really tasty sauce. My only complaint is they don't have any meat pasta's. Also the place is super small. They hardly have 7 tables. So it gets crowded during lunch. Cards acceptedFood : GoodService :FastAmbiance : CasualWorth the price : Yes
