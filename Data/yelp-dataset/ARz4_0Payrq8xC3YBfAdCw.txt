5	I needed a nice manicure after a bad day and they were nice to take me at 7:30 even though I called to find they closes at 7. I got a gel manicure and it was done with great precision and care. They made sure I got everything I wanted. Very satisfied and I will be back for more manicures!
5	Very professional; great ambiance. The best pedis in town!
3	I would say this place is pretty much like every other nail salon in Charlotte.  The fumes greet you at the door, they have you pick your color, they point to the chair they want you to sit in, they stare at you and smile, attempting to connect with the few English words they know, they do a decent job and slap you with a bill.  Sound familiar?  That was my experience.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't amazing, it was just....familiar.  They did have a very nice selection of colors which was nice but nothing else stood out to me.  They were friendly enough and priced the same as everyone else.  They did a nice job on my cuticles which other places have not been as detailed.  I would come back.
