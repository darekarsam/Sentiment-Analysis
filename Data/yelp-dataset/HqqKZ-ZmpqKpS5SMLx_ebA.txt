2	This is reportedly the oldest sauna in Montreal...guess what...it is. It looks old, frozen in the 40's . The staff is rude, the crowd is made up with closeted guys from eastern Europe and Arabs who exchange massages among themselves...and now and then a horny older guy who comes here because doesn't know about other saunas or because he's simply used to come to this place. It's far away from any Metro station so you'll have to take a bus or walk to get here, and the neighborhood looks really run down. Don't bother...This place is good only if you are into closeted grandpas, old fat Russians, or old, fat and closeted Jewish guys from Outremont and the Mile-End....Meh
5	I went there last Saturday, the staff are friendly, the terrace is perfect. The customers have a high level of education, completely different from the others saunas. Very discrete private parking. Nice place to meet some bears too.
5	Everytime I go there is awesome! Everybody enjoying the hot sauna :) Good staff too.
