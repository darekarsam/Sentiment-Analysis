3	Great location...or maybe dangerous because it's directly across the street from SouthPark Mall. Convenient drive up ATM, but when are they not?
4	There is a larger and shinier BoA down the street a bit from this one. Is BoA going for the Starbucks business model? Anyways usually I like them big and shiny, but in this case I prefer this BoA.Why you ask? Well this one has a much easier exit and entrance, is less crowded, and the walk up ATM doesn't leave me standing outside. Instead you're in a nice comfy air conditioned little glass cube. If you've never stood outside waiting on someone at the ATM in the hot humid summers or cold wind chills then you probably wouldn't appreciate this. If you're claustrophobic I can see how you'd prefer the other one though, or if you're a huge fan of pink glass and need to check out your reflection for a quick freshen up. Don't lie you know you've done it before!Comforts like this make this my BoA of choice for when I need to do something that I can't do on my phone.
5	Great bank, friendly people and there's never a wait!
