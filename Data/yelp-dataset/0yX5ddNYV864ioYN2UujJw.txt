4	This branch just opened recently within the past month or so. Whether you call ahead or pick up pizza on the go, the people that work here are very friendly and quick! They are very good about greeting you when you come in, and not just one person, everyone that works there greets you. The set up is very straight forward and the setting is very clean and organized. Whenever I can't think of food to bring home, this is always an easy back up plan. I know it seems silly to have to cook your own pizza, but trust me, the directions are so clear, it's very difficult to mess up, and you don't have to worry about your pizza becoming soggy when you drive it home. The pizza comes perfect out of the oven when you cook it at home and looks restaurant quality and tastes fresh and great as well!
5	We ordered the barbecue pizza tonight. It tasted fantastic!! The young men working there are always friendly and professional.  It's also a very well kept business. We will be returning!!
5	I love the whole fact that I can create my own pizza with whatever toppings I want while also being able to choose the different types of crust. If I'm not in the mood to create my own my go to items are the Artichoke Chicken Thin Crust or the Stuffed 5-Meat! Both of them I enjoy thoroughly. And then to top it off they have delicious desert pizzas. I love the Cinnamon Wheel but they also have a S'mores one too and Cheesey Bread. The staff at this store is very friendly and treat you with the best customer service, even opening the door for you when your hands are full carrying out the handmade deliciousness. The other part I love about Papa Murphy's is that it is also baked to perfection! Only because you get to take it home and bake it yourself! Lol.
5	I love Papa Murphy's. Their thin crust pizza is delicious. I love that you can create whatever pizza you want with their varied ingredients. It is also inexpensive. It's the best option for pizza in Anthem as far as I'm concerned.
