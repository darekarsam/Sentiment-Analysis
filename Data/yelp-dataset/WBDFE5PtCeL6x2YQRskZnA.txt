4	It had been several year since I have had PH Pizza. Especially IN an actual restaranut. The pizza was hot and fresh. We had a 3 cheese white pizza and an everything pizza. The alfrado on the white was too much for me. The everything pizza was good. Seemed better then I remember PH to be. The server was really cool. She joked and had fun with us. The prices were good. We had a coupon and she gave us a discount for a birthday that we were celebrating. Yeaaaa for me.
3	The pizza was good can't complain of anything we ordered. But it felt like we were in a refrigerator. I know it's Phoenix and it's hot but today's it's only 84 and I've worked in a pizzeria before but everyone in the restaurant was shivering. We just wanted to eat so fast and get out we didn't enjoy our meal.
4	Fast service! The order was made correctly and was delicious. Friendly staff. We had an order of 3 large pizzas and they were all good. Much better than other experiences I've had with Pizza Hut!
