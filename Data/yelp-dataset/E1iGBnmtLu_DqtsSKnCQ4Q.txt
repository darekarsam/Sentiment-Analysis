3	Small bar but cozy. All high top tables and TV screens available but not everywhere in your face.I had a pretty phenomenal burger and my significant others fish fry wasn't bad. You wouldn't have to twist my arm to get me back here. (I got the black and blue burger with fried onions. Very tasty and the bun was perfect. I'm big on good bread with my burgers and this was fabulous.)
5	Great service, all the bartenders are very friendly. Nice beer selection. Amazing Friday night fish fry. Love their black &  blue burger. A local business managed by local people.
3	Really good burgers. Fun bloody mary bar. If you like to ride bikes to a bar that's out in the country, but not too far out, this is a great choice. Also good for autumn rides out to watch a Packer game.
