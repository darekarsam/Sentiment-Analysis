5	Dave took the time to sit down with me last week. He shared so much helpful information. He definitely knows Realty in the Scottsdale market and beyond. He is personable, easy to talk to, knowledgeable and responsible. I am so happy to be working with him. I highly recommend Dave.
5	If you're looking for a Real Estate agent who you can count on Dave's your man.  He's knowledgeable, honest, and VERY patient.  Buying a home can be stressful. Having someone who's truly in your corner watching out for your best interests is really important.  Dave's that someone.
5	Dave helped us sell two homes, and purchase one too!  He is very professional, and at the same time, attentive to the needs of his clients.  He was there for us 24/7.  Anytime we had questions, concerns, or just needed advice, we knew we could count on him.  We will use Dave for all of our future housing needs.
5	I first met Dave in December/January when I began to think about buying home.  He responded right away to my email inquiry on Trulia and was professional and knowledgeable throughout my whole experience.  I was very nervous to buy a home and Dave walked me through the entire process.  I fully committed to buying a home this past spring.  Dave helped me find my perfect home in the area I wanted to be in.  Not only did he help me find my home, he helped me adjust the pool timer, the hot water heater, etc!  He truly cares for his clients and is so willing to go above and beyond!  Even now that I'm settled in, he still checks in to see how I am doing.  I am so happy I got to work with such a great realtor!  He made my entire process smooth and simple!
