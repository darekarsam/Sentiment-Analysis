4	I consider Kilborne Park my home disc golf course since it is closest to my house and it was where I first started chucking frisbees.It is a fantastic beginner course for those that want to play the standard tees.  The Charlotte Disc Golf Club and the Parks and Recreation Commision have done a lot to this park and course over the last couple of years that have made it more open and family friendly.With only two par fours on the scorecard according to the CDGC, it is a relatively short course with not too many crazy elevation changes.  You can easily just go out and play the whole thing as a par three.The addition of tee boxes farther back and, at times, hidden additional baskets makes the Skillborne course a bit of a challenge.  The difficulty of playing Skillborne has also increased since upon arriving to a few of the goals, there have been either no chains or only just the basket pole.The course is laden with poison ivy, so either keep it on the fairway, or take some sort of protection along with you.
4	I've been playing this disc golf course for years. It's got a few challenging holes. Overall, it's a great course that intertwines with the walking trails throughout the park. Being located just off Central & Kilborne, it's convenient. And for those not as familiar with disc golf, it's FREE!
