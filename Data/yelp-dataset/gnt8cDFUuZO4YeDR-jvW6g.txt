3	I love an all day breakfast, so Benny's was a wee treat for me!  They also provide sandwiches, baguettes, hot rolls and some cakes, but it's more of a greasy spoon than anything else.  Although in saying that, they're sandwiches contain exactly what they say they do - ham, egg, potato scone; no cheeky mayo to unhealthify them!  It's nice inside, clean and modern, although the front outside could do with a lick of paint.  The only thing that puzzles me about this place is their inexplicable love of tuna?  The sign outside raves about it and even sports a picture of a fish with the caption 'this is a tuna'?!  This doesn't do much for me as I hate tuna!However, tuna aside, Benny's is nice for a sandwich or the occasional cooked breakfast, just don't mention disdain for the aforementioned fish - you might get flung to the kerb!But odd
3	My immediate reaction when walking into Benny's was something along the lines of 'this isnt half bad'. From the outside you would be forgiven for thinking this place looked a bit tired and worn, so less likely to do 'good' food - but dont let the apperances fool you, the food here is indeed better than the paint job. Benny's does sandwiches and the like, but deep down I think it really wants to be a greasy spoon - it certainly has the menu for it - all day fried food and various other artery clogging goodness. The quality of the food isnt great, but it does what it says on the tin as it were.The staff are friendly, although only if you atch them on certain days - otherwise they might be a bit rude.
