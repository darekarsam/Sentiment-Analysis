1	The staff at the store is very friendly but they are severely understaffed. I was second in line and it has been an hour. AT&T should really pay attention to this, the have been the customers that walked out thus far. Not sure what that is worth but lost customers are hard to replace.
4	3rd time I've been here & the staff is awesome. They are understaffed but gosh, their service makes up for it! first was to port over my info from my iPhone to my Android. And again this week from my old HTC to my new one. The staff has been great and so so helpful. And they are awesome about making great suggestions, upgrades, downgrades, accessories. Glad they are local. Amber is awesome & will surely ask for her next time again.
