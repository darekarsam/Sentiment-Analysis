5	Always fast & friendly! Their customer service is top-notch and they get you in and out in a heartbeat. I've gone a few times on my lunchbreaks from work and have received nothing short of awesome service each time. Their tellers are always helpful, happy, and even crack a joke or two time and again. Thank you for the great service, BBVA Compass! Keep up the awesome work!
1	Absolutely no customer service! Four people standing around and only one teller. Manager needs some training
2	This is s great representation of a bank that has little care for the customer experience.  I tried out this bank thinking I would move from the big four.  It was not a score.  I was unable to reach phone customer service after holding for a hour.  I was unable to access my savings account at the arm.  Check prices were outrageous.  No personal bankers at this location when I was there to close my accounts.  They didn't even ask me why I was closing my accounts.   Terrible bank, subpar company.
1	This place has REALLY gone downhill since my very first visit. The ONLY thing that keeps me returning is the fact it's the only branch of my bank that's somewhat close to where I work. The customer service here needs a lot of improvement, as does the speed of their service. It takes FOREVER to be acknowledged, let alone waited on, for one thing. Last time I came here to deposit my paycheck, I was spoken to in a very rude manner by the male teller in the drive-up. I didn't appreciate that or the fact that I sat in the drive-up for 20 MINUTES before anyone even noticed I was there and waiting! The other gripe is the fact that a car pulled up in the lane beside mine & was served right away. Then someone else pulled up in the ATM lane & I overheard a teller shooting the bull with the customer...all this while I was on my lunchbreak, having to hurry to get back to work, & having to wait!
