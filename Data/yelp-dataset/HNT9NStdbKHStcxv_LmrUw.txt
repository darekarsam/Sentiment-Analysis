1	If you are in the mood to go somewhere that is full of smoke, dingy, stinky, and full of rift raft then this is the place to go! I have heard so much good from other locals that Dottys is a cool place to go, cheap drinks, and smokes and a cool lounge with slots. I must have been to the wrong one because the lounge was terrible and they really need to update there fan system in here. I'm a smoker and couldn't even stand the smell and overwhelming stench of smoke. Yeah that bad. Yes the prices of drinks and smokes were cheap and there are gaming machines in there but they are crap games and the service is terrible. I will never step foot in a Dottys again and my visit to this one that lasted no more than 15 min was enough for me to never go back.
5	Dude is full of it.  Dotty's is awesome, Its a great place for a FEMALE to play.  I Believe the last reviewer was a HATER.  This particular location isn't the Nicest, but as a whole, DOTTY's is AWESOME
1	I am standing outside of Dotty ' s on Tropicana and Jones located in the CVS. The employee who is working there right now just mowed down a pedestrian with his car. He took off went around the building and the snuck into Dotty 's with no regard to the pedestrian on the ground. There are 3 eye witnesses. While waited for ambulance and police to arrive he comes out and says he didn't hit anyone, then when we show him the damage to his car he claimed the pedestrian jumped onto his car. I find this totally unacceptable. We went in and asked for corporate ' s number and he refused to give it to us. Guess I will continue to tell all my Facebook friends take his picture and post a danger to others notice all while he collect his paycheck from Dotty's. Nice company no one I know will ever go to your locations again.
