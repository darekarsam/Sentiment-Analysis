5	Being a woman, I don't know anything about car. I got fool by some mechanics who recently performed on my old car.  Therefore; I have learned from my past experiences.  I have made many calls from place to place to have my car window tint. Finally I decided to have Scott did on my car, because he explained to me about his work and the types of film that he would use on my car very well. He provided me with an honest answer. Scott did a great job on my car and I love it so much. I would highly recommend anybody who wants to have his or her car window tint by him, because he make sure his customers walk away with a smile on their faces. Thank you Scott, you are truly a wonderful person. Not many people now a day have that type of quality. All they care is MONEY MONEY and NO moral value. Once again, thank you and I m so happy that I chose YOU

5	Scott is very professional and does an outstanding job! I highly highly recommend his window tinting service. He is honest, knowledgeable and very skilled. Scott has been tinting windows for a very long time and only uses high grade film. A Speedy Tint has the best price for the best quality. I am extremely happy with their services and will only use them for my future window tinting.
