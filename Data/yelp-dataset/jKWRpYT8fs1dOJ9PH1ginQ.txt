5	This was the first time getting my eyebrows done at Nordstrom's Studio and it certainly won't be the last!  Sarah did an amazing job for me!  I have never been more satisfied!  It was her first day back from having her precious son and she did not disappoint!  Excellent work & great customer service!  Though it was a bit pricier than what I've normally paid for an eyebrow wax, the quality was worth every penny!
5	YES! I finally found the one! :) my eyebrows where horrendous and I was scared to get them done anywhere because I had a horrible experience at European wax center previously. I decided to try out Anastasia because a few of the girls I work with at my salon in scottsdale recommended it. I ended up just waking in and getting booked with Samuel. He is amazing!  My brows look better then they ever have before! I found my guy for sure! Go check him out!! :)
5	expensive, but awesome! never realized the true potential of my eyebrows. They are artists.
