3	This UPS store shares its main entrance with the Caribou Coffee. They are a full service mailing shop, with boxes, packing materials and yes, they ship stuff by UPS. I think they also have a mailbox system, but I wasn't really paying attention. I just wanted to drop off my pre-paid package and be on my way. The clerk was friendly and helpful and got it done pronto. If I have more UPS mailing requirements, I'll be back.
5	I'm often at this location to ship packages since its close to where i live and I prefer it. Typically i think that USPS is probably cheaper, but i tend to use this UPS store's services over competitors. it is full service and I've never had any issues here. The staff is super friendly and always helpful and it's never as crowded as the post offices on Park Road or South Blvd. I'm always in and out in 5 minutes. Definitely worthwhile to come here.
4	I had a prepaid package that I wanted to drop off, and it was taken care of extremely quickly! I barely had to wait in line and the package was even missing some tape, which the employee said they would take care of for me. Friendly and prompt service!
5	Very efficient store
