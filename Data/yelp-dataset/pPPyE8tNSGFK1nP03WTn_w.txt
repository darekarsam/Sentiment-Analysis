2	2.5 starsThe fam was in the mood for some brick oven pizza and while I id'd some potential winners downtown, we wanted to stick to somewhere close, so off to the Brixx chain we went. We had the wild mushroom pizza, jerk chicken and vegetable pizzas, and the fire pita with hummus starter. The pita was pretty good I thought, the hummus forgettable. The mushroom and jerk chicken pizza were both sans red sauce, and the mushrooms with arugula are always a nice pairing, but I wasn't a fan of the jerk chicken pizza. The veggie pizza was also just pretty average. The dough was  not bad, still a little left to chew on with the thin crust, but I think they overdid it on the cheese, and it wasn't great cheese at that.I was tempted to order the tiramisu simply because they said it was made fresh every day, and I am a fan of home-made tiramisu. Sadly, it scored a huge thumbs down, it had none of the fresh airy just-whipped today texture, it was heavy on the rum, disgustingly heavy on the sugar, and the four of us together could not muster up the wits to eat it all. It was a tiramisu gone wrong, a thick, unappealing glob of sickly sweet cream and to top of, a squirting of what I suspect was hershey's chocolate syrup on the plate, and bad chocolate shavings on top. Oh the shame.So to summarize, I am still on the quest to find decent pizza in Charlotte and I will not be back here to satisfy the craving.
5	Vegan and want pizza? Go to Brixx! They offer vegan cheese on any menu item as well as whole wheat crust on their pizzas. My pizza also tasted delicious.
