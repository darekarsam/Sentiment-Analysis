1	Complalnt: Scam pricing, Inconsistent pricing between store and website, not so knowledgeable staffI have been looking for an in helmet blue tooth headset mostly for listening to music and being able to ask for directions without having to mount the phone and push buttons while I am riding. I had spoken to somebody there a couple of months ago and told that this unit, the HBC100 would do the job.I bought it yesterday because it was on sale. I got home and was surprised that it had been mislabeled and it was actually a dual headset system. I also found out that it was a system that had apparently been used as there was no manual or the tool that is supposed to be included and the operating modules had a full charge on them.I also found out that this model had been discontinued and Cycle Gear had it "marked down" to the retail price everywhere else. This unit was priced the same as the more recent version, the HBC100 PLUS, on their website but the manager wanted to charge me more for the exchange because the store prices are different that their website.I was also informed that to get the VOX technology to operate my phone totally hands free I would have to upgrade to a unit almost three times as much.Very shoddy sales practices left me feeling like I could not trust them to take care of my business so I took my refund and left.
