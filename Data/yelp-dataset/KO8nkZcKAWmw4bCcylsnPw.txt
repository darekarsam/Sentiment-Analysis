4	If your looking for something fresh - a salad, sandwich or a good soup, IO Deli has it.  Small sliver of a store that is take-out or you can stand.  There were four soups where you help yourself, or order a sandwich or salad.  Had a cup of the Tomato bisque soup.  IO makes some great soups and I was not disappointed.  The Portabella Panini with fresh spinach, caramelized onion, roasted peppers and munster cheese was delightful.  Had a side order of kale slaw that was very taste, it had a sharp taste that is perfect for a slaw.  Currently the hours are Monday thru Saturday 11 am to 5 pm.  They have applied for a liquor license to sell beer but as usual with government, the application is taking time.
