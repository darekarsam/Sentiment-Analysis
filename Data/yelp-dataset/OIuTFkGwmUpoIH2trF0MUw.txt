4	This place is close to work so is super convenient. They have fast and friendly service, I specially like the guys and Henna, she is great! I usually come here during my lunch hour, they do both my pedicure and manicure at the same time so I can be done faster. The place is clean and specious, never a long wait and they have plenty of parking space. The do a good job at a decent price. My manicure, pedicure and eyebrows came out to be around $50. I only had one issue when one of the girls did a bad job on my eyebrow wax, she took a little to much off and had me looking unbalanced for a few weeks. I am more specific with them and that seems to help. If you can try to ask for Henna, she does a great job with waxing.
4	My go-to place to get my pedicure and eyebrow wax.  Nothing fancy, they just do a good job and are very consistent!
3	Over all decent. Water for the pedi was not hot but like warm and after a ten minute wait for the lady to get started it was cold. I was not impressed with the polish selection or how rushed the experience was. When I think nail spa I think it is to relax.
5	We came in on a Saturday for a pre-wedding treat. The staff was nothing but friendly. We held conversations easily and had a really relaxing experience. There were four of us getting mani-pedis and two of us also got out eyebrows done. Overall a wonderful experience. Clean shop, friendly people, relaxed atmosphere. I wouldn't ask for anything else. We used groupons, which they didn't have a problem with, but groupon takes a huge overhead profit from their already discounted prices so they told us that next time, we should just ask for he coupon price and eliminate the middle man. For the quality service And friendly people that were there, I wouldn't mind even paying full price lol.
