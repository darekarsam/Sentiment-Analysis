5	GREAT Portuguese eatery and take-away. While it does not come anywhere near the greatness of Romados' grilled chicken out in the Plateau, Casa Manolo does just fine, thank you.Excellent sangria, the grilled squid, sardines, chicken and sausage are done very well also. I have not tried their steaks or lamb chops here yet, but I'm guessing they're probably just as good as everything else.One thing you absolutely have to try here is their dessert. The chocolate mousse is probably one of the richest, most decadent versions I tried anywhere and their chocolate and passion fruit dessert has to be tried to be believed.Service can be spotty at times since they also have a brisk take-out counter business too but the waitresses and waiters I've had here in the past are always polite and mean well.
