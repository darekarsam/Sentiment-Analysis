5	Trattoria Trestevere is by far one of the best Italian restaurants in Montreal located conveniently downtown.My family has been going here for years. It is our go to for a celebratory meal. The salads and minestrone are delicious, as are all of the pasta dishes and desserts (tiramisu and tartufo). I highly recommend it!!
4	This is a great family restaurant - a little quiet sanity in the craziness of Crescent St. in Montreal.  This place really feels like a legit small family Italian place.  I kept it simple - an antipasti plate and pasta with marinara sauce, plus a glass of House red wine.The antipasti plate was exactly what I expected.  Very good.  The fresh tomato was *really* good.  Just a bite, but now in August, it was everything a good tomato should be, and did not taste like an industrial product (sad joke, given just how bad grocery store tomatoes in the U.S. are these days).  The mozzarella went with it very well.The bread was a bit of a disappointment - it would have been great to have some really fresh bread, but it was okay.The pasta and sauce was just fine, with fresh grated parmigiana cheese and fresh cracked pepper on top.  Just the way I like it.   I go for the simple straight forward dishes.  If they can get these right, then the more complex stuff is usually good as well.  Again, the sauce was great, and the pasta was cooked just right.So I would suggest this place if you are looking for a good place in Montreal with that family-run Italian feeling.BTW, I looked at the selection of wines and it looked great.
5	Traditional italian restaurant in the heart of downtown!
4	Love this little Italian restaurant! After walking the city all day we were tired and starving. The comfy, home-style Italian food from this place was just what we needed! The waiter said that they stay open for as long as people come in, so it's a great place for a late night bite!
