5	Came in on a lazy Sunday. Very slow day, but they work fast and efficiently. Took my nephew to get a cut and he requested a faux hawk. And the woman that did it(forgot her name, sorry! :[   ) and she did a great job. He looked so handsome. The salon is definitely kept clean which is also a plus. And the ladies that were working were very sweet. Will be back for sure.
5	Today I went to Super Cuts and had my hair cut by Sandy, I usually don't write reviews, but after spending time in her chair today and leaving with my hair looking great, I want others to know about her, she is good at her job and is a kind easy going person. I will be returning for my next hair cut, of course with Sandy.
2	Not happy.Last 3 visits to different locations very poor results. Seem to always have new inexperienced staff who do not listen to, do not know how to, or don't card about cutting the way the customer likes.After last visit to this location a regional manager promised to make it right by sending me a coupon for future cut at another better salon they own, but I never did receive it.I recommend that guys go to a good experienced barber or if using a hair cut chain, go to one w better training or more experienced staff.
5	Sandy the best !! Really knows her stuff very good personality to boot. She just really makes you feel like she cares about her customer and really help me with a couple tips about the local area
