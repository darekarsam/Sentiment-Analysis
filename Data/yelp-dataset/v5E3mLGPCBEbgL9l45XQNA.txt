2	One of my friends decided that for her 21st we would all go get our nails done here. Great for little Miss Daddy's girl, not so great for the rest of us poor students. I almost jumped out my chair when she told me it was 40 quid. 40 pounds to PAINT MY NAILS!! Which will probably just chip off in a day or two (which it did). Granted there are some nice colours to choose from and the staff are well trained and professional, but for 40 pounds I could buy a lot more than pink nails.I feel like this Nail Bar was an after thought when designing the Harvey Nichols as it is randomly squeezed in at the bottom of an escalator. Which means you get random folk glaring at you as they rise above you. Very odd. For someone who loves to get their nails done there is probably not many places better than Nails Inc. I'm sure if I was a trillionare I would spend my days lunching and getting manis/pedis as all the kept woman who frequent this nail bar do. But for now I will stick to my 2.95 Barry M nail polish and a DIY job.
