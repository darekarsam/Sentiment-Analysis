4	My favorite airline to fly by far.
5	I love Virgin. The people are helpful and I rarely have issues or long delays.Upgrade to Main cabin select for pretty cheap when checking into your flight. The seats get on the plane first, extra 6" of leg room, free movies, free on demand tv, free booze, free food (everything free is unlimited) and one free pair of headphones. Plus you don't have to pay to check a bag so you're already saving $25. Definitely worth it. If I could afford to fly first class I would because I know they get delicious food and service (got to fly up there once).
5	the only way to fly domestic unless they don't go there then just settle at that point.
1	This airline sucks! I booked travel in September and paid main cabin select.  They changed planes so my seats where changed. This is not the first time it happen years ago on Virgin Atlantic. I called them on it today as I went to log in and it nothing but lip service.  Total crap and now to move up they want even more money.  After this trip no more.   I have better service from Southwest then these guys.
4	Nice Flight, but sucks you have to pay $25 for a checked bag. Attendants are nice, seats are comfortable, and they have plugs in between seats. Also they have fun games and movies.
5	I just llove Virgin America airlines. I like assign seating. Its not ghetto and their airlines always looks very clean. the flight attendants always service you with a smile. Book main cabin select and drink all the alcohol you want. get your own t.v. can't really ask for much more from an airline.
