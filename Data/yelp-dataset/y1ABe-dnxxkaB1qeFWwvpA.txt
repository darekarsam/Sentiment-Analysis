3	Like Fiona H. said Khorwa finally brought something different to this street- and by different I mean a clothe store that wasn't second hand. The dresses and tops are quite cute and summery most of lesser known labels. However, this shop always seems to be uncomfortably empty. I hardly ever see customers here which is surprising as it's convenient location you would think it would be heaving. It's prices are reasonable and great if you can't be bothered to trek down to Princess street. Sizes on the other hand are a bit limited and a lot of the clothes require hand wash and no tumble dry- meaning you will probably hardly ever wash them.
4	This store, primarily a dress-shop, on Clerk Street is an absolute gem, and I do hope they'll be able to move to a nicer location where they can get more exposure! The shop is spread across two rooms, and though there are some tops and sweaters to be bought, Khorwa mostly sells beautiful dresses. The last time I was there, I really liked their lacey and chiffon-like dresses. They also seem to be into florals, which I'm not the biggest fan of, but one thing the dresses do all have in common is that they're quite young in design, so you won't find too many long, mature styles in there.
