3	I got quite excited at the prospect of shopping at Farmfoods, because I assumed a lot of their produce would be fresh and wholesome as the name suggests! I was disappointed to find out that they actually specialize in frozen foods. Fast forward to a year later; having moved out of university accommodation where all the cooking was done for me, I've definitely warmed to the idea.I got a little catalogue in the post (spam, basically) about all their products, and realized just how cheap they are! The store is located in Newington, particularly convenient for all students that live in and around the area. Apart from typical fresh grocery items (eggs, milk etc) they selk frozen meat, seafood, chicken, and snack foods, at pretty cheap prices as well.

However, on the other side of town is this absolute gem. OK, if you're a bit of a snob you might want to go in under the cover of darkness. It's not the nicest shop. And if you're into your organic, fresh produce look elsewhere. But if you're a student on a budget Farmfoods, particularly this one so close to uni, is a Godsend. For frozen fish and meat it's absolutely brilliant. You can probably cut your weekly food bill down by almost half by shopping here. The quality isn't the best, but when you're poor that doesn't really matter. Great budget shop.
