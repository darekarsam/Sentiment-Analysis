1	Went into the Downtown Campus bookstore today, and I was appalled at the lack of respect I received from not only an employee but the manager as well. I went in to return a book, and the receipt was with my mom in California. It was a cheap book, so not a big deal if it wasn't possible. The manager was incredibly rude and felt the need to yell the bookstore policy to me in front of everyone in the store. In fact, the older lady in front of me was able to return her book without a receipt and nothing was said--I watched this happen, so I assumed not having a receipt wasn't a big deal. I usually spend about $800 here each semester, but I will now be taking my money elsewhere where I am treated with more respect.
