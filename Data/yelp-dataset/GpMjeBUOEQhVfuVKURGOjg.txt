4	I have been using this physician's office for about a year. I prefer Dr. Kerry Green. The 5-minute quick care for established patients has saved my life!
1	They didn't help me with anything and I went on 4 different occasions and still have the problem thanks for nothing
5	We finally changed our entire family over to Skyline.  The front staff is great and always professional.  I've never had to wait for my appointments, they always call us back within 5 minutes of our appointed time (I've been 8 times now!).  Dr. Kerry Green is great, but so are the PA's.  They listen, which is son nice at a medical office.  I don't like condescending medical professionals.  They have a great benefit for established patients where you can come in for a quick visit before 8:00 am and get seen for simple things like an ear ache, sore throat, cough, etc.  I haven't used this yet, but it was one of the reasons for changing.  We're excited to have a place for the entire family.
5	I have been a patient of Dr. Green for 10 years. I absolutely recommend him to anyone. He is very popular doctor so I see him when I absolutely need to otherwise I am seen by his PA'S and they are great!! Everyone is nice, friendly, and caring in the office.
