2	Really good shawarma, Horrible service.
2	I can't explain what draws me to Amir. I have tried several locations and I leave disappointed every time.I ordered the falafel plate and the falafel are cold. The accompanying salad is nothing special. Just some iceberg lettuce and a few tomato slices. The hummus is pretty good but the garlic sauce is nothing like traditional middle eastern garlic sauce but more like a garlic infused mayo. I've decided to stop torturing myself with my bad choice so I'm going to toss it and find another place to have lunch.
