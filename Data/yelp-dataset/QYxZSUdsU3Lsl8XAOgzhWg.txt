3	Great improvement from their old location on 59th Avenue.  This location has a nice outdoor patio with multiple TVs that look out toward the patio.  In fact tonight a group of friends and I took in the NFL Draft from the patio area.  There's a ton of TVs inside as well.  Food is pretty standard sports bar fare with a boatload of pub grub appetizers (including boneless wings).  Pizza is decent, though nothing special.  Servers are very friendly and attentive.  Altogether this location probably seats twice as many as their previous location and feels much more like a sports bar than a hole in the wall pizza joint.  Good comfortable suburban restaurant for an inexpensive lunch or dinner.  And now a great place to watch a game.
3	After changing locations from 59th and Bell Rd, the pizza has gone down in quality.  It's now nothing more special than any other pizza.  The wings are okay, though nothing to yelp about.  The new location seems to be an improvement over the old one seeing as you couldn't see it off of Bell without really having to stop and look.
5	Love the atmosphere here. Great happy hour, and great service! Super chill usually stop by after work with my husband and daughter.
4	Friendly staff and great atmosphere to watch football! You can see TVs from every seat, even out on the patio. Wings were great and pizza was average. They also had a nice selection of tap beers to choose from.
