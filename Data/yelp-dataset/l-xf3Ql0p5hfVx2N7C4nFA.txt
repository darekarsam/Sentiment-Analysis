3	Jos A Bank's is not the best men's store in the area, but from time to I have found some things here that make for nice gifts.  I bought a couple of cashmere blend sweaters that were on sale. While they weren't the best quality in the world, for the price point, they were really not bad. I have found the service in this store to be a little better than I experienced at other locations.
1	Absolutely horrible service. I called ahead to see if we needed an appointment to look at tux rentals and was told to just come in. When we arrived the salesman blatantly ignored us. We approached him, as he was not busy. He told us to go look through their books. 10 minutes later we were still being ignored and the store was not even busy. We had a much better experience at men's warehouse and would recommend you not wasting your time with this store and their rude salesmen.
5	This store was great and Chris hooked me up! He opened the store early just because I was in a bind. Forever grateful. Will be a returning customer!
