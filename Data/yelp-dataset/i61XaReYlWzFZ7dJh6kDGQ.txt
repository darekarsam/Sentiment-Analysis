5	They'll put a smile on your face each visit no matter which location. I don't live in the area but it's worth the commute. Everything is organized, on time, and quick. Everyone is enthusiastic, helpful, & gentle. They help me wake up at every morning appointment :#) Great team Hansen Orthodontics!
5	Everyone in this office is wonderful... Sharon is our favorite... We simply love here... Daisy at the front is always polite and friendly.. Dr. Hansen is very personable and treats us fabulous...
5	Best ortho office around. They are a busy practice but I never wait and they always act like they've known me for years. The staff is amazing and Dr. Hanson is the best.  I've never been to a dr that is so friendly and actually remembers things about each of his patients. Can't wait to bring my kids here as well!
