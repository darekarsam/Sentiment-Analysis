3	It tells you something about the area of town when you have to ask the cashier to unlock the restroom door.  My friends and I were hungry on shop moving day and they chose McDonald's.  We each had Big Macs.   They were not as good as I remembered them.  The meal for three of us was under $10 though including a couple of drinks and some fries.
2	Went through the drive thru  for just dessert and waited 15 minutes. Maybe longer.  the time i went through was at 12:17am in the morning. Usually the service here is pretty quick.
1	This place is crap!  I was told to wait 4 minutes for pumpkin pies to cook, so park in parking lot.  After 10 mins, employee came out and tried to substitute apples pies but I refused.  I went inside after 25 mins and asked about pies, manager went into back and after a couple of mins,  brought the 2 pumpkin pies, plus 2 more "for my trouble".  I complained about the rest of my order being cold now and was told "sorry" by cashier.  I finally left the restaurant exactly 30 mins from the time on the receipt.  When I got home, I discovered that the fries were missing from the happy meal as well as the sweet and sour sauce that I requested plus all the food was cold.
