1	Disappointing visit.  Granted we went at 12 midnight, completely sober, mind you, that shouldnt mean customers of that hour should get jipped.  We ordered a steak quesadilla, 1 hard 1 soft taco, and a 7 layer burrito. All were jipped on fillings! The tacos had maybe a half inch of combined fillings, the 7 layer burrito has definitely shrunk in size and filling is just as poor. The only great thing about it was the nice drive through gal and the plentiful amount of sauces they gave us! love the verde!!
2	Normally, I don't review chain restaurants, but due to the new release of Taco Bell's breakfast, I decided to break with tradition. First, I visited this location around 9am. The customer service was a little lacking...I had to repeat my order three times then was told they were out of eggs...Ugh!I decided to wait for them to make some more (after all, how do you eat a breakfast burrito without eggs??) I was told 10 minutes, which turned out to be more like 30 minutes.  I got one of each of the new items (waffle taco, breakfast burrito, and a crunchwrap).The waffle taco could have been better. I would recommend syrup with it (none provided). The waffle was greasy and soggy. I had high hopes, but they were dashed. Hopefully, they work out the kinks from this one.The burrito was average. No salsa provided which would have gone a long way. I've had much better breakfast burritos. I would even say, I prefer Mc'Donald's to Taco Bell's.The crunch wrap was my favorite. It had a thin layer of hash browns. I got it bacon and it was delicious. This saved my faith in Taco Bell. If you want to try something, this is the one to get.Overall, it was a disappointing visit but the breakfast crunchwrap saved the day.
1	I showed up at the drive up window with no answer: first at the speaker and then at the window and I know they were open. I guess they just don't like customers here.
