5	Moved out to the East Valley and discovered scorpions more than I would like to see.  I called, John showed up, sprayed and educated me.  Priced fairly and very knowledgeable.  For sure to recommend!
5	John was up-front about the work he'd be doing when I called him, then he showed up on time and was super friendly when he did the termite spot treatment for me. I was a little tense and nervous, but he quickly eased my nerves and talked me through what he was doing. I'd recommend him to anyone!
5	John showed up right on time for my appointment and was great to work with. He checked out the house, including the crawl space, thoroughly for termite tubes. He quickly assessed the problem and explained options carefully. John was able to treat right away, and completed the job in the time promised. When he was done, there were no signs of the critters or the trench that he dug for the treatment. It was as if there never had been a problem. The cost was reasonable, and the work guaranteed. If I encounter other pests in the future, I would definitely call John again.
