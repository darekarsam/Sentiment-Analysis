5	I used LTD this past summer since a friend hosted a party at their party location 5C, off of Mill. This location is perfect for any type of event, especially at sunset. The owners and employees were more than helpful and made my event stress free. The equipment was in top condition and the snow cone machine was spotless. I couldn't be happier because of LTD's help I had little stress to be well prepared for hosting a great event. Thank you!
5	I attended a private party at LTD's Studio 5c venue and it was fantastic!  The rooftop venue is across from Sun Devil Stadium and has great views.  This would be the perfect place to host a pre-game party during football season.  Studio 5c is large enough to host a party of 75 people and the company's rentals come at a discounted price.  The venue is a hidden gem in Tempe that would impress guests for any party. I highly recommend hosting a party at Studio 5c or using LTD for party rentals.
5	I hosted a corporate awards dinner at LTD's Studio 5C. Everything was fantastic! They made everything so easy and they were a pleasure to work with. I would highly recommend the rooftop venue and all of their other services. We will definitely be back.
5	I rented tables, chairs, linen and heaters from LTD for a recent event I held.  From the time I called to get my initial quote, to the time the equipment was picked up, I could not have been more impressed with this company.  The delivery drivers were right on time for both the delivery and pickup and even helped me decide the best location to place the heaters to provide the best coverage to my guests.  I would recommend LTD to anyone looking for equipment and I will certainly be using them again!
