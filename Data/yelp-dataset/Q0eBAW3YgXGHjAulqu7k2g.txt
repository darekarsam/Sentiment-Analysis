5	We were looking for an ethnic restaurant in Yelp, and we happened to be around the corner. What a surprise! The place is cozy, you ask for the food at the counter and they bring the food to you. Hubby and I got the "tellers" (plates) with beef and lamb liver. What a presentation! Rice, salad, eggplants, red cabbage, pommegranate seeds, yogur... delicious!!! Kids enjoyed the chicken durum. And the price... very affordable. Do not forget to try the ayran! If you are tired of German food, this is the place to go.
