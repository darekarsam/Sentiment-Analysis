5	Im born and raised in small town Wisconsin and love visiting this little GreenBay Packer bar!If your new to town or even have lived here for a while, make sure to visit the G Bar G in mesa. Just like our little cozy corner bars in Wisconsin!Love G Bar G and..... Go Pack Go!:-)
5	Born n raised in Green Bay.... Not only makes me a Packer fan... But have appreciation for little bars like this...Guess I have to talk to Kim the owner for a job!
5	This truly is the quintessential bar where everyone knows your name. It is NOT just a local dive bar along Main Street. It seems the patrons truly care about one another, like being at a family get together. Packer games are the bomb! The place is jam packed from floor to ceiling. Everyone brings a dish to share, Kim and Jack barbecue out for everyone and you got a party! This is favorite destination for dart players and karaoke singers. I would say, the best in the valley on both counts. If you ever walk through these doors, I guarantee Kim will not forget your name nor your cocktail and you will always be welcome!!
5	I worked here for just over two years and only left because of health reasons.Kim is awesome to work for. She will do anything for her employees and for her customers. She has never met a stranger. She will meet you once and I promise she will know you the next time. G Bar G is one of those good ole Boys kind of place. Wearing a tux come on in, wearings cut offs and t shirt well that's okay too. Come in sit down and make some new friends. If you are a Green Bay Fan and want to watch a game you better get there early because this place rocks.Best little bar in Mesa. Love the bar, love the people.You just gotta try it once.
