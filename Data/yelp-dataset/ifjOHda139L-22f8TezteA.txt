5	Short: Awesome fades, finished off with a classic hot lather and straight edge razor shave.Long: This is a classic New York style barber shop run by a nice Russian man who moved here from New York. He has been cutting hair forever and definitely knows what he is doing. I got another haircut since the last time I saw him and he asked where I went because he knew it was not his work. He is truly a hair artist. I have somewhat of a faux hawk style with a very short high fade (about a 1). The fade is always perfect, not crooked or with any visible lines. He can line up (edge up) with the best of them with the straight razor and gets my sideburns pointed perfectly. He is very quick, but definitely does not sacrifice perfection. I'll keep coming back as long as I work on this side of town!
5	I get my hair cut there every week or 2. Yuri is an outstanding barber. The shop is clean and has a very comfortable feel. I won't go anywhere else as long as I live in the phx area.
5	It's not easy to find a good Barber. Yuri's shop is exactly what you'd expect. A well appointed men's establishment with comfortable chairs, good music and a friendly but not over talkative Barber. The fade was done by hand with few instructions (no. 2 and fade it up), and the top with scissors, finished off with an offer for beard and moustache trim, and a straight razor around all the edges. Long story short, I think I just found my Barber Shop.
5	I've been going to Yuri now for over a year and I don't go anywhere else.
5	I've been coming here since Yura (owner, barber) took over the business.  Great experience and perfect cut every time - would recommend to everybody!!
