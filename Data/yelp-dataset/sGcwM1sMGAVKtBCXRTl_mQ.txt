5	The employees here, well the ones I've encountered with, are friendly and helpful. They have pretty good deals too. Check out their ads! :)
3	Just transfered my rx here so far ok, dont like their phone system though.
1	The clerks saw me waiting on the drive thru but they kept me waiting for 10 minutes before they acknowledge me! There wasn't any other cars before me and I had a bunch behind me. I was late to pick up my son!
