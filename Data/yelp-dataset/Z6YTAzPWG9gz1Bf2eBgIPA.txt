1	I tried this place because it is close to me, what a mistake. Food is bland and gross as well as over priced. Save your money and go to Lil' Cesars.
4	The managers and customer service are the worst. BUT the pizza is delicious!!! I love it and have been coming for years. I wish they would stop raising their prices though. A large used to be $5 now they are $9.
3	We tried Howie's once...we had it delivered when the in-laws were in town.  Everyone thought it was pretty good.  If you're looking for delicious gourmet pizza, this isn't it.  However, if you have a group, want some decent pizza, and don't want to spend a lot of money, I'd recommend giving it a try.
