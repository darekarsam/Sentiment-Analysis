5	Where's My Walk has been wonderful!  I would highly recommend them for all of your pet sitting needs.
5	Having known Christina Eden for more than a year and a half, and experiencing her passion for our 4 legged canine friends, I'm confident in recommending her to take your dogs for their own, "Wheres My Walk". Christina has quickly set herself apart with her love of animals and caring nature of them. Call her today, and let her love on YOUR dogs as if they where her own!
5	Where's My Walk provides outstanding service every time.  Christina Eden has really become a trusted member of the family which is really important for who we let care for our furry children.  Our dog loves her.  All appointments, schedules, and billing have been 100%.  We will continue to use her services for the foreseeable future.  We highly recommend Where's My Walk!!!
