3	We walked by a few times, and last night we felt like trying something asian... so naturally we went in.The place has very nice decor, and the chef was in uniform!!! I thought to myself is this some serious chef? or is he just posing? Hahaha. I won't answer that question but I'm pretty sure you can guess after you read my review...Let me just say, The sushi menu is just insane!!! there are something like 190 varieties of sushi, sashimi, maki and whatnot... seriously it's just plain confusing .I feel like  a lot of the ingredients are repeated, and frankly it takes me too long to choose...We had a few maki rolls, one with eel, one with tuna and crab stick, one with salmon, some veggie tempura, fish grilled with miso sauce, and octopus salad.The octopus salad looked nice but the dressing was lacking, and too much green and not so much meat. The fish was well cooked and flaky, but the miso was a bit salty. It was served with rice, cucumbers, greens, and more salty miso sauce on the side...The sushi rolls were decent, back in the day, spicy mayo was a nice touch but nowadays it's everywhere and used in too many rolls. The eel roll had see weed in it, which was different, except I'm not sure I liked it. All in all, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either...One mistake I made was not ordering the items on the menu that was marked specialty, maybe that would have been different, maybe next time...The menu is so extensive, I'm going to have to come back before I can make up my mind about this place. Some of the stuff looked interesting to try, but sometimes the description looks better than the thing itself, we'll see.
5	Excellent sushi place, the best there is in the neighborhood. The Dragon is amazing and everything is always fresh and tasty. Yes, it can take some time to get your order but that's how you know your food is fresh. I highly recommend this place.
