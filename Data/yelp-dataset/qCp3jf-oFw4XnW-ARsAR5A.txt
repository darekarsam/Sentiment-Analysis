4	I only got ice cream but it is the same quality as other Dairy Queen locations.  This location has burgers, hot dogs, chicken, fries and much much more.$5 lunches are a popular hit.Eat in or take out.  This location has a really nice outdoor seating are too.
1	1st visit chili dogs were good. 2nd visit the ice cream sandwiches had ice crystals in the ice cream. 3rd and last visit the chili dog was not even cooked. They put a cold uncooked hotdog on a bun and poured hot chili over it...yuck!!   Next time,  I will drive to the hotdog restaurant near Tempe Towne Marketplace.

4	Had a $5 lunch box, hit the spot. The help was pleasant and out going. Service time was acceptable and the food was decent. The facility is new and fairly clean for lunch hours. Over all experience was good. Happy to have a DQ in the area.
3	Pretty average for a DQ. Good ice cream. Mediocre food and service.
