1	If you are searching for a Condo, find a Condo.. THESE ARE APARTMENTS!!  Not condos.  The speed bumps are horrible, parking is ridiculous.  And since they are privately owned, ANYONE and I mean ANYONE can move in.  Some of the loudest and rudest people.  And to get Security to get off their lazy bums is not going to happen. Unless they happen to be out on patrol.  Its a gated community yet cars are broken into, or spray painted on.  HOA is of no help either, not to mention if you end up buying be leary.. They allow HUD!  Which brings the property value down on your home.  But alas some of us are stuck here in the POINTS recreation.  Until we can get out of the screw ball of paying mortgage too high for an APARTMENT!  Its just not worth it.
5	Great community.  Been here 2 years now and no problems.  Clean, safe, quiet with a pretty good mix of people here.  Great location near the strip and you get a lot of bang for your buck here.  Secure gated community with 6 swimming pools, 6 tennis courts and 3 fitness centers.  Palm trees everywhere and the community is very well maintained.  Don't let the idiots complaining about speed bumps scare you away.  Come check out Bella Vita and you will be very impressed with it for the prices they are asking.
