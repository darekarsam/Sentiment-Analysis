3	They only get 3 stars because of the cars they sell. The staff there are nice i have nothing to approach about that, but what really bothers me is how the company squeezes you after you purchase the car.  Oil change, wipers, special tires, small aesthetics parts....you really have to put a good 150$ a month on average for maintenance.
5	I had an excellent attention from Vincent Carlini, Conseiller de Service.  His attention was honest and straightforward.  The shop looks spotless.GREAT SERVICE !!!!
1	The service to change tires takes 2 hours and please note that I was first to be served at 8am.One can see thru the glass door how slow the service is. Very slow. I was servicing my previous car at Toyota Spinelli and it was always done within 45 minutes.Of course there was a complimentary car wash, but that is 15-20 minutes.Also, very dirty and wet summer tires were poorly wrapped with parts of tires being exposed resulting with dirt everywhere in my trunk and on the back seats.Perhaps car wash should be done in the beginning and this will give enough time for tires to be more or less dry and clean.And last but not least, I was never told that I will be charged extra $50 for nitrogen. Should be clearly indicated and explained when booking appointment (I did it on internet and I was passing by and confirming personally).I have to say I am quite disappointed with service and overall experience.Not sure if it is common and I am just being spoiled by Spinelli service.
