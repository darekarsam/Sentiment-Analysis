2	Bad, but not the worst.Internet only worked downstairs in the common room.  Room was clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was good and I looked forward to it.  Location is convenient.  Owner is a nice guy.  They will charge you 5% extra if you use a credit card and 1% extra if you use a debit card. Wifi costs 3 L.TV is tiny.  Gets a decent selection of channels.  Free parking in back.
3	My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights though the week which I bought on a deal from Late Rooms. It was really cheap, and the hotel itself is okay.The good: Great location, lovely receptionist, easy check in/out, clean rooms, comfortable bed.The bad: Breakfast, both 'continental' and cooked, consists of cheap stuff - cheap bread, sausages, own brand cereal, cheap orange juice and bad coffee.  The walls are paper thin and you hear everything; the cleaner had a radio blasting through the hallway whilst she cleaned the rooms - annoying. Internet not great.
