3	My biggest gripe is concerning the service they use to make online payments. It is very very frustrating. They use Rent Cafe and it is very limited. The site doesn't post rent & utilities until the 1st of the month (if then), and doesn't show a running ledger so it is next to impossible to know exactly how much we need to pay when trying to pay in advance. Essentially, we are given one day to pay (the first) and half the time when we log in on the 1st the pertinent information isn't available yet. When the current rent is made available, our ability to split payment into multiple payments (like when there are more than one tenants) is disabled. The staff seems nice. The ground are well maintained and the upgrades are great. However the monthly aggregation and stress involved with paying rent is too high.
1	This is a poorly run complex. Things are constantly breaking and going wrong, and the staff is virtually unresponsive.Hot water, AC, and dishwasher have all broken within 6 months, and they took forever to fix. Many other problems they just don't respond to. The AC systems pump musty air into the apartment and it doesn't goes away.
1	This is the worst apartment complex ever! The management here fucking sucks it takes weeks to months for any service you need done in the apartment. I have put it some many complaints about my dishwasher leaking, washer and dryer broken, all the outside walk way lights have been burned out for over 3 weeks and nothing has been done to fix it. I have put in 6 written work orders for my blinds to be fixed and never been done. They bitched me out for having 2 beer cans on my patio from the night before. I wish I never moved in to this terrible managed property
