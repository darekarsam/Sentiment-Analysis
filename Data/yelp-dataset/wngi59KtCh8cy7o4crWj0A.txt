5	Oh Boy!  Do I love BBQ after eating at Spee-D-Tee's Mobile Barbeque!  It's not just mobile food...there is a real restaurant here!  The restaurant is a bit hard to notice because it is on a very busy street.  It  is on the corner of Elwood and 40th Street, north of I-10,  a very busy road!  Plan to make a quick turn into the parking lot just north of Elwood.  You really can't miss seeing the checkerboard racing design on the building but it comes up fast! Anyway, I love the pork sandwich.  The sauce is marvelous.  I like spicy, and it is hits the spot!  There are lots of choices on their menu.  They serve a whole lunch or just a sandwiche.  If you have an office party, think of Speed-D-Tees catering it!I have talked with the owner Barbara many times.  So nice!  She takes the time to make sure you get exactly what you want for your order.Anyway, about the sandwich.  You take 1/2 home, it's so good.  It microwaves up nicely, the bun turns into a sort of dumpling, sitting in the sauce and the meat ...oh, yum!Anyway, check it out.  I would love to see more people enjoying this place!
5	$7.99 for a sandwich, chips & a drink. I had the brisket & it was so so tasty! Can't wait to go back.
5	Still wonderful! :-)  I eat at this BBQ restaurant every time I'm in this area.  Barbara and staff make sure your experience is wonderful and delicious :-)
5	This place is incredible tasty barbecue goodness in a clean place with plenty of seating. I'm definitely coming back. There's no wait! Stopped by little miss bbq for lunch and the line was tooooooo loooong! And the service is so friendly.
2	This is simply horrible barbecue. They actually should not even tell people that they barbecue here because they just cook ribs and things in the oven and give you a whole bunch of sauce to cover it with.I would highly recommend avoiding this place if you're looking for serious BBQ. I have heard that their sandwiches are decent
