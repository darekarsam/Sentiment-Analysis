2	I took my Audi S5 in for wheel spacers. I was quoted a price that I was happy with so went ahead and had them order the parts. A week later they installed them and I am happy with the work, not a hard job though at all. What I am not happy with is that after they were all done they   gave me a bill for $75.00 more than the quote and gave me a BS story about wheel lug nuts or something, which was included in the original quote by the way, and I was supposed to get locking lug nuts, I got none. I was going to have them do a clear bra and a custom installed radar detector ($2,200.00) also but now I will find another company. Not happy with the way they handled the whole deal, I will not go back or recommend them to anyone I know ever. Their customer service is way below avg. IMO
4	Joe, Any luck yet on the locking set of lug nuts for the S5 ?Just checking in....Dave
5	Amazing. Talk to Troy, hes a great guy and super nice. I don t know shit about cars but he took the time to explain everything to me and even show me around the shop and what other projects they were working on there. I ended up getting new rims for my car and the first time the put them on they were slightly too wide so they shipped them out for a slightly less wide pair and had them installed again 2 days later. Had a great experience overall. Will be going back soon for some custom dash work.
5	I had a few dents that I needed to repair on my brand new car and Findlay Customs was right next to my work. I went in and talked to JJ and I can't be happier with this decision. My car looks flawless. JJ was very professional and took great care of me. Picked up my car today and my year is made. You can't even tell that there was body damage. I would strongly recommend this place!!!
