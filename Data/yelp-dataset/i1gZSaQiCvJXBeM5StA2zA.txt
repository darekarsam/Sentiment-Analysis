1	Did Bead Haven really think that moving locations would do anything different for them? It's all about customer service & Bead Haven has one of THE WORST customer service problems. How about this, sell the place & hire an entirely new staff..that MIGHT get a couple previous buyers back. But until then I'm done with this place, they should be out of business!
2	Until reading these reviews, I though that I was the only one treated so rudely. I'm almost glad to know that it's not just me. The first time I went there, I asked for a small bit of help, I'm by no means either needy, nor am I stupid. I managed to flag down a blonde woman who sighed heavily as if it was an imposition for her to stop hanging up beads to stomp over and answer my question. The prices are o.k. but the service is sorely lacking. They need to take customer service classes.
1	I saw that bead haven was no longer @ the w.lake mead location, and thought " wow they closed thier doors, why am I not surprised. I was never so disappointed in a store owner. I really pity her, that she actually believes that this is the way your supposed to treat your customers!  My fellow friends and beaders refer to her as the Wicked Witch of the west. What a reputation to uphold. good luck with that.
