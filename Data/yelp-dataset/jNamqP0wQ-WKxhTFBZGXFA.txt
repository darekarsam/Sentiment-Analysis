3	The restaurant took the place of the Chlorophylle sport clothing store at the corner of the street, and it's visually interesting. Dark/woody ambiance, a nice bar where you can see the chef cooking your food over the stoves...very nice place!The service, while polite and enjoyable, was a bit long. I know they had some problems during the evening (Interac machine not working well, problem with ventilation, etc.). The quality of the food was uneven: my wonton soup was pretty good and had an pleasant spicy taste, yet my beef tartare was OK. The chocolat fondant was just amazing, thougth!Overall, an OK experience: I'll retry it at a later time, just to see if the bad luck of an opening restaurant are all over, and if everything have improve or not...
5	Ever since I became a vegetarian the thing I've missed the most was sweet and sour chicken balls. When I discovered that this restaurant had a sweet and sour battered tofu I was eager to give it a try. The General Tao tofu, and the a l'orange version, are absolutely fantastic; they satisfy the craving completely and are incredibly morish.Back down to Earth for a moment, I've been there five times now and the service and food constancy are extremely INconsistent. The sides seem to change depending on who cooks the food, which feels lazy rather than necessary. Wait times are usually very quick, but I've waited over an hour before, with no apology, explanation, reassurance, or attention (with a fairly empty house.)Overall I still go back once a week, but there is definitely room for improvement.
