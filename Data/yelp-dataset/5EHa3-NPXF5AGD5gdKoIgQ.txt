5	I cannot say enough about Eduardo and this company.  I called them in to tackle the job of my back patio and front yard. They not only were quick, courteous and affordable but they also helped to take care of a nasty weeds. If you need yard work done or amazing work for your home, I would recommend KO's Landscaping. They are a wonderful company and very affordable. Great service and trustworthy!
