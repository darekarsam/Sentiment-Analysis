4	Needed new front shocks for my 06 Silverado. Called Bill a couple weeks back and based on our conversation, recommended the Rancho 9000 adjustable shocks. I rolled in and told him I was ready to buy them. Although Rancho increased the price like 15% over what he quoted me on the phone, he honored the price he gave me on the phone. That is straight up good business!When I asked him about their return policy, he said if the shocks look new and you bring them back in the original box, they will refund your purchase if they do not fit properly.
5	The Boys at Desert Rat are awesome.  I hate car stuff and am always afraid of being taken because I am  a women.   When I went is they asked what the problem was and took care of me without  trying to tell me I needed more than just the shocks.  I felt comfortable with them.  I will send everyone I know.  Thanks guys!!!
