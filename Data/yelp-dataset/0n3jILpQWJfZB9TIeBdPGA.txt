5	Went here because we needed to be able to park in a disabled spot. Huge car park with perfect entrance for disabled people.The staff were very very nice.The buffet was the best Chinese buffet that I've ever had. It was such a wide choice and desert was good I loved their ice cream machine!Great atmosphere and would defiantly go again!
5	Beijing Banquet in Dalkeith is the doyen of all you can eat Chinese Buffets.In the (almost) 2 years I've been coming here it has offered consistently high quality food with very friendly staff.The atmosphere is great, if a tad loud at times.There is a veritable abundance of the most moist and succulent food. Battered Fish, Chinese Roast Pork, the finest Chicken Satay I've yet eaten and simply oodles more.An extensive desserts section including a "Squirly whirly" Ice Cream machine, and (wait for it...) a Chocolate Fountain with Marshmallows only adds to the sheer unadulterated ecstasy one experiences when dining here.There is a large seating area, good drinks selection with Karaoke every night.Cracking value for money too.Thoroughly recommended!
4	On arrival, you are greeted buy a welcoming member of staff. And taken to your seat where your drinks order will be taken. I always op for the water jug. Don't want to fill up on fizzy juice.. True?.There is a wide range of dishes. All delicious to start, but then the wall sets in.. And everything starts to taste the exact same as the plate before?.  Also it could be doing with a little more oomph on the presentation of the dishes. I know it's a buffet.. But doesn't mean it has to look like it?.. Also if you do attend on weekends be prepared to listen to drunken customers howl on the karaoke if there is function booked... Suppose it adds to the comical factor.
