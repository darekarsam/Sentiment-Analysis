5	Great, friendly, super fast customer service & they have a drive-thru! (: I've been to several Wells Fargo locations & this one is by far my favorite. No ridiculous lines and long waits.
5	This is my favorite Wells Fargo location the customer service is excellent the people are friendly and there's a nice atmosphere when you walk in. They greet every person that comes to the door.While standing in line and waiting for my customer representative I noticed that people who had certain issues were greeted by another representative with a  handshake, so very attentive I think it's a nice change.If you bank with Wells Fargo I would definitely make your way down to this location if you're looking for a great customer service!
2	This has to be one of the slowest location I've ever been to. Stood in line for 15-20 minutes and at the window for another 10 minutes. Avoid this place if you have other locations near you.
