5	I recently received my order of business cards and property flyers from Logo Executives and the quality and the attention to detail was superior.  The orders arrived on time and neatly packed.  Very happy with the product and service.  Thank you !!
5	Fast production/shipping and Excellent customer service. Our lapel pins turned out just how we wanted. Adzonwheelz will definitely be using Logo Executives again.
5	I have used a lot of different graphic designers while creating marketing tools and advertisements for my company. John who owns Logo has by far been the most creative designer who's passion for his work has radiated. We are very pleased with his work and the time in which he get's jobs done. If you're looking for a creative designer go to John!
5	Logo Executives is fantastic! I have used a couple other print design companies, and have turned to John for help as the others did a terrible job. John pays attention to detail and makes sure the project is perfect upon completion. I've had business cards, letterhead, and convention booths all printed through John and the process is always painless, quick, and fantastic quality. Highly recommend!
