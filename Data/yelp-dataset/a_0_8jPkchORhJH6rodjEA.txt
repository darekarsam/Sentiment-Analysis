5	Love this nail salon! Unlike others I have been to they talk to you in a friendly manner, they let you pick your pedicure from a list of prices ranging from 20 to 30. You have the option of hot stone foot and leg massage, paraffin dip, and different scrubs. They take their time doing your pedicure. Unlike other places where you wait an eternity and then the service takes 20 minutes. The nail techs in this shop are awesome. Will continue to go back every week.
5	Great nail place! Staff is really friendly, and double checks your satisfaction as they go. Super clean too. I had a special Panther's colors request and they went out of their way to help me pick colors. I had black with silver tip manicure and blue on the underside of the nails for game day. I was really impressed that she didn't have to do much clean up because she was going pretty quick. They are perfect and the price was fantastic. I will be back and recommending them to my friends.
5	I really like this salon! I am always greeted in a friendly manner and offered a service menu. By choosing my own serivice package I am not surprised by the price at the end, I know what to expect and they don't stray from what you want. I have never waitied here either. They have newer pedicure chairs and stations- it is so nice to sit in a pedicure chair that actually works and gives a good massage. The staff hold friendly conversations with you and usually have a news channel on the television. I wish I found this place sooner!
