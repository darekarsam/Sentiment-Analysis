3	A bit too expensive for this lowly pleb but sometimes you just have to go crazy and treat yourself to a Sainsburys 14 inch triple cheese meatfest pizza rather than your ordinary Lidl's option.Beware though, this is the coldest supermarket in Edinburgh, take a coat with you, even in summer!
3	Located in the Moray Park retail park, this is one of the biggest Sainsbury's close to central Edinburgh. I had my hopes up for a great Sainsbury's haven since I really like the Sainsbury's stores in general. Although this is a big store with much more selection than the local stores, the customer experience wasn't warm, friendly, and inviting. The vegetables, meat, and dairy items were easy enough to find but trying to find a lightbulb proved extremely difficult and, after searching the entire store, I finally went to customer service to ask and they showed me how they were located at the end of an aisle by the checkout counters at the far end. Who would have thought they would not actually be in the aisles dealing with home things? The staff weren't particularly friendly and I had hoped for much better from this store.
