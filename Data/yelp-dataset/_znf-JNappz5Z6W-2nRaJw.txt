5	Great shop.  The staff and ownership was very knowledgeable and really helped me to narrow down my search.  I found the pricing to be more than competitive and they had a few items in stock that are nearly impossible to find in town (380 acp and 9mm.)Definitely will work with the DM team again.
5	After a ridiculously horrible experience at another local Gun shop I decided to check out DMPF. I was warmly welcomed and the staff showed genuine interest in answering my questions and taking the time I needed to help make an informed decision with my next firearm..      They are ALL about customer service first. Sales will ALWAYS follow that in any business.It is worth the trip to visit their shop!!
5	These are very knowledgeable great guys here and have very fair prices.  They have a small shop at the SW corner of 7th avenue and Deer Valley and I have now purchased 4 firearms from them.  They are a sig dealer so they had the buy one sig 1911 get a free 1911-22 for free and I took them up on that offer.  There were only a few participating dealers since most gun shops sell sigs are not really direct dealers with them.  They also sell lots of LWRC rifles, AK's. AR's, several hand guns and brands at great prices.  Think they also do trade and will take a check to save you money over the credit card fees.
