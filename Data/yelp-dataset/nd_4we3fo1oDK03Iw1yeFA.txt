5	My son has attended Tree Roots Montessori (TRM) for about 9 months, and my husband and I couldn't be happier with our family's experience there. Our son previously attended a different, high-end childcare center in Tempe, and we see a huge difference the level of personal attention that our son receives at TRM vs. what he received at his previous school. At TRM, our son has the opportunity to engage in a Montessori curriculum while still receiving the type of individualized attention and care that every parent would want for their child. Since coming to TRM, both my husband and I (and my parents, who spend at least one day a week with our son) have observed big improvements in his confidence, independence, and listening skills. We very, very highly recommend TRM to any family looking for a high quality educational and nurturing environment for their child.
5	My daughter attended Tree Roots Montessori and we both had a wonderful experience! Ms. Hulya is an excellent hands on teacher and she provided my daughter with love and support, while at the same time, encouraging her independence. Academically, my daughter left Tree Roots Montessori with a strong foundation in number concepts, phonetics, reasoning ability and daily life skills. These skills have helped her tremendously in kindergarten and first grade. Ms. Hulya's in home classroom is well designed and my daughter really enjoyed the small class size and I was happy that my daughter received so much personal attention.
5	Ms. Hulya is, simply put, an amazing teacher.  Both of my kids got so much from her.  Her kindness, intelligence, and creativity in teaching allows kids to learn and have fun.  The environment is very well-structured, and for those of us looking for a personal and comfortable learning environment, Tree Roots is a great fit.  Talk to Ms. Hulya for a few minutes, and you will realize what a great teacher you have found.
