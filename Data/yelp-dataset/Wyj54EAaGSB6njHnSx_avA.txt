4	It's admirable to see a record shop avoid the mainstream. Underground  Solu'shn prides itself on offering those hidden rarities, hard to find gems and an impressive selection of vinyl.  Ultimately this comes at a price with the average vinyl/ CD costing 12-14 pounds.  Nonetheless, unlike the larger entertainment mega-stores, you can try out your chosen record on any of the available decks: a sort of 'try before you buy' system. If your a budding DJ and your looking to boost your track collection with some rare gems, chances are Solu'shn will stock such items.
