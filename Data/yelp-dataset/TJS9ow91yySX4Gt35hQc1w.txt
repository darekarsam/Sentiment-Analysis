5	This place is really great, and we have been bringing our dog here for a few years now.  The prices are very reasonable, the people are very good, and they are extremely caring to our dog, who is pretty afraid of the whole grooming process.  They usually give her a cute little bandana to wear home, and she always smells wonderful!  You must call ahead, and they usually are booked in advance, so you might have to wait a week or two to get an appointment. While they are normally too busy to answer the phone, they always get back to you.  My husband and I really like all the people here, and we are so glad that we don't have to take her to a chain!
5	This place is fantastic!  Very reasonably priced, they do a wonderful job with my German Shepherd.  Nails, ears, bath, and grooming- she looks like a new woman when they're done with her!
5	I have swtiched from taking my pups to the dog stop to this place. Way better service and the ladies that work there are so friendly!! i also love that you can see your pup when you come in because the kennels are in front...for me its nice to know they arent sitting in a kennel in the back under a dryer or being mis-treated. I have a pug and a toy shih tzu, my previous groomer insisted on cutting my little shih like she was a poodle leaving a lot of hair on top. i was so please when i picked them up after their first appointment and her cut was the perfect length all over and no extra hair on top!! I was expecting to pay extra for my pug because he doesnt like his feet to be fussed with and he only ever goes to the groomers for a bath and a nail clip but the ladies assured me that their dog sling makes it easy and fuss free while protecting my pup.i cant wait to take them back :)
