3	Meh, Pier 1 I can love or hate you, depending on the season (or should I say how you rush the seasons).  It delights me when you are in the summer/push to fall season and you have all the different colors in the store.  But I have to say that I am totally not into you when you start putting out candle holders that are to resemble reindeer.  I try to stay clear of your store when this happens.It's like a higher end tchotchke store.  Sure you could find something of your interest in there, but definitely not an essential that you'll need.
3	Typical Pier 1 location. My only complaint - and this seems to apply chain-wide - is that they NEVER have more than one of the products that we're purchasing. I feel like every piece of furniture that we've purchased has been a floor model. I'm not joking.Regardless, the staff here is very nice.
5	while visiting the burgh i needed to hit up a pier 1 so I checked online and found this gem of a store...at first I thought it was at the pittsburgh mills area....but didn't see it so I called the number and they told me exactly what exit to take to get there which was very helpful...I probably would have gotten lost if they hadn't been so detailed on the phone.I arrived and a worker asked if i needed help and led me exactly to what I came for and this was a large store beautifully laid out and displayed........it helps that fall decor is my favorite....The checkout went smooth and they even emailed my receipt......I only wish I had more time to shop!
