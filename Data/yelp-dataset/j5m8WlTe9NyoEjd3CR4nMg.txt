1	I am appalled that you would publish a customer's phone number and address. This obviously shows your lack of professionalism. You just shot yourself in the foot because no one in their right mind would use your services after you posted a customer's information because you were angry. Wow!
5	Sukie is a life saver. She rescued me 3 days before the wedding. She took in the dress a quarter inch and added buttons to pin up the train! She did an AMAZING job and she had it ready in time for the wedding.
5	I bought my wedding dress from Sukie's Bridal 2 years ago. I would like everyone to know that I had a FABULOUS experience here and I LOVED the employees here! Both Sukie and her husband were so nice and so helpful every step of the way.My dress was absolutely stunning and had a lot of detail to it. Lots of beading on the bottom and lots of pickups in the back. I am 5 feet tall and wanted to wear flats for my big day, so we had to cut off quite a bit. I was worried the detail would be messed with, but she was able to alter it to make it look just incredible! I was SO happy with the outcome!She made the vision of my dream dress come true and it was a completely stress free situation. Thank you Sukie's Bridal!!!
5	I just had my wedding dress altered at Suki's. My dress is a huge ball gown (think Belle from Beauty and the Beast). The dress was a hand me down, but it needed extensive alterations since I am a short person. She took me as a walk in and started pinning the same day. I am pleased with the experience and in how quickly everything was done. Thank you Suki!
5	This is my go to place for alterations. They did an excellent job on hemming my jeans. The lady is always friendly to me every time I go.
