5	Sandra..... and Exile Creative Group, is phenomenal.  She was very helpful in the most stressful situation.  My Gramma had died and I wanted to get a memorial bookmark made for her service.  She was quick and remarkable and was able to design exactly what I had in mind to have a remembrance for years to come.   I recommend Sandra and her company. You will not be disappointed with her creativity   or their custome service.    Thank you Sandra your the best!!  Dawn Houlf- Share Builders Inc/The Force Realty
