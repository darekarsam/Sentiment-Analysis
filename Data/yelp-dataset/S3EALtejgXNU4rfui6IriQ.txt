3	This place is hoppin' at lunch time during the week. If you can make it before noon, you can avoid a long line. I must say the sandwich was good. I got the Baja Chicken, which never disappoints. We just beat the crowd, but after that the crowd was large, the line was long and the A/C wasn't doing much to cool the place down. It was hot and muggy. The iced tea was fresh, which in my book is big. I like fresh brewed tea, but often times find it not fresh. Kudos for that. I'll go back, but it will probably wait until the weather cools, or they start chillin'. I was a little disappointed that an employee was promoting his side business while working in Quizno's attire. Not sure if the manager knew or not. He looked like he might've been trying to do it on the sly. Nice guy, though. Friendly atmosphere and good food. Just too hot without the A/C.
4	I have been to this location a few times since my visit last summer when the AC was on the fritz. As all good Yelpers do, I am updating my review, as the rating for this Quizno's location has changed. I arrived before the typical "lunch hour" and was pleased to find no line. It was prompt, friendly service at it's finest. The Baja Chicken was as good as ever and the AC was chillin'. I got it to go and was very pleased to find it traveled well. As long as the AC is working, this place is hard to beat for a quick tasty sandwich. I will definitely be back.
2	The "hot" sandwich came out just warm(as a result of it being left out after it was toasted) and I feel I got shafted on the portions. There are definitely better options than this.
