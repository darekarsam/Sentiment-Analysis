4	So the restaurant Pied a Terre got revamped in Shez Carl Tapas&Vin.  The interior  design change is drastic, strange geometric shapes, red colours on the walls and cosy tables. The menu of the new restaurant is impressive, long list of tapas and also few main course options. Good list of wines and by glass choices we enjoyed tasting. The famous french onion soup with duck leg comes in cappuccino cup, a little bit salty, but quite tasty. My favourite tapas were the raviolo and onglet chimichuri (amazing hanger steak with spicy sauce). The baby back ribs were so well advertised by our host for being smoked for hours in the kitchen that we had no other option, but to try them. They go very well with these yummy hot patatas bravas. I'm definitely planning another visit because of the ribs.I wish there are wine flights offered with the tapas as to combine diverse wine flavours with the extensive food options. May be Carl Chevalier will read this review and add some wine pairing choices to the beautiful menu.
