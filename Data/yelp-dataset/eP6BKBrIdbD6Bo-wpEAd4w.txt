4	Beautifully staffed with friendly people. Clean & comfortable place to hang. Denise on day shift is the best!
4	Used to be a regular here but as I've moved away it's far less often that I visit. Originally this was a nice quiet (mostly locals) bar with a few pool tables, some great bartenders, and decent gambling. I drove by quite a few times before stopping in on a recommendation and fell in love with the place after my second visit.Over the years the bar has changed to serve a younger crowd (including karaoke on Friday nights), but most of the bartenders are still great and I stop in when I'm on this side of town for good times. I recommend it to anyone looking for a locals bar on the weeknights, or the younger crowd on the weekends.
5	Moved to Vegas about a year ago and this bar was right by my house.  From day one the staff was polite, hilarious, aggressive, and knew how to pour a strong a** drink.  I have been in for every shift and there is something I like about about every bartender.  I would recommend this bar to anyone.  There is a kitchen.  The food is great..try the Gyros.....my fave.
4	A fun sports bar covering all teams with friendly people and hot bartenders.
4	good place to have a beer and play some Keno....
4	I like how  nice and welcoming the bartenders are. The chairs are comfortable and the drinks are good. Also when it's late at night you have to be buzzed into the bar.
5	The only reason I give this place five stars is because of Marc Dillon. He brought me back after I had heard nothing but bad things about this bar. I was down and out and Marc treated me like an old friend that means a whole lot in my book. Vegas has a lot of bartenders but they can't find another one like him. :-D
