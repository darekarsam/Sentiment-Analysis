5	Now we are sooo sorry we bought furniture before finding this place.  Love the furniture, the owners were great and the selection was almost mind boggling!  We honestly just went to look at the southwest art.  We did end up with a great wall hanging, along with a table runner, buffet, end table, coffee table, laptop table and side table!!!  We will be going back next time we need something unique for our home.
5	Family owned, local business??  Westside Furniture is an absolute "no brainer"!!  My furniture was delivered today and completely surpassed any expectations that I had!  Marty was a great sales person, Eddie was awesome, and Jim made my day by calling to deliver my furniture on a Sunday!  This is excellent quality at excellent prices....we will be back!
