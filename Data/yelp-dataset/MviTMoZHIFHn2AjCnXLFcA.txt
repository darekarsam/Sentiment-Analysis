5	I just switched my daughters pediatrician and decided to take her to Matthews Children's clinic.  I picked Dr. Musgrave and honestly because she's about my age. I wanted someone more modern and up to date for my child.  I picked a great Doctor for her, she was very nice and on point with her visit.  She was very thorough and let me know everything I needed to know and do for my child. I was really impressed by everything at this doctors office. She will be going back for many years to come.
1	I needed to schedule and review session after being referred to an outside specialist.  I was told to fax or bring over the paperwork and the doctor would review the information without me and then schedule an appt. This was completely inconvenient to me and my time much less 2 trips to doctor's office which is 40 miles total.  If they are too busy to review information with me and respect my time, I can find another clinic or doctor that is willing to spend time with me and my child.
