5	I'm scared of this place blowing up because it is still below the radar of awesome dumplings in this city but hell, here goes nothing...My boyfriend and I came here last Friday night. We were a whopping 8 people in the restaurant eating (according to the server, he said this was a rush), not counting those that were playing on the lottery terminals. Yes. They have lottery machines. What a bonus to those who enjoy these things. Unfortunately, the vegetarian options weren't huge but I had the cabbage and mushroom dumplings and they were delicious. My boyfriend had the pork and chive dumplings and he kept telling me how much it sucked I didn't eat meat to taste these little dumplings so I assume they were good. We split a seaweed salad also that was really tasty. The best part was the booth we were sitting in, a big U shape that belonged with Grey Goose bottle service. Unfortunately, we don't like Grey Goose (and I doubt they do bottle service, although they are licensed and from what I could tell had all the basics) but the vibe was fun nonetheless. This place competes with Qing Hua Dumpling on ave Lincoln. I recommend it to anyone that loves dumplings or cheesy deserted bars with lottery terminals.
4	This restaurant is also a bar!! They make the BEST spiked iced cappuccino! You can request what and how you want your drink made too! Friendly bar tender. Place is clean and apparently their dumplings are to die for.   I think this place is a hidden gem. Woohoo!
4	This place is a little intimidating to enter as it is quiet, still unknown, but I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the dumplings were. I had pork and chives. Yummy! The owner was extremely pleasant and helpful. I definitely recommend it.
