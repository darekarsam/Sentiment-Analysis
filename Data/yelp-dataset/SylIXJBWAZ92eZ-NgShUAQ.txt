5	Very friendly people!Prices are on each item rather than on shelf which is kinda a throwback - thought they weren't displaying prices at first.
4	Are you kidding me... this is a great little store in downtown Champaign.  Convenient! It's a fully operational battlestar or pharmacy needs with all that you would expect from a corner store.  A lot of folks don't realize whats inside, they think it's just a pharmacy.  It's much more.One star from 5 because they don't have tamales like the shops in my old neighborhood in Chicago... not their fault I know.  It's just me.
5	CompleteCare Pharmacy in Champaign is absolutely the best!  The people are friendly and the service is just excellent.  Like going to the little pharmacy of times past with all the niceties of modern day chain pharmacies.  They even recognize me and remember my name when I come in!  A great inventory and convenient location in downtown Champaign.  If you live in the city and aren't using CompleteCare, you are missing out.
