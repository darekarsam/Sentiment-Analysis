5	I have to say this pharmacy is fantastic. The owners and their employees are extremely professional, friendly and just all around caring. No one there judges you or treats you badly, like the big chain stores. They are quick , efficient and willing to go the extra mile for you. They will actually call and price check for you and order medincines for you. They do this because they want to feel better unlike the huge chains that make you feel that you are inconviniencing them. I have switched to this pharmacy and I'm sticking with them. When I walk in I don't have the shame, worry or fear I had with chains because they do care about you&your health. When you are not feeling well or must take maintenance medicines you don't need someone making you feel worse. This pharmacy, it's pharmacists and employees will leave you with a smile and a knowing that you will get better following your doctors & their advice!! Thank You Phoenix for making my visits awesome!

5	This is the best pharmacy I've ever used. You're in and out in a matter of minutes. And the staff is always very friendly. And Jasmine always has something helpful to say, suggestions that I wouldn't have thought of. Phoenix is the epitome of what a neighborhood pharmacy should be.
5	I've been going here for over half a year. Forget those big chain pharmacies. This place is fast, efficient and friendly. You don't know what you're missing in terms of customer service if you are at a big chain pharmacy. Never had an issue with medication NOT in stock. The people here are friendly and professional.   Scripts are filled in minutes. Do yourself a favor and support this small business!
