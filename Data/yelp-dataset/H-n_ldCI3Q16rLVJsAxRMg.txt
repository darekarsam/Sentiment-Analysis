5	Great find!  It's a new hole-in-the-wall mom & pop noodle shop where the owner, Vid (very friendly guy and great cook), says it's mostly Hong Kong style soup/noodles, but there were other things on the menu.  Very clean with modern decor...both table and counter seating.  5-stars for great food each visit, and very reasonably priced.  One of my new favorite places!
5	Simple menu and good noodles. The pot stickers are fresh grilled on one side. For the price especially  the food is very good.The restaurant is hard to find right now: the temp sign is small. It is behind the chase manhattan and KFC.
3	Good food
5	My new favorite spot for the days I am to busy to cook. I just pick up and go. The short ribs are outstanding. The service is great too.
5	I go here all the time!! Super nice owners! Most importantly the food is AMAZING!!! My favorite is the pot stickers, and the No. 2 spicy noodles with yummy meat! The place is cute and clean. Great service as well!
4	Shoyu ramen is so good. I tried d pot stickers because thats what d others recommended but I wasn't a big fan, thats probably just me though..
5	The noodles are amazing! Great menu, exceptional customer service! So happy to have such a good place near me to grab a quick dinner or lunch!
5	A small place in a hidden corner, the owner is the chef plus waiter. It is simple and fast, the beef noodle tastes good.
