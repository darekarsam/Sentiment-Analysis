4	Why would you rate a Bojangles? Well-I have never had a friendlier staff in one of these types of restaurants. It is fast-food with more than a smile. The service was quick and the order correct!The biscuits are fabulous! Slight spice to the breading on the chicken-not too much. The cole-slaw was good. The mashed potatoes and gravy were okay-I'll go for something else next trip!Clean, fast and cheap if that is what you looking for!

4	I love Bojangles and my husband actually wanted to go, so we made a pit stop before car shopping. It's kind of difficult to see the sign because it's right behind the Wendy's sign, so just be aware that it's there. The only thing I can complain about is the wait time. It was a little slow. But when we were up to the window we saw a guy walking out with 4 of those Big Bo Boxes. Crazy! I think they had to remake all of their food and that's why it was slow. It almost worked in our advantage though, because everything was so fresh! It was great! I only got a plain biscuit, but my husband got a bacon, egg, and cheese and it was so good we almost went back to get another!
1	This has got to be the slowest Bojangles in America!!! The staff sucks, and they always ask you to repeat your order like they cant hear you. If I have to repeat my order to you three friggin times I am fuckin pissed!!!
1	Slowest Bojangles I have ever been to. After several visits for breakfast they continue to be slow.Update 10/16/2014When I got the window the lady was apologetic for the delay and mentioned they were short handed.  She was very pleasant as well.  I was contacted by Bojangles with an offer to "make things right".  I have been back since and the flow of the drive thru was much better.  I will go back because Bojangles biscuits are addicting.
