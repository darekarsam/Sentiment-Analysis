3	I will admit the chipped ham sandwich was good. It was tender and salty and soft on the wheat bread. But this is just a deli. More like a bodega than anything actually. The signage is classic and the neighborhood, especially Ohio Street, is a delight. Isaly's is a Pittsburgh legend, but more sentiment for yesteryear than anything.
2	My friend lives near here so I came to satisfy my deli sandwich craving. The inside is super dingy deli/convenience store, so I was excited for a real, down and dirty deli sandwich. They have a lot of weird items in their grocery section which can be kind of fun to look through.I got an Italian "hoagie" as I feel is the appropriate term for this ultra-Pittsburgh spot. It was bad. Totally skimpy on the meat, and it had American cheese and mayo, which don't go well with Italian meats at all...provolone and oil & vinegar would have made way more sense. The bread was a squishy white bun. I mean, I still ate it, but I didn't really enjoy it. It made me kind of sad. It was just a sad, floppy excuse for a sandwich. At least it was cheap?Maybe I should have gotten the chipped ham instead, since that's what they are famous for. I also suspect the location in the North Hills has to be at least marginally better...this Isaly's is clearly past its prime.
