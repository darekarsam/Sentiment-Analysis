5	I have been going to Casey At The Bat since I was 13 years old.  I am now pushing 30.It has changed an itsy bitsy, but really... it's stayed the same in the last 15 years.  Still the same old ratty nets for the batting cage... still the creaky pitching machines, still the same crappy doors that swing open into the main room with the snack area... But you know what.  It's home... and it's not supposed to be glitzy... It's sports, silly.  You're supposed to get dirty!
1	So i'm going to start out by saying I know we are in a recession and money is tight but this was the worst mini golf course that I have ever seen. I loved that when we walked in all the arcade games were shut off and didn't work....probably because our round of mini golf only costed $12 for the 2 of us. We proceeded to the course which was a total joke. The turf was totally beat up, the staging and props looked condemned, and at one point I smelt something that resembled a dead body or animal. At one point I bet this was a nice place but the ponds that went thru the course were all dried up and not working and everything was a mess! It wasn't enjoyable and we were very disappointed, Spend the extra couple dollars and go to crackerjax or castle n coasters.
5	Great friendly atmosphere . Low price from batting cages to team enter fees.
