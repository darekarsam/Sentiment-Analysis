4	I have lived here for 4 months now and have seen enough to do a review.   I don't really have a down side here, although I think one of the big selling points for me was the covered corner balcony that is about 10 x 10 and somehow they are almost all (if not all)  arranged so that you can't see into another apartment or balcony.   EVERYONE on the staff is friendly and helpful.   The apartment floor plan is two bedroom two bath unit with the bedrooms being on opposite sides of the apartment and good sized.  The guest room has enough room for my queen sized bed dressers and a love seat, the master has a large walk in closet.   It is a quite two story complex, neither myself or my roommates have heard our neighbors ...ever.    The pool closes down at 10 and even then it isn't too loud on the second floor, it was a concern of mine but isn't a problem at all.    Parking is reasonable for an apartment complex, between my roommates and myself we have three cars and only a couple of times have we had to park down the complex a ways, but a spot opened up after a bit and we moved them closer.   The Apartment is behind Fry's grocery store, which would be great if their prices weren't so out of line.  I often say that Fry's "forcibly violates my soul."   There is the Grocery Outlet across the street, Chase Bank near by, Indian food, circle K, Hardware Store, Vietnamese Restaurant (me no rikey), a late stage alcoholics bar called the Hoot Owl, Baskin- Robins,  Padre' Murphy's, 2 Auto Parts stores, a poker club, Papa Johns and more all withing the 4 corners of the intersection and an easy walk (October -May).    Oh... I almost forgot!  A church about 500' up the road with AA meetings so you can walk there from either bar.    Which will come in handy if my heavy drinking ever turns into alcoholism.   I am glad I didn't fall for the dog and pony show of the apartments which shall not be named on the SE corner of the 101 and 17 hwy.
1	Update:   DO NOT MOVE HERE.... DO NOT MOVE HERE....     11/9/20211   The apartment management team sometime in the middle of the night put notices on every door telling us put our fire extinguishers outside our doors by 8 AM or we would  be charged $45 for them to enter the apartment on a later date.   What a complete jackass move!!!   SCAM ALERT....SCAM ALERT    They only seem to care about money and trying to scam those who are not going to stand up for themselves against their bullshit tricks and lies.    CHECK BEFOE YOU MOVE SOMEWHERE AND BE SURE NOT TO RENT FROM ANY PROPERTY RUN BY "GREYSTAR" PROPERTY MANAGEMENT, IF YOU VALUE INTEGRITY AND CUSOTMER SERVICE.         The property management company and staff have all changed.   I get the distinct impression that the current management company had no respect for their customers, the residences.     An example would be the recent notices posted of their legal right to enter your apartment and that they would be entering in the next few days.  They didn't offer any reason why they would be coming into my apartment and on top of that had marked the box indicating that the legal notice had been hand delivered to a resident vs. the box that said it was left on the door and a certified letter had been mailed.  I happened to be awake and the notice was dropped off at 11pm.   Shady people....very shady.   The lack of respect for customers is similar to the experience I had with this property management company at another property. We also suspect that the new Management company has sold our information as we have been recently getting more junk mail from strange sources.   We noticed a lot of the same junk in the garbage can so we are thinking they may have sold everyone out.     I love the apartments, the balconies and layouts but really dislike the staff.     I have nothing but disdain for the management company Greystar.Update:   I have down graded to one stare.   WARNING, DO NOT MOVE HERE....DO NOT MOVE HERE....
1	Cantamar is a roach infested area. I have had roach problems for the entire 6 months that I have lived there. After multiple attempts to reach out to the apartment management for help with this issue, I finallly had to call the city of phoenix to spray the man hole on the other side of the wall from me. I am a VERY clean person. I don't let trash build up. I have a small child at home that puts EVERYTHING in her mouth. I'm scared that one day I will find one around my child or worse, in her mouth! Cantamar is a nasty place to live!
