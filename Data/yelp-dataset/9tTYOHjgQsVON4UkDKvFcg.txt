4	I'm so glad we have a liquor store so close. If not for Darren's eagle eye, I wouldn't have known about it. They have a wide selection, and the people working here are nice. They had exactly what I was looking for.
4	This is a small store. Very small. BUT, it is open later than many of the other liquor stores in the area and so I was able to find what I needed. Even though the staff was ready to close the store when I entered, they were still helpful and didn't prod me or try to push me out at a faster pace than I was moving.They need a bigger store.
