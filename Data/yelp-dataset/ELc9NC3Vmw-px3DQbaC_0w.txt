4	Who doesn't love a deal!  One of the larger ross' in the area and fairly clean with a good selection of clothes.  One thing I did notice is the staff is fairly unapproachable and unfriendly.  I overheard one exchange between two employees which involved profanity... not appropriate at work.  On a positive note, if you're looking for a nice set of clothes that tend to be known designers for a fraction of the cost, then hit this place up!  They don't call it Ross Dress for Less for nuthin!
1	This is about the worst Ross I've been to....and I've been to a LOT of them!  This is probably the largest one in CLT, but their selection is crap.  The front end never seems to be staffed well enough to handle the foot traffic on Saturdays.  Save yourself the effort and find a different location.
3	If I am looking for something specific, and it's a good day, I can find 1-3 dresses!  Otherwise, I don't usually find much in Ross, whether it's a weekday or the weekend.  Typically, there is usually a wait at the register which I find annoying.  This is the closest location for me and I only enter when I am looking for something specific in the dress department.  Shoes are a waste of time, as are the kids clothing.  Most of these items would not stand up to the wear and tear my kids would put them through.
3	Again, this is one of those chains where you can't judge a book by its cover! If you have the time you can find some really great deals here! They have pretty much everything here, clothes, paintings and plenty of home decor. When I visited they were changing over some departments it looks like they are going to have a larger selection of rugs and portraits and paintings which will be great or anyone who is looking to update their home.I enjoyed the visit and would return! Just remember when you go be prepared to search for your good deals!
3	This is the worst Ross in Charlotte! They don't have a maternity section. Attitudes suck. Very unprofessional. No thanks!
