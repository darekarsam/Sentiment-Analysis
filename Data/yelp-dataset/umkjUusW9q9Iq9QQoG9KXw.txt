5	Me and my roommates decided to go to Vegas early yesterday and here we are at the Tempo Bar & Lounge at the Las Vegas Hilton having a few early morning drinkies! I hate writing reviews on my iphone but i just had to mention that i went to the outlets on the south end of Las Vegas and i went to this place called Perfumania, they are SOOO much cheaper than other places like Sephora! I ran out of my favorite perfume PINK SUGAR and before we went out last night, i had to get some more, so we went to this place and i could NOT believe that i normally pay about $45 but at this place they had the EXACT same bottle size of PINK SUGAR for only $36!!! Great deal....anyways, gotta get back to my roommates and have a sip of my bloody mary :)
1	Literally the worst service I have ever had in any store. I can't say anything about the products in the store because me and my friends were thrown out before I could see anything. To top it off I was accused of stealing an Essie nail polish that I did not even steal. The lady started yelling at me telling me to put it back and I didn't know what she was talking about. Then She went on saying she saw me put it in my shopping bag. I told her she could search me but she said,"I'm not gonna search you, but I know you took it." Then she wouldn't leave us be. Then Me and my friends then decided that she was way too much and it wasn't even worth it so we left.
2	Is it really free? I went to the store in Kittery Maine, I've been several times this time I received what I thought to be a free tote bag and a zip lock bag of sample (3). to my surprise when I reviewed my receipt I found they charged me a penny each for the FREE gift. I know your saying it just a penny, correction 2 penny.  remember I did not ask for the tote and I did not ask for the 3 samples they were giving to me. then... they charged me for them.
