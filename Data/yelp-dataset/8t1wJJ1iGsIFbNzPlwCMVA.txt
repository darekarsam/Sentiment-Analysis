4	When I walked in I was greeted promply and asked how I heard about the restaurant. I told her my car was a few doors down getting some maintenance done and I just happened to walk by. The owner told me this place just opened a week ago (04/08/11) The place is well decorated and has a huge TV hanging on one wall, the music is traditional mexican which complements the bright colors and Mexican decor. This is a great place for lunch, late breakfast or dinner, reasonably priced, good food and service with a smile.The hours:Open Monday through Saturday 9am to 9pmLocation:North East corner of Hardy and BroadwayMenu:Burritos $5.49  with choice of tortillas: flour, wheat, tomato basil and choice of Carne Asada (Grilled Steak), Pollo Asado (Grilled Chicken), Barbacoa (Shredded Beef), Adobada (Pulled Pork) and Carnitas (Pork)They have rice, black or brown beans, jack cheese, sour cream, roasted chile corn salsa, romain lettuce and different salsas from mild to spicy.They also offer Tacos with the same meat options for $1.25 each, Taco Salad for $5.99, Quesadillas (open face) for $4.49 with meat for $1 more and Nachos for $5.99
5	BY FAR THE MOST AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD IN TEMPE! YOU MUST GET the soft corn tacos with all the fixings! a fav of mine is the steak quesadilla so delish. -6 choices of meats that will wow your taste buds and make you feel like your in baja (: you will get the best meal under $10
5	The burritos are delicious and very authentic-the owner often works there and will talk with you about how all the food is prepared while allowing you to sample the different ingredients. Very friendly
5	Great chicken burrito. Even though I didn't get the enthusiastic greeting that everybody else received, the guy behind the counter at about 7:30pm did eventually give me some samples of one meat and that jalapeno cream cheese too. The cream cheese and both of the salsa's at the salsa bar were all in the hot category, even the green one that normally is mild. Go for the pico de Gallo if you don't like things too hot like myself. The beef in red sauce also had a hefty kick, but the chicken was composed of huge chunks of white meat that the cook put back on the grill before piling it atop my custom made burrito that was in progress.   These things stand out here:1. Chipotle tortilla (choice of 4 others too)2. Roasted Corn to put inside the burrito3. Homemade Horchata4. Free Homemade Chips with your orderThis guy knows how to roll one too. The ingredients were all super fresh and the burrito was one of the better ones I have come across. It's in a strip mall and it just says Taqueria on the outside, but this is my new go-to fast Mexican place. It will blow away any chain and my total bill was $8.18 for the burro and drink. Thanks to previous Yelpers for uncovering this local gem.
5	This is the BEST Mexican restaurant that I have been to in a long time.  Why haven't we known about this joint before???They have 6 types of meat chicken, carne asado, green chili pork, regular pork, red pork and barbacoa.  You pick your meat. They make their own retried beans!  Take the pintos and mash them.  We had tostadas with the pork and green chili pork they both came with the mashed pintos   Very good.  Got the carne asado quesadilla. It was so good.  Got 3 street tacos and 3 hard tacos.  The tacos are a great deal.  $.99 a piece or the meal with a drink for $3.99.  Salsas are great and the gauc is the real deal.   We will be going back!   So good and fresh!
4	Killer carne asada, good service, salsa bar, what else do you really need? Let's be honest...
5	"The food is fast, delicious and exellent quality. They have crispy tacos! (and I dont mean the nasty deep fried kind) The hot sauces are awsome! This is not your typical authentic mexican food place, it is spotless clean and no mexican crap on the tvs. Trust me, check this place out !!
4	I have been to Sombrero's a couple of times and enjoyed it immensely.  So much so that  I am picking up food to take home for my family today. Their red chile pork is amazing and the chile diablo salsa is so yummy!  The corn shell tacos are my first pick and their jalepeno cream cheese is a nice addition if you MUST have additional dairy (although not typical mexican style to do so).   I would love to try their nachos but can't seem to steer away from the tacos.  Side note - if you can't find their sign, it's under the Taqueria store front! They really do need to get signage out there. I have been to this center many times and until i read YELP I wouldn't have known it was there. Glad I found them. My husband is too!
4	Good tacos and only a buck each!
5	Welp this place trumps most other burrito places by far.  Service was quick and to the point, food was delish and the atmosphere was  just what I would expect from a hole in a wall mexican grille. Totally loved it. Got the red pork and my bro got the carne asada and woofed down. I'll be back for sure!
5	Oh nummy food!
4	The BEST homemade horchata EVER!! You have to try it! Everything here is clearly made with attention to detail. The cuisine is fresh and authentic!! And the prices are unbeatable. I had the carnitas burrito. It was fresh, tasty, and filling. My tummy and tastebuds were definitely satisfied. I would come here regularly if I lived in the area.
5	We were leaving the Angel's Tempe Diablo Stadium and craving some authentic Mexican food. Took a chance with this spot because although it had great ratings on Yelp, there weren't a ton of reviews. Sooooo glad we did!! The food was amazingly delicious and exactly what we were looking for! It's kind of Chipotle style in that they make your food in front of you and ask you what toppings you want as you go down the line. We got carne asada nachos with the works (including guacamole and the jalapeno cream cheese which costs extra but is definitely worth it) and a chicken taco and a regular pork taco. All were fantastic! We'll definitely be coming back to visit when we're back for Spring Training next year!
5	Bomb! Can be compared to Chipotle, simply better and cheaper. Super quick, super fresh ingredients. Really love the red chili pork/beef.
5	Best Mexican food ever. Love this place. Can't wait to go back. Love, love, love it!!
3	Let me preface this review by saying I didn't have any of the meat here. People say the carnitas are amazing. Like most people say, this place can be hard to find--it's on Broadway and Hardy right across the street from the industrial district. It has a yellow sign that says "Taqueria" on it. Why it doesn't say Sombreros, we'll never know. I had a vegetarian burrito which came with corn, rice, black beans (of which you get to choose from two types of bean), lettuce, and some spicy sauce they had. You also get to choose from a chipotle, spinach, flour, or corn tortilla. I had the spinach and it was very tasty. Came with a side of some old, forgettable tortilla chips as well. The total was 6 bucks EXACTLY, which made the OCD part of my brain shiver with delight. You might refer to this place as a cheaper, possibly healthier "Chipotle." The decorations and furnishings inside are nice, modern with a touch of old-world Mexico. The three ladies working behind the counter lend the place a very authentic feel--it's quite obvious these three have made a LOT of tortillas in their lifetimes. Unfortunately it only gets 3 stars. Maybe in South Dakota or Iowa, or any place that doesn't have 3 great Mexican restaurants within spitting distance like Tempe, AZ this restaurant would merit an extra star.
5	Tersoro escondido!Sombrero's Mexican Grill is simply a delicious hole in the wall hidden gem! I had the spicy tacos and frijoles and chips. AMAZEBALLS!
5	Great taco shop! Get the carna asada tacos. Squeeze some limes on them and add some salt to top it off. Perfection!One of the best taquerias ever. All our coworkers can always agree on this place. Price is very reasonable so we always come here for lunch.
5	Went with a couple of my Teammates there. The food was good. They were making the burritos and Quesedillas from semi made ingredients. We can select the meat, beans, other ingredients like corn, sauce, cilantro, sour cream, guacamole, onions. The tortillas had options too - Flour, wheat, Spinach etc. The chips that come with the combo was good enough. The guacamole was fresh and good. The hot sauce was fresh and real hot. The people running were courteous and helpful. All in all this was a great place to have a tasty lunch. Will definitely visit again. Will definitely recommend.
5	Still sat here and just had to write this review. Small, friendly, amazing food. Try it. If you go out to eat for service where you are waited on, try somewhere else, if the reason you go out to eat is to try great food, eat here. Great food. If I lived in the area this would become a regular for me no doubt.
5	Absolutely as good as it gets when it comes to simple Mexican staples such as tacos and burritos, made to perfection.For an average of $7, you can enjoy a build your own burrito, chips, and home-made horchata.  Build with savory selections such as barbacoa, green chile, chicken, or carnitas.  They have all of the fresh ingredients of your choice such as cilantro, roasted corn, pinto and black beans, shredded oaxacan cheese, and pico de gallo. The beauty of this little gem is you are choosing what goes into your dish.  I had the ambrosial barbacoa with pinto beans, a heaping of fresh cilantro, a medium hot salsa, and generous dollops of their signature jalapeno cream cheese.  The savory combined with the salty and spicy, balanced by the fresh and citrus-like flavor of the cilantro made this a phenomenal burrito.On the menu are also fresh soft and crispy tacos, and tostadas.Highly recommended not only for the flavors, but the cleanliness and friendliness of this Taqueria.
1	Not fresh, they reheat meat on the grill. Go to Chipotle.
5	This is our new favorite place!  The ingredients are fresh, the place is clean and the owner and staff are awesome!  Even though they're most known for their meat options, the vegetarian burrito is hands down the best I've ever had!  Try the jalepeno cream cheese too....it's amazing!!
5	This place is amazing. Staff is always nice. Not much more I need to say!
5	We tried this place out just a few days ago. The food was fresh and flavorful, and the service was very friendly. It definitely gives Chipotle a run for its money (and I am a big fan of Chipotle).I got the asada burrito, which also comes with a handful of chips. The man working behind the counter gave me some jalapeno cream cheese on the side, which tasted so good I ordered an extra bag of chips and cream cheese to take home with me.  My boyfriend got the tostadas. He's a huge fan of Mexican food and thinks this place is pretty great.We also got some horchata, which was delicious. At first I thought it tasted a little watered down, but after a few more sips the cinnamon-y goodness really came through. If you're in the area, I highly suggest Sombrero's.
5	Better than Chipolte anyday!!! For $10 my wife and I got stuffed. The staff was friendly and best of all no long lines (yet). Real Mexican food (not corporate). Fresh food and the Horchata is homemade (best I ever had).
5	Cheap, tasty, and fresh Mexican food.  They have several different types of fillings; barbacoa, green chile beef, red chile pork, carnitas, two chickens, and carne asada, as well as black and pinto beans, fresh guacamole, and salsa that will take the skin off the inside of your mouth (this is a good thing).  And the burritos are the size of my head.  Very hard to beat for the price.
5	I LOVE THIS PLACE! I try to go there at least once a month to get my FIX! I won't go anywhere else to get my hole in the wall Mexican food this place is awesome.it's easy to be a loyal customer with a great customer service an awesome food I will be one for a long time.
4	Chipotle sauce= bomb.com!! For the price of mainstream mexican food you get moms cooking, healthienr and less greasy! and fresh guac, cant beat that! Make it how you want it and leave with a happy tummy! Only weird (for me) thing is everything is shredded, but does make the meat juicier.
4	I was craving a burrito last night and didn't want to stop at the usual suspects (Chipotle/Rubio's/El Pollo Loco/Filib's), I turned to Yelp and this place came up with great reviews. I walked in to the small shop about 20 minutes 'til closing and it looked like just the owner/cook and his daughter manning the ship. I spent some time scanning the menu and when I was ready he helped take my order. I had a burrito with red chile chicken and most of the fixins. They were out of cheese for the night so I got some guacamole gratis which was nice. While the daughter was ringing me up he gave me a sample of their taquitos they have coming out which was good. I drove home and dug in to my burrito, chips and salsa, and horchata. The horchata was on par, their hot salsa is in fact hot and very good. The burrito was really good - it seemed standard before biting into it but it's very flavorful which must be a testament to the care that goes into making all of the ingredients. I'l definitely be back.
5	Great food, great prices, big tasty burritos, and a really nice owner. I'll definitely be back!
5	Hands down the best Mexican food in this area. I've been going here for over a year since I work near by. I've tried other places and none can match them for flavor and freshness. Can't go wrong ordering anything from here. It might feel pricey but believe me nothing else in the area comes close in terms of consistent quality.  I usually get the taco salad or nachos and it hits the spot every time.
3	Went to eat last night at 7pm and it was closed. Suppose to be open to 9 according to yelp.
5	This place is the real deal! Great food, great sauces, friendly service!!!
1	I walked in to this place with a co worker and it is small, located in a strip mall.  I was offended that on the two walls were big flat screen tvs blaring Fox News Channel, loud and annoying.  I asked if they could turn the channel and was told no. that they can't.. I tried to turn the channel myself or even to turn down the volume and it was locked down.. so I turned off both tvs.  The food was average, I don't really understand the hype about the food, there are plenty of Mexican restaurants in the area that don't have a political agenda.  No thanks, I won't be back.
4	This place was absolutely AMAZING.The area looks a little sketchy, tucked in a little plaza that you could drive right past and not even know it was there. My office happens to be just a few blocks away from this place, one day I was craving some mexican food for lunch but I was looking for something a little more authentic than Filibertos(blehhh). Being hispanic, Im pretty critical and picky when it comes to eating at a hispanic establishment, this place was spot on with the flavors. I walked in right way and was greeted by 2 latin women at the counter, the set up was kind of like a burrito bar, like chipotle in way(only way better) you start by choosing your burrito, then your veggies and other toppings, the burrito was as big as a baby! amazing burrito... and that jalapeno cream cheese!!! heaven.
5	The carnitas taco was not disappointing, and great flavor as well.
4	The place looks rough but don't judge the book by the cover. The food is delicious. They have a build your burrito with several meat and tortilla choices. I had the carnitas rojo in my burrito, which was great. The salsa picoso has a kick. The horchata tastes like a vanilla shake.
5	I got the veggie burrito, which was delicious. They had great flavored sauces that were fun to try. The other people with me got a taco salad and that adds.  They also enjoyed their food. The price was great! About $6 each. The staff was very friendly.
4	I really enjoy the food here. There is not much to the interior or the decor. But the food is fresh and delicious. The lady behind the counter is very nice and always smiling. The prices are average for lunch. The options on the menu are pretty standard for a mexican food place, but the quality of the food is great. I think you could say this place is similar to a Chipotle but the flavors are more authentic and less mass-produced if that makes any sense.
5	Fresh ingredients,  friendly people,  good food,  and cheap.  Sounds like 5 stars to me.  The place is small mom pop restaurant.  Come in, order, kinda like Chipotle,  as others have mentioned,  your food is made to order and fresh.  I had the red sauce shredded chicken,  asada and barbacoa tacos.  All good,  but I did like the barbacoa the best.  The only agua fresca is horchata,  I had a Jarritos.  Churros are made fresh as well,  sweet!
5	Awesome. Everything is delicious and at 99 cents for a taco you can't go wrong. I need to make it a habit to eat here more often.
5	The place is not very impressive, just a small space in a strip mall, but the food was fantastic! I tried barbacoa, carnitas, and carne asada tacos - all were good but the carne asada was my least favorite. There are several options for topping your burritos and tacos, very similar to Chipotle. They also have a small salsa bar with fresh lime wedges, which was a nice touch. I will definitely eat here again!
4	Great find. Thank you Yelp!  Fresh ingredients and super friendly ladies making the tacos.  Loved the spicy beef. In dyer need if rebranding to communicate the great quality inside. Awesome food, clean space, and value to boot.
4	Design your own burrito! In a modest, slightly dingy strip mall sits Sombrero's, a small little eatery serving slow cooked, marinated meats, with your choice of various fillings and tortillas.I stepped in today to try a tasty burrito. You have your choice of meats such as barbacoa, carnitas, carne asada, and chicken. Tortilla choices include tomato basil, chipotle, spinach, wheat, and regular flour. They offer fillings such as pinto beans, black beans, cheese, rice, lettuce, roasted corn, onions, cilantro, and salsa. Freshly made guacamole and jalapeno cream cheese can be added for an extra charge. I opted for the barbacoa, with tomato basil tortilla, pinto beans, rice, onions, cheese, guacamole, and spicy salsa. The meat was tender and flavorful. The accompanying ingredients meshed well with the barbacoa. The spicy salsa is indeed quite hot, and packs a punch!I also tried some horchata ($1.99), which was refreshing and creamy.Service was friendly and cheerful. My burrito was made quickly, and check out at the cashier was easy.Sombrero's is definitely a good place for a filling meal!
4	Very good food.  The staff was very friendly and cared about how we liked the food.  They gave us samples to taste and were very genuine.  4 stars instead of 5 simply for the ambiance.  It's just a self serve taqueria.
5	very good food and nice friendly people behind the counter the jalapeno cream cheese is so spicy good
5	I saw some of the reviews and decided to give it a try. The food is magnificent! I had the taco salad with carne asada and pinto beans. The meat has a great flavor and the beans are tender and flavorful as well. Very good place, clean and well kept. I WILL be back!
5	Great food and extremely friendly staff. Very clean place. The food tasted quite authentic... Although I am not Mexican. Had a lot of vegetarian choices for me.
3	Took a friend from Canada here last night.  When we arrived, there was no line, and no hostess.  There was another woman employee on her cell phone, texting. After waiting for 4 or 5 minutes without being acknowledged, I asked the woman if we could seat ourselves.  She sneered "no" and continued texting.  Another very nice waitress came over and eventually got us situated at a little table on the patio. Service was good from then on, food was fine, drinks were fine.  A-ok.
3	They no longer put the chicken back on the grill when you order. The chicken is not big chunks of white meat anymore, it is stewed chicken sitting in a broth all day and I'm not even sure it is all white meat anymore. Another issue is the woman who was making the burrito used her gloved hands to fill the burrito with all the toppings. That is fine for rolling, but when your sticking your hand (gloved or not) into each bin of lettuce, corn, tomatoes, cilantro, etc, it just doesn't seem normal. They need to use spoons on thongs for the fillings.
5	This is *hands down* my favorite Mexican food I've come across in Tempe. The staff is extremely friendly and pleasant, the place is clean, and there is usually a good crowd but never a long wait. I've ordered the asada burrito each time I've gone. It's too good not to get! Don't miss this place!
4	this place has legit mexican fare, the burritos were great and tostadas were excellent too, I highly recommened this place over say a chain place like chipotle or taco del mar
4	Yum. I do love this shop it's close to home very affordable and delicious. Great customer service as well!!!!! Always friendly quick and helpful.
5	Yummy! Good burrito place right in Tempe. Give this place a try. Will be coming back. Got three burritos 1 barbacoa and 2 Carne Asada. All were very good and really filling. If you live in Tempe and want a good burrito I recommend it
5	I'm in love! This place is so freaking delicious! Got the veggie burrito with a chipotle tortilla, yum! Their hot salsa is very spicy. The burritos are huge so I would recommend splitting one. Fair prices. Two thumbs way up.
5	This place is a hidden jem! Very friendly staff and great food. I hope they continue to do well and expand. The kitchen and restaurant are very small so I try to eat before noon to avoid a line. I'd recommend a chicken burrito, they're beef could be better.
5	I recently moved, and I now live very close to the strip mall where this place is located. I was thinking about going to the Subway...I'm glad I didn't. The food is prepared fast, the ingredients taste fresh, and the staff is very friendly. I had a carne asasa burrito and it was very good. I will return!
5	Excellent. Marvelous. Amazing. These are all words that I would use to describe the food and service here. So far, I have had a carne asada taco salad and the quesadilla. Both were delicious but I especially loved the taco salad. They cook the meat in front of you and there are a lot of toppings. The cheese, cilantro, corn, guacamole, and salsa was fresh and delicious. I will definitely be coming back here.
5	The food is worth every penny. Think the speed of Taco Bell and the customization of Chipotle and that's Sombrero's. Throw in a friendly staff and now I'm officially a fan. I'll definitely be coming back.
5	Another great find here...thanks Yelpers! My family stopped in while visiting ASU. Loved the quesadillas and burritos. Tried carne asada, tinga chicken and carnitas meats and also homemade horchata.
4	We stopped in today around 530.  The staff was friendly and the food was great.  We both had carme asada burritos and chips and salsa.  We would definitely go back when we are in town.  We are visiting from Colorado.
4	Tempe strikes again!  Our little city is home to another excellent hole in the wall restaurant.  Many thanks to the staff at Sombrero's for making some extremely flavorful Mexican food complete with friendly service.  This was my first time at Sombrero's and I had a shrimp burrito and really enjoyed it.  The rice, chopped onions, cilantro, chipotle sauce, roasted corn and hot salsa made it a highly enjoyable lunch outing.  I also had the super nachos with carne asada.  Delicioso!!!Sombrero's is a casual spot with 2 large TVs, to satisfy a sports fan's cravings on a weekend.  The high quality ingredients, variety of different meats and salsa bar make it an extremely worthy Mexican spot that can become a regular hangout for anyone that wants to try a variety of offerings.  I know I will be back and I will bring family and friends too.**Tip 1**Load up with not only salsa, but those pickled jalapenos and carrots at the salsa bar**Tip 2**They don't serve beer, so if you need to wash down your tasty Mexican comida with some beer, order the food to go....or have a few beers next door at Boulders on Broadway and then head over to Sombrero's!
5	Don't pass it by.  If you think "hole-in-the-wall" and say, "I can try that", please DO!  This place has some excellent food.  Friendly service to go along with it.  Fish tacos, burritos, quesadillas, all good.  Oh, and if you like hot salsa, try the green sauces.
2	This place did not seem clean and smelled like moldy towel. I don't think there is much more to say about that
5	Visiting from out of town and came here on day 1.  Service and food were fantastic.  We were offered tastes to help us with our selection although we wanted a little of everything we ended up with the street tacos (yum) and the wet burrito (huge and tasty) and the nachos (the works!). We would come back again.
5	We've been coming here for a couple of years now and it is Awesome!!  Really cute place with Amazingly delicious food!!  You tell them what you want and they put it together right in front of you..  Barbacoa is Best in the city!!  Highly recommend you give em a try!!  You won't be disappointed!!
5	I never knew it was right around the corner, thanks Yelp! My first visit was excellent. The food was fresh and delicious. I had quite an appetite so the three tacos were not enough. Luckily, my wife could not finish her burrito. I am sure we will be returning.
5	WOW!!! Blown away !! Excellent food !! Definitely would come back . Thank you yelp for such a delicious lunch . Wonderful staff very Pleasant ! Great place to eat, and to top it off great prices! A++ highly recommended
5	Had fish tacos plowed through them! This definitely going to be my place for Mexican food from here out!
5	Yelped tacos and found this delicious hole in the wall place.  Awesome tacos, carne asada is super good no fat gristle found, all savory meat.  Red hot sauce is extremely hot yet tasty.  Will definitely come back to this place.
5	WOW!!  What an amazing little great find this place is.    I had the nachos with green chili meat.   The meat had virtually no grease and no fat and had a very nice nice spicy taste..mmmm.The vegetables were not only extremely fresh but were piled on high and the nachos chips were crisp and fresh.While I was enjoying this very tasty dish one of the very friendly staff members came up to my table and asked me how the food was.  I was quick to say AMAZING!Don't let the outside keep you away, the food and service was all very genuine and sure beats Chipotle hands down. Definitely my new hotspot.
4	Place is very good, got the super nachos and was a great spice to it and very good portion for a great price! You will leave full when you're finished! Could use a bigger parking lot though! Almost hit someone leaving with the small entrances!
4	I love this place, makes burritos right in front of you. It is worth every penny. Go carne asada burrito with wheat tortilla.
5	Thank you YELP posters that rated this "hole on the wall" restaurant, like so many other "hole in the wall" favorites, this is a sure winner. He even spotted that I had never been here before and offered me samples of the different spicy beef and chicken. I strongly recommend the chicken for its abundant flavor without being "hot". The beef had a nice kick to it with two flavorful versions. I had a chicken burrito as well as one of the spicy beef burritos. Don't be fooled by the location, go in and try the great food. I am also a fan of the real sugar soft drinks from Mexico, the strawberry was a perfect compliment to the rich Mexican style food. The condiment bar is well stocked with a variety of great flavors to enhance your dining pleasure.I think I have to go now, my wheelbarrow just arrived to get me back to my vehicle. Overall you will not be disappointed!! Happy feasting!!
5	this place is near my office , and when im craving good Mexican food  this where i go !!!!
5	As a Latina, I have to say its soooo Mexican in there....glitter murals of Pancho Villa and Frida Kahlo paired with Jaguars and Mayan Temples -- and nothing by salsa musica on the overhead speaker.  I highly approve!  HUUUUGE burritos!...make sure to try the wet ones (enchilada style) --  the sauce is homemade and perfectly spicy.  The cooks are amazingly considerate...asking about your preferences and giving your recommendations.  Great Horchata as well!
5	This place is the real deal - I have been searching for decent Mexican food since I have moved here months ago.You have a choice of several different tasty meats and there is a fresh salsa bar with pickled veg and limes. I ordered the street tacos with no cheese, extra cilantro, pico de gallo and pickled red onions - topped off with a squirt of lime to the last drop. Oh how delicious. The churro also hit the spot. I dont know if there was custard in it or if it was just uncooked dough, but I ate it anyway and it was good  :-)  The staff are fast, efficient and pleasant.  My go-to for Mexican food!
3	Good quality, but not a great value. Like other restaurants of this style - they skimp on the more expensive ingredients and try to fill you up with the cheap ones. I got a burrito and for $8.00 I received about 3 oz of shredded chicken, a tablespoon of guacamole and tomatoes and lots of beans and rice. Even the amount of tortilla chips I received was skimpy. Their salsa is just okay - very watery. The ambiance is non-existent (dingy) and I don't appreciate restaurants that have the news on when I am trying to eat. The guys behind the counters never asked me how my food was. Overrated and overpriced IMO.
3	Good food, but not better than my homemade. :( Service: goodCleanliness: goodFood: goodI don't understand the hype.
5	I picked this place using my usual method; imputing "fish tacos" into the Yelp Find bar and venturing to the closest place I haven't been too. I was pleasantly surprised. The hot sauce was amazing. I'm very glad I enjoyed the fish tacos but if I hadn't, I would've gone back just for the hot sauce.
5	Update: I went back here a few days later because I love fish tacos. I can confidently conclude,  after two visits, this place is great for more than just the tacos. The employees are so personable.  I got this vibe the first time I went as the customers and staff exchanged friendly banter while the staff diligently executed their taco making duties. But it wasn't just a fluke; the people that work here are awesome. It is definitely a business I want to support. They in exchange can support my frequent appetite for fish tacos. I may even go so far as to explore other menu options and diverse my taco experience.
5	What a great place for authentic tacos, burritos, nachos, etc! Came back here a 2nd time on our vaca since we were sure no one could deliver as quality food for such low cost.Definitely recommend the carne asada tacos!
5	Carne asada tacos are amazing. Very clean and well operated. Definitely gonna come here again
4	The tacos are filled with great flavor!! Street tacos, so they are kinda small but not that pricey.:) The fish and shrimp tacos are great! And make sure you get the spicy salsa from behind the counter! Will be back soon!!
5	I was on a mission to find the best Mexican place in Tempe, and found it! The atmosphere is a perfect Mexican experience, the people are so friendly and fast, and the food is to die for.  I have tried a lot of the things on their menu and have never been disappointed, only pleasantly surprised.  My favorite set up for a guaranteed good night is their two carne asada tostadas with hot salsa (I don't usually like spicy, but their sauce was just too good) with a large horchata. My husband's favorite is their three soft tacos with carne asada and carnitas.  You can tell the owner puts a lot of soul into his food by the way he presents his fresh ingredients, and cooks with style and taste.
5	great street tacos and tostadsas! I haven't tried the burritos but they look delicious, the beans are fresh and the workers give you just what you want and the prices are not too bad.. my staple for mexican when I'm in Tempe.. 5 STARS
5	Great food and great service. This a mom and pop version of Chipotle or more along the Freebird style of burrito. Wet style is a good sauce and a little bit spicy. We didn't have tacos, but they looked good on others plates.
5	Sombrero's is everything I want in my neighborhood Mexican joint: The flavors are bold and spicy, the food is fresh, the prices are reasonable, and the staff is friendly.The open burrito with barbacoa is my jam. While I like Chipotle as much as the next person and appreciate their ethical/fresh choices, the open burrito from Sombrero's is MEXICAN food. One day I'll try other things (they let you sample the different meats), but my love for the barbacoa open burrito runs deep and it's hard to stray. My companion is a fan of the green chili beef, which is REALLY spicy--too spicy for me, but he's into that sort of thing.Both of the extra hot salsas at the salsa bar (there's a green and a yellow one) are spicy and flavorful. They're not unbearably spicy, but they'll make you sweat for sure. I thought I only liked tomato-based salsas until I had these. I ignore the others (in part because I always get take-out and the more watery salsas don't travel well).The horchata really does taste like melted ice cream. Get it.I've probably been to Sombrero's a couple dozen times but have been too busy stuffing my face with delicious Mexican food to write this review until now. Thanks, Yelp, for helping me find my new favorite neighborhood spot.
5	Authentic, delicious, and they gave us samples of all of their meat! The spicy ones were incredible PLUS they had tons of salsas, delicious lime-y rice, and warm tortillas. Fantastic joint!
4	Thanks Yelp for another good find.  Small little strip mall place but the food is full if flavor.  Lots of options and the owners were there to gives us some advice on what to try.  I had the three soft tacos with all three types of chicken, very good.  My wife had the four street tacos, variety of meats and she really liked them.  Good prices, good food, great service.
4	Authentic Mexican food at a decent price. I had the street tacos and the serving was more than enough for me. It tasted good and the price was decent. I will come back this place for the food and the service. :)
3	Today, I had the wet burrito with carne Asada.  They generously load the inside with rice, whole beans and veggies of your choice in addition to cheese.  Warning:  the red sauce poured over the burrito has a kick.  I suggest sampling it first if you don't like spicy!  I was disappointed with their cheap plastic forks and knives.  It made eating the burrito a challenge.Overall a good meal.  People line up out the door at lunch, thus the 4.5 star rating.  I however only award it 3 stars!
5	The other reviewers have pretty much nailed it. I had the burrito with barbacoa, and it was better than the same thing at Chipolte (which is good itself). The food was fresh, plentiful, and tasty! I am glad Yelp turned me onto this place not too far from the office!
