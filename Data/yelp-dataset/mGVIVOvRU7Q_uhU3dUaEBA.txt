5	Excellent repair work and easy to work with
1	All staff are in a team meeting and customers are asked to wait. It's been 15 minutes and they are still in a "team meeting". Glad these guys put customers first.
4	Over a year ago I had an accident due to the Charlotte Winter Storm and was directed here by Land Rover of Charlotte. Although my car had to go through some major work, they did a great job.  Joe is a great employee and pays great attention to the issue at hand.This past week I stopped in because I had got hit by a shopping cart in a packed parking lot over the holiday. They were able to pop the dent out and only charged me $100.  All done in an hour, after just dropping in to see if it was something they could fix. Thanks Joe!
