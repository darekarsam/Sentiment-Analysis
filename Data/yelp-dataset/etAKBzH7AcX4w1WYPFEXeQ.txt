4	When I noticed that the Blackcherry Cafe has closed down, and somewhere called Caffe Piccolo had opened in its place, I added it to my list for a visit. I was really pleasantly surprised by what they've done the place, as it's really very smart. The influence is now strongly Italian, with some outstanding sandwiches of offer. It's not the cheapest, but the quality is really good. I'd recommend a visit.Overall, we said: "I thought Caffe Piccolo was really impressive. I look forward to timing my visit better, next time, so I can try their soup. If it's as good as their sandwiches, I will be a very happy chappy."
4	With space for max 20 people, this wee cafe is not great for large groups of tourists and is therefore ideal for a quiet coffee a stones throw from the thronging crowds of the grassmarket and the castle. They serve Caffe Di Canto traditional Bar Mix beans and the latte tastes good. Not too strong and lovely smooth creamy froth. Slight nuttiness in the aroma. The barista let me sniff the beans which were darkly roasted and deeply rich in character, typically Italian. I tried a bean and it was smoky and strong. Other things of note, speciality Sicilian pastries, almond and cardamom spiced buns, plus full breakfast, toasties and bruschetta menu. Also do Italian food including pizza, focaccia, paninis, soups, and cold meat plates. Some outdoor seating. Quiet reggae music in background.
