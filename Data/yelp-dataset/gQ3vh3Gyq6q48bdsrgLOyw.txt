3	Jared! Nice guy. Decent cut. Gossipy local chair shop.
5	I'm the PICKIEST girl of all time.. I've been going to Jared at Yolanda's for almost 2years. He has transformed my bleached hair into beautiful long blonde locks.. Hell tell me no to certain shades of blonde in order to keep my hair at its healthiest. I lo e him and HIGHLY recommend him for blondes and trims and minor cuts.. He always does just enough.
1	I RUSHED to tan today after work. I got to Yolanda's at 7:20PM, only to find that the salon was closed. Both the sign on the door and the listed hours on the website state that Yolanda's tanning side is open until 8pm. I'm pretty pissed that I wasted time driving the whole way from Monroeville to Bloomfield for nothing. I've spent money on (multiple) tanning packages here, but I will definitely be taking my sad, untanned booty somewhere more reliable from now on.
