4	Back in the days when I lived in Karlsruhe, Gold was not there yet. But now every time when I visit Karlsruhe, my friends tell me that Gold is a good place to go. And I agree, it is a nice restaurant, cafe, something like that. Recently I was there for dinner with a friend. We both went for the steak and it was quite good. The fries that came with the steak were also tasty, but the greatest fries or chips I ever had.I ordered some white wine and first was served a wrong one  while taking the first sip, the glass was taken away. The wine tasted good though. Not too much later I got the wine I've ordered that was also delicious.Altogether, the food and drinks at Gold seem to be quite good, the service unfortunately not so much. It seemed a bit as if some of the service staff were either inexperienced or plainly unprofessional. Anyway, I'm sure I will go there again. The interior is simple, light, modern. It's just a nice space to spend some time and have a chat with friends.
