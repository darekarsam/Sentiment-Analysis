4	This is my Aunt & cousin's church that they frequently regularly. I dropped in one day when I was in town... the paster is awesome! He was going over the 10 commandments and I only got the last one (since I was a drop in) but it was told in a new perspective which I thought was refreshing.Also the JR High youth group is VERY awesome!

5	God gets 5 stars and so does Shiloh Community Church! My wife and I love this church. Pastor Jason is great and down to earth. He relates his sermons to your life and adds his own anecdotal life experiences (which are sometimes hilarious). The events they hold are amazing as well like: an Easter Egg Hunt open to the community for free and Tot Town in the summer for only $10. They have a wonderful daycare and even give you donuts and coffee before the service! It is an overall good feeling place to be.
5	This is one of the best churches I've ever attended and I've been going for a couple years now. Pastor Jason is such a gifted teacher and the sermons from all the pastors offer much teaching without judgment or condemnation, just an earnest desire to preach the Word and welcome all people.
