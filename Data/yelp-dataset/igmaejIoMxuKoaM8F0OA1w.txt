5	I can only refer to O'Reilly as the Autozone Slayer. The staff in O'Reilly stores don't have the tendency to walk around like zombies and stare at customers with blank expressions. They are actually quite helpful! I spend my money at O'Reilly when I need parts. i recommend them for your DIY mechanic needs.
5	They've been awesome the two times I've been here. I needed a battery change on a car I wanted to sell. My car must have known too because the battery died the day before my trade in. The manager helped me out, sold me a gently used battery with a 30 day warranty so that I didn't have to pay full price for a fancy one. And he installed it! Talk about a knight in shining armor. Dominic has also helped me too, all super nice, speedy, and incredibly helpful.
5	Knowledgeable, courteous, quick! These guys know their stuff I've been working on cars over 40 years and I've encountered my share of auto parts counter people who should not be doing auto parts counter stuff. These guys are well trained and willing to go the extra mile. If you need something call these guys first you'll get it done right the first time you're  going to call them eventually, so might as well call them first.
