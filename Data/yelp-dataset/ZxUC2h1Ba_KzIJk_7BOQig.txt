4	This is a great Christian bookstore where you can get new or used books.  I recently brought in a box filled with books and I was called a week later with a dollar amount that I would be credited.  So, today I went into the store and I left with several new books and a card for the remainder of the amount.  I love to buy books but after I've read them, they  clutter up my shelves.  This is a great way to trade.  I felt bad for the staff though because their business has slowed because of the construction on Central for the light rail.  It is hard to get to the store.  I had to get there from 3rd Street but I'm sure some people may go elsewhere because of this.  The construction will probably continue for another year!So, I hope people will support this business in the meantime.  I know I will do so.
