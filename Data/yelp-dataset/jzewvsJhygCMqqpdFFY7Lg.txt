4	We needed our backyard to be worked after having a sprinkler leak underground and having all hell break loose with weeds... seriously, it was a jungle back there. After being blown off by a couple other landscaping companies locally we finally found AZ-RY's. Their prices are very fair, they have this great weed killer that keeps the weeds away for 6+ months, and their crew is fast and wonderful. The only complaint I have is getting in touch with them if you need to. Most of the time you have to leave a message and you don't get a call back for a couple days - but they DO return the call.
2	I had received a referral from my handyman to call Ryan at AZRY's Landscaping as I was stating I had some landscape issues.  So, I called Ryan and he came to give me an estimate.  Super nice man and -- please do not take offense to this, but as I do not speak Spanish, it was nice to be able to talk to and understand Ryan, as I had such a difficult time with a previous landscaper due to language barriers.  Ryan's crew did do the initial weed spray that I had asked about but missed a few things, but nothing major.  It was a great weed barrier, however later finding out Ryan's rates were much higher than some others out there.  But so far, no weeds, so I can't complain and it has been well over 6 months (and we have had tons of rain).  However, I could never get a hold of Ryan to get my maintenance on schedule.  I had also requested a quote on crushed rock for my back yard but I never received the quote or the email with the pictures he said he would send me as he was trying to get me to get a certain rock for my yard over what I was wanting.  After waiting months for responses and my maintenance service .... I just called another landscaper since there are about 16,541 of them in Maricopa.  Sad because I really liked dealing with Ryan.  But if they can't return a call, provide the estimate you requested or show up .....
