4	I have finally patronized this salon after dropping off the little one at dance class in the same shopping center.  My daughter and I needed a manicure.  Our service began immediately after we selected colors.  The staff members were friendly but mine wasn't quite as versed in English.  In any case, the manicures were completed efficiently and competently ($12).  What more can I ask for?  The next time, I may have just enough time to try a pedicure.
5	I really like this place. They do a great job and the place doesn't give off a sweat shop vibe like some other salons. The owner did my friends pedicure and was really personable and friendly.
1	Worst customer service ever. Every time I go to this salon there is a LONG WAIT. I'm talking like hours. It's not because their service is good, it's because they have 2 people working all the time and they always tell you it will be 15 minutes and you end up waiting an hour and a half. I just left for the last time I will never go back to NV nails.
