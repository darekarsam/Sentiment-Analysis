4	I have been to Lorna's a couple of times.  She is very efficient and professional.  I was actually thinking about making an appointment to go see her, when I realized I have not written a review for her.  Her spa is inside another one which can be a little confusing.  I like that she does the whole facial with a microdermabrasion at a reasonable price.  I am also booking an appointment for my hubby.  I have been looking for someone who can go a great back facial and I am sure Lorna can do that wonderfully.
5	Love the way my skin feels after visiting with Lorna. She uses many techniques and customizes your facial. Her prices are also great!
5	I had a fabulous facial and microderm abrasion with Lorna.  Lorna gave excellent service and the price is very reasonable.  She is such a lovely and warm person!  I highly recommend her!
