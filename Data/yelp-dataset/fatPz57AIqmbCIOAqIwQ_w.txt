5	Firehouse Subs has great subs, excellent service and a great atmosphere. The subs are made rather quickly and are very tasty. The people who work there are very friendly.
5	Love this place, there should be one on every block instead of crappy subways. The subs are great, service is great. I love the whole firehouse theme.
5	Phenomenal Subs...great tasting with plenty of meat and other toppings. Not like Subway. Where the only thing they offer are Hero bread varieties, 2 slices of some Oscar Meyer type lunch meat, a slice of a Kraft singles type cheese ...cut in half on a diagonal to simulate 2 slices of cheese instead of 1 & some crappy toppings!!
