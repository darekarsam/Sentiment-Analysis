4	This is where I have to when I get injured at work (sorry, i can't tell you where I work or who I work for...ok im a ninja assassin so if I go missing tomorrow...do not look for me, you'll only be endangering yourself and the people you love). All jokes aside, this is pretty legit place, i get in and get out rather quickly, the employees are friendly and attentive. Dr. Stuart will give you visuals to understand what's wrong and why its important and what to do for a speedy recovery.
3	I had to go here for a pre-employment drug screening.(I can't possibly "be a fan" of a drug testing joint, so "A-OK" will have to do)PROS:The staff was friendly;The office was clean;The wait was minimal.CONS:It's weird that they don't give you the lid for your "cup" (ya just gotta hand it to the poor tech, and the fear of spillage is very real!);No sinks in the testing restrooms (which prob has something to do with contamination and tampering), buuuuuuuut still!  I always feel "dirty" leaving those joints!
4	Good service and the manager Mr Todd took time to help me with my final reading for my TB test. Thank you
