5	Not high maintenance but sure enjoyed my one experience here. I had gotten a gift certificate at my bridal shower. I chose the weekend before my wedding. I got the "Pamper Me" package @ $135- salt glow & steam, hot herbal wrap, and 55 minute massage- two hours of bliss- this meant no wedding worries of any kind what-so-ever (I know all brides can relate). It was just what I needed in order to get prepared for my one special day. I was relaxed, clean, shiny, and new. For a goal-oriented person who  wants to mark things off the To-Do list- this is major.The staff is very nice. Very tranquil setting. The music is soft. The lights are dim. Tips are put in an envelope at the front desk.  I would gladly get this package again. I would highly recommend this day spa- they will treat you very well.
5	They moved to another location on Rainbow and Sahara... But this place is Amazing!! I went there as a Birthday gift to my self. I originally went in there for a massage package that included a massage, facial, mani and pedi. The receptionist called me ahead of time to tell me that the manicurist will be out of town. she worked with me to find replacements and she even discounted my package!! She was an angel. The massage it self was wonderful! This was my first time having one so the masseuse was extra careful. I received and Hot Wrap, I literally knocked out for that hour lol except when my masseuse checked on m to see if I was ok..But anyways all in all the place was HEAVENLY lol. I will never forget the friendliness of the staff :)
2	Me and my son went her to get a quick hair cut I told her how I wanted my hair and she took it down brushed it out and started cutting no wash no dry no curl no nothing my son is 7 and gets his hair cut like every two weeks and I was in not mood to sit at his barbers and wait so I got it cut here to make a long story short he left crying saying she did not line him up and that she did it wrong and it was over 50 bucks never again
