2	I salute the employees of this location for putting up with rowdy UNCC undergrads (I should know, I was one).Unforgivable:  Leaving the PATTY off the hamburger.  Imagine eagerly unwrapping your burger at home, only to find a bun, lettuce, tomato, and ketchup.  Tragic.  Forgetting a condiment or a special request, okay, but the patty?  THE PATTY?!  It's been 7 years since this happened and I'm still not over it.
1	Worst Wendy's I been to. Its a very slow hr few cars in the drive tru & a couple in dinning room...The dinning room was a mess while the whole staff in kitchen talking & laughing the restaurant looks messy never coming back to this Wendy's
3	My visit was during lunch so the food was hot and freshly prepared.  The store doesn't have a high sanitation rating. I would expect better from Wendy's. The lobby needed sweeping and no one showed any interest in correcting the problems. The staff wasn't concern about meeting my request for no ice. Guess she thought disregarding me gave her power.
