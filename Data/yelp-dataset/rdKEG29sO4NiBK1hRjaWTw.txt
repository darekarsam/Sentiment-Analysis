4	Being new to the area, we were not sure where to take our Lhasa Apso, she typically has anxiety attacks when we take her to the groomers that are located in pet stores which typically takes most of the day.  Mobile Groomers is not common in the area we relocated from, but we thought it would be a good idea to try it out to reduce the anxiety.  I found Barbara online and  decided to give her a call even though she did not have a rating on Yelp. On the phone, she just seemed like a down to earth person with a genuine love for dogs. I am so glad, we did!! She arrived  30 minutes early for the appointment, was done within an hour and our dog had the best grooming she has ever had...complete with cute purple bows!  Barbara's original rate was much less than what we expected and then she gave us a discount because the dog  was smaller than she expected!!!  We will definitely use Barbara's services again and I would recommend her for your pooch too!!
5	We have been using Barb's Mobil grooming for well over 4 years now since Jack, my Parson Russell Terrier was just a puppy.Barb is the most professional and caring groomer one could ever hope for.It's always been very easy to set up an appointment with Barb, and she's always a few minutes early.She has the most reasonable of rates of any mobile dog groomers in Las Vegas.Jack is always so excited when he knows Barb is coming or when she turns up for his grooming.I rest assured knowing that he is in good caring hands and I have nothing to worry about .Barb just has a special way with dogs. I wouldn't think of using another dog groomer.Jon N. Eastside Las Vegas
