1	Employees are unhelpful and very rude. Took me 2 minutes in this location to realize that I need to stay with Verizon. I wouldNot reccomend this location to anyone!!!!!!
5	Very helpful staff with knowledge. It is a little slower that other tmobile stores but that just means that the reps give you all the attention. The guys there helped me transfer everything from my old phone to my new one and helped me finance my accessories. Thanks ! :)
1	Have been pleased with t mobile service for 15 years, but this was worst store ever. We were ignored for about 15 minutes,  then we told the tmobile guy our phone worked fine, but our sim card gave an error message once in a while. He put in a new sim card and then the phone wouldn't work at all. He told us too bad,  we need to buy a new phone. What? ?  It worked fine when we walked in, and then he told us our sim reader was "jacked" and the only solution was to buy a new phone. I left and called TMobile, and they are sending us a new phone no charge. Stay away from this store! Poor customer service and staff is not knowledgeable.
