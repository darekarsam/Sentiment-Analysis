3	Nice small little park, right beside some great restaurants. Grab some food to go and sit in the park, and enjoy your surrounds!Go Portugal!
5	it doesn't have that park feel for me. its more of a quiet space to cool off in the busy neighborhood. like everyone, this is a 3 stars kind of place. the only reason its getting a 5 is for their awesome karaoke day they are having.from what i know, this is the 1st edition and from the le plateau mayor's mouth (who did perform too), it looks to be a success and they're considering coming back next year.so, that karaoke day. its an amateur karaoke so anyone can join in the fun and perform in front of a small group (or could be bigger) and to any bystanders and drivers passing by. and to top it off, this is sober karaoke. SOBER! which means that you won't hear drunk singers "performing". of course, you'll hear some bad ones but that's because they're bad but you'll hear some good ones too. the range of songs is basically anything they have on hand, can be some old french songs to new ones to classic english songs to more popular. i even heard some spanish at the end.its a fun afternoon. hearing old, young sharing their skill or making a fool of themselves. all in good fun!i heard an old man sing achy breaky heart.. thought no one could top this until someone went all bon jovi.. and then, someone outdo it with their rendition of celine dion.. if only someone would do francky vincent lolhopefully, they're going to do more interesting events in the near future at this park so it'll be a must stop in the neighborhood
