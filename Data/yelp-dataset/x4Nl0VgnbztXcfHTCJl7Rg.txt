4	Went here today when I crapped out at the Lane Bryant a few doors down.  Their stuff is a little more modest compared to Lane Bryant, which is just my style.  Yeah they have a lot of polyester and 'older lady' stuff, but there is some nice stuff here for the younger crowd as well.  I was looking for a dress and a nice woman (Laurie) working there helped me pick through the racks for something.  I liked the dress she chose but went with cotton over polyester because of the heat.  Great customer service here.  When I was done two employees were standing near the exit both wished me a good day and thanked me for shopping there.
5	My mom is an average bigger woman...she recently had a breast reduction surgery, and she has been feeling extremely "body-conscious".  I decided to treat her to some birthday shopping in the area, and I'm happy we stopped in Dress Barn (terrible business name). They had a variety of styles, color palates, and cuts that looked great in her! Some size selections were unavailable, but that's typical with an average retail shop.  The sales staff was welcoming and friendly. I'm happy that my mom is happy, so I think I'll bring her back for some more retail therapy this coming Xmas season.
