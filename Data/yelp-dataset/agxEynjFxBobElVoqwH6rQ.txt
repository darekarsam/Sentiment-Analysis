1	I'm not sure about the dance academy??? The pre-school part definitely needs changing. The teacher apparently has never taught 3-4 year olds and has no idea how to encourage a crying child missing his mommy. Who puts a 3 year old in time out for crying on the SECOND DAY OF SCHOOL?!!! seriously, I would never recommend this school to anyone. We immediately withdrew our son and the crying stopped after the third day...Kids can tell when teachers care.
5	Elite has trained my little girl perfectly! My daugher has been in the performig group for the past 7 yrs. She and her group always place high in all dance competitions they participate in. My daughter's technique is strong and precise. I have Elite to thank for that. My daughter has grown into a confident, expressive and caring young lady.Most importantly, she loves going to dance every day. Her whole group enjoys,  learn, and have fun on a daily basis.Take it from a former professional dancer and former dance studio owner, I wouldn't take my daughter anywhere else.
5	My son has attended this academy for the summer and LOVED it! The teachers were very good at keeping the kids in his class on task. I am planning to enroll him and his brother next season :) Plus boys get a 50% discount which is awesome!
