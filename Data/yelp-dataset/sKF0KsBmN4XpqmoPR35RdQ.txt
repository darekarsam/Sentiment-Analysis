4	Went here for a wedding cake tasting it was really good can't wait for the big one. So far so good taste is everything.
5	After many cake tastings, my thoughts towards cake had been solidified. My entire life I had not been a fan of cake, until I tasted Grace's. She made the tastiest cake ever! So moist and so many options. I loved how personable she was. My entire experience was just overwhelmingly great. And our guests are still raving about how amazing our wedding cake was!My husband and I had a vintage chic wedding and she was able to do the most beautiful piping I have ever seen. It was interesting trying to find someone with this talent now days.I recommend Grace 100x over and over again! Our family will definitely be using her in the future!
5	Our wedding cake was SO DELICIOUS! Grace Tari is an absolute pleasure to work with. I'm pretty sure that cake tasting was my Husband's favorite part of the entire wedding preparation process. She has so many wonderful flavor combinations that it was extremely hard to just pick three combos (one for each layer). Grace was really wonderful and listened to exactly what we wanted. We couldn't have been happier with the outcome! Our guests were super happy too and commented frequently on how moist, flavorful, and delicious the cake was. The favorite combo of the night Lemon Pistachio cake with the Lemon Raspberry filling. My fave was the Red Velvet with cream cheese but my Mom definitely loved the German chocolate cake with white chocolate and raspberry filling. All soo tasty! Our cake as gorgeous and delicious and we couldn't ask for me. Thank you, Graceful Cake Creations, for creating such a beautiful and delicious cake!
