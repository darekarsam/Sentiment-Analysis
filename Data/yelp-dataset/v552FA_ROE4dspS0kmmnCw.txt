5	My Wife and I have had many great experiences.  We have had multiple Acupuncture treatments with Krissy with great results.  Not only is she very knowledgeable, but also real nice.  At this point we must have referred at least a dozen people to Krissy and everyone thanks us later.
5	Krissi is the BEST!  She is more than accommodating with her busy schedule and very informative about all the work she does.  Her acupuncture has helped me get my life back!  My back pain was reduced with just three treatments and her bedside manor is awesome!I will continue to see her and recommend anyone who has never tried acupuncture to start here first!CBPfautz
