4	I come to the mall fairly often, even though I'm from way out of town.  This is my go-to place in the mall.  I've tried others, and found them less satisfying, but love this little place. The quality, portion, and selection are great. I usually get the grilled chicken, the grilled steak, the hummus, the garlic spread, the grilled veggies. All delicious!
3	For mall food, I guess it's okay.I'll start by saying I'm an English speaking American.  So please take my judgement based on that.  I don't truly know the standards of Montreal food.  But compared to some of the other Middle Eastern/Mediterranean establishments I've even at, this one is really middle of the road.The beef I ate was good.  Tasty.  Rice was dry though.  The wrap didn't taste particularly good.Overall, middle of the road.  In that mall, though, it looked like the best choice.  It was well populated at lunchtime though.
5	Great place. chicken is amazing well grilled and juicy, so is the 3 meat plate. love the 3 bean salad as well.The quality, portions, and selections are great.
