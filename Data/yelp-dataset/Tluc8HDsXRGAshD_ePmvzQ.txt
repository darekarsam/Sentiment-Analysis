5	This has to be the NICEST group of people I've ever dealt with at Chase. Mind you, this location is inside a Fry's grocery store, but they still provide all the services a normal Chase has... without the wait, long lines and ditzy tellers filing their nails. I always come here no matter what. It's convenient because it's in the area, and I love that I can get groceries/bath products all in one trip. If you're in this neighborhood, check this branch out.

1	The teller was extremely rude and all but called me a liar when I came in to cash a Chase check my husband signed over to me. We have the same last name, I had my ID, and signing over checks is still legal...so why wouldn't Chase honor their check? Uhm. I'm guessing because the concept of customer service is foreign to them. There is a happy ending nonetheless. Many thanks to Bank of America for waiving there fees and cashing this check like the professionals they are.
