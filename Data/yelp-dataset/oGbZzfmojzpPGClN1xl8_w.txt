3	This is your typical mall fair sushi.  Nothing overly outstanding.  But, if you're in a hurry and need to satisfy that sushi itch, then this place will be perfect. It's a good amount of sushi for the price, too.
2	Thought this was just so-so. Maybe I should have stuck to just sushi rolls, but I decided to get something warm and went for the tonkatsu ramen.For $10, the ramen was on the smaller side. The noodles were not thick and chewy, but instead the kind of thin noodles you get in an instant packet of ramen. The chicken tasted a bit artificial (similar to McDonalds / Subway chicken) and a little rubbery. The broth was also not flavorful. All in all, it was disappointing.The tekka maki roll was ok - nothing to write home about. I was hungry and it was edible but it's nothing I would go out of my way for.I had higher hopes for this place, but will probably go elsewhere.
2	Not too bad for a sushi-to-go place. The pre-packaged rolls are pretty bland w/ tons of cucumber and avocado rolls. If you want some fresh sushi, I suggest taking the time to dine-in instead. The ramen was below average for a $10 bowl but it's a mall sushi place after all. Their "designer sushi" was pretty interesting. Tried out one of their Hako sushi and it was actually pretty good.The only complaint I have with their prioritization skills. I group of 4 ordered the 60-piece giant platter right before me during the lunch rush hour. Just b/c those people were fine with waiting 30-40 min doesn't mean the rest of the people in line were fine with it as well. They ended up assigning all 3 sushi chefs to making the giant platter instead of doing a 2-1 split. My ramen came in 10 min and I had to wait another 30 min just to get my 6 pieces of sushi...
