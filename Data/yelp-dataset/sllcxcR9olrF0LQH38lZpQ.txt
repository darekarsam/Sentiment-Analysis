1	I would give it less stars if i could. Worst customer service ever experienced. Called for delivery and the guy didnt pay attention to the order and once he got it, he hung up without asking what type of payment method we were doing and he didnt take the entire order. I called again and told him we were paying with a card and as soon as he took the card number he hung up. I called a third time asking for the manager and she was rude, didnt even apologize for the bad service. Food took like 40 mins to get to us and it wasnt as good.
