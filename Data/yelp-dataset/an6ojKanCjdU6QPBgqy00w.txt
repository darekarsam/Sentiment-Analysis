4	This is a great place for lunch in the Quartier Latin (Ste-Catherine St.) area, near Berri-UQAM. I go there often for lunch. Service is quick, food is healthy and tasty. There is a choice of at about 10 different salads (greek, pasta, Asian, mango + bell peppers, spinach, apple, potatoes, legumes, cabbage) and as many sandwiches (mostly paninis, but also wraps, and they have many vegetarian options). They also have baked goods (muffins, croissants, biscottis, cookies, cakes...). I like their combos (I usually have sandwich + 2 salads + drink for 11$ taxes included). They also have one or two kinds of soups. They serve coffee and expresso drinks but they only have decaf in espresso drinks (which is not included in the combo, but I got away with a decaf Americano). There is a lot of people who take the food away so even if it's often busy, I never had trouble sitting down, even right around 12pm. I wish the cutlery were re-usable (instead of disposable). But it's one of the best deals in the area, with a wide variety of choice for lunch.

Thinking of Il Panino and its rich, nutty coffee in normal-sized cups makes me miss Montreal all over again, and remembering the tender, flaky pastry wrapped around a nugget of sweet, earthy almond paste -- I'm a little misty-eyed with the memory.Ah, well. Next time I end up in the dreaded green monster's lair, patiently explaining to the barista that I want a small coffee, not one of the three large sizes on the menu, while the woman behind me taps her foot impatiently and the guy behind her broadcasts his personal conversation for all to hear, I will remember you, Il Panino, and drink your health from south of the border.
