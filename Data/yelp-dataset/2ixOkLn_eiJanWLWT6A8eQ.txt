5	Love the Girls.Love the shop.Love the neighbourhood.I did my first tattoo there and my experience was just perfect. I recommend this tattoo shop if you are looking for a chill atmosphere, where you will feel comfortable at any moment. Both the artists are super cool with you, they put you in a great state of mind and keep you relax. I recommend that place for anyone who is looking for doing their first tattoo.
5	I just got my first tattoo from Bodin this past weekend and I cant thank the ladies enough. We showed up at around 5pm (they close at 6). Jessi and I chatted about the font of the letters I wanted and the location on my wrist. They fit me in for a 6:15 appt. I showed up on time and Jessi was ready. I was out of there by 6:35 - the tattoo itself took about 5-10 minutes. I still think tattoos feel like i am being pinched and electrocuted at the same time...my husband laughed endlessly at my silly faces. Thank you Bodkin!
5	In October, Nicolas Durand tattooed my inner arm with a beautiful sunset. He was amazing. He took me and my ideas seriously,  brain stormed with me, and is incredibly talented. It was such a joy to bring a simple idea in, have the space to talk about it's significance, and feel understood. The fact that is beautiful in addition to the fantastic service made this the most satisfied I've ever been with a tattoo (I have 10). I think I found my East Coast artist.
