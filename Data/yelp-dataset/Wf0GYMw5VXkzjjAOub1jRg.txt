1	I have been here a few times because of proximity to my house. However, I will no longer be giving this place my business. The last few times before this visit my order was given to me incorrectly.  Today, when I orderes a large combo I was told by the manager that they don't give large drinks with combos. She said this to me while standing under a sign that clearly read "With Any drink for an additional charge." I am quite agitated by this place and there is a perfectly good Carl's Junior just down the street.
1	Worst mcdonalds ever.You always get hounded by the homeless and management never seems to do anything about it.Something is always wrong in your order.I've had to have them remake orders 3 or 4 times.I've had them over charge.  Lie to me. Swear at me in Spanish assuming I don't understand.The restaurant is always filthy and no one seems to have a clue Avoid this mcdonalds. If you must have your burger fix head to the mcdonalds at 24th street and osborn. It's clean, no homeless problem and they actually give you what you order.
