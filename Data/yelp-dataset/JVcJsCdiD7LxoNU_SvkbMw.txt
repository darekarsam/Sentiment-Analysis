5	Great little Drum Shop! Ron, the owner has great customer service, is friendly, knowledgable, and will point you in the right direction!I just purchased the Istanbul Agop Xist cymbals from him and was able to get me a great deal on them!Ron goes above and beyond the call for his customers and loves sharing the art of drumming and educating drummers, like myself.If you visit him, please be sure to write him a review on yelp!
5	Phoenix only independent professional drum shop with knowledgable, friendly and service forward owner/operator.  Amazing cymbal inventory as well as beginner through custom drums, hardware, sticks, drumheads and cool accessories.  Everyone should visit this place.  Bravo!
5	Small, hidden gem in the valley, tucked in the back of a shopping plaza but worth finding. Ron is helpful in finding the best match for you and the sound you are looking for without trying to up-sale anything. The prices are right, no need to shop online anymore. I will definitely be returning for future needs (and wants).
