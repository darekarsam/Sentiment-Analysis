5	I am so thankful for JR!! I stumbled upon his shop since it's near my new office, as I was desperate to find someone to fix my fave pair of nude summer wedges. JR was extremely friendly, he reassured me that he could make my favorite shoes 100% better and it would only cost me $45! Well worth the cost to get another season or two of wear.I dropped the shoes off on Thursday and he promised them by Saturday at noon. They were done in time and perfect.
5	JR Shoe Repair is the best!I got a pair of my work boots resoled great quality and great work!Would recommend A++++++
5	What a hidden gem! Great service and excellent job on my favorite boots. Typically at a cobbler you need to leave your shoes for a few days. The owner knew it was important that I have my boots for the weekend and it was a Friday afternoon. He kindly did them while I waited. Fixed both heels, shined up and they look brand new. The price was great too. I highly recommend.
5	I happened to stop in to have some watch batteries replaced and was very impressed with the workmanship, value, and service.  I saw that they also did jewelry repair, so I returned with a bracelet that had a broken clasp and a missing link.  Again, the workmanship was excellent and the bracelet looks as good as new.  Reasonably priced, too!
