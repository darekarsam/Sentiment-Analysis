3	I'm not normally a chain coffee shop fan, much preferring to find that needle in a hay stack small, one of a kind cafe, but given the Gyle offers little in unique experiences, I've taken to frequenting Costa every now and then and, I must say, am pleasantly surprised. The coffees are consistently ok and the friendly service a standout. Not bad at all.
5	Coffee is good , service is excellent but sitting area is cold and draft.
