3	Decent prices, usually decent customer service. Annoying having to carry bags and a two year old out of the store due to carts having to stay within the store.
5	Usually fully stocked, clean and friendly. Lines can get long but at the most busiest times of the day. The only Ross I've been to where everything is kept nice and clean, and doesn't make you feel gross and creeped out. Definitely a place to check out if you're a bargain shopper!
1	Junk shop. Rarely find anything.
