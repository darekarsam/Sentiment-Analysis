5	This tiny room next to Datcha is not immediately evident, the window is slightly hidden and there is no number on the door. But if you are in front of Datcha and tuck into the door between it and some indie fur designer place on the left, you'll find yourself immediately at home. Datcha is the size of a small narrow livingroom, or boat, or coat room. There is a bar with a few plush stools and hooks for your coat, and a skilled and friendly bartender happy to chat about the different delicious cocktails, or art, or New York, or life. I tried the champagne cocktail and it was perfect, and perfectly pretty, and prettily suited to the sweet room. I didn't try the food but the drinks were all in the non-insane, totally affordable cocktail range, and very delicious, plus I love me a romantic tiny tucked away room, so I'll be back here for sure.
4	This place is cool, more appropriate than the intense dance music in its connecting bar Datcha.Kabinet has cool outside seating, lots of nice cocktails, and a generally nice atmosphere to hang with friends for a bit and have a drink. Far better when not too crowded though.
