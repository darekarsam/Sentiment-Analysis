4	Service was slightly less than courteous, but the food was excellent and quick. Would def do again.
1	Rude service and over priced over cooked food. Everything was really greasy and had a reheated taste.
5	The good is great and fast. I love eating here for lunch. You can usually have fresh cooked food in 5 minutes or so. The delivery is also good and very reasonably priced.
4	We ordered take out on New Year's Eve. The store was very busy but our food was ready on time. This was our first time at Jumbo Dragon, the food was really good and the price was right on target. We will be back to order takeout again.
