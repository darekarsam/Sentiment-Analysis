5	We went here for our anniversary dinner.  The menu here changes often, so I will just say that this place is a foodie's dream.  Fresh, innovative and tasty courses served by informative, polite and courteous staff.  Definitely get the tasting menu, and if it is not available, have them put together a selection.  You won't be disappointed.It is intimate, so I wouldn't recommend for a large gathering.  But for a special dinner it is perfect.  I would make a reservation in advance, as it was quite busy.  And they have wine.
5	The place is unpretentious, sincere and serves amazing food.  what more can you ask for?
1	First off, my boyfriend and I were excited to try out this restaurant. We went to Montreal last year during Labour day weekend and missed out on our chance of eating here due to time restrictions.This past weekend, I made sure to make a reservation. Thought I was being smart ... that is, until we cabbed it from our hotel all the way up St.Laurent to be pleased to find a beautiful sign in pure French stating that it was not open - giving no rhyme or reason.1 star because I have no choice but would love to give them 0 stars. They take down numbers for a reason - to call us. If they had called and left a message stating that they will not be open I would have been fully understanding. This is unacceptable. LUCKILY we found our way south and randomly popped into a nice restaurant called "Le Comptoir".NEVER returning again.
