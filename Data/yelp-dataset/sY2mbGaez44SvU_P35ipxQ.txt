5	Great tailor. They get it right every time!
5	I am a 53 year old professional speaker, and have lost a lot of weight over the last 6 months. Historically, I have used an Italian born tailor for all of my alterations. However, being in a pinch, I went to choi tailoring for some major alterations in my jacket and slacks. (Major). I was shocked on how perfect the alteration was done. It was if the suit was rebuilt in Italy!  I have gone to other places for quick fixes before, and got what I paid for. And had belt loops within one inch of each other, or the jacket buckling when I sit. I can tell you with certainty, that choi tailoring is likely the best in the valley if not the state.
5	Great turn around on service. I came last minute to get something altered and they did it without any complaints. They also gave me a military discount which I appreciated.
2	This is for the dry cleaning part.A little sketchy. You drop off your clothes. The man gives you a receipt after you fill out your name on his part. He has no clue how much a dress, a scarf, and 2 decorative pillowcases will be, so you leave. Come back when they say, give him your part of the receipt, which he keeps...everything looks clean on first check, so that's good. You pay, get to your car and think, where is the receipt they usually staple to the plastic bag? I have no proof if I get home and something is wrong that I actually took it there to get cleaned. Hmmm....their business model could be improved-upon...just sayin.
5	Husband needed suit pants hemmed.  Quick turnaround and very affordable.  The finished alteration looked awesome, and you would never think it was under $10.  I would highly recommend if you need simple alterations but don't want to pay the ridiculous prices that other places will charge.
