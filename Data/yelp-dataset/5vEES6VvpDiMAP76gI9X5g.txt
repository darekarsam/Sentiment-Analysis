5	Top knotch client service & superb knowledge of our transaction!!  I highly recommend Desert Fairways Realty - I will use again & refer friends.
5	Teri at Desert Fairways Realty did such an amazing job in our search for a new home! She is very personable and friendly, and worked so hard to find my wife and I the perfect home. She is very knowledgeable about the real estate market in the Phoenix area, and her negotiation skills were top notch and helped us get a great deal on our home. When my in-laws moved to Phoenix from Puerto Rico, she also assisted them in finding an awesome home. If my wife and I decide to move in the future, we will definitely contact Teri again!
5	Teri is beyond amazing! This was my first home purchase and I had already started on a bad foot with another realtor. Teri was recommended to me by a friend and boy was I glad I made the switch. It was a tough market at the time (cash buyers), but she was up for the challenge. She walked me through each step of the way and ensured that I was comfortable and confident with the contracts we submitted, through escrow and closing. The home I am in now is the one we both had a good feeling about and I could not be more pleased! I have my realtor story to tell everyone and have the envy of how well my realtor truly cared about me as the client. Any real estate business in the future is sure to go Teri's way!
