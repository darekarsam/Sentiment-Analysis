5	Dr. Matt Paige has been treating my daughter who has been going through cancer treatments since 2011.  He and his staff are always friendly and know just what to do.  Dr. Paige has been instrumental in helping our daughter through the many different symptoms that accompany cancer treatments.  His holistic and mainstream approach helped her body to heal itself along the way.  We are so very thankful for him and his knowledge that he has shared with us and our daughter.  Thank you Dr. Paige for all you do.
