5	Group Fit is simply top notch! It is not a typical gym, you will not find people aimlessly wandering around wondering what to do. It is a group fitness experience with scheduled classes that will yield results and have you feeling stronger and leaner than you have in years. The workout is intense, but they will adjust it to meet the needs of any fitness level. I have been coming to Group Fit since before they opened their doors last year and haven't done the same workout twice. The friendships built also create accountability. I would give more stars if I could!!!
5	Group Fit is best way to maintain an effective and fun workout routine that yields results! I am constantly challenged by the workouts and held accountable by the members.  I am stronger than I have ever been and feel great! The instruction allows you to push yourself harder than you would alone and create variety to avoid plateau.  It is a great atmosphere to reach fitness goals and have fun!!
