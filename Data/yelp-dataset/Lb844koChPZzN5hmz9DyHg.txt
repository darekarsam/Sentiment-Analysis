5	I love zappos!!I admit I shouldn't even be shopping online all the damn time because my credit card will be maxed out.. AGAIN! But I just can't help it...Zappos was introduced to me by my sister, another shopaholic.. I hate you! (I love you) They have just about anything you need.. Jeans, clothes, bags, SHOES, accessories, eyewear.. I like that they have so many brands and some I haven't even heard of.. My new favorite brand of shoes.. Naughty Monkey.. Their shoes are so gorgeous and affordable!They have over 1,000 brand names on this site! Ranging from 7 of all Man kind, Harajuku, Marc Jacob, Michael Kors, Kate Spade, Citizens, Chip and Pepper, Diesel, NAUGHTY MONKEY, and so many other brands that I have never heard of!Free overnight shipping, 365 days FULL return, and 24/7 customer service!!!When they say free over night shipping, they mean it. I ordered a bag on here and thinking since it's the holidays I would get my bag on Wednesday, which is what it said on UPS. Next thing I know, my package came on Christmas eve! SCORE! I can't believe how fast they were at getting my packaged shipped. I LOVE YOU!
5	I just ordered my first bag from Zappos!  I am extremely impressed with the free shipping both ways! This is practically unheard of, & will shop with confidence knowing I can always return an item (easily) if it doesn't fit or I don't like it!They have a great selection, too! I live in a smaller bay area town & don't like to have to drive to S.F. To find cute designer bags/shoes! I will DEFINITELY be a return customer of this site!
5	I've ordered spa slippers from Zappos.com three times now and every time, it is a great experience! I almost bought the same products from shoebuy.com to save $20, but after looking at their reviews, I realize that it is worth paying the extra $20 to know I'll be getting great service and lightning fast shipment.
