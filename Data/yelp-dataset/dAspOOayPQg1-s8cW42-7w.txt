5	I've had to use my roadside assistance twice in a week. These guys were under the estimated time for ETA on both occasions, the drivers were very nice, and they showed that they cared - something you don't expect from a stereotypical tow truck driver. Only downside, is that they don't take cash tows yet. Meaning, when I called directly, they had to refer me to my roadside assistance provider (Agero, contracted through Country Financial Insurance).I would definitely use them again and only wish that I could hire them on the spot. To top that off, their contracted price covered up to 18 miles under $100. Can't beat the price or the customer service.777 - Thanks for getting me off the freeway in rush hour traffic!!
1	I work for a towing company here in town and one of my friends just called their insurance company to have their car towed.  Seeing that the insurance company doesn't give you an option on who tows you car and it was my day off.  When the towing company finally showed up 2hrs after requesting a tow.  It took the driver 3 TRIES to back up to a car that was parked straight on a residential street.  I had to show the driver the hook up points on the car so he could winch it onto the truck.  I watched him for at least 20 mins under the car trying several different hooks and he had no luck.  I would never use this company for any type of towing or road side assistance based on this guys lack of experience.
1	Waited 2 hrs for these morons and nobody ever came. Luckily a Good Samaritan came by and jumped my car!! What a joke! Thx aholes as I waited 2 hrs in the 105 degree heat! Call anyone but these people!! They are liars, kept giving me all kinds of excuses why they weren't there yet!
5	7/10: Showed up early within the estimated time frame. Tow truck driver named Howard was very friendly and funny as well (this is appreciated during a somewhat stressful scenario). The ramp used looked pretty cool too. Car was towed in a quick and timely manner. Hopefully I won't need to, but I would use and recommend 777 Towing again!
1	if there was a negative they would def get it. Worst customer service ever.i was two minutes from my job and the stupid tow guy wouldnt stop.we past my job and he was a total dick about stopping to let me jump out. he never once made me feel at all comfortable. He wasnt nice,he never smiled not once.the dude was a complete jerk as if i was an inconvienance...he looked at me with no facial expression then turns to mu husband and says "whats up brother".I guess my skin wasnt light enough.If this is the tow company my insurance has chosen,i will be cancelling my insurance for sure.thanks 777 towing for nothing.
5	I liken car towing to having my teeth drilled.  I hope never to need it done but if I do, I hope it'll be quick, painless and unmemorable. My experience with 777 was quick and painless but certainly not unmemorable... because it was THAT good. Here's the situation:  I had just come off a 13 hour shift.  I was tired, hungry, and had to pee like a racehorse (sorry, way TMI).  But the only thing that mattered at the moment was getting home and all my other needs could wait.  So I hop into my car, and turn it... wait, what? OK, try this again.  Turn it... uh oh.  Turn it... on?  Maybe?  Uhh, no, not quite.  My mind races, quickly trying to figure out how to get in touch with roadside assistance.  "Is it in the manual?  Should I google it?  Maybe if I keep trying to turn the car on the problem will fix itself.  Man, I'm hungry.  Where in the manual would it... damn, I gotta pee."  Yes, this is the flighty mind of a tired nurse when her car won't start at the end of the day.  Finally I noticed, in the corner of my eye, on the corner of the driver's side window, the answer to my burning question... and there, my friends, was the Kia Roadside Assistance sticker.  (Go ahead, point and laugh at me.  I deserve it.)  Called up, gave my VIN number and a quick explanation of my issue and after hanging up I immediately got a text with 777's contact info and their ETA.  The tow truck arrived within 20 minutes, and 20 minutes ahead of ETA!  The mechanic was so super friendly.  He was professional, efficient and very helpful.  As you probably already guessed by now it was the battery.  Turns out, these things aren't meant to bake in the sun for 12 hours a day.  Who knew?  He had me up and running in 5 minutes and I didn't need a tow after all.  I don't think anyone is ever happy when they need a tow truck... but despite my full bladder and empty stomach, I was thrilled with the fast and friendly service and was glad to have had 777 respond to my call.  And if you get the choice of who to have tow your vehicle, I highly recommend 777 Towing!
1	Hey!  They hit me!  Ran into the BACK of my car and did over a 1000 dollars estimated damage.  What's really great is that they had no insurance!!!  What the heck kind of tow company does business without any insurance?  Worse yet, they have refused to cover the damages.
5	I've had two instances in the past two years where I needed a tow truck. Each time, my insurance co picked this company. They have always arrived before the time estimated.This last tow a few days ago found me stuck in a parking lot. The car would start up but was quitting after going over bumps. So I decided rather than breaking something important, I would opt for a tow.We did a few quick checks as to possible easy fixes but none of those were the answer. So it was towed to the shop and the guy was very courteous along the way.Whether it's 1:45 am in the morning and you are stuck on the freeway, or if you are stranded in a parking lot, I'd call this tow company again. Hopefully not for a long time though, because car problems are lame.
5	I recently (1 hr ago) broke down in a parking lot. The ignition to my vehicle would not catch. I contacted my insurance company and they dispatched 777 Towing. The driver Camron (sp?) was dispatched to help. He came over and ensured that the issue was not something that was easily resolved. He then hitched up my beast (a beat up 88 Ford Bronco) and towed me back home. He was quick, efficient, courteous, and excellent at his craft. I was very appreciative of his assistance. Absolutely no complaints about service what-so-ever.
5	777 is the company that my insurance company contacted when I needed my classic towed. They were timely with arriving, and Moe, the tow truck driver, was extremely friendly and personable. This was an excellent experience and, while I hope I won't have to have my car towed again, 777 will always be who I want to use and definitely who I will recommend to others.
5	Okay, here is the deal...I never post my experiences with any company because they really need to go beyond the call of duty to get my praise, but with 777 they warrant one.  By the advise of my insurance carrier they dispatched 777, they were fast, on time and their driver was very cordial.  It was after hours and unfortunately the auto shop was closed and 777 was unable to leave my vehicle there because of liability reasons (which I appreciated) they were actually concerned about the safety of my vehicle. The driver suggested we drive it to my home, which we did.  I phoned the next day to repeat the process and believe me the experience was the same! Stellar, on time, cordial and once again they were concerned about my vehicle and my overall experience.  There are many things I expect in life and great service is one of them and 777 exceeded my expectations! you cant go wrong with them.
1	They were 8 miles from my location. It took them a two truck to come to pick me and my truck 3 hours. Their reasoning was " oh i thought you would not be with the vehicle" . Prior to that I called asking them how long they would be after an hour. They said one hour then I called again an hour later, they said 20 mins. If I could give. Negative rating I would. Their customer service is garbage. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PPL.
1	I've been sitting waiting for over an hour for my car side assistance through my insurance company . They called and told me an hour then another hour , then 30 minutes and yet they still aren't here ! Horrible company very slow and will ask my insurance company to never send them for me again . If they could get negative stars they would be a -5.
1	Too bad it isn't possible to post zero stars!  Do not waste your time with this company.  If your insurance company tells you they are sending 777 Towing, tell them to send someone different.  If they tell you that 777 Towing can be there sooner than any other service, don't believe it.  After being told they would be there in 45 mins to 1 hour, the next message was that it would be 90 minutes.  When that time had passed, it would then be another 30-35 minutes.  When that time passed, it was then going to be another 30-35 minutes.  After a LIVID discussion with them, got a call from the insurance company that their truck had broken down and they couldn't make it at all.  That was never mentioned in any conversations directly with them.  Insurance company contacted another towing company, and they arrived exactly when they said.  BTW, this was all in the middle of the night with the car in a dangerous location on a freeway on ramp.  Stay away from 777 Towing.
1	0 stars for this joke of a company! I needed a tow for a simple flat tire so my insurance set me up with them and told me the ETA was 1 hours, which seemed like a while for it being 2am. After the hour passed I asked a friend to meet me at the gas station where I was to pick me up. Long story short another TWO hours passed with many calls back in fourth about how he was "10 minutes away" or "right down the street". When the driver Tom finally showed up he seemed a little intoxicated, of course no apology also. Completely disgusted with this company to the point where I would walk home rather than call them.
4	My car overheated and after calling my insurance and requesting roadside assistance,  I received a call from this company not even a minute after I hung up the phone. I was told they would arrive within an hour and they showed up after 30 minutes earlier than I expected. The driver was very polite and opened the passenger door for me to get in his truck. Kept up some pretty light conversation on the way to my auto shop which prevented any awkward silences lol. I'll be using their services again (hopefully I don't have to). :)
1	What a piece of crap company. I have been waiting for  five count it five hours to have my car towed to my house. Upon calling I was told 90 minutes so I waited, 90 min goes by I call again 45 min this time, then 30, then 15. So I call the insurance company and they tell the agent it will be another 45 min she asked them why they never called to report that and the cow on the phone has no answer for the agent. So an enteraining couple fight, and begging tweeker and six other tow truck sighting later I finally called and told my insurance company to cancel it and told them to go F them selves. THIS COMPANY SUCKS.
1	777 is the worst company ever made me wait 230 hours for a tow u have to  be dumm if u hire this company, their excuse was their driver was delayed, what kind of a company is this that only has one driver, if u don't have the people to do the job don't offer your services very upset please don't hire this people let's get rid of the bad company's (trash) to make room for actual good company's
1	After much back and forth (I kept having to ask the dispatcher to slow down because she slurs her words so bad she's nearly indecipherable), it was determined that roadside assistance could not help us because apparently we have super special lug nuts. We were not given a choice in who was coming to tow us but they told us that it would be the next day. This meant that we had to arrange for my husband to get a ride to work and we're not sure how he's going to get home yet.The driver called and asked for our address, which was weird because we gave all of that information to dispatch already. I gave him basic directions, our address, the building number and the gate code, and a description of the car. He called back half an hour later and asked for the address again. Then he called back another half hour later and asked what side of town we were on, he blamed his GPS for sending him the wrong way. Then he called back five minutes later and said he was outside the complex, which is weird because if his GPS had sent him to the other side of town, he would have been almost 1/2 hour away. I gave him the gate code and directions into the complex including our building number and a description of the car again. He called back five minutes later and asked what building we were in. I told him again, and told him I would come down and meet him.I came down with my very well trained golden retriever who was on a leash. He freaked out and told me that he was afraid of dogs and to keep it away from him. She did not come anywhere near him but he acted like she was a rapid pitbull. Then the rudeness amped up.He asked where the car was. Again, I found this weird, because he already had a description of the vehicle, it was the only one in the parking lot, and, oh yeah, it had a flat tire. He backed up his tow truck and left it running as he got out to look at the car.He chastised me for getting a tow for a flat tire. He asked me why we didn't just change it ourselves. I had already explained to him that we tried, but apparently we have super special lug nuts that no wrench would fit. Roadside assistance had been out last night and they couldn't help us so they told us we had to get a tow. I wasn't sure why I was telling him the story again. He took out his own tire iron that had four heads on it and tried all four, none of them fit. He seemed very agitated and wanted to see our tools so I popped the trunk and he started digging around. He said "well you should have a special tool" then climbed into our car, opened the glove box, and took everything out of it. He never asked, he just did it. He seemed to take personal offense that we didn't have some sort of adapter.He asked me why we were getting it towed to the place we were. I told him we were told where it would be towed, we were not given a choice. He asked me another question that I didn't understand so I asked him to clarify, then he raised his voice at me and got red in the face. I told him I did not appreciate him getting angry with me when his question was not clear. He said that he was not angry. I guess that means he was doing that gritting teeth angry voice for no reason.He then got on the phone with dispatch. He asked her a bunch of questions and apparently didn't like her answers so he handed the phone to me. She told me the same thing they had told me earlier, that they were taking it to a specific place where the tire would get fixed and we didn't really have a choice - it was an insurance thing.The whole time the driver was making wide circles around me while my dog just sat there looking quizzically at him. She didn't move, but he acted like she was an alligator trying to eat him.Keep in mind that it was over 100 degrees and we're just standing out on hot pavement. I tried to keep my dog in the shade but both of us wanted to go in. Since nothing had changed and we were obviously not going to get anywhere with the driver, I asked dispatch if she was done with me. I gave the key to the driver and returned his phone. I left. He made no attempt to contact me after that. I guess I will have to call my insurance agent to find out where they took my car.I will probably get bashed for this, and I don't care: No matter what your religion is, keep your dog hating and your misogyny to yourself. You have female customers and you need to learn how to deal with them. Be polite. At the very least, cover your disdain toward women. After all, we are often the ones who sign your paychecks.
1	**UPDATE**Pretend you are a tow company. Pretend one of your drivers is so incompetent that he towed a client's car to the middle of nowhere and then throws away the keys, not bothering to tell anybody what he's done. Now, pretend that the customer has called repeatedly wondering where her car is and is about ready to report it stolen. What do you do?If you are 777 Towing, you do absolutely nothing.So, my husband goes to the repair facility to pick up the vehicle. They have no idea where it is. He calls 777 trying to find out where our car has gone. They swear that they took it to the facility - that does not help us as it obviously was not there.My husband walks to the bank to try to take care of some other things while I get on the phone to raise some hell. Again 777 tells me that they have towed it to the facility. It is not there. They have no other answers for me. They refused to allow me to talk to a supervisor. They ask for the same information over and over - none of this helps me find our car. I am near reporting it as a stolen vehicle and giving their driver's description to the police.Desperate, I call the facility one more time and ask him if maybe it was put in the back or he missed it or something. He goes for a walk around his property and asks me if it is a dark blue Avalon because there is one parked at the Chevron next door. Yes, that is our car. He says he does not understand why the driver didn't let him know he was dropping it off, he was open at 7:30, or why the tow driver would leave it in a different parking lot.Three calls later we still do not know where the keys are. Apparently the driver, DJ, is an evening driver and nobody can get ahold of him. So it is perfectly acceptable to tow someone's car and drop it in an arbitrary place then hide the keys, not tell anyone what you've done, and sucks to be you, I'm taking a nap.My 5th call to 777 finally gets me a manager who says he will be "spoken to" and that they cannot do anything else to help us.So here we are still trying to find the keys to our car that he towed to an arbitrary place.  My husband is stranded on one side of town and me on the other and all the tow company can say is, "oh we will speak to him."I. Want. Him. Fired.777 will not tell me his actual name. He goes by "DJ" and that's all we're allowed to know.**NEXT DAY FOLLOW UP**My husband had to take a bus to our car in the middle of the night with a spare set of keys. We were lucky that we found someone with the proper tools and willing to come to the gas station where the driver dumped our car, mainly because he has nothing to do with 777 Towing (in fact, he said he would never use them).Realizing that 777 isn't even going to have the class to call me to tell me that they talkd to the driver and found out where my keys are, I called them back. After being put on hold several times, they finally told me that he said he put them under the driver's seat. Which, of course, is yet another lie. Our seats fit flush to the floor - it is impossible to put anything underneath them. When I called back to let them know, they put me on hold again, then they hung up on me.Multiple apologies from Maribelle the dispatcher is not enough. I want compensation for all the time and energy that we wasted trying to find our car, including the all-day bus pass that my husband had to purchase. I want another set of keys. I want DJ fired. I want to hold his pink slip in my hand. I want to write on the report for his unemployment application how cruel and incompetent he was and that he does not deserve UI benefits because he chooses to not do his job. I want him to be forced to take anger management and customer service classes. I want HIM - in person, with no excuses, too apologize to both my husband and me.
1	Do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY from this company! Hands down the worst tow company ever! Car broke down cause of a bad alternator and dead battery. Called my insurance company and they referred me to these idiots! 777 said they'd be an hour so I waited. An hour passed and I called for a status update, and they said they'd be another 45 mins. Called the next hour and they said they were just 10 mins to my location. Called 15 mins later and they said the same exact thing. Driver then drive to the wrong location and I waited another 30 mins. If I knew it would've taken them 3 damn hours to arrive, I would've waited in the bar across the street rather than waiting in an empty parking lot in 100 degree weather because if I wasn't by my vehicle when they got there, they would have just left. NEVER AGAIN!!!
1	police report filed on truck driver!!!!!!!!stay away from this company they towed my car to the wrong location and stole my personal belongings they are incompetent thiefs they need to be put out of business i have filed a police report on the tow truck driver
5	Found myself trapped at work with a car that wouldn't start even after a jump from a coworker. My insurance company's roadside assistance patched me through to this company. They were well within their hour ETA. Got calls following up from the company and my roadside assistance company to tell me when the driver was on the way and to check on the service. Our driver, Howard, was quick to check out my car even though I reserved them for towing services. He brought jumper cables and was able to assess the problem with my car. (I was silly and left the hazards on while I was unloading things in the morning and had left them on all day. I thought I needed a starter or an alternator and was prepping myself for worst case scenarios and $$$ repairs.) Without judgment or chastisement, Howard gave me the information to leave my car on and to drive for 10-15 minutes to recharge the battery. He popped the hood and checked out the rest of my car components before he left. I was very relieved with his findings and extremely glad to hear my engine go on. I got home safely and have plans to replace the battery soon.Thank you, Howard! I couldn't have asked for anything else.
3	Can't say how their service is when they arrive, but after having called them and been told 20 minutes. Then called them back and being told the driver ended up having to go to Boulder City, and it would be another 40 minutes. I called and had another tow truck from a different company come and assist me.
1	Drivers were driving crazy in the freeway with 2 cars in tow. Speeding, not using a blinker and crossing 3 lanes of traffic like is was nothing with total disregard for others!! I called the manager who simply stated "I will talk to him." Really?!? You will never tow my car or family with drivers like that!
1	Ill keep this as short and concise as possible. My expensive car stops on the freeway at 11pm. Called Liberty Mutual roadside assistance who requested 777 Towing. They arrived in a reasonable amount of time given the time of night and my location.  Driver was polite. I told him to take it to their yard and then 1st thing in the morning have my car taken to an auto shop. I provided the name and address of the auto shop to Liberty Mutual and 777 Towing. I tipped the driver $20 and said please take car of my car. The following day at 1:45p,  I called the mechanic who stated that my car hadn't arrived.  I called 777 Towing, who told me that they did not have a flat bed truck to tow it (huh, all morning?)....but that it would be done within the hour. Ok. 1 hr.  Not excited over the morning lost, but ill take it. At 5:15p, I awakened from my nap before the gym by 777 Towing with, "Hey, whats the address again of where your car is going?" Oh the thoughts running through my mind...why did you wait till after business hours to call me when the auto. shop has closed, why wasn't it delivered when promised and why didnt someone call me at the 1 hr mark to say that they won't make it and how many automotive repair places do they know of that are open after 5p?Anyhow, they will be keeping it another day then delivering it tomorrow. I will definitely examine my car for damage. Unfortunately,  they have lost my trust.
5	Naturally, a tow company is not going to get many good reviews. It's bad enough to have your car towed, but any little thing that goes wrong is just going to make that experience worse. Progressive roadside assistance contacted 777 towing and gave them the closest open garage to help me out. 777 showed up maybe a little later than they said (5 minutes). However, I understand when traffic was as bad as it was. I was stuck with a dead battery in the Linq parking lot during a large outdoor event. Caesar was my driver. He was friendly and attempted to jump my battery to no avail. He loaded my car safely, drove safely, and made me feel comfortable. Although my insurance handled the costs for the towing, if I had to resort to my own means, I would have gladly paid for this experience.
5	This tow place works in association with Superior Tire & Goodyear for discounted tow prices & they're super fast too! I called them on Friday afternoon @ 2:30p & I was picked up by 3:30p!! Super clean truck with AC & a very friendly & polite driver! I will call them again if I ever need it!! Great company! 702/724-9006 or www.777towing.com.
1	Had to give them one star just to get this review in. Truth is...They get no stars. Zero, Zip. Zilch. They treated my wife disrespectfully, and then dropped the car off at the wrong address. Avoid them if you can.
1	RUDE....RUDE...RUDE service from driver...not that a tow truck driver needs to be nice, but they do need to be professional and empathetic considering people are frustrated over their vehicle. I ONLY used them because my roadside assistance is covered through them but i will request in the future not to use them.
4	Wonderful service. Came within 20 minutes after roadside dispatched them, they call you as soon as you get your message from roadside and were there so quickly! I had my kids and they helped me put them in the truck while my car was hitched to the tow truck. Really nice driver.
5	Just had my car jump started by Naji. He was so fast and professional!!! Thank you 777 Towing!!! :-)
