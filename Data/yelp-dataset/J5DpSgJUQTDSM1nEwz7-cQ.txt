5	This is an excellent small bank that treats their customers with respect. My branch is Bell Rd and 7th St. They are all friendly and you can even talk to a real person if you call the branch, no automated mess to try to navigate through.  Highly recommended. I moved all my accounts from Bank of America to Midfirst and have been very pleased with the difference in service.
5	The customer service at this branch is phenomenal. My husband I are always treated exceptionally well. It is a lot of small touches that make this bank a standout.  The staff is personable, the atmosphere inviting and a complimentary water and coin machine are an added bonus.  Even the safe deposit box area feels better than most banks.  I would highly recommend this particular branch of Midfirst Bank!
5	Not your typical financial organization they treat customers as other financial institution should. Recently switched my accounts over here from a larger institutions by the recommendation of another Nelson Lozano went above and beyond to help my wife and I get our business straight there . It's great when you walk into someplace you may have only been a few times and then remember your name without looking at the computer we finally found a home bank
5	Thumbs up to MidFirst bank. We have our business account with them and there was some fraudulent activity. They caught it before I did and acted immediately saving me what could have been a lot of money. It just reaffirms our decision to move our business to this great bank. Antonetta and Nelson have been great to work with.We first went to MidFirst when looking to refinance our business loan. Tom (at 64th & Greenway) went above and beyond to pull off a complicated deal. Now after this I am even more impressed with the bank and the staff. Thank you MidFirst
