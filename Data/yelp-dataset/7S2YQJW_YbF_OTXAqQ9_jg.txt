2	Very disappointed by this place. Maintenance and upkeep on a minimal scale. Faulty wiring, drafty windows, missing screws, doors that fall off the hinges, leaky toilets, insects, windows that don't close all the way, deteriorating stairwells, no doorbells....there are SO many other properties in this area that render this place useless. My advice is to drive around the corner or even across the street or a few blocks down.  It is obvious that the renter is simply a statistic here.
5	As a partner in the property management industry, I have to say that this property has already seen so many positive changes in the past few weeks.  The staff is very welcoming and it has become one of my favorite places to visit.
4	This complex was recently taken over by a new management company. They have been helpful and friendly. I am very excited to have the dog park on property they plan to build. However... the prior management was underwhelming to say the least. I am very happy with the new management thus far. They came out same day to address a concern I had with my dryer. Jasmine, the property manager was happy to listen to my maintenance request that were not addressed by the prior management. Hopefully the better service does't equal increased rent!
5	I had a problem with my a/c unit. I called emergency maintence at 4:30 am. Not only was Josh quick to respond to my maintence message, he was also very friendly. Thank you so much for fixing my air conditioning and being so polite!!!
