4	Got a great hair cut here from "Eric." My hair lays well, he suppressed my cowlick, and did a good job cleaning up my neck too. Nice job!
5	Went here for the first time today on the recommendation of a friend. Micah did a great job and I'll definitely be back next time I need my hair cut!
5	I have been coming here for about a year.  4 or 5 barbers there have cut my hair.  They all do a great job, are courteous, and the price is reasonable.  The barbers all know what they are doing and are attentive to details.  I have nothing bad to say about this establishment.  Excellent barber shop.
5	Took my 4 year-old here and he got a great cut. I was very impressed with the barber! I will be coming back to Douglas Barbershop again!
5	I called looking for a specific cut for my 9 year old and 6 year old son. They got them right in same day and did the exact cut my boys wanted! So happy with the cuts! Great place!
1	I DO NOT recommend this barber shop!  Not even to my worst enemy!!  My son asked for his hair to be cut, 1 inch on the sides, and 1 and a half inches on the top.  My son also told him how he likes to gel his hair up in the front.  The barber scalped his hair shorter than a fresh military recruit!  And then tried to blame it on my son, saying he wanted it that way, a 1 on the side and a 1 and a half on top.  I hate to break it to you, but inches are WAY different than "barber numbers"!!  And this guy was supposedly the "Manager"!?!?  He wouldn't speak to me when I asked for the manager, so I had to confront him while he worked on his next victim.  Completely unprofessional, no compassion, no customer service, and I'm pretty sure he was on drugs of some kind.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!
