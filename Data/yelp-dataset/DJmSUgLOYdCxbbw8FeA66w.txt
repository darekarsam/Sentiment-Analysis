2	I stopped for a breakfast due to my flight being delayed.The cappuccino was acceptable, as was the table service.I ordered the breakfast burger, made with Scottish beef, bacon (English style), and a "fried" egg. The egg was microwaved and the yolk was not left runny as I asked. The burger was also cooked extremely well done to the point where the inside resembled the outside.Despite the poor cooking methods/technique, the burger was flavorful. The chips were also good and had an appropriate amount of seasoning.
3	We went here to grab a quick bite before catching a flight.  The menu is ok, nothing to rave about.  Nothing really shouted "EAT ME".  I choose the spicy tomato pasta.  It was a decent portion but it just didd't have the depth of a good sauce, not like a proper homemade itaian sauce.  I could go saying mamma mia.  The wine I choose was an african one and was really nice.  Service was ok although we did have to ask another table if we could use there salt and pepper as there were none on our table.  the OH had chowder - which again was the run of the mill. `Alright for a quick bite to eat but don't expect any wows.
1	The service was so slllllllowwwwww.  The food was decent though.
