5	Claudia...you are totally amazing. I took my car to Amigo's based on the review (no 's') that I read on Yelp. This woman went on and on about how honest they were and how they go above and beyond...AND SHE WASN'T KIDDING!She greeted me very nicely and I swear, this is the only time in my 35 years that the mechanic came out of the back of any shop and explained and told me exactly what I needed. I told Claudia and the mechanic that I was thinking of getting new rotors and do you know what they said, "You don't need them right now, just the pads and a small shaving will do it." She even called three shops to get the best price on my brake pads! (They don't sell them, just install them)Wow! They did an excellent job, the squeaking and rubbing is gone and the car rides smooth without any other problems that seem to "pop up" after a repair. Take your car to Amigo's Auto Rebuilt Exchange...I've never felt so good about spending money with a repair shop.
5	I've always had a great experience working these guys! More than once they have gone the extra mile to help give me the best service. They know what they're talking about, honest, and fair. I give my recommendation!!
5	I needed a rack & pinion replacement for my 2000 Honda Accord and they had one rebuilt in stock. Their price was half of any other place I checked ($150) and most places were out of state and would involve 3-5 days shipping. They have a clean professional looking shop and not only do the installation, but also computerized 4 wheel alignment, again at half the price of other local shops ($40).The Manager is Dominick who seems very knowledgeable and friendly. When they started the alignment Dominick said i might need a camber kit and I thought "Here comes the hard sell!"  but after getting the car up on the rack he said I didn't need it !!!! Dominick is very honest and I'm glad I found them.  I will definately use them in the future.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHOP.  VERY HONEST AND GREAT PRICES !!!!!
