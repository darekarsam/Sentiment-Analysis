5	Kerol's Kitchen produced some of the tastiest Malay food I've had outside of Malaysia and having lived there for 2 years...I'm picky. Would absolutely order from Kairul again!
5	Kerol prepares authentic and absolutely delicious Malay cuisine.  The mee goreng and beef rendang in particular rivaled some of the better options I've come across in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.  The prices are a steal for the quality and quantity of food he provides.   I couldn't recommend Kerol's business and cooking highly enough.
