3	I got a cheese pizza delivery from here once, and I feel like...it's one of those places where it's okay and if that's what someone put in front of me I would eat it, but I definitely wouldn't go, "OMG, let's eat there!"It was just boring to me. (And I love cheese pizza!)But some of my coworkers like to eat here on occasion, so maybe some of their other stuff is better. I wouldn't know.

4	I got pizza here on a Saturday night in a pinch.  Looking for a place that sells by the slice, I drove around for a while.  Not only did they have by-the-slice pizza, but they also had some of my favorite toppings.  I also hate crust that's too thick, and -- although I prefer it even thinner than it was -- I was pretty satisfied with the crust.  The only thing that could be improved is the salad.  We got a grilled chicken salad.  The chicken and fries were okay, but the rest was pretty run of the mill.As for the pizza, I'll definitely be back for more.
