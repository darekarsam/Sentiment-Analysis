5	This is a MUST SEE Zumba studio! Great sound system, HUGE studio, and plenty of parking! Scheduling of classes is throughout the day...a BIG plus for a 24/7 town! A great team of instructors (check out their website)! Until recently, Vegas offered a limited number of classes during the day and Zumba instructors who are more than aerobic instructors with Latin music!
