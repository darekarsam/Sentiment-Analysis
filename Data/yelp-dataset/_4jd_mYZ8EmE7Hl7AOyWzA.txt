4	Big fan of the staff here as well as Dr Novak. I began going as a first-time patient of any chiropractor and he has made me believe a believer. I have had lower back pain on & off for 5+ yrs and went to him when I woke with excruciating pain one morning. After just one session I could feel partial relief. I went back several more times over the next couple weeks and it helped a great deal.The best part is that they can pretty much always fit you in the same day as you call which is fantastic.
5	I first found the Newman Chiropractic Center about 2 years ago when one day, my lower back pain got so severe I could barely walk. I called one or two other Chiropractic offices first and neither could see me that morning or even that same day. Dr. Novak at the Newman Chiropractic Center was able to see me immediately and since that day, I've never even thought about going anywhere else. Whenever I need an adjustment, I simply call ahead and let them know I'll be stopping in; they are extremely flexible and understanding of my busy schedule.I look forward to visiting the office for an adjustment because I know that when I leave, I will feel amazing. The office itself is not as posh as you might find other places in Shady Side but it's welcoming, comfortable, and certainly gets the job done. I have and will continue to highly recommend Dr. Novak to anyone who is need of Chiropractic care.
5	Best chiropractic center I been to others Dr Novak and staff are the best in the Pittsburgh area they are concerned and problems always taken care of excellent adjustments  I always feel better after I leave there
