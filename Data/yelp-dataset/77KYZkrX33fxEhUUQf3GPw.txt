4	Located in the Forum Shops with a wide selection of all things Western those who know me would likely find it odd that I'd even visit Kemo Sabe, let alone make a purchase, but recently taking a fancy to a few esoteric bespoke items I stopped in today to check out their selection of leather goods and happened upon a gem in the form of a carved shoe horn nearly two-and-a-half foot long for less than 1/3 the price of a similar, though less interesting, model at Wingtip in San Francisco.  Pure craftsmanship, friendly service, and bargain pricing in a Las Vegas Boulevard Casino?  Its almost fortunate the rest of their gear is intended to get someone "cowboyed up," otherwise I think my wallet would be in trouble.
