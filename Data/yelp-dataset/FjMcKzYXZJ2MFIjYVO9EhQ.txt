5	Awesome place!!!!  Even though they specialize in LS1 swaps they still do all the other work that my Escalade and My work van need to stay running on the road properly. Great service fair pricing. Love these guys!!!!!    Honest and fair with no surprise pricing when you pick up.
5	PRK did a bunch of work on a Nissan Titan for us to get it ready for sale. In the end, the jobs were all done to our satisfaction...we didn't want to just get it past a buyer, we wanted it to be "right" so that we could sleep at night. Randi and the crew only do work they can stand behind, so it was a good fit. Doing it right helped us get the correct money for the vehicle. Thanks!
5	AWESOME job performed by PRK!  My truck wouldn't start...They had it towed in and discovered the fuel pump and module went out, generally, and easy fix, but they went the extra mile and discovered there was a bad wire that caused the module to burn out.....I highly doubt anyone else would have found the main issue, a bad wire....These guys are the best!
