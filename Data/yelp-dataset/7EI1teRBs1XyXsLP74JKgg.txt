3	I have never used this CVS for their pharmacy, but stop in from time to time to pick up a few items when I am already in this shopping center for a Trader Joe's run. The store has a nice layout and is easy to navigate to find what you need. The aisles don't seem quite as cramped as they are in some other CVS stores.
4	I love this CVS. My husband and I walk over often to explore the redbox (outside) and pick up an occasional ice-cold coke zero or whatever random things we need. The self-service photo printing kiosk is a quick way to print photos, and the associates are courteous when they are needed to type in a code to allow the printing to begin.I'm always greeted with a "hello" and am able to quickly find what I need and check out. Great selection of all "drugstore" type things.I don't really like going anywhere else.
