5	I stumbled across this store on my way to Nest.  They are right next door to each other.  I love, love, love the furniture here.  It is very expensive, very high quality and very traditional.  The store is small, but it jammed packed full of furniture and fine accessories.  I have been looking for a classic design floor lamp and they had some real impressive designs.  I also liked several of their wall mirrors as well as buffet lamps.  Nice artwork.  They also employee professional designers to guide you in designing your perfect new room.
5	Had a wonderful experience with our purchase at this store.  I went to browse, found exactly what we were looking for!  No pressure, wonderful quality furniture lines.  Amazed they made one call and the delivery company brought our purchases out that day.  THRILLED!!!
2	Walked around the store for 10 minutes with no acknowledgement from the staff. There was no other customer in the store. Only person to say hello was the mover guy who was putting together a bed frame. Stuff seems nice...on higher end of price range. I'd be willing to pay extra for quality goods, however, if it includes decent customer service. This place, at least today, didn't offer that.
