4	Oh. My. God. Covet by name, Covet by nature. I almost walked straight past this little shop on Thistle Street until I smelled the top quality leather of the handbags. I back-pedalled, and spent a good 10 minutes practically drooling over the gorgeous handbags and other accessories on display.I'm not going to lie, there's no way I'll be buying anything from here any time soon. Mainly because there's not an overdraft big enough to make that possible. But one day, when I'm no longer a tax-dodging student and have hopfully managed to get myself a career, this will be my first treat to myself. And possibly the second, third and fourth...
4	If you ever want to look at accessories (mostly purses) that no one else would have. Go here. Even though the bags cost a fair deal, doesn't mean that you can't own other little accessories. They have headbands, bracelets, earrings, etc that are all so pretty! My favourite part is their colourful range of change purses. They always spread them out in a way where it looks like a rainbow of delight!I suggest just walking in to see one of Edinburghs great independent accessory shops!
