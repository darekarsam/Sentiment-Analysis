5	This is a very nice barber shop. I felt very welcomed. I have two boys with two very different texture hairs. My youngest (6) wanted a frohawk and my oldest (10) wanted a mini Afro. Mr.Shea did a great job.
5	I used to work with Mr Shea. I decided to go to his barber shop after cutting my own hair for the past 20 years or so. I wanted a new bald fade. I previously called earlier in the week to make an appointment on Saturday. Tank ended up cutting my hair. Excellent job! Will be going back every two weeks!
5	I don't know why I am just now writing a review but I love coming to this shop! My boyfriend has been coming here for 4 years and has never had a bad experience. He and Mr. Shea are great friends and when Mr. Shea isn't available, Tank cuts his hair into his customary faux hawk and always does a great job. They make you feel so comfortable and if you bring your significant other or your children the vibe adjusts accordingly. The prices are pretty reasonable l. Its not in the best part of town, but the personality of the place makes you feel right at home.
