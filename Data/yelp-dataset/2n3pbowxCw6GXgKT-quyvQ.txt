1	If only yelp offered 0 stars! At 10om this evening (Christmas Eve, by the way), I received a call to our Handyman Service from the owner Shawn Spanier. His office had been vandalized (broken windows). He had no idea what he needed or even the size of the window! We grab all our tools, wood, and anything we thought we could need. When we get there, Mr. Shawn is standoff-ish and rather rude. He tried to say the thick OSB was flimsy and would be kicked through. When we explained that is what is on homes and people don't kick through it, he called us unqualified. We went and got all the materials needed to compete his emergency after hours job, and he told us never rmind doing the work, he didn't care we drove to get his materials. We have ben building commercial and residential for over 25 years, this man has no idea what he is talking about. I am letting all my service/contractor friends to NEVER do work for this man!*CAUTION: This man DOES NOT pay his contractors/vendors/worker....BEWARE!!!!!!(for Christmas, he made us leave our families, buy supplies, and drive across d=town to repair his office, then refused to pay!!!!)
