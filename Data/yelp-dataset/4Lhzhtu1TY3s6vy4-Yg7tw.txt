5	Oh. My. God. Special #8, choice of general tao, sauce on the side for the pineapple chicken, white rice instead of fried rice, comes with egg rolls and cantonese chow mein, for 1 person. all for $11.95. I cannot get enough. It's enough to feed 2 people, and to make you STUFFED. best. thing. I. ever. discovered.
1	I had a General Tao chicken diner along with a side of dumplings. The dumplings were thick and doughy, and the filling was very bland. Chicken was way too sweet and greasy. Veggies were a soggy mess, and the imperial rolls were just soaked in grease and really bland. Took over an hour to get my food, just to throw most of it out. Not only will I never eat here again, I'll make sure that my friends don't either. Such a waste of food and money.
3	Just finishing up dinner from here right now. I ordered a wonton soup, chicken with broccoli, and steamed white rice. I asked for Lo Mein noodles but they don't make that so maybe this will get me to try different things. Person I spoke to on the phone spoke clearly which was nice. Delivery was prompt. Wonton soup was good though there was more broccoli than chicken in the main dish! It was a large portion and I think that next time I see if I can get a size smaller. A good first experience. Oh, before I forget, also not too pricey..all of this only for eleven dollars.
1	this place is turning into a mess. on two occasions now they got a part of my order wrong but offered to bring me what i ordered. I expected them to bring me the entire order and take the crap that they originally delivered, but they didn't. They just brought me what they had gotten wrong, a half hour later. Which means that the food that I originally received was cold by the time I received the completed order, a half hour later. Total wait time was an hour, half of it wasn't edible anymore because it got cold and gelatinous. such a disappointment. Also the people on the phone are rude as hell.
