3	Was invited to go for my friends birthday. I really loved the concept and the decor. The music was way too loud (note I am not a old woman. I love loud good music) but this was to the point where we could not hear what the person next to us was saying. Drinks are good and so are the prices. The service thow...... it took a while to get served. Then she forgot one of the orders (food not drink) then I ordered my second drink and some food. I got my drink but not food, my friend then wanted to order. The waitress said she would come back and take it....... 30 min passed. All in all not great service and load music. I would try it again but then if it still disappoints.... I'll give up.(Note.....I never got my food. By the time I got the waitress the kitchen was already closed :(  )

Super cool! There were statues of the Virgin Mary, along with rosaries and voodoo beads. The bar's light was red which gave it a creepy yet cozy and intimate feel. Beer bottles hung as lights.The service was great. Our waitress always came to our table with a nice smile on her face. She was attentive to us, asking us if we wanted another round of drinks or food. The music was good too; a mix of punk rock music. The prices are great too. Very affordable to eat and drink the night away, especially if you're sharing shots and pitchers. Can't wait to return, I think my friends and I will be regulars.
