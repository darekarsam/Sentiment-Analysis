5	I am new to eating at Churches. This is my second time dining with them and I was pleasantly surprised at how clean this store was. I say this because just across the street is a Jack in the box which accepts food stamps which means this neighborhood may be rough. I can see back into the kitchen floor and on the battering counter where the food was being freshly prepared and they were both clean. Everything in the dining room was freshly clean as well. The young man who I believe is named Ysidro and he was exceptionally nice knowing that we are newcomers. Not being from here I am not used to someone serving me being so nice. Thanks so much for the fresh and tasty food as well as great service!
1	The first time I went to this location, the chicken was dry and kind of hard, like it had been sitting around awhile.  I gave the place the benefit of the doubt and came back a few months later, during the weekend.  Same thing.  I noticed both times the place was empty, so I'm pretty sure the food just sits there until they need to replenish.  I understand they just can't throw out the chicken after a certain amount of time, but seriously...it was not a pleasant experience. I usually go to the one on 35th & Cactus cuz it's on my way home from work--always had fresh chicken there, though the area is so ghetto. My bad for giving this place a second chance.  I won't be surprised when they go out of business.
1	They wouldn't except a coupon that expired a day earlier. Chick fil A takes any coupon even if it not from their store because that's what brought that customer in. Plus that person chose to eat your product. This is bad business.
