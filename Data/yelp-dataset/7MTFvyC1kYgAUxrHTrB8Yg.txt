4	When my Yelp/iPone directions accidentally took me to the Chevron across the street instead of an AMPM that I originally wanted... I figured I'll just get it over with and stop here. I think there was only about 8 pumps here? Which... quite honestly doesn't matter cause the lack of traffic still let's you choose whatever pump you want. Inside, the store was pretty clean... all the standard stuff you're looking for and they even had a Pizza cafe that we didn't use, but thought was pretty cool!
5	Every time I go there to buy propane the staff is so helpful! I believe Daniele (hope I got that right) helped me this evening-Feb 10, 2014 . What great customer service she provided. Honorable mention goes to the counter attendant, too! Happy Valentine's week everyone! -Pilot
3	I love this Shell Station as they have a cash price which is usually $0.05 cheaper a gallon. The pump area is small though and can get very cramped to the point where one car will frequently block the next pump. Parking is also a bit cramped too. The convenience store is just your regular typical convenience store. Nothing special. The lines tend to get long some times. This location also has a propane refill station, a seldom used car wash, and a smog station. If you are in the area the smog station never really has any customers so you can be in and out. Location tends to get crowded around 3 or so when the school next door gets out, turning out gets challenging as all the parents block the intersection and don't like to let people out. Overall a pretty ok Shell station.
