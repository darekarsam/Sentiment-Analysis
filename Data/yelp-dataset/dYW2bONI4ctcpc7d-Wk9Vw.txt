3	Nice and easy to get into this location from just about any direction - even if you are headed into town (though it does require an almost-u-turn).  Getting out is just about as simple, though you might have to deal with traffic on the way out, and that can be a bit of a headache.As Stephen has mentioned, the food typically comes out quickly, and the staff at this location is generally nice as well - something you do not always find at all fast food places.On a purely personal note, this McDonald's is responsible for our oldest son's first left turn at a stop light while driving (he made the turn without incident).  That is unlikely to influence your own decision, I just thought I would let you know.
2	For a "fast" food place.. this place is not that fast....  Yes, it's pretty convenient right on Independence on your way out to Matthews... but I rarely have eaten in the dining area and mostly base my experience with this McDonald's with the drive thru.There is rarely a time that I don't drive by and see a line of at least 3 cars deep in the drive through.  Yes, it's a busy location, but even going through it... it seems like it should be a lot faster.My roommate and I always joke and try to predict how long it will take to get thru the drive-thru based on the number of cars in line...  most of our estimates get in the range of going out to a sit-down place.
