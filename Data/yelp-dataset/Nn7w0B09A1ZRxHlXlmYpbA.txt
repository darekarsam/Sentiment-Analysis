5	Dr. Andre Shumway is an expert in his field. I have been looking for a great dentist in Chandler and now I found one. The staff are very friendly and caring.
5	Great dentist that stands behind their work. I had some caps that the Dr. just didn't like how they fit. After a year of watching, he had to do a filling anyway, so he offered to fix them. And at no cost to me. They are always high on my books. If you want a reputable dentist that will take time with you, come here. Oh ya, I'm the biggest chicken when it comes to dentists, even to get my teeth cleaned. They got me over it, so now at least I can get my teeth cleaned. And because they offer sedation, can get any work done that I need.
1	would give ZERO stars if possible...horrible place. dr's are nice, but the staff is full of liars and tell you something is covered pre treatment and bill you something crazy post treatment. don't believe a word they say!!!! unless you are a cash paying patient DO NOT go there if you are billing insurance. they will tell you $75 and bill you $390. STAY AWAY or BE WARNED!
