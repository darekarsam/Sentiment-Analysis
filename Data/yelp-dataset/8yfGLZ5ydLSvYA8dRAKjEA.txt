5	Luckily we booked for Saturday night as it was packed. It's quite a small restaurant, they have booths for bigger groups. Food is so so nice. I went for a meze selection- feta salad (this was my favourite), halloumi with cranberry sauce, a potato salad & baba ghanoush with Iranian bread. All was delish. I also tried the grilled chicken skewer- really nice tender chicken with gentle spicing. You only get one skewer but it's enough, there's about 2 chicken breasts on the whole skewer. Didn't really like the Ariani drink (personal taste) - it's a yoghurt drink with salt. I'd go back just for that feta salad.. Yum. We also took away the baclava and a saffron & cardamom sorbet. Baclava is really nice, quite sticky but I prefer that. Oh and it's BYOB no corkage.
3	This place is quaint and has outdoor seating. The location is right off the royal mile yet walking distance to princes street. Quite perfect for a lunch out while exploring the city.We had the chicken. I had chicken gyro type thing. It wasn't that great. The chicken was cut into small bits and mixed with some kind of sauce. It was all wrapped in a pita with lettuce & tomatoes. But my eating partner had the grilled chicken thighs. Amazing! The sauce was so good and they were grilled really well. Super tasty. We also had a starter. A trio of dips. Hummus, babaganoush and tzaziki. None were really that stand out. Pretty bog standard. I would order again but don't expect amazingness. However, we really liked the bread the dips were served with. It was thicker than pita but not crusty bread. It was quite special.
