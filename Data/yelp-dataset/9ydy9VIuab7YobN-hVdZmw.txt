4	I am impressed with the selections of Olives & Epices inside Marche Jean-Talon.So many different kind of olives oil from around the world. There is also tasting available just need to ask those friendly staffs for some help.On the other side of the store, you can find all kind of herbs/spices and even varieties of whole dried vanilla. I was eyeing the black truffle infused sea salt until I saw all the different type of dried chili they carries even includes Bhut Jolokia chili pepper ($6/10g).I think you can find any herb/spices you need here at Olives & Epices. I wish there is something like this in Toronto as I would be spending hours just to smell everything!
5	Spectacular and unique variety of olive oils and spices from all over the world.  The staff was so friendly and knowledgeable.  I could've spent hours in this shop sniffing and tasting.  What a magical little place!  I think that you can find any kind of spice here! I was able to find my favorite chilies from Korea and Abruzzi!
