4	We ordered home delivery and it took a bit longer than we expected (about 45 minutes). But the food totally solved my craving for Indian for a while. The chicken tikka masala tasted different and sweeter from what I had before but I enjoyed it. The chicken Jhal Frazi was perfect for the spicy tongues. And the Bhonna lamb was just excellent. I would definitely order from them again.
1	Avoid at all costs.Food is bland, over priced and meals don't come with much.Also never eat there. Music was skipping incessantly and the waiter sprayed pink stuff from a windex bottle all around the air in the restaurant when we were sitting there and it was all I could taste the whole time.Really the worst experience ever.
1	Not someplace I will visit again, thought I will give this place a chance inspite of the bad reviews. Summary of my visit:Ambience: 0 - no air conditioning. Coupled with the musty carpet odor.Service: 1 - Owner is also the server. Has no clue about smiling to guests or cust service. The 1 is for the water he finally served after 10 mins. I was the only other table occupied.Food: 0 - BAD!! Felt bad for the pathetic excuse of an Indian cuisine that was being served here to local Canadians. Completely devoid of any taste.Am usually not harsh on any place but this place deserves a commendation for the worst Indian food I ever had. Avoid.
