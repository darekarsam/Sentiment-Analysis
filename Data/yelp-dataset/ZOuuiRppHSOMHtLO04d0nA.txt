5	Amazing food. Their teriyaki chicken is incredible, best I've ever had. They have great prices, are fast and always have chicken samples available if you want to taste it. They also offer dishes with noodles, shrimp and beef. You can get brown rice which is delicious and perfectly cooked and  and sushi. If you want extra teriyaki sauce they will happily put it on which tastes particularly good over the rice. Definitely a place everyone should try!
3	I wouldn't call their food crazy excellent, but man, is it super filling and cheap! Sansei Japan sells Americanized Japanese fast food, it's pretty tasty for the price. First, someone is usually always standing outside and giving out samples of chicken for you to taste. That's usually what hooks me in. Also, they cook everything to order. They cook on a flat top which is open to customers so that they can see the worker prepare the food--pretty nifty! Everything that they serve comes in a "to-go" container, which is useful if you're planning to go home right away after hours of shopping at the mall. In each box, they usually pile on a ton of food, which is great when I am sulking from starvation at the mall! They try to get you your money's worth. There is a small variety of items: beef, chicken..even sushi! Also,  some sort of special is always going on for 4.99 or 5.99!Again, their food's not the best, but we all know that Meadows has just an average food court--but I get so hungry, I never complain!
