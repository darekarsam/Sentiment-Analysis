4	Clean, sells 20 pounds of ice for only $2 for when you need ice, nice workers, fast service, quick drive-thru, separated kids' area, and the whopper tastes great!
3	Nothing to write home about, but worth a shout out on yelp. I went through the drive-thru during the height of lunch hour and was impressed with the expeditious service. The food was on-par with other BK's I've visited. I will return, as this location is conveniently located for a quick jaunt from work. The fries weren't as hot and fresh as I would have liked, but good enough to eat every last one of them.
3	i came in and there was no one at the front. i  hear them laughing in the back. i had to say something before anyone came to take my order.
