5	This bookstore is adorable and beats spending time on Amazon when you can have the pleasure of shopping for unique, used books at great prices. The owner is adorable and will help you with anything. Her passion shines through (as I had the wonderful opportunity to talk with her), and owning a small bookstore is something she cherishes. If you were here before the new owner took over within the past year, than you need to revisit. It's a totally different place. It is now clean, organized, and incredibly affordable.
4	Such a great little local used bookstore! I love this place, and the new owner is very friendly and helpful. If you have children in your life, check out the back of the shop for kids and teens, and there's a range of other great finds all over the shop. From mysteries and potboilers to true crime, history, and chick lit, there's something here for pretty much any kind of reader. The store leans more towards fiction and bestsellers, and is a perfect place to pick up something to read on your way to the T station or Sugar Cafe.
5	The owner was beyond sweet and extremely helpful. I bought a book for my boyfriend, the first Harry Potter, the first hunger games and the last fifty shades so she knocked down the price for me and threw in a free bookmark that I just adored. I found my new spot to get books! I loved her
4	I love spending time in this store. It is enormous and carries just about anything you might want. Item locator kiosks are located throughout the store to help you find specific books, or there is a large and knowledgeable staff on hand to help. Chairs are available throughout the store for you to flip through your books comfortably. During the holiday shopping season this year, they increased the staff and streamlined the checkout process so that I was able to move from the back of a 40 person line to the front in less than 10 minutes. They even offered free gift wrapping!
