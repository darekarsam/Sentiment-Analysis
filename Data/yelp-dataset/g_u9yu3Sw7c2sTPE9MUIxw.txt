5	We were ordering new furniture but wanted to keep a few existing pieces that we love.  The problem we had was - do we order new furniture with the same wood as our existing pieces or have the existing pieces refinished.  If we refinish, how can we be sure we're going to get a good match?  The furniture store recommended Better Than New and advised they work with them all the time.  You can handle the logistics yourself or, for $135 each way, they have a 3rd party take care of it.  The form they had us sign was intimidating, and it did cause us to think twice but we decided to move forward anyway.We received the finished pieces and they absolutely are better than new.  The quality of the work is stunning - minor scratch on one piece is gone and they match our new furniture beautifully.  I can't say enough about the work they did and would highly recommend them to anyone.
