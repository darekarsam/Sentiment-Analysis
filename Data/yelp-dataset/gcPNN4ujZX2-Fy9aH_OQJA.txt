4	I'm surprised this hasn't been reviewed yet.  Oh wait, I shouldn't be...it's in South Side Works.  Between two closed stores....Nonetheless, it's a tiny little gelato shop that totally hit the spot when I was craving something sweet (which is usually always) after dinner.  I ordered the Almond Cookie Crunch in an extra small cup.  No worries about the extra small, it's a nice healthy scoop of gelato.  It filled my sweet cravings for the night (or for a couple hours at least!).  I'm wary on how long it will last with hardly anything down here, plus a Rita's right around the corner....but it has lasted a couple months or a year (?) so maybe other stores will open around it and SS Works will suddenly be revived...all because of a gelato store.  Ok, those are high hopes.  But if you are going to one of the five stores still down there, stop in for a sweet treat!

The gelato here is defiantly fresh, and they let you taste as many different flavors, so you can make sure you make a good dessert decision.  All of the ones I tried were great, but I decided my dessert future to be Caramel.  It was a delicious decision.  However, I wasnt satisfied after devouring my gelato.  I went in for a Crepe with strawberry filling and strawberry gelato with it.  Ohhhh myyy it was good.  It was my first Crepe ever, and it was good.  On a side note it was prepared by a microwave, but it was still completely eaten.Like I said before, this is a great place to grab some dessert, and the best gelato I have had in the area.
4	Nice little gelato place with fresh, creamy gelato.  They're open until 10 PM every day.  The staff are friendly--the girl let us try several flavors (Creme de Mint, Italian Pistachio, Hazelnut, Butter Peach) and gave us baby ice cream cones upside down in our cups.  They also have crepes and coffee here.
