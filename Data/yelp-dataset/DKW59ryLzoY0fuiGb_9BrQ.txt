4	My ace in the hole nail salon and they have remained consistent after years of service and whenever I stray away to test other nail salons, I end up coming right back here every time....so for nails, eyebrow wax and pedicures this is your spot...........they're all about pleasing their clients!
5	Enjoyed my visit to V-Nails for mani and pedi.  The hot stone massage offered as part of the pedicure is very nice.  I do not have to travel as far for my bi-weekly session. Great technician.  Mindy is awesome!  and everyone in the shop that I have talked to is very friendly.  Nice place!
3	Did a great job on my nails BUT they charge  a fee for using a debit card. I'm sorry but that is the cost of doing business- don't charge me. No ma'am! I don't like that at all. Needless to say I paid cash. If I had to pay with debit they wouldn't have received a tip for me.
4	Open on Sunday for limited time. Great experience for pedis..lots of chairs. Went for his n hers pedis and had great time! Will go again!
