1	Not open has fence around it not sure why it is closed down
3	we sometimes come here in the mornings because its close to my wife's Job. there was a fence around it earlier i guess for remodeling but has been taken down....the drive thru is always long in the mornings...so we usually get off and order its much faster than waiting for the cars to pass. we have never dined in at this particular mcdees but the times that we have been there it has been clean.
2	Thirsty. Driving by. Got drink. Found that the Diet Sweet Tea is WAY SWEET. Multiple homeless people lying on curb, seeming to be disoriented. Really not a great location.
