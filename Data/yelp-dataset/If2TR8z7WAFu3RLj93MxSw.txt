5	I lived down the street from this spot and years later, if I am wearing something vintage and unique, it was less than 10 bucks at Local 23. Local artists contribute one of a kind jewelery as well as silk-screened posters, shirts, purses, underwear, ties, etc. The clothes are well choosen, nothing smells or is badly damaged, and its well organized. No bin diving or hidden moth holes here. Bonus: you can take your old clothes there for store credit. I loved seeing people later wearing my circa 2003 value village little boy hoodies. Yes, I knew they were mine, I spill a lot.
4	Gotta love the Local: stylish selections of secondhand stuff and lots of it, crammed into a happy room with zines, eps and other indie publications. Some rocking' local designer and reconstructed stuff is featured, but for the same taste level and almost all local indie designers, check out their sister store down on St Viateur - http://www.yelp.ca/biz/general-54-montreal
