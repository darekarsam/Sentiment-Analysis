4	Splash pad is a must but playgrounds are kid friendly.
5	Beautiful park!!just redone within the past 6 or so years, all the equipment is fairly new! It is kept very clean. There are multiple playground areas that are separated by age range, and while some parents can't seem to read, it is nice knowing my little girl won't be mowed over as she is playing by kids much older than her.There is a nice sized amphitheater, and areas to host party's etc.... with picnic tables.The park matches the town of Stallings nicely......small, clean, not overdone, and welcoming!The only downside is no dogs allowed!!
5	This park is awesome! The splash pad is wonderful for the kids to have fun and cool off during hot summer days. The park also has four different playground areas. One playground is fenced in and safe for young children and there is a smaller play area also for younger kids not fenced in as well. The other two playgrounds are close to one another and have plenty of things the older kids can enjoy. One playground also has a swing that is wheelchair accessible. Also at the park are two covered picnic areas with bathrooms, tennis courts, and a short walking path around the park. The park is also kept very clean. Great place for family fun!
