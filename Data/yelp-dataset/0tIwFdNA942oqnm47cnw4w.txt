3	Located next to the Watthalden Hotel in a historic building, it was a nice place to have a light meal and beer. We ended up here for an early dinner and had the place almost all to ourselves. There is a large courtyard in front of the building that made me wish my visit was in the summer to truly soak up the atmosphere.The indoor space is cozy and broken up into several small rooms. We ended up in the pub section of the building and our service was fine, but not overly attentive. The menu has a mix of soups, salads and entrees, but we ordered one of the tartes, which was a thin-crust pizza. The style of cuisine is a bit muddled with a mix of European and Mediterranean items.While the experience was fine, I'm sure it pales in comparison to the beer garden when it is in full swing. Bookmarked for my next summer visit to Ettlingen.
