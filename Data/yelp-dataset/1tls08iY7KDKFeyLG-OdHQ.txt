5	Best nail salon I think I have ever been to. I have been to a lot all around Charlotte. If your favorite part of a pedicure is the massage this is the place for you. $25 for a pedicure and the massage lasted forever it was awesome. The chairs are super comfy and the massager in the chair actually works...unlike most salons.
4	Probably the best pedicure I've ever had. It was also the least expensive (imagine that!).  The staff is very nice and the salon is located in a great area of town.  You can take care of all your needs (grocery shopping, nice restaurants, etc.) all within a 2-block walk of the salon.
5	This place was great, haven't found service like this since moving from the area. My tech was attentive and wonderful. Outstanding pedicure. After switching from arcylic to shellac I broke a nail, I stopped in and it was fixed for free- with a smile. Go here, you wont regret it ! (stay away from Huntersville location, you will regret it there)
4	I came to this nail salon trying to find a go to salon that is convenient. At first I was worried because it took five minutes for me to be acknowledged after I arrived. However,  to my surprise I met Maria and she was very nice and very delicate. I got a gel manicure and she was gentle with my hands. I will definitely be back.
