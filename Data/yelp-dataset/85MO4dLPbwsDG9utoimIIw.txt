5	I took my wife's car here after being referred here by dealership.  not only did they treat me with professionalism but they treated me like family.  Vehicle fixed quicker then expected. could not even see the repair.  couple months later daughter had accident with her car.  took her car here without a second thought.  They made her car look better then what she started off with.  All I can say is Wow.  and thank you.
1	This business cannot be trusted. They lied to me claiming that they never received an insurance check payable to me for property damage from an insurance company. I just found out that they cashed the check issued to me by falsely claiming that they repaired the car.
5	Everyone at Excel is extremely professional.  I loved getting the photos of the status of my car repair in my email.  Excel took care of EVERYTHING with the insurance company and even helped me get the rental car through the insurance company.  Best of all, they did the repair very timely and even detailed my car!  I highly recommend them.
