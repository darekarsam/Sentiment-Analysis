5	What a great find my dear hubby made today.  The Philly Cheese Steak sub was just melt in your mouth delicious.  I have been to Philly, this is better.   Missy CC made sure my diabetic husband tried the "sugar free" sweet potato pie.  Amazing!!  Will be our new favorite place to eat in Mountain Island area. Janis & Steve.
