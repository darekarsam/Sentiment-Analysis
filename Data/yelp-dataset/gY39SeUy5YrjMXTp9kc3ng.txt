4	This Body Shop location is extremely convenient! I seem to always forget some beauty product when I travel, and if I'm passing through Charlotte, I never worry because I know that the Body Shop is there to rescue me! They carry just about everything the main stores have, and the prices are not inflated due to them being in an airport. My only gripe is the size of the store. It can be hard to navigate with a larger carry on bag. Still worth it, though.
4	I love the body shop!!! It's one of my favorite places and I own almost all of their products! I have tried every scent! I have no complaints the prices are fair and when you find a sale definitely make sure that you stock up! Whenever I am in Charlotte I make sure I stop by this mini shop. It's very small but still has all of the body shop favorites. The staff is also always very helpful.
