1	Champion Window Cleaning just finished cleaning the widows on my home (inside and outside) and I had an awful experience with them.I was quoted $176 for the job by an employee of the company... but when the owner gave me the bill... it was for $216.  He said that he was the owner of the company and that he makes the decisions.  He then asked me "Why would he give me a discount?".  I told him again that it was the price I was quoted by his employee an hour ago when I agreed to have them do the job.I was not happy with how the owner was treating me... and when I wrote him a check he called me a Jew Bastard when walking out the door. I would never recommend this company.
5	Will Champion & his team have cleaned my windows and my neighbors windows in NE Scottsdale many times.  Never a problem,  workers are quick and thorough.  I'll use them again and again.
4	Champion Window has been cleaning my windows twice a year for 12 years.  And yes a couple of times there was a miss because I have many windows but they always came back immediately and made it right.  I don't think you stay with someone for 12 years if they don't do a good job at a fair price...they are in and out without any issue, know me, know my house and get it right.
