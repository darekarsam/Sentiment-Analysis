5	Love it.  Husband and I usually try to pick up some objet d'art as a souvenir whenever we go on vacation.  We're not Rockefellers, tho, so places like Penn Avenue Pottery are perfect: a huge range of pricing -- from reasonable to ridic -- and a nice variety of art.  In this case, ceramics.PAP is an artists' co-op, so the artists share overhead and work hours.  Since Pops is a member of an artists' co-op, I particularly like to support them.  And I was happy to part with my pennies here: husband and I picked up a great little whimsical piece of a moon-faced man to hang on a wall for under 15 bucks.
5	Haven't visited here since c.2005.  But it's a fixture on the strip, and home to talented ceramists.   I keep a cute, terra cotta, moon faced key holder on my wall at home as a cherished souvenir.
5	Local art in the Strip DistrictWe stopped in Penn Avenue Pottery because I'm married to an artist and he loves to support the local arts. He quickly engaged in conversation with the super cool guy behind the counter. They talked about the local art community and the co-op for about 20 minutes.Pottery fascinates me and I've always wanted to try making something myself. Everything on the shelves is made by the artists that run the co-op and the shop. The prices range depending on the size of the item and the intricacy, of course. We ended up purchasing a beautiful blue striped coffee mug that caught our eye, and were happy to know that our purchase helps local Pittsburgh artists. Great little shop in the Strip District!
