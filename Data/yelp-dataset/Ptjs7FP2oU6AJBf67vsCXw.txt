3	The Oasis is Back!  Mark from the Oasis - Heidelberg, which closed a few years ago,  has opened up a little place in Carnegie.  So if you were a fan of the Oasis, here is you chance to have the same homemade sauce and pasta's.   Not all of the pasta is homemade but there is homemade spaghetti, ravioli and, I think, the gnocchi.In a small house with only two booths and one small table.  Ordered take out, so did a few others.  The house has a small porch, with a small sign that is easy to miss.  When you walk up to the porch, go to the double glass doors to enter.  The main door must be for an apartment upstairs; with a sign pointing to the double doors.The food was very good.  Ordered the homemade spaghetti.  The noodles were tasty and al dente with the famous meat sauce that was very good. Dinner includes a salad or soup.  The salad is large with iceberg lettuce, red onions, some tomato, cucumber and green peppers.  Had the Italian dressing, which was OK.   The meal also came with some Cellone's Italian bread, several slices.  We also ordered the Penne Pasta with melted provolone cheese and meat sauce.   The two meals were enough for 4.  The menu has chicken parmesan, fish, eggplant and more.The young lady at the counter was very helpful and very friendly.  Open M-F 11 to 7.  Sat. 12 to 7.email:  oasispastahouse@aol.com
5	The best Fish Sandwich in the area.  Quality homemade pasta, ravioli, and gnocchi.  Looking for a great fish sandwich during Lent give the Little Oasis in Carnegie a call and you will  make this a weekly visit!
5	This family has been making homemade pasta (yes, actual homemade noodles) since my grandparents days when they had a place in Heidleburg.  I am 3/4 italian and this is the only place my grandfather would eat spaghetti outside of his house.  To me, they have the BEST veal parmesan.. ever.
