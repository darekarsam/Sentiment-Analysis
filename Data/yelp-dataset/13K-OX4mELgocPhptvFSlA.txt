5	I am super pleased to have met these guys.  I listened to a recommendation from a long time resident that pointed out to me how long they have been in business......thats important to me.  They  were attentive, answered the phone when I called -even with novice questions to a pro shop, They blew the other guys price out of the water too ( see my review of Strictly Diesel for the numbers on that ).  They are a good bunch of guys here.  I would recommend them to any Diesel Performance Enthusiast ........even if your unfortunate enough to not drive a Cummins.
5	After getting ripped off at Strictly Diesel (complete 6.0 overhaul) these guys replaced the faulty head gaskets installed by Strictly for about half the cost. The did some other work as well for me that was professional and priced fair. I highly recommend using this shop for any diesel repairs. Excellent customer service and fair prices!!!
1	I had pro diesel look at a truck I was thinking about buying as I live 500 miles away and was only going on pics. They found two minor things wrong but over all said it was a good truck.So on their recommendation I flew out to buy the truck. Upon seeing the truck and inspecting it myself, it was a hunk of junk so I flew back home and was out the cost of a round trip flight and their inspection fee. I would never use them to inspect a truck again.
