1	Very sketchy office & no front desk person. The doctor is the only one working. Waiting room is very small.
1	Wednesday around 4 PM. There was no receptionist and I waited 20 minutes, still no one. I left. Don't even bother coming here
1	Office is small it's weird, 80's feel and so is the doctor (Rosen). He kept pacing when we were talking to him before he gave us the paper work to fill out, he was making me nervous! I did not like that he charged me a $2.00 fee to run my visa!! Who does that anymore!?
