5	Miranda Delivery is excellent. They do all receiving and delivery for my design business and they've moved my personal home and office (with zero breakages). The guys are polite, so hard working and accommodating, and the prices are reasonable. Cisco Miranda, the owner, does whatever it takes to deliver top quality service to me and to my clients. I am a dedicated client and happy to offer this positive Yelp review to help him gain even more happy customers.
5	My family recently moved across town. A good friend recommended Miranda Delivery Service. They arrived right on time. There were 4 men working our move. They were courteous and went right to work. They were very quick and handled all my furniture with care. After arriving at my new house we briefly went over where each room was and they placed (and set up) all my furniture and boxes appropriately. Everything arrived in perfect condition including my full length mirror. After the trucks were unloaded we walked the house and rearranged where some furniture was. They didn't leave until everything was where I wanted.
5	I had the opportunity to use Miranda Moving who were referred by one of my fellow realtors. The move could not have gone better! They were on time, very reasonably priced and their crew were very professional. If you are looking for great movers try Miranda-you won't regret it!! Highly recommended!
