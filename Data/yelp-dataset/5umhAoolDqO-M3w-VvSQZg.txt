3	I love my chinese food - so I always jump at the chance to go and review a chinese restaurant. We chose this place because of its excellent happy hour deal; something which seems to be amiss throughout the area's chinese restaurants. However, even without the happy hour deals, I would venture this place is a pretty low budget night out as it is. This is reflected in the quality and taste of the food - its not the best I have ever had, and one of my dining companions questioned what type of meat was in his dish more than once. However, as I mentioned, this place is cheap, and you get what you pay for - something not to great, but filling and cheap.
