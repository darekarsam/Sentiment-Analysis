5	Friendly service and good food. Also it is extremely affordable and just like the title they're the king of chicken. Want some wings? Want some tenders? Want some good local comfort food? Chicken king is definitely a good choice. A hidden gem and a good place to go to.
5	Quick service serving hot fresh food. I had the chicken philly, onion rings and tea. Gt his is a great value and large quantity of food was served.
4	I was surprised by this place. They offer fast food meals with A+ ingredients that's delicious and quick. My intentions was to pick up a takeout order for someone else and ended up with a tasty fish filet sandwich for myself. The menu is stacked with various entrees from burgers, seafood, chicken, desserts and kid's meals. Don't expect healthy (they do serve a variety of salads), just deep fried goodness.
3	Prices are fair but it definitely won't be my new favorite place to go when I come home to visit. The mac and cheese was terrible and I would whether have had GMO filled fake cheese having Kraft before having ever had tasted and ingested there mac and cheese.I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich combo as well and that I can say was their saving grace on this review as it was perfectly seasoned and piping hot and delicious!The customer service was amazing and we were greeted by a friendly voice and they were extremely patient while my husband and I were deciding upon what to order. I would say that this is definitely a place worth trying for the prices you really can't lose.
