5	Grads Photography took my senior portraits and they turned out amazing! All the employees were very helpful and I had an amazing experience. All other studios have crazy prices, but theirs are reasonable, and the prints are worth it! They turned out amazing. :)
1	This company encourages ordering school pictures online, yet they charge shipping and an online ordering convenience fee. Why wouldn't I just order through the school then and avoid those fees? Also, my daughter did retakes and when she tried to give the photographer her original package, he said he didn't need it. When we never received her new school pictures, I called the company and they said it's because they never got her original package back. The person I spoke to about the situation offered no apology for their mistake, and had no interest in helping me. I was truly shocked at how this company treated a customer.  I really wish our school would find another photographer.
