4	A large library with lots of amenities for kids - computers, play areas with little chairs,toys and board books (although I have no idea when/if the toys are cleaned, so I usually come with wipes and/or toys of my own).   What I appreciate most are the story times they offer.  They group them into infant, toddler and preschool story time, and include age-appropriate activities.  I think they also have them in Spanish.  Apparently they have office stuff and books for grown people too.  I think they may have job search seminars and things like that?  Anyway, if this is your local library, check it out.
5	Love this library. I just got my library card so I'm still experiencing the awesomeness of it. So far it has everything I could ever need: computers, study tables, multiple self check out stations, DVDs, copier machines, and books for sale. The staff is helpful. Also, it's extremely family based so the children's section is big and they offer tutoring and other programs for children and teens.
4	Where I spend my lunch hour just to get out of the office. Traffic can be heavy in the afternoon, but worth the drive because of the large selection of books. Despite having laptop and tablets, nothing compares to sitting at home on the couch and stimulating your mind by turning the pages to a book.
5	Large library with plenty of parking. It is also the voting location so be prepared for crowd outside during election season. They have convenient self check out kiosks if you don't want to talk to people and can order books throughout the whole library system.Books on hold or organized on a shelf by circulation so you can nab your selection quickly. The library also has an app for renewing, searching etc.  Hello library of the future.
