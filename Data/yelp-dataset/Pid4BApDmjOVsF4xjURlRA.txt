5	I've tried Barbers all over Glendale, and Najib is by far the best around. This new shop he is working at is really cool as well. It's sports themed with nice TVs and sports decor everywhere. They also have an active duty military discount. You won't be disappointed.
5	I've had about 5 different barbers here, and never once had a bad cut. They all seem to know what they're doing.
4	Found a new place since I came to town and like it. Had to say good bye to my Gal in NJ. Sorry Stacey. Roseanne is my new clipper!
5	What a bunch of really cool guys. Came in on a Sunday afternoon to get my son a cut and they had him looking right for Monday morning. Prices were reasonable and conversations pricesless. These guys are super nice, and makes the kids feel very releaxed. This will be his spot unles we move.
5	This is my neighborhood spot for a haircut and beard trim and they are open Sundays, too, which is a friggin' winner as far as convenience. I could pay half the price at a Hair Cuttery BUT John is a pro and you get what you pay for in this life. So when my $19 razor cut looks as sharp as sh*t,  I know the value of a great barber like John.
5	Love this shop, great group of people and reminds me when I would go to the barber with my grandpa and listen to everybody poke and make fun of each other.  John is the man great sense of humor and a great barber.
