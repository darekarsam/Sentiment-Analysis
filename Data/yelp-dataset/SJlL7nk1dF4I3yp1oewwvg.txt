3	Food was good. Service was pretty quick. Food was inexpensive.  Restaurant had a very fast food feel. Waiter smoking outside of open front was a bit of a bother.
3	Classic drink food. Just Noodles, no frills, open late, cheap as dirt, served super quick in massive heart-stopping portions. I don't know for sure that it's MSG laden, but the hallucinations suggest that yes.
4	Beef pad thai is around 12$. Service is quite fast and food is quite good for this price range. This place is kinda like a fast food but a really good one. I mean I don't think you would want to bring a date there... That s just not that kind of place.
1	Watch out for the rip off. They raise prices at night and charge you way more then you should have. All the bills are done by hand, probably tax evasion too.Plenty of 24h places in montreal, stay away from this one.
4	The food was really good and came in a big portion for the price you pay for. The service was really fast and the place is clean and decent. This is like a better version of thai express!
4	great service polite and just a nice place to be with that special someone 97 choices on the menu sure to please everyone ..
