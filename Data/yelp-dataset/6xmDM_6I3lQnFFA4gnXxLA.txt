4	These folks manage several single family rentals for me in Las Vegas. They have been in LV real estate for many years, and seem to be in touch with the difficult  LV rental market. My statements come in a timely maner. I would recommend them, though communication is a little slow sometimes. I am in no other way associated with them. I am leaving this review to help others, as it was not easy living in a different state, and finding a good prop. manager there.
5	Best deals and houses for rent we have seen yet and great follow up with the staff.
1	My former PM. Currently open investigation with the Nevada Department of Real Estate for inaccurate accounting and money owed to owner.
