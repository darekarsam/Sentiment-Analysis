4	Just like any tech school, you will only learn the basics. Then you have to grow up and learn the trade on the job! Place really gave me a direction of where I want to go in life. Not saying this is the best place to go, it was hard. But life is hard!
4	I'm currently attendingin the HVACR program and it seems good so far but ill keep you updated out ...
1	I'm a u.s. vet ...I finished the school....they are trying to stick me with a large bill because some one who no longer works there messed up the gi bill  paper work ...I would no recommend this school...
1	As I write this Im a student here with a couple months left before Im done. Dont come here. Im a Vet so I used my GI Bill meaning I didnt have to pay to come here for the welding program. Its about 20,000 to come take a 10 month course to learn 4 types of welding. Thats not good. You can go to the Maricopa Skill Center and learn the same thing for 10,000 and thats for a 17 month course. And good luck using your "credits" anywhere else if you come here because its a for profit school. Do your research please. This was just the closest place to my house.
