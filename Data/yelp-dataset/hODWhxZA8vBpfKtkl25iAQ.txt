5	I always enjoy visiting the boys of the straight razor barber shop when I need a hair cut. And gladly drive from central Phoenix to young town just for a cut. The quality of both the cut and customer service is why I will continue to go. Friendly staff, who are also very gifted barbers.
5	This is THE place to go in town for a greaser do. Old school barber shop. You can get a kick *** pompadore with all the grease at a very reasonable price.
5	This barber shop is straight up old school. Rockabilly's and greaser style. Inside they have a lot of cool photos. They sell various known pomades. Price are very reasonable. The location is right off Grand Ave. Parking is small, perfect for small cars. So if you want a straight edge razor cut this is the place. The staff is very cool.
