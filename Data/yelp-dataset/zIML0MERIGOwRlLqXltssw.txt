4	The best Shawarma in Kitchener!  I've had better elsewhere, but if you are looking for Shawarma in Kitchener, this is the place.  There was another Shawarma place here, but frankly I haven not noticed much of a change since the change.Highland Halal Shawarma keeps the menu pretty simple.  Shawarmas are the big draw, but there are also Gyros, Falafels and Fresh Cut Fries.  I am a big fan of the Full Flavour Shawarma, which has pickles, sauce and lots of chicken.  The place is pretty small and it really is only set up for takeout (there are two stools for customers in the whole restaurant, and it can get pretty busy here).

5	Gyros here are to die for.  LOVE IT.
5	Heard about this joint from a friend of mine. I avoided it at first because to be honest, it looks a bit sketchy. I shouldn't have waited. The food's great, cheap, and definitely worth the stop.
5	I have had shawarma in cities all over ontario and Highland Halal is by far the best ive had. The garlic sauce is second to none; I ALWAYS ask for extra. The chicken is so flavourful and there's plenty of it. The gyros are pretty run of the mill, had them once but i think they are just overshadowed by the shawarma.  Falafal is also fantastic. Take out service is fast and friendly, and calling ahead from work and picking up is dangerously convenient. Not an eat-in establishment. Beautiful for what it is. A1!
