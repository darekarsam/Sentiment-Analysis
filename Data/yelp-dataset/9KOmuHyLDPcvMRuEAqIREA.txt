5	Even though I have done my own taxes and taxes for others for many years, we had a special situation come up this year that required a deeper knowledge than I possess. I met with Wanda and really felt comfortable with her assessment of our situation and recommendations. I didn't feel rushed and we sat in her office and discussed the matter until I felt comfortable with our plan. I cannot recommend Wanda highly enough!
5	I've been using Wanda's bookkeeping & tax accounting services for a over 3 years now.  The work is always accurate & timely and she can produce custom reports based on your current business direction, hiring levels, seasonal slowdowns, etc.Having a bookkeeper & tax preparer that's an actual licensed CPA who has to obtain continuing ed credits every year and really knows current laws/trends put me miles ahead of my business competitors.  When some people are just letting business happen, we have the numbers that allow us to plan and use revenue wisely.  How's your business?  Get your books up to date and find out.
5	Wanda O'Malley has been my accountant for several years now. She was recommended by another excellent accountant. I've got to say I feel lucky. She is intelligent, articulate, organized and her fees are equitable. On top of that Wanda has a wonderful warm personality and is a pleasures to work with. I highly recommend Wanda O'Malley!
