4	Fast service, clean restaurant, like most Subways I have been to.$5 foot long is genius marketing and a great deal around the world.
4	Friendly and quick service. In and out. Spacious store. Well put sandwich together and not soggy after I get home with the dressing in it. I will be back though my only gripe is parking is not so easy so you have to park on the street. Yay for Subway's $5 footlong. Fantastic deal and fresh. Can't be beat. I agree with Ronald.
1	Worst subway I've ever been to. Bread is dry ingredients are soggy. Employees do not listen and hate life. A little mayo apparently means one fat greasy soggy line of mayo. Dijon and pepperoncinis apparently doesn't mean anything to them. I almost got buffalo sauce when I said spicy mustard. If you come here pay attention while they make it and be willing to walk away from the grease mountain sandwich when they mess it up.
2	Slow service. I don't think the person making my sandwich could've moved any slower. And, when they spoke to me, they were really quiet and talking to the floor rather than looking at me. Also, how many subways don't have raspberry iced tea? This one doesn't which was a huge disappointment since I normally look forward to that when I go.
