1	This place is cheap but if you are late for your payment they take all your belongings. Thanks for stealing my useless stuff!Avoid this place at all cost.
1	Three billing cycles and all three have been WRONG!  I have had nothing but problems with this place and am moving out.  I was set up that every month they debited my checking account for the monthly fee- however, was assessed LATE FEES (yet they have total control of WHEN they debit my account)- then charged Insurance Fee of $8/month despite faxing and hand carrying over a copy of my insurance declaration page within 48 hrs of renting the unit - they continued to charge me monthly insurance.  I wouldn't TRUST this place ever - there are many other places all over the valley - go elsewhere!
5	Wow best storage unit in town. The staff is super friendly and the area is clean. With the five day grace period, it's easy to pay. I was looking for a 10x10 and they got me one for 89 a month but got half on when I moved in using Sparefoot.com. Thank you Edwards for making me feel welcomed.
