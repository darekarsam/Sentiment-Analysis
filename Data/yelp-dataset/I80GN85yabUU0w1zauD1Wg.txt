5	We are really happy our Realtor has the contacts she does as we really enjoyed our inspection with Toby. He was very thorough and patient and speaks from a place of experience. He quickly identified areas and was able to speak about the options and alternatives available for mending or repairs. Would do business again.
5	Toby did an amazing job with our home inspection. We are first-time home buyers, and were really worried about getting in over our heads. He came out on Sunday of a holiday weekend, which was so helpful! He spent a TON of time in the house, and was super patient with our hundreds of questions. He walked us through the entire house, and explained everything that was going into his report. He even waited at the house well after the inspection was finished for our realtor to arrive, and he went over everything again with her. By that evening, we had a 90-page detailed report, complete with pictures of everything he referred to. Buying a home is nerve-wracking, and he made us feel so much more at ease with our decision. He replies to emails right away, and has been great about answering any other questions we've had. I'm so glad we were referred to him, and would use him again in a heart beat!
