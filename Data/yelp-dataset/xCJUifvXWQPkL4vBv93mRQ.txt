4	Every two weeks I go in for my ritual cut. It is the best. The salon is perfect, clean and friendly. Frankie knows exactly what I want without even having to tell her. I never miss an appointment. She is great and does wonders!!!
5	Just visiting from California and I needed a haircut desperately because cutting it myself didn't turn out as planned haha. She was super sweet, full of energy, and just made me feel comfortable. She had a really good idea, fixed my hack job, and made it look really cute! Can't beat the price or the good company.
4	Only place I go, She's sweet and fun. Makes getting my hair cut easy. Never going anywhere else!
5	I used to bounce around to whoever could fit me into their schedule last minute until I went to Frankie 5 years ago. Since then I've only been getting my hair cut from her. She does a great job every time and is always in a good mood. 5 stars from me.
5	She's good. Knows her products. Super friendly and funny. She does as you ask but also gives great advice. She's been doing my hair for years. Wouldn't go anywhere else if I hadn't moved out of state!
