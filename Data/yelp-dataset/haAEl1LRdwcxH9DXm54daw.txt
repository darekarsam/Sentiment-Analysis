3	This place is clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. But quite possibly the WORST spray tan I have ever received. I spray tan often and normally would go to ProTan which was bought out by Palm Beach Tan. Well I looked streaky and orange. It was awful, I spent the next 3 days scrubbing my skin of the horrible color. AND they want to charge $55 for a spray tan. Do yourself a favor and go buy a bottle of Jergens and save yourself the money. Their product is clearly cheap. Definitely will not be back.
2	NEVER come here if you don't have the time to stay at least 40 minutes! Both times I've come in on my 3 tan pass, outs been a complete cluster. Only reason I gave 2 stars is because as ridiculously slow as they are, the staff is friendly. Considering not even using the third tan on my pass at this point though!
4	I have been using this location for years before it was bought out by Palm Beach Tan. I gave it 4 stars because in comparison to other salons it is one of the better ones. I really miss the company this location was before. Palm Beach Tan is reasonable for their rates and plans. But, I don't like how they nickel and dime you for upgrades. If you want to upgrade you shouldn't be charged extra. Oh well, that is costing them money now because I won't pay to upgrade. Overall the staff is friendly and the facility is clean. They open at 8 am Monday through Saturday and before the previous company opened at 7 am. I used to be able to tan early in the morning on my way home from the gym and now I can't do that anymore. My main complaint would be that they opened at 7 am instead of 8 am. Overall, I recommend Palm Beach Tan for its cleanliness, staff and location.
