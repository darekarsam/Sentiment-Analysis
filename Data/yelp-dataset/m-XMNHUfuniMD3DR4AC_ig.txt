3	So here's how it goes...hubs and I have put off framing a sizable Thomas Kinkade print for a long time. Like three years long. We finally took this gorgeous print out of hiding and took it to Fastframe, purchased Yelp deal in hand. Well, errr, in phone.The woman who works here is super informed on the framing goods - matte colors, double mattes, types of framing, etc. She's busy yet friendly and definitely guides your choices. And this little shop is filled with options. So many options! Because of this, it took us a little while to come to our decision on colors and frame type. But we got it done!And then it came time to redeem the Yelp deal and pay. The redemption went fine, even though it seemed like they're running a plethora of deals and it was hard to keep track. The final price was much more than I expected, but I'm no framing connoisseur. I personally like to use those dollars by way of clothing! At the end of the day, the print looks great. It was well done and nicely put together. Would I have liked to pay less? Sure. Would I have another print or painting framed here? Sure!
4	They did a good job with the framing of my diploma.  A little expensive compared to what I had done in Florida, but not completely unreasonable.
4	This place is a great frame place!  I got some custom work done here, and it was done super well!  It is a little pricey, but I was a very important piece, so it made it well worth it!
