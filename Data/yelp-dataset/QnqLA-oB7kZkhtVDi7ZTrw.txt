5	FULL DISCLOSURE: I sometimes volunteer at this location.I've seen the faces of people who visit animal shelters to adopt. They're upset by the loud barking, saddened by the stressed animals and turned off by the prison-like setting.And that's why Petmatch is so important. It looks like a pet store. Each animal has a comfortable space. The dogs are walked regularly. The staff is friendly. The facilities are clean, and they entire storefront is welcoming.I hope more shelters and rescue groups follow the revolutionary example set by Petmatch.
