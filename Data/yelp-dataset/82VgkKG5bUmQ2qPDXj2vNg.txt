5	The staff r nice and its a quick way to earn $ the only thing i hate is getting stuck by a needle lol
1	It's not quick never quick, in the beginning the staff are rude and don't care but after awhile of seeing your face they open up and even recognize your voice over the phone. The place is too small and they need more works, beds, and equipment.
1	We went there 9 years ago and were deferred because we had just moved to the Valley and were living in a studio. They stated that we didn't have a 'real' address (?) We were renting a studio down the street and wanted to take our time to get to know the area. We bought a house a few months later. Fast forward NINE YEARS LATER. We try to donate again and are deferred AGAIN because of the past issue. Even though we have our home address on our AZ driver's license, they demanded that we provide 2 pieces of mail no older than 7 days old. Fine. Came back 2 days later at 6:30 am and they were having a 'monthly meeting' and would not be open until 9 am. ( REALLY ???? How is it that other Plasma Centers are able to function just fine by having their meetings AFTER closing ???) Then today we tried on last time. We are told that they have no other 'appointments' available !!! It was 7:05 in the morning !!! CSL may not pay as much but they are FAR more professional, not nearly as disorganized, MUCH cleaner, and have a better trained staff. We will NEVER go back to "BIOHAZARD" ever again !!!!!!!!!!
