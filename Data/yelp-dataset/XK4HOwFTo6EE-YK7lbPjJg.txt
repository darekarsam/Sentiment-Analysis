2	This Dunkin kinda sorta replaced the old one over on Liberty Avenue.  Good thing too, 'cos that one was kind of a dump.  Dunkin's donuts are okay, but face it.  The only reason I ever come in here is to get the coffee.  Dunkin has bulk coffee and I actually like that better.
4	I usually dont review chains but I give credit to the ones who do a good job and rip the ones who are horrible. I stopped in for coffee and doughnuts early morning on New Years eve. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful . Everyone wished me Happy New Year before I left the register. I appreciated that.
5	I love the coffee at DD. Its Fresh and hot every time
4	American runs on Dunkin' Donuts! Ha.
2	donut was good but the coffee isn't that great. it was so hot it burned my tongue and tasted like cheap dinner coffee. not sure what all the fuss is about. i'll take starbux any day!
4	After living on DD coffee and donuts for a decade in New England, I was disappointed to find very few locations in the Burgh! However this one in Market Square is plenty good. It can get crowded in the mornings when there is a lot of office rush or maybe on the weekends but the staff get the people moving pretty quick. Being decently sized, this location offers some seating space (however DD is not much of a sit down coffee joint). I stick with the regular coffee (hot) or the iced coffee. The Vanilla Chai has usually been good but lacks consistency in its making. As this is a chain, I am not going to get into details on the food items but don't forget your munchkins/donuts if you are from California. Also you can get your K-Cups from this place and use your DD app to pay for purchases. I do believe they have free wifi but never really used it.Parking is a pain, being Market Square, but I will roll with the punches as I continue to "run on DD."
