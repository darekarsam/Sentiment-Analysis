4	this is not your regular cookies boutique. this is a shortbread heaven or what i like to call them, the fancy cookies because, while good on their own, they shine best when paired with tea, hot cider or a glass of porto or maybe some bubbly too.these are the cookies you entertain adults with.about the place: it's more of a kitchen with a counter than the other way (if you look at the boutique/kitchen space ratio)about the cookies: everything is made by hand, right in the kitchen which guarantees you of a fresh daily batch. on the left, you'll find cookies made entirely with butter (less expensive) while on the right, it's entirely olive oil. flavor wise, it's a combination of ingredients like chocolate-pear, orange-chocolate, chocolate-lemon, pistachio, caramel, etc.the flavor combinations work and you can taste each component individually. and the shortbread is what you'd expect of a good shortbread: crumbly but not dry.if you love shortbread, what are you waiting for?as for me, i prefer the softer chewy cookies but if i want to impress some girl's parents or looking for some christmas present, i'd definitely consider this charming tiny boutique
