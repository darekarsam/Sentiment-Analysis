5	Huge selection of tasty treats, friendly staff and will cost you half go what you'd pay at the grocer. I grab day old onion buns and roast beef every time I go.

They have a huge assortment of delicious baked goods, along with a couple fridges where you can get butter, cheese, milk, massive jars of pickles, sandwich meats, etc. You can get day old products for a reduced price which is wonderful. I can get a loaf of bread and six bagels for $3. I'm never getting grocery store bread again.
