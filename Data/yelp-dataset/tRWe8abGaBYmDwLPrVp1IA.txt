4	Since I am writing reviews for cab companies now...I will write about the best cab company in the city.  Unfortunately, they will not pick you up from outside Montreal, but if possible I would use these guys first.The drivers are always courteous, they do not fuss, complain, or fight me when I use my credit card, (unlike MOST other cab drivers in Montreal I've used).  They take me the quickest way, even though I probably seem like a tourist when I am downtown.I use this company a few times a Month and would highly recommend them.
1	For picks up on the street Atlas is your best bet drivers are kind and polite IF you know where you are going. I wouldn't bother calling the dispatch for a cab if you are visiting and are calling from a non local number- dispatch can't contact you and cabbies won't ring their fares once they arrive at their destination. Ymmv
4	Clean cars, and courteous drivers.  Other companies I used have horrible smelling cabs, whether it be heavily ladened with cigarette smoke, 15 "air fresheners" (I did count that amount in one car and almost died of inhalation),; rude drivers; After some research I found Atlas, they are great!
1	I really had a bad service today with Atlas, after 1.5 years of being loyal to the company. The cab driver charged me 10 dollars more because he said I was moving when I wasn't. I was carrying my bags to my boyfriend's house because we are travelling tomorrow. Of course I was going to call Atlas to go to the airport but now I just changed to Diamond. The driver was condesending when I asked him to take a different route, saying he knew Montreal better than me. I was so angry that I didn't even let  the driver touch my things. I practically gave him a $10 tip for nothing. This is what you get for loyalty. Zero appreciation in return. And this is how you lose customers.
2	The cabs and the drivers are great but the call operators are some of the rudest people I have ever encountered in my life. Seriously need to work on this
