5	I was a first time customer at Handel on Monday, January 30th. Bill, Laurie and Darryl were very welcoming and easy to talk to. They never made me feel like I didn't know what I was talking about. I had gotten home that day to get ready for work, and my car was acting up. I called them on Tuesday to let them know about the problem, and I was unable to get my vehicle to them that day and I was planning on taking it in on Wednesday. Laurie called me back and told me that they were going to pick my vehicle up at my house and bring a loaner car for me to use. That way they could take a look at my car while I was at work. They went above and beyond to make me happy. At this point I am not really worried about the price, I am just so thankful that they are willing to do that for me!!!

Bill was very helpful and they were quick to determine what the issue was with the engine.(which I think had been previously misdiagnosed at another establishment) I would recommend taking your car to Bill and the Handel team in a heartbeat!
5	I just had my first experience with Handel Automotive. Bill, the service manager, was great with customer service, had a sense of humor and was very attentive to me describing the problems. Also, as a woman, he treated me with respect which was a refreshing change from the norm. He also went out of his way to print off an online coupon that saved me $10! I'll definitely be referring people here! Their pricing was great and the service was excellent.
