5	We moved into our new house and only had one key and the kids lost it!! I called JT's at 6pm and Jeremiah answered the phone and said he would come right over! Which was amazing and he was the nicest guy you could ask for he changed all of our door locks and reinstalled them within the hour!! I called six lock smoths this day and NONE of them called me back and  Jeremiah not only answered he came right over! AMAZING SERVICE!!! Would call in a second if I needed new keys made!! THANKS
5	Locked the keys in our car at 9pm on a Sunday night.  I called a couple different locksmith services that popped up in a google search but they turned me off because they routed me through call centers...  After reading a couple positive reviews for JT's, I called and was pleased to speak with him directly.  Within a few minutes, he was at my house and quickly had my keys in my hand. Very professional and helpful -  highly recommend.
5	I had a problem with my postal box - someone must've mistakenly tried to open it and broke their key - leaving part of it in the lock. I called Johnny on Saturday morning, met him at the box 5 minutes later, and he replaced it. Excellent, cordial, and reasonable service. I will use JT for all key and lock issues. Highly recommended.
