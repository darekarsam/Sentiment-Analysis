1	I'm not sure about the work the doctors do here but the front desk/receptionist is as rude as they come. I was extremely ill and she had no concern for that. Long story short after trying to take money from me before I was even seen (without giving me any idea of how much my visit might cost) I decided to leave. Also - as we sat there for over an hr waiting for our appointment we noticed people coming in and being seen even though I was there before. They had a little note saying that patients will be seen in order of apt time - not arrival. So I'm confused as to why people arriving for 2PM apts were seen before me that had a 1PM apt. With the unprofessional behavior and attitude I received from the front desk I'd suggest avoiding this establishment. I wouldn't feel comfortable having any type of private or medical info handled by people in this office.
1	Worst doctors office ever. Be prepared for a long wait even if you arrive on time for your appointment. I arrived at 1:00 and was seen at 3 pm ridiculous. The front desk doesn't seem to know what they're doing and are very rude and they are very disorganized I don't recommend anyone visit here.
