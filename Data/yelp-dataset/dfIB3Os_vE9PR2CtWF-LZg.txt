5	I've used Waiter's Choice for dozens of catering jobs. Mostly corporate lunches at work for 10 to 120 people. I have used their white tablecloth formal setup as well as their express style service. Most recently they catered breakfast  2 days last week and lunch 3 days last week each for 20 people. each delivery was perfectly on time, and exactly what I ordered. They are always professional and the food is great. in the last week alone, I have eaten their fried chicken, beef brisket, pulled pork, sausage, egg and cheese croissant sandwiches, cookies, brownies and a variety of sides. Keep up the good work, we need more place like Waiter's Choice that understand how to manage good food and fantastic customer service at reasonable prices.
5	WC catered our Thanksgiving office party and did a nice ob. We ordered a traditional turkey and trimmings meal. Everything tasted delicious. The turkey was not dry as it sometimes can be, and I was a big fan of their mashed-potatoes and tea (I mix sweet & unsweet together). High marks for a great job!
