4	Great products, smells heavenly when you walk by.I've received their hand creams, a cult classic free of charge, thanks to Facebook promotions they were having. When visiting their store to pick up the free gift, I had a chance to look around and try some other products. Everything is quite lovely, all kinds of high end products for the body blended with natural extracts and premium ingredients. Shea butter is prominent in much of their creams, either for hands, face or body.I've received some soaps, body wash and creams as a gift and sales person even included additional samples.It's not a busy store so the moment you walk in, all eyes and attention on you.You will be treated very well, even if you aren't buying anything.Just wish they had more sales, prices are rather high!
