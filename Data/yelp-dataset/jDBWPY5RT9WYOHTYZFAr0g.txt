5	I love quiktrip! I stop here frequently on my way to work because in the mornings it's one of the few places I can get lunch food quickly and cheaply before 10 o'clock in the morning. The service is always super fast, the staff is always  friendly, and there are tons of gas pumps if you actually need gas. They have a great selection of hot foods on the roller bar, cold drink bar, and coffee station. They have a large variety of snacks and candies. It really is one stop shopping, even for your late night munchies! This is hands down my favorite gas station and convenience store in the greater Phoenix area!
5	Love me some QT...clean,  actually decent food.  Highly recommended a rooster booster!!!
4	By far one of the better qt's. Always fast and friendly staff.  Bathrooms are kept clean. I also like the fact that the gas is less expensive than most others.
