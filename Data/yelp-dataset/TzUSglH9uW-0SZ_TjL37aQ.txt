3	It's a teen accessory store, but it was the closest thing around the house and I'm in a pinch for body jewelry. My tongue ring ball fell off and I didn't have extras at home. I could see the white new tissue forming  so I had to get something. Here, they have cheap sets of bars and also just packs of ball replacements. Not all the designs in the packs were cute, but for $12 for 2 bars and like 8 ball designs, it's not bad at all.

Plus, nearly half the amount I have bought ended up being curved or broken, so I couldn't use them (they usually would just fall out of my ear).  This is what all their products are like, in the end. Everything is cheaply made, and over priced. The only reason I gave them three stars is because of the nail polish. I love nail polish. I love colors. They have bright colors, dark colors, sparkles, and glow in the dark ones- this, and this alone is why I gave them three and not two. It's the only thing I will go there for, unless I am buying a young girl her first makeup bag or something like that.
