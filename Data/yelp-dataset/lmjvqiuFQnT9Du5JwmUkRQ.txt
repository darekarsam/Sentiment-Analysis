5	I love this place! I've eaten here more times than I can count and everything (including the chicken sandwich) is amazing. you won't be disappointed!
5	We had driven by this place many times but never stopped for a bite. Until last night. And since then I have been asking myself why I didn't stop here earlier.Sure, I'll be honest, the outside looks sketchy. In fact, I wouldn't recommend anyone to go here alone after dark, especially if you are a girl. But at the same time, I'll say you definitely SHOULD go here because this is such a diamond we found in the coal!When we got here, I asked the owner what was good. He recommended the house special double cheeseburger, which my boyfriend got, and absolutely loved. I didn't see a po' boy sandwich on the menu but was in the mood for one so asked the owner and he said they could make me one. And I was glad they did. It was delicious! I can't wait to go back here and try some more stuff on their menu. Although they call themselves "Chicken King," they have seafood, beef, lamb and pork as well.Tip: Minimum purchase of $5 required for credit cards.
5	Every time I come here I am never disappointed. The food is great, the service is speedy, the woman can be a bit rude; however due to the neighborhood I can understand her sour attitude. If you can by pass her attitude, the location, the view of the building, it is in fact a diamond in the rough. I love it!
4	That makes me hungry and each time I drive by that restaurant I begin to drool like a dog
