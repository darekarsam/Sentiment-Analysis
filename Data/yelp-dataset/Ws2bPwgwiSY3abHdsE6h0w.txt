4	Wow, this place is fantastic!  A work colleague took me here and I can say this place is excellent for both quick service and a great place for a power carb lunch!  Basically, like the name mentions it's all about pasta goodness!  Behind the counter a chef asks you what ingredients you like (mine had shrimp, black olive, sausage, mushroom, green pepper, garlic) and then you choose from 4 different pasta's and your preference for sauce (white, rose or meat/tomato).  I chose the rose!  Also they ask if you would like a splash of white wine for some extra flavour.  I said what the hell as it was Friday today!  They also give you bread and a garlic oil dipping sauce on the table (I avoided due to afternoon business meetings!).  All in it was under $10 with tax!  Seriously amazing value!  Especially in this day and age when a lunch at Carrefour Laval food court will easily cost you $12 - $13!  Probably one of the best value resto's in Laval or a great place to eat if you are running a marathon tomorrow!

I got shrimp, sausage, garlic, onions, and mushrooms in my pasta with rose sauce. I had never been here before and I didn't know exactly how everything worked, but they were very patient with me and suggested various ways to put my meal together. It was absolutely delicious and filled me up! The meals were about $11-$12/person, which is completely reasonable for the quick helpful service and the huge portions. Love this place and can't wait to go back!
