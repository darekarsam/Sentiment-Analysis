1	DO NOT USE Image 2000.  They have the WORST service.  If you call their office number and schedule and appointment for a technician to come out and take a look at your printer, they may or may not show up and when they do show up, they can't fix the problem and tells you that they will do some more research and get back to you with a solution in couple of days...YOU ARE LEFT HANGING...NO CALL BACKS...NO FOLLOW UPS.  When you do call the office number it goes straight to voicemail, leave them a message and they DON'T BOTHER to return your call...GOING ON ALMOST 2 WEEKS NOW.  DO NOT EVER USE THEM.  THEY ARE HORRIBLE!!!!
1	I want to give no stars, but it wont let me.  DO NOT use them, for anything. WORST customer service, RUDE sales people and just not professional.  When our lease was up (on one of the worst copy machines we have ever had) Mike called us and tried to get us into a new machine, we told them no thank you, we did not plan to renew and wanted to get a different copier brand that they don't sell.  Just asked them to come pick up the machine and they said, "sorry your lease renewed for a year,  You have to pay a fee.  Good Luck."  I am floored.  I have learned in the business community you don't burn bridges even if you lose a client, but they don't seem to care.  STAY AWAY!!  We moved to Elan Office, so much better.
1	I inadvertently crossed paths with one of the managers at Image 2000 and when the brand name Xerox was mentioned (which Image 2000 does not sell), he became incredibly rude and defensive.  It was amusing to watch a 50-something man start acting like an insecure little junior high school girl who was just told that her rival asked her boyfriend out.  He became so irate at the mention of the name Xerox that it was obvious that he's lost a lot of business to them.  His demeanor alone would certainly drive me away.
