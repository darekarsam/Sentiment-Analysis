2	Tiny RV park new Tempe, with a crotchety old owner who's actually really nice. RV parks are always defined by their price and their "amenities". The price is fair, but the "amenities" are nearly non-existant. Yes there's a bathroom, but it was the worst bathroom and shower that I've experienced traveling the country. Water just got everywhere, and there was no way to hang a towel or anything. Plus there was no plug in you needed to shave or dry your hair or anything. It's also not exactly where google maps says that it's located, so it's a bit difficult to find.
4	Great location at the end of the line of the light rail.  Acrss the street from the Mekong plaza with great restaurants and a huge Asian supermarket.  Safeway and Wahlgreens are within walking distance.  Great wifi reception.
5	The best RV park love outside the pool area Harold the Owner is the best part of the whole park who cares about amenities when you have this guy at the Helm you can go anyplace. In life we meet unforgettable Landmarks and this Man Harold is class act all the way.
