4	It's like a Farmers Market on steroids.Tons of food vendors and people hawking their homemade goods and crafts. I have to be honest and I wasn't able to try most of things here, but I did partake in the "Green Juice Bar", "JoJo's Jerky", and the fresh squeezed lemonade stand. The juice was very good and gave me that much needed boost of energy when there was no coffee to be found, even though it was a little pricey. JoJo's Jerky was delicious as per usual, and you can't go wrong with fresh strawberry lemonade made right in front of you.Then there was the pie eating contest. An insanity laiden event with fifteen people eating blackberry pie with no hands, faces only. It was really quite a scene. Why enter this crazy pie eating situation, how about for a $100 cash prize. Yup, and the reigning champ ended up winning, 3 years strong. One whole pie in under 20 minutes. Great stuff for the both foodie and and craft lover inside of you.
