5	John was great.  Appointment scheduled for the very next day.  Priced exactly as originally quoted price on the phone.  Door works better now than when the house was brand new.  Great job!!
5	John was awesome, very helpful, friendly and honest. Came out the next day. Affordable pricing, nothing shady. Thought my door was beyond repair, he literally brought it back to life. Would recommend to anyone who has a problem and thinks there is no hope.
5	There is nothing more to say than outstanding. John was on time, provided a quote and was able to schedule the job the very next day.  Three hours later (after a trip to the hardware store for an unforeseen issue) the job was done on my thirty year old sliders for the price quoted.  John could have charged more, but he kept with the original estimate.   Don't hesitate - pick up the phone and dial.  John provided incredible at a great price.
