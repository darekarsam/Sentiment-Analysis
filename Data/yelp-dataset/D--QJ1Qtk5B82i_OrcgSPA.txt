3	It's my neighborhood Walgreens....always clean, very friendly sales people that greet you and get to know you and make you always feel welcome to be there.  Sales staff will go out of their way to help you, which is really nice, although there is never anyone available at the photo counter and sometimes it takes a bit of waiting.  Pharmacy is efficient and always professional.  I notice a difference in this Walgreens, compared to others I've stopped in.  It's a lot more welcoming.
