1	Well we went here instead of sunset station buffet. The dinner price went up to 12 dollars. And I remember this place being packed even with the casino buffet across the street. Well the quality of the food is ok. It used to be better. The sushi was fresh. Didn't have Mongolian off the grill this time but previous visits it was good. I guess it's called lucky star out front but Yelp pulls up China star buffet.The ice cream machine was out of order. The fried rice and chow mein was on Saran wrap in the hot tray. The chicken skewers were decent. Same with the broccoli beef and orange and sesame chicken. Nothing stood out and was memorable. The donuts had been out forever and were hard as a rock. I'm surprised its still hanging on. I'd pass on this one.
4	The people there are very accomadating.  I asked for a specail sauce and they made it for me without hesitation.  I enjoy the jalepeno chicken, chicken wings, sfuffed shrimp, fried rice, soup (hot and sour) fish.  They add fried shrimp and so other dishes on Sat. & Sun but charge a little more.  If you tell the people what you want, they will happily do their best to get it to you.  I think this place deserves to be given a try.  The desert bar is decent and they give you a card for a free meal after 10 visits, that's like a dollar off each meal.
3	A nice place for lunch, reasonable prices, nice atmosphere, and good hospitality.
