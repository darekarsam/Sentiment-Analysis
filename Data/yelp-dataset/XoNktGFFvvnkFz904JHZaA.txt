3	I know, I know...I said I wasn't going to deal with another Petsmart, but alas, I entered into this one today.I am still on the hunt for a new leash for Milo (I'm so picky!) & since I was in the area, I came into this particular one, across from Northlake Mall.  Upon entering, I was cheerfully greeted by an employee. The store layout is really nice, the lighting is bright, & the store itself was clean (& smelled clean).I was very pleased to see that several choices of leashes offered a nice discount with a Pets Perk card (Petsmart's rewards program).  However,  I was a bit disappointed to see many of the packages were damaged and opened. This location offers the grooming salon, as well as the Banfield Veterinary service.
2	We used to take our dogs to the Petsmart in California to get the nail grinding done so we figured this would be an okay option here. Well, so not impressed. The groomer tried to hold my littlest chihuahua with one hand and use the grinder at the same time which they never did. They normally had one person hold him while the other person held the paw and did the grinding. This resulted in him getting his paw chewed up on the front and the back  (both were bleeding) and the groomer missed 3 claws after all that!So now I have a dog who won't leave a cut alone and I STILL have to take him to get those other three claws done somewhere! Can't believe I paid full price for this. So annoyed and I WILL NOT be back!
