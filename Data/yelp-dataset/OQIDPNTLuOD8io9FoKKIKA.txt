5	Great tasting food. I would definitely recommend this place!
1	I ordered delivery from here last night. It took nearly 90 minutes and they forgot one of the items I ordered. They did deliver the vegetable dumplings, which were soggy and coming apart. They delivered the hot and sour soup that was so over salted as to be inedible, I had to dump it out after a couple bites. They did deliver the Szechuan chicken with white rice, but the rice was significantly over cooked and the chicken was at best mediocre. Needless to say, my first experience with Auntie Lee will be my last.
1	Ordered twice here and everything was not authentic and tooooooo salty.Avoid the place even you have nothing to eat at midnight.
3	I ordered delivery, and had to wait more than an hour for the food to arrive. Apparently the driver was lost.The food is average.
