5	I had my first adjustment ever done at Kerch Chiropratic and Kim Kerch was able to make me a patient for life.
5	Dr Kim is really a top-notch doc. She adjusts like an angel with delicate, but strong hands, and her staff is really nice! I wish I lived here so I could get adjusted every week at this office. I have referred several patients to her with full confidence in her ability to keep them in optimal health.
5	I got adjusted by Dr. Kim last weekend when visiting the Phoenix area on vacation. She was very professional, kind, and a great chiropractor! I highly recommend Kerch Chiropractic to anyone in the greater Phoenix area seeking better health. The adjustment made my trip back to Santa Barbara much more comfortable and I plan on visiting Kerch Chiropractic the next time I am in town. Thank you, Dr. Kim.
