4	This place totally held it's own.  After living in Los Angeles, I can say for sure I can tell the difference between good and bad Mexican food.  This place is really legit.  The refried beans were excellent.
5	Great mexican food I stumbled upon while staying nearby on a trip.This has to be the best place in Charlotte for Mexican food beacuse, in my opinion, Charlotte is a dump occupied by slightly successful, ill-educated hillbillies.Hope this helps.
3	Like K.B. said, its pretty standard mexican food.  I thought the salsa before the meal was too watery.  I had the fish tacos.  The fish was fried.  This place is ok if your in the area and hungry.  You won't be thrilled or disappointed.
4	I have been frequenting Zapata's for years and I love it! My favorite is the street tacos which are always fresh and delicious. I have never been disappointed with my food at Zapata's and I know many people who are patrons as well. It is a really large restaurant so there is always seating available. The service is always great. I can't say enough good things about it. I am a big fan of Mexican food and I have tried a lot, let me tell you this place won't disappoint.
4	Good nice Mexican ambience and food...
4	This is a great local Mexican joint..  modern priced, comfortable, good ritas and sangria and standard Mexican food done California style. I am from Los Angeles and there are a million of these sort of places here, so it was nice to have a local Mex place that was casual, consistently good, friendly, laid back and fun.My faves are Tortilla Soup & Street Tacos.. I have also heard that they turn it into a Spanish club on the weekends, which is awesome.
2	I haven't been back here in years. The food is mediocre at best. Head to Monterrey's.
4	Decent food, good drink specials and real fish tacos! Similar to other Spanish restaurants, they have Taco Tuesdays and Margarita Mondays I think? It might be Friday actually....I'll get back to you on that. I normally go through two baskets of chips and three cups of salsa all by my lonesome. That's a good sign. The rice and beans are always consistently well made. Enchiladas are okay, but street tacos are a yessir. While they offer authentic beer battered Baja style fish tacos on either flour or corn tortillas, they sometimes lack flavor. A little sprinkle of salt will solve that problem! Substitute corn over flour tortillas and you will have an epiphany. Cheers to corn tortillas!
4	This place serves Mexican with a Spanish bent. I've been here for dinner dozens of times over the years, and finally realized I ought to review it. We stopped in last night after a 49ers Men's soccer match (beat Elon, 1-0). My son wanted to go to Dish, but Plaza Midwood is 20 minutes away at best, and it was 9:00 PM. "Whaddaya want, Trev?" "Nachos!" Well, he wasn't disappointed, even if he didn't get to pick the 'rant. They started us off with their usual never-see-the-bottom trays of chips and salsa. You really do have to be careful with these, because you can ruin your appetite for dinner by filling up on warm, crunchy tortilla chips and hot, complexly flavored salsas!Restraint was worth it.I had a wonderful Pollo Asado Burrito (very healthy chicken and veggies with a tomatillo sauce over it all). My wife had the La Union Chimichanga, which she loved. Portion sizes were HUGE, so we ate lunch off of our dinners the next day. The boys got what they wanted. My "all American twin" got his usual chicken fingers and fries, and his brother got a taco, rice, and beans.They have decent draft beer, and various daily drink specials, so if you're thirsty for relaxation, get something from the bar.This is probably my second or third favorite Mexican restaurant in town. We go here, because it is close to us. I love Cantina 1511 on East Blvd, and Las Margarita on Independence near Sharon Amity, too.That said, this place is flavorful, consistent, and the service is great. They also have some interesting and colorful decor. Occasionally, they'll add live entertainment, too. Check out their online menu at:http://www.zapatasrestaurant.com/
2	I have yet to find a dish I like there. I feel like there are better places for Mexican besides here. Food was mediocre I thought.
2	My new coworkers invited me to go get "cheap mexican" with them for lunch. Now, from where I work, you could walk to more skeevy, run down looking, hole in the wall mexican joints than you can count on a hand, and I'm pretty sure at least a few of them would be absolutely delicious (as hole in the wall restaurants tend to be). Unfortunately, I can not report on any of them, because we drove by them and went to Zapatas.I won't say that Zapata's was bad, partially because i don't think it is deserved and partially because it feels like I am giving credit for more effort than they earned. While the salsa that came with our gratis basket of chips was full of cilantro and onion flavor, that was the high point of the meal. We ate off the lunch menu, and I went with the enchilada and taco plate. The meat in both was slightly greasy and not particularly flavorful. The taco shell tasted like it was pulled out of the grocery store box on my pantry shelf. The rice was bland and slightly overcooked. I do have to give them credit for the enchilada sauce being kinda tasty, but nothing I wouldn't expect from a jarred sauce. The low point was definitely the refried beans, which are often my favorite part. I took one mouthful, found them utterly disgusting and left the rest of them on my plate to form a sad, cold congealed mess.I have often thought that quality service can redeem an otherwise forgettable meal, well in that case creepy, unpleasant service can cement a bad impression. Despite our party of three being one of less than a handful of patrons in his section, our waiter was slow to get to our table even after being called over. He gave off a used car salesman type of aura and loses additional point for trying to talk me into drinking tequila on my lunch break.The only reason I can imagine returning to Zapata's would be at my coworkers request, and even then I might think about sticking with the tuna sandwich I brought from home. Oh, and as for that "cheap" bit. The lunch pricing is in the 6-10 dollar range, which isn't particularly remarkable when there are tacos to be found for under 2 bucks.
4	I like Zapata's! The decor is "Mexicany" without being cheezy and my Garden Burrito was delicious. The warm red sauce they served with the burrito was smoky and yummy!
4	Very nice Mexican/Spanish food. I will drive 45 minutes into University to eat here. Service is always attentive. Patio and inside seating are nice. Very family friendly, although I don't have small children anymore. I am struck by the numbers of Latino patrons, and I think that attests to the quality of the food here. If you know the real deal, you don't patronize a crappy representation!I especially love the rice and beans, the cheeses (and the generous amount of cheeses!!!) and the beer. Did I mention the chicken dishes are all quite good. Have not tried the beef and fish entrees- yet.
4	I was pleasantly surprised by this place after going here for lunch.  For some reason I thought Zapatas was "upscale" mexican (with upscale pricing) but I was totally wrong.  I think this is due to the fact that the only other location I know of is in Ballantyne and things tend to be a bit elevated whenever you go to that end of town.There's a decent lunch menu offered to go with the complementary chips and salsa - which was awesome.  I'm a huge cilantro fan and you can tell they make their salsa fresh (not out of the bottle).I had a chicken taco salad and was surprised at how big the lunch portion was.  It was packed full of chicken and the sour cream and guacamole was off to the side so you can choose to make your salad "even healthier" if desired.Service was great and quick.... definitely a great spot for lunch and I am assuming a good spot for dinner as well.
3	Was taken here for a work lunch the other day.  The food was reasonably tasty but unexciting.  When I order carnitas, I expect meat that's been cooked to extreme tenderness, not big chewy pork chunks.  Rice and beans were just OK, and normally I'll hoover up every black bean on my plate, but I felt no compulsion to finish them.  The nopales salad on the side was tasty, and the salsa that came with everything was yummy, as others have mentioned.  My companions seemed pretty happy about their fish tacos, so maybe I'll try those if I get brought back here again.  I'd say, don't go here expecting anything other than lightly spiced totally Americanized Mexican food. It's not bad for what it is, but the whole experience, food and ambiance, seems designed to be nonthreatening to middle-aged white people. If I want that kind of experience, Cantina 1511 does it way better.  And since I live a few hundred yards from some of Charlotte's real Mexican and Salvadoran holes-in-the-wall, I'd probably give Zapata's a pass if I were the one picking the restaurant.
3	The food was good.  Did not get to enjoy it because they would not turn on the air condition.  It was hard to enjoy the food due to heat.
3	I haven't been to many Mexican restaurants in the area, so I don't know what the standards are for authenticity around here, but this is a very stereotyped Mexican restaurant.  The decor, music, food, everything is not like it is in Mexico, it's like you might think Mexico is like if you've only experienced Mexico from Epcot and old movies.  The food isn't bad, but it's not great either...and there is A LOT of food.  So it's a great value if you're hungry and definitely edible.  They have a few items that aren't found in most such places so that's good, but I'd guess that if you wanted Mexican food it wouldn't matter if you chose this place or one of the other equivalent places around here.
2	OK Mexican dishes. Not authentic but good and tasty. Quick fix if your in that neighborhood.
4	Granted, it's been years since my first (and only) visit to Zapata's, still a fave of my sister's who lives in the city, but this is the best place I've had AUTHENTIC sangria, outside of Madrid!  Yes, sliced and halved fruits steeped in good red wine, not fruit juices.  At least, that's how our sangria was served all those many years ago (late 90s or early 2000s).  I plan on asking her to take me here again on my next visit next month, so I might have an update!  :)  Stay cool!
4	Earlier tonight I had the pleasure of eating at a gem of a restaurant in the University Area of Charlotte, NC - Zapaata's Cantina Mexican Restaurant.  I have been eating at Zapata's since 2002, and like a fine wine, the place gets better with time. We arrived around 7pm on a rainy Thursday evening.  (If you've never been to Zapata's in University Area before, it can be kinda tricky to locate.  It is in the back left of the plaza.)  When my date and I walked in, we were greeted by a friendly gentleman host, who gave us the option of sitting upstairs or downstairs.  Since we've seen the place before, we chose to sit upstairs.  No sooner were we seated, when warm tortilla chips, and two bowls of fresh pico were placed before us.  Tecate was on special, so I gladly order one, my date ordered a coke that didn't taste quite right. (YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM THE SODAS.)  Our drinks, including ice-cold water; were brought to us within minutes.  My drink came in a can, however it was accompanied with a frosted-mug and fresh lime.  I order the fajitas-burrito, my date ordered the (grilled) shrimp tacos.  Both orders arrived promptly and smoking hot to our table.   On my plate was a giant burrito stuffed with chicken and steak (I always get the mix), beans, cheese, peppers, and onions, etc.  The outside of the massive burrito was smothered in melted cheeses including guacamole and sour-cream which were splattered across the top.  The shrimp-tacos looked just as appealing.  Both entree's were brought to our tables on extremely hot plates. and were surrounded by warm refried-beans and yellow rice - cooked to perfection.  We both loved our meals.  We both had plenty to put in a box and take home for a late-night snack or lunch tomorrow.  There is much debate amongst life-long UCBers about which is the best Mexican restaurant in the University Area; with the contestants being Monterrey, Los Arcos, or Zapata's.  My nod goes to Zapata's by a smidgen over Monterrey!Our Bill: 1 coke, 1 Tecate, 2 waters, 1 fajitas-burrito, 1 shrimp-taco = $30.00Service:  The service is simply amazing.  I've probably been to Zapata's over 20 times, and even though I've have had a few not so tasty meals, the SERVICE has always been top-notch. BEWARE OF:  **If you get the shrimp tacos, I recommend them grilled.  **Watch for the pulled-chicken.  It's not so tasty compared to the chicken-breast or steak.  **$2.25 Tecate cans on Thursday nights.  **You can get a steak/chicken mix with the burritos
5	This is REALLY good Mexican!  We went there two nights in a row when in town.
5	I usually avoid malls at all cost hut in Charlotte, there's no way to not eat at a mall depending on what you're looking for.  The menu was everything delicious.  I ordered the soup alboguins, (sp)  with lime and chorico and huevos and refried beans.  Absolutely delicious, fresh and filling.  It took a few days to finish my leftovers in the hotel, but I was determined not to waste that.  Even cold, it was just as tastey, for me, that is the true test of how good a dish can be, if its gross cold, then you shouldn't have ordered it or cooked it in the first place.  This location is in a university type mall/plaza, hadn't been there in years and not too much has changed.  Everyone enjoyed their meal, I highly reccomend eating here for a bite when ever and where ever you may be in Charlotte.   The service was great, friendly and just smelling the food cooking, just made you want to eat everything.
4	The service was fast and attentive. The food was hot, fresh, and tasty with large but not overwhelming proportions. Would definitely return.
2	Not the best mexican restaurant. The food was very bland and a little bit over priced for what it really was. I ordered pollo fundido which is pretty good, but they served it with slices of american cheese on top, which is not how pollo fundido is supposed to be served. I would not recommend this mexican restaurant if you are looking for authentic mexican food.
1	Terrible, none of the owners or the cooks have been near Mexico or real Mexican food. avoid if you can.
5	My very first review could only be that of Zapatas Cantina, or "Zaps" as I like to refer to it as.I frequent this dining establishment more than any other in my life. Very much at the pinnacle of decent restaurants located in the university vicinity of Charlotte, it has all the ingredients: the food is of upper-end quality, it's modestly priced, and has a fresh atmosphere. HOWEVER, if you are looking for a place with a staff that can understand and replicate English well- this place is not for you. I've heard various people toss that comment around every now and then. It may just be my opinion, but it seems as though the best authentic, non-American eateries are those with misplaced English skills, or a complete lack thereof. Now I myself usually don't deviate from an ace menu item once I've found it, and as such I've had the same "Southwest Quesadilla" from Zaps for the past 6 years. First thing I've ever ordered from 'em. Think I care? Nah. Sure don't. I have only recently been "around the block" with other various items on the menu and to no shock whatsoever, find them all exquisite as well.Overall, here are a few things to consider about the business: 1) Adequate spacial constraints with an up and downstairs, each consisting of its own outdoor section, 2) lakeside view, 3) great food/ menu combinations & a plethora of menu items from a very basic "kids" to a "make-your-own" spin off anything they have to offer really, 4) generous portion sizes, 5) full bar selection and quality margaritas, 6) drink specials for every day of the week, 7) VERY quick service (9 out of 10). Can't beat it.And for Cinco de Mayo? This is the place to be.
1	Terrible.  The food is bland and boring.The service was fast and friendly, but that doesn't make up for the complete disaster of a meal that we were served.I really can't overemphasize how bland everything was.   Don't go here if you require food that has some kind of flavor.
2	Fist I will say the staff is friendly and the patio has a great view. They have pretty good drink specials. Really the only reason I would ever come here again is to drink on their patio.The food is quite bland. I mean, the "salsa" is like runny marinara with some onions in it. I ordered the veggie burrito with no cheese. The thing was loaded with rice and lettuce, save for a few carrots, peas, and corn here and there. There was no seasoning, or none noticeable. It's wasn't all bad though, at least the ingredients were fresh and not over/under cooked.As stated, this would be a good place to have a drink on the patio, not so much for lunch, and definitely not for impressing others.
1	Um...no!Chips are obviously from bags.  Salsa were runny and definitely not spicy.  (Remember - "made in New York City?!?!?)I had the carne asada.  It was ok.  I usually devour the entire place but I just couldn't get into it.  The rice was bland.Overall, it was just disappointing!  I should have just eaten at Qdoba which was nearby.Service was mediocre. Moral: just because it is right next to the hotel doesn't mean food is gonna be awesome.
1	I've eaten here for years.  I used to like it alot.  But over the past year or two, it's been downright mediocure.  Today it bordered on gross.  I ordered a beef quesidilla and thought I was getting steak.  I got some geasy ground beef I asume they use for tacos.  It bore no resemblance to a quesadilla.  It was just a taco with stuff on top. I  would have done better at Monterrey's, or even Taco Hell.
3	The food is average americanized mexican but the service can be improved. Although the waiter was prompt, our order was incorrect and we did not receive any refills. There were only about 4 parties in the restaurant so it wasn't due to being busy.
5	This place has authentic Mexican cuisine. I came here with my sister who has been talking about the wonderful food here.We tried the vegetarian fajitas and Mexican stir fry. Both were delicious. Their tortila chips were served hot and the salsa was a little different but okay. The servers were courteous and the service was pretty quick. I will visit this place again!
4	One of my favorite spots in university to have s good time! The service is fast and the food is ok. although I believe the margaritas are not made from fresh ingredients, they are some if the best in town. The facilities needs some cosmetic work but you'll never this place in a worse mood than you came.
4	First of all, what a lovely location!  Outdoor seating with a view of the lake available.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas with Mexican rice and retried beans.  Creamy, simple goodness.  Pre dinner, the customary chips and salsa arrive.  The salsa is a bit bland for my taste, but I like over the sand dune hot, which sets me apart from the general public.  Good, courteous service earns points.
4	love this place, we always have a great time!
1	Terrible food, service always rushed.  I've waited longer at Taco Bell, and had better tacos.  The food is greasy and tasteless.  Zapata's has a few small positives.  Their outside patio looking over the man-made pond is nice.  Their margaritas are good, chips and salsa decent.  When I'm just meeting a friend for drinks, not a meal, this place is fine.
3	Service gets 5 stars, but food has always been just barely above average.  Fajitas should come out hot but never do.  Chips and salsa are good once you ask for pico de gallo and chipotle salsa to add to the regular red.  The outdoor porch, overlooking the pond, is really nice, especially when there is live music.  Most weekend nights have some sort of entertainment.  Good drink specials, and plenty of margarita flavors (top shelf margaritas for $6).  While it's not the best Mexican I've ever had, it's convenient, got a nice atmosphere, and the food is consistent.  I have been here many times and will continue to go back, despite my lackluster rating.
5	Went here with my Girlfriend and let me tell you that first off the Customer Service was GREAT ! I mean they was on point.... The food was Great also and I highly recommend.
3	Been here a few times. But nothing about it is wow to me. The food is ok, same as the service. The best thing is there location. Other than that there are many better Mexican restaurants in the area with better pricing and service. Don Pedro's and Cazuela's being 2 of my top choice.
4	Torn between 3-4 stars, but have to give this place a 4.Located right in front of our hotel, it's convenient. We were seated right away, and given 2 large baskets of tortilla chips for our party of 5. I really like how they give us our own bowl of salsa per person, double dipping time! The restaurant wasn't too crowded, so service was fairly good. I had just landed from SFO, so wanted to unwind with my jack and coke. Others ordered the huge frozen margaritas that were very tasty! Very addicting!We ordered guacamole, which came in a huge molcajete, those stone looking bowls. Lots of guac but a bit bland for my taste, had to add salt to my portion. Flipped through their book of a menu, and everything is fairly cheap! I wanted variety so went for the chicken tamale, ground pork enchilada, and chile releno with refried beans and mexican rice. All this for $10! And the plate was huge!!! The enchilada was bleh, tamale was decent, but was blown away that their chile releno was so tasty. It's really hard to find a good one, but this chile not only had a kick to it, but lots of cheese.Coworkers also all enjoyed their dishes for the most part. The food is good, but not out of this world. Towards the end of dinner, service was...gone. I waited 10 minutes for another jack and coke, and he totally forgot so had to ask another guy. It basically came as my dessert as we were all done. They do give a mini dessert to all, fried crispers with whipped cream on top and a bunch of cinnamon.Decent tasting food and huge portions for a very low price.
1	I should've just gone to Taco Bell or Monterrey. After hearing rave reviews from Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Dominican friends, I finally got the opportunity to eat here last night. I arrived around 9:30pm and was sat instantly. we were the only party in the upstairs part. My friend, who is Mexican, chose to get the rice water (forgot the original name) and it was delicious! Chips and Salsa was plentiful, I didn't care for the salsa at all. Tasted bland and watered down to me. The chips were obviously out the bag, which I don't mind but some salt or some seasoning was needed. I ordered the Street Tacos and my friend got the Shrimp Fajitas. He loved his fajitas! Now, my Street Tacos on the other hand is a completely different story. The tortillas/soft taco shells were greasy and cold. I couldn't even eat them. The items inside the taco weren't that great either. Huge strips of chicken that tasted bland, barely there pico de gallo, and a sprinkle of cheese. There was lettuce and guac on the side. I also asked for sour cream on the side to try to make it taste good. It also came with rice and beans. The beans were beans, nothing special. The rice was the best part of the meal... but it was room temperature which I didn't like much.Service is the reason why I will never give the food another chance. Our server was Ingrid. She was pretty great at first. When a Spanish speaking couple came to sit upstairs, she began talking to them so me and my friend had to wait about 10 minutes for the check once we were done eating. Then, she assumed the checks were together and seemed to have a shocked look on her face when I asked to get them split. We had to wait about another 10 minutes for her to finish talking to her manager/co-worker. The thing that that really put the icing on the cake was seeing a charge for sour cream. I wouldn't have minded if I knew when ordering sour cream with my tacos that there would be an extra charge, but to me that is just Serving 101 to tell a customer that all add ons were extra. Paying $1.25 to attempt to make the tacos taste a little bit better was ridiculous. When asked about it she told me, "All add ons have a charge to the ticket". No attempt to atleast say, "I'm sorry, but sour cream has a charge." I just don't like being surprised when the ticket comes. There was a man, maybe the expo manager or kitchen manager that refilled our chips, salsa, and drinks. I'm not the greatest tipper, but I always tip 25-50% on inexpensive meals so I felt obligated to leave a note telling her that I would've tipped if I knew about the charge and if I could've got the ticket faster instead of watching her chit chat literally right in front of me while waiting for my ticket One of the first times in a while that I didn't tip. I'm in the service industry and I know that if I ever treated a customer like that, I would've gotten wrote up and had to have comped their meal out of my pocket. Super long story short: Sub-par food, worse service.
5	This is the second year I use them to Cater our end of year company event. [I've never actually ate at the restaurant] About the Catering:They were awesome! so professional! they came to our job with everything ready to go, they set up and served all our employees. The food was great and had a lot left over, even though we ordered lunch portions. I also ordered a Flan, which was delish! I would definitely recommend them as caterers.
3	Food was only ok here. Wasn't what I was used to like back home in California. A good thing about this place is that they give you good size portions for a good price. They have a good happy hour here as well for margaritas and beers. The place is comfortable with dinning availability upstairs and downstairs.  Again the food was quality was average. If you are looking for a place to satisfy your hunger then this is your place.
5	Had an amazing take out meal from here. The Hawaiian tacos were fantastic! Everything my party tried was great, very fresh and flavorful, and abundant portions. Excellent guacamole!
5	This place is seriously delicious. Good location. Quick service. Got spinach enchiladas and they were so good. I'll be back!
3	The service was good but I got the 'pollo poblano' entree and it was so not appetizing. The rice and bean stuff was fine but ugh I am never getting that again. They gave us some chips and salsa. The salsa was too liquidy. It sort of seems like as thought they added much more water into it. The dessert thing that they just gave us was interesting. So technically got an appetizer an dessert for free and they give you more so that's nice
1	The manager was rude! He wouldn't honor his own coupon because he said the printing company messed up! Then he said I couldn't get the Thursday drink special because I didn't have two people in my party! I told him it was unacceptable and he said well leave then if you don't like it! Upon my exit he resorted to name calling! Unfortunately he lost our business forever! Take our advise go to Los Arcos! We did and loved it!
2	The food was pretty good, But service was pretty bad. There were two waiters and about 4 tables but we had to wait almost half an hour to get a to go box and the check for some reason .
2	Some friends and I were staying at the Hilton Charlotte University Place just on the other side of the lake and walked over to Zapata's for dinner on a Saturday night, around 8 PM. The restaurant was busy, but there was an empty table right inside the back door. I walked over to the station at the base of the stairs and asked if we needed to wait or if we could just sit at the empty table and was told to go ahead and take a seat.Fast forward a couple of minutes and an employee approaches the table to ask us why we're sitting there. I explained that I was told it was okay, and after a short conversation with the person who told me we could sit there, the employee went about his business. We were given chips and salsa (chips were slightly stale and had no salt on them at all; salsa was AMAZING but served in horribly inconvenient bowls that caused a mess every time you dipped into them) and ordered beers and waters. The beers arrived quickly, but we had to ask not one but TWO more times before we finally got our water.Food-wise, I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas, which were extremely bland. My friend enjoyed his Pollo Borracho, mostly because of the sauce, but overall the food wasn't impressive. Getting our waitress to come back to our table to refill anything (salsa, chips, drinks) or to bring us our check was next to impossible. Honestly the only reason I'm giving Zapata's two stars instead of just one is because I know they were busy (and obviously that affects the quality of service) and because my friend enjoyed his meal, though I didn't like mine. That said, if I was to end up back in this area, I doubt I'd return to this restaurant.
5	Absolutely best Mexican in Charlotte! The service was prompt. The margarita was amazing! Best wings in Charlotte! The area are large and price is fair. Absolutely love the deck atmosphere. Must eat here frequently!
4	Just moved from San Diego, CA and trying to find a good Mexican food restaurant. Went here and was bummed that they didn't have Chile Colorado but they made up for it with how great their Garden Fresh Burrito was. It had tons of veggies grilled perfectly and it was more food than I could even think of eating. My husband had a shredded pork burrito and even though his was a bit small he said it was tasty. Definitely going to be visiting this place again.
3	Bottom line 3.5 stars.My date and I were greeted and seated promptly. The chips and salsa were delivered but the chip person made no effort to say hi or anything as they normally do in mexican restaurants.It took quite a while for a server to get our drinks and it also took too long for them to actually get our drinks out. After that, however, the service was much better.I ordered the shrimp tacos and my date ordered the fish tacos. My plate was quite good...the fried shrimp tasted amazing I was surprised. The refried beans were also tasty.The top shelf margarita had a good balance. Strong by flavorful.I have to point out one quick detail in hopes management sees this. After we were done eating and drinking I was going to use the restroom but a busboy ( the same guy who delivered the chips without a smile or a hello)  was sweeping the one toilet one urinal bathroom. He saw me and just kept doing his thing.  I ended up having to drive home to use the bathroom. I would suggest they clean the bathrooms after all or most guests are done eating or at least allow the guest to use it. The food was good the service could use some work, but overall not a bad spot.
1	Legitimately the worst Mexican food I've had in Charlotte. Possibly the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Tacos were cold, soggy and tasted microwaved. I think they might have given me an order that was sent back and was being held. The rice was pretty decent. I took my food to work because I didn't want to waste it, gave it to some friends and it was promptly thrown away.
4	Picked this restaurant because it was close to my hotel and was very pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the wings and they were excellent and the portion was huge.I then had the beef fajitas and they too were excellent and I washed them down with the special margarita of the day.  I will repeat the next time I'm in town.
1	My family visited the restaurant recently. There was a dispute about the bill and the manager was called in at the request of my family. The manager was not only not nice but very unprofessional. We are hard working people. We expect good service because we pay for what we order and also tip accordingly. We have never been treated so disrespectfully. There was not even an offer of, "I'm sorry for the misunderstanding".....Attention all managers: Being apologetic in the face of controversy doesn't suggest a weakness. There was not even an attempt to right the wrong. We work hard for our money also and like to be wise in spending as we make decisions to relax and have recreation. My level of disappointment can not be expressed any further than saying.....This was really awful treatment of guests in your restaurant. No words......
