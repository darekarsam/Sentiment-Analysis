5	I loved the way I looked after I got tanned :) Lacee is amazing and the tan lasted quite a while :) I will only go to her when I need a  tan when im in Vegas... Thanks Lacee!!
5	I used Sin City Tans right before my wedding, a recommendation from a family member. I was so impressed! Lacee (owner) was such a sweetheart and I felt totally comfortable with her. She came to my house, the price was great, and I've never had a better result! I've had a mystic tan, done self tanners and all that. After she was done (quickly), I had a very even,natural looking tan that lasted throughout my honeymoon. She was very professional and gave me all the do's and dont's to make it last. I will definitely use Sin City Tans again and recommend them to friends.
