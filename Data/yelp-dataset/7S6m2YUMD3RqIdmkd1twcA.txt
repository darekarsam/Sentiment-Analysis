3	Its ok for being in the ghetto
2	This particular Jack is sketchy very ghetto-ish Wouldn't recommended getting off n eating there. If you must, drive thru please... Employees are friendly n helpful but the customers... Just iffy
1	Horrible service horrible people that work there well I don't want to say people the drive thru lady was very rude a real b**** if you know what I mean! I don't recommend this location I even called the manager because of the way she was toward me and my husband. . It's not like we're getting our food free we pay for this stuff.. All I have to say if you don't like your job and what the hell are you doing there... rude lady!!... Besides all that she didn't even get my order right..
