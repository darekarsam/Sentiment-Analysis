2	I lived on top of this cafe and still visit IF I can grab a seat outside. I say this because neighbourhood is charming and you can usually get some sun. Inside always feels like a library and I feel like I'm yelling when I order. I don't really like that unless I want a quiet place to read or fiddle with my brain, but that's me.They are still a cybercafe, so I award retro points. For those of you who may not be familiar with this term, it means you can use a computer and internet for a reasonable price. Othewise, coffees and related drinks are okay. Locally made snacks are better than the salads/sandwiches they prepare.Conclusion: I'm more into the location than, say, the cafe
