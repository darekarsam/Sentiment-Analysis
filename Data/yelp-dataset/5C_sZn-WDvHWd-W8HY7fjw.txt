4	Cool cinema. Very new and clean. All the films are in French. We saw Eat, Pray, Love aka Mange, Prie, Aime here. It was all good. I would definitely return here the next time I am in Montreal.
1	I was recently in Montreal and wanted to take a break from sightseeing to check out one of the recent blockbusters.  I walked about two miles to find out that everything was dubbed in FRENCH.  Now I like to think I'm not an obnoxious American who wants everything to fit my needs, but COME ON!  It's a brand new movie and last time I checked, Canada has two official languages.  double sad face :( :(
4	Interesting experience here tonight. This place will get four stars from me because although I did not realize and was completely unaware that this is a Francophone theater and there is not a word of English ANYWHERE, I was able to get a refund for the price of my movie ticket. I believe I spoke to a manager of some sort who was standing next to the girl taking tickets and he said very politely that I could do this and I did with no trouble at all. I felt bad doing this because since I am learning French, you'd think I'd have stayed for the educational experience. However, when I see a movie, I need to understand everything from the language to nuances to context. I can't afford not to understand the language and my French is simply not good enough. Anyways, so even though I did not see a movie, I still left the theater satisfied. All I ask is that the Cineplex website mention that this is a FRENCH-only theater. Folks, consider yourselves notified.
