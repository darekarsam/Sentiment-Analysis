3	This is a 'Superstore' and the biggest close by supermarket for Leith / Shore residents. It has 2 entrances one at the Tesco Car park at the back and the back entrance on Duke Street. It is a Tesco supermarket and they do what supermarkets do. In addition to that they have also clothes and electricals available.For a so-called Superstore it is a little small. but it supplies what is needed and it is open from 06:00 till Midnight. Be aware that the law of baying alcohol before 10am  and after 10pm also counts for supermarkets.. Some Leith residents tend to 'forget' that rule and get into a discussion a the till. - happened a few times. They have a section dedicated to self-service tills and 2 fast lane basket only cashiers. They are not as frequently visited by me, certainly after the whole Horse meat scandal. But they are a handy go to for packaged products. Whiskies, spirits, wine and chocolates. - that's about it. Not the worst of shops, but not the best either
4	I rather like the Tesco actually.Located on Duke Street, and accessible from Leith Walk and Easter Road, it has what you'd call a colourful clientele... but what's life without a bit of variety? It's a good size - not superstore big, but a decent, proper supermarket size, and easily reached by a variety of buses.It's big enough to have an electricals section, but not big enough to stock clothes. It has everything you need, and being Tesco, a great world foods aisle with massive bags of rice etc. as well as lots of Eastern European foods, and American and Irish products too - just in case you fancy some Taytos or Barry's tea. The American products, whilst pricey, are considerably cheaper than in those American Candy Store type places.There are hot food, deli and fish counters too if you fancy something a bit fresher and not already packaged, as well as all the usual supermarket fare.In short, it's a great resource in this part of town and makes a nice change to 'metro' stores!
