5	I've rented from here three times now, and it has quickly become the only place I will get a car from in Champaign-Urbana. The staff is nice, extremely helpful, and will go out of their way to make things run smoothly. I once called the day of a reservation to see if I could move up my reservation time, and not only did the woman I spoke to do so, she gave me an upgraded car for free because there wasn't a car in my price range available at the time. Highly recommended!
1	Nothing but bad service here.  The car was not ready when I arrived.  After waiting 30 minutes for it, it came to me with an empty tank of gas.  I was told I would get a 10% discount for my inconvenience but that 10% was not granted even after 3 separate calls to the office (each time I was told it would be credited to my card immediately).  Also the car had an issue where the dash would light up with alerts as if it were over-heating and then one minute later, resume normal operation.  I'm done with Enterprise for good.
5	This place is awesome. Everyone I dealt with was super helpful-from Courtney who helped book my car to the funny, friendly guy who drove me to and from the Enterprise facility. I had a great experience here and would recommend to anyone needing a car.
