1	I grabbed a burger/tots from this location on 12/2/11 (I typically don't eat "fast food" but I was in a bind.)About 3am the following morning I was sick, I have spend the last 10 hours or so throwing up and cementing my ban on fast food.Customer beware, nothing feel worse than food poisoning. This is not just upset stomach, it is full on horrible.
4	The staff is always super friendly and fast.
1	The ONION RINGS we were served were SOUR!!! The MANAGER who took my order "managed" to Screw up my order. Then the carhop brought my change back covered in spit. Every time we go to this location they add something to our order! TERRIBLE LOCATION that should be SHUT DOWN.
1	This is my third visit and my last. The drive through is always slow. today after 5 mins waiting I honked horn and talked to the speaker. nothing. At 8 mins tried again. Then left. As I drove by I could see 5 to 8 people inside playing around not doing their jobs. so off to Wendy's across the street. They were super fast, courteous, and we're happy to be doing their jobs. So very unlike the horrid sonic that we will never return to.
5	Greatest American food I have ever had in my entire life. Burgers, Chicken, Fries, Tots, Onion Rings, Corn Dogs, Hot Dogs, Ice Cream, Slushies, Breakfest and everything else they have is great.
5	Super clean... Customer service is amazing... Would definitely recommend and will be back... Come here for lunch break with my classmates quite often never had a bad experience
