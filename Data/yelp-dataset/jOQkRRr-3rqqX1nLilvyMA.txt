3	I don't suggest the average person decide to enroll in this day school, or pay an impromptu visit, because as beautiful as it is to look at, it is definitely a monument still in use!I've walked past this ancient building everytime I go down Lauriston Place from the George Square university area, and I'm always amazed that some kids actually get to go to school in Hogwarts. And I'm a little bit jealous as well. The grounds are massive, and I doubt those little children really deserve such a beautiful academic environment. Honestly though, the oldest students there are probably just a year or two younger than I am, but I'll rant on anyway! The school was commissioned by George Heriot, and it's a little sad to think such a place, with it's wonderful renaissance architecture, started off as a charitable institution for children, but is now a fee paying school.Nevertheless, they have open days on in September, should you really want to explore the school.
