5	Faith and her crew did an excellent job providing my wedding bouquet, my groom's boutonniere and all the flowers for our reception.  She worked with us to provide us a beautiful package that fit our budget.  She is very patient and knowledgeable!  I highly recommend them for your Las Vegas wedding!
1	worst experiense ever! I ordered from FTD website. The flower I got are weaky, old, unfresh. it looks so ugly! wont trust either FTD or this flower shop any more! Never! ever!
5	Faith from We Luv Flowers did an amazing job with my wedding flowers. All my guests were at awe when they walked into the banquet room and so were we. Her team and herself went above and beyond for us and did exactly what we requested with our arrangements, even though we bought our own vases, crystals and led lights Faith put it all together for us.
1	Ordered flowers through FTD more than one week before Mother's Day,  for delivery the day prior.  FTD failed to make sure the flowers were delivered on the date promised.  When delivered the next day, the flowers appeared to be old and not vibrant.  Very disappointed with FTD and We Luv Flowers by Faith fir not completing the order nor contacting me to apologize.
5	Gorgeous flower bouquet from my boyfriend as a congratulations for a job offer. The delivery person brought the flowers straight to the restaurant where I work.Love getting surprises!!
5	Perfection. I ordered flowers which was  the Patriotic Tribute -  a military flower arrangement. The flowers were fresh and came in a timely manner.  Their response to my questions were prompt. What more can you ask for? Thank you for such great customer service and for such a great arrangement.
