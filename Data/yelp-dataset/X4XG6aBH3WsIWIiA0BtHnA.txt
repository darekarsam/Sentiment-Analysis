4	Many happy lunchtimes were spent at this Chick-Fil-A, conveniently located in the basement of the Cathedral of Learning. It was perfect for all of the Summer Language Institute students and is within walking distance from the dorm towers.It is a smaller version of the chain restaurant, but carries almost all of the items on the nation-wide menus. My favorite will always be the little chicken nuggets with waffle fries and extra ranch sauce.
1	**It's pretty bad**This location is the the G level (basement) of the beautiful Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh's campus.There's not much to say, otherwise.... so here goes the list:PROS:  The only "real" food in the Cathedral (other than the salad/wrap-type offerings from the cafe).CONS:Staff is terrible (rude, unprofessional, and irritated by the notion of having to do their jobs);Food is always sub-par because its sitting under heat lamps or an undefined amount of time.Because its laid out like a cafeteria (you get a tray, get your chicken and get fries if you want it on your own from the heating unit), there's not much else to talk about.It could also just be my imagination, but I have stopped getting food here, altogether... I think their chicken is fattier than other Chick-Fil-A's.I always get the chicken "nuggets" and this is the only location where fat/gristle is an issue 100% of the times ordered.BLECH!     :X
1	YUCK!!!! Go elsewhere for your chicken!
