4	Loved it the first few times I went - it was packed and there were plenty of ladies to meet. Even up through Halloween, it was full on weekends and holidays, but pretty empty on weekdays (and they tried to charge cover when it was empty!). However, I went here on New Year's and my single friends were sad because it was all couples and ladies on dates. Around 1 am, a bunch of single, straight dudes randomly turned up?!  The DJ outside in the freezing cold was much, much better than the indoor DJ too. I like L4 a lot, especially the patio, but it's too cold out for these shenanigans. They seem to be struggling, I hope they make it to the warm weather so we can take advantage of the patio again.
4	The owners were very nice. Nice group of ladies and gentlemen working there.   We had a great time meeting people. The decor is lovely! We all loved it. We will be back!  Ps They have security people which is awesome if you go by yourself to the bar.
5	I just moved to Charlotte and decided to check this place out by myself. L4 is great! Hip hop nights on Friday are a blast! The staff is friendly, fast and attentive and the drink prices are reasonable; 2.50$ PBRs! It made a great impression on me when one of the owners walked by and introduced herself. I also met and talked to several people; really friendly crowd! The outdoor patio area is nice, but in November-a little cold! I'll definitely be back!(They also have hookah)
