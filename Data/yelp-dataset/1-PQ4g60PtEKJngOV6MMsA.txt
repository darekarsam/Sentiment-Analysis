2	the whash itself was fine, especially because I chose only their $4 basic..  but driving home one of the silver strips flew off my door (around the window) and so that's forever lost.  not blaming it on the car wash, was just coincidence butas never happened before!  anyway, i'll give them another shot with their other wash option..  they're close to home and it's an older car anyway. ;)
4	I like that this car wash has self service and drive thru options. The self service option is great because you can get your car as sparkly as you like it and you get a great workout in. It does require you to have quarters (or small bills for the coin machine) and I typically use 2-3 rounds, so about $6. Not bad! I definitely recommend bringing another person to tag team and use the most out of the time you buy and a drying rag. They also have free vacuums behind the self service washes.
5	These guys do a great job. I've looked everywhere for a drive thru wash with soft pads so it doesn't scratch my paint..drive thrus r harsh on black..and not only does this place have it but the guys come out and give ur car a pre hand scrubbed wash down..legit..$5-7 can't beat it. Both me and my fiance come here..both black sports cars and never worry about scratches. :)
