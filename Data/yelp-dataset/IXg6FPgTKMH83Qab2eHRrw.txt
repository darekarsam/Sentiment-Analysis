2	Not the best Rotisserie Chicken in town, but it's good enough when you are hungry. This location has an express take out window that is nice and quick. The chicken is passable and the coleslaw is pretty good, you can get better.
1	One day when I'm really really rich I'm going to buy all of the St. Huberts in the world and shut them down permanently. This place is so awful. Everything about it was so wrong, the food is gross, the waiters suck, the drinks were hard to swallow, and it wasn't even cheap! Never never never ever ever ever again.
