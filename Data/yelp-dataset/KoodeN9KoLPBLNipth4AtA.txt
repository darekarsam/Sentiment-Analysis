5	Nice, clean, quiet. Caring staff! They even took care of me as I started to pass out:-)
4	Great Staff! Short Wait! All around great experience!
1	What a horrible customer service. Wrong info on the phone. Impersonal and not particularly knowledgeable stuff. Huge lune up. Bad atmosphere. For high prices of lab work and decent location this place is a disgrace to medical care. Never again. Sonora lab maybe decent. Just not this location!
