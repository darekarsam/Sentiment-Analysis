1	Food sucks. Service sucks. Beer was flat. Don't even think about going to this location to watch a hockey other then habs. Kings playoff game was on silent while they kept the music blasted, ain't this a sports bar? Maybe they should change the name to "this location shall only let you listen to the games we choose"...I don't bother with this location anymore...all of the cage locations for that matter
3	Visited Le Cage Sports Bar this summer to view a World Cup (Colombia) game as we were traveling with a true fan. To our surprise a large crowd (in  jerseys) was also in attendance which made for a fun afternoon.Service was friendly, full bar. We enjoyed our appetizers (wings and fries) and cocktails at the bar.
