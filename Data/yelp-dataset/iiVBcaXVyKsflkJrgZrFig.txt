5	I went in to sign up and the young girl was very nice, explained all my options and walked me to the tanning bed and showed me where the bathroom was... She was nice and thorough.... I went there with a one week free pass but will def b signing up.. Nice, clean, pretty good pricing and they r open late... 2 thumbs up
5	By far, the best tanning in Charlotte. Friendly  and knowledgable staff. They are happy to provide info and offer suggestions. Very clean and great beds!  Love this place!
2	I used to prefer this place over palm beach. I don't think so anymore. They think it's acceptable to place customers in beds with facial bulbs out consistently. I remember over summer there was one bed with facial bulbs out for over a month, yet they would place me in that although there were empty beds of the same level with all the bulbs working. It's kind of ridiculous to pay $30+ a month for this to keep happening. I went again within the last few days and there was another bed with facial bulbs out and of course, I was placed in that one instead of the other empty, working beds. Show a little customer service and appreciation and put me in a fully working bed AT LEAST. Most places will give you a free upgrade in situations similar to this.
5	I bought a groupon for a month of tanning. I have been previously for a spray tan which turned out great and now I decided to try the actual tanning beds. The facility was clean and the front desk person knowledgable, helpful, and very friendly. Maybe after my 30 day groupon expires, I'll get a membership.
