1	The guys at the gun counter turned me off of this place right away. Just ignorant dicks who don't want to give you the time of day. Asked to look at a rifle and got pure attitude from the guy behind the counter. Won't be back
5	The staff here couldn't be more helpful. They have taught me more about the sport in a year then I thought possible. The attached club is also a great place to meet other shooters and learn.
4	There are a few people there that won't even give you the time of day, but the rest were excellent. Patient and knowledgable. Really enjoyed my last 2 visits after being turned off the first time in there.
