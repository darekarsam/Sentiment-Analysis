1	I ordered the chicken kebab from here with all the toppings.  It wasn't cheap and the chicken was terrible (no flavour, weird rubbery texture).  It was for take away and I threw the kebab away half way through eating it was so bad.  The kebab came out quick but I'd prefer to wait for freshly cooked chicken.  Go to samsuns or trek over to kebab mahal for a good kebab.
1	Not so good chicken was not good had odd spice and was cooked in the pizza oven not even grilled. Pizza I shouldn't comment since I live in NY it just wouldn't be fair. Mince pie was stone cold  but the pita was good
