3	Not very good on greeting people when you walk in but, the Deluxe pedicure was AMAZING!! Def worth the $30.00
4	This is both, hair and nail salon! Queen is my tech and she is always friendly, quick, and does very good work. The wait is never long, but anytime I call head for an apt. they start me right at my apt time. The salon is always clean. I love the variety of Gel Colors. I have yet to get a pedicure, but I have read some good things about that service, plus a hotstone massage is only $20. They also do eyebrows & waxing. Prices vary, but generally a manicure & Gel polish will cost around $30-$35, the more complex the work, the more in cost. But the work is worth the price in my opinion.
5	I love coming here!!! They are super nice and many colors to choose from. I'm a regular because the pricing is great. They always fix my nail if it breaks within a week. Since, my nails always seem to break;(
