5	I love signature nails!!!! The salon is relaxing and is always clean. Ms. Vicki and Ms. Lucy do the best nails, they dont rush when they are with you. They have a lot of designs to choose from and will make up a design for you, if you want. I give these ladies 10 stars!!!!I love going some place that remembers your name everytime you go and I love seeing mamma!!! :)
5	Vicki and Lucy are talented nail technicians, I visit them often for manicures, pedicures, and waxing. It's better to call them to make an appointment considering it's just the two of them; they ALWAYS have same-day appointments.I don't go anywhere else because I feel like a valued customer.
5	Very amazing ambiance. The owners are very friendly and extremely customer service oriented. I came at 6 for a full set and Vicky got me in and out before 6:45. Her work is A+ quality and she's just so awesome. I get the full set with gel and that's $28. I always leave her a nice tip because it's awesome when they know you by name especially after only going there a few times before. I loves this place and will continue coming back!!
