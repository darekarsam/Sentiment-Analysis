2	Food was overpriced and not memorable. I did not have a bad experience, but I have no desire to come back again - even though I was staying in the hotel adjacent to the restaurant.The atmosphere and decor are a bit swanky and inviting, so a nice place to stop in for a quick drink.  I didn't like the red wine selection at all - no robust varieties.
2	I travel 20 days a month and this was worst service I've in the past year.  The sad part is that the staff had no idea their service was awful because they were never properly trained.  I sat down at the bar and waited 10 minutes as the one server and one bartender chatted with their friend who was charging her i-phone.  I finally ordered a corona and it came with no lime.  The bartender then left and continued her conversation with her friend and server.  Oh, I forgot to mention, I am the ONLY person in the bar/restaurant.  After another beer I asked the server to see a menu.  I ordered the pheasant ravioli (which was quite good actually), but I never recevied a napkin.  When I asked to see the wine list and ordered a bottle of Pinot to go with my duck magret (not so good), the make-shift bartender brought out a bottle of champagne and proceeded to open it.  I quickly stopped her and asked for the bottle I ordered.  She then grabbed her friend's i-phone and had to make a call to someone to make sure I got the right bottle of wine.  I was laughing/feeling bad/annoyed by this point, so I told her I would just have a glass of the house pinot.  To her credit, she filled it to the brim and made an apology.  I give this establishment 2 stars only because the bartender and server were extremely nice - they just had absolutely no idea of what they were doing... I might come back for a casual drink but I would only stick to beer - I would prefer not to have my cocktail prepared via a mixology app...
