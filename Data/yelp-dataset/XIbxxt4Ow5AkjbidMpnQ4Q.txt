5	Fun, Clean, and FreeGreat facilities. Our church uses this once a year for annual sporting fellowship get together.  Has basketball, softball, and sand volleyball pits.  Clean.  They do have restrooms and water fountains.  Dog park next door.
5	Great park. 2 different sized playgrounds. Swings for babies and older Holstein. Ramadas with picnic tables. Also there is a nice paved circle shaped path for bike riders. Oops can't forget the tennis and basketball court!
5	This is an impressive park. The community building offers a variety of activity. There are good playground and picnic areas. It is set up well for several sports. There is a dog park sometimes available but it is nice for walking a leashed dog too. Plenty of parking.
4	Super clean and friendly park. Activities are always going on and the place is very well lot. I felt safe walking around this place by myself after dark.
3	This was our neighborhood voting location.  Easy in/out to park.  The park facilities seem nice.  Should've received 4 Stars, but the girl working the front desk didn't know that they were a voting location and when I asked, she said "I'm not sure...."  Seriously?The park area is nice, we've walked our dogs here before.Return Factor - 80%
3	I go to the dog park when I don't feel like driving down to chaparral. My biggest issue is lack of light at night. Unless there is a game at the field next door the dog park is pitch dark.
