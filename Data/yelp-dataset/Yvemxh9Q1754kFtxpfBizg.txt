2	You would think it would be hard to screw up a concept as simple as Subway but this one has managed to underwhelm me on two separate occasions.  The first time I figured it was just a fluke, but going again today and getting the same service confirms that this is just how this place operates.I walk in today and there's a couple people sitting at tables but no one in line so I walk right up to the counter.  There's a girl behind the counter standing in the doorway to their back room and she kind of looks at me but doesn't say anything or walk over right away.  After a little bit she finally makes her way over to me, still doesn't say anything and starts putting plastic gloves on.  Then I think she might have mumbled something but I didn't hear her, she finally made eye contact with me though so I went ahead and told her what I wanted.  She seemed to be doing okay with actually making the sandwich until it came to the veggies (maybe she's got something against them?) because she practically pinched the lettuce and spinach to put on my sandwich.  No handful sized servings here apparently.When it came time to pay a guy was at the register to take my order and he asked the typical questions about whether I wanted it to go or not, did I want to make it a meal, etc. and then he gets to my total and says it's $6 something.  It took me a second but I thought about it and I only got a 6-inch sandwich with nothing else, so I asked him "How much did you say you're gonna charge me?"  To which he laughs and says, "Oh, you caught it!  Haha, April Fools!"  Ummmm.....I'm sorry but I'm not laughing.
