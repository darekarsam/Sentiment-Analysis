3	These lovely Chilean people came through for me on a catering job at the last minute. I had a very specific menu (definitely NOT Chilean) and they came through brilliantly. Every dish was amazing and the price was more than right. I'll add another review once I have a chance to get up there and taste their empanadas for which they have a variety of reviews on other sites. They're quite new and are still finding their feet from what I understand but, they came highly recommended and really saved my event.
4	first entered for nature's call, but once relieved, had aromatic attention telling me to find out what cuisine is served, the answer was prompt - Chilean. then i remembered seeing Bistro Araucaria on the board outside, plus the inviting patio table and chairs.On the advice of Paula's younger brother,  my friend and i opted to sg\hare the two recommended sptcials, Fish and Chips  and the other a tasty vegetable mash.The Fish was battered, not oily nor dark brown, but tempura like the fish was ocean and sweet , 5/5 .  Will be there again on next visit
2	Next door favorite Tachido was closed for lunch, so we sat out here for a patio lunch instead. The seafood empanada was really nice, but I'd look elsewhere.Rating Scale:1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here.
