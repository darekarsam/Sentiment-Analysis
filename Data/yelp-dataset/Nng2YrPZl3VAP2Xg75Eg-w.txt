5	i love starbucks!!the end.
4	I usually don't review when I go to a Starbucks coffee, because, well, Starbucks is what it is, everybody knows it, and you like it or don't. But since I had some time to waste waiting for the opening of a store nearby, I decided to treat myself with a hazelnut macchiato. And I did what I rarely do when I go to a Starbucks : I sat there. Enjoying the free wifi like all these people who usually abuse of it when you wanna sit but you can't because some people abuse of it and spend hours here. Anyway. Stop complaining grandpa. And I was welcomed with some really nice employees, and something surprised me. They seem to have regular customers who are treated like friends. Something I wouldn't be surprised of with a local small coffee shop, but I wasn't expecting this at a Starbucks. There's a really nice vibe here, and well, the coffee is not incredible and you can surely find better, but you can't say it's bad. *takes another sip of his pretty good hazelnut macchiato*Oh well, maybe I'll sit here another hour.
5	Great coffee and good service and the without mentioning any other names you can always find a place to sit !!
