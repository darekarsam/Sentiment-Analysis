5	Love this place!  Everyone is great and they are all concerned about the well being of these animals!  A fantastic place to find your next Furever Friend!
5	Super friendly staff that really try to get to know the animals to make sure they find they perfect forever home. I highly recommend this rescue to anyone that is looking for that perfect addition to their family. I know that if it wasn't for Furever Friends we would have never have found our Eve. Thanks again for everything and keep up the great work!
5	I absolutely love the staff at Furever Friends Rescue!!  We adopted the sweetest kitten from them last Sept.  Unfortunately he passed away in March from an unknown disease causing him to not produce red blood cells any more... we were devastated, but the staff has really helped with our healing.  We are now looking for another little boy to adopt, and are even going to volunteer with them soon!  They are really caring, and desire each precious animal to have a good home.  Thanks Furever Friends for what you do!!!
5	We went to Furever Friends to look at cats and dogs and left with the most amazing experience. Although, we are not ready to bring home a new pet, I will be returning here when we are ready. We have a very senior dog and it would not be fair for us to bring home or foster at this time. Thank you for all you do in our community to bring awareness to the cause of pet rescue.
