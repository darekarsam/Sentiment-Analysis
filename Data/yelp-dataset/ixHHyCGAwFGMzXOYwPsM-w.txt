4	I ate there the other night by myself, so I can't review much more food than I ate. Since the movie says "Yes, but can she make good aloo gobi" and since I like aloo gobi, I had it. It was good. Even the leftovers for breakfast.The vegetable somosa was a bit more bread and fried than I'm used to (flatter, so less potato insides). I tried the Kashmiri naan, and it was quite good, although not as good as they make at Mehak back in Berkeley (I have yet to find a Kashmiri naan as good as Mehak's).The chai was good, as was the service (although at first they did lose track of me for a short while).Update: I ordered take out a week later, and even though they asked me how to spell my name when I place the order, when I showed up 30 minutes later they could not find my order. Instead of saying "we'll cook it up for you right now," they said "we're really busy and it will be 30 minutes before it will be ready." I decided to go elsewhere. Too bad, their food was good when I ate it previously, I was just too hungry and pissed at them for not offering to put me at the front of the kitchen line.
4	My sister, Mom, and I have dined here a couple of times.  Great lunch buffet and good service.  Good naan and freshly-prepared dosas, although, as Mimi B. mentioned, the crepes aren't as crispy and golden as I've enjoyed at other restaurants .  Chai is good, but the desserts are even better!  Loved the carrot halwa.Udipi is a region in India, as well as a style of cooking, that is known for its vegetarian specialties, so veggieheads, as well as carnivores, will love the vast menu options offered here.  Definitely a great lunch stop in the Queen City!
1	CLOSED. Don't kill the messenger ! I did not get to try Udipi.Unfortunately, looks as if all these four star fans will be sad to learn this place has closed. Economy ?
