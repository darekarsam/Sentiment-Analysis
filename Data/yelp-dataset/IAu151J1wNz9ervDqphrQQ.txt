5	This QT, like nearly every other I've been to, is great.  Helpful staff who run two registers at once so you never get caught behind someone cashing in, then buying, a hundred scratcher tickets.Hallelujah!!
4	I LOVE QT's!!!!! Why settle for Circle K (B Lister) when you can go to the QT (A lister) right across the street? QT = Quality Time
5	Getting gas is one of life's little necessities and something few look forward to doing.  (Yea, I get to drop $50 again this week for the privilege of sitting on the 101 heading east into a blind sun at a blistering 5 mph at 7:30 am while jockeying for the pole position, heavy sigh-where was I. . . Having gas, er, getting gas.  QT is my go-to.  Never have to worry about them pulling an Office Space and going for a couple of extra cents per gallon (or more) like some C-Stores or charging me extra for using my charge card as opposed to my debit card.  I know and understand the metrics that cause some stores to use this tactic, grow up, take it on the chin, and take every card out there-most of you are charging more per gallon than your competition is anyway, and yes I'm looking at you Shell and Safeway.Fair pricing, clean well lit covered pumps and never any hood rats loitering around outside.I don't go inside very often but it's always clean with a cool selection of refreshments and ways to flavor them.  The pricing is appropriate and the employees are always pleasant, attentive, and well spoken.  (hint hint Circle K).We're fortunate to have so many great QT's in Phoenix, especially this one, a fine #439
