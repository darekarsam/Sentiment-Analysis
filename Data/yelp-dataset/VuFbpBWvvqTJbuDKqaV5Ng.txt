5	Love this school and would highly recommend any one who has children to attend! Amazing and loving staff!
5	Wonderful daycare/preschool. My kids have been there for 2 years and we have had great experiences with all of the teachers. They have a Christian environment which at this age is perfect for any religion- a good foundation of bible stories, God and kindness which we can build upon at home.
5	We love Paradise for Tots and everything about it.  They have amazing teachers and great leadership.  The ladies in the office have always been friendly, helpful and responsive.  We brought both of our children there over a period of four years.  They have both graduated and are attending an elementary school in the area, but we plan to continue bringing our children back to PFT for their summer enrichment for as long as we can (which is until the summer following 3rd grade)...at least the next 2 years.  In today's day and age, you want to be very selective about where you bring your children.  We have enjoyed great peace of mind, knowing our children were in caring and competent hands.  Thank you to PFT for doing such a great job in helping us develop our children during these important early years.
