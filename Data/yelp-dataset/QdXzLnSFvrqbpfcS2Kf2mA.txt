4	I have eaten at this restaurants several times. The service is very good, the waiters and waitresses are friendly and they come back to the table to refill your drink and keep checking on how you are doing. Unlike the Shoneys in University City the food is NOT overly salty and greasy. This Shoney's gets 2 thumbs up from me.
4	The $8.99 breakfast buffet was right on time! Our server was so attentive and polite, he checked on us often without being a pest. The food was delicious! I was lil disappointed there was no one making omelettes, but instead mini waffles. Overall great breakfast choices at a good price!
1	They are closed, went there for breakfast and the sign is even gone.
2	Ok
