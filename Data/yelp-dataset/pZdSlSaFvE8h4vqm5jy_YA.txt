1	I would put zero stars, but had to put 1. Incompetent driver, came read notes regarding address. First two days delivering to wrong apartment, I call and make sure its right and customer service makes notations for the driver regarding address. Too lazy to read he puts customer has moved.  ARE YOU SERIOUS? I just moved IN. My package was in the pile to be returned to sender. After arguing with customer service they have it rescheduled for tomorrow. Lets see if I actually get it or if the incompetent driver can't read again and mess up again. I needed this package the initial day it was set to deliver not almost a week later. I can see this driver is going to be a issue as I receive UpS packages atleaat once a week. Lets wait for a update tomorrow how this delivery turned out. I can bet its not good.
4	I was surprised to find the waiting area empty and waiting for me to mail my package. My transaction took less than five minutes and they were super friendly.
1	I sent my assistant to this UPS hub with an important package that needed to go overnight to Canada, apparently we had to use a hub in order to ship on our UPS account.  The person who received the package confirmed that it would be delivered by 10:30am the next day.  I received a phone call the next afternoon that the package had not yet left Las Vegas because there was no commercial invoice (required for shipping to Canada).  Annoyed that my package was delayed, I emailed the commercial invoice (which should have been requested upon dropping this off at UPS).  When the package reached customs in Canada I received another phone call about reaching the receiver to arrange pick up and payment of import taxes.  Why would my receiver need to arrange pick up and pay import taxes, you ask?  Well, it turns out the package was shipped without a street address, just a city, province, zip code and country.  Additionally, the hub did not submit the customs power of attorney form declaring that we, the shipper, would pay the import taxes.  It is now 4 days since this package was dropped off at UPS and the package is still stuck in customs in Canada. Moral of the story? FedEx, they're cheaper anyway!
1	UPS tried to deliver a package to us 2 days in a row. It required a in-person signature and unfortunately, we were not home at the time. So to avoid having it shipped back to the sender, I called the customer service line and asked them if I could change the delivery option to pick up at this customer center. The guy on the phone said that it would be no problem, and that I would be able to pick it up on Saturday since they were open from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm.So I drove down there Saturday morning, and guess what? The employee who helped me said that I would have to come back on Monday. UGH, REALLY?? He said that the package was still "locked up in the van" and there was nothing he could do about it. I guess it really wasn't his fault. But I think the guy on the phone should be fired for giving me the WRONG information! I was very upset because I wasted gas and my time, especially since I don't live anywhere near this location. On Monday morning, I called the customer service line again because this location doesn't list their direct number anywhere. I told this guy what had happened and asked him if he could confirm that my package would be ready to be picked up this time around. After being on hold for 5 minutes, he said that he talked to and employee at this location who confirmed that the package was in their back room. I drove down during my lunch break and surprisingly no other customers were there. I guess that was the only good thing about this place, not having to wait in line. The old lady that was working was very unfriendly. Boxes were all over the place and everything looked unorganized. But whatever, I was happy that I finally got to pick up my box and leave. UPS is horrible! FedEx is definitely more organized. Hopefully, I will never have to come back here again!
1	I'm standing here and it's been 25 minutes. They went to the back to get what I had to pick up. Came back asked me what it was and then disappeared just came back out looked at his computer didn't say a word then disappeared into the back not giving me any idea of what's going on I finally had to leave because I'd be at work now I have to wait till Monday to get my package that should've only taken 10 minutes pick up at the store customer service is awful and their organization is obviously very bad
5	I went on Saturday at noon and there was no line at all.  I was helped quickly and in and out of there in well under 5 minutes.
1	I had a package that was supposed to be delivered on Friday the 14th.  The package was picked up on the 7th.  Since they took the package to 3 different cities on the east coast before shipping it out west it didn't arrive to Las Vegas until the 14th.  Since the shipper didn't pay extra for weekend delivery now I have to wait until Tuesday, since Monday is a Holiday.  Why should I have to wait because of their screw up?  From now on I use Fed-ex.  Never have I had a package late with them.  Sometimes they cost a little extra but you get what you pay for.  UPS stands for "Unreliable Parcel Service".
1	If you can ship using another carrier, please do. A shipment was due to be delivered Thursday, it wasn't. It said shipment was due Monday. I called ups and asked to leave it at a location for pick up. The package was not available still until Monday.  The order was wrong so I tried to send it back using senders acct. No ups store would help. Had to come back to this dump. Line was out of the door. Lack of help here. Avoid at all costs.
1	I have been waiting for four days now for my package to be picked up from UPS. The first attempt pickup never happened!  I even have video it didn't!  I have contacted not only one but 5 people to get this done! I can't sit here in my house for hours running off hopes and dreams they will show up! This is ridiculous!  I made another complaint today and someone finally called and stated that the driver will be here today or tomorrow.  I told him I need to know the right day and time because this is getting out of hand. He said he would call me back. Two hours later NO CALL BACK. I tried calling him back with the number on my screen and sure enough, no voice mail... no NOTHING.   I am so fed up with this company.  I am union and I have never seen nor heard anything like this. This customer service is terrible. I will attempt on calling the "higher up" people. 4 days is too long. I missed my   vacation for this! I am so done.** REVIEW UPDATE 06/26/14**The manager finally called me back yesterday after 3 hours of waiting to tell me he'd call me back tomorrow morning between 9:00-10:00 a.m. to let me know when the driver will show up, and guess what? It is now 11:35 a.m. and there has been no call. I am not surprised.  I am so upset with this company's customer service.**REVIEW UPDATE 06/26/14**The manager finally called at 12:00 p.m. and said the driver will be picking up the package after 5:00 p.m. today. I really hope this will happen.  After 5 days waiting by the door gets pretty old. Not to mention I am losing my vacation over this.
1	UPS GETS IT WRONG TWICE (this is why, even with Vegas' poor service, I stick to USPS whenever I can)Today's delivery and complaint filed:UPS CHAT Initial Question: Complaint Nigel B.: Hi, this is Nigel B.. I'll be happy to assist you. Nigel B.: I'm sorry, what issue are you having? Patricia: Your driver just rang my doorbell and by the time I got to the door of my apartment.  Less than 60 seconds he had threw my fragile package on the back porch. Considering that it had been raining and there was standing water, I am doubly angry about this.  Patricia: On top of that he was rude when I opened the door, stating in should move faster.  Patricia: Also, according to your tracking info I believe I was supposed to sign for it.  Nigel B.: I can understand why this would cause great frustration. Nigel B.: I need to forward your information to the local package center for resolution. May I have your last name and phone number please? Nigel B.: This did not require a signature.  Patricia: The contents are not broken but they easily could have been and if I had not been home, there us good chance it would have most likely been wet.  Patricia: XXXXXXX. I can be reached via email. I prefer not to contacted by phone.  Nigel B.: I am sorry, that is not possible.  Nigel B.: The center can only contact by phone.  Patricia: I want something in writing. My phone has limited minutes and I'm not going to waste them so get a supervisor on the line and make it possible.  Nigel B.: I understand your request to speak with my supervisor. Please allow me a couple of minutes to review our transcript with them.   Patricia: I just want to know that the driver us reprimanded. There is nothing to "resolve." Nigel B.: Again, I can send a message to the customer center where the driver comes from to have them contact you by phone.  Nigel B.: That is the only way to be contacted. Patricia: I got a better idea. I will write up this experience on social media including Yelp.  Patricia: Good bye You have disconnected.
1	I am VERY disappointed with UPS. "We love logistics" is a joke of a slogan. I paid for 2-business day delivery that was supposed to arrive in this afternoon. The package was for business and time sensitive. My package never arrived and when I called UPS, the customer rep told me my package was delayed an entire DAY and that it was estimate to arrive at the END of the following day. What made it worse and what made me lose my mind was that UPS had NO IDEA why my package was delayed an entire day AND wasn't exactly sure where my package currently was. When I asked the lady if they can at least make sure my package gets delivered in the morning or afternoon, she told me that there was no way to do that and they only way I could get my package in the morning was if I drove 30 mins to a UPS Customer Center, otherwise I would have to wait up until 7pm to get the package delivered. Also, I needed to call or track the package again in the morning to make sure it even arrives tomorrow. WHAT???!!!UPS used to be good, but not anymore. I wouldn't have been so upset if UPS at least explained the reason for the delay but how can a shipping company that advertises great tracking and logistics services not be able to track my package???DO NOT USE UPS for important packages.
1	The business hours state that they open at 9am it's 9.17am now and they still didn't open. What a joke. Beside that my package was supposed to be dropped off at my house on Thursday which I needed badly for one of my customers, I paid for overnight shipping . It's now Monday and they still don't know where my package is.
1	The exact same driver was at a strip mall near where we live today. He was using the handicapped space as a loading zone. We found a nearby police officer and the guy actually debated the cop. He moved but as we were leaving, he made rude gestures my way. This guy is a jerk who hates persons with disabilities and I've had it with him. We filed a complaint and basically told UPS we never want this guy to come to our home again. We'll see how it goes.
1	This is my last update. I am not satisfied at all. After playing telephone tag for two days, with a package delivery pending the next day, I physically went to the site and spoke with Adrian Maldonado. He backed his driver completely, but told me that the immediate supervisor would be with him when he delivered my package and that the driver would personally apologize to me.The driver, who I now know is named Clark, didn't say a word until I asked him to apologize. I was told what a good driver he was for the past 15 years and that he would not be parking in handicapped spaces anymore and I had nothing to worry about in the future because he would do a good job. I had his bosses guarantee. When in response to the supervisor asking me if I was satisfied, I said, "No, it was my understanding that Clark would be apologizing personally," the supervisor tried to tell me that because he was the boss, I could be assured that Clark wouldn't do these things anymore. I again reiterated that this is not what I was told would happen. I then turned to Clark and explained to him directly why what he did was not cool.His non apology was "I'm sorry you feel that way." So some effort made, but not really changing my mind about how horrible this company is run locally. Still think Clark is an asshole who thinks this is all a joke. Why should he change. It is obvious his supervisors don't want to make him change and want to defend him. However, we are stuck with them for the moment because we have several items pending, but once our current situation changes, future efforts will be made to avoid UPS as much as possible. Supposedly competition was supposed to be good for the market, but now two companies dominate the delivery industry. FedEx is barely better. Competition, my ass. Big Brown's logo ought to be "Logistics over customers!"
1	To be fair, UPS does not allow people to call these centers to see if they can actually help you, so this is more a review of UPS and it's lousy business practice. I have to drive to the Henderson area and pick up a package to be shipped to another location. It will be a 250 mile drive for me. I need to know if this location can package, and ship using my corporate account, my order. I called a few of the satellite stores and they can pack, but cannot use my corporate account. The 800 number I was given cannot verify that this location will be able fulfill my requirements, but also says we cannot call them. How is this a good business model? I can do this through FedEx, but I was told UPS would save my company a few dollars. UPS will not miss my business, I'm sure, I just find it sad how lacking they are with customer service.
5	Ok everyone I went in today 10/07/14 at 2pm not knowing what to expect at all from this place,since it's reviews were horrible, and to my surprise the two gentlemen working were friendly . I was greeted as I walked in, one of the men walked right over and showed my what to do to print a label ,then offered paper for my box when he saw it wasn't full. They were both very polite and I'll go back to ship there,  they were way way more helpful then some of the smaller stores I've shipped from.  It was organized in there, quick,and easy. I'm not real sure why all the bad reviews but I thought they were great!
5	I have always had good service at this location. The people there work very hard at helping their customers with their specific needs. I rarely ever have had to wait in line. I really appreciate their Saturday hours too. I have also received good service when I have called into UPS for inquiries.
1	Awful awful customer service. Impossible to get any good information and the website is just awful. I've been stuck in a login loop and can't do anything
