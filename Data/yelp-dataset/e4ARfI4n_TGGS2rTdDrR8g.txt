4	I used to order subs during 14 hr shifts, to have half for lunch & half for dinner...It's been more than a year since I've had one, and I still crave them!  Ordering was easy and delivery was always much faster than expected.
5	They have the best subs in Charlotte, they make them just like being home in Jersey. I can usually get two meals out of a sub. Great meat and breads.Whenever I think about subs I think about Jersey Mike's.
3	Sub was really good. I feel like it was overpriced though. A drink and 2 subs was almost $20.
3	Have not been in a long time, BF is in LOVE w/Jersey Mike's, he recently ate there and SWORE it was better than every.. same ole Jersey Mike's... the staff was really nice/helpful, just not a big fan. Either you love JMs or you dont. I am on the fence.
5	Excellent old school jersey sandwich shop.  Reminds me of a sub shop down the shore. To bad they don't have 1980's prices.  But we love Jersey Mike's anyway. Can't wait to eat here again.
