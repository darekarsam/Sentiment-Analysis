5	Went there to get some breakfast and drinks. The classic sausage sandwich was fresh and hot. The drinks were made perfect, and the staff was friendly and efficient. Yet another good Starbucks location!
1	Ha! Location is so bad they created a duplicate entry to confuse people.  Read and believe bad reviews about this location's horrible service and poor quality.
1	Granted it is a Sunday morning but the drive thru has to be the slowest I have ever encountered!! Wow!! I had a choice of 3 locations to go to from where I was. I guess I didn't choose wisely!! Should have read the reviews first I guess. I was in the drive thru line from start to finish 15 minutes maybe even more. The person at the window was very nice though.
