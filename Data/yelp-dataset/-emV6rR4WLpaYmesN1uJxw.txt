5	I abbbbsoollluuuttteeelllyyyy LOVE Amy! I used to get facials from her when she worked at a different salon. She is the only person that I let touch my face. I'm so glad that she is at Icon now. I recommend her to EVERYONE.
5	I have had 3 body scrubs and 5 facials from Amy. She totally had me relaxed. Her spa room at Icon is very soothing relaxing atmosphere!
5	Two days before my wedding I went to Amy for a Brazilian. I heard how painful they were, so understandably I was a bit nervous, as this was my first.The atmosphere was so peaceful and relaxing.She had me laughing and completely at ease. There was NO PAIN!!!!!!I won't go to anyone else!
