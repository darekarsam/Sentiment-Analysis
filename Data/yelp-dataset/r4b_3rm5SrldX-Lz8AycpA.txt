5	Love the fact that this Starbucks location on the active and always popular Rue St. Catherine's in the Village area has a foreign feel ("Cafe du Starbucks") as well as a Bohemian atmosphere Montreal's Village is famous for.  Even if you're not fluent in French, the employees make sure that your order is properly placed and that you feel welcomed. Highly recommended whenever you're Montreal for a week or a weekend.
5	Oh that I love this Starbucks! Purely amazing location, and great staff! When I come here, I usually like to sit down if I am ever lucky to find a table. You will usually find students siting with their laptops studying or you will find people just chilling out with coffees and talking with people.The coffees are hot, and always done right, you only need to wait a few moments if there is a line up because they work quickly. Highly recommended Starbucks with smiles guaranteed!
4	All and all I'd call this a decent Starbucks as they go. Location is cool, especially in the summer if you can find a spot on the terrace. Ste-Catherine being closed for the summer really adds something to the neighborhood.
4	Yea, Montreal. This is real coffee. We tried a Tim Horton's Glacee and seriously could not drink more then 2 sips. Pass on "roll up the rim", and sprint over to the Starbucks if you want to taste real coffee. Coffee, and location = 5 stars, but service was a tad slow.  American visitors may need to ask for more ice in the iced coffee if you want it like you get it at home.
