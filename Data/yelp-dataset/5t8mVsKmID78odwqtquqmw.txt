1	I bought kitchen cabinets from this store and had a horrible experience. The customer service is awful. Rob, the salesman/owner does not answer his phones, return emails and is very unorganized. My order was two weeks past promised delivery date and I wasn't even notified of the delay until the scheduled delivery date.  Worst of all it has been SIX months and I still don't have all the cabinets.  I ended up having to deal with the cabinet manufactuer to resolve all the problems!  Beware!
5	I had gone to Lowe's and Home Depot before coming here.  At Elegant, Richard and Robert's knowledge is far beyond what you get from the others and their prices were lower on superior cabinets (this was my biggest surprise as my assumption was that the big box stores would at least have the lowest prices).  My kitchen was delivered on time and the installation was perfect.  We ended up with excellent cabinets at a cost lower than I anticipated.  The entire process with Elegant exceeded my expectations.  Before you write a check to someone else, do yourself a favor and check with Elegant.
1	Please learn from my mistake - everything you are told at Elegant Kitchen cabinets is fiction. They promised delivery  in three weeks, it took seven,  and then not all cabinets/doors/ parts even arrived.Rob refuses to take my calls and is not willing to assist me in getting my kitchen complete. To make it all even worse my CC was over-charged and I am now disputing the substantial over charge.This is by far the worst customer service I have ever received.
1	Elegant Kitchen Cabinets made my kitchen remodel a total nightmare.
