4	Hooray!! This place saved the day!! My toddler needed a treat and they always deliver!! They have the best cookies ever. Love this place.They even have some amazing looking drinks..didn't dare try one but they sure look yummy.I know we loved our chocolate chip cookies!!Yummy!!
4	Well I finally gave in and tried one of the drinks. It was a tollhouse cookie drink. Yep I went there. Cookies in a cup. Brilliant.Sooo yummy. I enjoyed every slurp of it.Dont even wanna know how many calories were in that!
5	I really love their s'mores cookies! Tastes so delicious! I also tried the peanut butter and white chocolate macadamia cookies, they were also good. The guy who helped me was very polite and helpful.
2	Such a rip off. I ordered a baby ice cream sandwich (2 little cookies and a scoop of ice cream). It came out to be a little under $5. And on top of that, the worker dropped the ice cream scooper. I could tell he found it to be annoying that he had to go and pick it up from the ground and wash it by his long heaved sigh and his 2 second rinse under the faucet. I'm not coming back again.
3	So I have been here a few times, the smell of the cookies make it impossible to pass up!! But I am leaving a 3 star for the cookie cake I ordered. If i were rating everything else including service and prices I would give them  4 stars. In was very disappointed in the cake. It taste nothing like the cookies which are phenomenal( if you have a sweet tooth). Once it gets cold and is no longer fresh and I mean as soon as its done being made, it no longer taste good. The prices are good for the cakes but I would definitely prefer the cookies! They have buy 5 cookies get 1 free and a whole cup of mini chocolate chip cookies for 5.99!
4	Excellent cookies. I ordered a small white chocolate latte and it's very good. Lots of kids and a park with picnic benches and small tables with chairs. Wish there was a no-smoking enforcement though.
