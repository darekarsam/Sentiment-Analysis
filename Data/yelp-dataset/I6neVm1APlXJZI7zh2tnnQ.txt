5	They make thier own ice cream and chocolate - and it's all exceptional, possibly the best ice cream I have  EVER eaten! Had the chocolate and praline & cream, the p&c was the best "butter pecan" ice cream I have eaten my entire life. Amazing! Outstanding! Not to be missed!
5	Excellent chocolate.  Need I say more.  I am a chocoholic because of this shop.  Tip: try the chocolate ice cream.
5	The best hot chocolate I have EVER had.  It's an experience.  Do this as a special treat after a museum visit.  Your heart will race.
5	This place was my favorite while visiting Montreal. They've got great chocolate and to top it off, have the best cocoa! The service was great! Got offered water when she saw that I was about to have a sugar attack, good thing she did because I would have been bouncing off the walls.
3	This establishment is nice, but not spectacular. While they do carry a varied assortment of chocolates and other items, it's not impossible to find these elsewhere. If, however, you're in a bind, you can pretty easily be able to pick something from their selection.The drawbacks of this place are that the staff are not all that well versed in the products, and if they were, then it didn't really translate well across the counter. Second, a chocolatier should have available chocolate covered fruit, even a few (they require a 48 hour notice). This place is pricey, and does not accept all major credit cards (the cashier verbalized her extreme displeasure at the prospect of accepting certain cards). Overall, a rather mediocre experience.
