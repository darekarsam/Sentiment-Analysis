3	Had a coffee at this beautiful Moroccan cafe. The cafe it self is beautiful and very relaxing but the coffee wasn't very much to jump around for. With so many places starting to make coffee with passion and getting the knowledge on how to make a GREAT coffee, this is one thing they need to work on. The food looks nice though and I will come back to try it before any bigger review.
4	You probably have to know what to get but there's a few things on the menu that are pretty good and the prices are pretty low. I'm a fan of the lamb kofta tagine.They also do these shakes with spices and other sort of unusual ingredients for a shake/smoothie like pistachios and dates. They're really tasty if a little on the expensive side.Great place for Moroccan mint tea too.
