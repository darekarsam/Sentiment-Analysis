5	Excellent service! We dropped our PS3 off today to fix an issue with the red blinking light.  Their site says you get your equipment back in 3 days, but most of the time within 24 hours.  They called us not even 4 hours after we dropped it off saying it was fixed.
5	Our wii would not read any discs...took it in and they had it fixed that day! Much cheaper than buying a new/used one plus, all your data/miis/games are still there!! Great Job - Quick & Honest!
1	Drove all the way to sun city to find out this "business" is out of a garage?  And they warranty ?  Like how do I know you will be here in a year?  Needless to say did I not do business there wish I would have known as a waste of a drive!  Are the other reviews really true or written by owner you decide.

5	This place is out of a garage but his work is impeccable.He repaired my PS3 with the red light of death and warrantied it for a year. It did have the same problem 11 months later and he fixed it without any hassle what so ever. That was two years ago and my PS3 is still going strong.I have referred a few friends there and they loved his work and his prices. OH and Stephanie, I'm not the owner. Lol!
