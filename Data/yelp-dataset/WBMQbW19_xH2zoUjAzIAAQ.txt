3	Back when I lived in Pollock Halls in my first year at uni, Goodwill was the Chinese takeaway of choice.  It was recommended by a good friend of mine, and I was happy to partake in any food bought from here.Contrary to what my photo may suggest, they provide meals, and not 'eals' as they sign currently says.  They provide the normal range of Chinese dishes, and also a home delivery service.Whilst they might not be amazing in the culinary stakes, they are a convenient service that will hoover up a lot of student trade from the Newington area.  I don't normally go for Chinese as a takeaway preference, but Goodwill are a safe bet for some wholesome takeaway goodness.
1	This could and should have been the world's most convenient chinese takeaway for me during my first year of uni. But unfortunately it was about as far from that description as you can get.I don't want to be accused of making any slanderous allegations, but to put a long story short I've got ill both times I've eaten here, as have my friends. The first time, I will admit we'd had more than was healthy to drink, and so we put our illness the next day down to that, giving the Chinese takeaway the benefit of the doubt. After all, it was the Chinese takeaway that had given us hot food at 00:30 after we'd left the pub.The second time thought, we were a lot more dubious. The food was tasty, I will admit, but it's up to you if you're willing to risk spending the next two days in bed.
