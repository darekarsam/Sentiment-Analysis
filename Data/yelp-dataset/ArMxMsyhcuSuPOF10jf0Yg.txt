4	Bryant Street Market is a compact but surprisingly well-stocked grocery store located in the heart of Highland Park's small but suddenly fast-growing business district.In addition to having everything you'd expect from the proverbial corner store (boxes of mac n cheese, pints of ice cream), Bryant Street Market also stocks many healthier, fancier options (boxes of organic mac n cheese, pints of locally-made gelato). I was excited because I scored some Maruchan brand ramen noodles there, something I had been unable to do at a handful of Giant Eagle locations, or the nearby Target, all of which only carry the incredibly-misleading brand name Top Ramen.Bryant Street Market really has almost everything you could want or need  --  a wide variety of snacks and treats, an array of baking and cooking essentials, a full dairy case (with local farm-fresh eggs), organic fruits and vegetables, and a deli counter.The staff is pleasant and attentive. If you live in or around the Highland Park neighborhood, definitely give this place a visit.

I live just a couple blocks away, and I'm so grateful to have this little shop in my neighborhood. Also, the first time I went there, they hid a soft pretzel in my bag of honeycrisp apples, which was an awesome surprise when I got home. Thanks, BSM! :)
