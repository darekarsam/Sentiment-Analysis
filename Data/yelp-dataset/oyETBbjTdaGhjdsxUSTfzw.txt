3	Went to Villa Massimo twice and was satisfied both times. The seafood risotto was perfect. The service was great. Loved that old school Italian feel. The only down side is it is waaaay to expensive. Sure, all is good but you can get food like this in the city for half the price. But seeing that there aren't many places like this in the south shore, for a romantic evening without having to cross any of the bridge traffic, it's worth it.So, go and mangia, mangia!
5	We had a party of seven, all ordered something different and everyone thought their plate was the best. From Osso Buco to swordfish to vegetarian lasagne, we all shared tastes and all agreed it was excellent. The service and menu knowledge of the waiters was excellent. Not to mention the owner who walks from table to table chatting it up.We enjoyed everything about this restaurant.Visited July 2013
