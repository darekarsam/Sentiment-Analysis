4	A European style cafe - on the inside it is small, quiet, and clean. All Brioche is missing is a couple of smokers out front arguing over EU politics. I like the atmosphere here more relaxed than the other coffee spots in the area because it's not over-saturated with students.Coffee and tea are available all day. In the morning, breakfast sandwiches made with croissants, English muffins, eggs, cheese, and various breakfast meats. During lunchtime, there are baguettes available. Brioche also has plenty of baked goods including pastries and bagels.
2	I came here a month or so ago with my labmates for a quick lunch.  I ordered a bagel and a cup of mushroom soup.  While I was expecting them to be good, I was disappointed in the quality of food here.  The bagel was pretty nondescript and came with a small cup of Philadelphia cream cheese.  This surprised me, since if you order a bagel with cream cheese, most cafes usually put cream cheese on it--this smacked of laziness to me.  The soup was even more disappointing, as it was extremely salty, and there weren't any whole mushrooms in it (it was more like a puree).  This could be my Eastern PA bias here, but when I order mushroom bisque in PA, I expect it to be well seasoned and to have lots of tender, succulent mushrooms!  Given my experience with the bagel and the soup's taste, I'd be willing to bet that the soup was straight out of a can.  Call me crazy, but when I pay for lunch at a restaurant, I expect fresh food, not food that's frozen or straight out of a tin--and yes, this goes for chains, too!  I've also had pastries from here, and they've been disappointing as well, due to lack of flavor.  If you're in Oakland and are looking for lunch, give this place a pass and head over to Panera--or even better, Crepes Parisiennes on Craig.
