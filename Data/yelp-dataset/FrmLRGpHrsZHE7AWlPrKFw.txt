1	Their rental policy is very screwy. I used the unit from July 8 to Sep 9 and was charged 3 months rent. They only prorate your closing month if you move out by the 6th. Your better off going with anyone else. This is true of all Public Storages not just this location.
5	April was very pleasant to work with. Only dealt with her a few times but when I checked out of my unit, she remembered my name and had the paperwork done in a timely manner. Would definitely recommend.
1	Public Storage raised the fees by $30.00 per month. Instead of rewarding their loyal paying customers and keeping the rate the same for them and charging the fees to all new customers. Call corporate office... they don't seem to care. If my storage unit had A/C and a butler maybe but it's way to expensive for what you get plus you have to pay a mandatory insurance premium every month. Go elsewhere!!
