3	Friendly customer service!  I always stop in to buy a drink and/or snack when I stop here to get gas.  Consistently they stock their shelves with the products I enjoy.  Great selection of cold beverages and even little snacks from Mexico!  I also enjoy the coffee and more traditional American candy!  In terms of the car wash, I have to deduct points, because the colored foam was not working properly, and my boyfriend paid for the top car wash option, which included that colored foam.  Additionally, I have heard other customers complaining inside to the attendants about the shoddy job the car wash has done for their vehicles, and the attendants say that there is nothing they can do to offer a refund, since customers enter the car wash at their own risk.  Not the greatest attitude for the car wash, but everything else here is great!
4	Stopping by before went to tucson to this food mart. The food mart wasn't so big but it offers regular snacks and beverages that I need.
1	Don't know how anyone can give a good rating to this place. I haven't gone in years ...and it's my closest station....cause the service sucks....guess what it sill does .  Car wash does a lousy job.  Cashier basically accused me of trying steal $2 worth of gas trying to fill a gas can for my mower.
