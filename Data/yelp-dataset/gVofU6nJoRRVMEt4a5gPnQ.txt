4	I'm not an Indian food aficionado; however, I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner (take out). The staff was pleasant and attentive and prices are reasonable. I will make this place a regular lunch stop (buffet) and will  definitely return for dinner.  I just hope the building's curse doesn't affect this place like it has for the few restaurants that have been there before.
4	This is hands down the Best value for really good Indian food around hereThe food is fresh and superb and plentiful. The wait staff is very caring and attentive. I recommend this joint.

5	Haveli has beautiful decorations. The service is prompt and friendly. The food is wonderful and has an excellent spice to it. I have already been back here at least seven times . Thank you for coming to my neighborhood!
4	Really good Indian food. All staffs are Indians, and food tastes like Indians' foods, too. Environment is clean and bright, staffs are friendly. The curry dishes look smaller but actually they are enough to fill your hungry stomach. Average cost per person is about $20.
5	The food here is delicious!  We ordered the coconut naan as an appetizer and it came to the table piping hot. It was so good that I had difficulty not eating it all and filling up before our entrees arrived. For my entree I ordered the Lamb Masala, which arrived promptly. The portion of curry looked like it was going to be small but I actually had to take most of it home as it was deceivingly large.  Entrees were delicious.  The staff is very attentive and polite.  Most people can expect to spend about $20 a person for dinner.  I just moved to the neighborhood and this will be one of my regular dinner spots!
