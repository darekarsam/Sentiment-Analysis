2	Cheap. That's the key word. I'm here 5 weeks & total cost for hotel with tax is $1100. It's clean, but room is smaller than my dorm room in college. No luxeries for sure. But I'm basically sleeping here only so not the end of the world.
3	Its OK here for what it is. The rooms are small and walls thin but you  do have three choices for size which I think I will upgrade to next size. The rooms have a stove, sink and fridge. The flat screen TV is nice and WI fii comes in handy. If you choose to stay weakly plan on bringing your own bathing supplies which they do not replace after one towel, bar of soap,ext. I like the location because its off to the side not very a busy area. It does have a pool and laugh dry room which I will find out later how much that cost. Lets see we got a little bar steps away along with a bagel shop, circle K,  sonic,  car wash across the street. The reason I give this place 3 stars is because where its located and in walking distance of some good places. Prices are to much at $279.0 week plus 50 dollar deposit. O yea they clean once a week.
1	Zero RatingThis place is a dump. They are so pathetic, that they have vehicles towed from their parking lot adjacent to a bar!  Losers!!!!
