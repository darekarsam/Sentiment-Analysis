5	Andrea does a fabulous job cutting and styling my hair.  She has a good understanding of the type of cut that goes with the shape of your face.  I was so pleased with the way my hair turned out that I use a picture of me in that cut as the photo on my blog and other social media networking pages.  Andrea provides great customer service.  She does require payment in cash, so make sure you have that on hand,  If you bank at Wells there is one on the corner so it's easy to walk to from the salon.
5	What can I say? No more Great Clips for this guy! I've been going to Andrea for a few months now and she always makes me look fantastic. If Andrea isn't your stylist,  she should be.
