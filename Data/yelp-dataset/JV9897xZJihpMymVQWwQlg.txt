5	I spent over three months at Shadyside Hospital after a stem cell transplant.  I received excellent care there!!  All the doctors, nurses and fellows were dedicated, kind and compassionate.  My hospital room was spotless.  I would recommend both Shadyside Hospital and Hillman Cancer to anyone who might need them.  (Hopefully you never will.). The City of Pittsburgh and its surrounding area are deeply indebted to the Hillman family for providing the funding to build the Hillman Cancer Center facility and to UPMC for staffing the Center with the finest health care personnel, not to mention the state-of-the-art equipment and technology to provide cutting-edge care.
4	I've recently had a very good experience at the hospital for an endoscopy as well as a few follow up appointments with the gastroenterologist who did the procedure. Overall, I had a good experience at the hospital. For the procedure, unfortunately the procedure was about 2 hours late- for which I had to wait in a hospital stretcher for over two hours with an IV in my arm- however, everything else went smoothly and quickly. The doctor who completed the procedure, Lee Weinburg, was very nice and attentive with a good bedside manner. We had a good chat before and after the procedure. I would go to this hospital for future needs and be confident about the competency of the staff.
