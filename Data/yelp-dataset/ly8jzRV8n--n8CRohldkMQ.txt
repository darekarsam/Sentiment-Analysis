2	I wrote a review for this place that magically disappeared.Went in a few months back and took some take-out. It wasn't very good.Service was OK, price tag was too expensive for what it's worth.
4	I was surprised ! The food is very tasty. We tool a combination plate (beef , shrimp, rice, salad and spring roll) to be honest i liked everything. I cannot comment alit on service, the restaurant wasn't busy when we arrived  but was full before we left, the waitress was always smiling and very helpful, food came fast and vey well presented.  (Not the top in his style of food but definitely not like those all you can eat buffet or fast food Chinese). I  don't know how diverse is their regular menu , buy from my experience i would definitely recommend it.
