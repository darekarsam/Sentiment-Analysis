5	Holy record nerdiness! If you're a music geek, this is definitely a collector's paradise. Beach music lovers take note...they carry everything under the sun in that genre. Apparently, the owner started this out of the garage of his house but it soon turned into the Wax Museum. The two guys that run this place love music and it shows. Please show them some love, especially if you're into records and tapes. They carry some CD's as well but records and tapes are kings here. They also have some vintage posters and other music memorabilia as well. I could spend a lot of time and money here. Records start at 99 cents and above. Next time I'll bring a list so I'll know exactly what I'm looking for. It's fun to browse here though too.
5	The guys working here are friendly and very knowledgeable!  A customer was asking for music I had never heard of and not only did these guys know it they had it!  Some CDs, 45s and many 33 1/3 rpm Albums.  It was pretty cool seeing music I used to own on Vinyl and my friend had never heard of (well then we went to U.O. at South Park Mall and he showed me music I had never heard of also on Vinyl).  I have friends (under 20 years of age) who love the sound of playing these Vinyl records.
5	I feel conflicted while posting this review because it's such a gem of a find that you almost want to keep the knowledge of it a secret.  But this place deserves the kudos and business that comes its way.  One of the funnest (?) places I've 'dug'.  The Wax Museum has a cozy and dusty feel to it.  Great prices (somewhat negotiable if I remember correctly), cataloged appropriately, and a friendly dealer.  How often can you find that in a record shop?
