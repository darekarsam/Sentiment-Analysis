1	Our pizza was totally raw!  Completely disgusting and totally un-edible.  I would give 0 stars if I could.
3	You know what you're going to get: delivery/take-out pizza. I'm not expecting gourmet anything and I'm not disappointed.They're fast, efficient and consistent. I usually order online and pick it up -- the people behind the counter are always pretty friendly.
1	Ordered a large pizza with extra cheese for take out last night.  The pizza was smaller than most large sized pizzas. The crust was like cardboard and there was very little cheese. $15.00 for a very lousy pizza.
1	I ordered two large pizzas, one with extra cheese. The extra cheese pizza did not have any extra cheese.It had the same amount of cheese as the other pizza. I also ordered bread sticks. They were horrible. They were dry and no sauce was included with the sticks. The large pizza was small compared to other large pizzas. I found the pizza very similar to Dominoes but not as good.. I ordered on line for pick up, and they forgot to send me an e-mail to confirm or tell me when my pizza was done, so not only was it bad pizza but it was bad, cold pizza. I called the store and they said, "Oh yeah, your pizza is sitting here."  Where was my e-mail?  "Oh sometimes that happens, you don't get an e-mail or phone call with a time to pick up your pizza. Did I hear an "I'm sorry or even a credit to the order?" Noooo  Really bad customer service.  Not going back!
