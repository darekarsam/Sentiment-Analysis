4	This location was very busy but friendly customer service. Full stock store where I was able to purchase some great decore for the house. You can find items for bedroom including kids rooms, bath, kitchen and much more. There are always some super saver deals to keep some change in your pocket. I like this location.
5	Thanks again to the ladies working Sat 10/19/14. It's rare to find one employee that is willing to help when not related to a sale but ALL of the employees stepped up when I lost my purse. They checked their tape and let me know I didn't have it when I entered the store which helped me locate where I had left it. I will forever be grateful for the compassion they showed me and will be buying all my linens from Anna's from now on. You ladies are a great team!
