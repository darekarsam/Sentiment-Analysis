5	Funky little store that sells food and products "Fait ici" (Made here). Best gluten-free peanut butter cookies, cute kids and baby gifts, yummy mac & cheese (some days), and very big on everything organic, recycled and recyclable. A great place to stop for gifts or just a quick bite to eat. In the summer you can even sit in the small backyard patio.
