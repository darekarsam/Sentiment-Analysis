5	I must commend Angela Maycock for her outstanding service and fantastic attitude today. Extra Space had accidentally deleted my account in their system and I could not get in with my access code. Angela was great . . . she explained what had happened, apologized for her corporate colleague, and then proceeded to help me rectify the problem. She was diligent, helpful, but, most of all, pleasant to deal with. These are the kind of people that Extra Space Storage should hire more of, promote, give a bonus to, etc.  . . . Thanks, Angela!
