3	Just your typical small town post office. Service is always pretty quick & the lines aren't entirely too long. They have all your mailing needs along with post office boxes as well. So nothing special, just your typical post office.
1	My biggest complaint deals with packages coming into the facility from private carriers like FedEx. If you've ordered a package and this happens, expect to wait about a week for them to deliver the package. Two day shipping turns into a week and a half. Long, long wait in lines. No concern for your packages. Terrible delivery - drivers have crammed packages into my box causing damage. If you can afford to, go with UPS.
1	This has to be the worst company in the world..how are they still in business..customer services like Dealing with a zoo.. Nobody takes responsibility for anything.. Please therefore  do not ship any package USPO.. And why as a public are we worrying about them privatising the mail.. Remember public word-of-mouth is everything I was I would have known about the services before hand .. Now I know & will be speeding  the world to everyone I know. To avoid using the post office by all means.. Pay your bills online they offer fee money orders @ some money cash place. I hope this help someone before it's two late for them
