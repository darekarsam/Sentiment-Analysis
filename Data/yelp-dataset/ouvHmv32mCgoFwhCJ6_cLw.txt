5	I recently started an exercise routine to loose weight but was stopped after my foot starting hurting! I couldn't understand why it hurt so bad.  So when I went to Dr. Hunchak, he took the time and patience to explain it to me in a way I could understand, and he told me what to do to make it better.  That was last month and now I can say I am PAIN FREE, and back to exercising.  Go see the doctors at Westland! They are great!
5	Squeaky orthotics and foot discomfort prompted me to seek out this office in order to get my orthotics replaced.  It was a great experience from beginning to end.  I got an appointment quickly, was fitted for my orthotics on the same appointment, and came back a few weeks later to pick them up.  They were also kind enough to find out the most cost effective option for me (going through insurance vs. not going through insurance).    I saw Dr. Whitney and she was extremely personable.  I can't yet speak to the quality of the new orthotics because I just got them but so far, so good!
5	amazing doctors, they really take the time to explain everything to me...now we have a great treatment plan and I'm soooooo happy I'm getting the best treatment! My pain is gone!!!! Couldn't recommend more!
