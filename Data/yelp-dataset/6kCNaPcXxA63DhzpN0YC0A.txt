5	5 stars for the drinks & desserts.  Seriously, I LOVE happy hour and the blend that Sonic has for their sodas.  Food might be a different story if I were rating that.
3	Great french toast sticks, great happy hour drinks!!I dont like the ice cream here, I guess I am more of a dairy queen lover. I also have had mixed feelings about the burgers here, Sonic can just rock on day and fall of a cliff the next. The fries can either be hard or soggy, burgers can either have no taste or soggy bread or yucky lettuce. I have since stopped getting burgers from Sonic. I stick to only the drinks and breakfast.
5	Love sonic & the happy hour specials!
2	Had a  bad experience last night our order wasn't even close to being correct, they mixed up everything even after I asked twice at the window if they had it right. Really bad when they can't get a cheeseburger right.
