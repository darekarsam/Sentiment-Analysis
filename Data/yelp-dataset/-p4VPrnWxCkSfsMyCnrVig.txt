4	I HATE GOURMET PIZZA. Pizza should not have shiitake mushrooms or arugula, because that's not a pizza.Thankfully, Zappy does not serve this crap. They serve what I call, and I mean this as a compliment, Dirty Greek Pizza. If you live in Montreal you know what I mean. Most pizza places are old and dirty looking, you probably wouldn't eat there and as with most restaurants in Montreal are owned by Greeks. And they simply make the best tasting pizza. The one you can rely on when you order out. It's gonna be thick, tasty and packed with cheese. Bread and lots of cheese, it what we all love. Thrown in the salty goodness of cheap peperoni and you got yourself some pizza heaven.Being new to Verdun this is where I'll be getting my Pizza until something better comes along.
3	This place is becoming my cheap-and-cheerful go-to place in Verdun. When I don't feel like cooking, I can go and get a decent feed for just a few dollars.The servings are definitely North American sized - and that's just on the specials menu (the 'normal' menu servings are even bigger!). They have a really wide range of items on the menu, which is great for when you're not even sure what you want to have (all you know is that you don't want to make it yourself OR wash up afterwards). I think my favourite so far is the pita gyros (it comes with fries and a salad).Don't go expecting to have a culinary awakening, and you'll be fine. Zappy wins in PRICE and SIZE of their servings (and because their logo is a kangaroo).
3	Keeping in mind that this place is purely cheap and easy food - pizza and deep fried stuff. The pizza is good. I used to order from them all the time - for delivery. They had good trios, and it was decent.However they DO NOT deliver their food anymore and you have to eat in their restaurant. So I guess I am no longer a patron. :P
