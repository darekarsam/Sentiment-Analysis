4	The Cameron Toll Shopping Centre can be criticised for a lot of things, but when it comes to birthday cards, it actually has two of the best shops that I have seen. The Card Factory, actually gives better deals than you can get in here, but the quality of cards here are better. As I have expressed in the review of The Card Factory, I actually hate birthday cards and just don't know why we can't simply wish someone a happy birthday through phone and why we insist on buying a card, that will undoubtedly be thrown out the next day. Shops like Paperbox and The Card Factory however, certainly do make it a lot cheaper when it does come to conforming to this custom.This shop is in a different league to Clinton's and Birthday's, it sells cards at the prices they should be, after all they are just made out of card with a few bits of ink on it here and there.
