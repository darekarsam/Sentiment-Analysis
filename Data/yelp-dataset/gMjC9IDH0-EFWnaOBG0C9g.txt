1	I have been having a very unpleasant experience with this business. There is a thing called a trade association where businesses buy and sell things to each other on barter. The owner of this location is a member and I have been trying to work with them for several weeks to get some print work done on trade but he has not responded to any emails or messages left and I was told I was emailing the owner. I can understand missing one or two emails but about 5 emails and messages left over the period of 2 weeks with multiple staff members at the store saying I need to talk to the owner but he never responds. They also have a 10 day lead time on getting any business cards or print work done which would be okay but add that to the 14 days now since I originally sent the work over and you're looking probably a month to get something done, very unprofessional. I know this is not an isolated incident because I tried to ask questions in May via email and never got a follow up response to my questions. I had to call the store and track down the owner. I wish I can comment on their quality of work but if this is how the owner treats customers I would stear clear of them.
1	Horrible customer service. I was literally hung up on while trying to get pricing for my clients. Avoid this printer at all costs. They do not understand customer service, I am extremely angry and offended.
1	Very disorganized and rude. lost my order and try to blame it on me, I went down to the location to show him my confirmation email and he still tried to say it was my fault the order was not in his system. The Tempe location is absolutely amazing, use them if possible!!!!
