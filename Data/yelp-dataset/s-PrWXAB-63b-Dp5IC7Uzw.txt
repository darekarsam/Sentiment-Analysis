4	best ribs in the city. two excellent sauces.
4	Z-Best is a really good place!They have two other locations. This location is in the Garfield section of the city. They offer ribs, chicken wings, wing dings, fish sandwiches, gyros and select deli sandwiches.For sides they offer baked beans, cabbage, coleslaw, greens, green beans, mac & cheese, potato salad and sweet potatos.The service is fast and friendly. Note that this is a take out only location. The ribs are tasty and tender. The sides are good too. Z-Best is a worthy contender however, Showcase in Homewood is still the king of ribs in Pittsburgh.
4	This place has some of the best ribs I've ever had. They had me comatose for hours. I didn't eat for almost 24 hours after I had half a rack of these. I can't even begin to describe the delicious sauce they're smothered in or how their tender goodness falls of the bones with a slight touch. This place YUM!
