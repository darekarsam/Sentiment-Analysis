1	Horrible food
5	Not sure what Shane K had to eat but all I have to say Twice The Deal Pizza is probably the best pizza I've ever had.  It never fails!  The prices are great, they are really fast and also nice people to deal with.  Would recommend this place to anyone!
4	Their pizzas are incredibly cheap. Walk-in deal of $7.99 for an xtra-large 1-topping pizza. Best value is if you and a friend order one of these and split it. Their pizzas taste a lot better if you tell them to add extra tomato sauce. Otherwise, I find it to be closer to cardboard (e.g like Campus Pizza) if you don't get the extra sauce.
