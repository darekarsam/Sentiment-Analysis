4	Brownlee is a local jeweler that's been in the Charlotte area for many years.  They have mostly small stores and are more of a small town jeweler that has repeat customers that they've had for years.....now just because they're small doesn't mean the prices are cheap.  It's a nice place for a bracelet, ring, watch or watch battery, etc.  I have purchased several rings from them over the years and never had any problems and found the quality to be pretty darn good.  I usually go to have my rings cleaned and to browse for sales.  I'm actually surprised they've survived in this economy, so I guess they're doing something right.
1	It is amazing what constitutes customer service these days. I needed a new setting for my 1 1/2 carat blue diamond as it has gotten loose. The clerk not only appeared put out that I needed assistance but also proceeded to condescend and ask if I knew the difference between a ring and a setting. Never going to a Brownlee's again.
5	Patrick and Collin helped me for the past 9 months to pick that perfect setting and diamond for my bride to be. Brownlee Jewelers is the perfect place to buy all my jewelry. I want to thank Patrick and Collin with having patience with me with all my ups and downs of choosing the perfect ring.
