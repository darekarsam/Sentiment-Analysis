3	Just like any other KFC but they do have a lunch buffet. Right now they're building a gas station next door so theirs only one way in and out and the driveway is kinda narrow. The one downside is that their menu outside is not up to date. So u order one thing and their like "we don't offer that n e more". Well come outside and update ur menu it's not rocket science...smh
3	Lunch buffet from 11am to 3pm for $7.35.  Nice!  Only had two kinds of chicken (roasted and original).  Had a lot of sides.  Nothing special but gets the job done when you are hungry and looking for quick, cheap food.  Since it's close to where I live, I"ll probably be back, but wouldn't go out of my way for it :)
4	This is a pretty cool location. The entrance from the street is down a huge hill, into the parking lot and drive thru. But there are plenty of parking spaces once you make it down. And since the location is relatively "new" from the outside it looks clean and well kept.  I haven't been inside yet, so this review is strictly based on the drive thru.My experience was great!  I already knew what I wanted so it didn't take me long to order. I keep it simple with a two piece-white meat with potato wedges and corm. The cashier was very perky and upbeat. When I arrived at the window, she was just smiling and had an excellent attitude. It's so rare to find perky, happy people at the drive thru windows. So that definitely made my visit!  To top it off my order was hot and prepared correctly, and of course it tasted great. A bonus for this location is that they have a lunch buffet! I will have to make sure I check it out one day!
1	REAL disappointed in this location.  Had been a couple times to the buffet and came from downtown Charlotte for lunch 30+ minutes, easily passing 10 KFCs on my way to this location only to learn THEY NO LONGER HAVE THE BUFFET FROM 12-3.  I left and I won't be back.
