5	We were here while on a mini vacation. From the outside, this restaurant is small and does not have much advertisement on the outside, and it was a little confusing to enter since there is a huge vegan restaurant right next to it, but once we got in, it was well worth it! The food was unique, beautiful in its presentation and absolutely delicious. We were there with a party of 6 people and everyone found something on the menu to suit their taste. The staff was very attentive, knowledgeable and polite. The crepes are available in buckwheat flour option, which are delicious! I would highly recommend this restaurant.
5	Great service and amazing food! It seemed a little silly of me to order eggs benedict at a creperie with so many creative and delicious options, but I am very glad i did! The best eggs benny ive ever had, and thats saying quite a lot ( i eat a lot of eggs benny :P). The staff are very attentive and are  looking to please. Very clean and modern, look gives out the perfect vibe for a nice relaxing breakfast/ or whatever meal youre eating. I will definitely be back and highly recommend going!
5	The food was great! The portions are quite large and the price is very affordable as well. I will come again for sure.
