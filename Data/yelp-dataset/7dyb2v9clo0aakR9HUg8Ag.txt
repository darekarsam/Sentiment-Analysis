3	I like this place for the most part, most of the staff members are nice besides this one guy that always seem to be mad about something very unprofessional. I go  there 5 days a weeks so its like a second home.
5	Excellent place:) they have a nice massage bed and you can't beat the health insurance plan.. this gym pays for itself.  Love it!
4	Lunk Alarm!  I used to spend my better years getting jacked up and eating protein shakes like it was my job.  Then I found beer. Unfourtunately Beer had caused me to get fat and stop going to the gym.  So it was time to find a new gym to workout.  Around here I used to go to Gold's and the Y.  I personally loved the Y and it was one of the best places gyms I have been to. Though I didn't feel like spending over $55 a month.  Planet Fitness is setup exactly like most Gold's Gyms.  They also almost have the same machines.  The difference?  About $40 a month.  I have heard that you can't put much weight on the machines or the bars and this is a lie.  You can definitely rack that up.  You can do deadlifts which was another myth.  There are only 3 negatives.  Dumbells only go to 85 lbs, you cannot do lift, clean, and places, and there are no Squat racks.  It sucks there are not squat racks and probably the only thing I miss.  They do have 3 smith machines though.  Overall great gym at a great price.  This location has a lot of equipment so you rarely have to "weight". So far after a few months I am happy.
5	This is my spot! I love Planet Fitness. It's definitely the best gym I've been a member of. The Freedom Drive is my home gym but I also travel a lot & test out the P.F.'s on the road. They're all awesome. Great equipment, mucho TV choices, massage chairs, & tanning! For $20 a month? ...so yeh...I like the place. & they have tootsie rolls.
