5	Great store, excellent customer service. Pretty neat and clean considering the area. They really know what they are doing, also provides sevices for NV corporations. Unlike most others, takes the time to thoroughly go through process with you and keep you up to date with requirements!
5	Their service has been wonderful. Very accommodating and very personable too, as we've made it a main place to get flyers printed out for our shows. And a terrific staff there that works with you!
5	I've had accounts with four different UPS Stores over the years and this one is as good as it gets. The staff is AMAZING and really excel at customer service and making you feel like one of the family. Eric is about the friendliest, best employee you could hope for. I'd highly recommend them.
5	These guys are the best! I'm always coming to them in a panic because I need something printed right away. They are very helpful and their pricing is better than most places in Vegas.
