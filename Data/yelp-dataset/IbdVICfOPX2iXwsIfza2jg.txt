4	Service counter clerks are very friendly and helpful.
4	This is my first time actually purchasing the paint with Dunn-Edwards.  I have heard about this place through the painters that repainted our house few years ago that they purchased the paints through them.  If you do live in a Homeowner Association home(s), just provide your association name to them and most likely you will get some soft of a discounts on all the purchases.  Good luck!
1	Over 200$ for a 5gallon bucket of exterior flat paint ?   I DO NOT think so.  Sorry.                   Last three times there my colors were off tint.  Had to return with poor service.  I'll shop Frazee now.    Sorry.  Dunn.
1	These guys make it very clear they don't like working with home owners. Short answers with an attitude is a typical Dunn Edwards response. Frazee is right down the road and they are fine working with contractors or home owners.
2	I was disappointed I could not return paint I was trying to match to existing walls. This wasn't explained at checkout. Would not return simply for the dismissive way I was treated when I tried to return it was a pint). There was no attempt to make any reconcilliation. Agree they did not seem to want my business
2	I love designer Jeff Lewis's aesthetic and was thrilled when he came out with his own line of paint. Fortunately or unfortunately the only place that you can purchase it directly from a retail location is at Dunn-Edwards. I haven't had horrible experiences there in the past but this time you would have thought that I had the secret super power of invisibility because I stood there for 10 minutes without any type of acknowledgement. I finally just grabbed a color card and left.
