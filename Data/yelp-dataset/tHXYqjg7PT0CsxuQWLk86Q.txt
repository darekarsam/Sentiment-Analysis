5	Dr. Ravi and her entire staff is incredible. I cannot say enough great things about this practice. Wonderful, friendly, accommadating. Each and every time we go, it's a pleasant experience. My kids run into their office they love the staff so much and the ease of getting an appointment when you need one is fantastic. One Saturday our daughter was developing a rash and I called the after hours lines. Dr. Ravi called me back within minutes and asked me if we could meet her at the practice within 15-20 minutes. She took time away from her family and treated our daughter. Incredible service! We've been to two other pediatrician practices and I won't take my children anywhere else. If you live in the NW Peoria/Glendale are and are looking for a great pediatrician, I highly recommend this practice!
5	We have seen many of their doctors but Dr. Osborn is the absolute best!! She has been so amazing to my two girls and my 3 yr old gets excited to go there to see her.y 3 yr old talks about Dr. Osborn at home all the time and loves her. The staff are wonderful at both locations and very friendly. Have had to make a lot of appointments and they are so accommodating and wonderful. I would recommend them to anyone.
5	I am very impressed with this place! I've bounced around to several differed ped offices around town and never was truly satisfied until I came here. The doctors actually sit down and talk to you! Wait times are very short and the doctors are not rushed. They even make a point to follow up on you with your major concerns and encourage you to call the office if anything else comes up.They are also pretty natural friendly here which is a plus. So far we've seen Dr. Ravi, Dr. Osborne and PA Liz here and all were wonderful! My son loves coming here!
