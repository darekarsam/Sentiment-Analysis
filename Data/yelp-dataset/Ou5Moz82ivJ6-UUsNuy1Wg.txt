2	Located in the lobby of the Hilton Suites in downtown Phoenix, I was fully unimpressed with their hotel restaurant. In contrast to the beautiful atmosphere of the restaurant, the food was pretty lousy.  From my room I could just smell the bacon in the morning so I had to come downstairs and give this place a try.  The restaurant is buffet style for breakfast.  The food was barely warm and hard as a rock.  The quality of the food was much worse than the free breakfasts that come complimentary at other hotel chains such as La Quinta.  At least the service was good.  I think they refilled my drink after each sip I took!  They must have known I was going to need it to wash that food down.I'll give 2 stars only because the service was great and the atmosphere was pleasant.

1	Stayed in the hotel for a conference and did not feel like going out to eat. Ordered the caprese salad. Pretty safe bet, right? 5 tiny cubes of mozzarella with 3 cherry tomatoes.  I also ordered the buffalo wings. It was hard to describe the texture but imagine if the chicken had been soaking in water all day and then put in the fryer for 30 seconds. It was weird and mushy and made me question the safety of eating it. The ranch dressing that came with it was also so watery that it dripped off of the carrot stick so that only a thin whitish film remained.  I ordered a side of arugula because I like to eat it with my caprese salad. This was good thinking because it ended up being the only (sort of) substantial thing I ate that night.Service was great, though. Less than a 10 minute walk away is Switch Restaurant, an IHOP and a bunch of other places. Eat there instead.
