3	This Wells Fargo Bank is located at the corner of Thomas and 44th St, which is a very busy intersection, not making it the easiest to enter.  The building was renovated a few years ago and now has a very modern looking exterior.  There is one drive though ATM, one on the side of the building and one inside.  This Wells Fargo is very large, but is almost always busy.
3	Not a Wells Fargo Bank customer, but just want to use their ATM to see how much time I would spend getting my money.  I was fairly impressed.  In and out of the bank in under 5 minutes.
1	Have never been accosted at the door by an over-eager banker (?) before, trying to"introduce me to me wells fargo services".  Personal bubble dude!  Inconvenient location, very cramped and busy parking lot. I've been a wells customer for over 10 years, and I can tell you, I would have taken my money and run years ago if they were all like this one.
1	What an awful bank. To simply cash a check, you have to wait over 20 minutes for the desk clerk to verify funds and get FINGERPRINTED. Next, you have to wait 10 minutes more through the teller line, only to get treated like a criminal. On top of that, you get to pay them a $7.50 fee for the privilege of going through all that hell.
2	I've never gone inside this branch, but regularly use the ATMs because the location is close to where I often am anyway.  However, it's a real pain to get in and out of the place due to the way it's situated on the corner.  If traffic is heavy, forget it.  I only use this location if I'm not going to be driving by another one.
