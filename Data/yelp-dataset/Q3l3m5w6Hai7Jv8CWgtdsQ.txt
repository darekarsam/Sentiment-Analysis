5	Clean,and manager makes sure there is no trouble.  Beat us staying in Phoenix and putting up with a drive.
1	Unless you are looking for a sweat lodge, you'll want to avoid this place, at least in the summertime. Management boasts of the new central air units ( they looked new) but I held up a Bic lighter right on the air duct and it barely made the flame waiver, much less blow out the flame. We got there around 9:00pm it was still around 100 degrees outside and 90 degrees in that room. At the rate that Air was blowing it would have taken all night, if not longer, to cool that room. There are no working phones in the room so if you want management you either use your cellphone or walk to the office. For just a few more $$$ we stayed at the Day's Inn out on I-10, which had its issues too, but had a great hard-blowing air conditioned. I did get a refund.
4	I stayed twice this season in this hotel, it is great! I went in July, we were at the beginning and at the end of 05 days, Rose has a name manager who is great, personalized service. Well located, close to many shops and restaurants also turn to Arlington, AZ is where we will stay. When we left on August 1, 2013, was starting a major renovation, will get better still, big room, and very beautiful. The second time we had a super discount and love, very good! We will return often and go to this hotel!
