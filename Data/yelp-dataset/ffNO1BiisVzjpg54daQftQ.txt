5	TIna is the number one best waxer I've ever gone too. She uses very high quality products and is meticulously clean. I am very prone to ingrown hair but have not had a single one since I began seeing Tina. Seriously, you won't find a better esthetician to go to!
5	If your looking for the a truly exceptional esthetician, look no further; Tina is amazing! She is professional, honest and a wonderful people person. She is very knowledgeable & knows exactly what she's doing.  She takes the time to explain different procedures & then recommends what she thinks would be best for you. She is honest, her prices are great, her room is very cozy & is decorated so well that I want to steal her butterflies (that alone should be reason enough to give her a try LOL  Her bed is comfortable & she has a blankie & a warming pad (wonderful!) She is meticulous about her work & takes her time to make sure that you are satisfied. A true pro. Since I started going to Tina, all of my friends have been telling me how great I look.  She is the ABSOLUTE BEST IN THE BUSINESS!Her work should come with a warning! I am officially addicted to Tina & how great she makes me look!
