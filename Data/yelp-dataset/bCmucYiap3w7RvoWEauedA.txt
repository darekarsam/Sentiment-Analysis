5	Great customer service.  Great flower arrangement  over all A++++++ I am telling everyone about them.  Awesome florist
5	Great service! I've used this florist multiple times. If you have them saved in your speed dial your life will be much simpler. All I do is make a 5 minute call saying that I want a flower arrangement for $__ and where I want it delivered, what I want not to say and it gets there same day! All my clients have loved their arrangements: fresh flowers and creative designs!
5	What an amazing experience! They have so much adorable(+affordable) stuff there and beautiful flowers! The owner Barbie is a joy and so helpful. Love supporting local businesses like this! I will be telling everyone i know about this hidden gem :)
5	I ordered a boutinaire. The customer service was great. They took the time to ask the smallest of details so it would be perfect! We have a family florist now! I wont order anywhere else! Thank you!
