1	The building is nice and new but thats about it. The administration is horrible, and players. They can change the rent, the terms and conditions within a day. On day one you agree with them on a rent? On day 2 you gather the paper they need go to rent, they ask for more money. Worst administration i ever dealt with in montreal
5	This is one of the best buildings in Montreal!!!! 4 swimming pools, spa, sauna, steam room, rooftop terrace and game room.I would disregard Eli W.'s review because I think he made an error, it is not a commercial building but a private residential one so there is no administration or rental office so it makes no sensehttps://www.airbnb.ca/rooms/1594063
5	My wife and I stayed at Le Seville through an Airbnb rental and we absolutely loved it.  This place is amazing. We both really enjoyed our stay here.This place was just built about a year ago, so everything is new. Its only two blocks from Atwatter Metro Station and it has a Starbucks and Adonis supermarket in the same building which we both used almost daily.  The condominium has 4 rooftop pools with BBQ Grills, tables, and beautiful views of Montreal. They also have a nice Fitness Center with a sauna, hot tub, and steam room.They also have a lounge area on the 20th floor which overlooks the entire city. This place seems to be soundproof. We didn't  hear any street noise and it's located on a busy part of St Catherine. I'm not a Canadian citizen, but if I was I would really look into living at this place.So if you're able to live here, you want regret it. If you just staying in town for a while, there are some tenants that have rentals on Airbnb.  If you want the Airbnb listing that I rented from, just PM me and ask.
