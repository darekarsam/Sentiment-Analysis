1	the worse place I have ever been to. It is located inside a run down gas station. The place has a feel of Texas chainsaw massacre.  Inside, the place was equally horrific as the outside. There is no way I would send my dog there ever again.
4	I have been very happy with Dawg Days.  The outside is not attractive but the inside is very dog friendly.  We've been taking our dog to get his hair cut there for over a year.  We used to take him to Pet Smart, who nicked him with the razor on 2 occasions and sent us home with a bleeding dog and not a word of explanation.  Dawg Days is family owned, and they genuinely care about the dogs, and when our dog gets nervous, they don't traumatize him.  We just got a second dog and he was terrified of the razor, so they gave him a haircut by HAND and didn't charge us any extra.  They keep the dogs in an open pen indoors and don't lock them in metal crates.  The staff is frequently in with the dogs giving them love and attention.  Our dog is afraid to walk into Pet Smart, but in the last year has never become afraid of Dawg Days, and has never come home bleeding.  It's hard, but don't judge this place by the outside, we have been very happy with their services.
5	I went to Emily to have my shih-tzu Mila groomed at the east side location and I am IN LOVE with her haircut. She did such a great job and my dog felt very comfortable with her. I also took my chihuahua Lily to get her nails trimmed and she did great as well!! Usually she wont let me touch her feet but she sat great for Emily! I will definitely be taking my dogs back to her and this place! Highly recommend! :)
