1	So I got a new flyer in the mail and saw this place had real gyros so I decided to give it a shot. Bad decision. So I ordered 4 gyros, plain,  with sauce on the side. They said 1/2 hr. To 45 minutes. An hour later, it take 10 minutes drive from my house, and if you ever bought a gyro from a gyro shop you know it takes about 1-2 minutes to make 1, and what I got was 4 plain gyros, no sauce, and 5 small pieces of meat on each large size pita. We called and told the owner about forgetting the sauce and commented on the size. The said don't worry he would send 4 new ones with the sauce and to return the others. Once again 1 hour later, 4 got 4 gyros with the sauces and 6 pieces of meat on each. Thanks for "taking" care of it. Total waste of time and money. You could have taken the meat from 3 and made 1 gyro from Mike & Tony's on liberty ave. And the sauce was some crappy store bought stuff. Will not order from again. Buyer beware!
