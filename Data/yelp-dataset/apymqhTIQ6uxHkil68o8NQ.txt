5	I recently had SharpShine Professional Automobile Detailing perform a platinum package on my 2007 Audi. I was amazed on how they were able to make it look like new again. Their team of professionals are very meticulous and thorough. Keep up the great work!!
5	My neighbor referred me to SharpShine about a year ago and now I take advantage of their convenient at-home auto detailing whenever my Escalade gets dirty! (So awesome not to have to leave the house and struggle with the car wash process!) I have three super-messy kids and my car gets SO GROSS (kid dirt, juice spills, dog hair, etc!!), but the guys at SharpShine never cease to amaze me with their attention to detail and ability to take my vehicle from sad to PRISTINE in no time! It takes a lot to make me happy in that department as I'm a total neat freak! Their prices are reasonable and they are always accommodating with my baby's nap schedule and very courteous, professional, and friendly. I don't know how Manny survives in the hot weather working as hard as he does! He is a magician! We LOVE SharpShine and I rave about them to everyone I can :)
5	Sharpshine is hands down is the most excellent detailing company that I have used in arizona. There quality of work along with affordability is simply the best.
5	I had detail job that needed a lot of work and after shopping around, chose here. I couldn't be happier with my choice. Great work and was able to clean and polish everything. Highly recommended and will use moving forward.
5	Sharpshine did a fantastic job on my car! It hasn't looked this good in years. I highly recommend them to anyone who wants their vehicle to look amazing and be incredibly clean.
5	I love Sharpshine!  I don't even have to leave my home to get 5 star customer service and 5 star quality.  Manny is great and really goes above and beyond.  This is a great company with great people!  Thank you,  Sharpshine!  :)
