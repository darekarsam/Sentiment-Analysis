5	Great Gym!  i love this place
4	I love 9 round!  This is a great concept to add to any fitness routine, especially if you are one that suffers from being "bored" while working out.     So, just like the name states, you have 9 rounds to complete in 30 minutes.  Each round is 3 minutes and there is a 30 second "active rest" inbetween rounds.  Each round combines cardio, core and strength so you are ensured a total body workout.  This is somewhat of a "kickboxing fusion" concept so at a few of the rounds you put your boxing gloves on and go to town on a punching bag!  It is actually quite refreshing and a great way to release tension after a long day at work!  The stations change every day so you are constantly "tricking" your body which is a great way to see results.  You will  see a variety of moves like jump roping, squats, burpees, planks, roundhouse kicks, various punches, pushups, dips, etcThis is a great place for all fitness levels.  The trainers challenge you along the way or they can modify if you have any injuries.  Everyone is super nice, the music is fun and the workout is awesome!!  Give them a try!  This is a very affordable way to get a very personalized workout that will meet all fitness goals!
5	Love it!! Everyone is awesome.  Always a different workout every time.  It great there is no set time for class you just jump right in and start at the bell.
