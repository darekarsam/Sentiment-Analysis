4	We were looking for sushi and super hungry.  This is the first place we saw on our drive, so we pulled over.  It was pretty much empty, I think one other customer at the bar... which is usually a bad sign, but we decided to go for it anyway.  Clearly based on the menu and the interior, this is a take-out or delivery place (do they deliver?).  But we decided to eat in.  Got a bunch of the regular rolls. California, Rainbow, Tuna, Shrimp, etc...  Service, almost non-existent.  We had to walk over to give them our orders.  They brought the food.  We walked over to pay. The food itself was surprisingly pretty good.  Maybe we were hungry and maybe my expectations were pretty low, but it actually surprised me.  Everything was fresh.  The fish was cut pretty thin.  The sushi didn't fall apart and everything was proportionally right on.  I probably wouldn't come back here to eat-in, but for take-out or delivery this place would definitely be a winner.
