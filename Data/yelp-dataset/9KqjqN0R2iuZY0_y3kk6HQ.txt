5	About 4 years ago we enrolled our daughter in this school very apprehensively because all the buildings were manufactured housing at the time, but we'd heard good things and the school she was at was soooo bad. Well, 4 years later with 3 kids now making their way through, I must say I'm impressed. It is not easy and there is a TON of homework, but compared to the traditional schools in the area, it's not even close. The quality of education is excellent and with the exception of one 3rd grade teacher (which unfortunately we've had twice now) the educators are amazing.
5	Best school in Arizona. Staff of the schools is very friendly and think out of the box to teach kids. We love this school.
5	We absolutely love this school.  My son was bullied for over a year at another school Which ended up with my son having emotional behavior problems and hating school.  We tried everything and that school just gave up on my son without addressing the base problem.  Since we have started at this school my son has done a complete 180. He is behaving and loving school again.  The staff is understanding, supportive and caring.  They really came and saved the day.  I would highly recommend this school to any parent from any background or situation. They are the best and help students go far and beyond as a citizen and In academics.
