5	This location in Mesa off of Main Street is not a store, but a place to pick up your purchases from their massive Scrapbook website. The wonderful thing about it is if you live in Mesa you don't have to pay for shipping. Www.Scrapbook.com is most likely the best scrapbooking website on the Internet at this time. Not only do they have huge amount of products, but they have huge gallery to get ideas from. They also have YouTube videos for how to use their products and create wonderful pages. When you pick up your items, you always get a free product. The staff at the Main Street pick up site are always friendly and outgoing and you get your order within minutes of arriving there.  I will always be loyal to scrapbooking.com, because they treat their customers with respect and have great products.
5	Nice products. Occasionally pricey compared to the not so wonderful corporation Hobby Lobby. My review mainly is for the return policy. I ordered lots of stuff for my wedding, and then I went on my honeymoon without returning what I did not need. 60 day return policy! So easy to return too.  Just for that I will order more from them because I don't feel pressure to decide how to craft in a limited time period. Keep up the good customer service!
