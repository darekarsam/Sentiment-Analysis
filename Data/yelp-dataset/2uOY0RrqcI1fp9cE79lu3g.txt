4	This is a cosy, little cafe a short walk from the Atwater Market.  It serves up delicous food at very reasonable prices so you really can't go wrong in coming here.   They serve up your classic breakfast food and it is well done.  I'm a fan of their potatoes which are well-seasoned.The service is a little on the slow side but that's because they don't have a big kitchen and there is only one cook.  That being said it's not that bad because while your food can take it's time the waiter is still coming around and topping up your coffee so you don't feel like you've been forgotten as is usually the case with slow service.
1	If you're hungover: GO! If you're sober: No.Straight up greasy spoon/ diner food. Questionable quality. You get the idea.
