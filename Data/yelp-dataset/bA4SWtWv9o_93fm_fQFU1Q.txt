5	It's the moment every little girl dreams about....the day when her own prince charming gets on one knee, with a little box and asks her to be his forever.I've been fortunate enough to find the guy I want to do that, and he took me ring shopping the other day.  This is one of the locations we went too.Staff was very nice, they listened to what you want, and tried to help you think through different options.  Although we told them we were just looking at this point, they still took time to sit and talk with us for over 30 mins.  Impressive.  (a lot of places hear, we're just looking, and act like they no longer have time for you.)They lady we talked with was named Heidi.  She is one of their gemologist on staff and she knows her stuff.  Although their prices tend to be a little more high end than you might find elsewhere, you are paying for good quality work.  And they are willing to work with you within your budget.Although we are still looking at what we want.  This is definitely a place we will keep in mind.
5	Donald Haack Diamonds is an amazing store with an amazing staff.  Not only is the selection unbelievable, but the staff is so knowledgeable and really take their time to figure out exactly what you want.  They will even set you up with a wish list.  The next time your significant other wants to get you something nice, they can come by the store and get the list of items you have picked out.  I appreciate the fact that you never feel pressured.  It was an all around great experience and I would highly recommend them!
