1	*sigh*  :/ Why oh WHY do I torture myself by going to this Mcdonald's?......I would like to say I will never visit this location ever again, but how can I. I mean it's McDonald's whadda ya expect? But seriously? Words cannot describe how poorly each of my 3 visits went. 3 strikes aaaaand your OUT!Now I fully understand where comedians get their material from when they throw shade on Mikky D's inept employees, mediocre service, and crappie intercom.On a funnier side, the voice coming out of the intercom DOES really sound like Charlie Brown's teacher! Ya know the sound wah-wah wah wah wah-wah wah.LOL :D I could hardly believe it. At 1st I thought I was being punked. Ashton where are you when we need you?
