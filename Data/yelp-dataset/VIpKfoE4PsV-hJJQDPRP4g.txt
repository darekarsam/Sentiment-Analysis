5	Golden bear pool service has been servicing the pool ant a rental property i own for the past four years. He takes great pride in his work. He is very honest, reliable and always keeps me apprised of what is going on at the rental. I would recommend him with out any reservations. I am so happy to of finally found a honest and reliable pool service company.
5	We have had previous experience with weekly pool service that seemed like a waste of money as they only seemed to come and skim the pool and change the chlorine.....all in 10 minutes.  When we started to have trouble with algae we hired Golden Bear.  Brian the owner does all the work and really cares about what he does.  He looked at all of our equipment to make sure it was running properly and found a leak.  He came by twice in one week to check the levels and scrub the pool.  All while keeping his prices down.  So glad I came to yelp to find this company....he deserves the business.
5	Brian is Great!!!!! Our previous pool service had let our pool look more like a swamp, literally SO DIRTY. I called Golden Bear and he stopped by later that day and worked on our pool until 7pm and when he left the pool was so much cleaner. 24 hrs later crystal clear!! He also followed up the next day to make sure we were pleased. Can not say enough good things about the service we received.
