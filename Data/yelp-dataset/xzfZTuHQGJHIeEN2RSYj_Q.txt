4	This is a pretty sweet place to tailgate if you're headed to Panthers games! Its like an indoor/outdoor party zone with cool tailgating games (cornhole, etc). They also have a huge projection screen and other TVs with football on--kind of like an extreme version of a man-cave. You have to pay a donation to get in, but I found a deal on Living Social---and proceeds go to Make-a-wish--cant beat it for four free beers and food. It gets kind of hot inside the shed during the day, but they have a sound system connected to outside too, with tons to do outside as well. And you can bring your own cooler and grill and set up your tailgate outside the shed = a win. Def worth checking out!
1	I am new to the area and was asked to go to the first Panther games so I decided why not.  Let me start by saying this is a really weird place kinda man creepy.  They were asking for some people to pay and some people did not have to pay to enter? This was really confusing the parking attendants were nothing short of super rude.  No bathrooms  the beer is way over priced and I guess if your going to tailgate why not do it close to the action and not off the beaten path...
