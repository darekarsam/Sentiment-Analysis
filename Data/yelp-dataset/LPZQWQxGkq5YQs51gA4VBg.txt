5	Had my first pierogi here today. Very tasty!  Chicken florentine soup extremely good. Now going to dive into this Barbecue Chicken Pizza.
5	Visiting the city, we stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn in which the restaurant is located. They have a happy hour with drink and appetizer specials 5-7. We had steak quesadilla,  bourbon wings,  and fries. Delish!!!! Very impressed by quality and taste. Add the hot tea and a beer... cost during happy hr was $22.
1	Stayed in the hotel for dinner because I was tired and wanted to get work done. Should have gone out. Ordered hummus appetizer and a salad with grilled salmon. Anything but quick. Appetizer took a long time, then the salad took even longer. Hummus was grainy and not very tasty, though the presentation and the pita with roasted peppers was Ok. When the salad got there the salmon was over cooked, as in smelling burnt and dried out all through. Wasn't crowded so no excuse there. Wait staff was nice, so there's a star.With some nice places so close to the hotel, just walk down the street.
