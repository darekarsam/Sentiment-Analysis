1	We have done a lot of work with Unique over the years in our extended family. The company was awesome - exceptional work and service. However, the owners retired and the new owner has absolutely no customer service skills whatsoever. I have been trying to get him or anyone from his company to come to give us a quote for repair and work on cabinets that Unique installed 6 years ago. He is simply not interested at all and won't return phone calls. We cannot recommend this company anymore. Look elsewhere.
5	We just finished a kitchen cabinet remodel and couldn't be more happy. Working with David and his sub contractors couldn't have gone any smoother.  Whenever David said he would be at our home he was there right on time as were the other sub contractors. All calls were returned promptly. These are things you would expect but usually don't occur. ...as to the job David ideas and attention to detail  and execution were terrific. Additionally the remodel was fairly priced and completed on time. Our kitchen look fantastic and we would definitely recommend his company.Pete and Jane Gruber
5	I have been using Unique Cabinetry for years for our cabinetry and trim needs. I have always been really happy with them. They have always been professional to us and our clients. We do a lot of remodeling and always use Unique for all our projects, large or small. I always can count on getting a high quality product for a fair price. They have always met our timelines and are great to work with. I never have to worry with Unique if things will get done and to our satisfaction. It always turns out great!
