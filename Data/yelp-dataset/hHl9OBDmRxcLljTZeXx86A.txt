5	Eislea cut, highlighted and styled my hair today and I have not been happier with my hair in years. She listened to what I explained I wanted and gave me one of the best highlights and cut.
5	If you wanna get FTD (Fresh To Death), hit up my girl Eisela. She will hook it up!
5	Came to Chandler to Visit friends. I was recommended by friends to get my haircut by Eisela. After spending about an hour with her and getting my hair cut and adding color I couldn't be more happy. Everyone should take a moment and have her cut your hair. You will never go to anyone else again.
5	It has been one year since I found Eisela and she has been the ONLY one that has done my hair since then.  She really listens and has given me perfect cut, color, and style that is professional, easy to maintain, and I just plan LOVE.  If you haven't tried her yet, don't wait any longer!   Karla J
5	Eisela is an awesome hair stylist. She is very detail oriented with hair color application and she uses quality hair products. I watched her do a bridal up-do also, it was the prettiest wedding hair that I have ever seen! If I ever get married, I will have her do my hair.
5	I'm one of those difficult people when it comes to my hair. The one thing I always look for is for my stylist to be able to make decisions for me and not to be afraid to tell me what I need, what will work and what won't. Eisela is my lady.Quite sometime ago I needed a Dolce fix. I was so unhappy with my hair and I called Eisela and have been her client ever since. She fixed me right up!She knows her color. When I go in for my root touch ups it is always dead on.   She listens to what I am looking for and I trust her to do it right. I always come out feeling great. My sister also goes to her and she is now a believer. Trust me, you too can be  a believer if you see Eisela. If you need it done right Eisela is the woman.  Hair is serious and she does it right.
