5	This place is awesome! Yes we are a little young to play bingo all the time, and yes there are a lot of older senior citizens here. But this facility is great. Outside it looks like a run down steam boat, it's kind of cute. But inside it's really has a nice set up. More than enough room to be comfortable, a snack shop that has decent food. Volunteers roaming the room to make sure you are taken care of. Best thing about this, they do this for charity. In Cali we always went to churches for bingo, but this is a new breath of fresh air.
5	Love this place! Everyone is very nice from the staff to other players.  I've played during the weekday as well as Friday/Sat evenings. Bingo is so fun especially when you win!  They have games 7 days a week.  The facility is clean and organized. I recommend checking this place out.1st time players can print a $2 coupon from their website.
4	Played here last week- was fun! Staff is super friendly and the proceeds went to a homeless shelter and soup kitchens. My hubby had never played bingo before but he enjoyed himself and wants to go back before we end our vacation
5	Good time. My husband and I have gone there for a date night and had alot of fun.  The snack shop was yummy too!
