2	I had some time to kill before a dinner in the area, so I wandered in here for a little fun and experimentation with colors... It's a new shop, so I'm not really sure what the deal was, but I walked around for about 10 minutes and got nothing... After 5 more minutes, I saw a lot of nice brands and products, but I wasn't acknowledged by anyone, so I just left... If you know what you want and you're just looking to pick up an item, feel free to give it a whirl... If you're looking for attentive service, I don't know where you should go in the area, but I wouldn't expect it here... lol
3	It's a new Ulta; it looks pretty spiffy. The first week was awesome for trying out new brands and colors.  All the testers were fresh and new and not skeevy to dip into. The makeup section had a lot of space for makeup artists to pitch product; alas there were none available. Whereas Sephora seems to be staffed with people passionate about makeup, Ulta merely has retail workers. Ulta is picking up some new brands that Sephora doesn't have; Juice Beauty, Lipstick Queen and just recently Mally. Still fun to look around and swatch products on your arm, just don't look for any help in how to use them. If you like Ulta and and make up shopping you will probably enjoy it; but let's face it it's not what it used to be.
2	The staff here for the most part are nice.  But some are real pieces of work.  I love the nail polish and hair product selections here and I like the variety of lines they carry.  The store is always bright and clean.  The hair salon in the back is also nice.  But I'm not too sure as to why I made an appointment when I had to wait over 45 minutes to get my hair cut, and that's not including the time I waited before hand.  I really wanted to give this place more than 2 stars but their staff needs to work on talking to customers and less with each other. Why am I sitting and waiting for so long and no one even looks at me, when I established I was here for a hair cut appointment?  It didn't help the situation at all and needless to say, I don't want to get my hair cut there again.Katrina is a very nice and wonderful stylist, who once she was finished with her prior customer was able to give me a hair cut that I wanted and took great care of me.  If you are going here for a hair cut, ask for her.  Just be mindful that the staff do not know how to book appointments correctly and there will be a wait.
3	We've been spoiled by the service at our local Ulta. Had some time to kill today while other family members were shopping for furniture and decided to see if the new fall colors were out yet. We weren't acknowledged until my daughter had a question about a particular brand and the answer was sketchy at best. The staff needs more training about the lines they carry and about customer service. Many of the products are less expensive elsewhere, so they need to step up the service aspect.
4	Erika at the salon took me in for a last-minute "emergency" blowout that I absolutely had to have before work today. I am very nervous to trust stylists who are new to me, and she did a fantastic job! I'm really considering leaving my very expensive boutique salon and switching to Ulta.The store is clean and there is a lot more selection here than there is at most Ulta locations I have been to.I had to take off a star for all the other staff members who were out on the sales floor. This was my first time at this particular Ulta and not one person greeted me or asked if I needed anything, despite a couple of them making eye contact. After my blowout, I decided to restock on a few items. I'm perfectly capable of finding things myself, but it's pretty rude for absolutely no one to offer help when you're obviously looking around for something. One of the girls even scowled at me when I passed through an aisle to look at brushes; I guess I was in her way.If it had not been for Erika doing such a great job with my hair, I wouldn't have rated this location very highly at all.
3	This is a average Ulta location nothing out of the ordinary, but I like it!The sales associations always greet you and ensure you're finding everything. There's a nice selection of men's and women's perfumes and colognes. They carry most of the high-end mak-up lines along with OPI and Essie nail polish.Ulta is a beauty one stop shop...get your makeup, hair products, skin care, false eyelashes, and much more here!If you're a make-up beginner Ulta is a good place to stock up on make-up essentials. If you're thinking of a new hair style or color Ulta will have everything you'll need for the new look.Always check the website before purchasing, they usually have a coupon you can use in store.
3	The store is rather new, about a year old. I love the convenience of it...a lot easier to get to than the mall. I like how Ulta offers higher end make up brands and your drugstore brands. It is a one stop shop! Not only is it for women, but they sell men's products too. I always go to Ulta to get a facial by Barbara. They use Dermalogica products which is great because it doesn't break my face out and Barb is just amazing; I always leave there with my skin glowing. There have been a few times the store is out of my favorite products, but I know it's a distribution problem. If you are looking for great deals this is the place for you. Be sure to sign up for a rewards card and if you forget it they can look it up by your phone number!
3	Did I need $23 mascara? Probably not. Did I buy $23 mascara? You're damn right.This isn't my normal Ulta location, but I was on this side of town for a meeting and needed shampoo. I use Redken color safe and Ulta had it buy one, get one free. Plus, I had a coupon. Free money. The week before, I had been in a Sephora looking at two kinds of mascara. I didn't get it at the time because they were out of the one I wanted. Small problem: I could remember the two brands I looked at, but I couldn't remember which one I had decided to buy. I know it was the one that was much easier to remove. So, I talked to the very nice sales woman here about the two products. She didn't seem to know which one that was. However, she did let me try both on and even made sure I had the correct mascara wands for each one. The winner: Better Than Sex by Too Faced. Is it? Guess we'll see. Make sure to check your mailbox for Ulta sales ads. They usually have some pretty good deals for Christmas presents and stocking stuffers.
3	In here to pick up a replacement straightening doo-dad for Mrs K., we found a huge variety with prices ranging from $10 to beyond $250. We managed to avoid getting asked if we needed any help and managed to avoid buying anything else. How does that happen?Lots of stuff if you're looking for gifts, too!
