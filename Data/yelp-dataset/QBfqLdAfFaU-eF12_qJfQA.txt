4	Friendly and helpful. Been open for a while,  not sure why yelp refused to add this location the first time I put the info in.
5	Very friendly employees. If i look like im searching for something, they are quick to ask or help out. I got a price check on a cat converter and they printed out the various makers and their cost. Parking lot was also empty so i didnt have to drive far for parking. Clean and near store as well
5	second visit. first time I needed wiper blades and counter guy looked them up, picked them out and then went outside and installed them for me. awesome. try to tip him and he refused. unheard of in a town where everyone has their hand out.     last night went in with a list of stuff for a jetski. I don't feel like roaming the aisles with that deer in the headlight look so I went to the counter. super helpful, found everything on my list. guy knew right where to go for everything. saved me time and I got what I needed in one trip. great job. great employees, great experience. my new go to place for car and boat stuff.
4	This location on Rainbow south of the 215 freeway is a welcome sight for this area. I watched the building go up and I was excited when it was completed. The store is large and the isles are wide and neatly stocked. The employees are friendly and willing to help answer most of your car related questions. I just hope customers don't start to change their batteries and do other mechanical things to their cars right in the parking lot. This has made for some junky Autozone parking lots. Keep it clean- people.
