5	Sheila and Greta and the staff of Valley Press are excellent.  We've been working with them on various projects over the past year, and the work they do is high quality, done on time, for a fair price.  They've helped us with designing print materials, with printing brochures, postcards and booklets, always done on schedule, with a great and friendly attitude. We believe in supporting small, local businesses, and look forward to working with these great printers for a long time to come.
5	This shop is fantastic!  I designed some boxing shirts as a birthday gift for my husband and he loved them.  I just gave them some design ideas of how I wanted it to look and they shirts came out perfectly.  My husband absolutely loved them!
5	I had some business cards printed up for one of our businesses in the past, and they had them done in no time.  They are wonderful to work with.  Just this week, I needed some last minute business cards printed up for a new business venture, and they had them for me in an hour!  They are helping us design our logo, but we needed something on the fly and they took care of us!  Comparative pricing, great work, and easy to work with.  I recommend them for any of your printing needs!  We have a small business, and I like to support other small businesses.  This one is great.  I highly recommend Greta and her team.
