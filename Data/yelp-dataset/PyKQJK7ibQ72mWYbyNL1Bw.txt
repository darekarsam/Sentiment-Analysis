3	My first aparment when I moved to PhoenixPros:The management was always nice, even thought it changed 2 or 3 times while I lived there.  (Then again, always paying rent on time = nice management?)Utilities included was good, though I am sure it jacked up the rentWith no washer/dryer in unit (this will be an upcoming con...) there are washers/dryer facilities on site.The complex is tucked away behind an office complex and some trees, so it isn't directly on the street.Cons:The first night after I moved in my neighbor had her door kicked in by an angry ex.  I'm sure this is out of the complex's immediate control, but yikes.During my time here the covering of an entire row of parking became uprooted and collapsed, thankfully not on the side I was parked on.Overall it was an ok place to live, though when I was finished with school and got a job in North Phoenix I did not hesitate to get out.
1	Welcome to crackville! My car got broken into 5 times over the 2 years I lived there. The owners are total jerks ... you can kiss your security deposit goodbye! My AC went out both summers I was there.Stay away ... stay far, far away!

1	Unfortunately, I currently live here and would love to give the place great reviews but really it's just a mess.First, the rent is $922.30 for a spacious (900+ sq. ft.) 2-bedroom with utilities included. Sounds great, right? WRONG!$922.30 also includes roaches, maintenance that never fixes broken AC units, leaking ceilings, or cold shower faucets and instead says "we'll see what happens," a crazy black woman next door who is either a current or recovering meth/crack addict who likes to break into your apartment or start the building on fire, people who don't put their dogs on leashes or clean up their dog's poop, lots of noise from rowdy neighbors, phone calls to the police for domestic disturbance at 2am, a fake emergency maintenance number so you can never reach anyone, phone calls to the office that are not returned, stolen tires, and no one in the office when they say they will be there.The $922.30 excludes washers and dryers in unit, guaranteed parking, lighting fixtures outside, guaranteed delivery of packages, a clean pool, AC in the laundry room, and working laundry washers and dryers.Needless to say, I'm not renewing in November and will be lucky I only have to go month-to-month for December to hightail it out of here.
1	Pros: Great location, utilities included, spacious apartmentCons: Once you report an issue get a name because the next person has no clue on what is going on or there is a change in staff and you have to start all over with your complaint. They reassign parking spaces without notifying tenants. There is also no follow up.My main complaints:1. I have not had cold water for months. The water is extremely hot even though I am turning on the cold water. 2. I was reassigned to a parking spot that is further away from my apartment and I only have one assigned when I am suppose to have two.
