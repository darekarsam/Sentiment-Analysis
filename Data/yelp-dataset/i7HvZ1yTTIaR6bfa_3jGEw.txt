1	Today was the second day in a row that this store didnt have crispy fried chicken or crispy chicken strips.
1	So I used a credit card and didn't get a receipt... then my girlfriend asked the cashier if she can have buffalo sauce with the order and she said she didn't have any....but then soon enough another customer asked for hot sauce. My whole thing is the cashier could of suggested hot sauce instead of saying we don't have any. The hot sauce would of been the next best thing so customer service is out the window. Their dinning room is a mess all tables are dirty and all trash cans are filled to the brim. No napkins and a stupid alarm went off the whole time I was there because they had the back door open.
1	Poor customer service. I went through the drive thru & from the window u can see everything theyre doing...there were only 2 teenagers working at the time. I orders 2 famous bowls & a side of biscuits. The girl started making my bowls then set them both down & left them open to go flirt with a customer in the dining area at the register leaning all over the counter. The other worker finally came & finished my bowls. I only live a block away but sure enough all my food was cold when I got home.
1	Went there yesterday and horrible service.  I ordered the family meal and the girl that helped us had no Idea what she is doing. Can't take an order correctly,  then she says I have to pay with my card because she can't accept cash. When we were waiting for our food they were literally standing there talking instead of getting our order ready.  They also forgot the cake they give u with the family meal. Do not go there unless u want rude and horrible service!!!
