5	Always have nice friendly service when I'm in here. Not only do they do UPS but US Mail as well.
1	This UPS location prominently advertises its printing services. Upon printing a shipping label, I was inexplicably charged $2.50 because the file was on a thumb drive, requiring the employee to spend an extra 20 seconds to retrieve it. No mention was made of this absurd charge prior to printing. I'll give it a solitary star, because it is conveniently located.
