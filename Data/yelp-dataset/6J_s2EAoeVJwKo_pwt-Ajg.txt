3	Sends me junk mail trying to get me to get insurance at least once a month. I've tried emailing to unsubscribe with no luck or response. Guess I will have to try calling, but not sure I want to risk her having my number only to receive calls from other agents... Leaving at three stars because I have not had business with her as an insurance agent.
5	Donna has been my agent for about 11 years now. She takes care of my insurance for my cars, home, life and business as well as some retirement accounts. She has taken great care of it all, including some last minute stuff that had to be dealt with quickly due to my poor planning. Donna has also handled some claims for us, with great results. Her team is very knowledgeable and professional.
