1	Passage to India is just another curry house serving up dishes with muddled flavors that won't excite you.  Paratha was a bit dense and came to the table when I was half way through my curry.
4	I did a curry tour of Edinburgh while I was there on holiday. See, I eat curry and spicy food like NOBODY's business - I eat food so hot that I've literally watched others cry over a mere taste at my food. So, I decided to hit a different Indian joint each night while I was in the city in search of the most flavorful and spiciest curry.This place was pretty good. The staff were more interested in chatting with each other than serving, which I'm not opposed to as a rule but it wasn't the most welcoming atmosphere. Also, the prices were a bit higher than I expected, which sort of put me off. And, since I'm complaining, my request for the dish to be "extra extra spicy" was obviously not taken seriously because I could've poured my meal into my eyes and it wouldn't have hurt. That aside, the atmosphere was very elegant and simultaneously welcoming, which was nice. And the food WAS very delicious. I'm not sure I've ever had a tastier dal (lentil) dish than the one I had here. That I had to bring my own Thai Chile Peppers to add even a zest of spice was unfortunate but the chef's ability to bring out subtle flavor was extremely impressive - redeeming in and of itself. So, not Edinburgh's spiciest curry and never going to come close, but it sure tasted good!
