1	Horrible. I only go in for tacos. But no more. They just have no flavor. And .99 cent Monday, tues. and wed. Are gone, witch makes them even less worth spending money on them. The last time I went was the last time for me. I ordered 3 tacos and asked for and paid for extra cheese. When I got home and opened them up, I realized I was ripped off. At best  a pinch of cheese. Just not worth the money or hassle.
1	First visit was great.  Last visit was terrible.  Slow service even though it was literally empty.  Order was incorrect.  Then left with food to eat at home and it was awful.  Fish in fish tacos was so over done it couldn't even be bitten off or chewed.  Never going back!
5	Amazing food. And fresh. This is 3rd time I've been here for my Lunch. Their carne asada fries are amazing and i get their carne asada burrito. Quality is great. Prices are higher but so worth it.. And they do have a senior menu
5	Excellent breakfast.   This was our first visit.  We had the chorizo plate with rice and beans.  Restaurant was very clean and updated.  Food portions were large and high quality.  We will be back soon.
