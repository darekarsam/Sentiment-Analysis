4	I would definitely come here again any day of the week.  The staff are some of the friendliest I've come across and make every effort to make you feel welcome.  Although the food actually took a while to arrive we weren't bothered just because the guy behind the counter had a smile on his face the whole time.  The menu is well priced and has a good range of authentic chinese dishes.  Their egg fried rice is excellent and tastes really aromatic and moist.  I had it with sweet and sour duck which was also amazing and had a great range of flavours.  I certainly recommend Good Year, it's so friendly it's almost fun.
3	I've been using this place for the last 4 years and have found it consistently good for takeaway.Probably not the best Chinese I've had but none the less very good.  Delivery is very quick - usually within 20 mins.
