5	Absolutely, a four and a half star restaurant.  Grandma B's is the best diner in Pittsburgh. I ordered French toast with beef sausage which was good. Though the highlight of the meal was certainly the Philly cheesesteak my friend ordered. It was the best cheesesteak that I've ever tried. I highly recommend ordering the cheesesteak for your first meal here. I take full responsibility if you don't find the cheesesteak to be outstanding.
5	Best breakfast in Pittsburgh! French toast and grits were delicious. Great, friendly, and quick service.
5	Bar none the best breakfast in Pittsburgh. I know of no other place where you can get the quantity and quality of food available from Grandma B's.  Get the monster fish sandwich!
5	I'm from California and was in Pittsburgh for less than 24 hours to meet some people.  If I can't go to Philly might as well settle for something in Pittsburgh!  Please see my attached photos.  I bought 2 Philly Cheese steaks and they were AMAZING!    I don't know what kind of fries he uses but they were fantastic.  I ate half of one and took the remainder back on the plane with me....IN MY CARRY ON!!!  The staff was friendly as well.Bad neighborhood?  I don't think so, come to they Bay Area and I can show you bad neighborhoods.  It was safe enough for me, a Central Asian, to go in, have my order freshly prepared and leave my uninsured rental car outside.FYI:  The place is closed Friday 1-2:30pm (or was it 2:15, I can't remember).
