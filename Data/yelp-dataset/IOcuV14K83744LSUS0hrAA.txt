5	I have been going here for over two years.  I moved 30 minutes north, and I still make the trip to go to him because he is the best!  He is certified in pediatric and pregnancy.  I started coming here when I was pregnant with my second daughter.  I know he is also a certified sports chiropractor.Kathy, in the front office, is one of my most favorite people ever!  She always has a friendly smile and is so helpful!  I also love Heidi, the massage therapist, who is there on Fridays!I have recommended him to friends.  He is the best!Update:  I left here when the main doctor left years ago.  Dr. Patrick Chivaroli was amazing!  I don't know where he went, but I definitely recommend him!  When he left, there was a girl chiropractor, and she was fine, but I didn't like her enough to keep making the 30 minute drive.  I now have a new chiro right near me in Tramonto who I love!
5	I went to Dr Kendra with a stiff neck and lower back pain. I was totally surprised when I left after the first visit and could look "over my shoulder" to back out of my parking spot! I haven't been able to do this in months! She is a very caring doctor who called me after the visit to check on how I felt. I can't wait to get back and continue treatment.
