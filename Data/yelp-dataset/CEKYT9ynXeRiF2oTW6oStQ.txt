5	I work for a wholesale fashion company, and one of my co-workers mentioned how cute this place would be for a photo shoot. I contacted Kate about having a photoshoot there and she was more than helpful getting the location set up.This place is seriously too cute for words. You can tell that the owners put their heart into every single detail. They have bikes to bike around old town, an on site restaurant,  and an amazing infinity pool right outside the signature flat. Everything from the inside to the fireplace and garden area was just amazing. My team and I kept saying how we needed to stay there ourselves! All in all the pictures came out great and I was so happy to have our shoot at this location. Awesome awesome job!
