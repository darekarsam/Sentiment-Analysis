1	Just had the most degrading experience at the business center in Las Vegas (Store# 0006509 Lake Mead & Buffalo- Vons In-Store). Brittany & Angie are rude, presumptive, and have no business representing this prestigious brand. I'm quite disappointed in Wells Fargo. Never again will I be subjected to such disregarding & arrogant treatment! Never again!!!!
4	I have done banking with dozens of institutions over the past 40+ years, and with the exception of M&T Bank in Buffalo, no bank has ever treated me better, provided the right mix of services and done more to help my business than Wells Fargo. Moving to Las Vegas from Gilbert, AZ I was concerned that this local branch would not be able to match the service I received from the Gilbert Wells Fargo branch... I have been pleasantly surprised at the high level of personal service and the ease they make doing business at this Las Vegas Wells Fargo branch.  I highly recommend Wells Fargo, especially for small businesses and sole proprietors. I wanted to give this business five stars, but the reality is they are, after all, bankers!
5	The customer service at this branch is incredible!I have been going here for years....Ricardo, the business banker is top notch, no matter what I need. He is so respectful, attentive.I specifically go to this branch for everything.
5	Everybody here is so friendly. First time using the drive thru. There are 3 lanes going right now. Very comvenient. Dont forget they have a notary for their customers.
1	If i can give 1 star ill doit worst costumer service i spoke to some asiya banker she has a "f" attitude and poor communication  on english... sorry if u have to work on Christmas eve or get a new job please
