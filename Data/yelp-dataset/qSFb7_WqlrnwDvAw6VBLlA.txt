5	The biggest and best selection of Fireworks on the East Coast
5	While it was super crowded on the 4th of July, these guys had a very good selection of high quality fireworks. Parking was a bit scarce, but that was likely because of the day we went. Go here to quench your inner pyro.
4	Huge selection of fireworks in a very clean and well lit store! It's kind of weird because it's attached to a gas station & there is a Quinzo's. They have a lot of Black Cat brand fireworks. They also offer many BOGO deals. They had stations that you could preview what the firework looked like at various kiosks. I'm no fireworks pro but I liked it better than Davey Jones. I found the same item here 1/2 the price!
