5	Very clean store.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Prices are very good.  Huge selection of health food and everyday items you need when you're on the road.
4	This Food Lion store was formerly named Bloom.  This was my favorite Bloom location in the area.  The isles were always clear and the store and especially the bathrooms were always clean!  The Food Lion brand is now on the store (same company) and so far, the store appears to be kept up to the Bloom standards.  I will say that I did not see many of the  yellow Food Lion MVP sale signs throughout the isles.  I hope they plan to incorporate the sale items as quickly as possible.  This is a nice place to shop on my way home from work esp. when I am waiting for the little one at Miss Donna's dance studio that is in the same shopping center.
5	Nicest Food Lion Ive ever been to and open till 11pm.A Food Lion with a solid craft beer selection and a nicely separated area for wines?  Yes, please.  This whole place screams Harris Teeter, its just a better than the rest Food Lion.  With not too many other options in this developing area, it was a good choice to put here.
