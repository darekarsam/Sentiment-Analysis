5	Gerry was our pet trainer for classes we took at Petsmart. He was AMAZING!! He helped me with issues our puppy was having and even gave us his phone number in case we had problems outside of class. What a great example of personalized customer service!!
4	I love PetSmart we've always bought our Bull Terriers food here. We like that they have a variety of food I especially like the all natural selections that they offer. The staff is always very friendly. They always help me out with questions about the different types of food and training for our hyper bull terrier.
5	They always are so nice and upbeat when we take our fur babies in for a"spa say"...I feel very comfortable leaving my dogs there.
