4	It's clean, there are always machines available, different size loads, dryer is 7.5 mins. per quarter and you can choose the heat setting, detergent, softener and dryer sheets are sold for .75 cents, on site attendant, tv.  Also there is a 7eleven next door.
1	I was so disappointed with this establishment. Song and dance on the phone then bait and switch when you got there. He wanted to be paid up front but didn't have a scale to weigh my clothes. Most of his machines were broken. Very seedy and undesirable place. Went to West Flamingo Fold and Fluff instead. THEY were gems!!
4	Small washers 7 quartersBig washers 11 quartersDryers cost a quarter for i believe every 7 min. or soThey have a change machine that can break $1,5,10 and $20. Also, if you forgot or dont have laundry soap they sale them for 75 cents as well as bounce, downy and clorox.It feels pretty cool in here better than the heat outside. Theres a tv and offer alot of washing and dryer machines.Cons: its kind of expensive to wash your clothes here. Idk if thats a good price in Vegas but we're traveling from Oregon and it just seems expensive.P.S 7-11 is right next door. Go get a slurpee whole waiting for your clothes.
