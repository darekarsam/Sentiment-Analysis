4	Always have a hard time giving a fast food restaurant 5 stars, so 4 is tops when it comes to fast food.  Been here a number of times for breakfast on my way to work, and the food has always been hot and fresh.Today was a sausage biscuit, hashbrown and a small coke.  The biscuit had a nice crisp out shell with a soft fluffy inside, the sausage was hot, and the hasbround was hot and crispy.This is really my go to breakfast place when I am running late and need something hot, fresh, and quick.
3	It's Mcdonald's so there's not much to say about the food as you know what you're getting but the drive thru stinks. I've had to pull around and wait 3 out of 4 visits now.
1	3 more visits, 1 pull around for two happy meals and 1 visit two days ago with a happy meal with nothing but a toy and apple slices after we got home. We microwaved some Costco chicken nuggets do our two year old had nuggets with his happy meal. This location is horrible!
