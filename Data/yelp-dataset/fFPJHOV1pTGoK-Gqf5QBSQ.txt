5	Walked into what I thought was the ghetto and ended up being some of the best cajun chicken I have had in Phoenix.  Looking forward to another Krispy Krunchy Chicken experience! Thanks WY
4	Great fried chicken and Pizza/Hot Wings. This place is a restaurant and grocery/convenient store with money services and check cash.
5	This has to be one of the best surprises ever walking into this place! From the looks of it, it doesn't look like a place I would normally stop to eat at. Thank goodness for friends! My friend brought me here last week and I'm back again on my own today. The cat fish was great! This time around I'm getting the chicken and, of course, I'm sneaking room in for another cat fish! But the best thing going are these biscuits! Oh, my food just arrived! Gotta go, but come check this place out! It's great!
5	Catfish BOMB!!.... Chicken BOMB!!!.... Pizza BOMB!!!!  The most underestimated place in Phx. Love it!!!
