1	Beware of what you purchase from this store, I have a $4000 Babe Ruth autographed piece that was purchased here that is a FAKE after multiple e-mails over the past few YEARS I cannot get them to refund my money.This Business was bought out over two years ago by a company called FANATICS...I can tell you that they are a Top Notch Organization that puts the customer first! I sent my complaint to the Regional Vice President and within a few days he resolved the whole thing. He took the piece back and gave me a Store Credit for my Item along with an additional $1000 Store Credit for my troubles. I wouldn't have any problem buying from them in the future, they stand by what they sell and if your not happy they will take care of you and make things right!!! Thank you Mike and Dan for helping me get this resolved.
1	0 rating. If you like paying 4-5 times what you should then go here and get "taken" by this place. They will charge you 10 times what an autographed helmet would cost on line...with authentication. DONT BUY ANYTHING HERE. Be warned!!!!
