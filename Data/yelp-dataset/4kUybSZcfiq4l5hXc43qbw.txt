5	Fast, efficient, knowledgeable and a terrific experience from beginning to end! Thank you all so much.
1	If you love to waste your time and money, then this is the company for you. I should have trusted my gut when Brad actually answered the phone in the middle of  our first meeting. We tried to refinance a house through Noble Home Loans and it was by far the worst experience (the process took 8 MONTHS) and we wasted over $1,000.00. He claims that it is illegal for his company to pay for the appraisal up front and makes the customer pay for it. Which I found out later is a complete lie. We ended up having to pay for two appraisals because his staff is incompetent and could not refinance our house in the appropriate time. After 8 months, we were told the documents were finally completed and we could go sign. We were told that we would not have to come up with any money at closing. I was unsure about that and asked them repeatedly if it was going to cost us anything. Brad and his staff said NO. When we got to the signing the gentleman asked where the money was- we owed over $1500 in closing costs. WHAT!! We ended up walking away and I found an amazing loan officer that same day. Our house was financed from start to finish in less than 30 days. The closing costs were very clear from the beginning AND he paid for the appraisal up front. His motto is that the customer never has to pay for something up front. WoW!To make matters worse, the gentleman that referred us to Brad end up getting in a fight with Brad as well and switched to my current loan officer. Honestly, I am baffled that this company is still in business.
