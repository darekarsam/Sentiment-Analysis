5	3 snaps in a Z-Formation!! Hope you got my early-90's In Living Color reference there... Well, if you're too young/old or just plain lame and didn't watch the show back in the day, it translates to them being awesome!!! Above AND beyond customer service, as well as very fair pricing and great communication efforts. Wes was fabulous to work with!
5	Excellent  job, Wes!!!- fair price and the work was done within the promised time frame.The VW Passat runs great Thanks again Wes!!!
5	They just do good work at a reasonable price.  Scheduled services are no issue but when something has broken they have been able to get me in, figure out what was wrong, and get it fixed quickly and efficiently.  Finding a reputable shop always is a matter of some angst and I am very glad to have found this one.
5	Tire going flat.  Kirk got me in and out in less than an hour!  Fixed slow leak.  Checked spare out.  You guys are awesome! Thanks.
5	While visiting Arizona, our truck's parking brake cable broke. We were stranded at our RV site. After calling multiple local mechanics, Kirk was the only one willing to drive 15 minutes to us to offer his help and expertise. Both him and Wes were very pleasant to talk to on the phone and they displayed excellent customer service and professionalism. They will definitely be our go to mechanics anytime we are out this way again. Truly appreciative.
5	Locally owned full service.  Very efficient, friendly, knowledgeable. I've used them for the last four years and they remain at the top of their game.  Very dependable.
