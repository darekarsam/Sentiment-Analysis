5	Robin Camacho, the broker, is very knowledgable. I am grateful I received the opportunity to work with her.
5	As a Realtor in Las Vegas, I love working with Sellstate Neighborhood! They are always very friendly, knowledgeable, and professional.
5	My family and I were looking for a home in the area and by chance came across Anthony Burton with SellState (702-785-1036).  He was such a professional!  He listened to our needs and got us a number of showings which suit us.  He was very easy to work with, very clear about the process and was truly working for our best interests.  I was wary about this process, but he put my mind at ease and went above and beyond our expectations to get us better than what we wanted via his negotiations!  If you are not using Anthony and SellState, stop, give him a call and get ready to rest easy in the process.  Oh and as a bonus, he is a veteran and knows his stuff.
