3	Good prices, great value,  nice selection s.
5	Good prices and delicious ice cream. Friendly staffThe circus cookie ice cream is awesome. So is the bubble gum.
5	Great ice cream. I had the pistachio in a Waffle cone. Prices are very reasonable and quality is outstanding.  I want to come back again and again to try some other flavors like chocolate brownie.
3	The ice cream is great and the service was good but the same Pedaler camps out front begging for money. I don't carry cash but I'm getting tired of being hit up for "spare change".  For the sake of their business they need to ask him to leave.
3	Good ice cream, mediocre service and a bit overpriced in my opinion.
