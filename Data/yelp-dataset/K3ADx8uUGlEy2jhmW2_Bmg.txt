5	Palm Beach Tan used to be Darque Tan. Nothing has changed besides the name. And this is a good thing. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the beds, lotions, and monthly packages. Best tanning salon in Scottsdale. I would recommend anyone looking for a spa like atmosphere and high quality beds and spray tans to use Palm Beach Tan. They have all sorts of lotions to buy and usually a deal to accompany. The only thing that sucks is that I got burnt the first time I tanned. My fault because I negotiated with the rep to do 5 min instead of 4min. I am as a red as a lobster. Next time I will be more careful but cannot wait to get back! Like I said best tanning salon in Scottsdale and I have tried a few.
5	I have an unlimited membership to this salon for only $89 dollars a month. I can use any bed, spray machine, or any other facilities they have everyday. Meaning I can go spray tanning every day if I wish, and usually a spray tan is around $20. I really take advantage of my membership. Not only is it a great value, but the store is extremely clean and the customer services is amazing, they aren't pushy into having you buy products if you don't wish to buy them like many of the other salons I have gone to, they basically won't let you leave until you buy a product.
