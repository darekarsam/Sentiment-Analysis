2	Selection was good but customer service was horrible. I stood at the checkout with clothes in hand for ten minutes before anyone came over to check me out. When someone finally did come over, I was very quickly passed off to another associate. This second associate answered three phone calls before beginning to ring me out. Each phone call required her to leave the register area and check something on the sales floor. Meanwhile, I'm still standing at checkout just waiting to pay. It took twenty minutes to pay for my five items and leave. For better customer service, I recommend going to the Santan Village location.
5	As a recent college graduate, I went to get a suit for my current and future job interviews. I already had a list of my preference in hand as I walked into the store. I was immediately greeted by a sales associate who looked over my list and found exactly what I wanted. The suit he grabbed also qualified for their buy one, get one free program so I ended up getting two suits. My interview was the next day, so they were able to get it tailored in time for the interview and I pick up my second suit today (one week later). I was in and out in 30 minutes. Yes, they will try to sell you dress shirts, ties, socks, shoes, tie bars, etc, but if you know what you want, then its not a big deal. I highly recommend this location (by superstition mall) and will be returning here in the future to get alterations done on some of my other clothes.
