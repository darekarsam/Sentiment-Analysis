1	I used to LOVE this place, the woman that worked there Nhidie, was amazing and has great customer service.  Since Belly Elan moved to Blakeny, the customer service has been horrific.  There is another woman who works there and EVERYTIME I go in there she is on her phone on a personal call.  I have been in maybe 9 or 10 times, everytime she barely acknowledges the customers and continues to talk on her phone.  Today, I thought, "well...let's give them one final try!"  Unfortunately it was the same story! :)When I am in there I am looking for help in sizing, styles, etc.... but I get so irritated I usually walk out and will go to another maternity store.  I would love to see a small business in Charlotte survive, but to be honest with this type of service, I am not sure how they will!
4	Need to find a cute gift for a baby? How about an expecting mama? If you answered yes to either of these questions and you're driving around Blakeney, Belly Elan is a solid choice.Even though this maternity boutique is small and quaint, there are plenty of sweet options for mamas/mamas to be. Whether it's a cute dress, a fun necklace or an awesomely titled onesie like "This Is How I Roll," Belly Elan gives you options. Expect pricey-ish onesies, outfits, burp cloths, etc. But boy are they cute. I had a really good experience with the two ladies who worked there. They helped me choose the (hopefully) correct size and gift wrapped my item, gratis. If you're with child or buying for someone who is, this is a niche boutique that's *expecting* you.
1	I ordered an item from these folks on the internet...they took my money via PayPal; however, they did not have the item in stock that I ordered.  I sent them an email asking them to let me know the status of the order, but they have not returned that email.  Additionally, the phone number that was on my order receipt is disconnected.  Great service...I'll be contacting PayPal for a refund from these people.
