5	We used the Driver Provider to help transport over 100 of our wedding guests to our rehearsal dinner and it was an absolutely terrific experience. Not only were their rates very affordable but the the customer service was superb and the driver was very personable and accommodating (please forgive me as I forgot his name) We will definitely be sure to use the Driver Provider in the future for any transportation needs we have and I recommend you do so as well.
5	I used Driver Provider to transport out of town guests for our daughter wedding from the hotel to our home for a pre wedding reception.  The mini bus arrived 15 mins early and comfortably transported 39 guest in style and comfort.  The driver "Ace" was very polite, pleasant and professional. The company contacted me right away with the quote and the transaction was quick and easy.  I will use no other service from now on!
