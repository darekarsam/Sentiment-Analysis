4	This beautifull, old fashioned Hotel with great rooms is situated in a quiet road. But very near to the center, by feet only some minutes. The reception was very friendly. The room is clean, the bathroom gigantic with tub and shower. The bed feels fine.After two nights: the room is good, the bed a little to hard. The breakfast not good: old joghurt, burnt toast, grapes "with fur" on them. Perhaps because there is some refurbisching done. All together: okay, but perfectly situated
5	This place is a must-stay. Perfect location (away from the tourist traps of Edinburgh but still within 15mins walk of the Royal Mile), close to one of the UK's best coffee places (Artisan Roast in Broughton St) with some simply fantastic nearby restaurants, the Albany has some of the best, most attentive and welcoming staff around. Enormous, comfortable and well-appointed rooms in this big ole rambling set of row houses will have you excited to come home after a day of exploring this great town. We'll be heading back here every chance we get...
