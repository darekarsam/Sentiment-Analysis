4	This is the newest, cleanest, and least crowded of all the fast food/pit stop places in Gila Bend. It's the first thing you pass if you come from the Yuma direction and the last thing you pass if you come from Phoenix. The McDonald's has always been the old standby but now there's a less crowded alternative. It is actually at the western end of the big parking lot that has McDonald's and a whole lot of huge truck parking spaces. Service was decent and food was alright. Bathroom was clean. I usually just blow through Gila Bend but if I need to stop here, this is the place.
3	Sweet potato fries and orange cream shakes, those are my wife and son's kryptonite :-)
2	My wife and I were on our way back to San Diego after spending a few days in Tucson.Sometimes you just have to eat....somewhere.I had never eaten Carl's Jr food before but my wife told me they were better than McDonalds and there wasn't much choice in this desolate neck of the woods.Apart from my thick shake I thought my double beef burger and zucchini fries tasted like crap.Their burgers sure look a lot bigger and fatter on TV.Hopefully we won't be back.
