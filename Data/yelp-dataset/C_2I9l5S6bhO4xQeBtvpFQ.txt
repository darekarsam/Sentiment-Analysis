1	Mom signed up for & prepaid for everything when she lived in Vegas. We have since moved her to Calif. assuming we could transfer the Neptune service. According to this office & Corp. we can't transfer it but could add the travel plan for $474 & then when the time came we'd have to call Vegas (M-F) to make arrangements for in Calif.  I called a local CA Neptune office & was told Vegas was an affiliate & we could transfer the contract. I contacted the location closest to contact Vegas to send the contract.  They told me to do it so I did & Vegas said no one had contacted them but ok they'd do it. Then I get a call from some Regional Manager in Nevada who said no they can't send out the contract.  I asked for copies to be sent & he said they could be found online but without the additional $475 travel plan the Calif agency may charge more.This is still unsettled and I am sick to death of it.  Word of caution: don't prepay (especially Neptune in Las Vegas) unless you're sure you'll die in the town where you signed the contract!!!  This Las Vegas office is terrible.
1	I attempted to communicate with this company for my boss, who just had a relative pass. I called several times and emailed the contact that he gave me.  She never responded to anything. The women who answers the main phone line is extremely nice, however something is seriously lacking with this company. They put me is an awkward situation and I would not recommend them to anyone.
