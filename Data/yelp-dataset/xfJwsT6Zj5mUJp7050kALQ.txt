5	The cleaners arrived early and did a wonderful job.  My carpet looks like new and that's hard to image with 5 pets and 2 kids!  They finished in under 2 hours and left shoe covers for us to wear until the carpet dried.  They were also very affordable.  I would recommend them to anyone!
5	I called Mustang the day before I needed them to clean my 7 ft couch with numerous pillows and my 4 ft oversized chair with ottoman. They arrived on time and spent quite a bit of time working on getting the pet hair and stains out. In the end I'm really happy with the results and shall be calling them when I need my carpets and tile done too.
5	Mustang got the call in the morning and was able to come to my home by afternoon to steam & deodorize 3 rooms of carpet.  They were careful, tidy and thorough, all much appreciated!  They also did a fantastic job of cleaning up light colored grout and tile of a very very dirty rental.Thanks guys :D
5	I called Mustang Carpet and Tile yesterday (Tuesday), and told them i needed my 'new' couches cleaned ASAP. I run a business, so I know how scheduling works, but it just so happened they had an opening the NEXT morning! They gave me a half-hour arrival period (tight!), and showed up right on time, early this morning. One of the great things about this company, is they will give you a price right over the phone, instead of telling you they have to be at the location to determine.I got both of my over-sized sofas with a thousand pillows apiece cleaned for under $150, and it didn't take them long at all! I hung out with Justin V. and Derek B. while they were steam cleaning the couches, and they were super personable and knowledgeable about all the questions I had, and they were also extremely thorough with their work. I love my new clean couches, and I will refer Mustang Carpet and Tile to ALL of my friends and family when they need carpet, tile or upholstery cleaned, and definitely ask for Justin and Derek!!!
