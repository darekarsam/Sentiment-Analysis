4	Was on a road trip with the hubby so stopped through here to grab a quick Egg White Delight McMuffin.   Hubby ordered the same thing but on the McGriddle bun - interesting, I know.  The order taker was really bubbly, especially for the wee hours of the morning - I can appreciate that!   Everything came out as we expected.  There were no issues with the order and napkins and all requested condiments were in the bag.  I consider this a major accomplishment as most times, the folks in the drive-thru always leave something out...be it napkins, a straw, whatever!  4 stars for great customer service and order accuracy on the FIRST try - even with my husband's "special" order :-)
1	I can't even believe I am writing a review on MCDONALDS! ..But this place was TERRIBLE !! I pulled in at exactly 9:01PM (I know bc I just text someone asking if they wanted anything) and waiting until 9:10PM WITHOUT BEING HELP ON ! I actually drove to the first window, NO ONE THERE, drove to the second window, NO ONE THERE !! It was like everyone went to break! I was so annoyed and frustrated I drove off bc if I would of said something my food prob would of gotten spit in so I went to BURGER KING !! Called McDonalds right after leaving, finally someone picks up, asked to speak with a manager and he tells me "Oh I don't know what happen, I don't know where she could be" LMAO WTF either do I ! SMH just WHOA ! What BAD SERVICE !!
1	Without a doubt this is the worst and horribly managed McDonald's in the entire universe.11 minutes to get an unsweetened tea with light ice if you can't get that order right you really shouldn't be working anywhere other than the hospital that did your lobotomy. I am convinced they are only in business because they have a golden arches and people who know no better go there. I will not be making that mistake again!
