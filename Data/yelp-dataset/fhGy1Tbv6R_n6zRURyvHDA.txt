5	A definite find for this area.   This restaurant which does not have an interior entrance at the shopping center,  but only exterior.  has fine food.    I enjoyed the bavette, which had a very nice sauce.  The others had chicken dishes which they enjoyed.  Service was excellent except that they asked if we would like some bread and never brought it.   Maybe that was  just a survey on people liking bread
