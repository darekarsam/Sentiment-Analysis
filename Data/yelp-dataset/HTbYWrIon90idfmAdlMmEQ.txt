5	Best place to have your taxi cab driver or DD drive through to pick up monster tacos and an oreo shake that you will greatly enjoy while still inebriated, but completely regret the next morning! Yeah, buddy!

Depending on the time of day, this Jack-In-the-Box will be hosting a steady stream of Cocopah Middle Schoolers, or a crowd of Chaparral High School students or a parade of young adults sobering up from a night of partying. And let's not forget Jack's core target demographic, the late night stoner suffering from the munchies. That's what a diverse snack-oriented menu, a dining room open until midnight and a drive-thru open 24 hours a day, will do for you. And it doesn't hurt that most of the workers here are very friendly.
