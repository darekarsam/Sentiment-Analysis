4	Love this place don't even have to get out of your car.
4	Who doesn't love a drive thru?Well, I may be the oddball out here.  I actually walked into this place instead of opting for the drive thru.  Hey hey now, I hear the criticism coming from the back, but I was already out of my car at another store nearby and it felt unneeded to get back in my car to drive less than 25 feet.It is sometimes better to do this, especially if it is the first time at the establishment, which was my case.  I wasn't sure what types of brew they had within, so I would have been that annoying person at the drive thru who could not decide what to get.  They have all the basic domestics in stock, and some are in the cooler as well if you are too impatient to chill them at home.  They also have a section that has a pretty nice spread of imports.  Be sure to also look around a bit, if you can't find your beer of choice, just keep looking, that's what happened to me.  Also, the staff are always able to assist you in anything you need.  Prices aren't bad either, about as typical as any other distributor in the area.They also do lottery here as well.
4	well. i just had a quick experience (you know, because its drive thru) but it worked out well! It's located in the Braddock Hills Shopping Plaza (same plaza as the Propel school for Braddock Hills on the opposite end) It's located on the end and you just literally drive up to the door on the side. The sweet guy came out, asked what we wanted very friendly, then went in to go grab it. we popped the trunk the he came back and stuck in it (i know this sounds like a 1st grade book, but i didnt want a super short review lol) anyways it worked out fine and we were on our way in two minutes!
5	I love this place!  They have great service and an awesome selection and their prices are good too!
