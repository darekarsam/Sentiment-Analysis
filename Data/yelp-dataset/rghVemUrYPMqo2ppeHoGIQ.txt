4	We decided to do this class for a day option to start my best friend's bachelorette party 'day of fun'. We had heard good things about these classes and this one offers you a free shot so we picked it!It was a great choice. We had a blast! We laughed hysterically at each other but were also impressed by how sexy our instructor was able to make us feel. Some of the moves we learned were beyond sexy and she helped those of us that aren't as comfortable with that... do it anyway ;)The only reason I gave it four stars was because we wished it was a little bit longer. I was just starting to get the hang of it and the class was over. An hour sounded long but it flew by and I felt like if I had a bit more time it would have been beneficial.I recommend this place though. From booking to the end, it was a pleasant experience and I will do it again for the next Vegas trip.
