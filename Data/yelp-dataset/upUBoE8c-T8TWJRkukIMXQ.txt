5	Having a home inspection with Wright Inspections was a great experience.  I've been through several home inspections in my life and felt with Daren I really received an inspection!  He saved me from purchasing the first home I had him out to by finding mold and moisture in the walls; thanks Daren!  When I found my next (and current) home, of course I called Daren.  The water tank burst during the inspection and Daren helped get the area cleaned up and secure.  His inspection found issues I could deal with and Daren's report has been my guide for prioritizing my home maintenance.  Highly recommend Wright Inspections!!
5	It was my first experience with a home inspection as a first home buyer so I did not know what to expect.  After getting a verbal summary of the inspection from Daren Wright immediately after his inspection and obtaining the report the very next day, I asked for my realtor's opinion.  My realtor said the report was "Great" and very detailed.  It was such a relief to know that I had selected the "Wright" inspector for the job.  The rates were lower than the other companies I researched.  Highly recommended.
5	This was my first time ordering a home inspection. Darren, did an excellent job he went above and beyond what I expected. I sure got my moneys worth for the inspection. He explained every step of his inspection to me. Darren, knew all the building codes by heart and could explain everything you wanted to know. If I ever needed another inspection or was going to recommend an inspector I would not hesitate to recommend wright inspections llc.
