3	I don't know who reviews high schools, but since I'm the first to post an actual review for an educational venue, apparently I am the chosen one to do so.As far as high schools go, I don't have much experience. Due to moving out of city one year, in the midst of my high school career, I have attended three high schools. (Wait...I guess I am pretty experienced.)  Hamilton High is just your average high school - except larger. When I was attending, there had been approximately 4,000 (or close to that number, anyway) in my class. When you're in such a large school, there is a tendency for a high schooler to feel ignored and  go through the whole emotional turmoil bullshit that every high schooler goes through...well, some people even experience that in their early twenties to late adulthood.So, to be totally honest with you, every high school is the same- the experiences, the people, the clubs, the "cramming sessions" for tests, proms, dances, cliques, yeah...it's all real. In some schools, it is more prevalent..and others not so much. Just stay in school and you'll be alright.
4	This review is for their football stadium.  Our Son's team came here to play Hamilton.  As one of the powerhouse schools in the Valley, they kicked our you-know-what pretty good.  Despite the loss, I have to give them props for how well kept the football stadium/field is.There's plenty of parking, it's well lit, and the visiting bleacher section is nicer than most other schools.  It was also easy to park and walk to the stadium.  Some other schools in town, the parking is far away...not here.Return Factor - 100% (see you next season!)
