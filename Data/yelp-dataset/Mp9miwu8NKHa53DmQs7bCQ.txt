5	Best Event planning service in all phoenix!!! Hands down!! We recently had a Marriage Conference at our Church and we had to get some walls for the tent, the material and equipment is nice and clean....great service! The staff there is very helpful and friendly will definitely Come here first when we plan other Big Events!
5	Kris was very knowledgeable, efficient, and quick to respond to my many questions regarding renting a tent for my wedding.  I would choose them over Classic Party Rentals any day just based on my customer experience alone.  They make you feel like they truly care about having you as a customer, and go above and beyond to help you.
