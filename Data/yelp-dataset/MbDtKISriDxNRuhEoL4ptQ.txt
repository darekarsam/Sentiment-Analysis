4	Very nice church, one lady seems to REALLY like it, as she is always yelling after the pastor says something she agrees with. lol. maybe if I bring a dozen donuts next time I'm here I can keep her busy with them so I can concentrate on the sermon. :)
5	More than church, its family.Biblically sound and effectively delivered inspired messages from Pastor Terry.  But what makes this a great church are the people who care and are warm.  There are currently two campuses, one in Scottsdale and the other in Mesa with several services on Sunday and one Saturday night in Mesa.  The service is dynamic and worship uplifting.  You always leave better than you came.
5	We attend the Mesa location This church has helped save my husband pastor Terry's messages are so strong and real, he knows how to relate to his audience and the people there are so welcoming and friendly. I love this church
5	City of Grace is an awesome place to come and hear the Word of God.  Pastors Terry and Judith are genuine and sincere with so much love for the people of Arizona and they have such a great passion to reach out and share the Word of God.  Scottsdale, Mesa and Downtown church campuses are all so welcoming and encouraging the communities to come and fellowship and hear the Word of God and grow together.
5	Get ready to catch the fire! This church is alive! Everyone has been extremely friendly. Lots of kids for our children to play with during Sunday school. Messages are always inspiring. It is so exciting to part of a body of believers that is making such a difference and reaching so many lives. Jesus is preached every week!
