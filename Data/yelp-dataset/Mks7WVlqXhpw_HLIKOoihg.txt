5	Recently, we had a company picnic and were in search of dunk tanks & water slides. We came across a couple different companies that provided these; however, we leaned more into Bounce & Rebound due to their low prices. We ended up choosing Bounce & Rebound and they by far exceeded our expectations! They were able to answer all of our questions, they delivered the items in the time promised, they set everything up for us where we wanted it and even tested everything out in front of us & explained to us how to work everything. And needless to say, their prices are great! Our overall experience with Bounce & Rebound was amazing and we will definitely look forward to doing business with them in the future once again!
5	We were searching for a more advanced water slide rental for our teenagers' birthday party.  I stumbled across Bounce and Rebound and was a little unsure of what service to expect as I could find no prior reviews.  BAM !!  They hit it out of the park.  The owners always answer the phone in-person (don't have to wait for a call-back), they suggested the best slide (Fire and Ice), and handled all of the contract and scheduling via their web-site.  A simple, yet forgotten, courtesy of service providers is an advance phone call notifying us that the set-up man was on the way to our house.   Colton called 15 minutes prior and actually arrived a tad EARLY to the promised time.  The 13 teenagers all went crazy with the Fire and Ice water slide and had a blast.   They have already requested the same slide for next year and of course we will be calling Bounce and Rebound.  This is a monster large slide, yet Colton did all of the set-up and take down with no issues.   Highly recommended.
5	Perfect for our son's birthday!  They showed up on time and the unit was awesome!
5	Easy to order online, and they called the day before to confirm delivery details. They were friendly, on time and we didn't have any issues! I would definitely recommend them.
