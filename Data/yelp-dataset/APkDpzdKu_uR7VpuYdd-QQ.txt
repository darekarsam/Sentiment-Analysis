5	Nice brand new store that looks immaculately clean. Shelves are stocked full of products. Staff is very friendly and wants to help.
4	Staples is back! I am so glad it is back across the street from where I work again. That makes it so much easier. It was gone for about 6 months or so.The new store is very nice. Much better organized. The first few isles are only half size shelves so you aren't lost in a jungle of tall shelves or looking to great heights to find things. Everything is right there. Nice carpet on the floor. Overall just a very nice looking store much better than the old one.They open at 8am which is very convenient. Plus did I mention that they are right across the street from where I work. Yay Staples. Welcome back to the neighborhood.
1	As a preface, the actual store part of this Staples is really nice & the people are quite friendly.I'm not usually one to complain, but after spending 45 minutes or more meticulously organizing my presentation on Staples.com, then paying an extra $5 to have it "rushed" you would expect your presentation to be correct & ready at the time quoted. I was quoted 7:30. At 7:45 they handed me an order. I say "an" order, because it sure wasn't mine. None of my pages were two sided (as I specified), there were about twenty copies of the same 4 pages (which were only supposed to be two double sided ones), they were missing two whole files from the order I submitted, & they used the wrong paper to boot. They literally got nothing correct. I stood there and walked the counter guy through exactly what I needed. All that online ordering time was a complete waste apparently. So now, at 8:30, an hour after I was supposed to have my order ($5!) I am finally leaving the Staples print center. The young man behind the counter offered nothing more than a "Sorry 'bout that". I didn't ask, but a refund of the "rush" fee might have been a nice gesture.First & last time I ever print things here!
