1	This store carries a very limited supply of shoes and clothing and not the hip, cool items offered on the New Balance website.  It's independently owned and they will not place special orders from New Balance and have it shipped to the store.  They just want to sell you the overpriced, outdated merchandise in stock.  Note to self ... never shop here in the future!!!
5	It's a great store, the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable. Also great prices and specials.
3	Wish to store was a little bigger. Not much of a shoe selection. Waited too long to be helped. Sales team not very friendly. Very clean and nicely set up.
