5	These guys are OUTSTANDING!!! I was in Vegas last week for vacation and I (stupidly) backed my new 2010 Jetta TDI Cup Edition into an old Jaguar.  Nothing happened to the Jag but I had some paint damage (chips) to the bumper.  Since I was staying another 2 days I called around looking for a VW auto body specialist.  Well, I found them.  Not only did they perfectly fix my bumper, they also added a coating under the front facia (similar to Rhino Lining) to protect the underside of the bumper.  They did this at a MORE than fair price and did it in under 2 days!!!  I had the car in time to return home.  I have a 2006 Z06 Corvette I am brining to Vegas for them to clear coat!TKRidgecrest, CA
5	Serious professionals and they did such an incredible job with repairing the front end of my car. They kept me informed during the entire process. I hope I never have to have my car repaired again but if I need to - I am going here. This family owned business really knows how to treat their customers. I am very happy and satisfied with the entire experience.
5	A shout-out to Proficient Auto Body for the great work yesterday. Had my rear bumper swapped out within a half-day, and terrific staff, to boot.
