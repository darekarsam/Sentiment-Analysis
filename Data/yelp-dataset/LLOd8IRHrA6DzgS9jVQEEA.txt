5	Clean, friendly, reasonably priced, laundromat.Lots of machines.I've tried several laundromats, but Quick Spin is the best in the area.
3	For the most part this is a great laundry mat it's pretty clean and cheap getting the job done. But the few times that I have been in there a young lady who works there has had her young child with her which made it a tad bit unpleasant. The daughters has screamed and cried while the mother has been helping customers. She's run around the laundry mat causing the mother to have to stop what she's doing to to case after her and you can visibly see the mother get upset with this. I've also seen the mother washing her own clothes while on the clock causing customers to have to wait in her to finish...this is the only reason I don't give this place 5 stars because that's honestly the only issues I have with the place.
