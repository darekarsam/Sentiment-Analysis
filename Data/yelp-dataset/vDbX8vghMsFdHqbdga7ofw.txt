2	This place is overrated. I will admit its like 3.30 but where's the homebaking?? I liked this place on FB a while ago after reading about how great it is so i get regular updates on what they're baking for the day. Batches of scones, brownies and loaf cakes. It's been on my 'must try' list for a while. So... I trek over town on my day off for a relaxing tea and cake and.... NO CAKE!!! Harrumph! :(The place is weird, seats uncomfortable and it looks like rabid dogs (or children*) have had a fight over over a scone by the looks of all the crumbs and raisins all over the floor (now stuck to the bottom of my Kenneth Cole handbag!). The floor is grubby and the tables dirty. I feel conned. In huff.* obv the children wouldn't be rabid. Maybe ;)
5	Amazingly good coffee best I had in Edinburgh. Friendly and polite staff, small cafe with a limited menu. Highly recommended for breakfast
5	Best traditional espresso drinks in Edinburgh. The sandwiches and pastries are a must as well.
4	Had time to waste so this coffee shop was close enough to walk from Haymarket. Has Wifi but I didn't use it. Delicious decaf coffee but surprised there was only one croissant and chocolate cake to eat at 2pm! There are closer independent coffee shops to Haymarket so will try them next time.
