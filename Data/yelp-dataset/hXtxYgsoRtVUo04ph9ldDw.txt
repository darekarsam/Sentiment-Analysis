5	I rode this shuttle to Vegas for less than a $100. The driver was courteous and well-trained,  and pointed out scenery and landmarks along the way. It ran on time, and was clean and comfortable. I will definitely use them again.
5	It's the first and foremost company providing individual trips.Thanks to them to start such a concept.Usually there are only charters available nearby (that too only for groups)  , for people like us who have to travel own their own for sight seeing or not accompanying friends or business travel or weekend getaway. Friends this is a nice company. Usually phone is picked up by Fay, you might slightly feel language issue ,however she is very nice and is accommodating, They do trips from Phoenix to Las Vegas in a clean , smelling normal,comfortable Mercedes Benz Van. You can do 1 way or round trip.I took my round trip at $99(specials), which is affordable. You reach from Phoenix to Las Vegas in 5 hours. They take 1 stop for 10 minutes at Chevron Gas Station for getting fresh and sipping coffee. Robert was a nice driver , told about sites and lanscapes while driving on his way. Drove very safely.At the Start of the Journey (morning) :PHOENIX STOP -  ALOFT Hotel Phoenix Airport - 4450 E Washington St - Departs @ 8:00AMAt the End of the Car Drive Journey (afternoon) :LAS VEGAS STOP - Bellagio  (Flamingo Rd Entrance) - 3600 S Las Vegas Blvd Departs @ 2:00PMIf you want to be picked up from your place they charge extra 15 $ for Tempe.,Arizona.Very nice initiate started by them for individuals like us who travel on their own, but go in a group. I recommended them to start something for San Diego and Los Angeles as well. I hope they do in coming times.
