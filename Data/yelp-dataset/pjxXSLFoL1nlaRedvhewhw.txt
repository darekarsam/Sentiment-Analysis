4	Trina's Thrift is a treasure hunter's paradise, consolidated down from two stores, there are a multitude of items hidden in every nook and cranny. Trina, herself is a down to earth mom of four beautiful children who are her world. Collecting antiques, recycled goods and antique vending machines is her pasttime.  I have found a treasure trove of books and household goods. She takes all donations and gives back to the community. Recently, on a Tuesday, I witnessed her helping a fire victim resupply. When asked about what was going on, I discovered that Trina works with local churches and agencies to help people who are in dire straits. Families who have lost everything in house fires to homeless people looking to improve thier situation. I always stop by once a week because of the great finds but more so because here is a small business owner who gives back to her community out of love. Check it out on the Trail, a rare jewel  that's hidden in the desert.
1	Lots of overpriced junk.  I don't know why I keep wasting my time.  Been there at least four times and never found anything.    I make the round of thrift stores for my business and I rarely can't find anything but not so at Trina's.  Nothing even remotely worth their prices.  More like what's left at a yard sale after it's been picked over.
