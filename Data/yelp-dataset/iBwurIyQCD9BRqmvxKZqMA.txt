5	Just purchased several appliances from Queen City.  I primarily worked with John at the location on Queen City Drive.  John was great to work with!  Actually, everyone who helped me were all top notch!What a great experience shopping for appliances!  I imagine this is how appliance shopping used to be.  Great selection in the showroom, knowledgeable and helpful sales folks who negotiated good pricing and delivery folks were good as well.  I cannot imagine a better place to buy appliances in the Charlotte area.
1	CUSTOMERS BEWARE.. THERE ARE THIEVES WORKING IN THIS STORE.  I live out of state and gave my credit card number to the sales manager at this store location. His name is Robbie ..After one week.. I had over 2k dollars of fraud charged on my credit card at North Carolina Gas stations.  This has been turned over for investigation.
5	My wife and I ordered a new washer and dryer from Queen City and everything went as smoothly as possible. The sales rep, Mike Coscarelli, was real easy-going and not in-your-face and the units were delivered to our ordered and delivered to our home within a week. Delivery and set-up went smoothly, too; the delivery crew was on-time, professional, and set up our new washer and dryer quickly. They even discovered we had ordered parts we didn't need and made a note on our receipt to get a refund.We like to support local businesses, and it's nice when the quality of service is as good as or better than the big chains. Queen City didn't disappoint!
5	Worked with Clay to purchase six different appliances. He was helpful and knowledgeable, and professional throughout. Importantly, he and Queen City have been helpful in providing service after the sale, for these appliances and even one that we had bought someplace else. We'd recommend them over the national big box stores, hands down.
