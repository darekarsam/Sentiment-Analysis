1	Worst company to do business with.  One person tells you one thing and then another tells you something else.  Rude, uncooperative, lack of customer service, a real waste of time.  And don't ever get caught up in a bundle with them.  I gave one star because Yelp wouldn't let me give zero.
4	Did a great installing and am really pleased with the new tv  prism service.  Install crew was professional and very helpful. Century link is much faster than cox even when I ordered the same speed from both.  So far so good.
1	Horrible Horrible Horrible!!! That is all I can say. The install guys are great but when it comes to billing that are totally clueless.  I was quoted 69.94 when I signed up and now my bill has gone up to 132.00 and I have to call and complain each month. And I thought Cox was bad.....
1	They get one star because I can't give NONE! We decided to get a land line last week & it's been a nightmere! The phone still doesn't work...I've had to call 6x & repeat the story each time to a different person.... Is there another option in SCW???
1	I give these people "0" stars, had to select one star or I could not post this message, they are not worth even one star. You have been warned!!Century Link provides the worst tv and Internet service, I am not surprised they have only a one star rating. There are always problems with our tv connections, constantly having to re-set the cable box and the internet is incredibly slow!!When we signed up for this service we were given all this B.S. about how much faster their internet is and all the channels we would be getting with their cable TV what a crock! On Demand want a joke and half of the cable channels they provide are nothing but duplicates and we actually lost programming we had with COX! Again our service is out, I am so fed up with the service they are providing I am going to cancel this contract!
1	if i could give century link a negative 5 stars i would, in every aspect.
