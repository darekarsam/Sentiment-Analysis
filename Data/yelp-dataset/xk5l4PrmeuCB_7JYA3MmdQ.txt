5	A great learning environment for children.  My daughter has thrived at this school, I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a preschool or kindergarten.
5	Great school and awesome environment for learning. Their adherence to Montessori detail is excellent. My daughter loves it there and she has thrived.
5	We sent both of our children to Spirit of Hope and they could not have been more prepared academically, as well as socially. Our boys are now in first and third grade, and every teacher has commented on their focus and outstanding behavior. Rick, Colleen and Kym are some of the most dedicated, patient and involved teachers you could ever hope to have. Their classroom is just as much about teaching respect, as it is about the schoolwork. They genuinely care about the well-being of their students and the network of families around them. We very highly recommend Spirit of Hope to any pre-school or kindergarten parents. You will not be disappointed.
5	This school has been such a blessing to our family!  As an educator and curriculum designer myself, I have very high expectations when it comes to academics and the learning environment;  Rick, Colleen and Kym have exceeded those.  At this school you know exactly what you are getting each year--three thoughtful, intelligent, and engaging Master Teachers.  My daughter (age 4) comes home and "teaches" me all about the planets, dinosaurs, and the world around her.  The work that comes home is meaningful and age-appropriate.  There is a spark in her when it comes to learning that I have never seen before...it reminds me of the few and rare teachers I had growing up that were able to ignite that love for learning in me.  Whatever it is, it is rare, and these three teachers have it!  How wonderful that my daughter gets to experience education at its finest at this young of an age.
