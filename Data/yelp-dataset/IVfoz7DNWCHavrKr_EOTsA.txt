5	I came in today to ship some packages because the post office was a mad house.  It was busy for a kinko's, but I was helped promptly and efficiently.  I get a discount with my company to ship things here, so it is a great alternative to waiting in line at the post office.  I have also used this location to fax and it was fast and simple to do.
4	I had to mail my books back to school and the service was amazing. They got my shipping label printed and all I had to buy was a $2 package. I've come here on several occasions for copies, printing, etc. and enjoy the well kept facility. Right off the access road and easy parking. Great place to get all my shipping and printing needs taken care.
1	don't come here for photos for your passport it's a big rip off $16.95 avoid it like the plague everything is overpriced!
1	Really feeling like I got ripped off here. I went here to ship a package via FedEx and decided to have them pack and ship for me. It was a 20x20x12" box and some bubble wrap and packing paper. Total Charge for this service; Almost $25 with tax. The box itself can be purchased for $2-3 online or local moving companies. My fault for not doing a little research ahead of time. Oh, but I have a Packing Guarantee against damage. Geez. All of that said, the girl that helped me was very nice as she took my $25 for probably $3-4 in packing supplies and 5min of her time.And I also have to add that their internet/computer is a border line scam. Seems like its purposely slow to they can really rack up the charges for using it. I had to refresh the page several times to get it to work and was operating at a speed that reminded me of a 14.4k modem from the 1990s. NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER HERE!!!!Side note. I just had my local UPS Store pack the same exact item. $13 for box and packing.
