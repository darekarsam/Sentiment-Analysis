4	I just had a hugh take home ribs, greens and Mac cheese dish. It is the first yummy god like this I have had in Pittsburgh. Very very good
5	Soul Food Connection is the absolute real deal! Great food and good people in an honest independently owned location. I love the fried chicken, black eyed peas and greens. Go there! It's take out mainly but you can eat there if you like.
4	Got a 10pc fried chicken family meal w/ collards, yams, and four rolls for about $16. Food was excellent, staff was friendly. I plan to return after realizing it's a short walk.
4	If you haven't had fried chicken at the soul food connection then you haven't had fried chicken.  They cook it up like they invented it!Expect steaming moist crispy perfectly spiced breasts and wings, tender corn bread to soak up the sauce, and gooey baked Mac and cheese to show you how it's meant to taste.While many soul food spots are just rib shacks with a grill, a counter, and bare walls, this has plenty of seating, jazz posters, cozy wallpaper and framed newspaper articles about their well deserved success.  It's owned by a very friendly couple whose kindness and love for the customers can be tasted in every bite.  After soul food, I normally get the itis and have a coma/siesta, but after lunch here I felt awake and energized!  A clear testament to their natural ingredients and home made recipes.Why not 5 stars?  To me, greens and bbq ribs are the pinnacle of soul food.  The collared greens didn't taste freshly made and the ribs were good, but not great.  Smokey but a little dry and the sauce was too mild and light bodied for my taste.  Still, for catering or BBQ, you can get 50 chicken pieces for under $50 and no one does fried chicken or hospitality with more soul than the soul connection!
5	I love their food I get the fried chicken wings, yams & green beans!! delicious. I eat there all the time!!!!
