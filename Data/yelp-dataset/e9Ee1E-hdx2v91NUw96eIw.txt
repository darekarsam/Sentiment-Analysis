5	SImple place but excellent kebabs. Tender meat and spectacular rice & soup
5	Although the decoration is not fancy but the food quality is really nice and the staff are friendly. Also the prices and portions seams reasonable.
5	By far my favorite iranian restaurant, i've been to ALL of them and this one is hands down the best. Service might be slow sometimes but oh the food is absolutely delicious, I always order the mix koobideh sometimes the joojeh and the salad dressing is out of this world. Highly highly recommended.
5	Fantastic koobideh! Been to a bunch of Persian places in NYC and Toronto and this place ranks highly. The meat is very good quality and BBQ'ed to perfection. They also serve Persian tea for free!
