4	Yeah, Jack in the Box, 4 stars...So, where is my Assclown tiara? I intend on wearing it all day for reviewing a corporate giant like Jack in the Box. However, where does one get a real ice cream shake from an independent in less than 5 minutes? Maybe not the best testing criteria, but I intend on winning the argument because it is my review!  Seriously, Jack in the Box has maraschino cherries and real whip cream on their luscious chocolate milkshakes. I can't speak for anything else on the menu but if you are craving a chocolate milkshake with real ice cream- hey, they came through with the cherry and whip cream, I have no reason to believe its not real ice cream and not some strange milk solids and it taste like bliss. So, blow through drive thru, treat yourself to some real whip cream and a cherry!   Truth in advertising alone is well worth 4 stars.
