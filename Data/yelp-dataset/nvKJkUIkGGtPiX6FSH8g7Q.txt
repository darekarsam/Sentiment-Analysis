4	I noticed this little Chinese place open recently near my work. Been here twice already and will go back. A nice selection of Chinese dishes as well as some fusion Chinese/Thai (denoted with a green mark on their menu).Overall, pretty good for Chinese food. Well prepared and good ingredients. Better quality than the other asian restaurants nearby. Nice and clean decor. Great lunch special that includes a soup and spring roll. All well priced.The two dishes I had so far were:Chicken and Shrimp Fried Noodles, Cantonese style. Pretty standard chinese dish. Was prepared well and tasty.Chicken Pad Thai. Which was one of their fusion dishes. Wasn't much to look at but had a nice taste to it. I enjoyed it, however, I was hoping it leaned more on the Thai side, or just a full Thai version.My co-workers had General Tao and Beef and Brocolli which looked good and was well liked. I'll definitely come back here for my work lunches!
2	Update: Food quality has degraded since my first review. All my co-workers agree it's not as good as it used to be. Pretty bummed out about it because it was a good place to get some decent chinese food near our work. As of Sept 2, it was closed and says it's "under new management"
3	On the plus side... Enough employees to make extra-fresh hand-made Japanese-style bites. Nicely presented combo-boxes. Very reasonable prices.But... Enough employees to make me question the profitability of this venture. Dreadful lighting.
4	Found the food was good, but the restaurant is now a sushi restaurant...
