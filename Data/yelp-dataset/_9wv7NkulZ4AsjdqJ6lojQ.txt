2	It's safe and OK hotel, but nothing is spectacular. Their location is not so convenient, kind of far from the main LV street, especially when you go to Las Vegas Convention Center.
2	Just not a good location, although you wonder why. No tram nearby.  So you have to drive to it since it ain't walking distance to anyone.  Casino is small.  Not noteworthy.  I guess when they renovate, I may change my mind.
2	This hotel is old and outdated. It needs to be torn down and rebuilt.The non-smoking rooms smell of mold. The spout in the bathtub fell off when I touched it. We saw a leaky roof in the hallway.  It's probably the cheapest hotel on the Strip though. So it's a good place to stay if you can't afford something better.
