2	I go to Fabricville for only the most basic of things:Lining fabricNotions like buttons and claspsThread and commercial patternsOther than that, I almost always pick up the 3 for 1 pieces of fabric (often under 2$ - meaning I get almost 3 yards for 2$) which I use for small projects. I also go when they have the 3 for 1 sales on fabric, if I can find a fabric I actually like, it makes for a great deal.I only ever go to Fabricville because there aren't many other options in Montreal, and so I resort to ordering most of the designer fabric I like through one of the many reputable and independent sellers on Etsy.
4	I was dying to buy some fabrics as I just bought new sewing machine. Searching through internet, finally arrived at fabricville. Woh...I should have known this place before. it is so closed to Metro Namur. Quickly entering, I realized there are so many different fabrics of different origins. Some are quite cheap such as 14 $ for a meter of beautiful lace+ 50% discount; but some are unreasonably expensive such as 18$ for meter of cotton. But, what can I say? This is as good as it gets as there are very few options in Montreal. The lady who cut items for us are really helpful and working nonstop for the customers. I saw many ladies coming to buy fabrics. If you take your times, you will be able to find good quality products at some reasonable price to make many creative projects: quilting, blouses, dresses and home decor. I just only want to suggest, store owner should go to Asia and look for more variety for better options.
