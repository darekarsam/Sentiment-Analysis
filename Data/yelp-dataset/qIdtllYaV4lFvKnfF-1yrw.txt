5	Great service! Family owned, they always greet me with a smile. I love this little shop they have everything I need for my lumpia and it's on my way home. I stock up on their little iced coffees too. Mmmmm.
5	Nice people and very clean! I will absolutely be shopping here from now on
5	Nice family owned filipino store...not big but makes up for the drive to Chinatown. got some Shanghai lumpia for appetizers.
