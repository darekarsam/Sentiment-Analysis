4	People who run this place are really nice. Always helpful. They saw me loading my laundry and suggested a way to save me money. The machines are less expensive than other laundromat a in the area.

2	This place is convenient because you pull up and the washers are right there.  The 80 pound washer was worth the $7 for the amount of laundry I had, but that was it.The machines are old, and I was not happy with the way it cleaned my clothes.  I normally go to another laundromat which was closed for some reason.The owner was nice, I assume it was the owner.A lot of the dyers were broken, and many didn't show the time.  My clothes were still covered in lint and fur when taken out the dryer.  I had a dryer turn off every few minutes because it was over heated, and I didn't know how much time I had left because it didn't show it.   The dryers were in the very back, and you had hardly any room to get them, because the folding tables were like 3 feet in front of them.   The folding tables were very small.They sold laundry soap, but the prices were outrageous.  It said free Wifi but I could not get it to work, granted I didn't ask for a password if needed.
