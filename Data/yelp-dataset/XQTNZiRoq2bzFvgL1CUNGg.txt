4	Translation: Potato and ChiveNow that you know what it means, can you picture the Mr. Potato Heads that adorn the drink cooler?Outside of steakhouses and Wendy's, I hadn't given a baked potato much thought. And a whole restaurant specializing in the stuffing and topping of the spuds? Well, that's new to me. And I have to say, they do a pretty good job. The baked potatoes come in regular or large sizes. The potatoes are fluffy on the inside and dry and almost crispy on the skin outside. After ordering from a chalkboard of choice (Greek; pork + apricot; curry; vegetarian; chili), and choosing from a selection of sauces that range from parsley and coriander to roasted pepper and garlic we sat down at one of their few tables in the small storefront. The verdict? My vegetarian chili with roasted pepper sauce was less chili-stew than I had envisioned - it was almost dry. But the flavours were bold, spice was mild. My original choice - pork and apricot - was sold out, which lends me to believe that it's a popular and therefore a good choice. I've been debating with myself: Was it worth the $5.95? If you're craving carbs, sure. And if you like novelties like this, yup. Maybe it's just my own personal preference, but there was something slightly unsatifying about it; likely not enough sauce for my liking. A side dish like a small salad or even some lettuce might have helped woo me with presentation too.
