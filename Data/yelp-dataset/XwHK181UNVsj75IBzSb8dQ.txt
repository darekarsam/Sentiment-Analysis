5	This is where it all started!! Apparently this is the first and original dagwood! I'm a huge fan of dagwood. Previously i was a subway fan but i discover dagwood from a friend and wow i have never been to a subway or quizno ever again!!My all time favorite is the grill chicken with mayo + dagwood sauce + salt and pepper! I have been eating to dagwood since 4 years and i am very lucky since i live in the west island so there is around 3 dagwood that i always go to. I also got a part time job in south shore and when i discover they open one their ( their first one ) wow was I happy :) If you like sandwich you must try dagwood! the original dagwood sandwich is also good but chicken is simply the best!

4	I can't give 5 stars for a meat slicer, bread, and raw veggies, but consider this the strongest 4 star review possible. This is just good, consistent, fresh-tasting food. And I like the $5 footlong promotions, but I just can't bring myself to try the mortadella. The cross-section just looks too creepy for my tastes. I should say, though, that I think that the Dagwoods sauce (original) is worth 5 stars. Yum, yum. yum. Simple, cheap, can't go wrong. (though I did order the chicken sub once and found that to be very skimpy.)
4	Have never been disappointed with Dagwoods. They always change the sandwich to just what i want. They are quick and have never had a bad order. The service is great and you can be out in less than five minutes with your meal. I usually get the club with extra turkey instead of ham. Their soups are not bad and the cookies are all good. Beats most fast food burger places!
