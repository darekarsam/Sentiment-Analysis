5	Best. Service. Ever. Do not even consider another electrician until you have met Tony and his Meade team.Tony (owner of Meade) came over on a Saturday and installed 4 ceiling fans for us.  I could not have asked for better service and professionalism.   He took time to explain wiring, balancing, and other things that I was not aware of with the fans.  I will NEVER have to look for another electrician after getting this impeccable service.  Plus, the price was considerably cheaper than all other quotes I received.  Best service for easily the best price.  I am lucky to have found Meade, and I would highly recommend you do the same.-Cole
5	Rarely do you ever call an experience with a plumber or electrician pleasant or desirable, because most times, you're calling them in emergent situations and most times, it's going to cost you time and money. Without a doubt, today was definitely a most unexpected and pleasant experience!So, my regular electrician was MIA. In sheer desperation, I called Meade. I can't speak to the residential in-home service practice of this electrician, but the fact that Meade tried to resolve my problem over the phone instead of insisting on showing up just to charge me a service call fee for an issue they could have resolved over the phone makes this guy all aces in my book! Not only was the man courteous, he really did solve my problem over the phone, free of charge. He saved me about $65, so the least I can do is leave this review and hope that others have as pleasant an experience as I had today! P.S. It was the reset button.
5	Took the time to explain to me over the phone why kitchen outlets might be out, tried resetting breakers as suggested (although not tripped) and worked ... saved me $$$, will def. call again for any future work
