1	DO NOT. I repeat. DO NOT take your vehicle to this sun devil auto. Horrible atmosphere all they want are your keys to your car and the money afterwards for the pathetic job of "mechanic work" save your time, money and patience and take it else where
5	I have been doing business with Sun Devil Auto for over 14 yrs. I took my vehicle  to the auto repair place that was at that location, prior to Sun Devil Auto I decided to stay with Sun Devil Auto because the mechanics , from the prior repair shop stayed.  I am glad that I stayed with Sun Devil Auto. Jeff and the crew are  professional and courteous people. When I  have taken my vehicle in for oil changes and lubes, the mechanics do an inspection on the vehicle. If they find any problems, Jeff is notified and he lets me know  of the problems and even shows me the problem. It is always up to me what and if repairs are made. At one point I had to have a major trans repair and Jeff, rented me a vehicle to use for three days, free of charge.       Work on vehicle is always guaranteed and they back it.      I have 123,000 miles on my vehicle and it runs great, thanks to  the mechanics and Jeff.      I would not take my vehicle any place else                           Sincerely  Bill Y
5	Sun Devil Auto was very helpful. I asked for a radiator flush but they knew I was selling my car soon and he said lets just check out the cooling system first.  All it needed was a radiator cap. I was very appreciative!!
