4	I stopped here after driving home from Ny state over the Christmas holiday through that blizzard (it was all good till i hit Jamestown, Erie was a mess)... and my already shoddy wipers froze over and over, and then the wire cut through the rubber and hit the glass...oops. Maybe I procrastinated.I love these guys how hard is it to find an auto parts store smack in the middle of the city 1. 2. They replaced my windshield wipers for 10-15$ cheaper than pep boys would. The guy assisting me was super friendly, helped me figure out what size wipers I needed, and he put them on for me in a flash. I'll be back.
4	These guys are always helpful when I go in.  I here to ask for Rob, but I have found everyone to be pretty decent.
5	I stopped at this location because of a driver's side wiper blade that was not making contact in my line of sight across the windshield (had on for less than one month). Joe exceeded my expectations when he took a look at the wiper blade and tested different brands to help fix the issue. I will definitely return to this location for the friendly service and attention to customer needs.
5	Not only are these guys friendly, but they know what they're doing! I had some car trouble last night and needed AAA to give me a jump home. This morning, my battery light wasn't on so I wanted to check to see how my battery was doing before purchasing a new one for $200 (isn't owning an Audi fun!?). Not only did the employee check my battery, but he offered to do a full system check as well totally free of charge. He was super nice and didn't make it seem like I was a bother. It's cold and rainy so he easily could have been irritated, but never let it show. Great job! You all always do such a great job!
