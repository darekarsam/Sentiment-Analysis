5	Had some family pictures taken by Kara that turned out great!  Even with a grouchy baby she was able to catch the moments that made our little girl seem pleasant.  Competitive prices without compromising quality.  I recommend her to everyone.
5	Our family has worked with Kara a few times. She is our family photographer of choice. So easy to work with, provides BEAUTIFUL pictures, and one of the more affordable photographers for the quality of product that she provides. I would highly recommend her to anyone in the East Valley area.
5	I emailed Kara to inquire about her newborn sessions and received a timely response from her.  Kara was extremely helpful in answering all of my questions and she was also flexible with setting up a time to meet.  She was so sweet, gentle, and patient with my newborn!  Our pictures turned out beautifully and I am look forward to setting up a family session with her. I highly recommend Kara to anyone!
5	I am repeatedly amazed by the talent Kara has behind her camera! I've used several photographers, and my family keeps coming back to her year after year. It's for a good reason! Kara is so easy and fun to work with. She makes photographing children look like a piece of cake, and that is no easy thing! I really appreciate how patient and caring she is with my kids, and she has even brought them a treat for behaving so well. Kara is great about asking you what you want out of your photo shoot, and going the extra mile to get you the different settings and groups that you were hoping for. You really get your moneys worth with her, and she is so affordable! Seeing our pictures afterwards is always so exciting, and we always come away with some amazing pictures. I've had many friends and family ask "Who is your photographer?", that's how good she is. All her photos are so high quality, and you can tell that she really spends time on making them look great. I recommend her to everyone. She is fantastic!
