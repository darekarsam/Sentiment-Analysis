5	This place is fabulous. It's a boutique for plus sized women. I found some great items here. They even have jewelry. The clothes are great and definitely for the woman who wants to look stylish. The people who work there are very nice and helpful. And the BEST thing about it is the price. It's sooooo affordable.
5	I love the hospitality when I walk in.. And love the fact that I'm a last minute shopper so when I come I always walk out with the right thing with out needing to shop anywhere else.... You have the best prices for thick women in Las Vegas.... I love love your taste , your hospitality, your prices, and your store
5	Great place!!! Prices are very affordable and the jewelery is better priced than charming charlies!!! The gal at the desk is very helpful and sweet!!! The dress i chose was a little low cut so she gave me a couple safety pins!! :) thank you!!! Above and beyond!!
