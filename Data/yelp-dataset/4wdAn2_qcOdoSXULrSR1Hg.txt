5	Great prices on rentals and tables and chairs! No other Party Supply/Rental store I've seen has this great of a deal! They also have jumpers that comes with a great deal of candy and a pinata. The pinatas are very nice compared to the ones at the super market. Well worth the price! The place is family owned and very very friendly. The lady who owns the place seemed like she had great relationship with her customers. I love supporting places like this! Places like this makes a community feel real!
5	I have been going to A&C Party Supplies for years for tables and chairs for our parties and even yard sales.  Their prices are the best in the area and the people who work at and own the place are very nice.  I recommend them to anyone who needs equipment like this.  My employer is going to use them in a couple weeks for a 30 person event too.  Great experience every time!
4	Really do not know how to rate this place? We were out shopping around for a pinata, we are having a birthday party for both of our foster daughters. A & C had a very small selection of pinatas, they were nice but not what we were looking for. Now with that said, this place is very small but offers so much. You can rent chairs, tables, bouncers, and much more. They have plenty of party supplies to offer. I would love to have a business like this where we live. However they didn't have what we needed, so with that only reason this is why it's getting a 4-star. The people in this area doesn't realize what they have over here, it's a great place to have locally.
