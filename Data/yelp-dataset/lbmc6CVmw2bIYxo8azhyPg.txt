3	Best it seems to get in here early if you want a seat. We arrived around 9pm so only stayed for one pint as it was standing room only by that time. Reasonable atmosphere though, good range of ales and the bag of books I managed to leave behind was safe under the bar until I went to retrieve it the following night (when it looked to again be impossible to get a seat and that was at 8 on a Sunday) so probably somewhere I'd frequent again.
4	Fantastic boozer, very much felt like an old mans pub but then we were introduced to the rear of the bar. Huge fire, massive comfy couches and the day we were there on a random Thursday, we were treated to two guys playing with a banjo and a guitar. There was a great sense of ease about he whole pub and so different.
5	Great wee pub, especially on Sunday nights as the Jammy Devils play every week! Went in a couple of Thursday nights ago and they had a different band in as well who were really good. Amazing strawberry beer on tap - Fruli! Tastes divine!
