5	Typical Chevron Gas Station. Gotta love the super cheap gas prices in vegas...im talking like SUPER DUPER CHEAP GAS PRICES. Its a tradition for me to fill at this station because I refuse to fill my car up with those random/unheard named gas stations/companies.My first stop in vegas is Lees Liqours....this is my 2nd.UNTIL THEN!! ^-^
4	$3.69 for gas yes of course I need it, well I just drove from Los Angeles area and just arrived to Las Vegas. First stop was the outlets and the second stop was this Chevron gas station.A lot of people were getting gas but it still went by quickly and I really don't have any complaints about this place. Just remember to pump your gas in Vegas before you start your long drive back home. You don't want to be in the middle of the dessert with no gas...that is just not good.
3	Must be the tourist station. A lot of inconsiderate people. But, it is a good one. Just try to go when its not so busy
