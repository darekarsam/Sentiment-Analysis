4	A gigantor Canadian Tire with helpful staff who are patient and giggly with your wisecracking, receipt-inspecting Mum. Wide aisles excellent for pushing carts piled high with bookshelves and paint cans, and for contemplating future home projects at your own speed. The lights went on and off randomly when we were there recently, and not near closing time, but aside from that, plenty fine. Lots of parking, close to Marche Central.
5	Super friendly staff!!! They take their time to explain the situarion. The prices for the auto service are a little high but I belive it's worth it. They seem to know what they are doing.
4	Love Canadian tire just for their sales! Always worth it when you keep an eye out on their specials and you get CRAZY expensive stuff at 65% off!!!
