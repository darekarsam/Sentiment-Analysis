5	My wife first took her car here & got the mini-detail. It was an excellent job, especially for the money. We began bringing our trucks here soon after. They do an amazing job every time. They all, including the owner, greet you buy name after the first visit (maybe they just remember me because my trucks are always filthy!) It's the only place we take our trucks now.
5	The owner, Chris, is a great example of how a small business owner hustles to make his business a success. Wash n Roll do a great job at a fair price.
5	Excellent service, attention to detail and friendly staff.Great value at $10.00. Will use them again.
5	I already mentioned that the owner came out and greeted me and gave me his card, when I tried to get my car  hand washed and waxed, as it is new.  They were closed do to the threat of rain. Took it in today, an I am very pleased with the outcome. They did a beautiful job of cleaning and waxing.  I will continue to use them and recommend their services!
