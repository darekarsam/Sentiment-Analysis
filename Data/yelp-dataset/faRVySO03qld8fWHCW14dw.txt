1	Did not have good service. Found out the week before my wedding that I was allergic to soy so I called the Monday before my wedding asking her to make a soy free cake. I went the day before and picked it up and double checked that it was all soy free and she didn't change one thing. Then said I hope you don't get sick. Needless to say I didn't get to eat any of my wedding cake. But thankfully my family made me a soy free cake the night before so I could have some cake at my wedding.
5	Our cake was delicious and beautiful!  We had made a couple last minute requests of Aurora and she changed them with no problem.  It was everything we wanted!  Thank you so much for helping make our day so special and our tummies so happy!
5	Our wedding cake was delicious and stunning. Everyone wanted to know what the flavors were and who made it. I only wish I could have eaten more.
