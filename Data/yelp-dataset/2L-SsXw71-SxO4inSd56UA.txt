1	This place is by far the worst! This is my 3rd time trying to get in to see the Dr.  All 3 times I've had to wait over an hour in the waiting room. The first 2 times I left out of frustration and I'm about to do it again. They make sure to collect your copayment before hand. Rude! Unbelievably the worst customer service. I will never come here again... Unless you nothing better to do with your time, I suggest you don't come here either.
5	I've been in to see Dr. Newton once, and I've called the office a handful of times. So far, they've been very responsive, answered the phone promptly, and been courteous. They were also quick to call with any lab results. My appointment was easy and painless. Dr. Newton is friendly, efficient, and just gets to the point. It's also been really easy getting prescription renewals from them. I have no complaints! One thing to note is that they do NOT accept credit cards for co-payments so you'll have to bring cash or a checkbook if your insurance doesn't cover your exams. I'm not counting this against them though because I don't have a co-payment on my insurance.
5	I went in to see Dr Zak today. The staff was all very friendly and discreet. I filled out all my new client paperwork and was brought into the back as soon as it was completed. When Dr Zak came in the room, she started going over my chart and at first I felt as though she was talking down to me and it made me extremely uncomfortable. But as we talked and proceeded with the appt, things seemed to mellow out. She's actually in fact very nice. She is very insightful about certain issues and seemed to care about my well being. I would definitely recommend her to anyone in need of an Obgyn.
