5	I cant believe any one hasnt written an English review about Gerards . originally situated on the same property as the old Ste Rose Motel and Diner and originally owned by Gaston Applements and his son Gerard ,a few years after our family bought the land and properties on Labelle blvd ,Gerards mysteriously caught fire and they moved to a lot a little farther south which was owned then by Gaston, Anyways my brother Angelo and I who worked at the motel and the diner through the years would go to Gerards every day and boy were we pros ,especially Angelo he could out eat me. True story we were about 10 years old and I ate 6 hot dogs ,angelo ate 9 ,and that was the day we helped our father George and couple of our uncles redo part of the shrubs that were behind the Diner and seperating the motel. The burgers were small but they packed it up with cole slaw and onions ,and the potatoes were always plentiful,the hot dogs were steamers and the French guys that worked there the Sancousy brothers were great workers and strong guys , I ended up playing  Juvenile and Juniour football with Eves and his brother Raymond won Mr Canada  thankyou Gerard and thanks Gaston
4	Epicurious and myself were out looking for a fix to satisfy our watering taste buds when Chez Gerards came into our vision. this  little delight is a poutine heaven with in house peeled double fried fries and from the tastes of things their own secret sauce ,their burgers are slider size and it shows that burgers aren't their strong point. but friendly fast service is their strong point . You can tell from the look of the place that the care about who eats at their diner and want you to return again and again with family and friends .
5	Out of all the hot dogs I've had in Montreal/Laval, this one is by far the best. On top of that, the poutine is amazing as well. I also really like that it's a family restaurant, it makes me want to go even more.
