5	Okay, so there's not enough good things I can say about this place. So I'll try to keep to the main ones:1) They offer a service where they do your laundry for you. They wash, dry, and fold your laundry for $0.99 per pound. They even check tags and wash items in delicate that require it, and they provide hangers to hang dress shirts, and such so they do not wrinkle. They only ask that the next time you come, bring the hangers back so they can be reused.2) They are very honest with you about things they may not be able to get out via dry cleaning. They don't shoot rays of sunshine and daisies up your back side to try and get you to use their services.3) Tuesday night is FREE DRYER NIGHT. That's right... you can wash your own clothes, and then use their dryers for FREE. They only ask that you pull your clothes out when the dryer is done. Half price laundry? Thank you very much!4) They're opening a restaurant next to their laundry establishment. Thai food to eat while you do laundry, and they will be serving pho! Very excited!
5	What a clean and wonderful place to do your clothes. We used to go here for years before getting our own machines . However recently due to family illness I was needing help with the amount of laundry that was piling up. They picked up and delivered and perfectly folded and washed everything. I can trust this family with my clothes as I would myself. They are awesome folks I have gone here for years.The value you get for your money is really worth it.. Nice to have a break from your own laundry like a vaca!! Support local family run places!!
