5	This was the second time I had to get my windshield changed in the past two weeks.  The first time, I was not pleased with the company my insurance recommended, so this time I made the decision to use Star Windshield (although they were not on my insurance's preferred list).  They were very friendly and very accommodating as I changed my time and location several times.  Mike came out and took care of my car and he did an awesome job!  I am very pleased. Also, I had my windows tinted at this same location 5 years ago and have not had a single issue yet!
1	These guys do not know what customer service means. I had my windshield replaced there even though they were not on my insurance company's preferred list. Well the joke's on me because now I have bubbles in my windshield and the manager won't fix it.
5	I have had two or three windshields replaced and two windshield chips repaired here over the past few years. I have always found the work and materials to be of high-quality and the price to be right. Highly recommended!
