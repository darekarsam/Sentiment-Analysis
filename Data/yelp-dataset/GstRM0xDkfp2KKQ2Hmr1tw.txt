3	As far as budget accommodations go this place was alright.  The staff is friendly, helpful and flexible.  The dorm rooms themselves probably try and pack a few too many people in to them and the beds can be a very squeeky.  It's located a 7 or so minute walk from the heart of Old Town, which if you're staying for more than 3 or so nights can get a little repetitive.  Overall I'm sure better could be found, but if nothing appeared in a search I'd come back here with no real hang ups
4	First time at a hostel, I was very impressed. Friendly, helpful staff. Free wifi. Felt and looked clean. I stayed in the 18 bedroom, pretty spacious.  They have a neat bar but I used the kitchen to make my own food. Presentation of the food was real nice and respectable like. I would definitely stay here again.
