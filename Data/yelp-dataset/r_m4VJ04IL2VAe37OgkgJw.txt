5	A must SEE!! Dun dun dun, no pun intended!  heh heh.Dr. Manos is awesome! Very personable, like a ole chum from cheers - she knows your name. She spent a great deal of time with me answering my questions and making me feel comfortable.  I bought my new glasses from her and I'm as pleased as can be.

5	Literally the best optometrist I've ever been to. The entire staff was friendly. Dr. Manos was down to earth and engaged. The assistants never rushed us and gave honest opinions on the frames we were choosing. I couldn't believe how reasonable the prices were! I highly recommend this place.
5	Had an incredible visit today with Chrys, my first time, and I have to say it was the best eye doctor appointment I've ever had. Chrys takes time to really explain what's going on with your eyes, why eye drops are needed in Vegas and what kind and why... She's the dr. for my family. Thanks Chrys and staff you're all wonderful!
