4	As the owner of several older motorcycles, and pretty much being mechanically inclined, Suters has been invaluable to me. Sam, who is pretty much in charge of the bone yard side of Sutter's, knows most every part of every bike you could think of, or that matters at least... They keep parts in stock that are hard to find TODAY ( let's be realistic, ever since the Internet came about nothing is hard to find if your little balls have dropped and you can patiently wait for it) and can cut you any gasket you need while you wait. The only negative thing is that most of the bikes in the yard have been picked clean, probably by Sam himself, but that's how he makes his money, for what he has in his barn the prices are very fair, a $45 seat from a 33 year old cycle wont be taped up or missing half a hinge.

They've got two barns full of parts, pretty much anything you need. Sam knows the yard like the back of his hand, and the shop will hook you up with what isn't out in the yard. Prices are decent and the location isn't too far out of the way
5	A little out of town if you live downtown or in Middleton, but worth the drive for the service. I needed to put some tires on my motorcycle and these guys did it quickly and inexpensively. And they did it right. Also, if you work on an older/vintage bike, they have a huge graveyard of bikes in the back. I needed to replace the seat lock on my '73 Honda, and I just went out back and picked around for about 15 minutes, found the exact lock, removed it, and paid about $5 for it. Identical piece would have cost ~$50 on eBay.
