3	Vintage apartments completely remodeled. Covered parking, gated access, new pool, friendly neighborly vibe. Inside we like the polished smooth concrete floors that show the character of the years gone by. Stainless steel appliances and great countertops. The manager is professional and communicates excellently as does Juan the maintenance guy who lives on the property. A good place to call home in downtown Phoenix Az. PS. Have to mention after 1 year of living here we are now dealing with strong 2nd hand smoke coming from the apartment above. This smoke comes in through the ventilation system. My wife has asthma and can no longer stay here. Guess we will have to move on.
2	The place looks awesome.... The remodeling is definitely visually appealing. However, the apartment complex has the original pipes. Sewage water has backed up into bathtubs. My upstairs neighbors leaked into my apartment 8 times. The apartment manager is completely difficult to get a hold of. Plan on seeing her at least an hour later than she schedules you. I have waited 2 and a half. Juan the maintenance man is FANTASTIC and bends over backwards to help everyone at any time of day or night.
