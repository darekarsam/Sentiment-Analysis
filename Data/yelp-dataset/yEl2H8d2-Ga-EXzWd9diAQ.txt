4	This is a fantastic park of mixed use (non motorized) trails that start at the National Cemetery and extend along the canal to North Scottsdale Road and Princess.  Beautiful Desert Wilderness is only a stones throw from our home.  Come out and enjoy!  Remember to tread lightly and pack out what you pack in.
4	My first run in Phoenix was at Reach 11 and it was great. I wasn't expecting the park to have so many different options of activities that you can do on their property. The 5k was fun and the trail was definitely unique with ups and downs throughout the run making it that much more of a challenge! We are looking forward to going back and biking or enjoying the trail now that it has cooled off enough.Overall: AGreat park, lots of parking, plenty of activities for all ages!
5	This place is freakin huge. Acres upon acres of grass fields for soccer or football or if you just want to run your dog. Always pick up after your dog tho. Plenty of times if seen owners walk away from their mess. Any ways, they have walking and bike paths, nice baseball fields and big shaded areas with restrooms. Great family place
5	Great facility. I have recently been doing some training sessions on the fields. Since I do a lot of long runs the open field full of grass is a easy way to knock out a light tempo run. Usually workout there in the am and at 4pm during the week and its peaceful nice a quite. Get in get your work done and get out.
