5	Heartwood Tree Service is by far the best in the Charlotte Metro area.  This company of Certified Arborists is stronger than ever lead by owner and fearless leader Patrick George.  Not only does each individual care about the health and maintenance of YOUR trees but they also take interest in the safety of one another on the job.  They are smart, efficient and dedicated to the art of tree care.
4	I used heartwood tree service a couple of times.  First time was in a storm when a tree fell into my pool.  Heartwood tree company was able to come out the very next day.I also had some HUGE trees cut down and Heartwood came out with a monster truck, cut the tree at the bottom and pulled the entire tree up, out and into the mulcher. It was fascinating to watch.  Quick, clean and professional!You get what you pay for with price!
1	A WORD TO THE WISE....As one of the other posts state they are expensive for sure.  Make sure to get your pricing in writing.  I was quoted a price to later find out it was twice as much. Sales person said "That's our price take it or leave it"Not to mention they are 6 weeks out to do the work.They are many tree service company's in Charlotte that WANT your business.......
