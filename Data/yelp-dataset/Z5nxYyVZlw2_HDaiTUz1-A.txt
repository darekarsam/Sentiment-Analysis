5	After having to cancel with the movers I had hired, I was in a bit of a frenzy. I found this company on CraigsList and decided to give them a call, and I'm extremely glad I did. Whomever I spoke to on the phone, presumably the manager, told me they were all booked today and tomorrow but said he'd call his crew and see if anyone would take the job. A few minutes later, he called back saying that they'd be able to help me out today.The movers arrived right on time, and were extremely cordial and professional. I quickly left to grab some cash, coffee & bottled water for them (for which they were very grateful), and when I got back they were nearly done! I had been gone roughly 15 minutes and was a bit floored by their efficiency. Now, I had a good amount of stuff to move and they managed to get it all done in the minimum 2 hour time frame. Everything was extremely secure in their truck--all tethered down or to the sides of the truck so nothing would move in transit--and after they were done offered to let me look inside the truck to make sure it was empty. I'm honestly surprised this company does not already have a Yelp page because this was the best moving experience I've ever had. They handled all my belongings with great care, got the job done extremely quickly, and were very gracious. I tipped them very well because they certainly earned and deserved it. I will absolutely be calling them again the next time I need a moving job done and recommend them to everyone.

They started their time with me in agreement and they moved very fast.  They carried many of the things down stairs a lot more than I thought they were going to do.  They finished 30 minutes ahead of what I thought they would.  I have no problem recommending them and using them again in the future.
