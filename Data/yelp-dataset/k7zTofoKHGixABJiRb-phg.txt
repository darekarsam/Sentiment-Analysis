5	Amazing food here!I drove 10hrs from Kentucky and happened to stop by for some Chinese. They have super friendly staff and very authentic Chinese food :-)) I'm glad to have stopped for dinner.I'll definitely go back on the way home!
5	If you love authentic Chinese foods, you have to try the Sizzling Hut in DeForest! This is a family owned/run restaurant and they are not only very friendly, but they know how to cook delicious Chinese foods. My husband LOVES the Sechuan Shredded Pork - very authentic! They have an amazing chickn/mixed vegs, amazing hearty chicken noodle/veg soup too. The meats are all very lean and tender and the vegetables are all fresh, and always cooked until just tender-crisp!  There are items for kids too. I am on a gluten free diet and and they accommodate me and remember that I have a special diet when I come in. Try it out - you will be very pleased!
5	Classic American-Chinese fare. We lived in the DeForest area for more than a dozen years, so Sizzling Hut is the hometown Chinese restaurant we measure all others by.  The owner is friendly and the menu offers a lot of variety.  Our favorites include standards like hot & sour soup, sesame chicken, Governor's chicken, and potstickers -- but you really can't go wrong.  Whenever we're in the Madison area, we go out of our way to have a meal here.
