1	Avoid Dr. Troung. I had a horrible experience here.
5	I was seen at this facility today by my Banner Medical Group orthopedic surgeon. He rotates in here for clinic occasionally. I had an excellent experience. Facility was very clean. Staff I interacted with at registration and during my appointment were excellent. I'm going to look into switching primary care doctors and will likely move my primary care to this facility.
5	I have been going to see Dr. Kesara for the past 6 months. He and his staff have been treating me better than any place I've ever been. The  staff are the best at what they do and are always courteous.
