5	So far so good! My central vac has been broken for a while now and I finally found Monty online and decided to give him a call. He was on time, was professional, and knew exactly what was wrong with it. He took it back to his shop and we are currently awaiting a part. He always answers his phone too, which is rare now and days. Anyways, I will update when it's finished :)
5	Monty is such a good person and is great at what he does. He cleaned out my vacuum, showed me how to work it, and was very professional. He reminds me of my Dad, who I happen to think is awesome! I will call him back for any future repairs no doubt about it!
5	I called many other alleged central vacuum service stores.  They would not bother coming to our house.  Monty came on first request without any excuses.  Monty found the leak in the attic in 10 minutes.  That was an attic that had to 120 degrees.It was great to have our central vacuum repaired after two years of calling other services that rude at times as I begged them to come to our house.  I was prepared for a $1,000 cost to replace the 20 year old unit.  Instead, Monty repaired for $70.Thanks Monty!
5	Great service. Very honest and receptive. Used for our Central Vacuum. Will definitely use again.
