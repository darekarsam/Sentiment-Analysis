5	We have used Kenny's Lawn Service for the past couple of years and have found them dependable and reasonably priced.  They have done a great job for us and have been very helpful regarding different types of questions we have for our plants and general yard management.  The owner is very pleasant and nice to deal with.  I would highly recommend Kenny's Lawn Service.
5	Kenny's Lawn Service is GREAT! I live in a patio home that has a small patio in front with very sad looking hibiscus and a postage-size lawn with brown climbing vines in back. I didn't think a lawn service would be interested in a small job like this; however, I was pleased to find I was wrong. He fit me into a short in todays's schedule, and my place is now cleaned up and I'm ready to plant. He and his crew accomplished in less than an hour what would have taken me two or more days to handle. Not only is Kenny pleasant and professional, his rates are reasonable. I high recommend Kenny's Lawn Service.
1	If I could I would give a Zero on this review.I had the same gardeners for 10 years in Scottsdale before moving to Peoria. I paid $160.00 month with my previous gardeners and with Kenny I was paying $ 260.00 a month and not getting close to what I received in Scottsdale. I had an acre lot in Scottsdale and 9,000 square feet here in Peoria.I hired Kenny due to these reviews. What a waste of time and money.As soon as I hired Kenny my Yard went to HELL. My water bill alone increased 120.00 a month. Sprinklers broken and dip lines cut by his guys and not mentioned.Not a good choice and recommend to really quiz this guy before hiring him.
5	I've used Kenny's Lawn Service the last 3 years for winter grass over seeding.  Kenny and his employees are extremely professional and perform fantastic work.  My winter grass comes in looking like a fairway.  Great value for the money.  I highly recommend Kenny's Lawn Service.
