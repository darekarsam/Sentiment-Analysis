5	Romulo is a great photographer, he did a wonderful job with our family photos. He has unique talent to capture beautiful moments and makes you feel at ease. He offers great ideas, but also lets you be creative and involved. Wouldn't hesitate to hire him again.
5	We were beyond thrilled to have you document our special day. In addition to your amazing eye for detail and capturing precious moments in such a unique artistic and incredible way, you were professional, thorough and a pleasure to work!
5	We could not have picked a better creative partner to help document our wedding day. Romulo has an absolutely incredible eye, and can highlight even the smallest moments with breathtaking authenticity. Planning a wedding is hard, but picking Ueda Photography was the easiest (and best) decision we made. Thanks so much, Romulo! Joel Meyerson & Kristen Houser
