5	I needed a suit steamed and pressed in a hurry. This place said no problem, give us 30 minutes. Did I mention it was on a saturday?!? Not only did the have it ready in 40 minutes, they didn't charge any extra fees for getting it done so quickly!
5	Excellent same day service! I had a very wrinkled all cotton pleated skirt that needed pressing and they did a fabulous job! I was worries as it was a very expensive brand new skirt and I have had bad experiences in the past but they took excellent care of it and it looked perfect! I will definitely use them for all my dry cleaning needs!
