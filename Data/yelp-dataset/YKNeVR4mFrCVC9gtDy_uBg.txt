5	Great place to bring kids to get cut and excellent service. I have been to a lot of Charlotte shops this is by far the best and the absolutely best environment.
5	This shop is the best that I personally found.  After being in Charlotte for 8 years, I believe that I have finally found a place that I can continue to come to for years down the road.  It reminds me of the hometown, good, and family friend shop that I grew up in.  At the same time, the sharpened skill of the barbers there have a unique way of staying up to date with all of the newest styles and designs.  You never have to sacrafice design for integrity... which is super rare.
5	After moving to Charlotte, my husband was super nervous about finding a new barber. He was absolutely thrilled after his first hair cut here. Mark is really thorough and pays close attention to detail, which was appreciated. If you're looking for a quality local barber, stop in there!
5	I can say with a high degree of confidence that this is the best barbershop I have had the pleasure of visiting in the Charlotte area. It was quite evident from the service I received, that the owner takes a lot of pride in his work. I was very satisfied with my haircut, which was done in the exact manner I had requested. There was none of the hasty, sloppy service that is generally a feature of the big chains. In my experience, some of the smaller, community barbershops are usually lacking in terms of being able to provide the latest in styles, but that wasn't an issue here. The owner seemed quite adept in delivering the newest cuts in vogue.I was also very impressed with owner's professional service, as well as the general ambiance of the studio itself, which was clean and smelled nice. For those gentlemen who are new to the area like me, and don't want to become a hair casualty of the big chains, I highly recommend paying this guy a visit. I rate it a 5/5.
