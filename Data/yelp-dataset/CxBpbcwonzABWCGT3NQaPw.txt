4	Really nice food, from the bits of smoresbord and salad and scone we tried. The latte I had didn't particularly do it for me, kinda weak, didn't finish it. But I love the vibe here - big wood tables, warm lighting, open spaces, lots of folks on laptops and no feeling of rush. I'd come back for a beer and snack with a computer for some soothing and well-fuelled clickety clack.
5	After visiting the marche, we stumbled upon this place looking for breakfast/brunch. We ordered randomly from the menu the Norwegian croissant and casserole and were completely surprised. The eggs were perfectly herbed and seasoned, the fruits were brightly fresh, the toast and croissants were buttery, and the salmon was flavorful. Along with the artful presentation and fantastic service, this little cafe was a hidden gem.
