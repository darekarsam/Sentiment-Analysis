4	It has been a long time since I have been to a laundromat. For my first visit back , I was pleasantly surprised! Hi-tech is pretty high-tech! Long gone are the days of quarters and slots. Now you buy a card and load it will money and insert the card into the machine. The employee was very helpful and I'm sure she could tell I was struggling trying to figure out the new system. We didn't have to buy a card, rather, we used her card and then paid her directly.There are numerous machines! Another new advancement that I learned on this visit was that there are different machines that vary on how big your load is (e.g., 18 lb., 27lb., 35lb., 50lb.).The laundromat is spacious and clean! There are a couple of arcade games to keep you occupied and a tv playing CNN. The chairs, however, are not comfortable. I guess not everything has advanced.All in all it was a good experience!
4	Certainly hi-tech for a laundromat. Very clean, lots of washers in every size and a very helpful staff. Would happily return if needed. Minus 1 star because none of the dryers were consistent with their heat settings.
4	I'm not an expert on laundromat, actually I barely go to one. This one seems pretty decent, the area is clean, a lot of different size washer, and friendly staff. It's located right by the street, so not creepy at all.The only thing is that u have to purchase card to use the machine. However, the guy works here knows his regulars lol... So he offer to use the store card and pay him cash, if we don't want to buy a card
