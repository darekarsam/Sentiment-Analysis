4	I was a in a bit of a hurry and swung by this branch thinking it would be a quick in and out... Well, the line was to the door and there was only one teller.  #3 was on her name tag.  Despite the line, she was very efficient and very nice.  Even knew the couple in front of me on a first name basis.. I didn't know the PO has "regulars"  I definitely recommend it for the PM area.  Great in and out with a smile and easy parking lot to make it all the better.  Happy Mailing!! :)
4	This is definitely now MY post office. If I'm in need of sending a package, letter, telegram (do they do that?), or picking up something that was oddly sent to this location, I'll be as happy as a clam. The parking is easy as there is a lot and a few spaces on the street.Most folks are coming in to check their mailboxes or to send a quick letter/package. The service was super friendly and I even had more than a "transactional" conversation with the rep at the counter. She even said she liked my shirt! How nice is that?!Yay USPS!
4	This Post Office can get very busy... especially around lunch time and after 4pm.  Best time is in the early morning.Friendly staff and they never rush you if you have a weighed package going out.I use the free priority boxes for shipping and I get my labels online (discounted price), but they only carry the Flat Rate Boxes and Envelopes for regular and express priority at this location.  Also no automated machine to buy stamps, weight your package, etc...
