4	Ordered 10 pieces of Dim Sum to go. Was sadly disappointed by their limp unappetizing look. I expected proper Dim Sum but got steamed dumplings. Watch out. Priced too high (10 pieces here is more expensive than 15 pieces at Mai Xiang Yuan, which are awesome!) but they taste excellent. Can't decide between 3 and 4 stars, so I am rounding up.. but I would say 3.5 ;)
5	I love going to Zyng. Customizing your noodle dish is the best! You pick your noodles, sauce, veggies and protein.Depending on how picky my restaurant buddy is, I'll either take the chef's selection or load up my bowl at the fresh veggie bar and hand it to the chef as he prepares my dish.I always take Zoya though (realy convincing tofu chicken). I'm not vegetarian but I like to think it's me keeping fat levels as low as possible.The service is great because, for some odd reason, the place is always empty and the waitress is just sitting in the back waiting on you.The decor is right up my alley: a fresh, vibrant Asian theme.Tip: Check the Entertainment book for a 2 for 1 couponConclusion:I have no complaints about Zyng. Good food, good service, good atmosphere. I couldn't ask for anything more.
