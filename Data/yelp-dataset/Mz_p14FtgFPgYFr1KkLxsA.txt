5	I found this restaurant from trip advisor. It turned out to be a great experience! One of the best sushi fine dining experience in Montreal. Definitely worth checking out.
4	I go there for lunch many times.  Small place with very very friendly service.  I always have the 12-piece sushi special, comes with a very tasty miso soup and a salad with a nice sesame dressing.  The sushi is tasty, at par with other sushi places in the West Island without the frills.
4	A little gem hidden within an unassuming strip mall. Tiny but warm room.  Friendly but not unctuous service. Fresh fish solidly prepared. I really enjoyed it. Bonus: ask to hear Dustin Dao's cd. DD works at Soho. He's very talented and we enjoyed the cd so much at Soho,we bought it! (I'm in no way affiliated with the musician, just loved what we heard in the restaurant.).
4	Looking for outside it doesn't seem convincing to eat inside although as they say "You can never tell a book by its cover" or "Don't judge a book by its cover". After going inside and eating a great 100$ sushi supper and sake w 3 people it was well worth it. I strongly recommend it for people trying it out :) It might not be THE BEST although it's very very close to there :)
