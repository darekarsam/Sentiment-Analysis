4	While this Dillard's location won't replace the Fashion Show as my "go to" spot, I do enjoy the higher end finishes they used in this store, its newness, and their well stocked shelves.  It is just too far from Henderson to frequent regularly.  And while some departments seemed to have a larger selection than the FS or Galleria stores (like purses, cosmetics, men's shoes); I felt that the women's shoe department was lacking and smaller that the aforementioned locations and so was the home department.  All in all I think it's a great addition for those who like Dillard's and live in Summerlin / Summerlin adjacent.
5	Great store....love the set up and the new operating. Floor plan. Great customer service and friendly staff.
1	Went in last night to put a shirt in order.  Special order.  They told me they would take 40 dollars to hold special made shirt.  They took the whole amount.  Went back.  They told me they would void order and money returned to my card.  No luck.  They held funds for total purchase.  Do not trust them with your credit card info on special orders.  They will use it at their liberty.  Bad experience.
5	SUMMERLIN'S NEW DEPARTMENT  STOREI was awed  by the size and inventoy of this beautful new department. store. (Macys doesn't hold a candle in comparsion.)  Dillards spared no expenses to bring the best to Summerlin..  Their store in Metairie, Louisiana is equallly beautiful and larger in scale.. It's still my favorite.  Hopefully corporate will see fit to revamp and upgrade their Hnderson location .
