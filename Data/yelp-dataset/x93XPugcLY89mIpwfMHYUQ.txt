1	So every other Jiffy Smog charges $19.99 for a smog check except this one.  $26.99.  They only do this because this is their busiest stop. Lots of other locations to choose from!
3	A little expensive but I was in a bit of a hurry so settled for something convenient over price. Service was ok, albeit somewhat awkward. There are cheaper ones I he area but the one I checked before was closed when I needed them, so this place was not only convenient but available. Good enough in a pinch.
1	Should have read reviews before making the mistake of coming here. Rip off!!! Do not come here. With a competitor coupon, they still charge $18 at the lowest. Then when you go to pay, they slap on another $6 to put it into the DMV system without telling you. Why would anyone get a smog test besides to register their car?!? So the lowest you will pay is $24!!! Then if you're too lazy to find a DMV kiosk (there's one right inside the Albertsons at Trop & Jones), you can pay  $10 more for them to register it for you.
