1	Order took over an hour to get delivered, and pizza was burnt. If u want a good pizza, don't order delivery from this place! !!!!
1	This is about bad customer service ... On a number of occasions now, I have called to order some food and the phone rings and rings.  I pick up my food because of the distance I live from Domino's and today, since they didn't answer the phone, I stopped in to place my order.  No one was there... there were no customers and the only cars were those of the drivers ... So, I asked why they didn't pick-up the phone .. the response was  - we're been really busy, really?.  I ordered, left to run an errand, and when I returned 10 minutes later, guess what ... still no customers, and no one working anywhere within eye sight ... nothing ...Perhaps, being in a small town, they think it's okay to not answer the phone ...  Well, they've just lost my business and if 500 other people feel the same way, maybe they'll get the point... probably not...
5	I order from this Domino's regularly.  They have very good pizza and fast delivery.  My fav!!
