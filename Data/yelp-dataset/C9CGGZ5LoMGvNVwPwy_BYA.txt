5	Best sushi ever and always fresh and well madeLots too choose from and they always come up with new things to add to their menuLove the fact that they have different size platter for parties or gatheringsIf you want anything off the menu best thing is to call ahead of time and like that its ready when you get there and you don't wait.Nothing bad to say about this location but would be awesome if they delivered.They take cash, credit card and debit as well
