1	I beg you please....please...please don't go here. Unless you enjoy meat that's been cooked to death and you consider grease a condiment.  I use to work down the street from this location and literally swerved across three lanes when I saw that one magical word that gives me a raging hunger hard on every time I see it...TAQUERIA.  I walked in and ordered three tacos. 1 Asada, 1 Pastor, and 1 Lengua.  All were terrible. The lengua had an indescribable funk to it. The asada was good, well that is if you like chewing on a leathery horse dong that's been baking in the senora sun. The pastor sucked and everything was soaking in greasy diarrhea sauce. So if your jonesen for a leathery horse dong soaked in diarrhea sauce you'll love this place, if not you will be severely disappointed. THIS PLACE SUCKS.
5	Good tacos, no horse dong to be found.
2	The other guy's review is a little overly dramatic. This place isn't great, but it's solidly mediocre vs straight up bad. Carne asada is shredded beef not steak. Their al pastor was kind of bland.We only stopped here because I got furniture from heritage distribution and its in the same building. Would I go back? No, but at least it was clean and fast.
3	Addressing negative older posts...i am pretty sure that this place is under new management or owners. Solid if not great. Very clean and really good breakfast burritos. Looking forward to lunch the salsa bar is pretty authentic.
1	No just no. The food was way below PAR I ordered the chicken enchiladas thinking it should be a delightful one..It was a big fat NO! Chicken was not cooked and the sauce was so bland I wanted to slap myself for coming to this place. A big let down to cheap and easy mexican food..
4	Very good Mexican breakfast!!!  Juevos a la mexicana, ranchero, con chorizo, and con Jamon.  Primarily a place for local workers to get lunch or breakfast.
