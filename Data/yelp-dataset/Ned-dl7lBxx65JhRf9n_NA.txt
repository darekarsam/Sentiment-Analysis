5	Hands down the best wings on the island.Tuesday night 2 for 1 wings are a must.I love going with the guys, picking from their large selection of beers and having the meatiest, juciest and best sauced wings around.Staff is very friendly and helpful.Sometimes it gets a bit crowded due to its small size, but it's worth the wait every time!
5	People often ask me how a restaurant gets a five star review. For me it's simple, when a place offers something amazing. In this case, it's the wings. They are the best you'll ever have. Order them without any sauce, ask for the sauce on the side. Prepare your taste buds for chicken wing utopia! It will set a new baseline of greatness.   Mmmmm
4	Cunninghams is one of those jewels that inhabit the small towns like Sainte-Anne-De-Bellevue that people lunge for.Cunninghams is a small pub offering pretty good food (BEST WINGS I've ever had in my life), the most satisfying deserts I've ever had, a decent selection of beer, decent atmosphere and above average space management. Even when crowded, the tables were arranged in such way that moving around was still possible without tucking in the stomach too much.I've never tasted something so good as the fried cheese cake. Dear holy mighty god of diabetes was it amazing.On the downside, with quality came the price and it's not outrageously expensive but it does take a toll on a student's wallet! So be careful!Also in all my visits, I've only seen that blonde older waitress smile and be friendly once... :S!
