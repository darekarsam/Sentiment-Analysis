5	I moved out here from San Diego 18 months ago and searched for a nail salon that I liked. There are probably a dozen salons within a mile of my house and they were not up to par. Then, thankfully Haleys opened a few months ago and I haven't gone anywhere else. They are the best around! Great atmosphere,  helpful, friendly and my nails ALWAYS look great! This full service salon takes care of my waxing needs too! Give Haleys a try, you'll be glad you did!
4	Staff is very friendly, salon is clean. Great color selection. Have been here twice now and the second experience was a little better than the first. Don't be afraid to ask for what you want. It is your nails and you should leave with them how you want. I asked for a few changes on my nails and she did them. All in all great service, prices, and location in the easy valley . I will be back
4	My appointment was at 2 30 pm & even though I was 6 minutes late,  they were all ready for me. I move to Mesa from San Diego in March and was going all the way to Gilbert, but this is my new place for sure!Their greeter was really nice and offered me and my daughter something to drink right away, the place is large. There are 5 pedicure chairs and & 3 tables. A lot of colors to choose from on the polish wall. The lady doing my pedicure knows her stuff she didn't pressure me for any add ons, and she worked long and hard on my feet. I love that it was not a rushed pedicure.PRO'S: accommodating serviceCleanCourteous staffRelaxingCON'S:chemical smell No Wi-Fi................    bring cash to tip. (Not really a con though)
