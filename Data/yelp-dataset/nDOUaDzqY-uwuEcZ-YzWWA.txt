3	If Bistro on the Avenue were to launch today in any other location, it would not survive, due to its price point and lack of creativity.  However, it is a favorite among Westmount locals, and is a viable option if you live nearby and don't feel like cooking.  In other words, we would not go out of our way with the intent of coming here, but we also wouldn't mind revisiting this long-standing establishment every now and then.
3	One of our favorite neighbourhood  bistros. We have been coming here for over a decade. As a matter of fact we came for dinner the night we decided to get married and wrote the guest list on one of their napkins. Service and atmosphere are friendly. Prices are high but the food is good.
2	We ordered a NY steak and an omelette. The steak was too well done, and as tasteless as the omelette. Very weak food and not worth the price. Good music and good ambiance, so it may be good for drinks.
5	I don't know what this place has become but my review will apply to what it once was.When the Bistro first opened, they had some of the best food, drinks and ambience in Montreal. From their Goat Cheese Filo to their Chicken baguette served with this marmalade chili dressing to their perfectly cooked Steak/frites - it was one of my favorite restaurants in the city.If I ever return, I would love to go again although it seems like they don't stick to that old menu anymore. Perhaps since their reviews are so terrible, they might want to go back to their roots and figure out what they did well back then. Also music, lighting and beautiful server Lydia lol...I can still recall all of it...
