4	During the winter, Tenney Park has the best ice skating in the city. Huge pond and generally well kept ice. Skate rental is $6 for an hour. Very cool.During the summer, it's a bit run-down and outdated. A cool running path and some basketball/soccer courts are in the middle of a moat-like pond. However, thanks to the pond, there are lots of mosquitoes.The beach, pier, and locks are awesome to check out. Lots of fisherman, but generally quiet and a neat view of the city.
4	I came here to put in my kayak on Lake Mendota and do some fishing so, I didn't actually get to spend much time in the park, per se.  However, from what I have seen, and driving by the skating rinks in winter, Tenney Park is quite a nice park, located so close to downtown Madison....if only we could do something about the water quality in the lakes  :(
4	When I first moved to Madison, I was half a block from Tenney Park - so maybe I'm a little sentimental in my love. Still this is one of my favorite Madison places to plan a run around mostly because it's peaceful and there's always plenty to look at along the river. Tenney's wealth of bridges means I can stretch a run out a minute or two by taking a bit of a zig-zag route without repeating the same path every day. It connects to the Sherman/North Sherman neighborhood on one side of the park and the Atwood/Winnebago area on the other side, so it lines up with favorite biking and running routes.In the winter, this is my preferred place to ice skate. In fact, this is where I learned to skate last year! Rentals are available and the indoor space is roomy, with plenty of seating. Other than that, nothing fancy. If you're brave and half crazy like me you can ride your bike right up to the shelter to park and skate. There is plenty of ice, so you shouldn't feel too claustrophobic even when there are many kids out.
