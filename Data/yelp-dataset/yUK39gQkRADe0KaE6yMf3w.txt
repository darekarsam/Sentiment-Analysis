5	Love Efficient Movement!  Completely trust Marilyn and Courtney with my daughters injury rehabilitation and athletic training. My only regret is that we didn't start coming years ago.
5	In life you cross paths with individuals who you know have gone above and beyond in their specialty to provide the best all around care for their clients, Marilyn is one of those individuals. She understands the anatomy of the body, its biomechanical dysfunction, and uses evidence based guidelines as part of her therapy/sports performance to enhance movement and strength. I highly recommend Marilyn and her staff.
5	If you want to stay active, at any age, you need these muscle and movement experts. I had knee pain, back pain and visited medical specialists, each of whom had a different explanation and recommendation. Luckily for me, Courtney and Marilyn were at my little gym treating their clients. After watching them performing deep tissue massage and specific muscle work, I asked for an evaluation...A whole new world opened up for me...beyond exercise training, beyond PT, an expertise that falls somewhere in between. What they do is tend to your muscles, and mine were either weak, overtaxed and/or unable to fire. Some of my muscles had to overcompensate for others. These weaknesses caused back pain, muscle fatigue, knee pain and general inability to be as active as I had been. Efficient Movement's  focus is on getting all your muscles to perform, to fire, and to get strong. The result for me, after about 3-4 weeks is no more back pain or knee pain, greater strength and stability, and most importantly, the ability to do exercise, fly fishing (my hobby), walking, or whatever else I want to do. My body feels about 10 years younger...all my parts are working again.Thank you Courtney and Marilyn.
