4	Fast, friendly service. Helpful staff. Try the Farmer's Blend!
5	Ok, the hours are bad.  But everything else is great.  The baristas are friendly (and attractive).  The coffee is the best I've had since Cuba - this includes other Balzacs locations.  Always a cool techie Tannery crowd, and usually dece music.  Plus its got decor like a Parisian coffee shop.  Like all their locations, Balzacs at the Tannery shines.
5	Amazing coffee and excellent service! Jessica the barista does amazing coffee art!
5	Been here many times. Excellent coffee, and great place to chill or do work. Service has always been good in my experience.
2	I don't drink coffee, so can't comment on that. But the tea is expensive, and the scones are really dry and terrible. The scones used to be delicious, so I'm not sure what happened. But I don't like paying 2.50 for a dry scone that falls apart as you are trying to lift it to your mouth to eat it. Even adding butter or heating it up doesn't help. Bring back the old scones!
