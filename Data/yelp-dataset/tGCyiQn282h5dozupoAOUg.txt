5	I love the YMCA at Ballantyne Village!  It's adults only and it's always clean and neat.  It's an express Y so the equipment can be a little limited compared to other full service Y's but the Morrison Y is right down the street if you need it.  It has pretty much everything you need, just less of it.  I also like the adults only policy.
5	Great place for a quick workout. Easy parking. It's an express Y, so it has a smaller footprint (all the better timewise). Has everything I need - ellipticals, treadmills, bikes, weight machines, free weights and stretching area. For distraction - there is tv on the ellipticals and they have good magazines. There is a studio upstairs where they hold classes. No kids - the Morrison (5 mins away) has childcare, is much larger and has a ton of classes. Alas, it takes significantly longer time to park, get where you are going, etc. Just doesn't work on a lunch break...
4	This YMCA is a great spot for getting in, working out, and getting out without a big hassle.  I like the size of the gym and the selection of machines, weights, etc. The staff is very nice and helpful if you need assistance.
