5	They came to my rescue and are genuine people
1	Dreadful experience with installation of four faucets!  Initial work was unacceptable -- faucets weren't lined up over the holes in the granite, so there was an opening next to the base and drains leaked.  Plumber returned once but didn't fix the problems and, due to his attitude over the phone when we informed him of the continuing issues, I decided to redo the installation myself following manufacturer instructions.  In doing so, I noted several failures to comply with installation instructions.  Problems now solved.
5	Bob and his crew are great!  I have used them for years, always reliable, quick to respond and honest.
