5	Came here because I was in town for a wedding. Called and made an appointment so I didn't have to wait. Got a great fade and line up while talking the usual barbershop BS. Real kick back joint.
5	Come here every other week and see Luis for a fade and shave. His skills are mean...even takes calls for appointments. Laid back environment. All the guys are good.
5	I took my son here years ago and he got a cut from Stunna... his fade was tight. Just relocated back here went today and this time my youngest son got a cut from Carl still was done nicely to me you can't go wrong sitting in either Stunna's chair, Carl or Antonio these brother's got skills definitely will be going back bi-weekly. I live all the way out in Henderson but these guys are worth the drive
