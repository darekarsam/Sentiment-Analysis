4	We stop in this QT every time we pass by, which varies from a few times a month to months in between.  It's on our way to play baseball some 60 miles from home.  The people here are friendlier than average, even moreso than most QTs.
5	This QT is best in my book!  Well ran, very friendly and extremely efficient staff.  I can truly appreciate the way that this store is ran.  Well done!
4	I only wish they sold 8-10lb bags of their crushed ice. Convenient spot for lottery tickets.
5	People here are way more intelligent then circle k damn.
4	Big ol' bank of gas pumps, gleaming in the lights surrounded by desert air. This is about your last stop for gasoline if you're headed to the 60 and don't want to be bothered to fill up until you're out of town.If you're headed off of the 60, there are closer gas stations to the Mesa Gateway airport (think: rental car gas tank top-offs) but this one is as good as any of them.I never went in the building, but when you've got that many pumps and you're in and out of there in under 5 minutes, why bother? Unless you're after the junk food. And then, presumably, you've got your QT full of junk just a few steps away from the gasoline.
