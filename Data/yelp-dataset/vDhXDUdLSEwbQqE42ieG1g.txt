4	If i could take everything from Stuff and put it into my house, I'd be a very happy girl!  This is EXACTLY my kind of store.  Modern, not too harsh, but with a fun and funky twist.  Of course I wanted everything in there!As Amy C states, it is incredibly small, but great to know they get in new merch so often.  There was a particular love seat, which turned into a single sleeper, that I fell in love with!  It was adorable, tan base with brown and blue polka dots.  We were so destined to be together, I'm sure of it!  The sales woman there was even nice enough to offer a deep discount.  My darn conscious got in the way, being so close to xmas.  I'm hoping it will be there after, so I can visit with it again, and potentially make it mine!Don't get me wrong, the prices are high, but not ridiculous.  It's pretty much what you'd expect from a contemporary furniture boutique.  Once we buy a house, this is going to be one of my first destinations for decorating!
