5	It just snowed in Charlotte and if that means anything to you, it should. Lots of salt and grit and crap on the road making cars look NASTY. So I was pleased to spot this practically brand new Wiki Wiki along North Tryon. They usually do a $3 basic wash, but the cheapest today was the $5 which includes a wash and blow dry with all the vacuuming that you can suck.Great service and my car is now CLEAN.The layout of the place is a little on the weird side. You have to drive around it to get in and then drive around again to get out. I don't know why it's this way, it just is.

It is NOT a full service wash such as Autobell.This is the company's second location and it is shoe-horned into a too-small lot in a very high traffic area near the Super Walmart on North Tryon. Four levels of service are offered, priced $5-$20 in $5 increments. IMO the basic wash at $5 is a good value, while the $20 premium wash is overpriced since it does not include interior service. There are plenty of individual self-service vacuum stalls but on a busy day be prepared for short waits to get one. Once you drive into a space you can access a dedicated hose with an attached sturdy nozzle. The powerful vacuum can probably suck a wet towel dry, so be prepared for a bit of a learning curve. Mine kept clamping to the carpet like a leech until I mastered my own hovering technique. Signs ask you to stay no more than 10 minutes but I didn't notice any tickets being issued for violations.  ;-)
