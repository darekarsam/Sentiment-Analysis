4	Love the girls clothes at this store.  If you go at the end of the season you can sometimes still find good deals for the following season.  Usually how I buy my daughters clothes.  Love them but dont' always want to pay the sticker price.Staff has always been helpful and polite.  Will return :)
4	I have shopped at this store since it opened. I have spent enough money to  merit a gold watch!! the staff is always helpful and smiles, they stay late cleaning so you can finish shopping, i love it. but there has been this one younger red headed girl lately that is THE WORST EMPLOYEE ever!! She is the ONLY reason for a star drop. Drop her before you lose customers for life!
4	The staff was great! So helpful in explaining discounts and helping me find certain items. They even checked to see when certain products were coming in for me. Unfortunately, they did not have stockings in which I would think would be on shelves by now since the colder weather hit.
