4	Laing Boutique is the quirkier, more costume jewellery edged little sister to the bigger, more expensive Laing the Jeweller a few doors up. The boutique may be wee, but it's full of glass cabinets of jewellery joy, with many trendsome brand names, such as Juicy Couture, Lulu Guinness, Mont Blanc and Cruz. The jewels in here definitely have a fun edge to them, and are certainly fashionable, so this is a good option for browsing when you want something that's less high street trinket, and more quality fashion jewellery that you can wear over and over without worrying about it falling to pieces.There are still more expensive, special occasion items to be found here, like the Gucci watches, and as watches go, I'm quite a fan of the Juicy Couture cream numbers that Laing also stock. They've recently brought in a range of Mancini rings, which are excellent, because you just buy whichever band you want from the range, and they're all really reasonably priced, then you can keep coming back and buying different colours of stones to team with the band, as they're detachable. Great for fickle minded people like me, who get bored of the same colour after a few days.
