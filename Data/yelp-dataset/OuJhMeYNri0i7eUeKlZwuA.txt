5	I have lived in countless places and thus have experienced every type of auto repair shop there is. Wilhelm is hands down the best one out there! Their staff is honest with you, whatever your car needs may be, they will be looking out for YOUR best interests, not their wallets. And I can not say enough about the amazing quality of their work! If you're looking for a auto repair shop look no further.
5	After numerous fiascos at the dealership across the street, I took my little car here for some TLC. They found the root cause of the issue (which I still contend was initially  caused by the dealership), fixed it quickly and at a reasonable price. Had another (different) issue a couple months later - same story: quick and efficient. Highly recommend Wilhelm's. Will continue to take my car here. They even gave me a ride to/from work.
5	We were looking for a place in the area to perform a buyer's inspection on a vehicle we were considering buying. Mike and Gina got us in right away and performed a thorough check of the vehicle in a timely way. We felt confident we made a good decision on the purchase and will keep Wilhelm as our mechanic of choice. I didn't mention the inspection was complimentary - thanks so much Mike and Gina.Dan
5	Mike and his associates at Wilhelm's Scottsdale shop have always provided reliable, fast, and, most importantly, honest service. As my auto approaches 100K miles, I know I can depend on them for dependable advice and repairs.
