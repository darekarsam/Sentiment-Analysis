1	It has a good car wash, but the place STINKS! (Literally)
3	For a gas station, they're decent... The workers are okay, but they really need to replace the paper in the printers outside... Don't even offer me a receipt if I have to go inside and get it... I know, I know... Classic first world problem...  (But seriously, stop playing with my emotions and fill up the paper.)
3	This 7-11 is pretty much like all the rest. It's well stocked and clean.Slurpees, chips, gum, lotto whatever you are looking for they have it. It's attached to a shopping center with a Bilo, Walmart and Lowes so that makes it a little more convenient if you are looking or a one stop shop.
