4	this place is great: large portions and reasonable prices. check it out (and be sure order perogies).
3	Great if you crave delicious schnitzel and perogies in a quaint setting - a house in Kitchener converted to a restaurant many years ago.  No fuss just tasty food and big enough portions at decent prices.  If you're a yuppie and value pampering and decor then go elsewhere.  Just cash or debit - awesome fair for real people.  My 18 year old daughter and 81 year old Mom (on her birthday) both gave it a thumbs up!
4	Simple, homey and well done comfort food. Terrific goulash!
5	I went with my girlfriends family and it was flawless!  I, being from Holland, and them being from Austria, this was just like Oma's home cooking.  It is as genuine and authentic as it gets.  Everything is made fresh and in house.  The chef is a little germany lady that does it all on her own.  its very quaint seats a dozen people tops. but it was quiet and comfortable.  The perogies and sauerkraut are the best I have ever had!  the strudel is TRUE strudel.  non of this North American strudel thats like apple pie, this was perfect.   I will be going back again next week.  I love this place.  Highly recommend.
5	Small capacity, but great service and really great schnitzel, mash, and roast sausage. Quaint interiors also add to the fun. Would definitely return. Expect to spend $20-30 for a meal and a beer.
