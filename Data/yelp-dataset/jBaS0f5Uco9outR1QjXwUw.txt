5	It's always tough to choose an Air Conditioning company and it usually happens only when it's 100 degrees and it's not working and you're scrambling to find one that can come out asap. This company took care of my system fast and with very professional service. If you're in the Phoenix area and need A/C service, I highly recommend.
5	I had to have my entire system replaced when I bought my house and spent more than $30,000 with Daisy Mountain. The assessment of the problem was accurate, their solution appropriate, and the price fair. My monthly electric bills were reduced by almost $200 and the house is now cool. Subsequently the new system needed adjustment and they were out immediately. They are thorough, clean (always wear booties), and trustworthy (I left the technician in the house alone when I had to leave for an appointment). I cannot recommend them more highly.
1	They pulled the Ole switch-a-roo on the hubby and I.  Good one.  I called and was happily scheduled for a tune up at $64.95 a piece, sounds good.  Just needed to get the regular tune- up since we recently bought the house. No problems, no issues...Well, I get home and the guy told my husband we paid a diagnostic fee, that he didn't do a tune up, because that would be an extra cost. He then tried to sell us package (including tune ups of course) with a price ($436) that was good "only if we purchased immediately".  It was 6pm and the office was closed, so why wouldn't the price be good the next day?  SCAM.So, end of story, we just paid 136.00 and they did not do anything they said they would. The guy was perfectly nice (well,except for not doing the tune up and trying to get us to spend a ton of money when our AC is perfectly fine), and the dog didn't growl at him, so that was a plus. She growls at the bad ones ,usually.It's too bad because I really, really wanted to like them.
