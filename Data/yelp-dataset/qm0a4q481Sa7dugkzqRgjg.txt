5	First note this is a take out or delivery pizza place only, NOT dine in. I was staying at a local resort and ordered from here. The pizza was a true thin crust and ours was simply delicious. The guy behind the counter said he likes to dip the pizza in the marinara sauce as I ordered the white pizza. He tossed the sauce in for free and gave me a $5 off coupon. This is a clean, quick, and friendly place. Will update if we order again while on our vacation.
2	So ordered at 7pm. Pizza still not here and it's 8:50.  delivery time 8:05-8:15. Right :/ maybe I'll get it before the 2 hour marker.  Never have had it take this long usually here faster than given time. Not happy
1	Stay clear of this place - mixed up orders - unprofessional - bad customer service.  Don't bother calling in an order because when you arrive it will not be ready.  Even when the staff admits the error nothing is done to better the situation - discount or attempt to get you to return as a customer.  Stay clear - you have been warned
2	People love this place.  I am just not a fan of their pizza.  Then again, I am an ex-New Yorker!
5	One of the best pizza i had on the west coastThey have a great deal buy 18inch pizza and a 12 inch free and then collect 12 coupons for 50% off any pizza
