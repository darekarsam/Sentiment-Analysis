5	I had no problems renting a last-minute truck for an emergency move. The people behind the counter were informative, and renting the truck was quick, easy and affordable. I got a furniture dolly for an extra $7.00  The office was small and clean. There's a little section on a wall where they sell a small number of move-related items like tape and bungee cords.  The van I got was clean- no complaints.Dropping off the truck was simple as well, as they have a nighttime slot to drop the key into.  They are sticklers for refilling the gas tank and I was duly warned that I'd be charged over $30 if I neglected to bring the tank back up to the halfway mark.  I'll definitely be back.
4	I recently rented a moving van so that I could relocate some things from my garage to a storage unit. We booked our truck through the website a couple days in advance. When I got there, the truck was ready, the service was fast, and the ladies at the counter were friendly. This is definitely where I will be going the next time I need a truck.
5	I hate to say it, but I do have quite a bit of experience moving and renting trucks. These guys are great to work with. I've used them a couple of times and returned specifically because of the experience. Always super-friendly over the phone and a pleasure to work with. Even last minute. The location is spot on, super convenient. Definitely recommend!!
