3	3.5 stars.  Zhen Choo is a typical suburban shopping center Chinese restaurant.  There's no real surprises here--you'll know exactly what you're going to get when you come in here.  And I mean that in a very good way.  Places like these serve good, solid Americanized Chinese food.  Translation:  what they do, they do well.I stopped in here recently after doing a home visit for work.  Zhen Choo has the typical Monday-Friday lunch menu, with pretty much everything in the $5.00 per item range.  My General Tso's Chicken and my hot & sour soup was as good as any I've had.  Zhen Choo may not wow you, but it's got good food that'll give you good bang for your buck.
4	I find myself missing the Kung Pao Chicken, Mu Shu Pork, Lo Mein, and friendly service that this place offers. After living in Southern California for many years,and travelling to Hunan Province, I have tasted some of the best. This place is consistently good,and inexpensive.  Too bad it is so far from home now!  I don't get to visit Zhen Choo very often, and I miss it.
4	Good basic Chinese American, made fresh, and no MSG,  there are specialties and done better than others, always a friendly face kind thought and word, dumplings steamed are very good ...
4	Zhen Choo is simple but delicious. If you can, try them for lunch - they have $5 specials. No MSG, and fast, friendly service.
