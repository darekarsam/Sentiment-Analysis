5	I'm Latina and recently moved to Charlotte. Tacos El Nevado has really good tacos.  The place isn't at all fancy and you'll only see a few people in there, but the tacos are delicious.  Try their horchata too!    La comida esta sabrosa!
5	Finally! My boyfriend and I have been looking for authentic Mexican  (Honduran) food in the Charlotte area since we moved here 7 months ago. It is a hole-in-the-wall kind of place with a small but very friendly staff. The flavors are spot on. Their tomatillo salsa is perfect, the chorizo tacos were amazing. I was starting to think there weren't any authentic places in the area, so thank you, Tacos El Nevado!!
5	Cheap, great tacos.  Love this spot.
5	Looks rough but be bold and experience a little bit of Mexican heaven right off of Woodlawn.  Had tounge, tripe, and steak tacos. Best in the city.
