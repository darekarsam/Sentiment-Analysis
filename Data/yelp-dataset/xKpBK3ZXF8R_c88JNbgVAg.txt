3	Everything really is a dollar (though some things are two for a dollar). I thought I might take a browse and see what there was and I was amazed. I somehow managed to pick up $7 worth of stuff that I actually needed for my place. Stuff that would have been twice or three times the price at the local Wal-Mart.If you're looking to save a few bucks, Dollar Tree rocks!
3	This is a very busy dollar store. No matter what time I go in there is always a line at the cashiers station. This location has a good variety of merchandise, but the shelves (because they are so busy) are never fully stocked. The employees definitely make this place 3.5 stars. I think they are always friendly, even with a line wrapped around to the door. They try their best even without a lot of extra help, and that's pretty much all you can ask for from your cashier.
4	How can you complain when it's all a DOLLAR ? I love this place !!! A dollar a hollar ! Yeah !
