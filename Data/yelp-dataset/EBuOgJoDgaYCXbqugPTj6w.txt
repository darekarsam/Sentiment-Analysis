5	I was directed to this business by another Yelper - Emily H.My baby just got back from her spa day (shampoo, cut, blow dry and nails).I love how she looks (in spite of the pink bandana) and how she smells.  And I was very impressed with the staff.  Lori did a great job grooming.  Jill was very attentive, pointing out a small cut on the dog's side - likely caused by the other dog in our house but hidden by all of the fur - when she called to tell me the dog was finished.  It's really obvious that everyone there loves and cares very much for dogs.There's a First Time Customer discount and a Frequent Customer program (no charge to join) and discounts when services are bundled.  So make sure to ask to maximize your value and visit.BTW, the webcam rocks!  I didn't get a thing done this morning because I kept watching the webcam but it sure provided some peace of mind that my baby was being well cared for.Emily H - thanks again for the recommendation!
5	Let me start off this review by saying this - I love my dog, but he is a difficult little guy. He has horrible separation anxiety and he loathes other dogs....we adopted him and we handle it the best we can.Knowing this, the staff at Best Friends are awesome! They really take care of my pup and we really appreciate his "report card" when we pick him up. If we're gone on a long trip they don't mind us calling and checking on him. AND, as of the past few visits they now e-mail me a photo of my dog during his stay...it's adorable. My only teeny gripe is that the a la carte services can add up quick...I wish they included a walk with their daily $28 boarding rate. I highly recommend Best Friends to all parents of fur babies!
4	My dog hates animals, but loves this place. He's at home in his private junior suite, and has all his girlfriends around him, albeit they're human (Best Friends staff). My beagle always has a great time and his report card always says he was "excited" and "talkative". Thanks for being nice Best Friends staff (ha). Only thing is that's it's a little pricey ($29/night) and then you had packages or extras and it's abut $35-$40/day. For a week vacation or a weekend getaway for me and the wife, it can get expensive. That said; the little Satan likes it there, so at least he's happy while we're out of town.
5	I was a bit skeptical about boarding my dog since I take him wherever I go but I heard rave reviews this place. That being said, I was a tad nervous when taking my dog there last summer. The staff was extremely friendly and understanding about my apprehension about leaving my dog and I thank them for that. When I was away, they emailed me a picture of my dog so I could see he was doing well (plus you can go online and see them on their webcam during play time) They also offer additional packages with more play time, ice cream doggie treats, bed time stories (don't laugh, thats just cute) and more. My dog was so happy when I went to pick up, I think he was even smiling! I think their prices are pretty reasonable for overnight stay compared to some other joints in the area and have taken him there a few times since.   Best Friends also offers your pets first night free which is pretty sweet seeing that I have nothing against saving $$$$ here and there and they provide you with a report card when you pick them up--again--cute!! Even though I dont like near there anymore, I would definitely go there again and can't recommend them enough.
2	I recently went out of town for 4 days and decided to try Best Friends Pet Care.  The staff was pretty friendly and the whole boarding process was pretty simple and fast.  My major gripe is when I picked up my two dogs four days later, they both smelled really badly, one of them had feces caked to her entire underside with a cut on her back right leg, and as soon as I took them outside they acted as if they hadn't been out to go all day as they immediately went right off the sidewalk (both of them peed and pooped!  - this never happens, usually I have to walk them forever to get them to go).  I did like the fact that they sent me a picture of them during my trip and that they gave me a report card - although the card said both of their bowel movements were normal - but when they went as soon as I took them from the facility, it was both diarrhea.  Overall, the place is nice, folks are friendly...I was just not pleased with the condition of my dogs when I picked them up.
5	LOVE THIS PLACE!  Best Friends treats my baby like no other.  She goes there, and they treat her like she is one of their own.Now, having said this, we haven't taken advantage of the boarding or doggie day-care services.  Sammie gets groomed about every other month and she loves it!  The rates are reasonable ($60 - She's a mid-sized Black Lab/Border Collie Mix), and they think of everything.  They know that I work all day, so they let me drop her off first thing in the morning and pick her up on my way home from work.  After she is finished with her grooming, she plays with the other dogs that are there for Doggie Day-Care.Sammie smells so good when I pick her up and she always has a cute bandana on her.  To add that personal touch, whenever I make an appointment, they ask me if I'd like the same groomer as last time.  Heather is Sammie's "Best Friend".  I know that she will take good care of Sammie whenever I drop her off.  In the end, that's what is most important to me.  I know that Sammie has a great day whenever she goes to Best Friends.
5	I've been bringing Howie here for three years. From grooming with Jill to playtime with Nancy, Amber, Patti and the entire team, to kennel stays...I can't imagine going anywhere else.  Can be a little pricey is you spoil your pet with all the extras, but aren't our furry friends worth it?I think the first might is free. Tell them I sent you!
5	You can definitely trust Best Friends with your little pup.  They have such a sweet staff who definitely love animals!  You are greeted by such friendly people and if you've stayed there before and enrolled your dog in the group play or one-on-one play time, a picture of your dog will come up on their TV screens in the lobby.  What a fun welcome!When it comes to boarding for overnight trips out of town it can be difficult leaving my anxious little fluffball.  So I appreciate that I can sign him up for one on one play time for some extra TLC.  Also fun, they will send you a picture to your phone of your pet playing in the yard or with other dogs--such a sweet gesture that eases my mind when I'm already feeling guilty for leaving him behind.In addition to boarding they do a great job with pet grooming.  It's one of the most expensive places to go but I would say it's usually worth it.  We'd had some crazy shavings and haircuts come out of the cheaper groomers (I'll never forget when he had long hair all over except for a shaved butt...I suppose they were going for a babboon look??)  But at Best Friends they do excellent work and my little pup comes out looking gorgeous.
4	These guys are great!!!My boyfriend took his dog here the other day and they took him without an appointment with no hassles! They did a great job and we got our baby back in a reasonable time! We will be back.
1	This place had availability as we were calling everyone, when we got there it has a strong odor, I asked to see where they were keeping her and they said ohh we will get someone to show u. Once the person came and got us and showed us where she was going to be I almost cried with the loudness of the dogs barking giving me a headache as she was shaking I almost wanted to say forget it but we were in a hurry. I felt as go my dog went to doggy hell. The staff was more mindset on other things then telling us about what she would be doing and if they took them out for potty breaks, I'm guessing they just go in their cage, how gross, so that was disappointing. We dropped her off at 4pm on sat and were told we can only pick her up Sunday between 3-6pm and that the first night free but we got charged for two nights?? Wtf? So we ended up paying $37.00 I never received any pic of her and when I asked about it they pretty much ignored me. I liked Ironton boarding as they seem more in tune with saying hi to your furry friend and facility was calm and collective, and only $22 a night and have the friendliest staff that are always happy to see you. Dogs also get some time to run in a huge play area outside. I will NEVER take my dogs to Best friend pet care ever again!!!
1	I took my dog here to be boarded.  He came home unhappy, but I didn't think much of it (maybe he just missed us).   I used them a second time to groom my dog.  This is where the problem arose.  When I went to pick up my dog, they gave me someone elses pet.  Even though this was a chocolate lab (like mine), it was obviously not my dog.  Then they argued with me saying he was he only chocolate lab they had.  Well....one hour later and 3 other labs (I thought mine was the only one!)...they finally found my dog.  I wouldn't recommend this place unless you hate your dog and want to trade him in for another model.
5	Best friends pet care has been the only place I know my golden retriever will receive the same care and love that I give to him. My coop has been coming here for four years and he acts like every day is his first, he comes in with such excitement and the ladies at the desk know him by name and they get down to his level and hug him and give him lots of petting and complements! Coop gets treated like a king here, he enjoys doggie day-camp, his two bedroom suite with comfortable bedding even I would like to sleep on! Also, coop gets his bubble bath and paw-icure even a nice trim just before I am scheduled to pick him up. Coop then greets me with a big hug when I come to pick him up along with a good report card from the staff at the desk. They all tell me how well behaved he was and they look forward to him coming back. Not only is "best friends" coop's best friends but they are mine too because they love him the way I love my dog!!!
5	I have boarded my pup here on two separate trips in the past month or so for a few nights each time and couldn't be happier.  I was a little hesitant at first since she has never been apart from family, but after researching local places and reading the reviews, I am glad we chose to send her here!They email you pictures of your dog while they are there, which is really nice.  If you call to check up on your dog, they will put you on hold and go check on your dog at that minute and let you know what your dog is up to!  There are so many different options to choose from - single walks with a staff member, general play time, etc.  Also, if you get your dog groomed on the last day of boarding, they will waive that day's fee in lieu of the bath/nails/etc fee which is nice.  They do a really good job with bathing/nails too.They also send your pup home with detailed report cards on how they were each day - even down to the detail of their bathroom schedule & how much food/water they ate.  It is really apparent how much care they put into each dog's visit with them and I feel a lot better about leaving my peanut with them.
1	DANGER: This place is way too small to take in the number of dogs that it takes. The online viewing is deceiving and makes this place look larger than what it is. They will try to take your dog and quickly escort him/her into the play room. However, be sure to ask for a tour and see the space. I took the tour and the space is SMALL. I was there one day and they had 17 dogs in a space the size of my living room. That is dangerous! If something were to happen (ie. a fight) all of the dogs would join (pack behavior) and there would be nothing they could do to protect your pup.
1	I boarded my dogs here and spent thousands of dollars with this place because of our travel schedule. I  lost a lot of money with my business and couldn't afford to get my dogs. When we called they said no payment, no dogs. Ok, I understand but then they tried to say we had abandoned the dog's. They would not give me the dogs and work out a payment plan. They shipped all 3 of my dogs off and won't say where they are. I understand they wanted their money. They sent us to collections and gave my dogs away and said it was in the contract that we signed that they can do that. They said they have no idea where the dogs are now.  When I say we spent a lot of money with them, it was thousands over time when you are paying for multiple dogs. My issue is if you are going to ship my dogs off you could have given them to me and work something out and they never told me they were shipping the dogs off. They told us after they shipped them off! I had to give one star rating but only because u have to.
5	We use them for daycare weekly and we are extremely pleased.  The staff is so nice and they truly care for ALL the dogs that stay with them.  They even give you a  doggy report everyday.  We are VERY happy and Lexi comes home every time just as happy :)
