5	Austen, owner of Elite Upholstery, totally reversed a disastrous outcome I had with another repair company.  My leather sofa cushions had been inexpertly filled with hard foam that didn't even fill the casings, and a tear in the fabric side of one was sloppily stitched and coming apart.  Austen took great care to order the correct foam and then returned the cushions to their original overstuffed, plush condition.  In addition, he expertly repaired the tear.  I'm 100% satisfied and SO glad I found this company.
5	Talk about service.  Called today and my leather couch is repaired.  The repair was done professionally and it did not cost an arm and a leg like the other company I called.  So glad that I searched and found this company.  Total satisfaction!!
5	I just recently had the pleasure of meeting the owner, Austen. I found him by accident but I can tell he is a man of quality and integrity. I have entrusted him with repairing a 6 piece leather sectional. I am looking forward to posting about the excellent work that he does!  :)
5	Electric Recliner done. Never felt more comfortable. 1 piece down...5 to go!
