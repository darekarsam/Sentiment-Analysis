5	Excellent, friendly service. Prices are very reasonable. Will never pay full price again. They also offer secure shredding services.
5	very informative staff. they should call it INSTANT REFILL because they have refill packs ready WITHOUT you having to wait for them to refill it for you. They'll just pick it off the shelf and give it to you.
1	WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS HERE AGAIN! I was told that if I had any issues with my toner it would be exchanged - NOT the case. The owner Goldstein was VERY rude to my stepdad grabbing the toner and phone from his hands! Look elsewhere or simply buy the products from the store as I have had issues with their toners in the past as well.
