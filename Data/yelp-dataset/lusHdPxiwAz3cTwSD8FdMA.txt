1	Horrible customer service! They delivered an arrangement a full day late without any phone call, explanation, or apology. When I called them about it, they didn't even bother with an excuse, nor would they do anything to make it right. Calling corporate is a futile exercise -- a run-around of phone numbers that lead nowhere, everyone passing the buck, and finally being told that the stores are individually owned and there's nothing they can do for me.
5	It was my birthday yesterday and my mom who lives in California wanted to send me something, so an Edible Arrangement it was!  We missed the delivery, so they redelivered it the following morning and I was a little unsure about how fresh the fruit would be, but it is absolutely delic! It is HUGE! the arrangement came with chocolate covered gingerbread men that are actually pineapple cut into men...The chocolate is very good, not cheap tasting like I kind of expected. Its the small arrangement, but I wouldn't call the amount of fruit they put in this small..I might have to bring it to work so it doesn't go bad...there's that much fruit in it!    I am pregnant too, so partly why I think this was a great choice!
5	When you want to send someone flowers but realize that sending them often gets pretty boring, call Edible Arrangements! You can order a custom Fruit arrangement or if your in a hurry, they always have a few made up in their refrigerator! I usually always get one that's in their fridge already made up. I'm a last minute kind of person!Tip: when you go in to order or pick up, ask for a free sample of chocolate covered strawberries, bananas, pear, etc. they always give me one or two! I Love the chocolate covered pears better that any others! Their chocolate is hard but soft and creamy. Not hard shell!
