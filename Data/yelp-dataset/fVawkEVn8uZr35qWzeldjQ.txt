5	Had a great experience here so I figured I'd set up the page. Impeccably clean, great location, choice accomodations, like a bed and breakfast but you get Crepes downstairs at the cafe or make your own (each suite has a kitchen, and the grocery next door is open until midnight.
5	Ditto what Ian said.  I have a full review on Trip Adviser but yea this place is super clean, friendly and safe.  Great location and the grocery store is 2 doors down.  We went on a Living Social deal making it affordable.  Free wifi, tons of closet space and a decent bathroom shower.  The bed was very comfy.  I had no trouble sleeping.
5	This little (eight-room) hotel is in a great location and set up nicely. The bed is comfortable. The in-room kitchen is very nice. I have a cool little balcony with a table and chair.Amenities: front desk staff is very helpful, free wifi, free calls to the US and Canada, shopping and cafes are very close, Place des Arts metro station is nearby.Quirks: no elevator, shower is on the small side, hot water may take several minutes depending on the time of day you use it.I don't have a car here so I can't comment on the parking.
