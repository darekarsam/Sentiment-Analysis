4	Large Indian Market - Clean and well organized! Spices! I took a look at this place while I was here though I primarily stopped in to get directions to Bollywood Bites, figuring since they are Indian they would know!  They did!Friendly helpful staff and patrons told me how to get to Bollywood Bites!
4	Great selection, prices, and staff. Very friendly!
4	First time visit. The place was bright, clean and very well stocked. I wish I knew more about Indian food. I probably would have had a better appreciation for the place if I knew what half the items were. I popped in for Tahini but strolled through the isles for a better understanding of the place. They seemed to offer quite a bit of staple items, dairy and frozen foods. The fresh produce section was tucked in the back and quite small. I will say this however, they had Okra, at least that's what it looked like, that was so large, it was on the verge of being obscene. It made me giggle. Had the very nice employee not been strolling along with me, I would have snapped a photo. I think I will educate myself a little more on Indian cuisine and then venture back in. Hell, even if I don't educate myself, I'll go back for the Okra alone. hehe.
4	India Grocers is now open in the university area. The store is big when compared to other stores in university area. The store is neatly organised and clean. The veggies are fresh comparatively. Staff are very humble and friendly. Kanam Dhokla is very tasty,
