3	What do you want from a foot long hot dog that costs $2?!? Decent taste for this skinny wiener. They actually make the meat look longer by putting it on a shorter bun. Good eats for low pricing, which is always a good thing in my book.This place is located in the back of the Casino Royale. Walk through the drinking and smoking gamblers and get your grub.  If you are not eating inside the casino, you can ask for condiments to go, and they pack up your dogs really well in a plastic, clear bag for you.  if you do choose to dine in, you can have access to a fill it yourself drink service station, and many industrial size condiments.If you are in Vegas, just stop and get one of these dogs to live in the time when Vegas kept multiple cheap eating spots to keep you happy, full and gambling!
4	$3 craps and $1.99 hot dog, nice way to spend a late Vegas night.  Located at the back of Casino Royal, this little gem serves up a bargain in New Vegas prices.  Great to put in the belly after a late night of Vegas.
