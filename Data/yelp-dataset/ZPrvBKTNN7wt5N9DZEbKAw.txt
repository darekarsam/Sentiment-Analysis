5	Jimmy at this location went out if his way to help me return a hat. Sideline Sports has decent people just not at the Tropical Pkwy. location. This is were I'll shop from now on.
3	Located to the left of the Walmart.  This Sideline Sports is small, but carries a ton of your favorite gear.  From hats, accessories, to jerseys of your favorite player, Sideline either has it or can get it for you.  This location is not my favorite in Las Vegas.  I've been to the other locations and this one is my least favorite.  I really hate to post this, but been here at least a half dozen times and felt like the service was below standards.  I've walked in with 3+ employees working with no greet and no acknowledgment.  Just some advice, if you're having a team huddle meeting, have it in the backroom.  Us customers can feel neglected when we see a bunch of employees and get absolutely no service.  Centennial's location is by far better in regards to customer service.  Now you know my face.  A simply hello back would do wonders!!!5 stars for their selection2 stars for serviceWill I be back?  Most likely because I know what I want when I walk in and they sometimes have it.  Will I suggest this Sideline Sports to others?  Probably not.
5	Very friendly crew, very helpful. Let me tried numerous jerseys till I found the right one. Even though i knew what I wanted. Plenty of selections on known players, sadly no Jonikowski for me. This will be my store from now on.
