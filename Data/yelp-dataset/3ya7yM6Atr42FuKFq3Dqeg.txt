3	Nice starting point for walking up one of 7 Hills' seven hils, and you'll be rewarded with an expansive view of the Strip. The park has tennis courts and sand volleyball, and the dreaded basketball courts. Hate'em, they are way too noisy to be in the middle of a neighborhood. Leave them indoors only.
4	Great doggy area and picnic area - restrooms are clean and usable. This park is fairly dark at night with poor lighting so plan your events earlier in the day.  Seven hills is a moderate traffic area, please keep an eye out for wandering children.
