5	I came in here a few weeks ago to get some tickets for Disney land. The lady that helped us was really nice and explained a lot of the different optioins for us.Disney land does not really have great discounts. But, the AAA discount is probaly the best one out there. At least that we could find.We got the 2 day hopper pass and now since we have gone I think the 3 or 4 day would really be the best. Because one day in each place,(Disney land and California Adventure is just not enough time.The really good thing with the AAA discount tickets is you get free parking as well. Which is  a savings of $16.00 a day. So that is really good as well.They are very helpful at the office, they can answer all your questions. There is lots of parking in the lot and the Office is quite large. They even gave me a gift for stopping in and being a long time AAA member.

3	The people are friendly and helpful, but for some reason things always take much longer at AAA than they should.  I just went in to buy a few movie tickets (because they sell the vouchers at a discount), but it took 2 people and 10 minutes to get this done.  This is no fault of the people at this location, but AAA needs to modernize their corporate systems to make things more efficient.
