5	The property manager was great! I was moving to town and she helped make my move easier and was very knowledgable. Great place!
5	I went next door and the gentleman was sleeping and smoked a cigarette right next to me. It was an unprofessional atmosphere. I came into public storage and Tamara did a great job showing me around. Marsha also was very friendly and pleasant. Tamara made me feel this was a safe place for my belongings and she was professional and friendly this is why I chose them  : )
1	Worst experience ever. Tamara called to confirm reservation @ 9:30am, we said we will be there in 1/2 hour and we were on a tight schedule. She said she would be waiting. When we arrived at that time she was gone. After 45 minutes she arrived with some food and said she was at the bank. She was condescending and rude and did not care about or possibly not understand how terrible she was. My money can be spent anywhere I feel that my choice to spend in an establishment is respected. Tamara obviously did not care and didn't mind letting me know.I talked with a person at customer service who didn't want to hear what the problem was and kept repeating "what can I do for you" in a elevating condescending manner.While I appreciate the effort to find a solution this person was obviously not trained in dealing with guests in a manner geared towards producing a positive result. She simply did not care that my decision to spend my money with Public Storage was being crapped on and she added to the pile. I asked to speak to a supervisor and she refused. I asked her name and she hung up.....
5	I'm very impressed with Public Storage on Boulder Hwy in Las Vegas. been doing business with this company for a couple of years and even now . The staff is amazing , helpful. accommodating. curious. friendly and always have a big  smile greeting you  walking in the door. The property is maintained very well always clean and my belongings is safe.
