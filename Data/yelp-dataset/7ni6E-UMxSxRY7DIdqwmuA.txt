5	Oh teeny park of my heart, with your flourish of a stone stage, your acoustics charmed by the lofty towers across the street, your proximity to Romados and Patati for ardent picniking, how I love thee. This will be my 6th year having the pleasure and honour of booking bands and curating art events in the park with Fringe for Indyish and every year it's a highlight. Being right in the middle of the action on St Laurent but in a sunny, tree-lined floaty little oasis is kind of the dream space to bring live music to a stage. Even that one year it rained hard for a few minutes and we ran all over covering the gear with tarps was kind of magical, and in the end the skies always seem to clear on time in Parc des Ameriques.
4	Fringe +Yelp = a rocking good time. The space was perfect for the small crowd that formed and there was plenty of seating. I was def impressed with the lineup of bands (the ones we actually saw anyway). We didn't stay long since we had other plans but it was a great local experience i really enjoyed.
5	Cool little park!  I assume there isn't always a big "Fringe" sign up surrounded by tents.  But as long as they serve beer there I'll be back.   Wait, they won't?  I have to think this one through.  I like parks and all but....I would go back one day in the hope that there is another band playing, and maybe I sneak my own drink in...
3	A smallish park in between 2 of my favourite restaurants in Montreal.  I've come here with food in the past and just relaxed and hung out.  There's not much here UNLESS RISA brings her awesome bands by to play some music during Fringe.  It was there that I learned to use a kazoo!Besides Fringe though it's just a small park in between great neighbourhoods.
4	Cute little Parc,well surrender by local businesses which is cool! I been there only once and had a great time at The Yelp Kazzoo Montreal Fringe Show.Looking forward to another opportunity to go there.
5	its a cute little place!!
