3	When they say "East Valley Sports" they aren't kidding.  Really, I think all school and city teams get their uniforms or sporting equipment at this store, that's why I can't understand why it's so small.  If personal space is important to you, leave your qualms at the door before you come in here because you will be [ass] cheek to [ass] cheek with the other customers.The staff is friendly and very helpful.  They do have the best selection of speedos compared to Dicks, Sports Chalet, and some other places I can't think of the names of off the top of my head.  Somehow, they have a large selection of every kind of sporting good packed into a small area.  No joke- if you're looking for something you can't find anywhere else, call here and see if they have it, I bet they do.
5	This place is great!! Prices beat all the big places and the Internet . Employees know what they are talking about.
5	I love this store! I have been shopping here since I was a kid in sports and now I get all the gear my kids need for their sports. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful, but most of all, patient! They have an AMAZING custom apparel department that not only does most team sports in The Valley, but anything you can dream up; from a family reunion T-Shirt to a shirt for a Fun Run with the girls! Most important, I love that this place is family owned and local!  No sending my money off to some big board of directors!
4	Had a very difficult time finding some baseball tee's at the last minute in a variety of different sizes. When the online shopping options had been exhausted, I reached out to East Valley Sports and they were able to order what I needed from one of their suppliers and it came in two days later.The woman I spoke with on the phone was very pleasant, as well as the employee who rang me up when I came to pick up the shirts.The prices were extremely reasonable and service was great.Would definitely recommend!
