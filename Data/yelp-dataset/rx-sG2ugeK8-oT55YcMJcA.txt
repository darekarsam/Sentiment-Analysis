1	Even by airport standards this place is a huge rip off. I paid $6.25 for some hummus and what did I get? Two small 1 ounce containers and 2 pieces of ciabatta cut into 4s. I get more ketchup with a small order of fries then this place gave me hummus. The fact that it was horrible tasting hummus didn't make me feel better. Avoid at all costs and get a better deal at NYPD right next door.
1	Sadly, a bad review from me.  I bought an overpriced ($9.21) "Caprese" sandwich which, in a word, was disgusting: Soggy focaccia bread, nearly an inch thick of mushy mozzarella, and only a thin slice of tomato with one or two leaves of basil.  I couldn't eat more than a few bites without gagging.  Thank goodness I was on an expense account because this was an utter waste of money.  I would have had the Caprese salad, however when I picked up the container before buying, I noticed that the salad was already swimming in far too much dressing.  Really?This is NOT the kind of food a weary traveler is looking for en route.  Ugh.
1	Got the caprese sandwich, worst sandwich I've ever had in my entire life.  Bread was at least 4 days old.  While thing was just disgusting. Worst part, paid over $10 ew.
