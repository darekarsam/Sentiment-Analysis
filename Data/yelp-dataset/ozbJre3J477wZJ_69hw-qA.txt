5	As a renter I have entered this store twice during some living-in-a-old-house emergencies. Both times I was greeted right away and someone found exactly what I needed. (and it WAS that I needed and it didn't cost something crazy)  Also both times I was readily offered a neighborhood discount.  The only disappointing thing is that they're not open on Sundays.  Despite this -- this place definitely still earns 5 stars.
5	Young staff offer unbelievable customer service, always helpful from the moment I walk in, finding exactly what I need in a friendly manner, even carried road salt out to my car (I didn't ask for help), and modestly refused a tip. Talked me out of trying to buy something more expensive than I needed. Totally 180 experience from the megaplex hardware stores. Same each time I go.
4	Location could be better parking wise, but I always manage to get a good spot.  Helpful, good prices and they give a neighborhood discount for returning customers who live in the neighborhood.   It's one of those -you name it, they got it kind of places with a second level downstairs that is it not obvious from the outside.  Love to see the flowers outside when Spring comes that they sell, very reasonable too.  Very accommodating about some returns I had to make also.
5	Love the 'feel' of this classic hardware store. Everything you would ever need atop creeky oak floors.
