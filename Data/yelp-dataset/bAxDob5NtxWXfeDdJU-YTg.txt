3	Have decided to proceed with proposed treatment plan and Dr Mike Moore. First step is a root canal then eight crowns to complete before end of May. Crowns are $453 each to me after my insurance pays their share. Very high tech equipment and skilled staff. Will review after my treatment plan is accoomplished.
4	Selected Dr Michael Moore because he was in my dental plan and his practice was close to my home. The first phase of my treatment plan was to get 8 crowns across the front top of my mouth. The process took over a month and a half.  The dental assistants especially Samantha who supported Dr Mike were awesome and very professional with great personalities. Dental equipment was real high tech stuff.  Dr Mike is so calm and reassuring when he speaks with you. I felt confident more than anxious.  Now that the 8 crowns are in my mouth, I'm ready to give the experience a thumbs up and recommend people to Dr Mike's practice.
5	I've had Dr Mike treat me since June of this year 2013. He gave me 16 crowns and my smile back. He has truly changed my life.His office staff has been wonderful and so professional.He's the doc you need to correct any dental issues.
5	My family and I have been coming here for several years. The staff is very friendly. I absolutely love my hygienist, Stephanie. I'm one of those people that dreads going to the dentist but when I see her she always takes care of me.
5	What a pleasure it was to visit Moore Dentistry. You cant ask for a better experience. The staff, rates and results are all 5 star! Highly Recommended!
