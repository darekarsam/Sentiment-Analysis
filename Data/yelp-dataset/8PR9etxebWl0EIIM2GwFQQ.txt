3	Service was quick through the drive-through. Location is a bit tricky though.
1	Bad service at  this location
2	The service is ok at best.  Given it's usually a handful of high school kids who work there I tend to be a little more forgiving, but clearly whoever is managing this location and training these kids doesn't have a clue. In fact I've seen the who appears to be the manager be part of the problem...  On at least 5 occasions in the last 2 months I've been at the drive thru waiting for my coffee while it appears to be social hour inside... including the women who seems to be in charge.Last night I ordered 2 sundaes.  They were made and sat at the window for at least 5 minutes while they prepared something for the car in front of me.  When I got to the window I asked why they wouldn't have had the car pull around so my ice cream didn't melt.. that was met with "oh, ya we should have done that."  No offer to remake my sundaes.The original owner/manager had this place running like a top!  Where did he go?
