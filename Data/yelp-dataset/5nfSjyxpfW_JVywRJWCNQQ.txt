5	I've been going to Phantom of the Attic in Greentree for nearly, if not, 20 years now. There is nowhere in Pittsburgh that I'd rather go. The owner, Ron, is deeply involved and knowledgeable on everything comics & RPG related. If you need help, Ron is there to offer it. Need to find something? Ron will go out of his way to make it happen. I've had many a Christmas & Birthday saved because Ron found what I couldn't. New monthly comics, gaming card packs, subscriptions, graphic novels, out of print material, weird shit (like my Punisher bottle opener), Ron does it all! If you LOVE superheros, this place is a MUST VISIT! If you've got a superhero lovin' friend, this is the place to find unique gifts that'll make you the hero! Nuff said!
4	This is my current local comic book shop, and it's pretty nice. It's well-organized, clean, and is a nice alternative to having to go downtown for your weekly comics.It has a pretty wide selection of current titles, but the selection of back-issues isn't huge. There's a medium sized bookshelf with a few dozen action figures if you're into that, and one of the walls is lined with various board games and RPG type stuff. Prices seem pretty solid across the board, this place isn't going to mark-up your items.The store is run by Ron, and he's a really nice dude. Tell him Ed sent you.
