3	My experiences  with comcast have been quite the opposite. They have been helpful and often very helpful. They react to problems fast.
1	DO NOT USE COMCAST XFINITY SERVICES. Worst service, ever. Horrible experience on the phone with them. They took a payment off my credit card and applied it to someone else's account and then said mine would be delinquent because 'they don't have a payment from ME'. The rep said I would have to dispute the charge with my bank but that doesn't have anything to do with them. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO TOOK THE PAYMENT. When I said I'd cancel service he said, "if we don't have anything else to talk about then I guess this conversation is redundant." Smh.
