5	These days, it can be a significant challenge locating a precision barber in this valley. When a gentleman requires 12-15 cuts per year, it's important to find consistency.Highly recommend the Glendale Barber Shop. Been in operation since the 1920's with more than 50 years experience amongst the barbers there. Nice men's haircut with an excellent taper. 9am-6pm weekdays, including Mondays. 8am-4pm on Saturday.Remember: it pays to look well.
5	Came from out of town to get my haircut and a shave. Did an A+ job. Go here if you want quality.
5	I had my first haircut here many years ago. My Dad started getting his haircut here when he was 10.  There are few places where you can get the kind of service that reminds you of a different time and place in our society.Danny is one of those people who is more like extended family than a Barber. He has been there throughout the ups and downs in life, listening and offering advice and his own life experiences on things.This is a place where memories are made, friendships are formed, and traditions are past down from generation to the next.If you stop in, ask Danny about his Halloween scare story and you'll be sure to have a good laugh- while establishing your own memories!
