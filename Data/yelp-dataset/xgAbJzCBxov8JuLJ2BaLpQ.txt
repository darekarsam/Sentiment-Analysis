1	I only wish less than one star were available review!!  This website sells keyless devises to replace OEM remote entry keyfobs, only problem..they don't work!!  Refunds aren't given and you cant talk to them on the phone.  The factory auto dealer couldn't program them..said they were previously programmed.  The number one locksmith in my tri-state area couldn't program them said their machine said "take them to the dealer"..I'm paraphrasing of course.  I should have done my research first, but didn't, there are many negative reviews on the web about this sham company, the BBB has only negative reviews and does not give their approval.PLEASE avoid this company.
1	Wished I had looked up the site here on yelp before making my order.  I've paid for a remote back in Sept. 19 and until now (Oct. 14) nothing.  Just an email saying my purchase was 'authorized'.  I'm now trying to get my money back.DO NOT RISK YOUR MONEY HERE.
1	I've also had the unfortunate experience of having dealt with this company in the past as well. However, if it's any consolation to anyone else, the Arizona St. Attorney General's office is finally taking action against these scam artists, and they are now no longer in business.
