4	My experience here was pleasant and comforting. My doctor was knowledgeable, professional and friendly. Pam, her nurse, whom I had a lot of my visits with shared personal experiences and always made sure that my health and well being was priority. They offered many services as well as packages to save money. I took advantage of some cleansing and weight loss packages, just to get on track and feel more healthy. I learned about nutrition and healthy eating and what methods to use for quickly and safely dropping a few extra pounds. Even if you don't know exactly what you are looking for or where to start, I think the staff here can guide you. Their B12 shots and recommendations for fish oil and B Vitamin consumption seemed to help me and I will be replenishing my supply soon! If you're in this area, or even if you're not (I drove up from Chandler on my lunch hour!) check them out to see what products and services they can help you with!
5	The first treatment worked wonderfully and I was happy to show off my legs on the beaches of Costa Rica. Today, I'm back again from another treatment  and Dr. Nelson does a top notch job. The staff is very friendly and call to remind you of your appointment.
1	Purchased a groupon for schlerotherapy and was told the latest appointment available was 3:30 pm.  I work downtown, so took off work to do this.  Was running a little late so called, was told I would have to rebook because there was another appt after me.  Gee, thought I was the last appointment.   The appt times are limited, and not conducive to those of us who work!  And then not accommodating, probably because it's a groupon!
5	I have been going here for over a year and I love this place. I do B-12 and Lipotropics, Botox, and Juviderm. I am always very pleased with my results and always get compliments. The staff and doctors are very friendly.
