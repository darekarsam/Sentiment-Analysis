4	Today was the first time I ever had a facial, and it was such a great experience! Kelly was very friendly and professional. She took time to explain the treatment and made sure I was completely comfortable the entire time. The whole experience was so relaxing. I opted to have the facial of the month which was a peppermint and orange/berry facial. Kelly also gave me some advice on how to handle my dry skin during the winter. The salon that The Skin & Co. is located in is very nice, clean, and modern. I would definitely recommend The Skin & Co. if you have skin issues that you need help with or if you are just looking for some relaxation.
5	Kelly is a magician! I've become frustrated with the past few estheticians I've seen for waxing because they made me feel rushed. Kelly takes the time to make sure all those stray hairs are gone and that I'm happy with my legs. She even goes after the strays with a tweezer!  She pays extra attention to any sensitive spots, and is able to recommend products. Everything she sells appears to be of great quality. I'm hooked!
