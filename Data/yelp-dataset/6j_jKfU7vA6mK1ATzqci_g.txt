4	Founds this karaoke bar thanks to the Yelp app:) It doesn't look like much from the outside, but Bar La Bouche is a karaoke-lover's dream. Service was great (although if you don't order drinks at the start, you have to go out to the bar to order) and the spacious rooms are tres chic with purple velvet cushions and mood lighting. The lobby is pretty ballin' with neon lights and a mini dance floor. Findings songs is easy with the touch screen listings (no clunky old binders!), although you made need help initially to find the English selection as the main menu is in Chinese. You add your songs and it's easy to see the list and refer back to it later. -1 star because their selection is not the greatest, especially for newer stuff. There were several songs or artists we were looking for that they didn't have. Drinks - they have beer and some bottled vodka-based drinks, but other than that it is 'bottle service' style. You can order tea as a mixer to go with your liquor. However, the prices for bottles is really expensive, upwards of $150 each. Overall, a great place to sing some tunes with your friends. We got a medium room which can accommodate up to 12 people and is a bargain for $35 per hour. I think I've found my new go-to karaoke spot in Montreal!
1	1.  limited american songs.  no journey.  no rolling stones.  missing lots of basics.  2. i was attacked by a great dane  belonging to an employee and feel fortunate to have my fingers still attached. 3.  I went to pay with credit card and was told to use cash to save 15% and then never got my credit card back.  It was stolen by the employees who then went shopping with it and racked up 500 dollars in charges. so do not go here if you want to sing, like having fingers, or have valuables.
