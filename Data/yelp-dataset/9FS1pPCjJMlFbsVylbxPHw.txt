3	slacker smells like maaad incense.they sell lots of good magazines that you don't see many other places. and they also have a large variety of hair dyes.the clothes are alright. but that's just me. they have some pretty cool jewelry.but i bought a ring for like 15 dollars there and it totally turned my finger green. i guess i should've asked first though... but oh well.
4	One of those little independent stores every city seems to have, that is a combination of Hot Topic, Spencer's, and an adult toy store. I enjoy going in even if I don't always buy something.
5	This place was stumbled upon after my son and I went to an incredibly cool toy store across the street, while on a walking tour of Carson & the Obey murals that were adorning a few of the buildings in the area.  As was previously mentioned, it's a combination Hot Topic/Spencers, but it's an indie, and the owner is AWESOME.  I ended up having a 10 minute long conversation with him about his old days helping out Shepherd Fairey as he scouted locations for the Obey Murals and his history of stickering the city w/ the Giant sticker campaign.  They used to sell Obey prints for a mere $35 dollars, some of which are now worth over a thousand bucks.  He wasn't trying to "name drop", instead, just relaying old stories to someone like me who was obviously a fan of the brand.  I bought a bunch of Obey stickers myself to take home and adorn my photo booth at work with.  Thanks for the courtesy Slacker, I enjoyed your store!-Jake
3	Holy overpriced metal band t-shirt batman.
5	Carson Street staple with fun merchandise and reasonable prices.  I bought a great David Bowie t shirt there & some incense (not patchouli) ;-)
