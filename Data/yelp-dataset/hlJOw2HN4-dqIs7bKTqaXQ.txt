5	Back in April I had major issues with my A/C Compressor and Serpentine belt.  They fixed these issues at a fair market rate, according to a few references and reviews I'd read online.  Now on Oct 19th I had the exact same problem, I dropped of on my way to work, and worried about the bil.  I got my warranty through them the first time, making the trip absolutely FREE!!Car runs great again, ice cold A/C, and the power steering is smoother than it has ever been.Thanks Guys!!Ryan
3	I have to be completely fair and say that, I would have given them 5 stars had, the manager not try to give me a quote that was utterly ridiculous. I went in for just a simple brake job, including ONLY new pads! Somehow my drums needed to be replaced and a whole heap of other stuff had to be done.  I was highly upset, but, Thanks to the Front Desk Guy, I was helped and he saved me a ton of cash by showing me the deals and urging me to stick to my budget and the purpose of my visit.
4	Nobody likes to hear that awful screeching from your breaks going out on the car...all I hear is money...leaving my wallet. I stopped into Brake Masters and the guys were all very helpful. They did a complimentary brake inspection. It turned out that my front brakes were completely worn out. I didn't have time to get them fixed that day so they gave me a printed quote and told me to come back asap. I returned two days later and they remembered me and my car right away. I dropped the car off and they called a few hours later saying it was ready. They honored the original price quote and actually gave me a discount. They never tried to sell me anything extra. Thanks guys for making this a great experience.
1	Man, this place cost me a ton of money and did crappy work.  The brakes they use are metal, so the crud on my wheels was nasty and the life of the brakes was fleeting.  When they would fix one thing, lo and behold something else needed to be fixed.  Mainly my fuel pump, which caused my car to have major start issues once replaced.  The fuel pump was because my gas guage suddenly stopped working after they had replaced my struts.  They could never get my tires balanced.I regret the money they took from me and think about 1/2 the work they did on my car was not necessary.
1	I took my car here to see if they would warranty any work from the Germann and Gilbert Road locations. They would not do anything... These guys are just as much of A**HOLES as the other one. I had a Manager who runs the stores in the Area, take a look at my car, and he also did nothing. First off if you are a Manager have some courtesy, DON'T YELL AT CUSTOMERS! Second you should not be a MANAGER of a Car Repair Shop if you CAN'T FIX YOUR OWN CAR.My Review from Germann and Gilbert:_________________________________________________________________These People are the Rudest A**holes ever. First off after Charging close to $600 worth of work, then broke my car. My Brake pedal was almost to the floor, and they told me it was my back brakes. They adjusted the back brakes and there was NO CHANGE in pedal height. They striped 4 bolts on the "Upper Oil Pan" (engine). They do not even stand behind they're work. I took my car to another mechanic and I was told it was the Brake Power Booster. I got it replaced CORRECTLY and now my brakes work great (not thanks to these A**HOLES!)_________________________________________________________________
3	Thank you Brake Masters for making a horrible experience into a pleasant experience. I visited the Dobson & Chandler Blvd location #169 on February 17, 2014 to have my brakes checked. Unfortunately the wait was longer than expected and I left without getting any service whatsoever. I was not pleased! I expressed my thoughts on social media how dissatisfied I was and within a matter of time, Mr. Huy Nguyen (area manager~East Phoenix) made a personal phone call to me.  He listened to my concerns and Mr. Nguyen asked if Brake Masters could have the opportunity to regain my confidence and allow Brake Masters another chance to service my car.  Mr. Nguyen offered to meet me at the location and I fully agreed to allow Brake Masters to service my car.    After speaking/meeting Mr. Nguyen, he truly takes pride in ensuring customer satisfaction is met as well as supporting the integrity of Brake Masters.  I was very impressed he took the time to listen to me and he did not make excuses.  He expressed customer satisfaction, professionalism and customer feedback is a top priority. He was very sincere and truthful! I would personally like to thank Mr. Nguyen, Greg (assistant manager) and staff for turning a horrible experience into a positive and pleasant one. Thanks for making things right!
2	Went to Brake Masters today to get a simple brake fluid flush on my wife's 4runner as it had a bit of a spongy pedal. When I arrived Steve greeted me and checked me in. The tech took it for a test drive to verify the concern. Took my other vehicle for a car wash and came back 15 minutes later and they were already lowering it from the lift. We drove home. The pedal felt much better, but noticed a funny noise coming from the front end. When I got home I looked under the vehicle and there was brake fluid all over the wheel wells, the control arms and the inside of the tires. They also managed to get my headlight dirty. I immediately called Steve to let him know and he apologized and told me to bring it in the morning so they can clean it up. Not Acceptable! A simple flush turned into a mess. I had to power wash the whole front end because their tech did not pay attention to detail. Makes me wonder if they are capable of doing bigger jobs. I was a tech at a dealership and just took it because I was on a time crunch. You definitely get what you pay for! No thanks never again.... I also do have pictures that I took of the mess in case anyone would like to see.
