3	I went here for a sugar shack dinner. The food was fatty and sweet, which was expected and great! The food seemed to keep on coming and unending. Not to mention the maple taffy at the bar.
1	Horrible service. Terrible experience.Went out of our way while on vacation to visit Lobby Bar for an oyster party. Our orders were taken as we sat at the bar and then we waited and waited and waited _ while everyone around us (people that arrived after us PS by the way) received their food.If you are not a local don't bother going there.
