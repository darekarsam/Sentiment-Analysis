4	Daughter has been there for two months. So far she seems to be enjoying it. Everyone is very friendly. However, the tuition keeps increasing just a little at a time, hence only four stars.
4	My son was 33-months old when I took him there. Teachers and management were very friendly. I loved Shawna and Sheryl most of all. They're very friendly with the kids.
1	Teachers clearly have no or little schooling to be qualified to handle pre school children.   Maybe just this Tutor Time (I don't know) but this is the worst day care I have shamefully paid for. Credentials for these teachers are high school diplomas, and seems they dress up like clowns more often opposed to having a professional approach. Would not recommend this day care to anyone... Bright horizons is well worth the extra drive.
1	Found my son on the floor crying when he was 3 months old. Literally face down on the floor screaming his face off... Teacher was sitting in a chair feeding another baby a bottle. I get it, you're busy, but at least roll my kid back on the tummy time mat or put him in a swing. Never went back.
