5	The chillest coffeehouse to hang out in the Charlotte area. It's a Church setting with the best coffee and hot chocolate known to man (seriously.) and the people are great. Most recently I saw Flowers for Faye play and there were about 20 people there, not to crowded, and very comfortable. If you're looking for a comfy Friday or Saturday night just hanging out and drinking awesome coffee, The Well Church and Coffeehouse is the best place to be.
5	Coffee Houses need bands and be a place for people to MEET, relax, have fun and have open discussions.  If the Coffee and Hot Chocolate are GREAT that adds to the experience but not that much for me.  When I look for a Coffee House this is what I want!!!  Check their website for upcoming events, like Bands and new music release parties.This is a COZY, comfortable place, though bigger than it looks from the outside.
5	Love this place.  Great music, good coffee, friendly staff.  Great place to go and hang out, talk with people and relax.  Highly recommended.  Also, check out their worship services, when they're not just a coffee house!
5	I have never actually been there in person, but I have caught some of it on live-streaming.  And I know Todd and Tracie and they are two of the most genuine, interesting, intelligent, and kind people I have ever known.  I live in Chicago, so I rarely get to see them, but when I do, the conversations are EPIC and can go late into the night, touching on things you would never even think of with anyone else.  Everyone should have people like them in their lives.  Also, I love coffee.  If you love coffee, you should TOTALLY go check it out.  And if you hate coffee, I am sure they've still got ya covered.  Because that is just the kind of people they are.
