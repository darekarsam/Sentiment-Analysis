4	Friendly staff.Fast check-out. Great selection.
1	In the store today 2 times.....first AND last! I have never experienced such an unfriendly staff & the store is a mess.
2	This place is a disaster!  Messy aisles, a few food items I picked up had days left before expiration, some prices the same as a regular grocery / discount store, and staff members who had a hard time with the English language.  I'm sure you can save a few bucks shopping here, but for me it's not worth the hassle.
2	God awful service. The cashier didn't say ONE word to me. Not even one! There's food on the ground and merchandise misplaced throughout the store. The owner of this 99 cent only store really needs to get his or her act together.
1	Ughhh this is the WORST 99 cent only store. It is so freaking dirty. Seriously,  who manages this place??? The workers are down right lazy and rude. I wonder if they keep their home the same way?! Everything is misplaced all over the place and trash all over the ground. And the customers there let their bay bay snot nosed kids run around. It just seems like everyone (the customers and cashiers) don't give a damn about their personal hygiene and cleanliness. Learned my lesson to never, ever go back.
