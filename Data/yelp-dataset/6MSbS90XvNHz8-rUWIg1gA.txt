4	Pretty good as Canadian Tires go. Big store, lots of inventory. Of course there's always that annoying schmuck at the front door that wants to sign you up for that stupid credit card, but hey...
4	one of the cleanest store out there and combine with their instore search engine makes it so much easier to find things. let's not forget the self checkout. basically, if you don't want to interact with anyone, this is the store to go to. i forgot, you do have to interact with the lady at the cash registry for your canadian tire money though
1	This review is for the automotive "services" I received there recently. I brought in my car just for a simple seasonal tire switch. My regular mechanic couldn't take me and of course being the impatient type (plus winter was TOOOO long this year) I really wanted to put my summer tires on. Well, I was greeted very nicely and told it would be an hour wait. No problem. The store itself is big, clean and well stocked. I then get paged to be told that I needed 1000$ of suspension and brake repairs!!! I had just got the car fully inspected a month before by my regular trusted mechanic since I want to trade the car and he found nothing wrong with the suspension or brakes. I told them thanks for the tip, please put my tires on that is it. Be careful, there was an Area Manager that day in the garage and they were trying really hard to upsell or promote BS repairs on a lot of customers. I witnessed another customer tell off the service tech regarding BS repairs. Honestly I rarely go to CT for automotive services, but can tell you the LaSalle branch is a lot more honest than these crooks.
