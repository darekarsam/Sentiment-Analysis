3	This place is a restaurant of the chain pub variety. It's okay for that. The food is nothing to write home about. It does, however, have an indoor soft play that is cheap and large, though it is dark inside. It's a good place for a rainy afternoon in which you drink some generic cider and your kid wears him or herself out. There are certainly nicer restaurants nearby but the soft play is kind of a secret bargain.
2	I visited this well recommended franchise in June 2014. The service was better than most eating establishments, the layout is good, there was plenty of parking, the tables are nice, the till operator explained the buffet process clearly, as did the carvery person. The prices were reasonable and all the staff are friendly and polite. I was therefore very surprised to find the meal quite bland and tasteless despite the presentation being very good. The roast potatoes in particular lacked flavour and the roast beef was tough. What a pity!
