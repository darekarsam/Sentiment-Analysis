4	Gets really crowded, but they have the best corn and floor tortillas! They make them daily and are just delicious. They often had really good deals on food and stuff, especially on produce and meats. They also have a seafood market with fresh fish, shrimps and much more. If you ever come by make sure you get there really early in the morning or late at night, you won't have to worry about so much traffic and parking. Take some of their rotisserie chicken, you will thank me later!
5	Love this place. Fresh meats, produce, deli,  seafood and a wonderful restaurant of mexican food area.
5	Ok, so I'd be repeating my review of the camelback and 67th ave location.  Ditto for Roosevelt and 16th st and southern and central. They are great! And new owners have done plenty to improve the locations! During the chilly evenings I recommend the champurrado. It's made different here than what I'm used to but it's delicious on its own right.
1	the signs are in the wrong spots, the aisles are narrow in most areas and way to wide in one or two. I can forgive all this, except for the lack of organization on where the items are. there is a problem if I spend 45mins finding salt.
