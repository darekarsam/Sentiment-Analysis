5	Meghan did my hair and makeup (and my MOH hair/makeup and Mom's hair) for my wedding in July.  I can't say enough great things about it - I was getting compliments on how stunning I looked all day long!  She was friendly, easy to work with, and didn't make me look *too* made up.  I'm not generally a makeup wearer, and she made sure to keep me comfortable - it was 90 degrees out, and my makeup didn't budge!    She did a GREAT job, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her services to anyone!
5	I've had the pleasure of working with Meghan on several occasions; hair and make-up for a wedding, waxing and hair cutting.  Meghan is very easy to work with, has incredible attention to detail and is very thorough.  I can't say how thrilled I am every single time I take a look in the mirror.  Meghan is fashion forward and very creative with out making you look like someone you are not.  This is a special skill that I totally appreciate.  I would recommend her services to anyone who needs to be beautified.   as a bonus the products she uses are the best of the best.
5	My hair was quite the mess, in need of cut and color. Meghan colored/highlighted/cut my hair.  She took my idea and expanded it. I look AMAZING!!!! I completely endorse Meghan and her Fabulous skill and ideas!
5	Meghan recently did my hair and makeup for a boudoir session.  I came from another state and most of our communication was done online.  She had a clear vision of what I wanted an executed it perfectly.  My eyes were stunning and my hair was exactly how I had envisioned.  We laughed and talked the whole time like I had known her for quite a while.  Meghan is personable and talented.  I don't know much about hair and makeup but I know she is a true artist in every sense of the word.  Thank you Meghan!
5	love meghan! talented young lady and very professional!
