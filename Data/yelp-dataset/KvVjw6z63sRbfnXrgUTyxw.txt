1	I went to healthy habits for the first time today and had the most horrible experience.   The staff was unprofessional and had no idea what they were doing.  The masseuse was polite but was not quite sure how to give a massage.   There was no manager or person in charge and the staff is not even sure how the pricing works.    I was terribly disappointed and feel like I wasted my money.  If you are considering a massage here I would recommend that you reconsider and go elsewhere.   This place is a joke
5	I have been to both the original location in Surprise many times and the newest location in Glendale twice, and my experiences have been great across the board! I have received two massages from Tim most recently at the Glendale salon, and I find him to be knowledgeable, professional and very capable in addressing my issues (related to past car-accident injuries and also the fact that I work out regularly and experience the accompanying muscle aches and strains). In posting my review, I happened across two previous reviews that were none too kind -- and I have to wonder if there is some motivation to discredit Healthy Habits, only because I personally know so many people who have benefited from receiving therapy there. At any rate, Healthy Habits always has provided me a great massage at an affordable price, and I plan to continue bringing my business here ... especially now that there's a location so conveniently close to home.
5	Healthy habits is a wonderful affordable massage studio where you can get a great relaxation massage or therapeutic massage. The front desk staff is very friendly and I've never had to endure a sales pitch like at some other massage places. All of the massage therapists I have been to are knowledgable and friendly. They even have weekly specials like ladies night on Tuesdays and men's night on Thursdays,
