5	My husband & I just bought a small condo for when we visited our family and we needed a mattress. After looking at a few other "pushy" mattress stores, we randomly walked into this store. There are two Mattress Firm stores a few hundred feet apart (not related). We were warmly greeted by Ty (store mgr). He was direct, honest, and knowledgeable. We are now getting our new mattress delivered free ,with other incentives , tomorrow. Couldn't be more pleased!
5	Great place to buy a mattress! My son had lots of toys and activities so he had fun while I found him the perfect mattress. Great service and friendly employees.
5	Ricky at Mattress Firm was amazing. He was very knowledgable and was able to answer all of our questions. If you need a mattress don't look anywhere else. This is the only place you need to go.
