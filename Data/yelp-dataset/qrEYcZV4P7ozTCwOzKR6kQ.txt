5	Probably one of the best luxury apartment complexes I've ever lived in. They have a friendly staff that greets you every time you leave or come home, complimentary coffee and tea service every morning- that's actually good coffee! The amenities are great (on the rare occasion I might work out) the gym has all of the equipment you need! The pools & tennis courts are kept very clean, but, the best part is the people who rent here-- they're actually business professionals and people with second homes- not a lot of riffraff that you get at some of the other complexes located on or around the strip!
5	Definitely one of the finest properties in Las Vegas. The location is outstanding with great access to The Strip, McCarran, the highways and tons of other Vegas locales. The building and facilities are immaculate. The Valets, Concierge & security team are the ultimate professionals. We bought a unit as a vacation home in 2011 and its tranquil, safe and a fun place to getaway to.
