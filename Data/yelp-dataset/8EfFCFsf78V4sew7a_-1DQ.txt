1	This hotel is the definition of a nightmare. We were not supposed to be staying here, but because of our original hotel being overbooked we were forced to stay here. The staff were beyond rude, including the manager. The facilities were barely clean, completely outdated, and smelled like mold.When we checked in late at night the desk clerk told us to park in the lot beside the hotel because their parking was full. We did so, but in the morning the parking lot owner came up and demanded that we pay him in full. We took this up with the hotel staff and they essentially implied we were lying. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!
4	This updated European hotel is conveniently located in downtown Montreal. It's within walking distance to major attractions like old Montreal but outside the expensive hotel zone. The rooms are modern, spacious, and clean. The staff are helpful and friendly . There's a restaurant on the main floor that seems ok with the locals but I didn't have a chance to eat there. The prices looked a bit higher than other local eating establishments.I highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again. There are plenty of  lesser known but interesting neighbourhoods I would like to explore next time I visit the city. Hotel Lord Berri would make an excellent stay on a return trip.
