4	Delicious little restaurant.  I cannot say much for the authenticity of this small yet elegant Vietnemese restaurant, but I can say that the food was well prepared and tasty.  My boyfriend and I decided to eat here after passing by hundreds of times, and finally decided "tonight is the night".  We both went for the table d'hote, and it was a lot of food!  I started with a very interesting soup (it was a clear broth with tapioca pearls), moved onto fried tofu (not greasy or overly chewy like it often is), and then had the salt and pepper seafood dish.  The portions are large, but manageable if you have a large appetite.  The meal ended with a mousse cheesecake type cake, and tea and coffee.  My partner commented that a place gets bonus points when they automatically serve espresso at the end of a meal.  I have to agree.Throughout service was attentive but not overly "in your face".
