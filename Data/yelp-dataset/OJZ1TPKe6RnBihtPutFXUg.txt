4	PIZZA PIZZA PIZZA!  Yeah we came here expecting to order fish and chips, but they had such a tempting selection of pizzas that we decided to go for it. We each ordered a different pizza, and we extremely impressed. The crust and sauces were homemade, and everything tasted super fresh. We also ordered salads and these were terrific too. The restaurant looks sketchy from the outside, and the decor inside is a bit spartan as well, but the food is really good and the service was great too. I'd definitely go back.
