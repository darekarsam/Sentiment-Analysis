1	It's all goodz is not "all good"..  The guy with the huge beanie on... not helpful.. most of their pieces were blown in house which of course means uneven percs and downstems with poorly cut slits.  I'm no glass blower.. but I know what to look for and what NOT to look for. When the cuts in the downstem are suppose to be laser slits and they come out looking serrated something is wrong.  I'm not stupid.  I asked "The beanie Guy" if he had carbon filters.  He said that his glass blower was making some now and it would be a couple weeks till they recieved them.  He then said he was suprised i knew what a carbon filter was because they dont mass produce them yet..  He told me that they were the only glass shop in AZ that would have them.  And the ones he made were "custom" built.  I kept my mouth shut. I walked out the store drove down the street to Coughing Canary and bought one there.  I went home to aqualabstechnologies.com afterwards and found a couple nice worked ones also.I CAME BACK A SECOND TIME AND IT WAS EVEN FUNNIER!I walked in to buy a pack of swishers. And asked the guy if they were fresh. He replies that he didnt know but that they were foil wrapped and are always fresh.  so i asked him if i could squeeze it.  He doesn't let me touch the box =( says it ruins the product.  It was weird but w/e i bought it. They were crunch.. dick.
1	I spent just over $20 with tax for some 10x Salvia. I'm not even convinced that it was really Salvia. I smoked a lot of it, and the effects were weak and brief. I will never shop at this ripoff store again.
