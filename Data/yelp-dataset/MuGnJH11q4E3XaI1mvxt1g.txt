2	Overpriced.This salon is ok; they cut my hair, made small-talk with me and tried to get me to buy all of their various products. But let's be honest, that describes pretty much any salon you've ever been to. The difference is, even with student discount I paid nearly twice what I pay to get the same thing done in the salon in Harvey Nicks.Also, I felt really self-conscious because the staff all just stare at you, and don't even try to hide the fact that they're talking about you amongst themselves. Don't get me wrong, they did cut my hair well. But for the price I paid I would have expected nothing less. Aside from that, there is really anything else on the things-that-are-good-about-it list.
