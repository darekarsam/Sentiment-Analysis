3	Food was good but the service was mediocre.
1	The service was horrible. I went in on my lunch hour and asked for a sandwich. The boy who was helping me kept asking "what" everytime I answered his question. I'm not a soft spoken person. When he added my cheese he mistakenly used 3 peices on my 6 inch. However once he noticed,  he throw away the extra cheese slice. My person opinion, if you are goind to throw away food, just keep it on the sandwich. Such a waste. The worst part was he started COUGHING while he was making my food! At that point I politely told him I would not take the sandwich and his response was, of course "what?" I used to come here for lunch all the time, now I won't be returning.
