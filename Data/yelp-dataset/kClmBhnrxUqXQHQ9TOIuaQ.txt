5	Note Dame might be the most well known church in Montreal, but St Patricks is by far my favorite. It is not frequented by many tourists, which makes it the perfect hidden gem. It is the only all english church in Montreal. Originally built for the irish immigrants. Being Jewish...i know NOTHING about catholic mass except that you kneel, eat crackers and give money. However, this was a beautiful mass and I felt to lucky to have experienced it.The inside is breath taking with its high ceilings and huge chandelier surrounded by carved angels. As the service started, the sun shone through the numerous stained glass windows and reflected on the alter and the floor to ceiling carvings of St. Patrick. This is the church to go see in Montreal.
5	I've been there several time. It blend in the decor and it's hardly foundable but this place is amazing. Belivers and Non-Believers. The wood collon is impressive. It was renovated last year. One of the most impressive part of this church is definetely the quietness in the middle of Downtown Montreal and the craftmanship required for such a beautiful paint job. you'll understand when you'll go.
5	My favourite church in Montreal! It's beautiful and everyone is incredibly welcoming
5	Stunning! the Sacred Heart Chapel is just marvelous. so modern and in complete contrast to the charm and beauty of the main church. A definite must see as a stop in Old Montreal.
