5	This is my local Jiffy Lube, and I've had great experiences so far at this location. I've dropped my car off here 4 times, and each time, I go over to the pizzeria in the shopping center, grab a slice, and by the time I get back, my car is ready. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and they tend to avoid the hard-sell techniques that can get pretty annoying at some of these places. Between the great prices, convenient location, speed, and clever staff, this has become my go-to spot for oil changes and basic automotive service.
1	what a crazy place.they forgot to put oil in my car so the area manager robert suggested putting play-dough in the motor to "soften" the knock coming from it.then he told me my momma looks like bo-bo the dancin' clown.kinda funny considering this place was being ran like a three-ring circus.this place is sure to make you laugh and cry all at the same time....BEWARE
1	I have had 2 experiences with this place. The first time was when I brought my 1974 Corvette in for an oil change. The filter they used was missing the oil sealing ring and when I started the car, my oil was left laying on the ground. The second and final experience was when I brought my daughters Chevy Malibu in for service. They wound up putting the wrong coolant in the radiator which they couldn't (wouldn't) properly repair and I wound up having to get rid of the car. Would never go there again and I tell everyone I know to beware!
1	the place where all you gotta have is a record to work there!!!sweet!!!
