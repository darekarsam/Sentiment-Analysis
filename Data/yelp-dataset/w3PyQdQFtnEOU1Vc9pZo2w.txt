5	LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  The instructors are AWESOME!!  I am brand new to yoga, and they have been so kind.  There truly is no judgement here.  I suggest it to anyone at any level.
5	This place is simply amazing.  I took my first yoga class ever just barely 2 months ago and I must say it has changed my life in so many ways. I was worried that I'd be intimidated by being overweight, short, and clumsy. But NC Yoga (particularly Michael) guide you through at your own pace, yet encourage you to challenge yourself . The meditation and breathing practices are absolutely magical for me. And I'm usually a very angry, sarcastic, anxious person. Now, I have a whole new attitude. After 2 months I am so much calmer, stronger, and limber. My energy has practically doubled. I leave my Morning Inspiration class twice a week feeling like a new woman. On top of that, I've lost 12 lbs and the only thing I've been doing differently is the new addition of yoga at NC Yoga. Everyone who works there is SO friendly and appreciative that you just showed up to class. They have everything you need to help your poses such as bolsters,straps and blankets and blocks and at the end of every class, a lovely lavender scented cold towel during your savasana. They also have private showers if you need to change for work. I don't think I've ever seen anyone leave NC Yoga without a smile on their face (myself included). I can't emphasize enough how wonderful this place is. Love it! Love it! Love it!
1	This place is terrible. The teacher had NO idea what she was doing. I felt she was potentially harmful. Stay away from this loser studio!!!
4	Good variety of classes, $5 community classes, hot yoga, and I anm pretty sure it's the only game in SW Charlotte to boot. I definitely would go back.
