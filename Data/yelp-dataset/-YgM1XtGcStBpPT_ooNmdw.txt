1	So RUDE! I got there almost 11 p.m. and they close on Sunday at 11 p.m. I pulled up to the window and the lady looked at me and turned away and then just walked away from the window. I understand if you're closed and not surving food anymore but you could be nice enough to tell me and not ignore me...
3	its a nice stop on the way to pineville and has a captain D's in the same building! so a little bit for everyone.
1	It's a pretty dumpy place. They burnt my crunchwrap along with sour cream in which I asked them specifically not for any. Terrible service. Will not eat there again and I would recommend it to anyone else.
5	Taco Bell's new breakfast menu is awesome! The AM Crunchwrap is good as advertised. Taco Bell is now my new top choice for fast food breakfast.
1	Hahahahhahhahah.  What a joke. First we ask the counter girl what's in this new thing they had and she didn't know so she asked a fellow employee/cook and he didn't know either. Anyway we ordered and had to wait @ 15 minuets for my change. I handed here a $20 bill and they act like it was a $100 bill. Also I recommend not to use the rest rooms. Filthy filthy filthy. Looked one a jailhouse bathroom.  When I spoke with the manager I asked her if she gave a sh** and I don't believe so.
