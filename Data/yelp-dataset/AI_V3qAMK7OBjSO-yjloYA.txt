4	10% off for students Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday. 50% off rack for veggies/fruits/bakery items, 30% off nearly expired meat, cheap lunch counter and now you have a points card? Provigo, you treat me too well :) only downside is that some stores have different selections and this store never has the vegetarian chilli or the pho rice noodles that I look to buy which means I always have to stop at a second store.
3	The closest grocery store to my place. I love that it's open to till 1 am. This allows me to grab something to eat at pretty much any time I want. The prices aren't that bad. It's not the biggest, but no grocery store in the city really is.To be honest, it's overshadowed by the nearby Adonis on the high end side of things and PA marche for the prices. It does fulfill it's purpose though!
2	I have to come here sometimes to get things they dont have at the fruit and veggie place right beside here (PA) and I'm always so disappointed. I've been frequenting this place since 2010 and I've disliked it ever since. Everything is over priced. You'd have better luck going to a dep and buying groceries there than coming here. Ok, thats a but dramatic but seriously, you're right downtown. People need food and this location barely has anything. The more common fruits and veggies (sometimes they don't even have those). A couple brands of milk, cereal, chicken, cheese and so on.Yes, the place is smaller than an average provigo, but come on! we need to eat! Its also mostly student around here as well, get on that! We are tired of just eating your (expensive) ramen!
