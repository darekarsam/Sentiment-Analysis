5	Had my car painted here and they did an excellent job! It looks beautiful, plus I got an awesome deal. Definitely recommend this place.
5	Greg @ Sakura rolled the Fenders on my Golf R. His customer service is top notch. Answered all my questions. The finished product was exactly what I needed. I will definetely recommend him to others.
1	I have no idea of the quality of work. I was blown off repeatedly. They must be busy so good for them. I just got tired of hearing they would have time for me next week. Every time next week would come they would be too busy for me. After 2 months of this I gave up. I feel dumb for even giving them that long.
