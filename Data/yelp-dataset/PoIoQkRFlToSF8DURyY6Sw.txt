4	12/12/14 just went here for the first time and its a new location.Very clean and 60's style  decor.......you'll swear you're on the set of Mad Men !!I had eggs, hashbrowns, bacon with 2 cinnamon pancakes for 7.49Very well prepared and my fiances chix fried steak was great. Flatscreen tvs hanging as well. I'll be going back.
1	Do yourself a favor, drive right by this place, turn east on baseline, and drive until you get to Black Bear Diner on the south side of the street. Bad food, bad service.
3	Very dirty, only had a handful of people working. Our server was really nice, the food was just okay.
1	Worse service ever!!!!!! Don't bother with this Village Inn. The management is awful. There are too many other Village Inn's in the area to deal with the poor service. The one on Power & Ray is a better option.
2	Went here just to get a slice of peppermint pie since a friend posted a picture of it on facebook.The service was super friendly and fast.  The pie was just okay though, I was really disappointed as I was looking forward to it.  Two slices of pie were small (though very rich) and the price was crazy expensive for to-go.  I believe $4.50 per small slice?I can't imagine I would ever go back...
