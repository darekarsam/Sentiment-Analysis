5	Clarissa Boutique is great.  The women at the store helped me pick out a beautiful crystal necklace & earrings to go along with my lace wedding dress.   On my wedding day, I received so many compliments on the necklace.  There is such a huge range of prices at the store.... high end jewelry and not  as high end jewelry.   My adorable drop crystal earrings were only $15.  My crystal necklace designed by jewelry company Haute Bride was a bit more (approx $200 but very reasonable for a crystal necklace).  I didnt have to spend as much... as there were other  necklaces less than $100 and even less than $50 but I absolutely loved the necklace I chose.The women at the boutique were very sweet and patient. The boutique also has a great selection of hairpieces, veils, jewelry for bridal party, and wedding accessories (ring bearer pillows, flower girls baskets, etc.)
5	I was referred to Clarissa Boutique by a friend. The ladies were pleasant and helped me pick out perfect earrings and bracelet to match my dress and crystals on the neckline. The prices were very reasonable. They even sent me a handwritten thank-you note in the mail. I will definitely refer friends!
