5	I love this Sport Clips!  Once a loyal customer to the other not-so-great Clip company, (after a bad cut experience) I have switched and not looked back since.  I was never keen on spending this kind of money for a haircut, because I consider my choice of cut to be simple - but the saying is usually true: "You get what you pay for!"I would prefer to just hear music and not sports while getting trimmed as I am not a stick and ball sports fan. But, they always have the four lettered sports channel cranked up to go along with the sporting related designed interior.It is worth the extra dead presidents to visit the back room for the hair washing and scalp massaging portion of the visit.  Talk about titillating!  Wow, very relaxing.The good lookin' group of ladies they have assembled is, for the most part, always friendly, helpful and professional.Get clipped today!
