1	DO NOT GO HERE... A THIEF WORKS HERE.  I went in for a normal haircut and when I went to pay, Anna, the hairdresser informed me she would not take my $100 bill.  That is all I had on me so I left her with my ID and a $100 bill so that she didnt think I was running out.  I broke my large bill next door and came back within 5 minutes.  She told me I never gave her any money and tht I still had to pay for the haircut... I called the cops while she called her manager who told me over the phone that "no one steals money that works for her".  And the police told me I could take her to civil court....  I learned a lot today.... Anna from supercuts is a theif and the police don't help citizens....I'm hoping karma will take care of Anna in the best way possible.  P.s there was no sign stating they don't take larger bills. This is the super cuts at 135 nellis, next to petsmart.

5	I've been going to this Supercuts for a few months and Yanet is by far the best hair stylist there. Very friendly and sweet, and she does an amazing job. I always get a combover/slicked back kind of style and she is always amazing. If you ever go to this Supercuts request her and you'll be so glad you did!
1	DONT GO HERE.... I went here today with my boyfriend  they first of all didnt tell us to sign in... So they called my boyfriend he got his haircut then they just complete skipped me. Two people went before me and I was there first so when they proceeded to call other people I became furious and the black employee got a nastey ass attitude with me... It was such a horrible experience  never again will I be coming here nor do I recommend anyone to come to this place
