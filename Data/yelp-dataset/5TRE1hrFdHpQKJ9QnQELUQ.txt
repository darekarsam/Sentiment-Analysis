4	I almost live here. I pass by Dollarama all the time to see what new things they get. Where else can I get a 1.5L bottle of Tresseme shampoo for 2$. I see nothing wrong with spending less for the same article that I would usually pay 4times the amount somewhere else.
3	Ok when I want cheap candy and want lots I come here for 1 $ I get 2 chocolate bars, or huge selection of gummy candies! The only ick I have here is the cashiers are slow and like to chit chat, and don't give back the correct change.
3	A dollarama amongst many.  What I like about this place is that the cashiers are always plenty, so I don't have to wait in any ridiculous lines before leaving.
