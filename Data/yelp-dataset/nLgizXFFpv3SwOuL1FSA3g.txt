4	Good comfortable place to get a haircut. Tv's, PS, and a pool table to past the time while you wait for a great haircut. Easy group of people to talk to. It was my first time here and won't be the last. Hector gave me a great haircut and shave for an affordable price.
5	This barber shop is up & coming in Surprise, AZ. I really appreciate the "common courtesy" as they do their job very well. And the cost is EXCEPTIONALLY LOW for what you get groomed up for !!! Lee is very professional, as well as his clergy ! They not only have a pool table, but I hear they will soon be having a chess table as well (in which I HAVE NOT SEEN in a barber shop in the West Coast as of yet, only in the East Coast). Even Theresa, a female barber and stylist, is very good and holds her own with her skills in this shop ! I do think other barber shops in Surprise are overrated, and the waiting is extremely long as well... But not in Executive Cuts... They are on the $$$ ! Thanks again... And I will spread the word (for word of mouth is the best advertisement anyway).  !
1	My son walked into this barber shop, no one bothered to greet or acknowledge him. They looked at him after already being in there for five minutes and told him to sign in. Not welcoming, terrible customer service.
5	Executive Cuts is the premier Mens Barbershop in Surprise and the surrounding area! Very PROFFESIONAL and attention to detail is absolutely AMAZING! Joining there staff is the only woman Barber in the area, (Suzette Monique) call or stop in and ask for her.
1	Horrible experience for my young boys. I don't know the guys name but he was so rude, intimidating and threatened my middle son under his breath so I couldn't hear but my older son could. Had my boys in tears. So unprofessional and uncalled for. You don't treat paying customers like that. We have three boys plus my husband and tip well. Glad to take our business elsewhere.
