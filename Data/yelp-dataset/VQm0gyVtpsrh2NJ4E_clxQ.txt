5	Went to check out the all new fabulous Tropicana this past Monday and found this place. Decided to stop in and try out one of their frozen cocktails and to watch the Chargers MNF game. Andrea gave me a couple samples to try and I chose one. One drink led to another and by the end of the night I tried about every Mango combination I could think of! Double shots and discounted refills made the night! I had such a great time I decided to come again the next night for Andrea's beautiful friendly service and of those tasty drinks!  We were chillin and the chill'm. :)
2	Not great people to work for... however i'll still give them 2 stars for the fact that the products are top of the line for a slush bar. And you can mix flavors and customize the liquor that goes in because they all start out virgins :)
