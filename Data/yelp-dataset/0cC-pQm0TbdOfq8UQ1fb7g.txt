4	This little DD shares space inside a gas station, but the location is clean and convenient.  Only a 5 minute drive from my house, this is the quickest and best stop for a coffee on the go.  If you're in a hurry they have a drive-thru, but if you like to browse the selection of donuts (like me) they have easy parking so you can run in.Their food is standard fast food breakfast fare (and most people are already familiar with DD), but their coffee is quite tasty.  Also I'm a big fan of their donuts and I would rank them much higher than Krispy Kreme.The employees at this location are mostly friendly and efficient.  If you like to doctor up your own coffee you'll have to ask for your cream and splenda since they don't have any sitting out with the sugar, napkins, and straws.This is my go to quick coffee stop in Belmont.
1	I Love-Love-Love DD"s but this one does not compare to all others.  I don't know what is with their creamer.  It tastes sour.  I have tried a few times but the coffee always seems off.  I drive to the one on New Hope even though I live closest to this one.
4	I've had mostly great experiences with this DD. For a gas station add-on business, it's very well run and the employees are pretty friendly.Don't shy away if you're in need of a coffee fix. They'll hook you up!
