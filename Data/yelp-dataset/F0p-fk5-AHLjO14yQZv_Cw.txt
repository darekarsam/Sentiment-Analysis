5	Great prices, great locations, and helpful employees. I am a fan!
4	This walgreens is a new location to the Santan Valley area and is always clean, fully stocked and the employees are always friendly.
1	Worst pharmacy ever! They are slow as molasses and they tell me every time they are short staffed! If prescriptions are ready for pickup why does it take over 20 minutes every single time to get my single prescription. I'm a very patient person, but this makes me want to go postal! Go somewhere else and save yourself the time!!!
1	I strongly dislike their pharmacy they are extremely slow extremely disrespectful to everybody like today on Christmas Eve I simply called for questions about my sons medication I have no idea what their hours are but the pharmacy tech answer the phone and she transferred me to the lady that can answer my question I was on hold for 20 minutes and no answer I hung up the phone and called back again and they answered one more time and they told me that they are not open till 9 o'clock but they never said that to me in the beginning this is a perfect example on why you should not use their pharmacy they lack on communication and respect
