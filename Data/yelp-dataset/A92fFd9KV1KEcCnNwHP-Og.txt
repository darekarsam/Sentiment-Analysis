4	Modernized, unpretentious and delicious bistro menu and very reasonable prices. Montreal is undoubtedly a "foodie" city, but for many years was literally in island in the surrounding culinary wasteland. That seems to be changing, notably in Laval, and L'Aromate is a wonderful example. On several visits (yes it is that good) I was struck by the quality of the ingredients, simplicity of presentation, emphasis on natural flavors and the charming (young) staff. Standouts included a "torchon de foie gras de canard" which was essentially a meal in itself, a smoked-chicken Cesar salad, and a fantastic salmon tartare (3 flavors). Accompanied by a judicious selection of your own wines and L'Aromate can deliver a memorable experience at a substantial discount over the downtown restos - highly recommended
1	avoid this place...  their chef should take a cooking class.. very poor quality.. small portions. It's expensive and you don't get the food quality for the price they want you to pay.. AVOID it..
4	Have been going there with my wife since it opened. Fortunately we have been lucky with quality and service every time we ate there. Summertime you can seat outside and it is very cosy.
2	First time over there. The patio was very nice and I was with a friend that I have not seen for years. I was expecting so much from this place and I was disappointed. The food was ok but I was expecting much more from this place. First and last time ... Too many good restaurants to waste money at this one .
