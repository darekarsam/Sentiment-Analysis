5	I love TEAM 4 Kids! The staff is absolutely amazing and my son has made definite progress. He is never scared to go back and work with his therapists and I can honestly say that we feel welcome and cared about here. I am so happy that we found TEAM 4 Kids and I recommend TEAM 4 Kids to anyone who is in need of services for their children.
