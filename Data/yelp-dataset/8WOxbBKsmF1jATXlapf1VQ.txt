5	Vivian is very good, friendly and professional. Love going to this salon.
5	Great nail salon! Very friendly! They suggested upgrades but weren't pushy when I said I couldn't afford the pedicure this week; just encouraged me to come back next week. I got a gel manicure...they took their time and were very precise with their work. Moderate selection of gel colors, more than just pinks at other salons! Fair pricing + good work = 2nd visit! Will definitely go back to KV!
5	I was trying to find a new place and I wasn't sure about new places. So I decided to go to this place because I remember seeing the sign on the street in the past. Great decision. I walked in asked about prices they helped a lot, and even found me best way to get what I wanted and save money. My 6 year old daughter was with me and they even did her fingers and toes. They were really sweet to her. They care about what you want and your needs. Great service! Amazing massage! Great!!
5	I really enjoyed my time here. The ladies were super nice and attentive. Tammy did my nails and she did a great job. I had my 4 year old in tow and they were good to her even though I know she can be a bit much with her 101 questions. Definitely will come back once I grow my own nails because I really don't like the fake ones. :)
