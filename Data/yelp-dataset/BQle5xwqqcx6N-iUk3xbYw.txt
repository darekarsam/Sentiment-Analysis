5	I came here on a recommendation from my Dr. as I was having foot and ankle problems.  Dr. Lam was very courteous and asked many questions which made me feel like he was getting to know me and my problem.After 5 of the 10 scheduled visits I was felling well enough to walk and by the time we finished I was back to playing volleyball full speed.
5	I am 6' 2" 245lbs and hate needles I was in a bad car accident about a year and recieved a torn shoulder and back issues with hematomas on my tailbone that really scared me.The Doc said he could help me and I decided to give it a "shot" LOL! well in four treatments the hematomas are almost gone! My back pain is almost gone I realize it's not going to repair torn tissues but boy it sure helps the pain! Thank you Doc!!
5	I started going to Meridian Wellness right before the Nevada Bar Exam. Someone had recommended acupuncture for nerves and concentration. I was not 100% certain it would do anything but I thought it couldn't hurt since the bar exam was going to be the most important exam of my life. Dr. Lam treated me the day before the exam. The next day, I had absolutely no anxiety. I sat down and just went to work on the exam. I passed the bar exam. I attribute my success to lots of studying and the clear head that acupuncture gave me. Dr. Lam was awesome, too. He is a down to earth guy, and you can tell he really cares. I still do acupuncture because it helps with my day-to-day stress management and retention. I often recommend Dr. Lam to my friends.
5	This place is hidden behind sushi fever, but the best place I've gone to get adjusted, acupuncture, and massage all in one place! I've been a patient here for almost a year now and all I have to say is Dr. Lam is a wonderful doctor. Staff is friendly and office is nice and clean kept.
