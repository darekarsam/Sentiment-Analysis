4	How do you rate an adult superstore?  What do you compare it to?  These stores have set my expectations sooooooo high that whenever I wander into an adult store in another city, I always laugh at how pitiful they are.  Tiny selections that are seriously overpriced.  Not so with AS.  There are several of these in the valley, and I find them to be pretty consistent.  These kind of feel like the wal-mart of adult stores.   Nice, organized aisles filled with merch for him, her and everyone in between.   There's nothing particularly "seductive" about shopping here, its very professional.  And certainly no reason to be embarrassed...the products are easy to find, well packaged/labelled and clearly priced.   The center rows are stocked with videos (can't speak for the selection) while the perimeter has gadgets, devices, toys and lubes of every make, model, size, color and flavor.   And this location has possibly the largest selection of "battery-operated happiness" I've ever seen...including this whole new wave of expensive, discreet, ergonomically designed products that have finally hit the market.  There is an upstairs I believe, but I'm not sure what's up there...I think lingerie maybe. These kinds of products are usually waaaaay cheaper to buy online, but AS is competitively priced...and going to these stores gives you the chance to explore.   And the staff will open boxes and check that the items work properly. This particular clerk was a helpful, non-judgmental elderly lady.And most importantly, there were NO creepy pervs loitering around.   Just regular people and couples buying things and keeping it moving.  All in all....the least awkward this kind of shopping experience could possibly be!
