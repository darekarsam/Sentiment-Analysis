3	Solid Latin grocer, bakery, and cafeteria-style restaurant on a cuteish corner of Belanger near St.Denis. It feels cozy and packed with families, a little crazy extra ram-packed sometimes, so careful weekend afternoon shopping here if you're a little claustrophobic. You can get products here from 20 South and Central American countries - mostly canned and packaged goods. The food in the restaurant is tasty and a-ok if you're not afraid of buffet.
5	Sabor Latino has been a haven for me! I'm Mexican American, from East LA and I love cooking/ eating my favorite comfort foods! Although this place doesn't carry everything (like Peruvian beans) they provide me with pan dulce, Pasilla chilies for chili rellenos, takis, chili candies and corn tortillas! At a good price for being imported products too! Without this place I wouldn't be able to cook half of my grandmothers recipes. The food they prepare and serve there is tasty too. Not only Mexican, Central and South American also. Me and my boyfriend like to do our shopping here, and grab a taco plate :)
5	unbelievably delicious food. so flavorful and generous with the guacamole. the Tamals and Arepas are to die for, and the churros are the perfect finish. friendly service, nice fresh juices, and great selection of Latin groceries.  5 stars for this place.
