5	Stopped in for a quick beer last week with some friends on our way back from dinner, and to my surprise the bartender was beyond excellent, being my first time here I was interested in all the beers. She knew all the little tings and tangs about the various beers, she even game me a mini tasting to I could try, I had a citrusbomb, it was out of this world. Citrus hops, clean crisp finish, made me say wow out loud. Can't wait to return for a full flight!
1	NO VAPE, EVEN OUTSIDE !I am no "power vaper", I just enjoy a little nicotine with my after work beverage.  Pretty good Belgian tripel, really bad policy decision.  We won't be back.
3	Restaurants on Madison's west side are booming.  Sprechers was actually are third stop after 2 other places had waits of 30 and 60 minutes on a Thursday night.My gf and I both really enjoyed our salads (see pic).  I gave the hard root beer a try since I love the regular stuff, but I wont be drinking that again.  It was way to sweet.Service was fine.  Our waitress was being trained in...I think her trainer could have backed off a little bit...All in all an enjoyable experience at this location which once housed Hulahans, rated Madison's dirtiest restaurant.
