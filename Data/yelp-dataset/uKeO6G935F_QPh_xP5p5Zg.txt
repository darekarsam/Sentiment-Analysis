5	Have been going here for over four years. They've changed management since I started going but the core staff remains the same. Lisa is my go to gal for waxing and manicure. Aloha is clean, they get the job done (my nails up to two weeks), have AWESOME pedicure chairs, offer complimentary wine (albeit a generic Chard or Cab Sauvignon) and bottled water, have a decent-sized flat-screen tv with no less than a thousand channels, and has a fun mix of customers (I've chatted up guys and gals of all ages and colors while getting my toes freshened up). Make no mistake - it is no Aveda or Modern or other high-end, high-brow, expensive place but it is cozy, cheap, and convenient. Aloha!

You can have water or wine while getting your nails done! I believe they also have waxing services. They don't have a large selection of nail colors, so if you have some fave colors you may want to bring a bottle or two. They accept walk-ins, although they have only two nail stations and I think four pedi chairs. If you happen to catch them during a busy spell, you may have to wait 20-30 minutes.

I don't know how they do it but my pedis last up to 6 weeks. The ladies are so nice and the massage chairs are great. The price is right and the leg and hand massages are fantastic!
