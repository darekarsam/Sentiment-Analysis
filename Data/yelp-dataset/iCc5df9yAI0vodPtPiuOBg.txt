4	Chambers Grill is located inside the The Crown Plaza in Downtown Charlotte.           I have eaten here several times and gotten things to go as well. My very favorite things are the hot wings and the French onion soup.All my friends that eat here also are very impressed with what they have ordered. You can eat at the bar or at a dining table. There is always quite a few people in here.However, the service is always fast and very pleasant.   It could definitely use a make over and brighten it up a bit though.  The prices are quite a bit high as well. No doubt because, it is in a hotel.  Paid parking , unless you have to park somewhere else and walk down.   If you stay at the hotel, this is a good place to eat though.

5	I love this place! The Fried Chicken thursdays are not to be missed.  They have  a great lunch buffet during the weekend and I can't say enough about the Mac and Cheese!
3	Stumbled upon this place while working a tournament in Charlotte. My co-worker and I were in search for some alcohol haha and a snack. We came in around 2:30ish and sat at the bar area; my co-worker ordered a beer and I ordered a frozen drink. My co-worker received her drink, but I was informed that the manager would come make my drink because the bartender doesn't come until 3:30. I was cool with that, but the manager never came over and I was told that the blender was broken. What a coinky-dink! So I decided just to have a water; hold the alcohol. I also ordered the fried chicken special which comes with greens and macaroni and cheese. The chicken was pretty good; not the best that I've had, but pretty good nonetheless. The greens were simple; could have used seasoning and the macaroni and cheese was blah. The chicken and water were the best thing I ordered. I didn't get the alcohol I wanted lol. The service was fast. The server was...okay. There's a nice dining area, but we sat at the bar which had a television.
