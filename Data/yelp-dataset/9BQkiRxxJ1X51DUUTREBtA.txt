5	Love this location! Very clean & the employees are polite & very helpful. They have everything you could possibly need in a smoke shop. The prices are affordable as well.
1	My experience is not unlike those of a couple of customers at the DJ's store on Southern, so perhaps there's cross-over between the staff.The snotty chick sitting on the sofa dissing the customers was a definite turn-off.  On my last visit, I stopped abruptly and asked the guy working there what she had said, because it was overtly rude even just based on the bored "I don't care" tone.  Maybe that BS works well if you're hanging out at the campus, too cool for the freshman boys, but here - not so much.  After completing my purchase, and not being thanked, as I was walking away, sure enough, the young "lady" called after me with a monotone and insincere "Thanks".  (She may've simply been the girlfriend of the guy working here, but she was behind the counter, so...  Hell, maybe daddy is the manager of this store - that might explain the childish 'tude.)Anyhow, suffice it to say that I'm unimpressed with this head shop, and I vote with my dollars.  Perhaps if these people grow up, they'll, um, grow up.  Meanwhile, there are friendly people at numerous cigars shops only blocks away, and I enjoyed doing business with them.  You will too.
