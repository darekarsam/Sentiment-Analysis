5	HisshoSushi's "Blazing California Roll" has distinctive flavors priced under $8. I was so impressed that reading the ingredients became an imperative (after my dinner/snack). That paprika-mayo-sesame seed combo was a winning choice for pollack, avocado and rice. Seductive flavors with depth should be sinful, especially at the airport. If you're flying through Charlotte, North Carolina the CarryOn Sushi Counter is a great idea. Healthy. Quick. Flavorful.
3	Very expensive for sub-par sushi.
1	My friend and I BOTH got sick on the sushi - they claim is fresh but they switch the expiration stickers on the packages.  Stay away.  We only ate there because we needed something gluten free.  The overpriced sushi had BAD AVOCADO and served to customers.
1	Man I wish I would have these reviews prior to ordering. The worst sushi ever! Granola bar here I come. Gagging.
