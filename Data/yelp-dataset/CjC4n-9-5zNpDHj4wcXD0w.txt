4	Great new location in the Pavilions.  The bar is 21 and up only so you don't have to watch your P's and Q's so much (big fan of this).  Decent beer selection.   What made it was the bartender (sorry man, your name slips my mind).  But you had all batman bartending gear, which was awesome.  He was friendly, knowledgeable,  and fast service.  Will definitely be back.  This is one of the better RR locations.
4	Super nice location, very nicely decorated, as compared to other locations that seem overly cluttered. Food was good, service was excellent, great experience overall. When you are super hungry for a burger, this is the place to be. Added bonus, we were here on a Saturday, and there were plenty of TV's for watching football games. I really wouldn't think of going here to crack back a few brews and watch a game, but I would NOW!
