3	Ghetto Ghetto Ghetto!!! The only reason I come here because they have an extensive selection of African American hair care products at a reasonable price. You can get everything here from Top of the line weave to dreadlock products. The service pretty much sucks, but I again I don't come here for that I come so I can have decent looking hair. If you are looking for wigs you will have to go next door to their sister store "Wig Land".
2	Rude and too much clutter!! Don't have any prices on braiding hair packages.  They charge a different price for braiding hair every time I shop here. I'm done! No more!
3	Wide variety of selections of hair care products, extensions and wigs. Everything is neatly organized with pricing listed. Don't plan on being helped but I can say you are greeted.
