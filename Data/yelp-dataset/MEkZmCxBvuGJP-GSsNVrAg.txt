5	Okay, Melanie is by far the best person I've ever been to for any injections! & I have been to quite a few! I get so many compliments all the time about my lips. I love her! I even drive all the way across town just to see her. Its worth it for sure. I've seen girls that have really bad lip injections and it gets all bumpy.. Not with Melanie. She makes sure to smooth them out & make the perfect. I recommend everyone to go to her. & she has the best prices. Everywhere else is like $100- $300 more then her. I would give her a 10/10 score.
5	Melanie is very serious about what she does.  That makes me trust her. Her technique is flawless hence the name of her company!  Highly intelligent, fab bedside manor and beautiful person.  I would  never let anyone else touch my face!  Love love love her!!!
5	I've known Melanie for a few years and SHE IS AWESOME!!!!  I witness many times the results on her patients until one day I decided to trust her and best thing I ever did. The real truth is that no one knows that I use fillers except for Melanie.She is so good applying fillers that is hard for others to notice it. Also, she is very reasonable in price and will always take good care of you assuring your loyal return and satisfaction.I love that about her! Hard to find that same treat somewhere else here in Las Vegas.I definitely recommend her!!!!!!
5	Melanie just did my lips on the 26th, one syringe of Restalyne. She is awesome!!! Her injection technique is incredible because I did not feel a thing and my lips look amazing. I can't wait to go back for more lip fillers and eventually some Botox! Seriously, schedule an appointment with her, you won't be sorry.
5	Went to see Melanie for first time. It was amazing. I got lip injections and Botox. Cheaper than I thought it would be and walked out with feeling and looking 10 years younger. Thank you, melanie
5	Thorough with her answers to my questions and very gentle with the process. Great results!
