4	Great atmosphere on a game night, and the food is good.  I'm not a beer drinker, so I can't comment on that, but the place was packed to watch the Habs and everyone seemed to be having a good time.
2	I had read that this was one of the best burgers in the area. If a heavily compacted, frozen, overcooked patty is included in the best burger list then I guess I could see it as great!This was a very very over-rated burger! I seek out great burgers everywhere I go, and this wasn't even close! Do yourself a favour and try somewhere else. Anywhere! Try McDonalds for all I care, as it wouldn't be worse!!! 2 stars for the pleasant bartender. Otherwise this is a zero.
