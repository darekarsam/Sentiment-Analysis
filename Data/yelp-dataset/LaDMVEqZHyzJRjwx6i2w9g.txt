1	If I could give no stars, I would.  This location is HORRIBLE!  We ordered Doritos locos tacos, nachos bell grande and chalupas.  It took 10 minutes to get our dine in order and it wasn't even rush hour.  The employees were in the back joking around while we waited for our food.  When we got our food, the employee attempted to put it on a DIRTY tray and I had to specifically ask for a clean one.  I got an eye roll for that.  Then, instead of receiving cool ranch Doritos tacos, I received regular.  I decided since it took so long, I would just eat them anyways.  The nachos bell grande only had cheese and sour cream.  Rather then take it back, I asked if I could just have some tomatoes to put on it myself.  As well as the side of guac THAT I HAD ORDERED.  I got another eye roll, and the employee proceeded to tell his coworker that it was ridiculous that I was asking for tomatoes and guac.  It doesn't end there.  ALL the tables were dirty, I had to clean one myself.  The floors were disgusting and the soda machine looked like it had never been wiped down.  On top of it all, when we left, the employees were right outside the front door smoking and cracking jokes while people were inside waiting for their orders.  There is a reason people don't frequent the south side for food.  Places like this just make your stomach turn.  Bravo Taco Bell for outstanding customer service.
5	Great taco bell, staff is very friendly and I've never had any wrong orders any of the times I've been here.
5	Why am I reviewing a taco bell? I've been bar hopping and have to get up for work in 6 hours. Bless you 24hr taco bell, where else can you order the whole right side of menu for $10???? Tonite I salute the brave workers dealing with drunks and those getting their munchies on, BRAVO
