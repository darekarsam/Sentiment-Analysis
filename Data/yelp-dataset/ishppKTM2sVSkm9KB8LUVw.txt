5	Everything is so delicious! The cakes are the best! Original flavors and decorations. Definitely coming back !
5	My cousin told me about this place.. she actually brought one of their cakes over to a party we were having and when I had a slice of it... it was to die for. It was so delicious that I had to go back and get my own cake. Haha. Flavors are on point and amazing.  I surely do recommend this bakery.
5	Best cakes & pastries... They did a cake for a bachlorette party I threw and it was so good. It was the 4 in 1 awesome!!!! I live in  centennial hills and come all the to Jones and Lake mead for Vegas Bakery anytime.. Prices are good for the great quality of cakes..
4	First off, I'm not a big fan of bakeries. I know, weird right?? When it comes to desserts I'm of the extremely simple type. Maybe a hostess cupcake or some such thing. Seriously though, I came because I was looking for a special treat for my gf who is from Mexico. She has been saying that there aren't any great places to get authentic desserts here in Vegas like tres leches and mil ojas cakes. So, Vegas bakery came up on Yelp and I figured I'd give it a try. I have been there 3 times now trying different things and I would have to say the tres leches is my favorite. I didn't really care for the mil ojas and as for my gf, well, she's pretty tough! She thought it was ok which is better than most I guess thus the 4 stars. I'll have to compare if I find some other places in town.
