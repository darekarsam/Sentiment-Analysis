4	Ok, I'm going to stick my neck out a bit here and make a rather bold claim. So forgive, you may have experienced better. I mean, you haven't, but you may think you have. So here goes. This place does, without doubt, the best bacon roll in Edinburgh. I mean that. Heaps of tasty, crispy bacon (but not overly crispy, just nicely crispy) on a roll that wasn't too floury but perfectly soft.Outside this places looks really welcoming. They've gone for the whole French patisserie look, and it works because it's on a leafy little street in Brunstfield. It's simple, but effective. Coffee was alright, not great, but drinkable all the same. My friends both had paninis - a pesto, mozzarella and sun blushed tomato one, and a sort of meat ball sub (which was amazing). The only thing to watch is the sit in prices are nearly double the take out prices. I'm not sure why. Tax reasons perhaps? Anyway, the bacon roll was worth at least a tenner.

3	The coffee is cheaper than it's Costa neighbour, the sandwiches are plentiful and inexpensive, but theres a few things that keep it from being extra special. 1. The mass amount of school children who raid the place at several hours of the day (why are they never studying?) 2. Sometimes don't have all the ingredients you want (I seem to try to order smoked salmon sandwich 3 times but they never have it!) 3. Not a lot of seatingIt's alright to pick up coffee, id take it over costa. 1.85 for a coffee to go. Not bad!
