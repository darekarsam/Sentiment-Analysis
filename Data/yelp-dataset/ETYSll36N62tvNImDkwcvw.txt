5	I contacted Darryn via e-mail after reading so many fantastic reviews on-line.  He always responded promptly to my messages and was a true professional every step of the way.  Unfortunately, Darryn was very sick with bronchitis the day of the move but that didn't prevent him from showing up on time and doing a fantastic job.  I'm glad I listened to all the great reviews and decided to contact him.  I highly recommend Darryn and now know who I will be calling for my next move.
5	We used ABC Small Moving Specialists to pick up and then deliver a leather couch/love seat and a large treadmill. We spoke directly with Daryn to make plans--he was quick to return calls and made plans quickly for us. I appreciate his know how and on time work he did for us. Highly recommend.  Thank you.
5	We used Daryn to pick-up and delivery a 5 large box dining room set from Costco.  He called used the night before to confirm our meeting time at Costco and was promptly there as promised.  For a reasonable extra fee, he and his team unboxed and assembled the furniture.  I recommend using Small Move Specialists for delivering those large Costco items you can't get home on your own.
