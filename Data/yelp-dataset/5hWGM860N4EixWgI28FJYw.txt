5	This is one of my favorite coffee place downtown. I especially like the second floor where there are different sizes of table mixed with the more comfortable and cozy sofa areas. Thanks to the huge windows covering the entire side of the building, you will have natural sunlight almost anywhere you will be sitting. This will be especially appreciated by people working for long hours. There are many power outlets and the WiFi signal quality is excellent, even when the place is crowded. The food and coffee is standard Java U, which is better than most, and the service is always on point. Will go again!
