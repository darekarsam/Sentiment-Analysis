5	One of my favorite wing spots just opened near my favorite library.   I am always in need of a great and awesome location to pick up food when I am headed to the library to read/study.   This place just happens to be my all time favorite. Brand spanking new with my favorite lemon pepper wings and hand cut fries.   Order online or with the app.   Could life be any better?   I think not.
3	New location!  Tonight included a 10 piece Classic Combo.  5 Garlic Parmesan and 5 Original Hot wings, fresh made French fries and Blue cheese dressing.  Service was good from this new staff.The inside and kitchen were spotless.Everything tasted good and as you would expect from any other WingStop location.
5	I was my late night dinner. The service was great and friendly.
5	They forgot my ranch but the manager took care of it and I really appreciated it. I went back to order more and the services are great!
2	Such a disappointment after I've heard this place is good- wings tasted ok but were really little. The fries have something like a sugar salt on it and it gets really gross after just a few bites. Mine were also drenched in this mystery coating so you didn't even know you were eating fries. The roll also had a very sweet taste to it. I lost my appetite after the second bite of each item. Veggies were the only good part of this meal and those are hard to mess up. I won't be going back, that's for sure!
