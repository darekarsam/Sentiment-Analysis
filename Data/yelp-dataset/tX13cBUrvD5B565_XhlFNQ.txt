3	Average Sushi Shop. Generally everything is pretty fresh. Take out lunch combos are a pretty good deal between $7-12. Nothing fancy and not what you would call "authentic" but reasonable for a quick lunch.
1	Sushi shop is good. But seriously. This location ? Never againI asked for two sushi rolls. Two employees. One customer. They kept talking and talking and talking, taking ages to make two stupid rolls as I was just sitting there in front of them, not wondering one second if maybe they should stop talking and start actually making the rolls. 20mn later (not kidding) I had the rolls. FinafuckingllyMaybe too angry to enjoy them, and it takes a lot to make me angry, but seriously. Do your fucking job
