4	Ok spicy actually really means spicy here! For those who are looking for the mecca  Pakistanese and Indian of take-out restaurants in Montreal, look no further. Open 7 days a week until 11:00pm every day, you can find an elaborate variety of 17 types of curries, 7 different types of balti, 10 types of biryani, 14 assorted vegetarian dishes, 10 Pakistani naans and the list goes on. Personal favorites are the lamb vindaloo, chicken bhuna, shrimp jalfrazi, bhindi and dal channa. Ask for different levels of spice to get a feel for the difference - you won;t regret it!
3	Food is excellent but not professional.  i complemented the cook he wasn't friendly. I usually take out. I don't like that ambience..Biriany Not meaty enough n  portion became smaller. I find it pricy.
