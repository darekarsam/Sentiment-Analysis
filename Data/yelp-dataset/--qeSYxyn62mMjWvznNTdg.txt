4	Yesterday I ate at Panda Express Casa Grande. Its been a while and I am suprised that the foods cooked better and perfectly great. It was exactly the same experienced that I had in Panda Express Maricopa! Great stuff for lunch!!!!
3	Fast food that is some type of asian food that has tons of HFCS (corn sugar) if you plan on eating here more than once fill out the survey on reciept so you can get a free item since this place can get a lil expensive. The food is decent but I cant eat it all the time, nor should you.....it is incredibly bad for you!
4	Who doesn't like "crappy mall food".  Great tasting, relatively cheap, and quick.  Buffet style.  Variety of soft drinks and bottled drinks.  Kitchen staff is really good, but there are times with staff turnovers and overflowing trash cans or tables that needed wiping down 1/2 hour ago.  It happens frequently with a large rush that last longer than normal crowds.  High turnover rate on people.  I minus a star because sometimes they forget to add my utensils in my to-go bag.
4	Fast quick and reliable for people in a hurry. Got the new honey sesame chicken and mushroom chicken. Good however the tables need to be wiped down more frequently. Staff is courteous and nice and was greeted with smiles!
