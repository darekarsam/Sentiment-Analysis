4	One of my go to places for gas, it's usually the cheapest in my neighborhood.It gets really crowded sometimes but the wait usually isn't too bad. The staff inside the store are always friendly. There are pay stations at the gas pumps whether your paying cash, credit, or debit; you can use these...which is convenient if you don't want to go in the store.  We've used the connected car wash a few times and they do a pretty good job.
5	Pretty cheap gas. They even have a pay phone & a Chase ATM inside.  Car wash is decently nice on some days but can also be a very long wait time (45 minutes). 35 cent fee when you use a debit/credit card bring cash!
4	Good service, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Decent selection and prices, though as is standard they don't have hot food ready during the late night periods.The gas is pretty much always cheaper than the Shell across the street, and I've heard great things about the car wash. Really, this is the place to stop for gas, or for anything you need when the grocery across Russell is closed for the day. I'll definitely be back.
