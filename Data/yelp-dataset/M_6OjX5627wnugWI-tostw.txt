5	I know nothing about AC except it keeps you alive in AZ come summer time. My AC stopped working when it was 110 ouside. I went onto Youtube to trouble shoot. The Capacitor was the probable cause. I called around and the only business that would sell me a repalcement was Discount AC. All the other places you must have an AC contractors licsence. The short drive was worth it. The owner was knowledgeable and friendly. He had my cap in stock. He took the time to explain exactly what I must do. We even talked about future possible problems and how to trouble shoot it should it be nessesary. Highly recommend place to do business with,
5	Knowledgeable and willing to help! They walked me through a DIY repair that saved me hundreds of dollars!
5	I called on a Sat at 5:30 ready to leave a message - a tech answers and, to my surprise, walks me thru some troubleshooting steps (my condenser fan wasn't running).  We narrow it down to two parts which I bought in to their shop the next day.  He tested the parts for me and sold me the proper replacement.   Super-helpful, very knowledgeable, lots of parts on hand - this company deserve your business!
5	This company did us right!  From the time we called Eddie to the time we picked up the item needed.  Customer service? You got it here.  Excellent trouble shooting? Absolutely, even gave us additional information we hadn't thought of. We will recommend this company to others.  They did us right the first time.
