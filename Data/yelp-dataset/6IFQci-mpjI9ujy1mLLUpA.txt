3	I go here for the tasty Zaxby's sauce which makes their average chicken really good.  I also like using their online ordering since sometimes the wait can be a little long for "fast" food. In my opinion, the wings are just decent and the fries are usually soggy.I would definitely choose Zaxby's over a trip to a Wendy's or Bojangles any day.
5	Never have any problems here...good food, good service.
1	Very poor customer service not to mention out of lemonade so wife had to drink water then she asked for a sauce pack and they tried charging her . Not the 1st time here that service was horrible waited a few weeks ago for over 20 min in drive thru because they gave our shakes to someone else in the dinning room ! The rudest one was  Alex says he's manager if so I feel sorry for this store not only the way he treated us but as we were eating hearing him talk down to the employees .
4	The food is consistently good and the zax sauce is awesome.The chicken tenders are kinda small but they make up with it in quantity and lots of sides. Also, the drive thru isn't the quickest.
5	I have Always had great food and great service. thank you zaxby's fort mill. Been there several times never disapointed . Can tell they put pride in there food and it's always clean
