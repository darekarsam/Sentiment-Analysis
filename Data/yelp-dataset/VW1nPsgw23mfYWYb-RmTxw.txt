2	This CVS location is below average. It is open 24 hours, but is oddly expensive on most items while cheap on unpurchased items like socks. Pens and pencils for example were oddly expensive. I got the cheapest quality umbrella of my life ( below those freebies you get at trade shows) for $17 here. Single cups of fruit cocktail are over $3. Physically this location has parking in a small lot. The store is pretty small square footage and I think is only worthwhile for those last night must have emergencies. There is a Rite Aid down Forbes towards the universities a little further that may be better.
3	This location is great in case of an emergency.  I needed to run in and buy an allergy medicine before I wasn't able to see.  It was great t run in, pick up what I needed and use the self check out counters and be on my way.As for what the other review says, prices are a bit steep for certain items in the store.  For items that you would expect to be every day items they seem to gouge you on.  But in a pinch, it'll do.  Oh, be sure to use the appropriate doors.
3	They sell plants at this store!
