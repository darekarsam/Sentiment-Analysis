4	Finally we found a great place for Fish & Chips on the South ShoreDecor is pretty average, but I rather pay for good food than nice furniture and on the later they delivered perfectly. The fish & chip is just amazing, we tried all 3 flavors and they were all good, the fish was moist and flavorful and the batter was crisp from start to end. Service was good and fast and the waitress was very friendly.We will definitely go back.

It would definitely be a place we'd go to if we lived in the area.The fish and chips looked really greasy.  However, the breading was thin and light.  The fish itself was super fresh and very light.  So good! We got the beer battered fish and the maple batter fish.  The maple batter one had a hint of sweetness which we wanted more of.  All in all, the meals we're very good and ones we'd love to get again.  We also picked up a cup of clam chowder.  It was incredibly tasty.Great place!
