5	Great variety of food on a daily basis. My co-workers and I stopped in for lunch and it was like finding a gold mine! The Prices were great ranging from $14-$17 and included a salad, main course, dessert and coffee. All the food is made fresh daily with each day having a different menu. How good is that?! I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting the area. Great Service too!
5	Super awesome place! Just as Sir Steven says - food is crazy good and cheap here. a $17 (canadian omg) daily prix fixe menu that changes depending on what's fresh. Some days you might have swordfish.. rabbit.. who knows? Service is excellent and it's a really nice little restaurant. I ended up eating here a lot for lunch when I worked at the hospital around the corner.
5	If you love port wine, then this is the place you've been looking for your whole life! They literally have a wall of port wine! Of all types, all ages, all brands and they sell it here by the glass. You can pay anywhere from $6 to $40 for a shot of port here, it depends on what you're looking for. The food here is excellent. Simple Portuguese fare done right, grilled sardines, seafood casserole, grilled lamb chops or pork chops, maybe rabbit. Zesty potatoes and salads, their soups are just as good. It's in the northern reaches of the gay village and a bit of a walk from the metro but I'm completely surprised not a lot of Montrealers know about this place given that it's been in business now for well over 10 years.
5	I LOVED this place!  Unfortunately, it is now closed and being replaced by a Poutineville.  You know, since this town needs yet another poutine place, instead of what was simply the best Portuguese food I have ever had in my life!
5	Bistro Porto is now closed and has been replaced by Poutineville. I wish I knew if they just relocated or what because this was my favorite Portuguese restaurant by far. :-(
