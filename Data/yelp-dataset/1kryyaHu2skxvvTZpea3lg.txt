1	I had horrible service here.  When I arrived there were 2 people ahead of me.  3 more people arrived after me and after all 5 others were taken before me and after an hour and a half I complained and was met with a blank stare and a comment "I don't know" so I left and went to a Urgent care in Tempe and was seen immediately.
1	I did the online check in and preregistered before coming in and showed up at my assigned time but that was a joke and a waste of time. I was told by the very rude front desk lady that they don't pay any attention to that option and was offended when I suggested somebody should remove that option from their website. Anyhow I sat down in the waiting room where there was two TV's turned on one of them was playing Spanish soap operas and was a pretty loud (apparently she wasnt going to miss her soap operas by being at work) and the other was English news but was muted. That was pretty annoying due to the fact the only people in the waiting room spoke English. While waiting a guy came in and was upset that he was given the wrong prescription. The rest of my visit was just as pleasant as the first part. They didn't have an actual doctor on site. They lack communication from one staff member to another is nonexistant. The physicians assistant doesnt take the time to listen and the diagnosis reflects such.
5	Came in with a friend who needed to be seen. Came during the week around 9am. We were seen within a half hour. Quick and painless. And they also have a program for un insured people which is awesome. Had to pay $135 out of pocket instead of the $200+
