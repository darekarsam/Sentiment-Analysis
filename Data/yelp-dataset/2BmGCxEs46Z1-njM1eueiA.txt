3	I came here because I was recommended by a friend to her hairstylist. I got there 5 mins earlier, but I had to wait because the hairstylist was late. I waited about 15mins. The place was nice, clean and had a couch to sit on while waiting. When the hairstylist came, he greeted me, introduced his self and told me to sit on the chair. He asked me what I wanted, I told him I wanted my friend's hair which is ombre because it looked really nice. When I asked him the price it was more than what my friend paid, so I just told him I'll go ahead and do the promo which is $85 color and cut. I already have an ombre hair but I needed to redo it because it was fading, so he dyed my hair with some kind of a dark brownish. I was a bit disappointed because I came in for an ombre, but I don't want to pay $150 for it while my friend only paid $85 because they were close friends. He told me, he was doing advertisement to my friend. The service was ok, he offered me coffee or water but he was a bit rough on massaging my head when he did shampoo, he also hit my head a couple of times with a brush and dryer while drying my hair but he apologized. They kept me long in the salon and had to pay $4 on parking, they only validate the first hour. I like my hair but i didn't love it.
5	I have been here to get my hair done for many yrs. I mean this salon location is newer but Paul's work is amazing. He is very honest and will give you his opinion on what you ask and sometimes even if you don't. Lol! He is very personable and will take his time with every single client. So be ready to be here for a while especially if you're getting more than just a haircut. Very worth the wait though!
5	Great salon. Michael is wonderful with color and cut. I always get great compliments after getting my hair done. I was still getting compliments on my last color and cut 3 weeks later.
