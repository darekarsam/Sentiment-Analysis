2	Yes, I know I have nothing better to do than review a by-the-slice pizza joint, but this could be useful under the circumstances.Can't remember what it was before, but the funny thing is how dingy and cruddy it was even when they opened about 10 years ago.The clientele ranges from sketchy to boozy, but I love it for it.The slices are medium in size and they have about 8-10 options on any given day. Most have been sitting there for a while, the hot sauce you can add is definitely required as it adds a bit of zip.If you order your own pie, it's gonna be much better, trust me on this.Their menu is pretty varied(they even have their own iPhone app), from chicken wings to subs and even beer. Their fried chicken just sits there for hours, why not fry it when ordered, frying is quick and easy.They are open late and are the Latin Quarter equivalent of Al-Taib, but their by the slice options have to improve as a couple of places have opened up nearby.
