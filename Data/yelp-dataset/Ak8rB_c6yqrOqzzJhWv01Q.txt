5	Wow! This place has given Samurai Sam's a run for their money.I stopped in today during lunch. It was busy, but I was helped quickly and my food was ready within three minutes. I ordered a standard chicken teriyaki bowl. The bowl was beautiful! You could tell that they really care about their food's presentation. They offer a spicy teriyaki sauce, and it was delicious! The meat was moist and flavorful; there was just the right amount of food.The price can't be beat - more food than Samurai Sam's at a lower cost. I will definitely be back!
5	Lunch special 7.29.. Best teriyaki chicken lunch I have eaten in Phx. This location is brand new so I love knowing the grill and kitchen appliances only have had a few weeks of cooking compared to older kitchens .. Love these healthy lunches!
2	Just OK.  I had a Dragon Roll, Tempura Shrimp and a drink and it was $20.  I can go to a real sushi restaurant with real service instead of a fast food counter and pay less than that.  The eel on the roll was bitter.  I've never experienced that in all my years of sushi eating.  The shrimp in the tempura was tasteless.   Big disappointment all around.
4	Excellent food, great quality. Would be 5 stars however the cashier told us it is "impossible" to sub noodles for rice in their teriyaki bowls. Said he was asked often but manager wouldn't allow. I think you should listen to your customers, Samari Sams is where we will frequent as we can get noodles in our Teriyaki Bowls.
5	This place reminds me of when I was a child. When life was simple,  when such simple pleasures as getting a new yo yo, or getting to spend the night at your best friends house was the greatest excitement in your life. I feel as though this fine dining establishment has captured this through teriyaki chicken and tempered California rolls.  So next time you are in search of nostalgia or maybe you are about to go search for the lost Dutchman's gold, stop by Yogis and fill your gullet with these oriental delights.
