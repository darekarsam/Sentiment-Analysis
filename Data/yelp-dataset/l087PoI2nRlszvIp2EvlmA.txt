5	I love this dry cleaners. They are always friendly and welcoming. They also do such an amazing job! You can't beat 1.99 a piece with great service ! They are also located near a massage parlor, nail shop and the park! They usually only take 2 days to finish all my stuff up and I always bring in around 30 items!
1	I didn't get service. If you don't drop off your clothes before 9am Thursday they will not be ready before 5 pm on Monday. This is horrible business service.Thecustomer service and organization of this place is very lacking.I would recommend going somewhere else.
1	Absolutely terrible company.  They ruined over a dozen of my dress shirts because they cannot follow simple directions. I've been in the business before while others complained of holes and burn marks.  My collars were melted and ruined, the shirts weren't wearable.  Their solution to fix my problem? "That's how all dress shirts are."  No offer to fix the problem, no offer to pay for their damage.  I would not recommend this company unless you like your clothes being damaged.
