3	No detail has been spared in transforming the previous commercial space into a lavish, oriental/exotic interior featuring a long hallway, main sitting area and private dining rooms.The regular menu is very conceptual, featuring five 4-course tasting menus, each revolving around a specific theme/ingredient.  At $150 per person and bottles of wine starting at $100, Arem is probably THE most expensive restaurant in town!Everything about Arem speaks of boldness, from its innovative branding/PR and lavish setting to its elaborate cuisine and premium pricing.  It remains to be seen if Montrealers will adopt the vision (and dish out the dough!)...
