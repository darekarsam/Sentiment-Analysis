5	I have been going to the Advanced Vision Institute since I moved to Las Vegas.  It is the only place that I go for my eyes . The front desk is very helpful and friendly. The assistants that take you back before Dr. Brooker comes in are wonderful.  And Dr. Brooker is the best!  He's so caring, friendly, knowledgeable, and takes whatever time you need to discuss any concerns. He helped me to make the best decision that changed my life completely. I had lasik surgery done and I can see  perfect without glasses or contacts.   I would highly recommend Dr. Brooker and his caring and able staff for any problems or issues relating to eyes.
5	This place blew me away with how dedicated they were to customer service. The doctor was very friendly and helpful and the whole thing was a great experience. I would recommend them to anyone!
5	Dr Brooker is one of the most thorough, patient and detailed people I have ever met. Not just Doctor's. Being a person who wanted to improve eyesight through Lasik technology, it was a process to get my eyes in position to benefit from the procedure. Dr Brooker delicately walked me through this process for several months. he was clear about all the benefits and more importantly risks associated. Also something to note, personally I never felt and pressure from Dr Brooker and felt his sole purpose was to educate and guide me through the process of maintaining healthy eyes.He's more than a 5 star.Nevada
