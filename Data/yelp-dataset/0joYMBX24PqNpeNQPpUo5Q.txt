4	The lempina bread from Natalia's has been a favorite of mine for awhile.  I'd been buying it at neighboring Euro Delicacies instead of at the actual bakery.  Yesterday, however, I finally checked it out and I am a fan. Why? They have Southern-Slav-style burek (a meat pie made with phyllo dough -- popular in Eastern Europe)!  And it looks good!  I didn't actually try it out, however, because some tasty looking baklava caught my eye and it was aweessomme (the extra letters denote extra goodness).  For $2.50 you get a generously-sized piece that tastes uber fresh.  Definitely my favorite baklava in Vegas.  I also purchased a tasty, salty breadstick for $1.00 - a breadstick (obviously) the size of a baguette. Natalia's also makes various cookies, cakes, and breads that I need to try, including the whole wheat bread.  If you're extra hungry, they also serve various sandwiches. The store is pretty bare bones and I wish they had at least some table seating.  It might be nice if they'd paint the walls and provide a table or two -- it would be nice to sit, relax and enjoy a cup of coffee with a pasty.  In the meantime, I'll just have to eat my lempina bread at home.
4	Oh my Baklava!!!The first time I came in, I just wanted to check things out. They had baklava in their refrigerator case, which was the only thing I recognized. So I ordered it. I was snacky so I started eating it right after I walked out. OMG, the baklava was the freshest, moistest, yummiest I have ever tasted. I crave for it. I have tried to go on Sat morning and they told me to come back later. So it is baked fresh! Wait is today Saturday!? Yes it is!! I will so a little bit later, hehe...I'm so excited :)
