3	This location of Rugged Warehouse is located in the McMullan Creek  shopping center.  I think it is slightly more organized than the one on Independence. I have found some good deals on cute things for my daughter from time-to-time but have not had any luck finding anything for myself here.  I have found some of the same exact merchandise over at  Burlington Coat Factory for slightly higher prices.
4	Great prices!  In my opinion there are better selections of guys clothes than ladies.  I've never found anything for me but we always find great deals for my boyfriend.  Tonight he purchased a nice Perry Ellis shirt originally $50 for $10!  Worth checking out ...
3	I do love Rugged Wearhouse, and this one is pretty organized. Why am I giving 3 stars, because I bought a pair of boots for $25, not a bad price, but the tag from the store was still on the shoes and it was marked $20. I still bought them, but why keep a tag that clearly states your selling something higher than what they are worth at a department store. Annoyed.
