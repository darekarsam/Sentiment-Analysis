1	What's with all these businesses proclaiming "Best" in their titles, you're just setting yourself up to be Yelped.My experience with Best Kebab couldn't have been more routine, except when I placed my order. The guy at the counter rung up the order and...pulled my chips from under the counter...all ready...like he made it 5 minutes before I even arrived.Now, if they can time travel and freshly cook my order before i've even entered the shop, then they can have the title Best Kebab.But in reality, I can only imagine how long it had been sitting there and walked out the shop as fast as I could.
1	When the guy who named this place the 'best' kebab house has a child I'm betting he will call it something like Dr. Cure-Cancer. He will then go on to be suprised when the child fails his first exam and drops out to become a kebab shop owner instead.Thats the sort of dissapointment you will feel when entering this kebab shop. The food is poor, the service is poor and overall the price is poor.Not a great place, certainly not the 'Best'.
4	No, it's not the best kebab house ever, but by no means the worst. On a kebab scale of pissed to Michelin, they are easily a 3, and gain a pont for great service, especially late night.And those potatoes? Oh they are good.
