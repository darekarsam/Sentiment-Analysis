3	Greasy spoon in Belmont! Quick, cheap, and tasty :)  The type of place with loyal regulars.  Great country ham and eggs.  No muss, no fuss, just how a breakfast spot like this should be!
4	Best breakfast in Belmont....love love love the White's
4	Simple, cheap. This place probably hasn't changed for decades. There really isn't a formal menu..just a list of what they offer on the wall. Your waitress will tell you what everything costs, but it's so reasonable..just order what you want.I usually get the two egg breakfast: eggs made to order, grits, toast-or-biscuit and a meat. Plus coffee. And it's only $4.50! Note - they only take cash and close around 1:30 pm
