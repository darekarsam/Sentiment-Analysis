5	Great tiny place, if you're not paying attention , you'll miss it. My latte ($3.00) was piping hot & very good, my sister , who is a big coffee drinker, had a regular coffee,($2.00) really liked hers... and she's very fussy about coffee!  Both coffees were made FRESH, you can watch the barista do this right in front of you. Service was quick, prompt & very pleasant. A great place for coffee on the go.
5	This place just proves that great coffee can come out of a hole in the wall. I've been here a half dozen times now, and it's never once disappointed. For $3.00, you get a delicious latte made fresh. The barista obviously knew what she was doing, and made one of the best lattes I've had in this city. If you're on the go and know what you're after (a great coffee), then this place is worth seeking out.
4	I wish there are more Hole in the Wall like La Distributrice that makes excellent espresso drinks around town.It is nice to sit in a coffee shop that has wifi, comfy seating, perfect cup ware but if the drinks that are not well made, I would rather give up all those perks.La Distributrice is just so simple, good coffee on the GO.This is one of the rare time I don't mind drinking out from a paper cup.
5	I will miss this place so much. I've gone there every day on my week long Montreal vacation. The iced Americano is such a lovely summer afternoon pick-me-up. The people who work there are always so charming.
