5	Every time I've been to Jerry's shop I've found the staff to be really friendly and helpful.  This little shop is a hidden gem for those of us who loose many balls in a few rounds of golf.
5	Great place to buy golf balls! Pro v1, Calloway , and Titleist balls have been used but not abused. Cheap
5	This place would be perfect if it were open on Sundays. I dropped by the Phoenix headquarters and there are most definitely deals to be had. A dozen "C" grade Pro V1 golf balls for around 10 bucks. Now, the sign might say "C" grade, but do a little digging around in the bin and you can easily find a dozen balls in excellent condition. I saw no noticeable scratches or blemishes, just the occasional logo or sharpie markings.  Structurally, these balls were in great condition and cleaned off very nicely.   This place has every top-shelf and middle of the road ball you can think of. All are in great condition for a great price. You'll also find good deals on nice used clubs. The re-gripping service is dirt cheap. But golf balls are bread-and-butter here and this place does it as well as anyone else. Quality is so far above the packaged used golf balls you'll find at target and sporting goods stores.
5	Jerry's is great. You will always find what you want and the prices can not be beaten. These golf balls are like new!!!!!
5	I rarely write reviews... I honestly only remember the bad and never really the good.  I have been to Jerry's 2 times in the past 2 months.  Both times I have worked with the lady behind the counter.  I can't begin to describe how helpful and the level of customer service this lady has.  I will never go anywhere else.  She is extremely kind to not only me, but extremely nice to my 4 year old daughter who was constantly grabbing different clubs.
