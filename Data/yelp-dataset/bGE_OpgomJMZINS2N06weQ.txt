5	great and friendly!
1	Very sloppy nail job. Gel manicure is uneven.  There is a chunk taken out of one nail.  Polish is bleeding out onto my cuticles.  Had have her do one nail again because a strip of nail was left unpolished.  I paid but asked for my money back.  They wouldn't refund unless I sat there and had the Polish completely stripped off again which isn't good for nail.  Don't go here.
