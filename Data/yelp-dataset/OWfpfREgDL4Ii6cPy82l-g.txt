5	Got a great trunk here for $18! They have tons of refurbished items and trinkets with lots of charm! The owner (or owner's son?) was so welcoming and was happy to explain to me how the consignment portion of the store worked.
5	This is the best place in the east valley to find vintage and antique items. With over 140 occupied booths, you'll find nice variety here. There are "man" themed booths, Victorian frills and lace, western flavored booths and lots of cool vintage kitchen ware. All kinds of win here!
4	Visited this store for the first time last week and Im hooked!  Very attractive and nicely laid out with a wide variety of merchandise at fair prices.  My only complaint is that they wrap your purchases in used newspaper instead of the plain wrapping paper all the other antique stores use and when I got my vase home I had to wash it to get the black newsprint off of it.  That's something I expect when I shop at Goodwill, not at a nice antique store.  Had to knock off a star for that.  Otherwise, this is a great place to shop.
3	Pros: Nicely laid out store with a wide variety of vintage merchandise.Cons:  Booths are not individually signed with percentage off discounts for store sales which makes things rather confusing.  Employees are hard to identify as they don't wear aprons, badges, etc.  Your purchase will be wrapped in used newspaper instead of clean wrapping paper.  All things that can be improved upon for a better shopping experience.
5	This place is huge and has a friendly, helpful staff. Starting with an excellent selection of small items all the way up to stunning antique furniture. They also have lounging areas with large TVs and a kid's room for those who wish not to partake in the "festivities".
