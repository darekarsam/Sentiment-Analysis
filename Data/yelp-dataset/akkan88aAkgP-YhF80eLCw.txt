5	If this is the one on 7th Street and near McDowell it has yummy gyros. Kind of weird for a gas station, don't us think?  Their soda was good too . they also have chesters chicken but I havent ate any of their chicken. Gyros are bomb with extra a sauce !! The ordeetakers/cooks were nice they do custom orders. Pinky says " Chicken alright. Big Assembly pieces." I could drink the Tazekei or however u spell it sauce . I like to drink good salsa Verde as well.
5	It's nice to have a serene place to go to in the concrete jungle. I love this gas station since there never seems to be anybody at this place when I'm gassing up.
5	Never have I heard of such a generous owner doing this for the community the gas is $1.99 right now. This is the best there was a line but totally worth it! Cashier was very nice great customer service! :)
