2	Fairly standard CVS - subpar service and all.  The pharmacy is my main gripe here.  I've not needed to interact much with the non-pharma staff.
4	The Pharmacy has been quick and efficient a couple times I have used them in past few years. The store layout works, the staff seems friendly, the place is clean. I don't know how I could rate them any lower than a 4, but not knocking it out of the park with a 5.
