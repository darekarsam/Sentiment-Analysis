3	Giving just 3 starts for now as this is based off of only one experience. Having moved recently I needed to find a closer Chinese take out place. China Inn was the first.Ordered with a few friends, & everyone liked their food a lot. Prices were very reasonable, food was piping hot, and everything actually seemed like it had just been cooked. No re-cooked. We ordered late (930 pm) so I was worried we would get a rushed mess since I believe they close at 10 during the week. But I was wrong. Thanks China Inn, will def be back.
4	Since writing my original review, I have returned several times, and always left a happy customer. The food is great, for what it is. Americanized Chinese takeout. Don't expect anything more, or less. They do what they do very well.On our last visit my wife phoned in the order and there was a slight miscommunication, once we got there to pick it up, and realized the mistake, they as well as us apologized as it was due to a slight language barrier. They got us what we wanted and on our way very quickly! We even left a few dollars tip, which I usually don't do for pick-up service, but the way everything was handled warranted it. This is now my go-to for quick Chinese take-out. Highly recommended!
1	My husband went into the place. The man gave him the wrong order then argued with him he did not give my husband back all his money. The worst experience ever. We will never go back. There food has fell off anyway.
4	We stopped in here one day to get lunch to go. It is really the kind of place you get take out, they have a couple of tables but it's mainly pick up orders. We sampled their spring rolls, vegetable lo mein, broccoli w/ garlic sauce  & Szechuan been curd all of which were delicious. It's just basic Chinese food nothing fancy. Pretty standard menu. They made our food pretty fast too.
3	If you're looking for cheap, Americanized Chinese food this is it.  Tasty and quick.  Can't go wrong.  I recommend Szechuan Bean Curd with fried rice.
