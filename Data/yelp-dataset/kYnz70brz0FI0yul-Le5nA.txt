4	Rosati's at Ray and McQueen is the BEST!  It is better than even Oregano's!  Thin Crust, thick crust---it doesn't matter.   The sauce is perfect and its just the right amount of cheese as well!  When you are not in a pizza mood, try a Chicago dog with fries or a salad.  This place doesn't disappoint.  Be careful though---you have to go to Ray and McQueen or McClintock and Warner to get GOOD Rosati's pizza.   (The one minus star is for the Italian beef---needs a little work still---kind of dry and flaky instead of juicy.)
1	Bland over priced pizza, rude bartender. Will not return at this location.
5	This place has excellent pizza and wings. Haven't tried much else yet, but I plan to. Great happy hour, relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff, all around a great place for lunch or dinner or just to grab a drink.
