5	Joe Craig and the other stylists at Salon Botanical offer old fashioned customer service in a modern salon. I've been a client for ten years, and would not think of going anywhere else. Mui's manicures are the best I've ever had. -Great Dilworth location!
5	This is the best salon I have been to!  Very competent stylists who are friendly, accessible, and the right blend of professional yet fun. The whole salon has an easy, friendly vibe- plus a great location! I especially love "the front room" with Laura, Jeff, and Joe! I travel from NYC to get my hair cut here!
5	Love Joe and the other folks at Salon Botanical. I had a color crisis, (tried to do my own roots), called Joe, told him what I did- roots turned pink! He kindly told me to come in, worked me in, and fixed my mistake!
5	Before moving to California, I worked at this salon with Joe, Laura, Julie, Tiffany, Beth and Jeff. It is by far the most creative group of professionals I've ever had the pleasure of working with.Their work is Top notch, they listen to the needs of the customers and offer suggestions in a positive way.  I highly recommend any of these fine artists to meet your needs. You will not be disappointed!
5	I have been going to Joe & Tiffany even before joe opened salon botanical! I love them and the salon! I recommend salon botanical to everyone who is looking for a new stylist/salon. It's easy to schedule an appointment and the whole crew is fabulous!
