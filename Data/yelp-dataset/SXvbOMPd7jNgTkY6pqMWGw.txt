1	I hate to be negative. But not good at all. The worse I have had in a long time. The chicken had some weird batter on it, the egg foo young gravy was off tasting, and I'm not sure what type of meat was in the wontons. Just trying to be helpful
1	HORRIBLE over fried unrecognizable meat in hard batter. Rice is reheated.
