2	Dirty. Not well staffed or cleaned.
3	As far as getting gas,  this location is close and very convenient for me.   Since I just pay at the pump, I haven't been inside to see how service is.  But for most, when you get gas, it's a quick stop and you're on your way.  Before you leave their location, there is the Purple Penguin Snowcone Shack located near the pumps.  It's hard to miss their building in the summer months and usually a long line.  Otherwise it's just your average gasoline pit stop.  Convenient but we all hate what it does to our wallets!
