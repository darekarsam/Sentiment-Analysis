5	I have had a few AC companies come to look at my AC units, and I am supremely satisfied with the customer service and work provided by Peterson.  Jeremy was knowledgeable and helpful; the individuals on the phone was courteous; they resolved all of my questions and issues.  Jeremy also walked around my house with me to check all of my vents and possible sources of AC loss.  Try Peterson!  :)
5	Imagine this, it is 106 degrees in Scottsdale and your air conditioning unit decides to break at that very inopportune moment.  To the rescue comes Robert from Peterson.  He and his son Tony assured me that in one day I would be up and running.  Little did I know that a huge crane would be necessary to facilitate the operation.  At one point six people were working diligently to provide me with the service they promised.  I received another estimate but decided to select Peterson based upon their attention to my situation.  The owner, Ron, came to my house to oversee the operation, his son Derrick was on hand in case additional resources were needed and the two guys driving the crane spent their youth with Tonka trucks I am sure.This is a first-class operation with a personal, family touch.  Consider them when you are looking to solve your air conditioning needs.
5	Replaced 2 AC units in my home and one in my rental home.  Fast efficient and they know their stuff!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND
1	Run the other way! Overpriced. Recommending unnecessary service. Misrepresent their service plans. Not communicative when problems come up. Never again.
