1	Happy dental? My girlfriend walked out crying, because it took more than 2 hrs to put on ONE crown when this procedure usually takes around 30 mins, and the worst part is the doctor didn't even finish the procedure! The doctor said that the crown won't set right ? So you spent the whole time making it worse ? So anyways we got there at exactly 5 pm , place closes at 6 and my girl friend stormed out crying at 7:23!?! Why schedule her so late if it's gonna take 2 hours to due a 30 mins procedure. Happy dental we are certainly not happy , never every coming back again.
4	I have been going to Happy Dental since they opened. Always friendly and efficient, I will continue to go here.
4	They have good staff working there very friendly . they called my name  on a timely manner the only thing I didn't like was the waiting time on the doctor... It took a long time for her to show up.  Overall Everything else was good
