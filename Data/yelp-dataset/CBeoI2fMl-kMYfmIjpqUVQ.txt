4	The owner greeted us as soon as we walked in the door.  The store is spacious and features many county themed home decor items.  We were offered cookies and some dip that was made from the packaged dips they feature in the store. It was just before 11 when we went on Saturday and there were already people walking out with purchases.  The store owner really does know the value of her items, so expect to pay retail prices. I would happily shop here again and bring a friend. :)
5	A great place to find the gift for the hard to buy for person. I could also find lots of thing for the not so hard to buy for, myself!!! Great staff and wonderful place to shop!
1	I'm usually so happy with this store and I love supporting local so it pains me to write this.  I took my best friend and her mom there (which I have been wanting to do for years, her mom lives in NY) We were just in the store and the usual owner wasn't there.  The sign said all christmas 75% off and christmas light signs 60% off.  When we went to check out a santa and reindeer the man said "oh these aren't included in the christmas sale, they are year round and so they are only 50% off." It was so upsetting because the santa and reindeer are not all year round items.  The man would not honor the sale price and he proceeded to rip down all the signs.  I will not shop at one of my favorite stores again.  Such a bad experience.
