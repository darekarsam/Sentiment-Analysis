4	Brought my oldest daughter to get her eyes checked because her teacher said she squinted alot. Staff was nice, testing was quick, in and out in about 30 minutes. We'll be back to pick up her glasses in 5-10 days.
5	Dr. Ian Kawamoto is my eye guy! He is smart, and good with people. He also has a nice staff.  My first time there, I was the first appointment of the day, he opened the door for me to come in and while a few minutes before they were officially open, so I didn't have to wait in the cold.  He was sweet, and gave me forms to fill out since his receptionists were not there yet.  I didn't realize he was the doctor until later on when it was time for my appointment.  He does what is necessary to maintain good customer service.  He understood what I had to say, and gave me real feedback, and referred easy to obtain products that were inexpensive, that work and are needed rather than something "he thinks should help."
1	Dr. Kawamoto and his staff are very happy to give you a pres Tipton, but are impossible to work with if you move. I tried several times to get simple info relayed to me so I could reorder glasses online. Their response was "just come back into the office and we will provide that to you". Worthless.
1	Did he close? I moved away from Vegas a few years ago so I haven't seen him in 3 years. I'm now calling to try and get my records but can't find a number that works.
