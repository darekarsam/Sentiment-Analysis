4	Great coffee place in historic Old La Prairie.  Excellent specialty coffees, great homemade soups and sandwiches, cute little cakes and pastries.  Free Wi-Fi.  They have tons of boardgames, classics and newer ones.  We normally enjoy a stroll with the kids in this pretty part of town, then a snack and a game at the coffee shop, and finish off with a trip to the candy store across the street by the church.  Perfect day!
