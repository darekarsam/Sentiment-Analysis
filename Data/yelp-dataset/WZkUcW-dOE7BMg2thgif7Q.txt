4	A dentist that's open on a Friday? Unheard of! But there's this Dentistry of the Carolinas office which is one of their branches in the Charlotte area and they were able to see me for a semi-emergency visit. Good service, quality dentistry, and they're open on Friday. What's not to love??
5	I was a brand new patient here and my experience was wonderful. All of my appointments were scheduled with ease and promptness. The staff members I encountered here were all very nice and Dr. Schuyler and Dr. Marti were wonderful. Dr. Schuyler did (8) white composite resin feelings for me and everything turned out great as this was the first time in my life I have ever had fillings performed. Carrie is wonderful, and Tonya "T" is wonderful. I recommend this location filled with outstanding staff members for anyone who requires dental attention and or assistance.
5	Gotta love this Dental practice! Why? Dr. Marti and her staff! And they accomodate my every other Friday off schedule! Super professional, uber friendly, and most importantly (from a patient's standpoint) is that they are GENTLE! Drugs rule at the dental office (uh that would be LEGAL "drugs" like novacaine, etc.They have automated emails to remind you of appointments which is great.Just a really great practice with warm, friendly people who make going to the dentist as "pleasant" as possible. If you're looking for a Dentist I would highly recommend Dr. Marti and her practice!
