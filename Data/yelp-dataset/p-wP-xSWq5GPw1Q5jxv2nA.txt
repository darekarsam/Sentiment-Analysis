1	If you like bad chinese food, you'll love this place. It's one of those everything-tastes-the-same kinda places. Even the fortune cookie was boring; it said, 'have fun tonight.' Got delivery, kung pow chicken and s&s pork (though it could've been a shoe for all I could tell). Right now, I'm lying in bed, hoping I won't have terrifying weird protein-induced dreams, clutching my stomach. Have fun tonight, indeed.
4	i love the general Tao there it is simply the best i ate !! maybe i need someone to prove me wrong  .. and my second favourite dish is the  sesame beef , both come in the special menu with imperial rolls  and  soup (won-tong or sweet and sour ) the sweet and sour soup is simply delicious !!  i never order anything else  !! my gf love the general Tao tofu .. my 2 cents
1	Awful Chinese food. Probably the worst place to eat asian in the whole neighbourhood. I ordered fried won tons and I got tiny crispy noodles that you're supposed to put in the soup. Furthermore, when they include veggies in their meat dishes, they just cut them into big pieces and barely cook them. I have so many examples of why this is place is bad and I could go on for an hour, but I won't. Oh, and I forgot to mention that when I went there to pick up my order, the cook sneezed in his hands and kept cutting food without washing them!!! I have to admit that their sweet and sour soup is good though, but it's not worth the shitty main course you'll get.
