5	Wonderful chef. Good prices. Stand out food.
5	Went to Montreal on a little city vacation, to see a Habs game and just have a good weekend. Had an early check in at my hotel and took a quick nap. Wanting something easy for lunch, I headed for McKiernan. Apparently, I arrived just at closing time. Before noticing the sign on the door, I opened it. I believe that it was Amanda that came to the door. She was very sweet and said that they were just closed. Embarrassed, I apologized and started to turn around, before the door closed she told me to hang on. She went to the counter and spoke with the two young men who were running the open kitchen and they all ushered me in. There was one other couple finishing their lunch and I fully intended on eating quickly and letting them close up shop, but McKiernan wasn't having it! I was treated very well. I enjoyed my lunch (grilled cheese, bacon and onions yummmy!), while conversing a bit with Amanda. I had a great local Rye ale to wash it all down with. I was even offered desert and coffee, no rush whatsoever. High marks for good, reasonably priced comfort food, a funky and fun atmosphere and welcoming and friendly staff!! Thanks guys, I will be back!
