2	I have mixed feelings on this place. The first time I went in the dr spent a lot of time with me and explained things out. Today the second time, I asked to have a mole removed. What I got instead is a 30 min wait in the waiting room (ironic since they have a sign that says there is a fee for missed appts) and 30 seconds with the dr. No exaggeration. Disappointed today for sure.
1	If I could give less than one star I would. Doctors and nurses were great, billing is a nightmare. I called twice because I had not received a bill, confirmed my address both times, and both times was told I'd receive a bill. No option to pay over the phone or online. Instead of sending me my bill, they sent it to collections. I called AGAIN to try to resolve it and they were not helpful at all, and were even rude about it. I'll never go back and strongly recommend against this place. Unfortunately for the rest of the practice, billing is really messing it up. Also, from other reviews I've seen here and elsewhere, I'm not the only one with this same story.
5	This office is great. From making an appointment to patient care.  I love that this office offers cosmetic services & has a medical aesthetician.
1	I'm very upset with University Dermatology. They sent my bill to a wrong address (it ended up with a neighbor since it was a digit off) and then sent it to collections before talking to me. I payed the bill with collections, only to receive a notice from the office later that I could no longer receive care from them because of the late payment. Completely unprofessional! When I called the office to explain that when I did eventually receive my bill it had a mis-typed address, they were rude to me and didn't care that I was paying collections to fix an issue that wasn't even my fault. I didn't write the wrong address on my paperwork, your staff needs to be careful about missing numbers. Now I have to find a new dermatologist, since they won't see me anymore.
