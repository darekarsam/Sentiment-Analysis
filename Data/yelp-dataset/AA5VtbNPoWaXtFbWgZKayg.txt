5	I think this place is new here in HoMa, because I never heard of it before.But I'm so happy I found out about its existence, because we finally have some great Indian food here and on top of that: They deliver!We ordered:Soupe DahlSamosa aux legumeJal'Frezi (agneau)Poulet a la mangueBindi BhajeeShahi PaneerNaan & Riz PilauEverything was tasty, but the mango chicken, dahl soup and okra (bindi bhajee) were my personal favourites, oh and the naan, the naan was super duper tasty too.I hope they stay this amazing, we really needed a place like this. They're not super cheap, but the food was worth it imho.I will order from this place again in the future, for sure.
5	On business in Quebec.... Three terrible meals elsewhere.... Resorted to a Yelp search .... Which pointed me here.You will not be disappointed - classy place - great service - good food at a reasonable price.Highly recommended
5	I just came back from Diya with a group of my friends and let me tell you the food was full of flavor and spice just like back home as I am East Indian. The staff treated us like royalty and honestly we had no complaints about this classy Indian resto what so ever. I highly recommend anyone to try the food here compared to all other Indian joints in MTL this one rocks!!!
3	I just had dinner at Diya with my boyfriend. The food was good but it was pricey. It has small portions and is definitely fine dining. If you are looking for an inexpensive night of Indian food with large portions, this is not the place.
