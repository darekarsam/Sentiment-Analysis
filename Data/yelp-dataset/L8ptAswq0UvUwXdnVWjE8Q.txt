4	Tired of German food? Go there and try the Mexican specialities. The quality of the food is good and even simple nachos are delicious.Cocktails are also available and make it a place to start the evening before heading to a club.Prices are slightly higher than usual but are in phase with what you can find at ludwigplatz.
