4	This is the place that my friends and I have always gone. The service has been great, regardless of whether we were a group of five, or a group of thirty! I will agree that before it was renovated, it was quite dumpy (ripped couches, etc), but it has recently been upgraded and it was worth the wait! New touchscreen song selection, updated drink (and food) menu, new couches, and an excellent atmosphere! For the price, it is totally worth checking out! The only thing that is problematic is that the new song selection system has no English or French setting, and so the waitress will have to explain how to use it...and you will have to remember what all of the different icons do!
2	The place is nicely renovated, somewhat new furnitures with great touchscreens for easier song selection. In addition, most of their songs are fairly new, and they seem to update their song list often.The reasons why I am giving it a such low rating:- No service whatsoever, they pretty much just takes your money and leave you alone- Pretty pricey comparing to other places, about 50$/hr- At that price, I'd expect at least a drink, but they didn't even bother to offer us water, or a menu, or anything at all- Cashier was rude to one of my friend :\- No credit cardIf they can do something about their terribad service, I'd love to return and give an updated review.
