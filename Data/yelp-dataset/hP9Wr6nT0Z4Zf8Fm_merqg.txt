4	The Lexus Club is a restaurant within the Consol Energy Center.  You must b e a member or have Club tickets to an event to get in.  The Lexus Club is a large restaurant that, before hockey games, offers an extremely upscale buffet.  Pricey at around $50 per person.  Well appointed  with dishes you normally would not find on a buffet.  Lollipop lamb chops, Cajun Pork Loin, Prime Rib, Roast Duck, are just some of the things you may find.  Great desserts.  Expansive appetizer and salad choices and a pasta station as well.  **you must have tickets for Lexus Club, Captain Morgan Club or First Niagara Club seats in order to dine in the Lexus Club**Synopsis: Pricey to say the least but a flashy buffet you don't feel totally bad to pay $50 for.  Worth trying if you like trying new things and aren't solely a meat and potatoes kinda person.
3	For the hungry!  Big buffet.  Some great experiments like cabbage and spaetzle.  Attentive staff.  Lost a star for atmosphere (missing) and substandard desserts (whipped sugar in many forms).
