1	They work off commission and will try to sell you a bunch of unnecessary repairs. They even showed a picture they had taken after inspection of a supposedly dirt filled coil that desperately needed cleaning. We weren't born yesterday so after getting their laundry list of repairs, we naturally got a 2nd opinion.  Not only were those list of repairs not needed, we found out they hadn't even removed the panel to the a/c unit in the attic to inspect the coil in the first place.  If they had, there would have been finger prints or rub marks from them disturbing the dust on the panel in order to remove it.  The 2nd company said the dust on the cover of the panel was never disturbed.  This also means that the "picture" of the dirt filled coil was not a picture of OUR coil.  That is disturbing on so many levels!
5	I told them what I thought I needed and they got someone out to do the work in a couple of hours.  They charged me according to what we agreed on the phone and solved my problem.  I would use them again.
1	Wouldn't you know their out of business. I had a Tec come out last summer and he charged me under the table. Half of what the company had quoted me. Plus he still charge me a trip charge only to install $75.00 dollars in parts. Thank God there out of business.
