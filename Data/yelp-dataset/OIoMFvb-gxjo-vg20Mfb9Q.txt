5	My younger sister, boyfriend and I recently did a shoot with John for Prom and it was perfect! He engaged with all three of us throughout the shoot and made sure we were each enjoying ourselves, despite the time crunch and heat. He provided waters, encouraged us to take funny/goofy pictures and made sure we all had the shots we wanted. The best part was how dedicated he seemed to get good shots, at one point he even laid on the ground to make sure he got the perfect angle for a jumping picture we all wanted to do.On top of the shoot being a blast, the photos turned out great! The spots John chose as backgrounds really helped to make the the three of us stand out while also complementing our outfits. We received our photos back very quickly in both raw and JPEG form, which was great! I would definitely recommend John for any type of shoot, especially with individual or small group subjects, and I suggest people go after him now before he realizes he could be charging a lot more for his services!
5	I met John at the Yelp Western Adventure event back in March.  Anyone Yelp gets to be an event photographer you know they are yeelllppping cooool!!  John handled hundreds of requests from Yelpers asking him to take their photos that night and he always answered with enthusiasm and a smile.  A photographer that can handle masses of Yelpers indulging themselves on copious amounts of free flowing alcohol tells me whaat a greeeaaaattt guy he is!
