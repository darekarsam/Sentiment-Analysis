5	They did an excellent job replacing my shattered iPad mini screen!  They were also very friendly and happily answered ALL of my questions. I will definitely recommend this business.
5	I don't write that many reviews, but I felt this one was a must. I shattered the front of my iphone 5 and researched many places to go. Eventually a couple people mentioned this place to me. They had a $20 yelp coupon, quoted me the lowest price, and were very close to where I live so I decided to try them out. My phone was finished within 30 minutes and looks and works perfectly. I don't know if the women working was the owner, or manager but she was genuinely friendly, helpful, and patient considering my toddler was touching everything! In a fix far exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend them!
5	I had shattered my screen and went to them to fix it. The lady working the front was so nice and answered any of my questions I had. They were able to get my phone fixed in less than 45 minutes! My phone looks brand new. I highly recommend this place for any electronic repair!
