5	Nikki does an amazing job she always knows what I want and gives me the look I had in mind. She is very friendly and an outstanding hairstylist you can't go wrong! I have only been going to her for 3 years now.
5	Can't say enough great things about Nikki!! I have never gone back to anyone more than twice and I'm 35. Nikki has been my go to stylist for a year. I have recommended multiple people who have all been extremely happy with her services.  She is professional, and a true hair artist. If I could rate her over 5 stars I would !!
5	Nikki is AMAZING!!! I found her by luck about a year ago and will never go to anyone else again. She truly cares about how your hair turns out.  She is very friendly, professional and great at what she does. Every time she does my hair I get compliments. You can't go wrong with Nikki!
