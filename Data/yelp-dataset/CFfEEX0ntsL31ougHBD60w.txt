3	I was here last night for the IronFork competition.
3	Geez - great venue but man oh man can you learn how to work the AC???  We were here for the Iron Fork competition and had to leave early because there were a TON of people and no AC on.  We were dying.  The venue is located right at Davidson and 26th or so in front of the breweries.  There looked like there was parking around the back but we parked across Davidson in the grass lot on the other side.This would be a great venue for events if they can get the AC kinks worked out.  Huge clean building with seating on one side.  Can definitely see a reception of sorts being great here.
