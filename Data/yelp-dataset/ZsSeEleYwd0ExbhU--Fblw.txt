1	Terrible!! Management SUCKS.
5	I have never experienced any of the issues previous reviewers have mentioned here. The management staff has always been right there to address any problems I have had. Be it bad neighbors or around the home maintenance concerns. They are a click and call away as they are with all of the Camden properties in Las Vegas. Maybe I'm fortunate to live near the office, maybe its because I pay my bills on time, but whatever the reason, I've never lived in a complex quite like this one. And I have lived all over this town in numerous apartments over the last 25 years in Vegas. The management team makes themselves available online and in person. The maintenance are always sunny and cheerful, unlike many places where I feared my things would get rummaged through when I'm not home. They even post these uplifting banners on the exit gates that bring a smile to your face. I cant recommend a place more than I can Camden Breeze. The in home amenities are basic and nothing "fancy" like huge Roman Tubs, but those are things that don't concern me much. I love it here.
3	Agents, landscape, and prices are great. Trying to get in touch with someone is a problem and we live in the back and we seem to get neglected.  Also, I'm disabled no handicap capabilities or accessible.  But surrounding area is great, close to shopping and scenic areas.
