3	super unprofessional and crowded just had a person walk into my room while I was talking to the nurse? Really? Watched two people leave in the waiting room for being here too long. Place needs to organize their appointments more efficiently other than that the staff is kind and knowledgeable they just are biting off more than they can chew sometimes.
3	It is not a fun having to visit any doctor, especially a specialist. I am tired of having the first question about me being 'what insurance do you have, and how will you be paying anything they do not cover'. Well, it was no different here. Luckily, I have a line of credit through 'CareCredit', and CNS accepts this. However, it proved to be a slight chore for the billing department to figure out just exactly HOW to bill it. I had to call CareCredit, have them explain it to me, so that I could explain it to the billing person. Ugh.  It seems to take a minimum of 30 days to get an appointment, which stinks. Visit for testing was 5 weeks after initial visit, 5 weeks for follow up. Who has time for this!?The nurses and technicians are very friendly, and I liked them very much. While Dr Germin is very knowledgeable, and I trust his expertise his bed side manner leaves something to be desired. I felt scrutinized, small and ignorant in his presence. That's just my opinion. That being said, I was not there to make friends. I was there for his professional opinion and I got it. I am glad that the nurse was in the room with us, as she was very friendly, and concerned about me. My review is actually 3.5. Stars off for lack of appointment availability, difficulty with billing, and my feeling insignificant around the doctor.
