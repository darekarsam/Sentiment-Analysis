5	BEST COFFEE EVERLove this place.Actually maybe a bit better than my other review of Victor Allen's...but I like their cafe a bit better. This is more of a place to stop by than to stay.Get the Ancora D'Oro for home, and the White Zombie for right now. (Almond flavor is my favorite) Or the mocha, which is heavenly. Seriously, the best mocha I've ever had. EVEREVEREVER. The chocolate has some weight, but blends perfectly to be a grown-up version of chocolate milk you had as a kid. The White Zombie is a strange and beautiful thing. A "white coffee" drink, it's light and powerful, you will feel like a high-powered cloud ghost zooming around after drinking this. They tried to change the name to White Lightning, but no one wants to feel a crackling electric jolt. Don't worry, the zombie will carry you through the day like a white flotaki magic carpet, smooth, airy and sensuous.
3	Great coffee! But alas, the service is quite slow during the AM rush hour.  It looks as though there is quite a bit of new staff right now so understandable that it wouldn't be super speedy....but having two people making coffee during peak hours would make me much more likely to stop for java on my way to work.  Also, thumbs up on stocking Batch Bakehouse!
