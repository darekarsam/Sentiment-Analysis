3	Your basic fried stuff and burgers.  Not bad, not good.  Kinda pricey for what you get.
3	Of all the crazy places in this crazy world, Max and Ermas had superb potstickers, perhaps the best I've ever had.I was pleased.I went there a few times, though, and never found an entree I didn't hate.  So I have to give it an uneven rating -- but if you like potstickers, and feel like making a meal of them, you really should try this at least once.
3	This is a chain, so don't expect somthing fresh, flavorful or in any way unique or exotic.That said, I like their Buffalo chicken burgers.
3	Max and Erma's is not the sort of place that you go for fine dining. However, I do have many fond memories of coming here with many good friends and even a few crushes in my early years. If you find yourself hanging out with friends in Shadyside, it's an adequate place to grab a bite to eat. There are definitely some other places in Shadyside that offer better fare, but Max and Erma's is to Shadyside what Eat N' Park is to Squirrel Hill - a basic place to meet up with friends.
3	In early July, my family and I arrived in Pittsburgh after a fun-filled long weekend at Geneva-on-the-Lake.  We checked into our hotel in Shadyside, then took a walk.  After 30 or 40 minutes, we were tired and hungry, and though it was a "funny" time to eat---about 3 p.m.---we went up the stairs to Max & Erma's.     Our server was perky without overdoing it, and she served us well.  Our meals were all very good. My daughter and I each got a sandwich. She got a turkey one of some sort (I forget its fancy name), and I got the vegetarian sandwich (also had its own title).  We each had a half of one another's. I don't know which sandwich tasted better!        So I'll go back to this place when I'm in the area.
