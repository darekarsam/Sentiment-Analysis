5	Had bike trouble during bike week. Called Precision and he said he could be there in 30 minutes. This was 8 o'clock on a Friday. Showed up in 25 minutes, loaded the bike in 5 minutes and we were on our way. Great service, excellent tow vehicle. Couldn't ask for more.
4	Awesome customer service and great truck to help the motorcyclist in need of help. Thank you very much for getting our bike home safe :)
5	I couldn't have had a better towing experience.--The phone line was answered promptly and courteously. --We set an appointment within my schedule. --He gave a pre-call as he was arriving to let me know he was near--He arrived on-time!--The tow-truck was secure and efficient--He arrived at the shop right within his estimate.--Great customer service!Great job, PBT.
