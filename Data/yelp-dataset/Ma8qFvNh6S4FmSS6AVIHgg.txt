5	Great prices, great service, amazing at Up-do's. I have followed this hairdresser throughout montreal and im so glad he finally opened his own place. I always get compliments when i get my hair done here, and it lasts. ask for Kaled if you want a great up-do for a special occasion. He is amazing at doing great Chignon. polite and attention detailed staff.
5	This is the best place in Montreal to get your hair done. I let no one else touch my hair except Khaled. I am always happy with the results. Everyone at this coiffure is very professional and works as a team.  There is good energy and it makes you want to come back at least once a month. The prices are also reasonable and they sell the best shampoo products in the market and they are less expensive than the big hair salon stores.  I recommend all my friends to get their hair done at this place. I have lived abroad and have been proposition to get new hairdresser but no one can do my hair as well as Khaled. The staff is great and always offering me something to drink and they are great people to lend an ear.Hands down this is the best place to get your hair get cut, styled and receive a fabulous up do.
4	Friendly staff. Love sitting down and having a chat with them. Great at what they do.
