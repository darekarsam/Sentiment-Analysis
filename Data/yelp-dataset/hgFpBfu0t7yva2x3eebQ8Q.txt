5	I go past this place almost everyday on my way to university. Everytime I go by the smell makes me feel like I just went to cookie monsters family potluck. Ugh its so intoxicating. Therefor I decided I would never go because I would turn into cookie monster himself and eat everything in sight. Well....sigh...my friend took me and I did just that! I bought two massive bags of chocolate chip cookies from the reject bin ( its ok orphan cookies you will have a nice home with me ) and took them home. Little did these cookies know that half their comrades would be gobbled up with in the week. I have slowed down no to savior the other bag but let me tell you this place is great. Some of the best cookies I have ever had ( store bought mind you ) and super super cheap. If you have the munchies and or want to adopt some orphan cookies go here and buy to your hearts content. You won't be disappointed especially if you get a good bag with some of the more doughy cookies wow those are the best and were the first to go. Love this place!
