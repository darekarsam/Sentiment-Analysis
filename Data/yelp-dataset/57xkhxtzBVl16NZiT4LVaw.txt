5	Excellent service, have gone there for 3 years and found them to be very honest.  They never try to push anything extra on to you, in fact they have saved us money on several occasions.  Courteous treatment by talented technician named Chris at the Power Road location.
5	I went to this business for a wheel alignment.  I asked if the tires needed to be rotated and balanced, as well.  They performed the alignment and said the wear on the tires looked good, and we should rotate and balance them at the next oil change.  I felt like this was really an honest way to do business - not trying to just add on stuff to raise the price.  And, we had an appointment - they were right on time - we didn't have to wait at all.
5	I returned to Robert's with another vehicle to align.  I made an appointment with Luis, and they took me in promptly at my appointment time, and performed an excellent job on my alignment - thanks Robert's Tire Sales!  Very honest old fashioned service.
1	I went in to set up a tire replacement for my tractor and Luis refused, flat refused, to provide an estimate or a copy of the work order he created. Has all the ear-marks of a bait and switch company, I will never do business with them! I will not take a chance on being ripped off!
