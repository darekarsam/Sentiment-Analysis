4	I have enjoyed my services at Spa Savanna for years.  In July 2012, the spa was sold to new owners and they have brought a new philosophy to the spa and tons of new services.  Yesterday, I enjoyed a microdermabrasion facial with the latest in micro-diamond technology.  The treatment was excellent and my face is silky and smooth.  She finished with a sun-screen which made me feel taken care of.  Great massage and mask to top it off.
