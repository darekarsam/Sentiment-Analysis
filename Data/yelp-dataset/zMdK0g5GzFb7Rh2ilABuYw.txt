3	All the supplies you need for a static wedding.
4	I found a place that sells sealing wax before I found a place to buy toothpaste.Priorities people, priorities.Don't worry, I don't put obscure crafting hobbies in front of dental hygiene. It just so happens that this little haunt is a few blocks down from my temporary digs and I am physically unable to walk past a store that has "Stamps" on the front.I love a good stamp.This is basically a crafters dream store, that has been stuffed into a much smaller space. It's positively bursting at the seams! Need sealing wax? It's under one of the displays and near the ink pads. A notebook? Shuffle the paper aside and tuck down next to the pens. It's one of those places where you will not be able to find something without assistance.Thankfully, that's quick and helpful, and you'll soon feel less like you're about to die by falling craft supplies and be skipping out the door with goods in hand. I found the paper to be a little on the pricey side, but the pens, stamps and seals were right on target. If there are any scrapbookers out there in the cosmos, maybe leave your credit card at home - this place will quickly become the bane of your pocketbook's existence.But for this amateur glue gun wielding craft gal, it was a happy find in a new city and I will gleefully wax seal letters home for the next few weeks to come!
