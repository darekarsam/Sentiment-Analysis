5	Very nice. Very relaxed in the middle of chaos. I come here often because of the friendly service! Definitely 5/5 *s :)
1	The coffee is good, but that staff is terrible. Have frequently heard one of the girls that works there chew-out other employees...save the bitchiness for when you don't have a line of customers
2	The terrible service here results in bad coffee. The coffee here always tastes bad. Worse than every other Starbucks I go to.  The staff doesn't listen to customers. I always ask for two pumps of cinnamon dolce in my iced coffee, but they always put the standard 6. I also asked for water once and the cashier just stood there doing nothing so I asked if I could get it now. She said no it will be waiting at the end. Laziness equals dissatisfied customers.
