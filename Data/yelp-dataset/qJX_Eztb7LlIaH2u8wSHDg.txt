5	I've been attending this church for the past 18 months and attending this church has changed my life.This is a non denomination church. Which means it doesn't matter your race or religious beliefs we're here to share the gospel and spread the truth of Jesus Christ. Now, this isn't the type of church that's gonna try and badger you or beat you over the head with a bible and try to judge you on your ways lol. We have new beginner classes for those who may have never accepted Jesus as their Lord and Savior. On Tuesday's theres a Men's Intercessory class to help put God into the lives of men. Also there's a women's bible study class on Tuesday with the same mission. On Wednesday's a relationship class is open to help bring couples not only closer to each other but also closer to God. On Friday's, Prayer and Worship and Men's Intercessory class pt. two is open. Then of course there's Sunday where two sermons happen.The pastor is former NFL quarterback Randall Cunningham and us as a church welcomes everyone with open arms so feel free to come down anytime.
5	I love this church. So well organized and yet the Spirit of the Lord is alive. The pastor is a down to earth family man. I am always encouraged to live my life in a better way with integrity, grace & love
5	This is a place of tremendous love.  I have visited many times and would attend more if my schedule would permit.  I received the gift package with the mug on my first visit and it was very nice.  The members are friendly and polite.  The music is very lively and meaningful.  If you like a large, loving, family-oriented church, this is a great place to try.  I really like their inclusiveness, singing songs in Spanish and English during the service.  I like the multicultural atmosphere.  It is nice to embrace other cultures and styles while you worship.  They really do practice "Come just as you are."  Please attend Remnant if you like positive worship experiences.
