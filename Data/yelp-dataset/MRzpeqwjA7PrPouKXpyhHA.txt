4	BounceU is the new party hot-spot for kids as we attended 3 parties over the last 2 weeks.  They also have daily bounce hours for a fee.  The party rooms are nice with limited seating while the food and cake are being served......which is usually pizza from Hungry Howie's and you can bring your own cake, or they will supply it.  They have several different types of bounce units which allows the kids to bounce themselves silly:-)  The location is not far from Northlake Mall which is very convenient if you live in the area.
3	I just went here for my son's 9th birthday.  I Was looking for an all inclusive place,  bounce, fun, food. When we got there, we were told that food isn't served on weekends.  The website nor the person over phone said that. Overall, the experiment was lackluster but it was something different for the kids so they liked it.
5	I love Bounce U because my kids love it and that's all that matters.  What I like about it is they don't have a ton of games like other bounce house places so you can keep your spending cost down. If I go somewhere else I wind up easily spending $50.00 on games and the kids still want more tokens just for those plastic little prizes, go jump, have fun!  They also have amazing Groupon deals, right now you can go to free play for 1/2 price on groupon only $4.50 or something like that.  My son is 7 years old.
