1	Shame. Very convenient location but one of their stylists likes making inappropriate comments about your family. So I'm never going back.
5	Great value! Nice staff. They made me feel welcome and did a great job. Not too bad for 16$. Also if you sign up you get a 2$ coupon. I would recommend this for a quick and easy haircut.
5	Been going to Jessi (the girl who runs this place I think) since she worked in their location in the south hills. She's super friends and great with coloring (Obvi! Look at her colors!!!) and won't ever point you in the wrong direction. I knew she was great when I came in one day with an idea for a style that would not have looked good on my face and she very politely told me no and suggested some other things. The other girls there have been very friendly as well and I would definitely recommend this place for anyone's haircut!
