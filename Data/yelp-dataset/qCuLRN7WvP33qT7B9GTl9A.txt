1	This is a buffet style restaurant that was absolutely disgusting in ever possible aspect of the place.  The bathrooms were unclean, which was unacceptable for a restaurant, I would have rather used the toilet at a truck stop.  Some of the rolls were acceptable, but others could have been skipped across a pond.  The waiter service was the only redeemable aspect of Ryan's.  However, how about adding some more cleaning people?  The buffet itself was littered with crumbs of food and muck.  The floors here were stickier than a day care center in the ghetto.  Skip this restaurant (or at least at this location) at any cost.
1	We stopped to eat at Ryan's one night after shopping all day at Concord Mills Mall.  Why?  We were hungry and Ryan's was the way to satisfy everyone.  They could pick whatever they wanted to off the buffet.  I don't visit buffets that often, but Ryan's has to be the grungiest one I've ever been to.  The food offerings were less and more bland than say Golden Corral, the place felt a little dirty, and the service was unspectacular.  It was okay for a fill-up and if you're not picky about taste or what you put into your body, but next time I think I'll pass and be a little more decisive about my restaurant choices in the area.
2	Ok if your not picky. Not the cleanest place. Price ok. Atmosphere is the typical all-u-can eat setting. Personally, I'd skip this one...
2	I only eat there when i don't know what to eat and when it's my only option.
1	If you have a hang over and need foood. Breakfast is goood and cheap, $5.99. You can stuff yourself and go back to bed.
