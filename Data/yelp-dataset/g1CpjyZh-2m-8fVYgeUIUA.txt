5	Dr Bellios and his staff are excellent. I found them to be both professional and practical in their approach. I received painless, high quality work on a very difficult root canal. Having eluded the dentist for far too long, my experience with Dr Bellios has me looking forward to each visit.
5	More then Comeptent.  Trustworthy.  Affordable. Looks to the best interest of the patients first.All in all, your best choice in the area.
5	I ended up in emergency care after my root canal here (unrelated to Dr. B's work!), and the dentists there were all crowded around my mouth, going on and on about how wonderful the crown looked and how they couldn't even tell it was a fake tooth.I've also encountered some (lack of) insurance problems, and Dr. B has worked with me on those to try to lessen the stress. Worth the drive to the south hills, for sure!Also, the office itself is relaxing. Some of the ceiling tiles in the rooms are clouds, just for an added touch :)And there is a photo book in the lobby of a medical mission/service trip Bellios took. He's just an actual decent human being, which is comforting when you're sitting in that dreaded chair!
