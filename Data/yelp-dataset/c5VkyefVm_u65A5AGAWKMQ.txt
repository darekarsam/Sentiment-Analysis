5	I love this place.  The food is great and not too expensive.  You get your moneys worth.
4	We wandered into this place while visiting the Hochelega neighborhood on our honeymoon. We wanted something off the beaten path and let touristy. I looked at the menu and it looked fabulous. They have a great little patio out front and the staff is very attentive and passionate about what they do (Plus, they had matching hats). For those visiting, I would suggest boning up on your French, the menu is on a chalk board and in French with no English translation. They are more than happy to answer your questions, but I did feel a little like an a$$hole asking them to. But, it really doesn't matter because whatever you order is going to be wonderful. I had homemade pasta with roasted mushrooms and my husband had a pork chop. It was probably the best meal I had in Montreal and we ate at a couple of very well written about places. They have a great cocktail list and they are more than happy to make suggestions about food pairings. It's pricey, one of the more expensive meals we had, but it was worth it. Very well done and plated beautifully.
