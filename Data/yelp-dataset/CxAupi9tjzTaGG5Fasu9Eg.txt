5	Sometime ago,I was looking for someone to service my Grandfather clocks in my home. After extensive research,I ran across these folks. I couldn't be happier with the result of their visitation. The knowledge they possess and the professionalism with which they practice,is impeccable! ALL of my clocks are running at peak performance;they even took the time to look at my "Black Forest" cuckoo clocks and passed on valuable advice as to how I should maintain them. I graciously appreciate their time,demeanor,and service! I wish no one else to service my clocks in the future! YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THESE FOLKS! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Thank-you so much for all that you have done to restore my precious time pieces!
5	I can not express my thanks & gratitude enough to everyone at Paul's Clock Repair.  I needed an Atmos clock repaired, which was given to me by my mother who had recently passed away.  I needed it done on a short time line since I live out-of-town and was leaving soon.  It is next to impossible to find anyone who can actually fix that type of clock especially anywhere close to where I live.  They were so accommodating and really really helped me out during a hard time.  Much thanks to Lisa for spending the time to teach my about the clock & how to take care of it and her dad for fixing it up!  My Atmos clock is now working great and looks wonderful on my mantle!
