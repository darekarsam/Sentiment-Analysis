1	Jiffy? I don't think so. 75 mins before my truck was in the bay, and I was the next in line the whole time. Please hire mechanic professionals, not sales reps.
1	This has to be the worst oil change place on the planet.  Horrible customer service high prices and overall a pain in the neck.  Seriously go anywhere but here.
