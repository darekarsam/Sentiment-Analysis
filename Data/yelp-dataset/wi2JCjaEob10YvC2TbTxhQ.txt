5	If you love corned beef and pastrami sandwiches this is the place for you. They have two downtown locations and the service is excellent. The food is delicious and the place is clean. Great for lunch or happy hour. The sell Dr. Brown soda which I absolutely love. The bread is fresh and the meat is lean! Good times!
4	This is a great cheap place to eat. If you want a quick lunch or a good dinner before the pens game go here. Quick service at the counter and you get great food for your money. I bought a pastrami and it was thick with meat. If you've gone to Sammy's that used to be in this location previously it is almost exactly the same it seems. You get a great sandwich for the money and is great that its near my college campus as it seems like you cant get a half decent sandwich without spending $13 dollars. I got a large pastrami, with pickle, a straub beer, and free popcorn for $8. You cant beat that.
5	Anytime I'm down by Consol there's only one place I go, Burg's! Yummy, quickly prepared food. Not fast food, think deli food. Although, my favorite is the all beef 1/4 pound hot dog! Killer prices too! 1/2 sandwichs 3.50-3.75 or get the whole thing for just 5.50-6 bucks. Wanna drink downtown, but not pay downtown prices? GO HERE! If you're going to Consol for anything, park next door, on the left, at the garage. It's usually 10 bucks for any event! That's 1/2 price from basically everything else and you're only 2-3 blocks from the venue. The bar is attached via hallway from the garage. It's a perfect one two punch to make whatever you've got going on a knockout!  Enjoy!
