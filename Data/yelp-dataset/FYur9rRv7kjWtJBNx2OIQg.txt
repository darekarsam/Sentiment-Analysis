5	Excellent bakery that also offers breakfast and lunch. All of their pastries are made in house with only the highest quality ingredients. My favorite sweet is their signature bars. They are absolutely to die for!!!!!!!!!!! Everything is just so good though. Especially their gourmet breakfast burritos and Turkey Ciabatta sandwich. Highly recommended :)
5	This place is delicious!  The turkey Brie sandwich is amazing!  Very friendly service every time we stop in. Will be back here a lot!
4	A unique and casual place where the food is excellent. Fresh and homemade. A big plus for me was the attitude of all who work in this sweet, small cafe. Where do you get good food and happy workers? THIS CAFE!!!
4	What a terrific addition to the area. Real scones. Beautiful pastries. Great soup. The chef made me olive rosemary loaves special order. Just fantastic.
5	Went for breakfast with the whole family...  Coffee is amazing, pastries are all fresh and delicious, and of all the breakfast items we ordered I couldn't pick a favorite because they were all so good!  The staff also couldn't be nicer.  Can't wait to go back.
