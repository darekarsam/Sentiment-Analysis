5	I came here with 5 of my friends and family.  We had so much fun!  Van Gogh's Starry Night was the challenge.  2 of the people from our group has done this painting thing before.  The rest of us...we are newbies.  It was easy to follow instructions to get paints.  Lots of space to work and move around.  Loved it!
5	My wife booked this with my 2nephews (21yrs old) and we rolled in with a couple bottle of fine wine and a nice sixer of IPA -- easy set up and a nice relaxed atmosphere -- instructor was very helpful and owner was super nice- what a great night!!! Got to paint a custom painting and drink it up -- different than your"average sat night " but soo cool ! I highly recommend !!
5	This was a wonderful night out! I have no art experience, but have seen these social paint nights popping up and really wanted to try one. So glad I picked Gogh Paint!  They have lots of paintings to choose from on their calendar, and the studio is bright & roomy. Plus the overhead music they play is fun. The instructor was awesome! She went out of her not only to give us all great basic instructions, but to come by and help any of us that might need it. At the end of the night we all had beautiful, but individual wildflower paintings. Can't wait to go again! Next time I will bring some friends. :D. If your looking for something fun, different, with a great souvenir worthy of framing at the end Gogh Paint should be on your list.
5	What a fun night!  Myself and 3 friends went in for a girls night out.  We laughed the entire time.  The instructor was easy to follow and we came out of there with some pretty awesome works of art!  The owner is very friendly and the space she has created is open and welcoming.  I hope to go back again soon!
