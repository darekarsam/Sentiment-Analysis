3	Its an okay club. If you are looking for some place to just dance out and chit chat with friends then this place is good. They have a small balcony overlooking the crescent street. Upstairs is VIP lounge which is nice to be a bit seperated from the dance floor below. And friendly staff. Good place
3	It was an alright club when I went there. Nothing to spectacular in my eyes.  The staff was very friendly
3	2nd floor club spot that can be pretty hoppin' when there are actually people.  There was a female downstairs luring people in by saying "great for dancing, awesome music and so many pretty people upstairs, come in!"   We always say yes to good music so we went on in.  When we got upstairs, there were a total of 5 people on the dance floor aside from us (2 couples and 1 guy who looked like he was practicing moves).  We laughed off the false advertising that there were "so many people," and proceeded to the dance floor anyway because we always have a good time.   Looks like we brought the party because people started piling in shortly after and the music kept going and going.  They won't let you into the DJ booth area (although the security guy followed me all the way upstairs until telling me this).   To request a song, you have to do some #-something and text the song to the DJ.  Very cool, but I just wanted to hear a song and that was a tad too much work.  Porch area with bar that offers prime viewing of Montreal's nightlife.  Great fun =D
