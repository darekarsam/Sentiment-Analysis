3	Stopped in for some grub after a visit to Lee's. I was disappointed to find out they no longer offer the Enchirito. Kee'erra was friendly and did offer a comparable substitution though. Overall it was right in line with other TB's I've visited. I will return.
4	Great customer service this morning.  The young man at the counter was quite pleasant.  Food is fresh and good.
5	Very good customer service after I waited like 3-5min before anyone knew I was waiting.
4	They are supper fast and really friendly here. Its fast food, but its hard to get good service.
1	impressed only by the fact the lady taking my order didn't seem to speak any English but did manage to cut me off each time I started talking to confirm my order wrong. I ordered one meal combo...ONE & she somehow figured out how to mess the whole thing up. it took me 3 minutes at the speaker to get her to understand what I actually wanted, which in actuality wasn't hard. just no sauce, that's all.
