5	Great Park with a good shaded picnic area! There's tennis court, a basketball court and a play area for the kids.
5	Ridgebrook Park is secluded amongst the many shady trees. Safe playground area far away from car traffic. Convenient, clean restrooms. Water feature,  splash pad, with gate and fenced area. Huge, green lawn area to run and play. Each time we visit, I meet kind and friendly people of all ages.
4	TLDR: street parking only; tennis/basketball court; closes at 11p; always someone around; kids' water "geyser"Ridgebrook park is part of a Summerlin community that offers it's residents escape from the big city. The park has several amenities including a tennis court, a walking trail, and a basketball court. The park closes at 11pm, which allows for post-dusk activities amidst the minimal cockroaches scurrying around at night. But let's face it, they gotta live somewhere right?I like driving the extra 10 minutes to exercise around the rich kids in a public setting...and because it's well lit. I appreciate the maintenance performed, except for the extensive bird poop. There's even those things for kids that shoot water out of the ground. I'm gonna call them geysers. Yeah, that sounds descriptive enough. Someone tell me what they are please. :)
