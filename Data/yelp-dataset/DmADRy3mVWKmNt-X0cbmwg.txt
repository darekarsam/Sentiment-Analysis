3	Went here once thinking that it would be similar to the Pare location at Namur metro. It was closer to home at the time so I figured I'd give it a try.The location was much more difficult to get to. No metro near by, had to take a car to get there. Service was odd. We were served by two children under the ages of fifteen who had been doing homework at one of the tables when we walked in.  We were the only one's in the restaurant.  We ordered or food and when it came out it was still very good quality Indian food (comparable to the other Pushap) however it was definitely not warm enough. We enjoyed the experience but it was odd that there were no adults to be seen!
3	Went here once long time ago, I did not know the place was exclusively vegetarian, but the food tasted really good.There was barely any service, and most of the restaurant's business consists of takeouts and deliveries. I would suggest takeouts instead of eating there.
5	Great Indian food! One of the best in Montreal.  Great selection of sweets.   What makes it unique is that the entire menu is vegetarian. We were 6 sharing a variety of dishes to go. A few found the spice level too much, but if you're not too sensitive to spice then it's perfect. It has become my go-to Indian take out place.
1	One of the worst Indian food restaurants I've been to.  You expect Indian food to have strong, explosive flavors, but theirs is very bland and flavorless.  Ordered the daily special thali.  Everything on the dish tasted the same.  Chick peas tasted like they just came out of a can, rinsed, and thrown on the plate.  No flavor.  The "curry" was lacking curry.
5	Excellent food and fantastic service. This restaurant has only gotten better since they broke from the "Pushap" brand and renamed themselves to "Les Delices de Punjab".
