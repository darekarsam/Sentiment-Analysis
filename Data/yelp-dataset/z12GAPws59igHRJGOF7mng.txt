5	Always nice employees. Great prices and decent food.
2	Well they gave us bacon instead of Canadian bacon. Bad start to new place.
5	Always friendly staff with hot bread sticks and pizza during busy times. I learned tonight this store treats their staff to an order of bread stick after their worked shift.  I don't know if this is all stores or just this location but great job franchise owner for taking care of the staff.
3	The pizzas are always ready on time. They have a special taste that my kids love. What I found out recently is that one topping is included in the $5.00 price!
4	Staff is always friendly and so we keep returning but I'm not sure if it is just my luck, or this locations policy but the "hot & ready" slogan doesn't really apply here. Every time, when it's busy or not busy, I will order our pizza, the cashier calls out my order and they then put the pizzas into the oven. They cook quick, in like 5-6 minutes, but I wouldn't consider this "READY" it's more like "ready to cook". When it's busy, the wait can get pretty frustrating. Especially with only a few chairs to sit on.
