3	super, super yummy food but what a horrible dining (service) experience.the waiter was so slow, and he did not seem well-trained. He may have been new though so Ill consider that too.I would recommend this place to others as the experience we had may not be the usual.Anyway, back to the food:We got insanely good pesto-pasta and a curry chicken pizza. The pizza had a lot of cheese and little to no sauce so I  got a side of sauce and took off some cheese.Leftovers made a great breakfast the next morning!
4	Everything was great about our experience.  All we wanted was a reasonable place to eat after traveling all day. While looking at the menu outside the friendly waiter came out and explained  the menu to us and invited us in. Since it was a Sunday evening we hadn't had any luck finding a place that was the right fit. Well this was it. Fast service and great pasta and all for a very reasonable charge.
1	watched the cook pull most of the ingredients for our meals out of a bag. The food was very bad, one of the worst meals in a long time. The waiter was very personable and was helpful but he couldnt save the food. You can do better almost anywhere else. DEFINATELY AVOID.
