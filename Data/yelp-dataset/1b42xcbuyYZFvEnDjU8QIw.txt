4	There is nothing like a walk in massage ... A relaxing surprise. I love it that I didn't need an appointment.
5	I have been going to Stress Away for months. I have redeemed several free massage awards as well from their frequent customer cards.  I have had severe muscle spasm that other modalities were not able to relieve, but the guys at Stress Away managed to get the KNOTS completely out, and all for a reasonable price.  Always pleasant and courteous as well.
