4	Large pool. Easy access to the Metro. Snack bar. Clean, spacious. Wasn't busy when I went on a Wednesday.
4	Large outdoor pool easy access by metro and sunny. Good place for families because of the beach-kind smooth slope into the water. Down side not much place to hide from the sun, food not allowed around the pool and sad plain concrete around the pool. Also for adults the pool can get a bit boring after a while. Kind of boring when not in the water. I think it's also some sort of a pick up spot - but of course, like any pick up spot in Montreal shy and quiet, you'll get back home the same way you came. If you come with kids there's also a nice green park nearby and thanks to the city of Montreal for the high parking fees as usual. Not much else to do around at the end of the day, if not chasing the marmots in the grass!
