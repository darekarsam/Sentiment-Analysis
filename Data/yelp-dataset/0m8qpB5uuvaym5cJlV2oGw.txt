5	One of the best hang-outs in Verdun!Their tea selections covers the entire globe, the service is informative and friendly, the decor and vibe of the place is nouveau hippy.A great spot to come by either by yourself and read a book and while away an hour or to come with friends after dinner or to just hang out!
3	Cosy ambiance, very polite, genial service, appears to be have an adequate selection of tea. I had the Indian chai blend with soy milk, a choice I was offered without asking. The tea was served in a little brown pot, with sugar on the side, good and hot. One can easily  just sit here, enjoy one's tea and while away a few hours.... it is such a relaxing place, with no pressure from the server. The only unpleasant surprise, was the bill.... $ 6.27  for a little pot  of tea. If you're on a budget you might want to consider taking your tea elsewhere.
4	The variety of teas available is simply amazing! And you can take your tea with nice little chocolate pieces or cakes. It's peaceful and relatively quiet, even if you have a big group talking in the small shop. One of my favorite tea spot on the island.
5	endroit relaxant, bon conseil en matiere de choix, un peu cher selon le the, mais je nai encore jamais ete decu! vaux le deplacement
5	Have a great tea, and sit in the sun. Or sit in the dark. Either way you'll relax, and you will have a great tea. This is a place to relax, this is a place to enjoy calmly.
