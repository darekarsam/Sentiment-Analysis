5	Their prices are fair, the staff is always friendly.  I like this place because you can try any flavor juice you want.  My wife and I go here twice a week and always leave smiling.  The staff can multi task very well.  Once you pick out the juice you want they will stop what they are doing and get you checked out.  Keep up the great work Evapology.  Customer for life!
5	Great place and house juice flavors. If you don't know about vaping and want to learn more this is the place for you. Also a great place to hang out and learn how to make coils or have some of the amazing staff make coils for you.
