2	Giving two stars is about the best compliment I can give this place. Walking in it was awkwardly quiet and empty (later on I could figure out why) but the space looked promising as it was large and had pool tables. The menu lacked some of the best tasting and most popular Dominican staples I expected to see. The food I did get was below average at best. The waitress who helped me was friendly and nice, but the owner shocked me with his lack of customer service. After asking the waitress to speak with the owner if he was available she came back and said the owner didn't want to speak to me. Not five minutes later he walks by me to turn down the volume to the TV and ignores my presence as I offer a greeting. I had to wonder if I had ever met him before and had upset him in some way! This was a terrible disappointment and I would recommend that no one tries this place looking for Dominican food. It would leave an impression that is unfair to the Dominican culture, and I am Dominican.

While I was waiting for my friend to arrive, I order some beef empanadas, which were a really nice starter and pretty cheap. For my entree, I ordered some fajitas...very savory and delicious! My friends ended up sharing some plantains and yuca fries. The plantains were so juicy and tasty that we ended up ordering a second batch. Our waitress, who was very friendly, suggested we try yuca fries and she was so right about them. They came with a nice garlic dipping sauce, which tasted excellent with or without the sauce. Writing this review definitely has me craving some more! I would come back again.
