4	Part 1 (2 stars):This is hopefully part 1 of the review. And I hope I can give them extra stars this afternoon.Dropped of our clothes from our first 3 weeks of vacation (almost everything we have with us) on monday morning. So far so good. Picked it up yesterday afternoon. Reasonable price, but......I'm missing a big portions of my clothes. And hopefully by coincidence: primarely brand clothes (A&F, Bjorn Borg). And that's only what we are aware of. I didn't count my sockes and underwear. So it good be more.And yes, I also own clothes now that are not mine. Not my taste, not my size and, well, I just wan't my own clothes back. Let's hope it will be solved this afternoon for we'll be leaving LV soon......Part 2 (4 stars):The lady was already expecting us. So, I again have my own, clean clothes making me a satisfied customer.(Note: I'm no native speaker, please forgive the spelling and grammar errors).
4	Been going here for years anytime I need my suit pressed and with a 1day turn around I visit Anna. Friendly serbice and they do a food job at a reasonable price$ 9.75 a suit
5	This place is the best. I have been going here for years and they go out of their way to do it right. Always great service. One day it was raining and my wife pulled up outside, the owner saw her and brought my dry cleaning out to her car!! Now that is service.
