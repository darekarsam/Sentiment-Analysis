4	This place is a (pl)treasure chest. It is filled with all my favourite beers, ciders, wines and spirits. This being an independent seller it stocks the best of the known alcoholic drinks known to man. (don't fully quote me on that)We visited last night on a 'laddie' whisky tasting organised by Yelp and I had a good browse through the shop. Side by side I found Iduns Cider and BrewDog. Yippi-kayee. As mentioned I found the selection extensive and I was explained that the owners will gladly try to order what cannot be found in the shop. I have made a (part) promise to stop scouring the internet for difficult to find brands and first try here instead as I will be supporting independant retailers doing so.

4	I appreciate any place that aids in my ever constant quest to be a lazy, lazy human.Not only does this place have an exceptional selection of craft brew, including a handful of my favourite hard-to-find Belgiums...Not only is there a wall, a massive, massive wall of wine with the folks knowledgable enough on hand to traverse it...Not only do they carry Fentimans' Alcoholic Ginger Beer (which is delightful)...But they also manage to stock a decent little freezer full of Cook's frozen entrees... which in my defense, are a tasty alternative to the microwavable slush you can find at most other local stores. For a single gal like myself, a one stop shop for a ginger beer, a nice bottle of vino and a steak and red wine pie is basically the holy grail of lazy weekday evenings.A happy find in the neighbourhood and a good place to poke your head in, if you're seeking above average libations.
