4	Anyone that has ventured to Tacos Mexico after a day of rock climbing at Inner Peaks, is probably sad to see it closed.  However, now in its place is Caribbean Delights. New, welcoming and lively owners serve up some awesome food. These Dominican-transplants from NJ are bringing homestyle Latin Cuisine.  On the menu are foods from Cuba (a real deal cuban sandwich!), Dominican Republic, Mexico and more.  Much better than Punta Cana. Not fancy at all but the food is great and filling. Me and my kids loved the roast pork,  rice and pinto beans which were full of flavor! Interestingly, the menu changes daily which is a nice way to keep thing fresh and exciting...buena suerte!
3	Not the same as first time. My boys (Foodies in training) were disappointed ("Daddy, the rice isn't the same").  The rice and beans were missing the burst of flavors from our initial meal. However, these are really nice people and will give them another try.

4	That's some good food!
4	08/22/2014: I read here this restaurant was closed, so I checked it out when I went to Matthews today. It is OPEN for business and tho hard to see from the street, because it is in the 'elbow' of the small strip mall, I went and saw it OPEN.
