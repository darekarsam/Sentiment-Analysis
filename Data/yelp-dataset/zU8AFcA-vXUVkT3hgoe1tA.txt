4	I like Gray's, especially since the bookstore on campus really sucks.  I reccomend going to Gray's for your text books, etc if you are a UNCC student.  The books here are pretty much the same price, but the staff is much more considerate and helpful.  Plus there is a parking lot right in front of the store.  This is also a good place to get school supplies and UNCC stuff.
