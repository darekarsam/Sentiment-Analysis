5	If you want furniture made out of solid wood, this is one of the few places to get it. Its semi-custom, in that you get to choose a combination of design, wood, hardware, and finish. They have a number of styles, ranging from traditional to more contemporary. Of course, this doesn't come cheap.I haven't yet actually purchased from them yet, but every time I've gone in to browse, the staff has been friendly, helpful, and not at all pushy.
3	The furniture is of excellent quality and craftsmanship.  Beautiful, too.  Many options of wood types and colors.  The sales man/manager of the Champaign branch was kind and accomodating.  I'm very happy with the purchase.When I tried to contact the sales man/manager after the sale, looking for some advice on how to repair a ding I made when transporting the piece, I couldn't get a response after multiple attempts.
5	This is great furniture. Bought a coffee table today that was reasonably  priced and excellent quality. As others have said, the store owner is both helpful and not pushy at all. I recommend furniture from Simply Amish in Champaign.
