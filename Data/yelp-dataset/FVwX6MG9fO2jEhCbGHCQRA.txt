4	I was a walk in patient fro this studio, looking for a dentist near my home.I am very pleased with the care I have recieved to date.Doctor Sweet spent all the time neccessary to answer any questions I may have had. The work was terrific and Diana who assits and runs the office is great.I could not be more comfortable in a dental and look forward to a long relationship with Dr Sweet and his staff.
5	I've been a patient of Tempe Dental Studio since August 2014 for Invisalign treatment. This is my first adult orthodontic experience, and Dr. Richins and his staff have been exceptional! Lori, the office manager, is great at explaining all payment options and handles insurance inquiries quickly. They even offer a "text to confirm" your appointment reminder a few days before your visit. The office is clean, and the individual treatment rooms are well-sized. His dental assistants are friendly and welcoming and were able to explain what to expect over the course of the Invisalign treatment.After my initial consultation, Dr. Richins was able to take my impressions and get the Invisalign process started. He is very thorough and professional - making sure the molds for my Invisalign trays were set and ready to be sent off. It only took about a week for my first set of trays to arrive! I'm about halfway through my Invisalign treatment and have seen a tremendous improvement in my teeth and smile! I can't wait to see the end result and would definitely recommend Dr. Richins and Tempe Dental Studio!
