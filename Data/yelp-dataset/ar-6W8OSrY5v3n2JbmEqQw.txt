3	I really want to leave 4 stars for this place. It's new.. it seems family run.. the people working there were oh so nice. I was just disappointed in my sandwich. They use boar's heads meats and cheeses, but they don't carry any of the more "exotic" delish cheeses like havarti. Can't fault them for that. I had a turkey & cheese sandwich on a hero with garlic spread. Bread was blah. Out of a bag, boring, not tasty at all. Garlic spread was all mayo and no flavor (I'd prefer to see more of an aioli type spread, but that's me being picky). The only yummy thing about it was the turkey - which I can buy at Smith's for less. At $7.99/sandwich (with no sides!), I just expect a little more pizazz or taste. Next time I'll try an Italian sub and hopefully it will be more exciting. The fiance had some of the warm food - chicken cordon bleu with veggies and potatoes. He loved it. They also carry bfast and whatnot so I'm interested to try some of their other foods.
