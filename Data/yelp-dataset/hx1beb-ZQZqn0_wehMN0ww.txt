4	A popular skate park, always lots of kids here. Kids bring their inline skates, scooters, & BMX bikes. There's plenty of grass for picnics or soccer games, and a nice playground for toddlers. My only complaint would be that the bathrooms are always closed due to vandalism. Best to "go" before you leave the house to come here. Also the neighborhood surrounding the park is ghetto, but I haven't really seen gang activity or anything like that, just the occasional group of rowdy skater teenagers, but nothing that has ever made me feel unsafe taking my kids there.
1	First of all I wouldn't even give it a one star I would give it a - star.When approaching the restroom children had filled balloons with urine and threw them at people. When the child's parents are conforonted they denied responsibility and the group they were part of chased us from the park with threating language.
