3	If it wasn't for the shady characters in and out of this place I would give it a 4 star...no doubt.  Not much to say here, just a quick "stab and grab" type place where the shelves are lined with discontinued product and out of date goods.  Why give it 3 stars you ask?  I don't know, I just feel like the place has good karma.  Seems to be run by a very blue collar group of Asian people that are as friendly as they come and make me feel like family when I walk in.  Don't come here looking for name brands, come here just to get the bare essentials and that is it.  Oh, and don't come after dark...or at least I probably wouldn't.
3	Watch your back. Shady McGrady. But has some default convenience store stuff if you live in that hood.
4	There is really nothing shady about Southside. I've been going there since 2005 and have never encountered anything other than neighborly behavior. The store is clean, stocked with basics and even some "thank god I don't have to drive to get that random thing" things; name brands, generally not expired.  I'd give it a five except the perishable items are questionable. The staff is great which makes paying a slightly higher price for the convenience a pleasure.
