5	Don's is my place.  Outstanding new humidor with an incredible selection of fine cigars.  A nice little sitting place to plop and enjoy a stick with friendly folks.  All the supplies you need and a separate lounge for members.  Come by and see the new location.
5	Ask Lee for a suggestion. I wish we had places like this in Washington or California!  A great cigar store/lounge where the regulars are friendly and you can sit, smoke a cigar and shoot the breeze with great prices, selection and company.
5	Mr. Lee is a great man and fantastic business owner.  I have been doing business here for years and he always treat you like a VIP no matter if its your first time through the door or your 1000th.  The selection of cigars is great with a good rotation and the entire staff knows their cigars. Give them some criteria on what you like or what you're looking for and they usually nail it on the first try.I stop in at least once a month to buy something, just because I love the way I'm treated as a customer.
5	I'm from Tucson so it was my 1st time here but this place was highly recommended. Lee was very welcoming and his prices were great! I will def. Be back!The only negative I could say was that Lee was wearing a ScumDevils shirt.BEARDOWN!!!
5	Mr. Lee is very knowledgable and helpful as you pick your cigars. He keeps his humidor at a great humidity - many around Phoenix over compensate and make them too humid. I always know I'm going to have a good experience.
