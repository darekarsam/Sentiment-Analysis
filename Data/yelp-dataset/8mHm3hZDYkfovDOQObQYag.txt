2	Three appointments  with a wait over an hour each before seeing doctor one was one hour and 20 mins I walked out  didn't get a call afterwards or any kind of apology guess it biz as usually there no mas
1	Wait time is awful! Always an hour or more. I walked out of my last appointment before even seeing Dr. Mannino because the wait had been too long. I've been coming here for over 10 years but now I think it's time to move on. No follow up on labs, no appointment reminders, not professional at all!
4	Awesome Provider !!! He's been my personal physician for over 13 years and I trust him implicitly !!!  They have a Great staff of knowledgable and friendly nurses and medical assistants.   The Doctor is clinical yet he is an absolutely responsive care-giver !!!  He's a blessing and he cares.
4	Dr Mannino has been our primary provider for close to twenty years. Over time, we've seen his team and his own approach evolve and grow.He's a good dianostician and is conservative and caring in his treatment approach. We've away been treated with consideration by the staff and FPN.Yes, sometimes the waits can be pretty long, but it seems Doc takes more time with a patient, and the schedule slips. Have patience.
1	Currently waiting to see the PA for about 45 min now (after waiting 25 just to get called back) and listening to socializing and complaining about the flood waters outside of the room I'm sitting and waiting in as if my time isn't valuable. This is not acceptable! 8:30am appt, now leaving at 10:00!
