5	Great value for the food. Once you get to know the staff after a few visits, you'll even start having fun while you wait for your food to sizzle in front of you. I like their various forms of pasta, but I also really recommend their pizza menu. The first time I tried their veggie pizza I was so delightfully surprised that it has become my IT item on the menu.
