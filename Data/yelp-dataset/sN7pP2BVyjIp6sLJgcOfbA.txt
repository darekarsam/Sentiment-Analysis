4	Really patient staff & doctor! Thank you for taking such good care of my cat!
4	Great veterinary clinic, this location and the one at Mt Island as well. I use this one specifically for boarding and spa services for my Golden and they know us by name though it might have been a few months since the last visit. The vets are all super nice and if they are booked when you are trying to get in they'll work with you to get you in at the Mt Island location a few miles down the road (great people there too!). Boarding is inexpensive at $22/day-night which allows your pet play time outside. They have a large outside play area! I've been on the wellness plan for 2 years which includes 2 visits for all shots, sentinel through the year, 2 spa days and 2 boarding days.
1	I do not recommend. Let's just say my experiences were not good. My animals have received much much much better care elsewhere. They were diagnosed with conditions at other vet and treated aggressively which was never done at paw creek. Dr CArnevale is rude to staff and total bond euthanized several healthy animals that lived there due to taking up space and using resources. Do not recommend AT ALL.
