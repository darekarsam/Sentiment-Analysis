4	A great new place specializing in rotisserie chicken at the far east end of the Plateau. A big, open, bright, and beautiful space serving delicious food and cocktails. A group of us shared two whole chickens, which came with fries and coleslaw. I dare say it's the best rotisserie I have had in Montreal...very friendly service and casual atmosphere. Will definitely be returning to try their chimichurri....
4	Finally great rotisserie chicken in Montreal! Absolutely delicious! They don't have spicy sauce, but their chicken gravy is just perfect. We also loved the poutine, untraditional, made with roasted baby potatoes, onion and chicken, a meal I would come back for. I also liked very much my endive and apple salad. Perfect choice of drinks, the Bloody Caesar is a must try. The list is impressive, including extensive Bourbon choices and nice beer selection. We felt very comfortable in our booth and the restaurant feels spacious with its nice layout. The service is a little bit immature, I'm sure the girls will learn with practice.The trip to the east end of Mont Royal street was definitely worthy!
1	I must express my utter distain for the way my family and I were treated when we entered the restaurant and refused entry because of our baby. We double checked Resto-Mtl and the Facebook page and there was no indication that it was a exclusively a bar (which does not allow children) and not a resto-bar which does. The hostess was rude and did not show any empathy for the fact that we had drove over an hour to eat at this venue because until now had heard good things. I'm sorry but as a result I strongly do not recommend this restaurant to my friends and family and to other people with small children including newborns. If possible I would give it zero stars.
