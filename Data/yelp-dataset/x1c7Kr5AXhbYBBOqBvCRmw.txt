5	Good, fast, cheap!  What more could you ask for.
2	Where's the meat?" This place used to be a regular for me for years, until one day I ordered hunan chicken take-out. Bottom line, meat was almost non exsistent. Mostly veggies but litle tiny strips of chicken I could barely find. Very skimpy. I called to inquire if they mistakenly gave me a veggie dish, and I was they pre-measure the amount of meat in their dishes. Went to another chinese restaurant that was a little cheaper AND with HUGE chunks of chicken!. Since then, I have decided since I like meat I haven't gone back.
5	Great fast Chinese food like you would find in NYC - try it. Cheap & fresh, love this place.
4	For the money they are THE BEST in Harrisburg... I go there when ever  I am looking for a good lunch.
5	This place is excellent!  Really good food and cheap prices!  My favorite Chinese food!
5	Great food! Fast delivery and it was still warm. I tried the egg rolls which were yummy. The curry chicken was pretty good, though I had to use some extra hot sauce to make it spicy enough for me. I also tasted the hot and sour soup, which was full of tofu, mushrooms, pork strips, and a couple other things, but again, I had to add hot sauce. It was by far the best Chinese food I've ever had delivered.
4	Great Chinese food. Anything you order with shrimp has large, tasty shrimp. None of the small shrimp you get at other places. Everything on the menu is good, you can't go wrong.
4	Good quality food, better than Chong Chin across the street.
