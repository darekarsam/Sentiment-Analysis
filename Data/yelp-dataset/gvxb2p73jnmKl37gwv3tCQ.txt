5	I go in here almost everyday for a diet Coke. They give free drinks to players and have the best staff in this part of town. The staff has been the same for years.
1	Horrible car wash...... took 40 minutes  and it did not come out clean to a point they have someone washing it by hand before  you  go into the machine and drying it when you get out..... what is the point of having the machine  if it does not clean..... very unhappy
