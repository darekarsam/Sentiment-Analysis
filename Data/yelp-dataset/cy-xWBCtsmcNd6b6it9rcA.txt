3	Cheerful little downtown sandwich shop with paninis, some prepared salads, quiche, coffee, and some breakfast foods. There is a refrigerator case with beverages and perhaps five tables up front. They were friendly and patient. even though we didn't speak French well. It's not a destination by any stretch of the imagination, but it's got to be better than the other chains around this block - Burger King etc.
3	Very cool little cafe with both indoor and outdoor seating (at least in the summer) right by a nice fountain... nicely located between Chinatown and Old Montreal. There are many drinks, coffees, yogurts and sandwiches.We had coffee, yogurt and a Mediterranean wrap and it was all excellent and the staff was super friendly. A nice cool place to enjoy a beer before heading out to explore either the tiny Chinatown or the great old city.
3	Coffee was pretty good.  Patio was spacious. Nothing else to say. I'd drop by if I was in the area and needed a coffee and a place to sit down on a nice summer day.
4	Great sandwiches, camembert yum!
5	We ventured into this cafe on a whim as it just happened to be on the way to the metro. I must say this was one of the best places I ate at during my trip. The food was amazing, the atmosphere was upbeat, and the location could not be better!
3	I came here to finish a paper. I sat out on the terrace which was quite nice but the wifi connection was terrible. I dont know if it was from sitting outside or what. There is also a fire station next door which may bother some.I had a chai latte. It was mediocre.
2	I popped in here when I had a bit of time to kill waiting for the STM photo studio to open. Place is clean and staff is friendly. COFFEE IS WEAK. No flavor and hyper-watered down. Skip this place unless you're just looking for wifi.
