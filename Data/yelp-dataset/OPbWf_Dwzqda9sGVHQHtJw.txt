1	This place sucks. It reflects the ghetto area surrounding it. The cashiers are loud and annoying and don't have a trace of customer service etiquette  And I'm pretty sure some of them actually bring their kids to work with them...expecting customers to babysit them. There is almost always some weird, drunken derelict sitting near the restrooms. And the teenagers that hang around are always talking trash about other people they know.
1	Filthy from corner to corner . Went to the restroom to wash my hands and backed out due to the smell. Customer service is pathetic.
2	I agree with the previous comment. This place is old and dirty!! I can't say anything wrong about the service because I don't really care about that ... Lol
3	It's Taco Bell - nothing special. Food is okay, drive through is fast and friendly.
2	It is mexican by a stretch of the meaning.  The orders are always wrong!  Have to check before you leave thw place and hold up the drice thru.   The food is wdible and cheap.   Good for a bsic burrito or such.
3	There seems to be a different day shift manager since my last review. I have held off on updating my review to give things a chance and see what happened. I have been pleasantly surprised with the overall cleanliness of the restaurant and improvement in customer service.
