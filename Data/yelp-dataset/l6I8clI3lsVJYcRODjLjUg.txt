1	Person who delivered the pizza was amazing! Super sweet older man! Unfortunately, the order was wrong. I ordered extra chicken and there was no chicken at all. I called the store, person on the phone was ridiculously rude! Well we are slammed so what do you want me to do? Was his response and attitude! Wtf? It would be 45 mins to get the correct order so he credited me a large pizza for next time. I can careless for the free pizza. To be honest, it would have been nice to be treated with some damn respect. You got the order wrong not me! Also the track your order ? Isnt the pizza checked for quality before it leaves so why was the order wrong! Seriously! Get it together!
