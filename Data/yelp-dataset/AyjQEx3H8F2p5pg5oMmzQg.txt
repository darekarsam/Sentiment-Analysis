5	Amazing! Seriously the best massage I've ever had in my life. I've been to many top rated spas and massage therapists and Dana Marie put them all to shame. She knows how to work out muscle pains and aches with talented hands. You leave feeling rejuvenated both in body and spirit. It is amazing experience to be had.
5	Had the best massage of my life today! I am not even joking, I have had many of them and no one has taken better care of me. Thank you so very much Dana for the amazing massage and yes I will be coming back every month.
5	Love Love Love getting a massage by Dana! She creates such a deep connection when I'm on the table it becomes very easy to open up to her, body wise, as well as spirit.  I usually prefer male therapists, but Dana is the exception for me. For sure one of the best therapists in the Valley!! Please do yourself a favor, and book at least an 80 min with Dana, and be prepared for some amazing massage and energy work!!
5	The most important quality in a massage therapist is their diagnostic ability. Finding someone like Dana Marie, who is extremely proficient in listening to a patient's description of pain or discomfort and then being able to identify a treatment approach is why I continue to come back. She is really intuitive. I can't recommend her enough.
