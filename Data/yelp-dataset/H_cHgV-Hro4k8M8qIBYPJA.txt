5	Amy is truly amazing!!! I hired her to help coordinate my wedding and it was the best decision I made in regards to my wedding. She was available to meet multiple times before the wedding in order to go over what I wanted and what she would need to do the day of the wedding. Amy even visited the wedding site months before so she would have a better idea of where things were. Then Amy completely coordinated the rehearsal. She was a million times better and more organized than the wedding coordinator the venue provided.The day of my wedding was a dream and ran completely smooth (even though it rained!). Amy was organized down to the tiniest detail. She even made sure I drank water and had food in my stomach. She is an expert at coordinating others. Amy had no problem directing the other vendors and my decorating helpers.Amy, I cannot say thank you enough! You took all of the stress off of me and I was able to enjoy my big day! I recommend Amy and Adam to ANYONE!!! They are the best and know what they are doing!
5	I almost cried after watching one of Life's Story Studios wedding boutique films! They can do weddings, bar/batmitzvahs, portraits, corporate headshots, promo videos; pretty much you name it they can do it . Even though he's a religious son of a bitch, I had fun working with him and I will always have fun working with him and Amy. For 2 hours we laughed our butts off getting the amazing images that we did. He let me be who I am which is a crazy nut.
