5	This is an excellent urgent care office to go to if you have a need for immediate care. I went there with a severe sinus infection and cold, the front desk was efficient and quick. It is a very friendly office and the Physician Assistant that I saw there was kind, knowledgeable, and a good listener. She diagnosed my problem quickly, asked me if I wanted an additional test for strep (versus just giving me one) and provided me with the appropriate medication. Being new to the area they also gave me a great doctor referral for a general practitioner. I am well on my way to recovery and never had such a great experience (if that is possible) at an urgent care in California or North Carolina. I would not recommend anywhere else, great hours 7 days a week.
5	Nurses at the front counter are a little spacey and slow but otherwise this urgent care is just wonderful. I asked the front nurse for some tips on preventing an infection I keep dealing with and she just looked at me blank and said she didn't know. I'm sorry but you're a nurse, how the hell do you work here and not have ANY advice to give me? Thank goodness the doctors and nurses in the back know what's going on. In fact they're some of the nicest I've worked with. Definitely go here if you need to, they're some of the most hospitable and friendly doctors who go above and beyond the call of duty to help.
1	Awful awful awful!!!!  I have never experienced such RUDE nurses or doctor in my life. I will never go back here again. I'm not sure how they have received positive reviews.
1	If I could give zero stars I would.  Waited almost a half hour for my number to be called to even be registered, but that never happened.  I ended up leaving and going to cvs clinic instead.  Won't ever go back there.
