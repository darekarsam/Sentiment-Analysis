5	I'd be at this place all the time even if it weren't located inside my favorite gym. Healthy, fresh, low calorie, low fat breakfasts, lunches, smoothies, etc. Every menu item shows calorie content, fat content, protein, carbs, etc - and they keep it low. The staff - every last one of them - is unfailing upbeat and friendly.Did I mention how tasty everything is?
4	Good low cal smoothie. Very nice salads.  Kids love it too!
4	I am a big fan of Life Cafe. The staff is ever so friendly and the shakes are great. I usually pop in Life Cafe for a healthy lunch after my 9:45 butt-kicking with James (Barbell Strength on Fridays). The FastFuel Complete is amazing and full of protein. Oh, did I mention that each menu item lists its total calories, protein, carb, and fat content right next to the price? Love it!
3	Life Cafe is full of yummy, healthy options after your workout.  My typical routine is to grab a smoothie after my morning workout and before heading to work.  I've been know to grab a breakfast wrap now and then too.  The service is friendly.  Sometimes a little slow, but hey, healthy fresh food takes time.  A great option for breakfast or lunch!  Bring the kids, spend the day at the pool and grab a bite - make a day out of it!  You all had fun, they're tired and full and all it one place!
3	The food here is so-so. Nothing is great. Healthy indeed. If you like warm meat with your salad you have to ask them to warm it when you order. Otherwise, everything is straight out from fridge. Honestly, I've had better salad at McDonald. I wouldn't get the food here unless I'm stuck waiting around. Price wise? Affordable, if not a lil much. A bed of salad without meat can be $5-6 alone.
