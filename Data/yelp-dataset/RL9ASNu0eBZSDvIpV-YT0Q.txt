4	This is a little breakfast place close to the gay village in Montreal. It's a great little place with a nice menu for breakfast and lunch. It is quite small and very busy on weekends so expect a bit of a wait.I have never had anything off of the lunch menu but the breakfasts are great. I have enjoyed many items off the menu including a delicious ham and leek omelet and a few types of Eggs Benedict. Their potatoes have tasty herbs on them and they serve all the breakfasts with a tiny bowl of apple sauce. The toast is also great, not made from regular bread. Its made from delicious buttery white or brown artisan type bread.  One major complaint is the service is not consistent. A few times it's been great, coffee always full, and meals served promptly with a smile. One time, however, it was horrible! My meal was fine but it took so long to arrive that the hollandaise sauce of my girlfriend's eggs benedict had time to form a film over the top and was ice cold before getting to the table. The waitress asked if we wanted a new one or reheated, I insisted on a new one (reheated hollandaise...ew!). Maybe it was just a bad day for this waitress.
1	Cute little place. Unfortunately that is about all that's positive. There were  6 people in the place mid day and it took 35 mins to get two omelets. The cappuccinos ($4.25) were weak, bitter and cold.The 3 cheese omelet and mushroom omelet were dry, burnt and tasteless, lacking the cheese and or mushrooms.How can you mess up a omelet?The homefries were burnt and not edible.Expensive at $38 for two omelets & two coffees.So many better places in the area, no need to spend your money or time here.
