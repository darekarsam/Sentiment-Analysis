5	Warm, inviting atmosphere. Fantastic music playing on the stereo. Kind staff. And delicious, simple, low-priced food. If I lived in Montreal this would be my haunt.
2	We got here around noon and most of the baked goods were gone. Matter of fact there was only one croissant left, no chocolate croissants either. I just had a small latte, but it was a boring dreadfully dead cup. Aside from the interior decoration of books, mostly French, and a piano; I don't see why I would come here again. Once is enough. There isn't even wifi.
