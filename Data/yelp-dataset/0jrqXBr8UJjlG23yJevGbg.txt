5	This place is incredible. Hands down most delicious  "fast food" Chinese restaurant in the East Valley. Wow! I ordered the 2 item combo and I got a heaping portion of Orange and General Tso's chicken, white rice, chow mien, and an egg roll for $5.95. I went here at 9:15pm on a Sunday also. I would recommend this place to anyone and am happy to say that I will be eating here much more often.
5	I so love it... Great food nice and fresh
5	Love this place this is mine and my husband's absolute favorite Chinese restaurant except for a place out in Scottsdale that we like a lot too. The food has always been fresh every time we've gone they don't cook it until you order it very consistent we've been going here for years and have never had anything to be upset about also their dining room is very clean. Oh yeah and they deliver
