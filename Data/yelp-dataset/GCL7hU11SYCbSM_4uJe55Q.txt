3	Tip: nachos here are bomb, yes gas station nachos. When you want care less about your health, load up on nacho and chili cheese. Also tamales in green chili and horchata at this location.
2	Place is alright. I was in a hurry and needed gas, but if you get Chevron, you're better off going to the one on Kyrene or Rural on Baseline. A lot cheaper compared to this one.
3	Corner gas station that has easy paying at the pump. If your hungry you can run on in and grab some food. This is a car wash location but beware it washes well but does not dry your car properly. The 60 seconds of air seems to not blow hard so your car rides away soaking wet leaving water stains. Basically defeats the purpose. The cheapest wash is $4.99. Your better off going to the car wash and doing an exterior only for $1.00 more.
