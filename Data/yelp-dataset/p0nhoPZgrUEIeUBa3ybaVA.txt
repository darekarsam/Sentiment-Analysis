5	Newer shop, great artists, clean and trustworthy.  The owners have over 15+ years experience in the business.  If you are looking for a custom piece, this is your place.  I personally get tattooed by Steve Rieck who is not only an amazing artist but aims to please.  Friendly people and great customer service.
5	Been tattoo'd by Gianni for years and this shop and all that are in it are nothing but an extension of his greatness. Be smart get a great tattoo from this shop.
5	Giani has done amazing work on me for a while now. He's got talent like no other! I won't go to anyone else! His shop is awesome and he has alot of great artists. Thank you G! See ya soon for some more tattoo therapy! :)
5	Broken Dagger Tattoo is a newer shop, but one of the best in Las Vegas. Every artist in the shop is fantastic and does great work. You can follow each of them on instagram and see all of the fantastic art. I have been going to Gianni Russo for quite a few years now and he is one of the best I have ever seen. Great people, fantastic shop, and good prices lead to an amazing tattoo experience. Go now and see for yourself or follow them on instagram @brokendaggertattooparlor
5	This is a stylish and professional tattoo shop with talented and friendly tattoo artists. Bundy is a creative genius who excels at sleeves and other large pieces.
5	Beautiful shop! Clean friendly. Got a half sleeve by Bundy amazing artist fast and clean.
5	Nothing but straight cleanliness, professionalism, and actual ARTISTS at this tattoo shop! !!! The vibe to this brand new shop is very inviting and comforting to all. I personally get tattooed by 2 of the 7 artists here,  but because of the quality of work and overall talent that the other artists have, I would be down to be tattooed by any of them! !! If your looking for amazing prices and talent,  all you gotta do is walk thru the doors....
5	Absolutely love this shop. I have 3 tattoos done by Steve & one of them is a cover up. Everyone there is very talented in their own way. Very professional, positive vibes, & good music. Nothing but good things to say about this shop!!
4	This shop came highly recommended and they didn't disappoint. The staff greeted us as soon as we entered the door. That's always a plus, otherwise I take my business else where. Ecceltic looking shop on the inside, but it's very clean. Steve did a nice elemental ambigram for my daughter. This is where I'll come from now on in Vegas...finish up my "bakers dozen" for my tats.Big Daddy O
5	I haven't used Yelp in a long time but I wanted to make sure that I made sure everyone knew just how awesome Jake is at this shop. I had my cousins in town visiting from Napa and we all decided to visit this shop (partly because I knew they are huge animal lovers and I work with rescue in the valley) and get some work done.  First of all, the shop is so clean, all the artists take this very seriously and take their time to clean their stations completely. They pay attention to detail and all the staff really helps you in the direction you want to take with your tattoo. Jake tatted me, and my two cousins. He gave us a MORE than fair price and his lines are seriously off the hook. We all three received awesome tattoo's but in the process my mother also got a tattoo by another artist Lilly. She was fantastic too and really gave my mother a prefect first tattoo! This shop is friendly, very relaxed and funny as hell. I am totally in love with my tattoo and so are my cousins.
5	Just came back from broken dagger tattoo got 2 pieces from Steve. He was great,super friendly  and great work! Am going back to finish my back!  Wouldn't go any where else! Thanks Steve
5	1st time experience. Shop very upscale and cozy. Never seen a tattoo shop that was so jazzy as this. Steve was very professional and detailed. I love my tattoo
5	Steve is great!!!!!! Going back to have my back done with his great designs! Thanks much! 10 stars from me!!!!!
5	Amazing artist, very talented, and more than knowledgeable on their craft. Very satisfied with my tattoos and my families. As well as I have referred many friend here who have as well loved their tattoos and are continuing clients now. Def recommended to any one looking for new art. Very welcoming shop!
5	The Best tatoo shop in Las Vegas!! Multiple talented artist in the shop an highly recommended!!
5	Very nice, clean and friendly! It was my birthday and I needed a cover up bad, jake did an AMAZING JOB at covering what I had up. Everyone at the shop are amazing at what they do. I highly recommend everyone to check this place out! I can't wait to go and get my next tattoo done by jake! (:
5	The cleanest shop I've been to in Vegas, tony has been working on my sleeve and it is absolutely breathtaking the works that come from this shop,   Every artist has there own style and eats sleeps and breathes tattoos,   No piece too small or too big, check them out.
5	Was referred to Gianni and ended up with Jake. Awesome experience with both guys! I'm not "into" tattoos and needed a little cover up so this is a little out of my comfort zone. Both guys made me feel very comfortable and what jake designed was better than my expectations. Love this place!
5	What can we say? Wow! That's what. Although I did not get a tattoo, my wife did so I'm writing this review for her. Lily was an absolutely awesome artist. You can tell how she values her work by the amount of detail and time she spends on her pieces to make sure they're just right. She not only takes great care of the pieces she works on but she also makes sure her customers are happy. One of the coolest tattoo artist my wife has gotten a tattoo from. A definitely recommend for her unique style and workmanship!
5	I came here because of the great reviews on Yelp. My first tat in Vegas & overall a good experience. The shop is very clean & nice location too. It's not in a busy area like on the strip. Steve did a great & fast job on my tat.  Would come here again if I'm feeling spontaneous :)
5	Went into Broken Dagger and had a tattoo in mind I wanted to get. I was worried of the accuracy and outcome of the tattoo. This was my first tattoo and didn't know what to expect in terms of pain and overall experience. My artist was Jake and he was fantastic. My piece took nearly 6 hours .. maybe a bit more. I was welcomed in and the experience ended up being great. Getting a tattoo wasn't as bad as I thought and the piece on my forearm is well worth the pain that comes with getting one. The shop is clean, and feels like a tattoo shop should. There is art all over the walls and employees are passionate about what they do. We changed a few things from the original design which enhanced the overall look and made it stand out. I was very pleased with the work and the conversations while the tattoo was going on were great. I wasn't very concerned with price but once finished I was pleased with the overall cost and will defiantly be returning for more work. It took me 10+ years to get my first tattoo and now I am hooked.
5	I would say that my experience here is one of my best anywhere. Out of the 8 artists that have done work on me, Robbie P is one of my favorites.The shop is immaculate with all the stations organized and clean.I felt comfortable from the moment I walked in. Robbie is professional, courteous and prepared. He drew up a custom sketch and made sure it was perfect before he started. He discussed all the linework and colors to make sure I would be happy with the design.He prepared his station like a doctor getting ready for surgery. Sanitary workspace is definitely a focus at Broken Dagger.The tattoo process was very good. Robbie has a good hand when tattooing. Overall I am so happy with my tattoo. The attention to detail was top notch.I am looking forward to getting more Robbie.
5	This story begins well before we entered the shop. with plans for four of us to get tattoos during a birthday trip to Vegas.  My Aunt had a place in mind, but I knew better than to trust big name, big overhead, and big hype because that usually means big money and average satisfaction.  I did a little Yelping and found the reviews and the sample images for Broken Dagger to be a better fit for what we were looking for, since two of us had been inked before and two were newbies.  100% happy we chose Broken Dagger!!  We sent them ideas ahead of the trip and a day and time was booked for all of us with Robbie, Jake and Lily.  I can't say enough about Robbie.  He sent me several revisions of a memory tattoo idea for my Mom in the week leading up to the appointment.  He was open to my suggestions and kept one-upping me on the revisions until he reached an image that nailed everything I was hoping for.  It's really amazing when you tell and show someone what you have in mind and then they create something that is different but actually turns out to be exactly what you were going for in the first place and you just couldn't see it because you don't have the creative skills that they do to envision it.  That's why the best thing people can do is to let the artist be an artist and not a Xerox machine!  Thanks Robbie....you rule!  Broken Dagger looks and performs the way a tattoo parlor should!  No merchandise racks get in the way of  what's important here, which is a sharp focus on high quality artistry and total customer satisfaction.  The environment makes you want to get more ink or expand what you're there for just so you can hang out longer.  Everyone's attitude is easygoing, fun and welcoming - no ego's or big heads allowed.  The talent, patience, rapport, care and quality of each of the 6 artists there that day (Robbie, Jake, Gianni, Lilly, Derek, kill me for not remembering the other girls name) made for the best experience we could have imagined.  Speaking of talent - Jake busted out a highly detailed design on my Uncle in under two hours that one of the biggest hyped shops in Vegas said they couldn't do in the size, quality, price, or time that he did. They suck...Jake rocks!  Great to see artists believe in their own skills and welcome a challenge and don't steal your wallet in the process.  Honest work at an honest price.  The work that Lily did on adding to an existing tattoo on my Aunt's back is beautiful and looks more like a jeweled piece than a tattoo.    Again, great work!   I know that cleanliness and sterile conditions are one of the things that most people are most concerned with when it comes to getting tattoos.  Let me just say that after spending an entire afternoon at Broken Dagger, I would gladly eat sushi off their equipment, workstations, chairs and anything else in there...well...almost anything.  I've seen ER and surgical staff that aren't as thorough at sanitizing their gear and work areas as the folks at Broken Dagger are.  If you are worried about cleanliness, then Broken Dagger is going to be the standard by which you measure everyone else.If you've read all the way through this review, then you have no reason to go anywhere else in or around Las Vegas to get your tattoo.   They are the real deal and my only disappointment is that I live in the middle of the country and can't just drive on over and get more ink when I want.
5	Great tattoo parlor. Got with Gianni to do a full sleeve. I was leaving town in two weeks and he was able to fit me in on his day off.  The results were amazing. I would highly recommend this place to anyone seeking a high quality tattoo I Vegas.  I will def return for future work.
4	Loved the shop itself. The artwork and the atmosphere was amazing! It was super clean and sterile as well, which is very impressive to me. I did a lot of research before settling on this location and from all the work I saw on their facebook, combined with so many positive reviews, I decided to check it out.The reason I didn't give it the final star was because my artist was not talkative during the procedure and did not explain the after care process as in depth as I wished he had. He did do a beautiful job on the tattoo itself so I am not disappointed in any way.I will definitely go back to this location to get any future tattoos I decide on, and at that time I hope I can give it the final star!
5	Robby is absolutely fantastic! He worked with me over text messages to re-do and expand a very old and faded tattoo. He did an awesome job and I couldn't be more pleased with the results. He's professional, talented and an all around nice guy.
3	I got here the first time and nobody even talked to me. They need a receptionist.I went back again the next day (since I had business near that area anyway), and the parlor was empty. So they welcomed a walk-in (me).I ended up getting a tattoo bigger than I expected (but it was probably my fault, i should have been more assertive--- newbie here). The tattoo turned out ok (not great, but ok). I think if I could add color to this in the future, I might actually like it. The price is fair. $250 for a whole shoulder tat. Took about 2.5 hrs.Will I come back here again? Yes. The price is fair, the parlor is clean. I would get my next tattoo here. I scored it 3 stars because I was ignored the 1st day and I did get the exact tattoo on my mind.
5	People that visit Vegas often end up getting tattoos and they often wind up getting one at a low quality, dingy parlor in some alleyway off the Strip. Go out of your way to come here. It's brightly lit, clean, unique decor, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. 99% of the time they will take walk-ins.The guy that did my tattoo no longer works there, but everyone there is talented and will hook you up with some amazing artwork.
5	First off - LOVE Lily!!She is super sweet, very helpful and an awesome tattoo artist!I like the staff here. Mainly because they all seem to get along and joke around a lot. That always makes me feel comfortable. You're uncomfortable enough as it is when you're having your body needled up. This place is clean and the decor is pretty sweet. I called to make an appointment with Lily after seeing her portfolio on Instagram. I emailed her what I wanted and she was ready when I got there. I've had a hard time with people wanting to do my tattoo in all red. Some artists just don't like it because it doesn't always turn out as well - this is what I've been told. Lily said "no problem" and completed the job better than I even anticipated. They have very reasonable pricing and they're fairly easy to get into. I would recommend really knowing what you want before you go in and schedule an appt. They seem to get a lot of walk ins due to being so close to the strip. I'm glad I finally found a good tattoo parlor in town. It's hard to find good artists that are friendly. I got an all red lotus - representing my recent spiritual journey. I am more than pleased with the final product!
5	Absolutely love this shop! My sisters and I searched for a reputable shop and decided on Broken Dagger because of the reviews. I'm so glad we found this place. The guys are awesome and the quality is great. We'll definitely be returning next time we're in Vegas.
5	I was a walk-in and Robbie did my tattoo - was in Las Vegas for my bachelorette party.  I had a picture of what I wanted and I relied on his expertise to make it better.  The font he chose for the tattoo was awesome.  He also made a suggestion that definitely improved the tattoo.  His work is amazing and I am EXTREMELY happy with what he did.  He made sure he took the time to completely sanitize his station and equipment which is a HUGE deal to anyone who has gotten a tattoo before or looking to get one.  He also took his time to ensure my tattoo was perfect and made me feel extremely comfortable with him and the entire experience.  I could not be happier with it.  I HIGHLY recommend Robbie!!!!  If you're in Vegas and looking for a solid tattoo, go to Robbie.
5	After a ton of research my friend and I were both tattooed at Broken Dagger when we went to Las Vegas.  Lily was my tattoo artist and I have to say she is truly an amazing artist!  I had booked the appointment about 8 weeks in advance and really was having a hard time deciding what to get.  I sent her over multiple images of what I liked and she put together the most beautiful drawing!  My tattoo is so clear and definitely a one of a kind piece of art.  You will not be disappointed with Broken Dagger, the shop is clean and well lit and reasonably priced for the work I had done.      I can't say enough about Lily, again I think she has found her calling, her work is perfection!!  I would definitely go back again.  Thanks Broken Dagger!
5	I chose this parlor based upon other Yelp reviews and I can only concur with all the good things that have been said.    Its a beautiful shop with an inviting interior.   Kelsey was my artist and she did a brilliant job helping me draw the concept I was looking for.    She inked it up quickly and it looks great...and the time flew by as we chatted about random stuff.   Nice little lady and it would appear her colleagues are nice too.
5	Wow what a great environment and what great service by everyone in the shop. You really can't go wrong with any of the artists you choose to work with there but Jake is my tattoo artist and he has done a brilliant and amazing job on the two pieces he has done on me. :)))))The place is super sterile and open and airy (there are privacy curtains upon request). I love being able to look at all the great artwork surrounding the room. It also gives a sense of community in a way because everyone is showing off their artwork and exchanging stories. I always leave happy and beyond satisfied :))
5	Broken Dagger is an excellent place to go off the strip for tattoos. Everyone of the artists are warm, friendly and very professional. We had Robbie do a crown tatoo for my wife as she is my princess!! He did am awesome job drawing and then working with my wife to discuss what she was thinking and how it would look best.  We were very impressed with his work and the prices charged there are very reasonable and fair!! I would definitely recommend this tatoo place and we will be back. Oh, by the way we came back to Robbie for some more color on the crown in other spots and he touched it up and added the Color at no charge!!! Thanks Robby for the awesome tatoo!!
5	Got work done by lily and all I can say is amazing!! She is a great artist and super friendly. Can't see myself letting anyone one else tattoo me. She is simply BAD ASS!!
5	I just left Broken Dagger! I went in as a walk-in and I was lucky enough to have Lily work on me. I saw great reviews for her so I was really hoping she would be there. She had another appt coming in a  few hours but she squeezed me in! I got a dragonfly with Roman numerals underneath and I couldn't be happier with the results!! Lily is a true artist!!! And to top it off,she's so friendly and welcoming.  I've always seen pictures of beautiful tattoos and thought I would never have one as amazing as those but now I have it! As for the shop, there was great artwork hanging all over the walls. It was all very inspiring. The shop was also very clean. It was a great experience and even though I live in Southern California, I'll be coming back!
5	This was our first tattoo and the experience was amazing!The shop itself is so clean and bright. The walls are completely hidden behind all the artwork and character. The artists are friendly and even stayed open for us because we arrived late.Robbie, who did our tattoos, was warm and knowledgeable. The preparation that goes into each tattoo is so thorough. Everything was wiped down and sanitized for each of us. Robbie also helped us size our tattoos and was very patient as we decided the minor details.I would highly recommend this place to anyone in Vegas!
5	When you're in Vegas finding a tattoo shop isn't hard, finding a good one how ever isn't all that easy. Calling BrokenDagger a "good" tattoo shop is an understatement! BrokenDagger is an amazing tattoo shop with remarkable artist. I've had three visits to this shop and have loved every trip. Lily Flores, an incredible artist, has exceeded my exceptions on my pieces every time I come in! I Can't thank her enough for the beautiful ink she's bestowed upon me! Kelsey, Derek, and Robbie are a few of the other artist at the shop and all though I haven't revived any pieces from them, but while I was in my sessions I was able to see they're work as well as speak with them about the pieces they were working on. The artist really make me feel like I'm at home! I look forward to every time I get to go back ! Stay golden guys!
5	My wife and I decided to get tatoo while in vegas. We asked a few locals and several different shops were recommended, but none stood out.  Broken dagger was one of the recommendations, and  their online reviews were outstanding.  We just gave then a call around noon, the were very friendly,  and seamed really interested in what we wanted.  Had us text them pics of what we wanted, and told us they could get us in right away.  Got there and Robbie had everything ready to go.  My wife's was a simple tattoo, just words on here wrist.  But mine was more intricate and was a bit worried that the details would not shine through.  Well Robbie nailed it, the detail and quality of this tattoo is off the charts.  This shop is really nice, well ran, would highly recommend!   Only about a $15 taxi ride from central strip.  The best part was the price, half or less of what the big name casino parlors would charge.  So stand in line at the casino shop then wait 4 hours for your turn then pay double for lesser quallity, or hop your happy ass in a taxi and go to BROKEN  DAGGER.
5	I went to Broken Dagger this past Sunday 10/12 as my friend and I had appts and had placed deposits.  Even though there was a mess up with my appt; my reserved artist had switched shops but both he and the Broken Dagger owner worked to see that I would have an artist.  While my friend was getting two tattoos from Lily, Derek made himself available to me.Derek is a friendly and committed artist and he took my original tattoo idea and then amped it up with crisp script and awesome colors.  I am very pleased with the tattoo and am thankful to Derek for his artistic talent and good after care instructions and recommendations!My friend is very pleased with her tattoos from Lily.  The shop is very clean and all of the artists I observed practiced great hygiene skills and everyone was friendly and service oriented.   I would definitely go back to Broken Dagger for my next tattoo.
5	Lily was awesome!  She was super patient with me (I'm a first-timer) and did great work on my friend as well.  Great atmosphere and really nice staff.
5	Came here with a friend while on vacation after reading good reviews. We both went with Lillie. She made us really comfortable and really understood what we wanted and made great suggestions (which I thankfully took bc she was right!). I LOVE my new tattoo and couldn't be happier. I'd definitely come back.
5	**BACKSTORY FIRST!**: My Papa was murdered on Christmas Day when I was little and although we didn't grow up without a father figure, we still love and cherish our Papa. So for about 3 years, my eldest brother and I have been talking about the four of us siblings to get a tattoo together to commemorate our Papa and to show our unity. I am the youngest of the four and the two middle brothers did not agree to getting a tattoo, so it was down to just my eldest brother Nahko, and myself but throughout the years we never had a chance to meet up and get it done or even figure out what exactly we wanted. Over the weekend the Life is Beautiful music festival was going on Downtown and my brother and his amazing band (Nahko and Medicine For The People) were performing on Sunday. Prior to this weekend, I hadn't seen him in months. After his performance I went to the back to hug him and I was suddenly reminded that we were supposed to get a tattoo together so I told him and he was glad I remembered and just as I reminded him about the tattoo, (we still hadn't know what we wanted to get) he said that the beginning lyrics to his song "So Thankful" popped into his head. The words were 'Papa didn't die in vain' and as soon as he said it, we all got chills, we just felt it, it was perfect. It was decided. This was the tattoo we were getting. I found the script I wanted and searched around for other tattoo parlors on Yelp. The next day, (two days ago) we drove together to Black Dagger Tattoo Parlor and now... Here is my review:**REVIEW TIME!** I called earlier to see if we needed appointments and they said we could just walk in. I chose this tattoo parlor because it was one out of two that had complete 5stars but this one in particular had 46 reviews and the other had 22. My brother, a friend, and myself walked in and weren't really greeted upon arrival, so it was a bit awkward for me. My brother spoke up and said we wanted matching tattoos of a certain script, and a guy named Robby he asked me to text or email it to him and so I did. He came back with a print out of what we wanted and asked us to place it where we desired. Once we showed him, he turned and left saying he needed to set his station up. After maybe 10 minutes, I went back with him and my brother and our friend followed with me. I watched him, with gloves on, clean and sterilize my arm and take his time in ensuring that my tattoo would be straight along my arm,, not crooked, not too high or too low. I laid on the table/bed thing and he started. I tried to make small talk but felt a bit uncomfortable because he didn't seem friendly, mostly just "business". He told me it's because he was tired. He talked more once he asked what the meaning behind my tattoo was and the conversation went from there. My tattoo took about 20 minutes, easy.. Although I must say it was the most emotional experience I've ever had in my life. I felt like Papa was with us, proud of us, watching. It's the most important tattoo I have and it was inked with so much meaning and love behind it, I started to cry. I hope Papa loved it just as much. Prior to finishing up my tattoo, he gave me verbal instructions on taking care of and cleanings tattoo.Soon after was my brother's turn and it was an emotional experience for him as well. The only thing that was wrong with his tattoo was that one of the letter "i"'s were not dotted. We didn't notice until after we left though. Before we left he also gave us each a little postcard of instructions as well. Anyway, I would probably come back again on my next tattoo. I love this one and am very pleased with it. We'll see how it turns out after healing! I'll add some pics!!
5	I was commemorating my divorce weekend in Vegas. I had wanted a wrist tattoo for the last 5 years. Found this tattoo parlor and would 100% come back again. Clean. Friendly. Cameron was my man!!! If you are in Vegas, this is the place to be.
5	In Vegas for a week and worked with Derek over the phone. Did an excellent job! Would definitely get another tattoo here!
5	We came here on a referral from a friend. Kelsey did a great job on the 3 sister tattoos they all match great.I liked the decor and atmosphere here.The shop practiced great hygiene it was clean and professional. they got the drawing done quickly and Kelsey did all 3 tats in a couple of hours. They gave us great printed information on tattoo care.The whole staff was friendly, they obviously like what they do and were they work. We were all in the back watching each tattoo being done the staff was totally cool with that unlike other shops i have been in.I will definitely will be back here for more tattoo's.
5	Beautiful shop with friendly artists. A girlfriend and I got black cats for Friday the 13th.
5	I have been to Derek and all i can say he is an unbelievable artist.  Broken Dagger is the only place to get a tattoo if your in Vegas.
5	not only is this a great shop but the owner is so handsome and so buff .... his arms don't even fit in sleeves ! muscles muscles muscles xoxoxxo
