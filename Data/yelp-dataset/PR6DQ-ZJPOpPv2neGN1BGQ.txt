5	Anna has been helping us with Bucky since spring of 2010.  She isvery reliable and great with Bucky.  She comes every weekday to givehim a mid-day walk and has dog sat for Bucky several times while myhusband and I went out of town.  Anna is reliable, and always able tohelp out in a pinch.  She also goes the extra mile with Bucky - I cantell that he loves spending time with her and that she takes the timeto bond with him.  When Bucky was sick, Anna took care of him and evencleaned up after him.  She went above and beyond what we asked her todo, and I know Bucky appreciates it.  She is a great dog walker allaround, and also takes wonderful pictures of Bucky.  We are sothankful to have found Anna!
5	Anna is an enormous help to me and a friend and comfort to Molly. Even my last-minute 'Oh no I forgot to call Anna' pleas are taken care of. And Molly is visibly happier when I tell her that Anna is coming that day, and much happier when I get home. Anna truly cares about her charges, and I know I can depend on her.
5	Anna has been our dog walker for 5 months and is awesome!She is very reliable, trustworthy, and convenient. Our dog loves her! I would recommend her to everyone.
