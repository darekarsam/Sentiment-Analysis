1	With Reference TO:Dr. James Gabroy1535 W Warm Springs RdHenderson, NV 89014 (702) 450-3385 ,After feeling progressively worse, my family forced me to go for a second opinion.I advised my doctor, Dr. James Gabroy,  who I've seen each and every month for the last 15+ years, that I was going to do this and have any/all findings forwarded to him.After not receiving my usual courtesy appointment  reminder call, I called to confirm.  I was put on hold for quite some time and then politely advised that "The Doctor no longer wishes to care for me and has released not only me from his care, but my entire family"!   We are absolutely devastated.  The doctors REJECT list includes my 85-year-old father, my spouse and my two children ages 24 and 25.My advise to you,  going to Dr. Gabroy is a fantastic idea if your NOT sick!!  Just be prepared to sit in the waiting area for 3+ hours for your appointments and pray that you don't get sick enough that you might need a second opinion, because if you do go for a second opinion, you and your family will be thrown out on your asses!!!

5	Good doctor & staff is nice/ office staff... I've been coming to him for about 12 years. He's changed locations 3 times over this span of time. All locations have been relatively close to one another. I recommend Dr. Gabroy to my family and friends all the time.
