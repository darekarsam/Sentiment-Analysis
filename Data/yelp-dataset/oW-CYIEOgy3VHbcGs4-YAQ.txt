4	Great staff....friendly service....and they have some pretty good mortgage rates going right now for those of you who want to buy a home. I set up an account with them many months ago....but I had to review them because no matter when I go in there is always someone to help you....and the bank tellers are great. My favorite aspect of the credit union though is the coin machine.....that's right the coin machine. I save all of my change so when it starts to build up I can take it to desert schools put it into the coin machine and within seconds it counts it and prints me a receipt.Now I know many of you have seen these in grocery stores and the like but desert schools only takes 7.9% of your total while the stores take 10%. Now that may not seem like much...but when you have as many coins as I take every few months of so.....it adds up. So if you need a great place to securely handle your money and treat you like a real customer....then please give desert schools credit union a try. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
1	They're not exactly a model of kind or friendly customer service.They rejected me for a checking account. That isn't a problem, it's how they treated me after I was told; like "It's time for you to go".A modicum of decency would have been nice, not getting shuffled out the door.
4	I come to this location for shared branching. The service here has always been great and the staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. I'm also happy they are open on Saturdays!
