5	We had an emergency and he was here within minutes after we called for help. Such a great company and truly cares. We'd highly recommend and would use them again in a heartbeat. Thank you for saving my day!!!
5	I needed  a plumber to fix a leak and disposal  I used Maricopa Mountain plumbing. John came out took care of both problems. The price is 95.00 for an hours labor. They don't try to sell you stuff you don't need. Customer service is great. John was great, You can trust them!!!
5	Best deal for plumbers hands down in Maricopa. Other companies will charge you a huge service call fee and add another huge amount of hidden charges on top. Maricopa Mountain's staff is friendly and professional and gets to your needs quickly.
