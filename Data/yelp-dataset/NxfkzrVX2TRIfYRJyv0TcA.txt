4	They played a Kenny Loggins song while I was here. I liked that. Took me back to the day when I saw ol Kenny back in '87 in Memphis. He put on one hell of a show. Afterwards I got to meet him and I must say, he was a true guy. Really passionate about his music.
5	Great service, friendly staff, great doctor who explains in great detail which you can actually understand! Kids feel comfortable which is key!! Great job  Star
