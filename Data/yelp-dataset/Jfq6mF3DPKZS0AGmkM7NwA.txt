4	Closed. Next nearest location is at the Best Western on Rue Drummond. I feel they lost something during the move. I don't enjoy the food as much in their new location.
5	Yes, this place is bang for buck breakfast. Tastes great and a plethora of different variations on your good ol' breakfast mainstays. The presentation is really taken to heart at this place... Read as: they use many fallic fruit/food items... Gengis, our waiter was an aiight guy.. My Gurl called him Jean-Guy... Hahahaha
5	Oh, how I love this place. Honestly, the best breakfast joint I have ever been to. I love that you can get an artery clogging platter, or a big plate of fruit. There's something for everyone here, and the prices are fair. We had great service and now I understand why people line up for hours in Toronto to eat at the Cora's here.
