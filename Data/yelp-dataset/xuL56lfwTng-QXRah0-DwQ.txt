1	Very unimpressed with this salon. I got a basic trim and it cost $75. I felt like this was a bit over priced for what I got, but nonetheless I went back a second time and the price was increased to $100. So beware prices apparently they just go up whenever they feel like it. Additionally, making an appointment was a pain as no call was ever returned after leaving a message at the salon. Overall, just not worth the price and hassle.
5	I have been going to my hair dresser Tanya for about two years,  and a few months back she relocated to this cute salon. It is super convenient, located right off of the 101 and 90th st. The building itself is very simple on the outside, and is tastefully decorated on the inside. The staff is friendly and quick to offer you a beverage while you wait. Tanya is an amazing hairdresser, she takes the time to listen to any details/concerns regarding cutting and styling your hair. I get highlights done and they always come out just as blonde as I would like. Tanya also provides a great cut, when I first came to her she had a way of showing me how damaged my hair really was, (it was really bad, different lengths with breakage) and she helped me recover my hair even when I was scared of a little trim. Definitely recommend this studio, getting ready for the next holiday or event? - stop by, you'll love it.
5	Love my cut, love my color, loved my whole experience! I'm SO picky with my color and Tanya did an amazing job nailing exactly what I wanted! Not to mention she asked all the right questions before hand, making sure we both had the same idea on the length and tones of color I wanted, so professional and so reassuring as a new costumer trusting someone with their hair! 4 stars! And thank you again!
