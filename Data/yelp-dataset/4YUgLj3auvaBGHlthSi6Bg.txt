4	The crispy duck was excellent. Nearly half a duck for the price too!Good size servings for the price, quick. They made an excellent attempt to provide service in French.  Will definitely return here again.
3	I was not sure if I should give it a 4 star or a 3 star. If I was rating it for Laval it would be a 5 star as there is nothing else decent when it comes to chinese food. But in the real world of chinese food its really a 2 star. So I gave it a 3 star as it's just OK. If you do not want to go into the city I would recommend this place as the food is ok. Your typical General Tao(No such dish in china), fried noodles etc... very canadianized food. For those who really want good chinese food go to Toronto or china. Montreal......forget it!! Like everything else Montreal gets screwed.
5	Quiet evening at this nicely appointed restaurant. The salt and pepper chicken, orange chicken, and pork fried rice were all fabulous. The entire family was pleased with the food and the service.
