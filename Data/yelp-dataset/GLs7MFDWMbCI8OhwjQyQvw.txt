4	A dismal shopping experience in another AA store left me bewildered but determined to find myself a proper leotard supplier! I'm pretty sure I've found it in AA Mont-Royal! I went, I saw, I tried everything for a bloody long time and...I was graciously looked after! I suspect the size of the shop has something to do with it: it is so cramped neither you nor the employee can avoid one another for any reason.I had come to buy nail polishes (their selection and quality is excellent!) and they let me paint my nails one, after, the, other, for a good half hour! After a point, I sheepishly told a lovely salesperson I was trying them out, to which she replied "That's what they're for, take your time!". Another passed by me to make sure everything was alright and we chit-chatted about good winter colours for a while.. When I had finally made my choice, the cashier couldn't help me out immediately, she was on the phone, helping someone shopping online! So I guess that means you can call them beforehand to make sure your favorite tight and fishnet styles are in store!
