3	Pleasant service and a good selection of cacti are available here.  I greatly appreciated all of the extra information on care for my new cacti, and helping me to avoid a few varieties that would require more effort than I was willing to provide.  Both premium examples as well as a few discount ones were available, depending on one's needs.  Free delivery and planting with $500 purchase.  I'm going to truly enjoy my new Saguaro and barrel cacti.
4	My husband and I visited this nursery on a Saturday and couldn't believe how large the place was!  We spent an hour walking around and examining all the variety of cacti wondering how we would ever make a decision!  We picked out a few that we thought we would like and the gentlemen that helped us steered us toward varieties that would best work for our yard.  We ended up purchasing 4 beautiful cacti which were installed this past Wednesday quickly, efficiently and as scheduled.  We're already talking about going back for more!
