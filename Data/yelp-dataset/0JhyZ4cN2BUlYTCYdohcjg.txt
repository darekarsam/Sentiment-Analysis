5	Had 5 cars done at AZM. The best window tint shop. They also have audio system too. Actually sitting in the shop waiting for my new window tint. Post from iPhone.****************************************************WAIT! Here is the update 2009-06-30 1:55PM****************************************************Had 5 cars window tinted at the shop in the past years. I think I have gave the 5 stars review too fast. The owner seem to changed few time in the past year. I will write more review about this shop when I get my car fixed.The first 4 cars tinted in the past years are perfect. Somehow the 5th one got screwed up. The job was done OK with a visible gap/edge between the film and the window frame. They took the car back for re-tint some of the pieces. It turns out using the wrong film and scratch/chip the window frame on my new car. They guy tinted the window seem to be nice, but getting inpatient when we ask why the frame was chipped and the film was wrong. Not trying to finger point, but wanted to get it fixed. Waiting for the owner to call back and see what they can do to fix it. Will update the review.****************************************************WAIT! Here is the update 2009-07-01 4:55PM****************************************************Finally, the re-tinted windows are fixed without no cost. The chipped window frame will be replaces with one of the body shop without cost me anything. It is very hassle, but they are willing to work out the issues and fix the problem. Still give them 5 stars, since I was very satisfied with them for the first 4 cars.
4	What a great shop! They did repairs on my 95 Honda Accord and tinted a widow! Great customer service and will be back! I was referred by a coworker to AZM and let me tell you what a great feeling it is to find a great local shop!   Yep Im a fan!
5	Been a customer of AZM since the beginning.  They have worked on 10 different cars of mine over the years and I have nothing but rave reviews for them.  They are a family owned business and it shows.  Dale Jr runs an amazing shop!  They take their time with the repairs and explain in detail what work they will do.  They have taken care of all of my alarm needs, installed all my tint on my vehicles and they handle all of my maintenance needs.  I'm a customer for life.
4	The guy that assisted me was Dino. The window tinted happened on Saturday. So far the job looks good. Dino informed me that the bubbles that are currently in the window will disappear; they are!!! I see the film getting smoother. I will place another review soon!
5	Fantastic service, honest and friendly mechanics, good prices - this is a wonderful locally family run business.  I have taken both of my vehicles here (one domestic, one foreign) and have always received courteous and helpful service.  Dale and Dale Jr. are friendly and knowledgable and actually try to save you money, which is the complete opposite of any other shop I have been to.  I will never go anywhere else!!!  This place is the BEST!!!
5	I love these guys. They take care of me every time I am in their shop. I will come back for window tinting in the future.
1	Horrible service, they don't explain they type of tint they use will be different and have a shine look from the inside, which while driving is beyond annoying and then they want me to pay to have the correct tint put on and I have bubbles in my window still from the tint job. Hands down the worst place to get tint done waste of time and money!
