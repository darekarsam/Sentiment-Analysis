1	The only thing positive about this gas station is that it's newer. Today I chose to get gas here. It's Sunday morning at 9am... And music is blaring so loud from the speakers on the building towards the pumps that I can't even hear myself think... In addition to that you have the new pump also trying to sell you all these different products through their advertisements... It's sad when you can't even have peace and quiet getting gas without trying to be sold something from the pump and music blaring in your ears!
1	Loud!  Music is loud...pumps are loud...too much going on.  Can I just get a tank of gas?!
