2	Mostly old fashioned clothing but nice decor & above average service
3	Anthropologie is one of my favorite retailers, and this location is OK. It's a smaller sized store, but I've still always had pretty good luck with finding product that I like here. I've also had good luck with their sale product. I agree with a previous reviewer -- they may have more sale product than some stores because their location probably doesn't receive the traffic that other stores do. This location receives three stars instead of four because of their customer service. Stores like Anthro should have amazing customer service, but I've never been blown away by any of the associates here. I'm rarely greeted at the door, had an associate one time who was a little grouchy about completing an online return, and have had to wait some time to have a fitting room opened for me. This is the kind of service that I would expect at a store with price-points half that of Anthropologie.
3	Wow really?  I'm the first to post a photo for this store?  This store has been here for what... almost a decade maybe more?  This was the first and only Anthropologie in all of Pittsburgh at one time.  Mt. Lebo yes this was the only one.  Now there's one at Bakery Square in Point Breeze.I went to Anthropologie today because we happened to be nearby in Mt. Lebanon and it's my wife's favorite store.  As usual it is a search and park my behind on the couch but today with the newer holiday displays there was NO couch.  What?  How do you get rid of the only men's section of the store so easily?  Wrong.While it's a nicely designed store and in he Galleria I have to think it's one of the few major stores in the entire mall.  Anthropologie stores are usually in the most affluent shopping areas and/or malls in the country.  The Galleria is sort of a mystery to me but Anthropologie is IMO one of the mall's anchors considering it's not a department store.
