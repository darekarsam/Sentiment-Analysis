4	At first the place really didn't catch my eye, especially with its name which can sound a bit cheesy. Oh how wrong I was!The concept is simple: they cook giant pizzas and sell them slice by slice. The pizzas on offer change regularly and the service is very casual (no cutlery etc).Right now the pizza is really nice there, the dough is a mix of crusty and fluffy, which I like better than very thin bases. Try the Salame Piccante or the Boscaiola!Now the only problem here, is that for less than a fiver for two slices and a drink, it's almost cheaper than my uni's canteen. I'm not sure eating pizza every day is very good for my line, so I'm obviously not going daily, but for the price and taste, it's really hard no to!
