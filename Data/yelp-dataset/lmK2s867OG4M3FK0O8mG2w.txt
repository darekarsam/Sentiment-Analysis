5	This camp is fabulous. Run by Karyn Miller, the principal of Fountain Hills Charter School, this camp is as good as day camps get. Karyn's exuberance and love for working with children comes through in every aspect of this camp. She hand picks counselors who share her enthusiasm, making for a positive environment filled with fun activities (arts and crafts, archery, sports, water play, and a host of other creative activities), friendship, and happy children. My son comes home from his day tired and happy. He's graduated to Camper Leader this year and is loving it! What a gem to have here in Fountain Hills. (She sends vans to pick up in Scottsdale too!)
1	Bad service. Spoke with the person that runs the place and got hung up on. Will never deal with them again.
5	We had such a great experience with Cactus Day Camp. As a total helicopter mom, I'm a little bit nervous leaving my kids with anyone for the first time. But this camp was held at our kids' regular school campus, with a lot of admin working there, so we felt good about giving a couple sessions a shot between summer trips. Our son had the BEST time - it was more like going away to a real camp in that Karyn (the owner) brought in a huge water slide, archery, swimming, arts and crafts, and held lots of special activities including a cookout on Fridays. My husband and I were impressed at the counselors assigned to small groups of kids, and that our son's counselor called before the first day of camp to introduce himself. Everyday our son would come home exhausted and happy from a fun day and telling us how much he likes Ms Karyn. We also enjoyed the photos that were sent at the end of each session showing the kids and counselors having fun. Overall it was a fantastic experience and I think it made my son excited for the school year and seeing his friends again. We're hoping the camp will be at our school again next year.
