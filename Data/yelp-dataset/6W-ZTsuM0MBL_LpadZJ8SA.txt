5	Excellent service. My stylist was efficient and gentle. She did exactly what I asked. The head rub was good. Also for you single guys she was attractive.
5	If you haven't given this place a try you're missing out. Haircut's great, beard trim..yes please and when they put that final touch with the close shave it makes for a home run. Keep up the great work and will see you soon!
5	Great price for the quality! No wait great cuts and great prices best place in town. I'm a regular and after a long week the free head rub is always nice!
5	I have been hooked on this place since my first haircut there. A quality cut with a scalp massage and I never had to wait. The place is very clean and professional. The women barbers are very beautiful especially Reyna who cuts my hair. I highly recommend a visit.
