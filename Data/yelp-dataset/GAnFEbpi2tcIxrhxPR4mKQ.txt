4	Tough to find places around here to eat, so my regular lunch stops consist of Pollo Rico, La Shish Kabob, and Ben Thanhs.. Pollo Rico has well excecuted rotisserie chicken with excellent spices.  Also try the fried Yuca, it has a sweeter taste than fries but quite a bit healhier for you.
5	Their "Torta Mexicana" is soooo delicious. Love this place! Friendly people, nice and quiet, quality food.
3	I stopped by to pick up some dinner and it was almost closing time, but the cashier is still pretty nice. I got half rotisserie chicken, grill shrimp, fries, plantain, and 2 hachatas for $27, which is not bad.The main meal is very dried, it tasted like the just reheated the chicken in the microwave (I did heard a microwave click while I was waiting for my order). The hachatas tasted funny, it almost has this wood burn after taste to it. The fries are pretty good, and they give you this homemade sause to dip it in (it taste sorta like mayo and shrimp sauce together). The plantain is the best part of the meal, very sweet just like I remembered it.It's very close to my bf's place, so I would probably go back to try the tortas.
5	Hidden in an old Chinese restaraunt, this spot has GREAT Peruvian style roasted chicken. The plantains are also spot on. Cheap and quick, it's not much for atmosphere but a great place to stop on the way home and grab some chicken and a salad (try adding avocado to your salads). At least a handful of my friends love going here whenever their in town. Definitely worth it.
