3	Stopped by this Subway on the drive back home to Vegas from Phoenix.  It is conveniently located on the right side of the road heading to Vegas.I ordered a 6" BMT w/Jalapeno Cheddar Bread & had it toasted.  I added Tomatoes, Lettuce, Green Peppers, Pepperoncinis, Mustard, Mayo, Oil, Vinegar, Salt, Pepper.  They made it quickly and I was eating in no time.The ingredients were very fresh and the Sandwich tasted great.  A nice snack for the ride home.A bonus is the clean restrooms....a quick tip is to stop here to use the restroom instead of a nasty gas station....every gas station in Wickenberg was busy with travelers using the restrooms.Will I return?  Next time I drive to/from Phoenix, I will.
1	This subway has terrible service. The food is just ok and the space is not well kept.
4	Food is good but way understaffed at lunchtime
5	My veggie foot long was so fresh. The girl who made my sub even changed her gloves before making it. Food and service is good. I will definitely stop by this place when I go to Vegas or on my way back to Phoenix.
