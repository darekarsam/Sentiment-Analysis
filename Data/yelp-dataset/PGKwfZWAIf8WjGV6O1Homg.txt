4	I'm tempted to rate this place 1 star and beg you not to go there, just so I can continue to have the pleasure of moseying up to this wide comfy terrace any time of day and getting a corner seat looking out on Jean Talon Market, chatting with the friendly unhurried staff, lingering over the delicious 19$ table d'hote unmolested by crowds. But that would be wrong and selfish.Highlights include the fig pizza (yes, yes, a thousand times yes!) and the shooter of whipped cream that comes with the lattes. Expect dishes to change - the shooter of ice-cold liquid cantaloupe we enjoyed dipping our prosciutto in was gone the next time, but sent out with the chef's compliments when we mentioned to our charming bilingual waiter that we'd enjoyed it. Keep your eyes out for Basi Express: set to open in 2011 offering sandwiches, pizzas, and salads.
2	The two stars are for the food, as Service was worst.  There was one nice waitress with curly dark hair but sadly she was not ours.  Our guy kept bumping into my chair every time he went by.  And the maitre d':  some people cannot find their way out of a shoe box.  She was one of those people.  If the service was any slower, they'd go backwards in time (I'd go to restaurant that could do that).Food was very average, but not bad.  Unrefined.Don't go!
3	While the food had our 12 person group wowing left and right, the service was TERRIBLE, this was on a Wednesday night at 9 pm mind you...
