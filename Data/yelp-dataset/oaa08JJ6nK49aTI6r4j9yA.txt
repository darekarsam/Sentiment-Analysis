4	The decor in this store is immaculate! This is not a cheesy goth store with rubber bats hanging from the ceiling, this is a store decorated with beautiful gothic lamps, and a couple of shiny coffins. They carry a wide array of styles from cyber-goth, to fetish-goth with all the big brands represented. You can also get stompy boots, jewellery and designer goggles for enhanced freakyness. The store is split into a giant section for girls, and a smaller second rooms for dudes, and each side has their own changerooms to reduce peeking!
3	I suppose if you're a goth in Montreal that this is the place to shop. It's very similar to the Metro in Seattle, but I like the layout of Cruella more.The staff was quiet but friendly upon our entering the moment the opened.Lots of brands like Lip Service, Living Dead Souls, some cryoflesh too.Since most of their wares are made in the US I didn't want to buy anything because i could get it back home. But it was great to look around.
2	I wasn't too thrilled with the place. They didn't have much of a selection and they didn't have larger sizes. I just sat next to the mannequin on the couch until my friends were done. Even their jewelry selection wasn't that appealing. The decor is great!
