5	Love the staff everyone there very nice really looking out for the welfare of my daughter.  Unfortunately we had to move out of state we've been gone a year and came back to visit.  I can already tell the facility is still just as good as it was when we left.  Everyone remembered us and they were excited and thrilled to see my daughter.  If we ever get to come back here I would go back there in a heartbeat.
5	We love this place.  We put our foster children in academically behind.  In less than 6 months both children are not only meeting the standard for their age group, they are exceeding it.  The staff is friendly.  Their behavior toward the children help them feel loved and safe.
4	Feeling the love and sincere care for my 4 year old son. Great staff, awesome curriculum  and he even likes the food. If your in need of quality child care Kids R Kids id the place. Ask for Bonnie and tell them Frank sent you...
5	My wife and I have had all of our children attend Kids R Kids on Cimarron since they were babies. Our youngest started when he was 6 weeks old and is still in now at 3 years old. The staff is amazing and they truly seem to care for the kids. If anyone is looking for a wonderful environment for their kids, we highly recommend Kids R Kids on Cimarron.
