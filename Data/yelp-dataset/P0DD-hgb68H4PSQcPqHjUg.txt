5	Last night I went to a performance of Othello. I'm not sure what my expectations were, but this local theatre company exceeded anything that I thought could be possible in a small space in the back of the commercial center. Run, don't walk to buy season tickets to this theatre!! They are so wonderful! I couldn't believe my eyes that there was so much effort put forward for a local group! Thank you to Insurgo for making the performing arts happen in Las Vegas!
4	I have been going to Insurgo productions for a couple of years, and I was excited to see them get their own theatre in Sahara Commercial Center.  Since its opening several months ago, improvements have been made, and the theatre has gotten better.Last night, I attended Rossum's Universal Robots by Karel Capek.  This is very well done by a terrific cast.  It will be playing until July 10th, so you only have a short time if you want to see the show, too!Check out their website.  There is something playing there almost every weekend.
5	Great plays, great productions, excellent acting.Vegas may be known for the over-the-top, spectacle extravaganza gigantic show, but Insurgo is consistently offering the best theater in Vegas.  The plays they choose are thought-provoking and entertaining and they are staged in an small, but interesting space in Commercial Center.They say that  hungry artists produce the best work.  Based on the brilliance of the Insurgo plays I've seen, the cast and director must be starving.
5	a wide range of both productions and talent, nothing below excellent, true a bit on the fringe at times but highly entertaining, casting is always firt class. Insurgo proves the Theater movement in Las Vegas is alive and well.
5	Gotta love the Insurgents!  No matter the play, they put their all into it.  This group deserves to have an audience because they lay their hearts on the boards. There is a lot of talent hanging out in New Orleans Square, no doubt about it.
