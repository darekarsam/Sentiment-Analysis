2	Went there twice since we stayed in the hotel it is attached to Wings were decent. Food was mediocre, kinda bland, soup was warm flavored water. Just go here for wings, beer, and to watch sports.
1	I like to go to a sports bar to watch an event... But I got to say that this place looks ooooold and outdated.  Food is meh... but am I setting my expectations to high for La Cage Aux Sports?  I don't know, but this one in particular, is not that great.  The Boisbriand one is much nicer and worth the detour if you can make it.
