5	I've been going to Ciera for 7 years and she's always done a great job and I recommend her to everyone looking for a new stylist.
5	Ciera has been cutting and coloring my red hair for over 2 years.  She is incredible and really takes the time to listen to what her clients want to achieve with their hair.  I get compliments on my hair color all the time.  I was happy to follow her to here new space even though it is further away, she is totally worth it!!
5	I have been going to Cassie for almost two years now and every time I go in she out does herself. The color is always perfect! She always knows exactly what I want. As long as I'm in Arizona I will always go to Cassie.
5	Ciera is AMAZING! It's hard to find someone who understands what you want...especially wanting to be blond. Ciera has been cutting, highlighting, and adding extensions to my hair for over a year now.
5	Love the location and the salon is super cute. Ciera cut and colored my hair. Left looking and feeling like a new woman! Will def go back.
5	best salon around! Cierra does amazing work with hair. I have naturally thick, curly hair and she does magic on it every time! I leave her salon I couldn't be happier with my hair! I highly recommend this salon, it's the perfect little spot to get pampered and get the perfect cut!
5	I have been going to Ciera for 6 years!  Wouldn't let anyone else touch my hair.  I get so many compliments on my hair.  She works magic! I highly recommend her!
5	Cierra is my stylist and she did a nice job.  My hair looks great and the service was excellent.  The salon is a good place and the girls are friendly.
