3	If you are looking for household items or seasonal gifts, you'll want to stop at Pier 1 Imports. There's always a ton of stuff, lots of colors, and multiple fragrances. Really, it's like a hit or miss mess...good and bad. Some of the products are of solid quality, while other things look cheap. Test your luck, be prepared to look at lots, and hopefully you'll find something fun. The sales associates are friendly and helpful.
3	I most certainly agree with Faith D on this one...this Pier 1 is filled to the gills with a myriad of home goods. It's especially great for entertaining platters, decor and holiday items. And, if you're lucky, you may be able to score a sweet hurricane or table runner in the large clearance section. In general, you'll have to do some serious digging. While the employees are very chipper and helpful with suggestions and such, this store is crammed with items. So much so that it may make one feel a bit claustrophobic. Regardless, there are goodies to be had and deals to be found. If you're seeking items for your home or a housewarming gift, check out Pier 1.
4	Place - smaller store than the ones I am used to. So sometimes I feel I am missing out some good items at other stores, that are not readily available here. Price - most of the times, I am able to find a good deal! My most prized possession and good buy was this green/gold/brown mosaic mirror! Staff - courteous and always welcoming!Leave it to Pier 1 to have lots of mosaic tile tables, frames, plates, and etc!When I shop here, I do have a reason (sometimes none at all).- look for my seasonal sprays of flowers for my hanging wall vase - for diff seasons :D Perfect place to get them, since they are sometimes cheaper, and a lot prettier than Michaels.- their vast selection of Christmas ornaments!!- some greenery for above the kitchen cabinets- beautiful glass infused with metallic paint plates!- .. And whatever I find deemed worthy!
