2	i ordered a part from Leslies, they got the part in quickly but just didn't seem to have any customer service skills, same two guys on both times there and they both seemed to feel they were doing me a favor talking to them. I don't know what else exists around henderson but I will be looking, they were horrible.
1	Agree with the previous reviewer that they have no PR skills. I purchased paint (rubber-based Sr Pro 7) from their Henderson branch at Valle Verde location and followed all the instructions provided by the store manager. The paint started chipping and coming off, however, within a month! When I went back to report and provide feedback, they did not even listen to simply stating  that "it was 100 percent user failure, not the paint." I wasn't, of course, expecting my money back, but it was so disappointing to see them not even engage with their customers. The worse is they removed my review from their website!!! They now show three reviewers who rated them five stars! What a bogus!!! I will spend my money elsewhere...
5	quiite happy with the service. they were great about answering my many questions. will be returning to get my pool supplies.
