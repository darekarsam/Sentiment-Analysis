5	Great customer service,
1	Price quoted on the phone was $20 cheaper than what I was charged by manager Dennis after I spent an hour removing the radiator. I was also told on the phone that they had my year and model of car on the lot. When I got there I was told they didnt, but the new model would fit. When I got home the radiator didn't fit, and they wont refund even though they dont have the correct part. So I had to buy a new radiator in the end. Waste of time and money. This company is a scam.
1	This place is awful. They will tell you they have stuff then charge you an admission to enter and find out they dont have what your looking for. The "manager" Lawrence provided me the poorest example of customer service i have ever had. The guy is not fit to work anywhere where human interaction is a part of the job. The prices were decent but I'd rather pay double than deal with them again. If you check out their google review you'll see im not the first with this exact complaint.
1	It would had been nice if pick n pull left a message letting us no there no more pick n pull in AZ. N closes one to us is in fresono, CA.
