1	My husband was 9 minutes late to an appointment with the nurse. They turned him away because he was late. The last time we were in the office we waited over 40 minutes for somebody to enter the exam room. And you're telling me we would have seen the nurse exactly at 10 am had he been on time? Seriously? Last visit at their office.
1	I was 12 minutes late for my appointment for my daughter. Pulled her out of school to go to the appointment and was running a few minutes late. I even called and told them I was running a few minutes late. How many times have I waited at this doctor having arrived on time and waited 20, 30, 40 minutes ? Every time ! Ridiculous.
1	Office staff here are rude and very uneducated. Has changed since Dr. Dezenbergs departure.
