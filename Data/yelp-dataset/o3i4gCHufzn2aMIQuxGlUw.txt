2	Why does one spend 5.95 on a piece of cardboard with glitter, a few words, and pretty pictures on them? This is one of the biggest scams out there. I think Hallmark invents holidays to sell more cards. Really?  Boss's Day cards? You can go to Dollar Tree and get 2 very similar cards with pretty pictures on them, some glitter and nice wording for a buck. After all, more than likely, the person receiving the card is going to look at it and toss it in the trash container. Big waste of money. This store has tons of collectables, candy, and the Hallmark Christmas ornaments so many of my relatives collect. I admit freely, I do buy myself the yearly Star Trek starship they offer each year, not here though, i buy it after Christmas on Amazon at a greatly reduced price.
3	I went to this particular store today just to buy ornaments.  This store is not too different from the other Hallmark stores in the area we've been to recently.The Christmas ornament collection here is actually pretty well stocked.  We were in some of the other stores in Moon and Robinson and we had trouble getting the 4 Songbirds (12 days of Christmas) ornament for this year.  This store had quite a few of them so if you seeking this one they had a bunch.Hallmark has a coupon on their national website that is save 5 dollars for your purchase of 10 dollars or more and we were able to use no problem.  We did have an issues at the store at 1717 Cochrane (Emily's Hallmark)  just minutes before as they refused to accept this coupon.  This store in Mt. Lebanon gave us no such hassle and they were quick and friendly as well.
