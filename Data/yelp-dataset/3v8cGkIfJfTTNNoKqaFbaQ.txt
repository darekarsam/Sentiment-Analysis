5	Always excellent service and prices.
5	This Super Target is INCREDIBLE!  The groceries here are really fresh and good, I was very surprised!  They also carry an abundant assortment of wines, which also pleasantly surprised me, and with a Starbucks right inside and every thing else from clothes to beauty products to furniture, this is literally your one stop shop for absolutely every errand you have to run.  HUGE FAN!
2	Carts are always filthy. Most kids working there are what I call "don't cares". They need lessons in customer service. Check your receipt as the wrong prices often ring up. The older checkers are so slow it is painful. The produce is bruised and pitiful. Their meat is the more expensive than most without justification.
4	I come here at least 3 or 4 times a week because it is so close to my house. I usually like to cruise through all the clearance. Everyone is alway helpful here and I can find just about anything I could need.
4	Clean store & the set up is always the same so its easy to navigate.
5	Typical Target.  I do like how they have the added benefit of a starbucks and (I believe) a Pizza Hut express. They also have a grocery side that has a pretty good selection (produce even)!
5	Clean,  great service, nice cashiers.
