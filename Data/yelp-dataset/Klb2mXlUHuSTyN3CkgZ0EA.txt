4	I was driving on the other side of town when I saw this little Mexican market, and I mean little, but I was surprised how much stuff they have in there, it's like a little of EVERYTHING in there !They  have a kitchen where you can order from breakfast, to lunch and even dinner, but you can't eat there, they sell beer, regular groceries and the best part, they have a meat department, good prices and vast quality!I've been going there for like 2 months now, very convenient,  I really like the people there, they are helpful and friendly.
1	I live close to El Gordito super market, I go there NOT so often, there are flys EVERYWHERE! The hot and ready food that is out to serve is always left open. The food gets dried, they still serve it that way! Dried food + flys = NASTY! I Bought a Torta and when I tried it, the meat was ROTTEN. Tasted Disgusting! Also, You can see Flys in the glass display, where the Bread is in! Gross!
