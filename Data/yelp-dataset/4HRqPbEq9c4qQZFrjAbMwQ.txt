5	I hope these guys do well down here in Phoenix as they are a great bunch of people. The reason I say this is we were looking for a certain firearm to use as a thank you gift for a group of friends and these guys came through. At the time it was a very hard firearm to find and these guys came through with flying colors. The only place we could find the amount in stock and for the best price around. We made the trip up north after a couple of conversations on the phone and made our purchase. If you are looking for some hard to find or just your run of the mill everyday firearms these guys are definitely the people to see. I wish you guys all the luck with your new store I know you will make it a success.Dave
