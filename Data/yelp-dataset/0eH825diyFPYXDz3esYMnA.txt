3	There is wine here. That alone merits the three stars. The wine is kind of expensive, however. I am not sure if it's just this store, SAQs in general, or because I am used to buying wine at Trader Joe's in Boston, but I spent around $12 for a pretty mediocre Reisling. A convenient location if you desperately need wine, but next time I am in MTL I will try looking around a bit more for cheaper prices.
3	Convenient wine and liquor store. The upstairs Signature boutique is pleasant and ritzy, and the downstairs SAQ Classique is like a clean mini-mart.Picked up a few bottles for dinner (not too expensive, credit cards accepted), then headed on our way. The cashier asked me if I wanted a bag (extra); next time I'll buy an SAQ wine tote!Neat trivia: This is the first SAQ I've ever walked into.
4	I just like this SAQ outlet because it is just so neat..As this is the first ever SAQ I ever visit, I am not sure what to expect. Then I saw this doorway... my friend asked me to go in through this sliding door.. and I am impressed with all these wine selections... some of them are way out of my price range but at least I know where to get them now if I do need a bottle or 2.The space is a little tight as I wear my winter jacket and try not to bum into anything...
3	The store showcases liquor and wines in a way that makes you want to buy. The downstairs wine cellar is beautiful, but could do without boxes of (not so) special buys piled everywhere.I love coming here to look at the fine wines and buy some of the day-to-day alcohol. Recently I did a price comparison on an 85$ bottle of wine. While I know that Canadian wine has more tax, I found the same bottle at 5 places in the US ranging from 42-55$ u.s. Quite a difference!
3	Very decent wine selection. Nice selection of ice wines (one of my main reasons for going to Canada!). The prices aren't bad - way cheaper than the hotel's wines.
