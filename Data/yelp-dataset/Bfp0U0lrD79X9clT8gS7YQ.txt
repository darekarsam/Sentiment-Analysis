5	Do you need granite counters? A new floor? Back splash? This place is worth a visit.Super friendly greeting in an immaculate showroom. I want to look at some granite. I'm given a hard hat and escorted into the back. Whenever I've looked at granite I am offered a few small samples. Not here.There is a warehouse full of huge slabs of granite & marble, carved straight out the mountain or quarry or wherever you grow granite, every color, every pattern ranging from fancy to really flipping fancy. I think you need look no further!
5	Very friendly and knowledgeable staff! Made us feel welcome and comfortable...told us about the store and diff tiles then let us wander alone to browse. Didn't feel any pressure to buy and no salesman like attitude. They're selection was huge...almost too much to choose from. They let us take samples around the store to compare as well as take home. Placed and order with them and definietly wil be back for our next project!
