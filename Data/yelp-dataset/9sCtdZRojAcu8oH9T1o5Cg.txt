2	The flowers at this market are awesome, but I am pretty sure they are selling grocery store seconds on the fruits and veggies.  I have gotten many veggies from here that had rotten cores or went bad the next day or so.  A good place to buy cheap veggies for dinner that night, but I am not sure that any of this food is local.
2	I was so excited to drive along King Street and find this Farmer's Market. From the street it is so inviting and colorful! This market seems to attract a lot of people.I was very disappointed once I started looking more closely at the products. The market sells produce that you would find at a grocery store (perhaps slightly lower prices due to difference in overhead). I talked to one of the workers there and he said that they do not carry organic or local products (with the exception of some local Carolina strawberries that day). However, he said to check back in a month because they may start carrying some local types of products. I want to support local growers and sustainable practices by shopping at Farmers Markets. I do not plan on returning here when I can buy the same produce at a local grocery store. However, if you enjoy shopping outdoors and it encourages you to eat more fruits and veggies, this would be a nice experience.
2	lame.  most of the stuff isn't even local, and the parking lot can be a zoo.  Last time I checked, they didn't grow bananas in Charlotte.
2	Parking is a nightmare and the vendor's produce looks half dead every time I've been. There isn't anything here you can't get in better shape at the grocery store.
5	it is wonderful! and for the other posters that were complaining about tropical fruits in charlotte clearly they are not grown here but I would rather buy them cheaper and fresher and support local growers! Last time I checked South Carolina is pretty darn close to North Carolina and that is where a lot of the fruit and vegetables come from. i have never had anything bad from the farmers market and it is a much quicker stop then going to any other local grocery store. Maybe previous posters have not been in a while! I love it and could not wait until they came back! It is always a regular trip for us.
4	Excellent farmer's market, best in Charlotte.  For convenience, they carry local and non-local items.  Just use your brains, the pineapple of course are is from around here.  Same goes for the lemons and limes, although they are a good price.  That said, you can get fresh, local in-season corn, peaches, apples, etc.  The peaches here are some of the best I have been able to find in the South.  I also recommend the watermelon and the guy with fresh shrimp and seafood.  They have a nice selection of plants, after a few months I gave up on killing their herbs and flowers $2.50 at a time and left that to the pros.  The new market at Atheron Mill is nice, but focuses more on prepared foods, presentation, etc with a more "yuppie" feel.
5	I really love this farmer's market, even if it's not all strictly local food.This is not only the closest market to me, but it is very reasonably priced.  As long as it is operating, I never go to Harris Teeter for produce.  I especially love it when they get in Muscadines and scuppernongs.  We didn't see much of those of north, and I'm addicted to them now.  In addition to the great produce, they've got the seafood guy there and the people from Proffitt Farms, who sell grass-fed beef (I think they're only there on Saturdays).  And right next door there's a great plant and flower vending operation, complete with fruit and vegetable seedlings in the spring.This and other farmers markets are part of what makes living in the South so great.
5	It might not be all local food, but it is very affordable.  They have heirloom tomatoes, actual real honest to god apples that look like real apples from the NC mountains, fresh corn, local grapes and inexpensive grocery items like celery, lemons, carrots, etc.  They also have a garden center with seasonal plants which is a great place to buy herbs.  You can also usually find some local baker or farmer with fresh breads, farm fresh eggs and organic meat.  Come Halloween, it turns into a sea of pumpkins.  It's a great place to find a funky pumpkin (they like fruit and veggies that look real, not plastic here!).  You really cannot beat the prices.  I wish it was open more days than Tuesday and Sunday.  There is also a seafood guy, but since i'm allergic I steer clear.  Remember to bring cash or a local check!  Parking also can be dicey, there is a lot across the small side street for market goers.
5	**sighing**  This is my favorite place to visit early Saturday mornings from May-October, and I'm getting very sad as the end of October approaches**sighing**  I love coming here for watermelon and muscadines, but also to stock up on fresh veggies for the winter.......the tender greens, green beans, corn, lima beans, peppers.....my freezer is loaded.  I will certainly miss this place come the end of October.........
3	I bought a ton of mums here (re: wedding flowers) a couple of weeks back. They're still going, and the lady who helped me pick was full of advice and (once I told her) super nice congratsy on your marriagey. Cut me a deal, since I was buying so many. Here's how to get that side more bloomed before your big day. Awesome.But yeah - the produce is pretty lame, and the local delicacies almost non-existent. Which is kinda that whole idea behind Markets, no? It's the end of October (or was). Where's the cider? It's the middle of summer (again, was). Seriously? No local zucchini?Convenient fo sho. Lots of friendly staff. Some homemade pastries that looked tempting. Eggs by the half-crate for ok prices. But I'm holding out for Atherton or the Regional with my local-stuff-stipend.
4	This is my convenient Saturday morning farmer's market stop.  I locavored some delicious grass fed beef here this morning from Salem Hills Farm.  It was so good it begs the question "why ever buy beef at the supermarket again".  I only wish all of the fruits and veggies were that good.  I really like the peripheral sellers (the flower people, the shrimp guy, the grass fed beef) but, it's too bad that most of the produce is not really local/in season, nor are they concerned with providing organics.  One has to go further afield for that and sometimes other priorities conflict.
5	This place is Wonderful!  I can't wait to come back week after week for fresh produce.  They have everything!  Nice setup although parking can be tricky but there is parking on either side of the road.Prices are great, quality and freshness are outstanding.  I prefer getting my fruits, veggies, honey, specialty meats & fresh shrimp here.  I haven't had a reason to buy the fresh cut flower bouquets yet but they are very gorgeous and reasonable.  They also have an assortment of plants, flowers and small bushes & trees.  What more could you ask for AND you get to support our local farmers and growers!
5	The perfect farmers market for those of us uptown!  Gorgeous fruit and veggies, plants, baked goods and awesome prices!  It does get a little crowded on Saturdays so head there around 9am and you will be fine.  There is plenty of parking across the street or next to the gas station.  After you get out of here head over to the Mecklenburg County Market on Harding just a block away.  It has a huge stand for Beverly's gourmet foods and you can NOT pass up her pimento cheese (in the fridge by her veggies).  She still works there sometimes and her dad is almost always there with a super friendly smile.
4	I definitely love this little farmer's market.  They really have a lot of great produce and some pretty decent prices (at least on fruits and veggies).Rarely do I come here that their produce doesn't look just scrumptious.  Most recently, it has been strawberry season, and I have been back quite a few times for their strawberries alone.  I'm not sure if this was just a really good year for them, but they had some really sweet, ripe ones for several weeks (they might still have them, but I didn't go last weekend).  They have a lot of the standard fruits and veggies, with a lot of great-looking local produce.  On the weekends, they have people selling grass-fed beef and eggs, baked goods, and various flora.  For as small as the market is, I feel like they have plenty of cashiers working.  I've never had to stand in really long lines to get my food, which is kind of nice.  However, I often go early in the morning or on weekdays, which might be a little different than later in the day on Friday or Saturday.  The people working are almost always friendly and helpful.  Their parking lot is a bit of a nightmare sometimes when it gets a little busier, and you really have to watch out for people pulling in and out of the parking lot.I'm just sad that this market isn't open year around.
4	Great farmer's market. There aren't that many stalls but of the ones there, everything is of good quality and price. I would recommend getting your fruits and veggies, and remember to save money for some cheap fresh flowers and a little something from the baker's stand. I never wake up early enough, so by the time I get there the meat guy and the shrimp guy are all out. Not great for people who like to sleep in but it's motivation to try some day.
4	Simple and affordable.The King's Drive Farmer's Market isn't fancy and there aren't many unique or exotic items, but I guarantee to your heart's desire there will be copious amounts of your basic fruits and veggies at insanely cheap prices.Everything I've purchased here has been very high quality, I've never been disappointed. Oh, and the cashiers and vendors are super nice and helpful. If you're in the neighborhood and need produce, don't miss a chance to stop by here (make sure you check the hours though).
5	Simply the best place in Charlotte to buy your weekly produce. I usually spend about $10-15/week and I'm STOCKED for the rest of the week. Last time I picked up some green onion, spring mix, eggplant, zucchini, summer squash, asparagus, and mushrooms. Yum! The set-up is not fussy at all and easy to move around. Staff is always super sweet.If you're feeling festive, round it out with some fresh flowers or, if you're lucky, shrimp. I can never catch the shrimp guy. Making it a personal goal of mine.
5	Love this place!  Great veggies, great flowers and always reasonably priced!!Does anyone know when they will start having vegetables again?
4	This is a Cool Farmers Market (NOT Open Year Round)  Lots of "Local" Items, some less than others, still a Fun Cool Market and a Lookalota!Potted Herbs,Tons of Produce!  High Dollar Honey from Monroe,was the most "Local" Honey they had, sugar!  All Vendors are very friendly! Most of the vendors know the whole Market and are helpful to point you in the right direction even if it is someone else's product!Lots of Parking on the Corner lot!
4	Great way to get outside and get something local.The King's Drive Farmer's Market has a lot of your regular produce items: peppers, tomatoes, fresh green beans, potatoes, etc I don't know that I can say i noticed anything really 'unique' there. But if you want local produce that will stock your fridge then this is a good location. They also have grass feed meat, pastries, and other local goodies.Everyone seemed kind and helpful, and I parked in the gravel lot on the side of the market, there are parking attendants to help get everyone in and out safe and quickly. I did stop by the 'grass feed' meat guy and got a huge fatty brisket, he was very informative about where the meat came from and how to prepare it more than one way. If you're nearby during market hours stop by and have a taste!
5	I lookk forward to summer simply for this. I just wish it were open every day!
4	I love this farmer's market! It's so good I drive from the other side of town (passing by several other FMs) just to get here. I love the cantaloupe, watermelon, tomatoes, spring mix, cherries and strawberries! After eating the strawberries here, I can't eat any from a grocery store. I also love the other options available at this market. The seafood guy is excellent. He brings his fresh catches from the week. The scallops are delicious and so are the shrimp. He also has fish, lump crabmeat and peanuts. Sometimes I also treat myself to a bouquet of fresh flowers! They are beautiful and I love the way they make my house smell. Finally, every blue moon, I'll treat myself to a pastry from one of the bakers. My favorite item is the kahlua chocolate cake. Luckily, they sell it by the slice. If I purchased a whole cake I wouldn't have the self control necessary to prevent myself from eating the whole thing in one sitting. The flavor is delicious and the cake is super moist! Great job King's drive!  You keep me coming back for more.
4	One of my favorite farmer's markets and very convenient for the uptown area (I work right across the street). I jsut wish they were open everyday and had card readers. However, now (10/2/2013 and a couple of weeks before) they will be open everyday until the end of October. The pumpkins are out and the lights are up as they will have christmas trees. My favorite time of year! They have all the veggies and fruits you need, honey, jams, fresh seafood, cakes, flowers (arranged and plants), herbs, chicken, whole turkeys, and beef. A little bit of everything. All the staff are very friendly and the place is at it's best early Saturday morning. Come before the seasons out or come back for a Christmas tree!
4	I know this isn't the best farmers market. I know it isn't deserve 5 stars. I know they need more local. I know it is weird to see bananas. I get all of that. BUT THIS PLACE IS SO EASY AND STILL CHEAPER THAN A GROCERY STORE. But, yay, it would rock if they stepped up the local produce section.They have delicious local heirloom tomatoes. That are almost always fresh and perfect.THE FLOWERS. There is a lady who sales the most beautiful fresh cut flowers. Bring extra cash and buy yourself, your girl, your mom some. Absolutely stunning flowers.
5	This place is great if you don't have time to go all the way to the airport. Its rare I spend more than $25. Be sure to bring cash. I usually go on Saturday mornings... but I would like to see what they have during the week.You can't go wrong with fresh and local.
4	The most important thing to note if you come here: bring cash. If you forget rule #1, there is a Wells Fargo just a couple minutes away. Yes, I forgot my own rule yesterday and had to run to the ATM. #embarrassingThis Farmer's Market is open April through September on Tuesday, Fridays and Saturdays. It's open the entire month of October with Fall stuff like pumpkins. End of November through December.... Christmas trees and wreaths.  Plants, flowers, eggs, meats, honey... a ton of different items here. Yes, there's a lot of local produce. They also ship in items... so pay attention to the signs and what you're buying. You know, so you're not telling your friends you bought a locally grown pineapple... :) Good selection and cheap. Items like peppers are such a good deal here. Whenever I make stuffed peppers, I refuse to go anywhere else. Shop local! I love having this option so close and convenient to my 'hood.
