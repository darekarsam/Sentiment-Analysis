4	Energetic young folk zooming around to make our cars nice and clean.
1	I am usually reluctant to complain, but....Today I paid $29.99 for "managers special" which included the works.  Poor job.  Carpets poorly vacuumed, exterior of car still had dirt on it, leather seats not cleaned properly, and the console was filled with water.   Armor-all protectant all over the place and not wiped down properly.  Air freshener that smells like urinal cake.  Pleasant staff, but poor quality work.
5	Great service and staff! If you need your car washed right, this is your spot. New special for $4 wash! No better place!
1	Stay Away!  They damaged my car. If I were you I would not risk taking my car or any other vehicle to auto bell.
