5	Dr. Peers is amazing! Very patient with me through my nervousness. Really takes his time with you. His assistant Freddie is great too- made me laugh- helped me to relax. By far the best dentist i have ever been to! Will never go anywhere else! Thank you Dr. Peers and staff!
5	I came to Dr Peers while I was pregnant and after I gave birth and they were so accommodating to my needs! They also loved the baby and she came with me to my appointments! Dr Peers and his assistant are both very patient, friendly, and made me feel so much more comfortable at the dentist's office. The front desk is friendly, helpful, and professional.
