3	I ate a shitload of breakfast burritos from this place.  I'd recommend the Machaca.  They're only like $4 and it's pretty massive.  I'd say go with the green sauce though the red sauce isn't that bad.  Their chilaquiles were pretty good too but different to what I'm used to.  They were more like wet tacos than actual chilaquiles.  The place itself is sort of small and with not much to offer.  I'd say, get it to go.  Ask for a large cup for the green sauce.
