1	Be careful when shopping here !  Bought an $8,000+ bed.  Delivered broken !  Are you kidding me - not even inspected prior to delivery.  More interested in sales than checking their product.  Poor attention to detail, poor quality.  When selling expensive products ladies and gentlemen, you need to make sure the product is not broken before delivering - check it in the warehouse - rather simple if you really care. No excuse for discovering a broken product in front of a customer.  Buyer beware with these folks.
5	Bought a mattress & box spring from there and the salesman Proctor Freeman was very helpful. He asked us what we needed and we told him and what our price range was. We bought the mattress. Delivery guys called 30mins before delivery and they were really professional in their taking away our old mattress and replacing it with the new one. They even left us mints for us. I highly recommend this place.
5	We purchased Sealy mattress and boxspring from Morgan last week.  He was very polite and helpful.  We had issue with first delivery but he fixed it right away.  Please ask for Morgan for future purchase.
5	My wife and I came in last week to get ourselves a new mattress.  Our salesman, Antwan, was interested in helping us get the right bed, not the most expensive one.  We ended up purchasing one, had it delivered and put into place the next day.  Been sleeping great since then.  Recommend checking them out when your in the market for a new mattress.
