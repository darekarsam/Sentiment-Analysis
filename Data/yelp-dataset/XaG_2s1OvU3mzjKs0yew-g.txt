5	These guys have kept my car up and running and in great shape for over five years. Will NEVER take my vehicles any place else.
2	I was disappointed.  I had my air compressor replaced a year in a half ago and it's already shot. This is after I had spend $1600 on getting it installed.  Now I have to have it replaced - of course they only gave me a 1 year warranty so now its not under warranty.  It's amazing to me how the timing of that happened since it just past expiration of the warranty and died out. For that kind of money I would have thought I would have received a better compressor. I'm taking it elsewhere to have the compressor replaced this time.
2	Well, the customer service is great and the work is spectacular, but their pricing is insane!!! They wanted DOUBLE what most of the other shops wanted for a fairly simple repair.
5	These people are awesome!!! They are HONEST and have excellent customer service!! They look you in the eye and are fair with their prices. What else am I say? They have earned my repeated business
5	I have been bringing my cars here for the last 3 years. In my opinion they are honest, quick, and knowledgeable. I have even begun to have my oil changed here (schedule an appointment) after some shady experiences at Pep Boys. I don't feel comfortable taking my cars anywhere else. Best automotive shop in the East Valley.
