4	I for one like Carl's Jrs and this one is a good representative of the chain. The food is always good and the employees are always helpful and cheerful. They also have free Wi-Fi which is a plus. I just wish the Carl's near my office I frequent for lunch also had free Wi-Fi. They often have someone out on Baseline Rd promoting a Buy one Get one free promo on Western Bacon Cheeseburgers (which are my favorite).
2	It's your typical CJ's. I've giving it two stars because they didn't include a Green Burrito. Shame on you.
1	This customer service is really bad and the food is just as crappy!! Stay away! I have gone there a couple of times and they just don't seem to get the order correct. Will not go back.
5	I love Carls over any other FF resturants in the the area. I like their $6 burger selection and Carls singles. The FF are good but wife like the cuts. Almost every time walking in the door we get a big holler, welcoming us to Carls if the people aren't helping someone. So, with the corners choice of Mc Donalds, sonic, jacks down the street, I choose Carls. Oh I looked at the other few reviews adn i would be upset at a sandwich that looked empty on one side but then I ask where is the other side. Probably not centered well. Oh and talk about little meat go to Subway. the italian sub is like ordering a vegie.
1	I wish I could give zero stars for this Carl's. The customer service is TERRIBLE. In the few times I've been they've overcharged me, gotten my order wrong, and the wait time is the longest I've ever experienced in a fast food drive through. One time the wait was literally 20 minutes. When I had to drive back to get the right order and get a credit for being over charged (2 separate occasions) they didn't even apologize. Total shame because I love Carl's jr food but the service here is not even worth it.
