5	I love the doc (Dr Bozeman) and am excited to try the new massage therapist they just added.  I don't know about pricing bc my insurance covers it and my copay is only $25.
5	My boyfriend and I were referred here by my lawyer due to our car accident and I must say.... I love the employees and doctor here.  Im bummed that my visit with the doctor is now over, but if I do need a chiropractor I will certainly come back.
5	I love this place! My home away from home. I was in two separate car accidents last year about two weeks apart. Both were not my fault. I have a case with my attorney opened and was referred to ace chiropractic. I have been going here for a year now usually one to two times per week. The staff is great! Very friendly and professional. Dr. Bozeman definitely goes the extra mile to make sure you are getting the best care. Not only from his staff but from the rest of the people that you deal with throughout the process of a lean or auto accident. He really cares and helps you understand anything that you may have questions about. I will always recommend ACE CHIROPRACTIC to ALL of my friends and family. I really appreciate everything you guys have done for me. :-)
5	I haven't seen Dr. Bozeman, but Larissa one of the massage therapist's is fantastic! She is very patient and combines massage and stretching. I am a regular and will keep going back. Thank you!I highly recommend her!
2	This place was actually recommended to me by my girlfriend...yikes.  However, as a reviewer previously noted the prices are sky high and the service is mediocre.  It would help if they told you they don't take your insurance and are going to charge you $75 dollars your first visit as a cash off the street patient.  I doubt I will go back.
