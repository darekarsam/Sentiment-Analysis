5	In a recent issue with the courthouse over a proof-of-insurance citation Joe and his staff were very helpful.  They printed everything that I requested (about 7 times) and allowed me to use thier fax machine.  Joe is a very friendly guy.
5	Joe has been taking care of all of my isnsurance needs for many years and his staff has done a great job notifying me ahead of time when something is overdue to avoid any issues. Thnak you Joe!
5	I recently made a agent switch to Joe Lait and wished I had done it many years ago when my former agent passed away and I was given to a new agent which was nothing but a nightmare to deal with and to many mistakes over the years.Joe and his staff is great to deal with and has answered any of my questions in a very timely matter.And Joe has taken care of a matter that my previous agent couldn't figure out how to.Thanks Joe for knowing what your doing in the insurance business and the tips on trying to get fit again at a older age.
