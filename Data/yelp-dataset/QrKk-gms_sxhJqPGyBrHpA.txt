5	Brenda revamped my whole look with swift precision and dauntless commitment to her vision of my hair.  I went from a bleached out blond to a natural highlighted platinum sophisticate.  I recommend Brenda at Hair Touch Studio for any correction or color/skin matching hair processing.
5	This is actually located on the corner of alma school and Elliot. Brenda is the best!! I've had my hair cut and colored many times by many different stylists. I have very high standards and she meets them all! She does great work and charges a reasonable price!
5	So please with my hair color and cut. I was referred by a friend to this salon, my appointment was at 1:30 I was greeted with a warm smile and was sat immediately.  My stylist took the time to understand what I wanted and took the time to walk me through what she was going to do. Great atmosphere and friendly stylist.  Nelly did an amazing job on my hair and I will be making this my permanent go to salon.
