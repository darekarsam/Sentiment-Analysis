5	Really nice atmosphere and decor. I was driving around and found this place. The people are so nice and they do a good job too! Would definitely come back, i've recommended this place to all my girlfriends =)
5	I've tried a number of nail spas in my area, but I always return to Bliss.  Tina and the girls are always pleasant and do a very good job on the pedicures.  Comfortable 'spa' chairs massage your body as you relax and read a magazine supplied by the spa or a book you've brought.  I've been going here for 3-4 years and will continue to give them my business.
4	Nice, clean, relaxing nail salon. I was a walk-in and they were pleasant about it. Good selection of magazines and they played spa music in the background. I would have given 5 stars, but I really had a hard time picking out a polish for my pedicure. The colors were so dark!  There were hardly any bright colors. I wanted something that was fun and cute, not dark and serious. I'll go back, but I'll bring my own bottle of polish with me.
1	This place could be really good if they could attempt to communicate with their customers.***Unfortunately only one day after having my nails done I find that my nail is separating away from  the nail above as she did not put any glue on the nails after she cut them back. This is happening on 8 of my nails, I went back to the store and she just used the drill with emery on them and refused to put any glue on. So my nails will probably be separating very quickly.I will not be going there again.
