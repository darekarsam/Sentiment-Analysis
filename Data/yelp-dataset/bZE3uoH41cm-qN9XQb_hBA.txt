4	Store looks brand new. Plenty of help walking around and refolding clothes. This place is also better stocked than the location on rainbow and lake mead.
5	this store is pretty good sized, very organized, and you can always find someone if you have a question. Very easy to find things.
4	Was surprised to find an old navy here. Very good size and a lot to choose from. Had a good shopping experience the workers were definitely helpful :)
1	Okay. I usually do not care to write a yelp review about a chain store like Old Navy. However, I must make an exception because my experience was AWFUL the other day.The minute I walked in there were two girls folding clothes at the front and they greeted me. They then proceeded to talk very loudly about rude customer experiences they have. (Professional.) They were loud and obnoxious and did not even attempt to be quiet when I would come near them.Then when leaving to check out, one of the same girls (I believe her name was Avery or Aubrey) called me down to check out. I was standing at the counter in front of her and she didnt even greet me...but instead was yelling to another coworker like 6 registers down about how rude the last customer was.ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I usually could care less about a little 17 year old twit working at clothing store. But I just could not believe the unprofessional attitude of all three girls that worked there. I will def not be coming back there!
1	This is the closest old navy to my house and i would rather drive across town to go to the one on Rainbow! Employees are always pretty nice but .... They have a hard time honoring signs that are up in the store and online prices! 1 time ok i understand but i just had my 3rd bad experience. Not a fan !
