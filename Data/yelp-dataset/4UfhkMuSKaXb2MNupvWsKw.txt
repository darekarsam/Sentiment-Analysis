5	Brought some well traveled friends there for a bite since had a craving for sushi that had been lingering for the past 2 months.  Nobody was disappointed. Everything tasted fresh. A lot to select from. Staff was friendly. Very well priced. Like many places you do have to pay for what u don't eat. And we over did it. We payed the little extra to bring it home w us and was still amazing the following day. Needless to say no more sushi craving!!!!!Only negative is that it is a hole in the wall kind of restaurants. But as iv learned they usually are the ones with the best food :)
4	Good sushi for all you can eat, fresh, tasty and well presented. The place is small not ideal for big groups, the service was good, not exceptional but professional. I found it odd that they charged us for our 1 year old daughter ( Ate two bites shrimp tempura and edamame) not a big deal but annoying.
