2	Now I know the idea here is to be a southern style smokehouse. But I hate to be the one to break the bad news to the nice people of Bofingers, but there's more to it than putting meat in a smoker and waiting. I've been to this restaurant two times, and both times I left disappointed. The idea is good, but they didn't succeed in creating something memorable.
3	Had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. When I was done, I wanted another one. Foodwise, I think that says it all. On the negative side, there was only one server for lunch times. It's not his fault he can't handle everyone. He was very personable and sincerely apologetic. Owners need to have 2 people on the floor over lunch rushes. This server, however, did something that I just can't stand. My guest and I ordered the same meal (different sauces). Instead of entering both purchases in the cash, he entered one, we paid, and then he printed a duplicate receipt for the other one. Same receipt number, same items, printed "reimpression" on the bottom." Laziness, or another way to try to get around the mandatory receipts and recording law in Quebec restaurants? I didn't catch it until I left the premises, so I couldn't call them out, but this is getting really annoying. 5 stars for the food minus 1 for the bad business decision, and minus 1 more for the receipt issue. Customers must come first and laws must be followed to get full marks, even though the food was excellent.
4	Been there a few times for lunch. Served quickly and efficiently.I've had numerous meal options such as the pulled pork, the club sandwich, philysteak, burgers... never was disappointed. Nothing blew my mind away but for a quick decent priced lunch it truly hits the spot.American styled resto that is one of my secret hidden gems in Montreal that I've started to slowly share with coworkers and friends.Personal favorite? The club sammich. That thing is TASTY and HUUUGE.
