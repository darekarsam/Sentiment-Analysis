2	I has such high hopes but was sadly disappointed. Even though the price was reasonable I wouldn't  recommend this place. It's in a scary neighborhood. I didn't feel safe. There were cobwebs in my room above the tv. Hair on the toilet and the hair dryer. Cleaning staff obviously didn't check the tissues because I took one and the box was empty. I called front desk and was told come get a box. Didn't offer to bring me one. That totally pisses me off. Stains on the bedspread. Phone wasn't plugged in. When I went to plug it in I found a bunch of chips/crumbs beside the nightstand. I cringed when I saw the crap behind the nightstand. It's never been vacuumed. Hot tub was only warm.I think you get the picture.
4	My wife and I stayed here for one night while I had to attend business at the Mesa courthouse just a block away.We paid roughly $50 for the night and I would say the room and hotel quality for that price is outstanding.  That being said, it is not perfect.  There were stains in the bedding and carpet.  Our room coffee maker did not percolate.  It was even unplugged, as if someone knew it didn't work but it was never attended to by management.Check-in/check-out was a breeze and parking was plentiful.  The street in front of the hotel (Main St.) is undergoing heavy construction so there are no left-turns out of the hotel for instance.
