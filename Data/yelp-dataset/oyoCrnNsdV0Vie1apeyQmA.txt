4	I love the furniture here! We went in looking for a coffee table and a large ottoman.  Pricey but all of the pieces are unique. Place was not busy and sales people did not circle you like road kill. They also didnt say hello, so I took a star. We were able to browse through and didnt have any questions so it didn't bother me that they didnt greet us. Large and small pieces to go in any room. Looked like they had a design center. Didn't find the perfect piece today.
5	LuLu, the sales person made all the difference.  She listened to my concerns.  These concerns and considerations registered against her understanding of her inventory.  The correct chair was purchased and delivered as promised.LuLu comprehends limited time to shop, as I am "busy, busy, busy".  Price was advantageous, but not a giveaway.  They do have an admirable selection of clearance chairs that are totally suitable.
