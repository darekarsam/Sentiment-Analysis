1	This review is about Terminix company in general.All this company really cares about is making money any way they can. They didn't care about any pest problem and if you want a guarantee of their services you have to pay extra! I would get a call about every month asking me if I wanted to upgrade my service so that I could be "protected" and they always asked me "why" when I told them NO. During my last month of service they called me to inform me that the credit card they had on file had expired and I needed to provide them with the new expiration date. At the time I didn't have the card with me and they said they would call back before my next scheduled service. Nobody ever called. And since I never gave them the new expiration, they didn't even bother coming to do any pest control or even call! I have now switched to Alpha Ecological Pest Control and they seem to provide a much better customer service and their products are all kid/pet friendly, which is very important to me.
1	Schedule appointment for today..... NO CALL NO SHOW.... When I called to find out whats going on . Find out it was not setup right! WTH.. You show it in the computer but it's not setup right. No help at all. "Makes me even more mad the guy called to make sure the time and day was still good". Took part of the day off to wait for this person. Guess I will be looking for another bug person =(
1	The company I used was bought by them.  Everything about Terminix is horrible.  The only way to get them to stop charging my credit card was to let it expire.  Horrible all around.
3	Had a frustrating problem with my billing.  Spoke w/ a very NOT nice person from Atlanta I think... Was called by a local Tempe manager and it was resolved.  Thank you.
