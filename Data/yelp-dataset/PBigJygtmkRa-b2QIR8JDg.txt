5	Great flowers
5	April's Florist has turned my husband into a believer of sending flowers!!!!  The online ordering system is easy to use, delivery is fast and the flowers are beautiful.  You definitely get your money's worth with her large beautiful arrangements.  Once April was out of a certain vase for what my husband ordered, so she called him and acted like it was a big deal (she could have said nothing and we would have never known) and upgraded the arrangement.  Beautiful flowers, great customer service!!!
5	I used April's Florist for my wedding, seven years ago. She did a wonderful job. Worked with me on price, design, etc. Everything was wonderful and she was fun to talk and plan with. More recently, I went to her to help my friend with planning for funeral flowers/arrangements. She worked with us and helped us decide on a budget-friendly and beautiful set of flowers, sprays, etc. They were so pretty. April's is my go-to place for flowers.
