1	This place is disgusting, and you get nickled and dimed to only get attitude from a staff. This place is a joke.
1	OK location, but the management is a joke.  Seriously lacking in customer service, follow-through and overall professionalism.
1	Ive had scorpions in the apartment and the tenant who lives above me said he gets a quite a few each month and has been stung multiple times.Management (Andris) is horrible and non-caring. They are almost never in the office during their business hours, and if you try to call them to deal with an issue instead, don't expect a return call from them.Only one way in or out of the gated parking lot and one evening the gate broke. No one could get in or out for over 2hrs until the emergency maintenance crew (who live off site), got there. When i viewed the apartment, they had potpourri going, that should have been my first clue not to lease. Te buildings are old and smell as such no matter what. The guy above me is a chain smoker and it leaks into my apartment via the air ducts.I told the leasing agent i only wanted a 9 month lease but when the papers were drawn up, they changed it to 12 months. It was my fault for not correcting it, but no I want out of the lease after 9 months and they could care less about my reasons for needing to move.  If there were a way to put no stars, I would!Do not rent an apartment here!
2	They Price-Gouge when you renew your lease. 10 - 12  weeks before your lease expires they send a renewal notice with the new higher lease rate. This rate is only good for 2 weeks then it expires. The next renewal notice is for Higher lease rate - good for 2 weeks. A total of 5 renewal notices / rate increases before the original lease expired!  The final renewal notice for highest rate will cost you an additional $250 - $300 per year. I submit that  this practice is a form of Predatory Leasing and may even be grounds for a class action lawsuit. Anyone interested?
