5	Teresa did the alterations on my wedding dress and the fit was perfect!  I was operating under a tight deadline and appreciated Teresa's flexibility.  Prices are very reasonable.
1	Horrible experience.   I bought my daughter a very expensive designer dress for a formal dance at her school.  We went and my daughter tried it on.  She said come back in ten days and ill have it hemmed.  She told me ot would be 90 dollars for the hem which is ridiculous but I just said I would pay it.  Twice as much as what ive paid for hem before.  But I picked her because she was close to our home.  So my daughter just came back inn tear...the dance is Saturday night,,,its Thursday night now and the dress was seriously messed up.  The hem wasn't even and she made the front way to short and didn't just hem it but cut it short.  Plus jewels fell off the dress and it was just a horrible experience and now she is late getting it back to us.  Hopefully she has it somewhat fixed tomorrow.  I wont pay in full for a service done this way or for a late dress.  Very very displeased!
