5	These guys are awesome! Formerly AutoTech and now Meineke. Same staff as before and same great service.   Over the past year I have taken 3 of my vehicles to them for check engine light issues and all three times the issue was fixed, car was road tested and then smogged all in the same visit. Good price, No upselling, no BS. Tim is great to work with and keeps you posted every step of the way. I wish more repair shops did business like this.
1	Being that i'm not from this area, i trusted yelp and had high hopes for this place after reading the reviews. I had set an appointment here two days in advance for 7:30 in the morning. The day of my appointment I showed up to this place exactly on time, yet to my surprise the place didn't even open until 8. So then I waited 30 minutes outside then headed inside to have the owner tell me my appointment wasn't even booked. To top it off, he tells me it would take 3-4 hours to get the car parts I needed. Not once did he ever apologize for any mishaps nor did he try to suggest any other places that would be of more help until i asked for myself. In addition, not only did I waste my time but I had an owner by the name of Tim that failed to compensate for my horrible experience. I would suggest that people don't waste their money here.
