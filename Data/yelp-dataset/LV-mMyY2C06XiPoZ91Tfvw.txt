5	There is nothing in the world like your home Starbucks. When I moved to Virginia in 1996 I drove 30 miles one way to get to a Starbucks. I had tears in my eyes when I got there I was so happy to have found it. Every morning since 2004, just before work, I cross over Boulder Highway and make the most important stop of the day, MY STARBUCKS ; ). Many of the people have changed and I am still friends on facebook with some of them. It warms the cockles of my heart to see familiar faces in the mornings. Sometimes it is the best part of my day. So I have to give kudos to my present home team: Andy, he's the manager, Erica, Ashlee, Alex, Bekka, Melissa and Lupe. I am welcomed every morning with a "Hi Jodie" and my coffee is waiting for me. That's more than I get sometimes from people I spend a lot of time with. I have even created a new Starbucks business on Yelp because no one has ever written a review for this specific Starbucks. So, home team....... here's to YOU! You rock!
2	Good thing is: no line.  But bad thing is it's the dirtiest Starbucks I've ever been in. Floor was filthy, behind the counter and throughout the seating area, trash was everywhere.  Counter was sticky, newspapers strewn everywhere. I've never in my life seen a Starbucks so dirty (and I've been in many).

4	I know, I know, I'm the only person in Nevada I think that drinks Decaf. But anyways, here they make it where it tastes like coffee. Not like watered-down coffee. When Lupe is working the counter, there is always a good smile to start your morning. The sausage egg and cheese on English muffin is really good too.
