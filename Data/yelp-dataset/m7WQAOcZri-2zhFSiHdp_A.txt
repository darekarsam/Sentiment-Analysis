4	This J&J is located right next to the Gold's Gym I frequent in my neighborhood and I usually come here specifically for Quest bars when I run out, which seems to be a lot.  I normally get my supps at a different nutrition shop, but J&J is just convenient when I need some item immediately.  Have you ever had a Quest bar?  I rely on them when I need portable protein without a lot of carbs, calories, or fat.  Plus, they come in tasty flavors, my favorites being Coconut Cashew, Cinnamon Roll, and Mixed Berry.  They just released Cookies n Cream today, so I'll be heading over to get a couple of bars.  They are always friendly here and will price match, but I haven't used that service as of yet.  If you're in the market for vitamins, protein, supplements, or Quest bars, give J&J a try.
5	Great place for any supplement needs! They by far have the best selection & best prices, and the staff is great & knowledgeable :) my go-to place for quest bars.
5	Good selection of products and drinks.  Convenient location, fair prices, friendly staff make this place one of my Vegas standby businesses.  Advice on supplements is unbiased and accurate.  Lots of  parking.  Accept all major credit cards.
3	Locally owned vitamin shop with several shelves a single-bottle deep of carefully-selected brands. They carry several varieties of protein powder and body building supplements but I found it irritating that of their three brands of vitamins, many of the lines don't carry the same product- so if you need CalMag, for example, you really only have a single option. Fund it odd that many products only had a single bottle on the shelf, and though the spots for each bottle were labeled most lacked a price tag.Staff looked bored out of their mind, wandered the store for several minutes before a vague, "Finding everything okay?" was called out. Well-located at a busy intersection with a Golds Gym in the plaza, but they could use a boost in both inventory and service.
