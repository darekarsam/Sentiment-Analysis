2	I went here for an eyebrow wax and a pedicure and I definitely came out in more pain than when I went in (sure that's not what spas are for?!?). Anyway one of my eyebrows is really badly burned and swollen. I also got one of my toes knicked by the clippers which really hurt but the girl didn't even seem that fussed by. Oh and two of my toes came out bleeding at the bottom of the nail. The girls in the spa are friendly enough most of the time (although at other times very  miserable) but the quality of the treatments has gone seriously downhill. I used to go here once a month for a few years as a treat to myself so feel I am in a good position to now judge how poor everything has got. It definitely feels more like a conveyor belt.
