5	I couldn't have gotten better service. The husband wife duo really make you feel welcome and their workmanship is top notch. I couldn't have asked for a better company to tint my Mini Cooper.
5	It doesn't get any better.  Very friendly place.  You are treated as a valuable customer whose needs come first to help with scheduling. Never having my windows in any car tinted I was grateful for their explanation of the different tints available.  I had such a wonderful experience here that I am taking my friend to have her car done as a birthday present.  Also very reasonably priced.  Thinking of tinting...this is the place to go.
5	My tint job is pretty new, so I don't have a long-term quality review (yet).  I called these guys and they seemed pretty firm and confident about their quality and the fact that they didn't fool around with inferior quality films, and also that their technicians were very experienced. They called the day before my appointment to confirm.When I arrived, they consulted me on the best combination of tinting (shades) for my vehicle. There was a little bit of an upsell for additional work, but it wasn't high pressure. The tint job itself looks very sharp, and I bought a luxury vehicle so I was very sensitive about the quality. The upsell items ended up being really helpful, so that's awesome.I'd definitely recommend Millennium Tints to my friends and family.
5	They make you feel welcome and that your business is important, questions answered, tint options and plusses/minuses are discussed, the work was fast, professionally completed and the finished work looks terrific.  Mini Cooper, three rear and two side windows executed as desired.  Will now take my Jeep there to repair damage to the selling dealer's less professional application.Recommend Millennium Tints.
