5	Great staff always willing to help.  They make it a point to always say hello whenever you walk in the door.  The pharmacy staff is always willing helpful with any questions I have.  Love my neighborhood Walgreens!
3	It was clean, I found exactly what I needed but I feel as if employees should have acknowledged us.  No one acknowledged us we walked around.Then the cashier made us wait to cash out until she was done talking on the phone.  I understand that is probably part of her responsibilities but at least give the obligatory gesture to let us know you see us.I'm glad this isn't my regular location.
1	This is THE WORST walgreens i have ever been to. Every single time I go, there is a huge line of people and ONE register open. The cashiers are moving as slow as possible... I can't.
