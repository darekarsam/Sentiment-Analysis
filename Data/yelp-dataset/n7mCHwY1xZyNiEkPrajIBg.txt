4	Excellent coffee and great service!
4	I freaking love their coffee!  it's my favorite coffee spot in the S Hills.  The place is very clean and the staff is very friendly too.
4	Tucked away in a strip mall, super sweet/friendly Barista on the Monday morning we stopped in. (July 7th)Excited there's finally a coffee shop in the plaza!!  When I'm in town visiting relatives, I now have a place to pick up a spot of 'joe that's not over on insanely busy Brownsville Rd.
5	This is one if my favorite coffee shops. It is family owned and operated. Their coffee is always fresh brewed and strong. I've had regular coffee, lattes, and iced coffees. I've never been disappointed. They also offer pie slices, cookies, and a few other goodies. I haven't tried any of them but I've heard people say they are good. They have a few small tables to sit at but I'm usually grabbing my coffee to go. Nice people, nice place, great coffee.
5	Best coffee around! Located in Caste Village, my favorite coffee shop. Always a perfect cup of coffee.
