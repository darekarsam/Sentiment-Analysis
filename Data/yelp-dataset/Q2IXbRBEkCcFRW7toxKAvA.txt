1	After years of clogging the arteries and shortening the lives of local patrons, KFC has closed their doors forever!
1	I know what to expect when I'm in mood for fried chicken, so I don't give ratings based on the food quality. However, the service was really too slow, and the chicken were so dry that they were almost powder. Ok not powder but dry and tasteless. Horrible.
3	This is a KFC , no big deal if you're outside Montreal.But seeing as how it's one just a handful left here, they must be cherished as I get the feeling they'll disappear altogether.This location actually has seating,parking and they deliver.They are in desperate need of renovations though.The chicken is killer, nicely fried to greasy goodness. The fries are normally a letdown but the sandwiches are pretty good for fast food.KFC is known for their $2 Tuesdays (now$3), but they have a lot of good deals most days.
