5	The wife and I ate lunch here today. As soon as we walked in the door we were greated. We ordered our food and had it in just a few minutes. The entire staff seemed very friendly. We opened our bags and were surprised to see a double burger and enough fries for 3 people. The burger was so juicy I had the juice running down my chin. I am not sure who makes the buns but I would love to know so I could use them at home. The fries were also excellent and like I said, there were a lot of them. The only thing is, I wish they had onion rings. It would be a nice change from eating fries all the time.
5	Love their burgers and fries!!! Everything is so fresh.
3	For the record, we are long time Five Guys fans.  Eat there regularly.But why is it that this one seems to specialize in goofing up some part of our order when we do take out?  You shouldn't have to open up your packages before leaving the restaurant to ensure everything is 1) there and 2) accurate.  But this location makes you rethink that.  :-(
