5	Was referred to Najib's Barber shop through a friend.He always cuts my hair exactly how I want it.  I've been getting my fades from Najib for the last 8 years.His new spot is big and comfy and a good place to chill even if I'm not getting a fade.  I recommend him to everyone.
5	NYCe cuts is my new barber! Najib has once again set up shop in the north valley. Place is big, clean, relaxed, and respectful. I have been looking for a good Barber for years. I met Najib at another shop that I didn't care for. He went into business for himself and brought Craig and Gina with him, Smart move! Great prices, cuts and people!!
