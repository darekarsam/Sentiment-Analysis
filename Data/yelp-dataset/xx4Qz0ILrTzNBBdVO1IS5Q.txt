5	Safer to drive to the one on 1121 Las Vegas Blvd, It's very open and lit up like the 4th of July.
4	Great branch, usually really nice inside. Occasional bum strolls in and smells up the place a little... But it is on Las Vegas Blvd so what should you expect. Staff is very nice and kinda knowledgable, although I've had a couple times where they acted like they knew something when they didn't... I'm sure that's the exception not the rule though... Nice branch overall.
3	The staff was very helpful but I have a joint business account and when I wanted to close half of my accounts the staff didn't ask for anything from my partner. So basically I was able to close all my business accounts and take all my money without my partner's approval.Although they are nice they need to have some training on procedures and controls. Luckily my business partner and I trust each other but if you don't then I wouldn't suggest using them.
