4	Free vacuums, very affordable prices for a self service car wash and very clean. If you are in a budget this is the place to go and have your car shinning. They offer a monthly and year pass for a flat fee unlimited washes or a single $5 for one time wash. I really like it. The only bad thing about it its the rail in the car wash that's why i did not gave them the full 5 star rating.
5	Nice and clean car wash. Prices are in one of the photos. Free self serve vacuum. Prices are good and you save water!
5	Free Vacuum, Clean and en-expensive! Perfect!But Please folk, pull your pants up and turn your flippin radio down, we all don't share your tastes in music or underwear!
5	Very friendly and helpful staff!  Clean and affordable!  I recently purchased their monthly membership and I love it!!
5	This is a family owned and operated business which is supervised and staffed by people who care. Affordable and convenient!
5	For an affordable Car Wash this place is GREAT. Free Vacuum and a monthly plan that is under what you would pay for two washes. I love it.
1	My car was damage when they took off the sticker off my windshield. They scrape off my windshield tint and refuse to take responsibility. I was paying for the car wash every month without the sticker.  I've talked to the owner which refused to take responsibility. I do not rememend anybody to this place who takes advantage of hard working people. I give them a one star because the owner is a crook and a lair.
5	i love this carwash... i am very OCD so i prefer to vacuum my car myself, i like how i can take my time vacuuming... cleans my car well and i wipe it myself so i can be sure its very clean and streak free. My only complain are the other people washing their car and blasting music... put on some headphones because not everyone enjoys your taste in music !!!
