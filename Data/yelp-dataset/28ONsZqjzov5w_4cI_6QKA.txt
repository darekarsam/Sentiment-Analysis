5	We've had Capitol Plumbing out at our place twice now, and each time they surpass our expectations. We've been truly pleased with the friendly, prompt, reasonably priced service. They even answer the phone after 5pm on a Friday, and show up the next day first thing! I will definitely recommend them to friends & family.
5	Called this morning after I noticed my outside spigot was leaking and frozen.  Stan was very friendly and sent a team within 30 minutes.  The two guys who arrived were great and finished the repair quickly.  The talked to me in advance of doing any work and even provided cost estimates. Discussed options were and helped me decide the best course.  The cost was reasonable and I will definitely call again if I need plumbing work.Thanks - Christine
5	Capitol Plumbing has helped me out twice this month, once to install a water heater and then to come replace an outside spigot. Both repairmen who came out were friendly, professional, and thorough. I'm glad to recommend Capitol Plumbing!
