5	Went here tonight for tattoo #2. Was really impressed with the studio and the staff. Super friendly and offer prices up front. Amy did a beautiful job on my tattoo and was very personable. She made me feel comfortable and took her time, pausing if I needed a break.Highly recommend checking it out if you live in the south hills area!
5	Great work! Couldn't be happier with Amy!  I've been to other places and I am happy to have found The Pittsburgh Tattoo Studio!  Extremely clean environment!!!!   Thank you for the great work!!!!!!
5	First let me just say how clean it was when I walked in the door! It was an immediate sigh of relief. I was able to get am appointment with short notice which was great.  Very friendly staff. Loved the artwork on the walls. Everything in the front of the studio was so nice. Then I met Amy. You could tell that she was a very professional girl who knew what she was doing. That also put me at ease. (This was only my second tattoo. First experience was kind of a mess). The whole process only took a half hour for my tiny tat and it went perfectly. Love my little cupcake. Will definitely go back for any other tattoos that I'll get and will refer Amy to anyone who asks me where I go.
