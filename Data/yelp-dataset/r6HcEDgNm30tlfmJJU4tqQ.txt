5	I was in town for the holiday and wanted to get.a prescription refilled. They did the testing required and I got my prescription. I didn't have to wait long and the staff and doctor was great. I'd go again.
5	TALOFA:My son and I both weren't feeling well. I decided to go to West Valley Urgent Care instead of waiting to see my Pcp. The first thing I noticed was the reception / waiting room/area was very clean and had a friendly  vibe to it. ( I  generally don't like clinics or doctor offices ) We checked in ...the staff was both  friendly and very professional . We waited decent  amount of wait time(considering we were a walk in).  We were seen by Dr  James McAvoy Jr  aka Jim who btw the first thing he did was apologize to us for the waiting (which wasn't that long). Dr McAvoy was AWESOME, really knowledgeable and made me and my son feel comfortable throughout the appointment!  My family and I would definitely  go back for any urgent  health issues in the future  and all highly recommend this medical group. I give west valley  urgent care 5 stars.  Keep up the great work.
5	I've been going here for almost 2 years. The staff here is very professional and I absolutely love Dr. James McAvoy. He is always concerned with my health and is willing to do anything in his power to help me feel better. Also, if you don't have insurance,  this place is by far the cheapest you will pay out of pocket.
