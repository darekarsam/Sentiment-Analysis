5	I'm pretty confident they really do have the lowest gas prices in Vegas.  Corner of Buffalo & Sahara.
5	I love this place. I know its just a corner store but it is the best gas experience possible. I walk in and the employees greet me with a smile and actually engage the customer. They make it a more enjoyable experience. They don't have a liquor license yet but I've been told they're working on it. The prices are low and good quality. I like that its local. Its always clean and the window wash station is awesome. It has adjustable handles for people who can reach across. All around this place is worth going to if your in the neighborhood.
3	Gas prices are decent, but not the lowest as advertised. They don't take manufacturers cigarette coupons, carry Rock Star drinks or have many diet soft drink options; but hey, they're still new. They may improve. It's no skin off my nose either way. There's plenty of gas options within a mile radius.
