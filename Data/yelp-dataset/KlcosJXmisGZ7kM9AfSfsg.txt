1	Do NOT go here. The doctors are good enough but the wait time to get in the room is at least 30 minutes each time. Check in: 10:35, appt time: 10:45, time now 11:27. KMN! Update: they called and said I couldn't be seen there because I had missed 1 appointment in 2009 and 2010 and and 2013. How rude is that? No customer relations at all.
4	My family has been going to DFMoGV for about six years now. We always see their PA, Ginger Lane, and she is fantastic. She really spends the time to get to know you, research what your issue is, and I just don't have enough nice things to say about her. Four stars because the office staff tends to be a little rude sometimes and there can be long wait periods but that's easily remedied by getting an early morning appointment.I recommend this practice to all my friends.
3	I enjoy coming here I can sometimes get an appointment within 2 days I always see ginger lane she's really good makes me feel comfortable I called Monday 10/2214 to make an appointment and I didn't get through till 3 hours later which is ridiculous they need another appointment scheduler and the staff is rude at times ..,,
4	No one ever enjoys having to go to the doctor, but when you have to go, you have to go. I managed to scour the yelp listings and found my way to calling their office for an appointment. They did not have an immediate appointment available, but we were able to schedule one for the following day. I see Ginger Lane, and have not seen any of the doctors there.She has great bedside manner and was directing her advice toward me.
