1	Horrible company! Did not complete installation, installer did not even use plastic, and a 2-4 day job is now going over a week! They also delete bad reviews of themselves from Facebook! Dan (owner) is a liar himself in that he promised to call us back and satisfy his customers. He is a dishonest man and runs a dishonest company!!!NEVER use this company!!!
5	My husband and I had slate installed in our bathroom last month and we love it!! The installers arrived on time covered everything in plastic and went to work. Within a few hrs the install was done and the bathroom looks amazing. Needless to say we will be contacting them again next year to install slate through the rest of the house!!! Thanks Dan, you have outstanding customer service!!!
4	Used Beyond Stone Solutions to seal and screen my travertine tile 2600 +sq. ft.and a Mexican tile shower.Crew worked 2 days and results were not exactly as I thought it would be. Filed outsurvey  with some of my comments, 2 days later I receive a call from Dan (owner) to discuss my comments. He said he would come to house and look atfloor and shower. Dan explained the reason for some tiles not looking as I thought would look after the screening process.Dan said we will send another crew and "we will not leave until you are completely satisfied with floor and shower.".Dan not only sent a crew, he himself came to house to check progress.Dan should write the manually for" customer service" for other service companies. He stands by his products and service. I could not be happier with his follow up and his regard for my total satisfaction.I would definitely  recommend Beyond Stone Solutions to my friends.             Peter             Scottsdale Az.
