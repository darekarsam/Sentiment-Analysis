1	This place while cheap is horrible. The cocktail sauce is completely watered down and all the food is just frozen food that's been thrown in the deep fryer. The service was fine but this place is far from what you would consider a decent fish and chips place. Avoid this place. I should have tried Rice to You (next door) instead.
1	I know a lot of people might be fake on here, but I'm far from that. If i could literally give them a negative star i would. I wanted fish & chips and this was the closet to me so i said ok let's try it. I walked in and it needed a major upgrade, however some places that look horrible are sometimes the best places. Not this place, i placed my order $16.71. I sat down and as i waited i saw a cockroach run across the floor. I got up and without making a scene told the girl at the register that i would like my money back please cuz of the roach. She tried to tell me that their clean but i told her no i saw what i saw and i want my money back, i paid with my debit but they did give me cash so that was good. But yes this place is no good
