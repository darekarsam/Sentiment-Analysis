5	My daughter is 4 and goes here. She loves it and they are very clean and have great class structure. Teachers are very nice as well as the staff. They have a nice playground area with shade. She just had her graduation ceremony and they went all out in a huge church auditorium, caps, gowns, graduation songs and the whole nine. My daughter also uses the dance classes they offer. Only 10 dollars a class, and they put on an amazing and very creative recital. I highly recommend Creative Kids.
5	My two daughters have been going here since 2010.  My youngest is moving on from Pre-K to Kindergarten this year.  We used Creative Kids for both pre-school and after-school care and have been very happy with the quality of care and teaching our daughters have received.  My oldest daughter did full-day kindergarten this year and Creative Kids had her prepped well for Givens Elementary full-day kindergarten.I recommend this Creative Kids to all my friends and co-workers looking for childcare.We will probably try Safe-Key this year as our daughters are older now and we have family in-town often that watches them, but if it is not a fit then we will go back to Creative Kids.  (Safe-Key allows you to pay by the day, and if Creative Kids had that option then we would be staying put, but for our family paying by the day is a significant savings due to all the days we do not need childcare.)
