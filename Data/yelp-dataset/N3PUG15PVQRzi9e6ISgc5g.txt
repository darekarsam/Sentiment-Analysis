4	I know Donatos is a chain, but I continue to be impressed by this particular location on Park Road. Located next to Ed's Tavern, they have great specials. $8.99 bakery style pizza with 3 toppings. Think pan style pizza. 16 square slices for $9?! Awesome. For take out, expect 15 min and delivery 30 min. That's for Southend area. Staff is friendly too.
4	"You Can't Always Get What You Want " used to be the song I sang when thinking of Donato's. I craved it all the time yet it hadn't made its way down to NC yet but insisted my sister order it every time I went up to Indiana. Fast forward a few years and we have it in Charlotte-woo hoo! Except I didn't have it until tonight. Not in the mood to cook, I took the lazy way out and ordered online.I didn't want a huge pizza but ordered two individual pizzas (one so I can enjoy later this wk) and love that you can get the think crust on the individuals as well. Got the confirmation email from them-order would be ready in 15 minutes for pick up and bam, it was in my hands 15 minutes later. Still the same gooey, cheesy, heavenly pie that I've been accustomed to in the past. They offer mad coupons in the Wednesday flier and have a few coupons in the Citipass book as well.

1	I had horribly late Donatos pizza about a month ago. The highlight was a conversation on the phone with Justin (Manager) that led me to believe that he hates his life.I called corporate and left a message detailing the problem, but they never got back to me.
5	the apple crisp pizza desert.   gotta be the best pizza ever.   wow love it.   wife says we can't buy pizza anymore unless we get this apple pizza.fyi:   my opinion....even without the apple pizza, this is the best pizza joint in charlotte
