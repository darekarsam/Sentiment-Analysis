5	I received most excellent customerservice here - and Im not even a customer! From the time I walked in the door til the time I left, I was made to feel welcome. The girl, joanna, who helped me out, made it way easier on me as i was cashing a check made out tothis bank and there are all kinds of internal procedures for that. If i decide to get a bank account, itll probably be here. Kudos to wells fargo for stepping up their game!
5	This bank gets a total of five stars from me. They are professional and on point. I love this wells fargo in my book its the best location in vegas.
1	This branch has a very unprofessional staff. My spouse & I are both going to switch banks due to very poor customer service!! Tellers are rude, very young, do not care about the customer at all.
2	Long wait for a banker at 9:30 in the morning. There are almost no customers here. But no available bankers as well. There are no greeters to help incoming people as in other WF branches.
5	Been in this branch a couple of times now and the staff is always nice and very helpful
5	Very friendly staff. Little to no wait time. Helped me quickly get a replacement bank card when mine came up missing. Very easy to work with.
5	My visit at this Wells Fargo was phenomenal !!! I was lucky to work with Yesenia Rodriguez, she was extremely professional & helpful! She helped me open a new credit card and was able to flawlessly answer all my questions!!! She went above and beyond to help make my experience wonderful!! Thank you so much your time was greatly appreciated.
