4	Wonderful food staff is friendly and efficient I would definitely do it again portions are big prices are good
3	We came in for breakfast, not bad but not exceptional either. This is small place so I wouldn't bring more than a group of 6. Staff is really friendly. I will try them again another time.
5	Been here 4-5 times and every time it's been great.  Everyone i ate with  complemented on how good the food is and the service. Very friendly and attentive staff. I love the breakfast and also the cheesesteak for lunch.
4	Just tried to go there this morning.  Looks like it's closed... Permanently.Update I reached out to them and they have a new address. "We have moved over to our other location just a half mile down the street! 945 e scenic drive."
4	No longer is it Skies restaurant,  It's now Linda's Hossier cafe. Great food, great prices, and great service. They just opened Monday October 27th the employs are still learning the menu, I've been eating here since Monday and the food and service has been great. I do suggest coming on a Friday night and having the fried fish with French fries and or onion rings with some really good coleslaw and a nice warm dinner roll. Really good place to eat.
