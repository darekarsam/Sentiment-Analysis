3	In terms of fast food pizza, Howie's is probably my drug of choice. Their prices are fair and the flavored crusts are pretty good. I also like the sandwiches or maybe a greek salad if I'm feeling lazy but want something a bit more green.
1	Cold, slow, overpriced dont waste your $$ ordered online for a 6pm delivery, 6:25 it finally arrived my 2 year old was able to bite into it immediately if we need a temperature description. Got two medium pizzas and 10 wings. Wings weren't bad but $30 down the drain pizza in the trash
5	I don't do the pizza thing anymore (vegan) but my husband loves this pizza! Plus, the employees are ALWAYS friendly. I just wish they delivered one block further so I don't have to pick up my order every time :)
4	I am always so surprised at how good the pizza is from here. It's a last resort usually when me and my room mates get pizza here but it is always on point. I feel like this is a step above little Caesars even though the prices are similar.
1	Every time I check yelp for their hours I show up and they are closed. Today the sign was on door open and employees were sitting behind the counter eating and talking then tell me that they are closed despite yelp and their sign saying they were open. Doubt I'll be coming back for this horrible service.UpdateCame to In and Out on camelback & 101 received great service. Next time come here first.
