1	I have placed several orders at this location, only to find out after a month of living at that apartment that some (most) of the delivery staff seem to smoke in their delivery vehicles.The box of the last order I placed reeked of smoke.In subsequent weeks when I saw Papa John's delivering other pizzas to neighbors the delivery staff was almost always smoking in the car when they pulled in.Nasty, unhealthy, and have not ordered from this Papa John's in well over a year nor will I ever again.

1	I called to order a large buffalo chicken pizza with an order of 4 bread sticks and a 2-liter soda. (a special they had advertised) I requested when ordering the pizza, that it be cut in squares, not pie shaped wedges, and was informed this was "Chicago style", so clearly the guy understood what I was asking. When I arrived, I made the huge mistake of not checking the pizza or bread sticks although the amount I was charged should have warned me they screwed up. I got to my office and 1) the pizza was not cut into squares, but was sloppily cut into pie shaped wedges and 2) I had a dozen bread sticks - way more than 4 according to my math. Adding more insult, there was a cobweb in the corner of the box holding my bread sticks and a teeny tiny spider dangling as I lifted the lid. Ewe!Will I ever order from the Urbana Papa Johns again? Really? You had to ask? Not only did they clearly NOT listen to or care about a damn thing I said on the phone when placing my order, but spiders in the boxes? I understand workers put the boxes together in their 'slow time' so they have them ready to go when they get busy, but come on.....have you heard of CLEANING? Shut it down!
1	Ordered a pizza at night. Didn't let me know they were closed. Checked later they said they'd deliver at 11:00am. They didn't let me cancel. This place blows.
