5	Nice place. They will take care of you while you watch the game. Can't beat the prices for the kind of cut they offer, so tip them well.
1	Tried this place several times at different locations, overall the worst place to get a hair cut, would travel to Scottsdale and pay the same price  for better service and better barbers. 3 strikes.
4	My husband come here when his usual barber was not available. I was convenient because they are right around the corner from us. They always seem to be busy but there's so many barbers that it goes by fast. My husband was pleased with his cut which is rare. The prices are a little steep though but I guess it's that way at all barbers. The problem is that you always get a different barber so you are kinda rolling the dice on how your cut comes out
