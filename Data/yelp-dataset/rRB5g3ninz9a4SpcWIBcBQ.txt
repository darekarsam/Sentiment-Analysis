5	Wow!  Like costco meets cabelas.  Great customer service, huge store, prices seemed great to me.
5	I like this store.  I don't want to say they have everything, but they sure have a lot of stuff.  Oddly the thing I like the most is their selection of nuts/bolts/screws/etc.  If you ever need that odd nut/bolt/screw/etc to fix something around the house this is the first place you should check.  Unlike other hardware stores they have hundreds of selection.  A few weeks back I needed two odd sized nut/bolt combinations to fix my lawn mower.  They had what I needed and I was in an out in about 5 minutes.Good stuff.
5	Finally a big store opened up in the mall by Alma and Queen-creak after Target g. Very friendly staff and huge inventory. Love this place all kinds of stuff and Great selection of firearms and hunting supplies. Prices for firearms are not competitive but selection is good.
4	I wish the cat food pricing was at least as good as Target, I would shop there for it and not have to drive all that was to get to Target.  If they had price match, they would have a frequent customer as I feed feral cats.
5	My husband loves this store. Everything from farm animal supply to plumming accessories.  Staff is very helpful.
