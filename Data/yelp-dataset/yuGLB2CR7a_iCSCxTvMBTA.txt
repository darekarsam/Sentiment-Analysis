5	I recently trained with Amanda from Forget the Gym for eight weeks.  I found her to be professional, knowledgeable and extremely well trained and personable.  Each session was challenging and motivating.  After training with Amanda, I feel stronger, I have more energy and self-discipline.  I am very satisfied with my experience with Forget the Gym and would highly recommend this company to anyone who wants to reach their fitness goals.  The only reason I stopped training was because I had to return to my home in NJ.  I spend 3 to 4 months out of the year in Nevada and plan to continue working with Amanda in the future.
5	Forget the Gym is the best fitness plan out there. Having a trainer come to my home or office was the only way I was gonna get it done! The trainers are physically fit, highly trained, motivational and personable beyond words.
5	These guys are the best! Very professional and dedicated trainers.  Highly recommend!
