5	There's not a flower shop around that compares to The Place for Flowers! Taylor and his gifted staff of designers always know just what to do... Weddings, Bar Mitzvahs, Anniversaries, special events, corporate change-outs, etc... No matter the occasion or need, I'm always thoroughly surprised and excited to see what they come up with!True Floral Art!   :]
5	I am so excited to have found an amazing florist in the area! I called two other shops and never heard back... I finally got a hold of The Place For Flowers last minute and they were able to have my order ready within a couple of days. They made gorgeous centerpieces for my son's baptism- exactly what I asked for even though it was just explained through email. I will be using them over & over again!!!
5	Love it!!! They just helped me out at the last minute!!! Awesome and smells great!!!
