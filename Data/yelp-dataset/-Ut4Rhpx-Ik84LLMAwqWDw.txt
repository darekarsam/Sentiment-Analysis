5	This place is absolutely amazing! The zero gravity chairs, the people working are very nice and take their time on you! I am so glad to find this place and I will for sure be back! The pricing is not bad at all for everything this place does!
5	We went to creativTouch as a walk-in, and were very pleasantly surprised with the whole experience.  The chairs are unbelievably comfortable, the services unsurpassed, the technicians are polite and gentle.  This was a birthday treat for me, and we have decided that the rates and the pedicures are so wonderful that this will become a once a month treat for ourselves!
5	Second visit to creativTouch, and certainly won't be our last.  We're going to treat ourselves once a month to the pedicures, manicures and other services.  Top-notch customer service, soothing pedicures and just an all-around great place to be pampered by people that care how you are feeling.  :)
1	Only good thing I can say about this place is that the nail tech was pleasant...I should've left as soon as I walked in and the place was empty of customers !!  My gel manicure turned out to be a MESS!!!   One nail developed a bubble by the end of day 1. By the end of day 5 I had 4 nails that had chipped.  After 1 week had 6 nails that gel chipped - WTH .. Obviously you get what you pay for - $25 for gel manicure and an extra $5 to first have the old gel polish removed - huh, never been charged extra for that at other places.  Needless to say I will NOT be returning To this place again... My advice is stay away from this place, they obviously are using inferior quality product if the gel didn't even last a week--and I wear gloves to protect my nails when doing housework!!
