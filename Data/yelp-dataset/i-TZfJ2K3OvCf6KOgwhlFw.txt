4	Vie & Nam isn't fast food...Just good Vietnamese food in a hurry!Located in the food court of the Industrielle Building, they serve good Vietnamese food at a fairly responsible price. When I want a "grab and go" lunch because I'm in between meetings, Vie&Nam is on my list of places. For $5 (all taxes included) you can grab a pork or chicken sandwich that they will toast it warm for you. You have the option to have it made spicy or regular - I always take mine spicy!
4	I had the Combo #4....Grilled steak, rice and vegetables.    The beef was nice and tasty...done on a hot grill....delicious.... The rice and vegetables were also very well done....great fast food choice in Ville Marie-Gare Centrale.
4	Very good pho. I've had better, but I was very pleased with theirs. I ordered spicy but I had to add sriracha. Perfectly hit the spot after traipsing in the snow.
3	As a a Vietnamese, I am truly disappointed by the food there. I tried a lot of things on their menu, but still, there wasn't anything close to the real deal. The pho was okay, the sandwich had a plain taste, the spring rolls were really oily, but still crunchy... The list goes on and on. But I guess the quality is okay for a Vietnamese fast food restaurant and it's cheap. I'd recommend it if you want something cheap and a bit asian.
