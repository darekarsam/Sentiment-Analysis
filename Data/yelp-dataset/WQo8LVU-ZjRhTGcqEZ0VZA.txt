4	While the place was a bit expensive I thought the service was great and the food was phenomenal. I will definitely be returning and recommending this hole-in-the-wall to friends anytime they are looking for delicious Korean food.
4	Food quality was more of a three star, but because of service and since it beats out the korean restaurants around the strip, I'll give it another star.I wouldn't come here if you're looking for korean BBQ, it's a bit expensive and little.However, if you're looking for a decent korean home food it's good!The Mae-oon tang (spicy soup? Not sure what it was called in English on the menu, oh and definitely share this one, it's big) and bibimbap in the stone pot is good. They have pork cutlet and you can't really go wrong with it. I actually enjoyed their fried dumplings too.I had the sulung tang (beef bone broth with brisket) which was decent.I wouldn't say it's the best, but being korean visiting the strip, I would go here for a meal
1	One of the worst places I have ever eaten at.  Very high priced.   I ordered what I was told was a noodle dish with vegetables and beef.  I had to search hard for the few tiny grains of beef sprinkled around the edges.   We had a party of 15, and all extremely disappointed with the food.
