1	Awful dry cleaners.If you use them, be sure to count every item going in and every item coming back out. Expect  to be occasionally missing items.You will get items back with stains or smells that they did not have when going in, and if you question any of it, you'll get told it was your fault.Also, if the ticket says "ready by 5" and you show up at 5:30, don't expect your clothes to be there.Stay away!
5	This dry cleaners is able to have you finest garments starched, pressed, and out the door faster then any other place I've used before, the employees are always nice and welcoming, and haven't lost one piece of my clothing yet. Thanks for being a reliable company.
