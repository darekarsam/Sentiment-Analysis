1	A little pricey, and the quality and service was not there to match.Had the filet sandwich was very much overcooked (you could not request how you wanted it cooked), the beef was not at all tender, probably because it was over cooked.The pizza was OK and the salad was great!There wine bar looked interesting but I am not sure I will be back.
2	The location is the best thing about this place. The food is, at best, edible, and will get the job done. One of our two servers botched an entree order, despite repeating it and confirming it to my table. The other server, thankfully, did replace it without hesitation, but became somewhat surly by the time our meal was winding to a closer.Highly recommended for: people watching.
