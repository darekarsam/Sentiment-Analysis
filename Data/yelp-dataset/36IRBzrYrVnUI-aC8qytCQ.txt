5	Kelly's is the one bar in Pittsburgh where I'm just as comfortable as I would be in my living room. Actually, even more so, since I don't have to pour my own drinks! Best neighborhood bar in town.
4	I finally stopped into this blatantly obvious dive bar nestled within Lawrenceville after years of passing by it on my way down to Butler Street. I knew before even walking in that I was going to have a good time. Very Irish. Very Pittsburgh. Very fun. And they serve free popcorn! A friend and I came in, pretty much took over the upper area to play darts for a couple of hours. The drinks are relatively cheap (although I was hoping for cheaper), the bartenders and regulars were very nice. The bar is CASH ONLY, but they do have an ATM in the bar. When the ATM machine didn't hand me out the cash I requested, the owner came right over and said he would call the repairman right away- however, it spit out the money on the second try. I'll definitely stop in again soon.
