3	If you want to eat at an authentic non-chain mexican cafe, Salva Mex won't disappoint. True to its name, newly opened Salva Mex offers both mexican and salvadorian dishes.  We tried the tamales, carnitas, and pupusas and they hit the spot. The food diversity is nice, the taste is better than the chain fast-food restaurants, and the prices are very fair. Salva Mex is a small cafe with basic decor and simple seating.  A great place for a quick bite on the way to/from Red Rock Monument. It's just east of Whole Foods on Charleston.
5	Located on Rainbow/Charleston, this small family owned business is worth the stop to try and enjoy.  Everything is fresh and made to order.   My personal favorite are the cheese Papusas,  the cabbage mixture is very refreshing.   The menu consists of traditional Salvadorian dishes, and some mexican eats (not so much authentic but a really good fusion taste).   This is our go to spot on night we want to lay low, a d it never disappoints!
5	Amazing food, great service. Authentic, hole-in-the-wall, mom and pop establishment. Chicken cheese pupusas were phenomenal. A must for any Mecican-food-cravers visiting Vegas.
