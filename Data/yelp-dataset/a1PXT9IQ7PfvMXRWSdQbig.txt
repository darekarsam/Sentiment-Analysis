5	My wife has been taking all kinds of shoes and boots here to be cleaned for years. She's always been very happy. I recently dropped off a pair of my own boots to be repaired. It was a pair I'd had for over 10 years. My favorites. The leather had completely torn out of the soles, the soles themselves were full of holes, cracked and falling apart, and the heels were worn down to almost nothing. Honestly, I would have had no problem if the folks at Fox Chapel Shoe Service would have said, "Sorry, we can't save these. They're beyond repair." But they inspected them, and said they'd be ready in a week. A week and one day later (who cares if they're a day behind if they're doing quality work, right?) my wife picked them up. When she brought them home, I was shocked. They looked like brand new boots. Re-soled in beautiful leather soles, perfect hard rubber heels, new insoles, and they were cleaned and polished up, too! And, I do believe I smell some kind of waterproofer or other conditioner on them! My wife tells me the man at Fox Chapel Shoe Service apologized for this shoe repair being so expensive. He must be crazy! IT ONLY COST $65! I would have paid him $165! I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone. They're the masters, as far as I'm concerned.
5	Been taking shoes here for years.  It seems as if they are willing to tackle any shoe repair at a fair price. The staff is responsive, friendly and 'customer satisfaction' focused. I refer to them as "The Shoe Doctors".    I highly recommend this service.
5	I took a high end designer purse to be fixed here! It turned out better tan expected! The fixed the strap without any hint of repair! They do a great job on shoes! Great place to do business!
5	I took in a very nice pair of leather boots to have shined and waterproofed. They did an excellent job in a timely fashion during a very busy time of year (the holidays). It was also very well priced! I recommend them for any repair, cleaning, or preserving.
