4	One of my favorite hole-in-the-wall restaurants. It's small and easy to miss, but the food is wonderful and the service is friendly. If you're a fan of Colombian food, this is a must-eat stop in Charlotte. Prices are reasonable, and they also offer takeout and a full bakery. I highly recommend their empanadas and breads (the pan de bono are particularly good!).
4	Great food. Low prices. Try the bunuelos for breakfast. The empanadas are a treat. If you want a (large) taste of Colombian food, try the Bandeja Paisa. Not the healthiest thing to eat, but delicious!
4	Awesome food! Awesome service!
4	Julia S and I were on a top secret mission today for a certain someone's birthday that will remain unmentioned. We stopped in Delicias Colombianas to grap a quick coffee, I simply could not resist the happy, little meat pie empanadas.  What a great little stop, you can grab a quick coffee & pastry or a full blown breakfast of champions. Two coffees and one empanda for $3.50 makes me contenta!
4	Wonderful little place. It was my first day going and I had the Bandeja Paisa. The waitress treated me with arroz con leche for dessert on the house, and the mora juice was to die for. The only dissapointment was the lack of ripe plantains, but I'm counting on coming back here many more times!
5	Love this place, I get the $7 lunch special almost every day. Just call ahead and they will have it ready for you. Staff is friendly and food is great
5	Great food and amazing service.  I had the special of the day and empanadas.  Very authentic!
3	On weekends this place is super delish! Fresh and tasty! I have come in during weekdays and been a bit disappointed.  I do not drive 3 hours to be disappointed! The baked good are wonderful, just get there early or they will sell out.
