5	So cool to see this location used for such a cool cafe, the staff is super warm and nice. It's really a cool place to hang.The brownie are amazing and the smoothies are art.It's easy to see that here people are passionate about what they do.Love Love Love Pagaille.
5	This little corner place is terrific--manages to be hip and homey at the same time. The soups, salads, smoothies are fresh and tasty, and the owners and staff are warm and friendly. Highly recommended.
