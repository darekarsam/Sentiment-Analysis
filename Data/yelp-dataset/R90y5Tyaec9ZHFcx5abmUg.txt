5	As far as fast food goes they do well; never a long wait, employees are friendly, and orders are correct.
3	Quick fuel picked by the supervisor. Ugh. Noticed there aren't any young teenage workers there, which is weird. Maybe they all are working Christmas who knows.  Well the wait on getting our order took forever.  We were kinda the only people in there. So again I have a problem with breakfast being served past breakfast time.  If you say we can still order hamburgers while the breakfast menu is up please put a full menu up of choices. I notice that Burger king does not have much of a good value menu either. After tasting real burgers at other burger joints a do leave a bit unhappy.  But sometimes you have to do what you have to do to survive, This was not my choice of fuel so it is what it is.  The fries were good though.
1	Avoid this BK...bad food, bad service..gotten wrong order last two visits. ..help surly when told of mistakes. .Mgr very defensive...would not provide phone number to voice complaints
5	Manager corrected issues noted in last review. .very satisfied. ..will recommend this BK
