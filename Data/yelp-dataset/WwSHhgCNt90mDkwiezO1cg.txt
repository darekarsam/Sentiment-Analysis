5	In regards to tires, these guys are the digity. I am on my second set from them, not simply because their prices are right on the money, but because of the service. If you bought your tires there, you get them rotated for free. Got a flat or leak? Fixed for free. And their quite nice about it.The waiting room has the typical coffee, TV, magazines, soda machine, and bathroom, but the TV isn't annoyingly loud like some places, the magazines are current, I don't drink soda or coffee so I can't comment on those. The Trader Joes is a 200 foot walk if you want to kill some time. There is no doubt in my mind why they received the 2011 Business Ethics Award from BBB.
2	Wen there with my wifes car for an alignment.  I paid for it and was told it barley needed one so they weren't going to charge me full price. I parked it when I got home and a week later noticed that the back tires were still leaning took it back in and they said it was fine. Went somewhere else and paid 80 bucks and now it looks like and rides like it is supposed to.
5	Have used them for tires and fixing our vehicles.  Great customer service. Best place in Surprise.
4	This is the second oil change I've gotten from this place. Friendly staff and prompt service brought me back. I like that the guys here seem trustworthy and that they aren't trying to sell me a bunch of stuff I don't need. Mike, one of the technicians is super friends and helpful! I'll be back for sure!
5	Very friendly and responsive staff! Took my car in for an oil change and a safety check. Everything checked out and they didn't try to upsell me on things I didn't need. I definitely appreciate the honesty and integrity. I will be retuning to this shop in the future!
