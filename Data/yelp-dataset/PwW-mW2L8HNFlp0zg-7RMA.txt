5	Got a ticket in Arizona.  Used these guys to complete traffic school and it was just as advertised, paid less and it was easy!  I didn't have to do anything once the school was complete.
5	I called them beforehand and asked questions and they were very helpful. The course was inclusive but was fairly straight forward and easy. As advertised. You may pay less for your ticket. Good Luck!!!!!!!!!! Waiting for my official notice of the ticket being dismissed.
5	I recently got my driver's license after taking driving lessons from this school. I had a very good experience with them. I hadn't driven much before but I feel pretty confident now. My instructor always emphasized on the right driving technique to pass the road test. Most importantly I was taught to develop safe driving habits. If you are located in the Phoenix city area, their location is very convenient. Not cheap, but you'll get your money's worth.
