1	If my review for the T-Bell in Forest Hills is used as a reference, I can certainly say that this location is terrible. It is as if they dropped the tortilla in a puddle (probably a toilet... get it?) prior to assembling what is supposed to be a delicious meal. By the time I got the food home it was so mushy, cold, and overall dissatisfying that I would've fed it to the dog, but the dog sniffed it as he walked by and decided to chew on his rawhide instead. HIS RAWHIDE - what kind of world are we living in when a dog isn't even interested in Taco Bell? A sick, sad world indeed.
1	After waiting in line in the drive through for over 20 minutes, I was told that they had ran out of chicken, beef, beans, and rice. This was the night of the 4th of July so you would think they would have expected to be busy. After waiting for so long, I thought they should have at least had someone come out and tell the cars waiting in the drive through, that they had run out of everything besides steak and desserts so that everyone did not waste their time waiting in a very long and slow line. I'm very disappointed by this taco bell.
1	What a dump! Messy messy. Stale food. Sloppy employees. WTF Taco Bell?!?! Someone please clean this place up.
1	Like listen, your job isn't hard. Just follow what i ask for and stop giving me an incorrect order. Im sick of driving through twice to get things fixed here.
5	The employees handled themselves well the other night when a disgruntled employee -  Ashley loudly in a vulgar way left the restaurant in her misguided teenage angst driven meltdown. Kudos to the staff and manager for keeping a level head and providing good food and service during a clearly uncomfortable situation for them. Thanks for the good food and service. We'll be coming back and enjoyed the entertainment Ashley provided. Albeit the employees were uncomfortable but we lead boring lives and this is all the fun we ever have.
