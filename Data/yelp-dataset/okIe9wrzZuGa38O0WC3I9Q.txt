1	Terrible "Sunday Brunch"!  They advertise "bottomless" champagne Mimosa's but they pour mostly oj!  They are super stingy with refills and they ran out of 1 of the only 4 items available to eat. Would not recommend, staff is pleasant enough but brunch stinks!!
3	Ehhh......its ok. The bar seems outdated.  The dollar bills on the wall, is just lame. Beer selection was ok, staff was good. The menu to me just didn't seem inviting, I didn't order any food, after looking at it for 30 min.  Ehhh......better options within walking distance.
5	Tried this neat little spot for lunch. Really nice location and atmosphere. Had the lunch size Sheppard's pie. Have to say it was one of the best I have ever had. It had a pastry  puff baked on top. Service was excellent. Price was a bit on expensive side for lunch. But quality was outstanding. I will be coming back.
1	Murphy's Law Pub in Chandler Az has good food but they have been caught in a number of false advertizing situations as was also mentioned by another reviewer. In my case,  they state on Friday's its Free Brownies... I have gone there during lunchtime on Fridays and have never received a free brownie.When i ask about it i get double talk by waitress stating its only while "supplies last"... a convenient excuse to draw people in while Not honoring their advertizing which is boldly displayed on a large bulletin chalk board outside their pub..Be careful folks... they advertize with forktongue...  its a shame that they need to stoup to that level... i dont like being duped and wont be going back... shame on you Murphy's Law.... you need to be honest with customers not to mention you are also understaffed and the time to receive meals are really excessive... its clear you cut on expenses in a number of ways that cheat customers. Dont fall for the games they play with their false advertizing methods. They also cut corners on senior discounts which is really pathetic...
