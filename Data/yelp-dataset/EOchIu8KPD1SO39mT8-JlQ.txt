3	Mixed experiences I'm afraid.Food is good and was particularly impressed when I ate in, however takeaways take forever to arrive and even when I've collected seem to take far too long (my guess is they forgot my order until I turned up).Recently undergone a facelift so would be interested to see if anything else has changed.
4	I've recently been back to the Delhi Diner and it was really good.The service was attentive without being intrusive, the food was delicious and they have big bottles of Cobra beer! What else could you ask for???Definitely will go back.
