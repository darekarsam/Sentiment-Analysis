3	I tried the western egg white melt on light wheat English muffin for breakfast this morning. It wasn't bad, Subway is close to my office and I like the green bell peppers and onions that they add with it. Okay for $2.60
3	Although its in a run down neighborhood, I found this establishment to be quite nice. I just got a soda, but the staff was very friendly. In fact even the patrons were friendly, one gentleman yielded some seats for us ladies. Also, I noticed that they regularly mopped and cleaned. So both the floors and the tables were immaculate.
3	Subway is always good for a quick lunch...and I go to this location because it's close to my job. Usually things are fine but lately the customer service has not been to great...
