1	I called the West Flamingo location to ask a question about their Groupon policies (I wanted to use two on one day instead of having to use one and then use the second on a separate day). The guy who answered was incredibly rude and refused to answer my question. I asked to speak to his manager. When I finally talked to the manager, she was as rude as the original employee I spoke with. She basically told me to 'screw off'. Then she hung up on me. They were very unprofessional. I would advise potential customers to use a different store to purchase supplements.
5	Friendly, knowledgeable staff that always seem happy to spend the time helping me get what I want, and understand how to take it, and why. If I want something a bit more exotic, they are always ready to find most things for me quickly. As for the first guy, I think his beef is with Groupon's rules, not this great little business. Also, they price match anyone in town. How great is that?
5	A really fun place to shop! Knowledgeable, passionate staff, great selection, competitive prices.
3	"oh this product works and this is one is a good seller......" Ehh, I believe I was being lied to the entire time, trying to sell me the highest priced product on the shelf.  They are way over priced and when I asked for the LVAC discount, which they advertise all over LVAC gym, they told me it was already given to me, which was the price on the sticker.....umm what?  It thought I would REALLY get a discount because I was a member, what a sham!  The man helping me did tell me they price matched but he said he didnt have the number to the other nutrition store and that I would have to find it.  Couldnt believe the terrible customer service I received. I will never go there again.
5	Great staff!
