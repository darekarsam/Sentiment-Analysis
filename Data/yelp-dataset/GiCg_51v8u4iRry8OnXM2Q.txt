4	Nice place. Cool atmosphere and the customer service was really good.
4	I love this store. I feel its like the urban outfitters for skateboarders. Only place I can find clothes Zumies don't have. Clearance rack is never a failure for me. I can count on finding something there that is not a store brand.
4	Love this place. For a fat guy they put all the xxl shirts on one rack in the store. easy shopping for fat guy like me who do want to walk all over the store.
