3	I didn't hang at the White Eagle very long but stopped in here for a drink on an afternoon and there was one person in there. Totally a smokey dive bar with an array of chip bags behind the counter. The bartender was sweet and I got two buds for $5, and to me that is such a bargain. I would come back to the White Eagle except that the smokiness did cling to my clothes long after I left.
4	First year, we went to Jack's. They'll always have a special place in our hearts as the best dive bar ever. This time, we went on a mission to find this year's Jacks...low and behold, The White Eagle. Great drinks cheap prices, and they even made us a special local drink. Definitely left there pleased. Warning - if you're looking for an upscale bar to take your lady friend on an impressive date, be forewarned. This is divey of divey of bars. That's exactly what we went looking for. Very cool people, laid back atmosphere, but very much a dive bar (and considering it's Carson street, dive says it all). We had a great time!
