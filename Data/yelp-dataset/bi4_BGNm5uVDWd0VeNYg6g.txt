3	Not a bad wee printers, i've used their Glasgow branch quiet alot.My only gripe is the minimum qauntities you can order, it's hard really hard when you only want 50 posters made to find somewhere. It's even harder to get served with a request like that. But realistically, most people don't need upwards for 25,000 copies of something.Need to be a bit more welcoming to us commoners i think.
3	I agree massivly with Stuart - theres no way that this place can survive if they make you order 45 million copies of something before you can even get started - especially oif you only need a couple of hundred doing.The shop itself isnt all that bad, and for a printers, its quick and the staff are friendly - right up until the moment they hit you with that bill. Nightmare.
3	It's a printers, it prints and photocopies things for you....not much else to it really!!The price isn't OTT but is a bit eyebrow-raising. I agree with Stuart, the staff could work on their friendliness, but still, they're just there to maintain I suppose!It's a good service to have!
3	Being someone with a passion for quality reprographics, I thought I'd feel like a pig in shit in this haven of photocopying, inkjets and blank paper.Perhaps I'd slightly misjudged the shop's purpose though, as when I asked to take a copy of my birth certificate for the passport office, they looked at me with a mixture of contempt, derision and befuddlement.That put me in my place.
