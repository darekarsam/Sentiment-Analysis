5	They sure do make the most of a small store...er, basement. They owner gave me some freebies and was very helpful. The bi-lingual staff was out smoking and we were left alone digging for some johnny cash, but we compared record stores and curtis mayfield and in general it was very pleasant. The best place to find French and 1960s vinyl. I can see myself spending long hot summer afternoons here.
4	Like the song says, "You can't always get what you want," but the guys at Beatnick sure do try hard, and, who knows, "you just might find you get what you need."  The scope of their collection is impressive, especially if you're into rock, modern rock, soul, sixties, Franco pop and prog, country, and oldies.  Primitive + Beatnick has long been an important record shopping combo for me.Great rotating (sometimes literally) window displays, too.
4	I've ducked into a few stores in Montreal and have often been overwhelmed by the prices (usually double-digits for run-of-the-mill titles).  Beatnick is the first place where I thought some things were actually cheaper than normal!  Maybe it was because of their condition, but I found some great deals.  The selection is decent.  Not huge, but some quality titles and the bilingual staff seemed very helpful.
5	Nick's a cool dude and knows his music. He's also an avid concert goer and music hound. If he can't find it ,no one can.
1	I found an LP I was looking for at a very fair price on their website. After paying $15.00 shipping, it took several weeks to receive since they only put $4.22 postage on it to cover the media mail charge. Plus they shipped it 2 weeks after I paid. So they overcharged me $10 for shipping AND dragged their feet in shipping it. I would avoid using them for any type of mail order. Says a lot about their business ethics, or lack thereof.
4	Nice little spot with a good variety of records. I snagged two Jethro Tull albums from here yesterday for under $10! Friendly and helpful service, I will be back.
