3	I can't figure if this station is filled with gimmicky, icky, schmarmy, markety hoohah or if it's revolutionary. Sometimes, the news shows seem to try so hard to be "different" and "hip" and "young" that it feels really contrived; however, when it works, it really works. The folks on the various local news shows have great chemistry, and it can be fun to observe their interactions. Sometimes, though, their antics become the focus of the program, and not the news or the commentary. I go back and forth. It's kind of like a train wreck, though, in that I can't stop watching. I'll watch the local news programs just so I can debate whether or not it's awful or funny or fun or horrid...and I've been watching it for about a year now, debating. I guess what they are doing is working, though, as I"d never deign to watch local news programming anywhere else. I hope somebody else reviews these guys, as I'd like to hear what you think...
3	I think this station is known more for it's craziness & quirkiness than journalistic ability. It's one of the few stations I can actually name some anchors & other local "celebrities" that host some of the local shows. The Edge is a show hosted by Brotha Fred from 96.1 & the beautiful Morgan Fogarty. It's a news show with a young, humorous flair to it. Other than their crazy weatherman, the normal newscast isn't anything special & I tune in to a couple other stations for the local news.
1	AW-FUL.  Dumb and unfunny.  Those two morning idiots (the blond girl and the chubby guy) say something so asinine every time I flip by it that I am stunned.
1	Requesting the termination of two 'news reporters' for their sexist disrespect for the female Pilot that bombed ISIS. Disgraceful. Your news cast is a joke. You, FOX news are not reliable nor credible .....signing off forever!!!
