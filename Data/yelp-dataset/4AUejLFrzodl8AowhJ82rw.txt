4	Finally a museum cafe that doesn't have pedestrian chicken fingers and fries.After spending nearly two-and-a-half hours in the museum, my friend and I were ready for some food. We decided to see what the cafe had and were impressed. I had the day's quesadilla which had smoked trout, scallions, and horseradish cheese. My tastebuds were thrilled. The field greens salad was also a delight. I am sure I could have easily paid more than $10 for the same meal at any other museum cafe. Worth every penny. And those pennies saved can be used to buy something at the gift located right next to the cafe.
5	Passionfruit + coconut + cupcake = decadent mouth partyThat is exactly what happened when I tried that delicious treat after my tour of the Mattress Factory one afternoon. The passionfruit frosting was one of the most delicious creations my taste buds have ever witnessed. On top of that it was beautifully presented and the cafe is quaint and lovely.
