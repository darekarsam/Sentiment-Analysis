5	This is an amazing place. They have comics, games, action figures  (Star Wars, Walking Dead, McFarlane, etc) Very knowledgeable staff . Family friendly.They host events of all kinds Magic the Gathering, Anime, Art, movies, Pokemon, etc.
1	While the shop is open and clean, there is only a fraction of the latest on the shelves. The guys working were short and not helpful at all. They seemed more interested in their own conversation than engaging customers. When asked about new releases from the previous Wednesday, I was told that either the comic had not come out when other stores had it or that they would not be receiving a shipment because it did not sell and they would recommend that I try out a "good" series. Even getting wrong out was a hassle and I was made to feel more like a bother than a welcomed to customer.The whole place just seems like someone with little comic acknowledge had gotten a hold of old Atomic Comic decorations and decided to try to run a comic shop well only carrying big names like Batman, Wonder Woman, X Men, and Wolverine.
