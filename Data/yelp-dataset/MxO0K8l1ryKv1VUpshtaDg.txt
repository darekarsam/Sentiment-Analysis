4	Anni Loggins at Lighten Up and Face It has a nice little thing going. I found her because of a daily deal site and then forget I had purchased the voucher until I stumbled across it. Anyway, it was for a Organic Wildcrafted Herbal Facial which I really enjoyed. It is pricey ($111) so that is why I rated it 4/5 stars but she knows her stuff and everything is organic so your face should not get red and mad at you for getting a facial. She wipes away all the products she puts on your face with chamomile tea bags which feel and smell awesome. She will get rid of those icky blackheads, too, if you ask. You will walk outa there feeling like you are floating on a cloud with her relaxing shoulder/head/arm/hand massage but be warned...you get a little lotion-y so don't have any big going out plans after ward.
5	GREAT!!! I love her, best facial I have ever had!!
5	I purchased a Groupon for an Organic Sweet Red Rose and Chocolate Facial at Lighten Up and Face It - what a great experience! I was expecting a standard facial and instead of that Anni provided a relaxing, informative and truly pampering experience.  She gave me some great advice for the future on managing my skin care regimen and recommended products (not all her own) that were relatively inexpensive.  It was a refreshing change from salons that normally heavily promote the product lines they use at over-inflated prices.  Not only that but Anni is a very caring and intuitive individual and provides a truly holistic experience.  My skin felt wonderful and I was rejuvenated and energized.  Thank you Anni!  I have no hesitation in recommending her services - don't miss out.
5	Anni has a true gift. I've been going to see her every month for almost a year. The best facial I have ever had, and I've been to many other places. She will not only make your face look and feel great, but she also exfoliates and massages the arms and hands, the neck, shoulders and scalp. I wish I could get the Anni treatment every day!
