4	Great place to get your morning croissants. It's a co-op, run by friendly granola people in the middle of gourmet gulch. The baguettes and bread are ok, but I really love the pasteries: chocolatines, croissants, chocolatines aux amandes, baluchons. For lunch the goats cheese pizza is great. There is also a great goat's cheese panini.
3	I was here to try their croissant and baguette. Turned out their products were not as good as some of the reviews suggested. Sure, their croissant smelled buttery but not flaky enough to my liking. As for the baguette, the crust was fine yet the crumb was far from creamy and moist.
4	The croissants should be illegal, because they are highly addictive. Put this place on your bakery crawl. Every time I've came here on a weekend morning, it's been busy busy busy! I guess other people have heard about their great croissants too. In other news, the coffee is good, the bread is solid, and the other baked goods are great. All in all, a respectable bakery to call your own in a city chalk full of them.
4	Always a good sign to enter a bakery before 8am on a Saturday morning, and there already be a line. There must be something good going on! And there definitely was! Delicious croissants and assorted other viennoiseries.  The baguette rustique was pretty darn good too. And with display cases full of tempting goodies, pastries, cakes, breads, etc, I will definitely be back to find something I can call my favorite, because I'm pretty certain I will find it here.
