5	This rating is based on convenience, price, and quality.  A McGill management student might say an awesome cost-benefit given a university student's low budget.  It's also just an awesome sandwich; very big, toasted French bun, and just delicious.  NO McGill, Concordia, or nearby professional should go without having tried a super sandwich.  Prices range from $2.25 to at most $5.000.  The clear favorite is the egg sandwich($2.75).  Can add a soda and bag of chips for $1.75 extra.
5	This place is a little hidden inside Le Cartier building but worth visiting for any one wanting a quick feed for cheap.It's a convenience store so you have all the basic convenience store goods as well but everyone lines up for the sandwiches. The egg salad as the previous reviewer said is great and the chicken salad is awesome and a whole lot better than most of the crap Subway sell. The bread is fresh and tasty and you'll get it slightly warm when ready.Ever since finding out about this place I've gone every few days and my taste buds and wallet thank me for it.
5	This is my favorite lunch spot go-to when I forget to pack my lunch (which is admittedly quite often!). Who can ask for more? A huge variety of sandwich fillings and all for under $5 (with taxes, chips and soda) plus or minus a dollar.It sounds silly, but it's cheaper to buy your lunch here than to bring something from home! The French bread is warm and tasty, the fillings freshly cut or made. I love their egg salad sandwich and with a chips and a pop, it comes to $4.75! You will always see a line-up, especially when the students come back for school. I hope they stay in business forever!
