4	Short-n-Sweet: Outdoor bar, simple, small, possibly 2 local microbrews offered. Story Time: I'll let my photos do the talking.
3	It's easy... They have good service (very attentive without being pushy), great seats to watch the light show, and good drink prices (with a good poor). I'd stop by again. Note: the frozen drinks are very sweet!
4	This is a pretty cool bar. When we were here they had the baseball and football games on. It is all outdoors and anyone can watch the games so it can get pretty crowded. The bar stools and 4 tables are for paying customers only, but non-customers grab seats pretty easily. Since they are to the side of the bar and its hard for the bartender to see.
