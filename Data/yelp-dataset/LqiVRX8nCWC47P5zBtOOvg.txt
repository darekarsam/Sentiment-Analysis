3	Sister to NoFo and in the same building is Mexi Cafe.  Inexpensive and filling, what it lacks in flavor it makes up for in being quick and well prepared.  Although I don't like their salsa, the chips and guac are fresh.  And the beef tacos on corn shells are tasty and served on a hot plate.  They have several tequilas to choose from for a Margarita and the seating is comfortable enough to hang around for a while and enjoy it.  No outdoor seating while the construction on Elizabeth is occurring but similar to NoFo, parking across the street is easy.  Good for dates, quick lunches or small groups.
3	Decent Cali-Mexi cuisine at reasonable prices. Don't come here expecting large plates, the servings are smallish. We've been a few times because a friend loves their bar-b-que tofu, and both their vegan(ish) burrito (the Green Burrito, if I remember correctly) and the Taco Salad with tofu were satisfying. Not outstanding, but consistent, with decent service.
5	Sad to say that the Mexi Cafe closed.  I loved this concept, too bad the city worked on the street for over a year and the NOFO on Liz had to close.
