5	Strippers and drag queens can't be wrong: This is the best place to get wigs and hair pieces. I've been here several times before as a place to browse the various wigs. So, Sunday, after dim sum, I came here to get a wig for a "talent show" at my family reunion. [My mom and I are reenacting the scene from "Drop Dead Gorgeous" where the nurse is pushing a wheelchair with last year's Mt Rose Sarah Rose American Teen Princess is lip syncing to Melissa Manchester's "Don't Cry Out Loud"--I'll be in the wheelchair] Not only did I find the perfect wig, it was amazingly affordable. For less than $30, I'll be able to make my dreams come true! I was actually able to wear this wig at a pool party that day; it was a big hit.
5	Huge selection of wigs and extensions clothes, jewelry, trinkets etc. keep in mind everything is cheaply made Chinese crap, but everything is decently priced. I bought a elbow length three tone wavy wig for a girls wig night and paid 26 bucks. Obviously synthetic, but I've bought several of the same quality from other shops and paid 5 times as much!!
5	I can always count on them having a wide variety of hair products. All of their  leeks are very knowledgeable about all of their merchandise of they will promptly get someone to assist you. They stay up with the trends and the hip music playing softly in the background picks up your mood. On top of it all, they are open longer hours than their competitors daily.
