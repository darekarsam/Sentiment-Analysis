2	Not my favourite restaurant - I don't frequent fast food chains, but I do like McD's hot chocolate!
1	slowest drive thru known to man. Never fails this place will always have you waiting ! It should be classified Food not Fast Food !
1	Slowest service ever. I dont go very often but definitely not ever going again. I waited 15 mins just to get mcchicken sauce horrible service.
