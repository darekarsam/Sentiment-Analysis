5	Not your ganny's yarn store. A place for those who knit and crochet or want to learn. They have this wool called Loppy Mango out of New York that is TO DIE for. I had not knitted for 5 years and I fell right back in love after a quick lesson from Brenda, the owner.Come here to ignite your creativity and bring a friend!
5	Unwind Knitting is amazing! Brenda, the owner, was very friendly and passionate about her new shop. I'm from out of town - but I can't wait to return the next time I'm in Vegas. She had a great selection of yarns, lots of samples (which helped sell me on two new-to-me yarns) and has a great "vibe" going. It's an excellent shop for new or experienced knitters. You should definitely check it out!
5	Cool place on the 'other' end of the strip.  My pregnant wife was jonesing for some knitting yarn, and this place fit the bill!  The girl working was very friendinly, and it seemed like a hip, convienient place to get the goods.
5	After living in one of the sunniest, hottest, dryest places on the planet (Abu Dhabi), my family and I are moving to cold, gray, rainy England!  What better way to "unwind" and cope with the stress of this transition than to revive my beginning knitting skills, which have lain dormant since I was 19?  What a blessing to find Brenda's shop!  Her yarn collection is inspiring and makes you want to knit yourself an entire wardrobe.  She was totally kind in helping me choose yarn and needles (despite the fact that I wandered in with no pattern and told her I wanted to "wing it" LOL could I have been more vague).  Brenda was also kind and very friendly with my two daughters, ages 7 and 8, despite the fact that they wandered around the store basically getting into everything!  Will definitely go back to browse and hang out!
