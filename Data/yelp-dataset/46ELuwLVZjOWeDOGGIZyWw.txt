5	I have only gotten air brush spray tans here. They are absolutely wonderful. I have never had a problem being orange or spotty. I will never do a spray booth ever. With the airbrush she can direct the tanning solution to the areas that need it and avoid those that absorb more quickly. They are very professional and friendly. The cost is great compared to the health benefits you get for not tanning in the bed. I have recommended them to many friends. I had one that was in a wedding and needed to fill in a farmers tan, you couldn't tell the difference in the tans!
5	This place is family run and a great place to tan.  The reviewer that said the place is creepy is clearly an idiot.  The guys and gals at the front desk are extremely friendly (as long as you're not a creeper trying to run in and out as fast as you can).  I would suggest this place to anyone.  Just a heads up if you like the stand ups, there is only 1, but it gets the job done.  Thanks Alternative Tan!!!
5	Great staff, great beds, great prices and fantastic service! Unfortunately my husband is military and we have had to relocate a few times in the last couple years. Of all of the different places and different states I have tanned this is Definitely my favorite tanning salon by far! I'm Italian and olive complexion and I can not even lay the full time in the turbo beds because they are so great! New bulbs, clean facility and very helpful, friendly and informative staff. Thanks alternative tan! :)
5	Alternative Tan is a gem. It's in a quiet little strip center and it took finding them on Yelp to know they were there. The beds are older, but they are hot. Probably some of the hottest beds I've been in. The staff is incredibly friendly and the owner is refreshing. The packages are available in 3 levels and you pay as you use them. No contracts, no freezing unused account. I'll definitely stick with Alternative Tan.
