5	Top 10 Chick-fil-a locations in Charlotte!
5	This is a model Chick Fil A.  You could power a small neighborhood with the wattage of the smiles among the staff.  Always clean, always fast, always accurate in order fulfillment.  Just a very well run unit.
4	The staff are usually good here, although here are a few bad eggs that like to make out with their boyfriends in the parking lot.  The food is always hot, and always tasty, and the order is never wrong, but not the cheapest because the place has a lot of overhead and stupid billboards to pay for. All in all,  I eat here a lot, and keep going back because it's f'ing Chik-fil-a, and there is crack in the food, but the wait in the drive-thru is just ridiculous... 2.5 mins per car, and there are usually about ten in front of me no matter when I go through.  That's a long time to wait after a fifteen hour day. With a staff of like fifteen at any given time, I don't understand the wait.  It's an excellent location if you go inside, know what you want, and don't mind ten bucks per person for fast food, but the drive-thru trap has to be dealt with before they find an aging corpse in the line.
1	I just don't get it...it's just chicken...maybe I'm missing something but it's just fried and grilled chicken sandwiches for A LOT more money than the other places that sell grilled and fried chicken sandwiches. Guess I just don't get it but was not impressed with the food I got. For $9, I'd rather go to a sit down restaurant! Meh...
2	Menu prices appear to be set in real time based upon what the student cashiers think they can pocket in overcharges; recommend paying with c-card to provide recourse for overbilling.
