2	Ok food, but this Ohioan wasn't impressed. Clean inside, and nice bathrooms though.
3	Local favorite due to location and price.  Highly recommend the Southwest Chicken Salad, zesty and good portion size.  Their (normal) fries are great.
2	Okay breakfast. Staff was nice.A bit slow for a Saturday morning...took them a fee extra minutes for our food. Breakfast menu on part with any fast food joint.
