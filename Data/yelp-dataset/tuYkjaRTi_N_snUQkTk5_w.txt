4	I love starbucks coffee, and when I shop at Carrefour,  its a must stop for my Venti moka chip frappacino! The location is clean, the staff is friendly, however the service seems rushed and pushy,  I rather have a good drink then something made in 30 seconds
3	A very nice tradition of mine in winter is to have a nice doppio short machiatto (double espresso) extra foam around 1:15 -2:30 PM.  In summer it's a coffee frappacino extra espresso shot.  This is right around the time when food digestion sets in after lunch and you feel like taking a nap!  However this Starbucks is getting pretty BONKERS these days!!!!! Usually the line is around 10 - 15 deep.  I've noticed when it's this busy the friendliness of the Starbucks employees is on a minimal scale.  When it's not busy they are much more friendly!  The service however is efficient and not too bad for a long lineup today!  *******People of Starbucks Corporate Canada******* if you are reading, please add a second location in Carrefour Laval!  I'm most certain you could increase revenue with a second place!  I can't tell you how many times I've been in line and see people walk away as they think it's too long (me included)!!  It would be great to have taken the La Swiss location however Nespresso beat you to the punch!
3	I had to make clear of what consisted a 'Black Eye' coffee. The cashier was not at fault, I was just impatient that day.
5	I love the breakfast fontiago sandwich and the Christmas coffees always my favorite place
