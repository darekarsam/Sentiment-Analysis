4	Cobbler's Key is an often forgotten little cobblers/locksmiths on busy South Clerk St.Most people go to Timpsons nowadays, the chain store that has really cornered the market on key cutting and shoe repair- an ever necessary business. The truth is that the quality, as far as new keys are concerned, with professionals at local stores like this, if often far better. At least that is my experience.Cobbler's Key also offer watch battery replacement, patching and stitching of clothes as well as providing a range of leather goods. They also do gardening tool sharpening! Although I can't imagine there is a huge demand for that around here.
4	A small little shop next to the Southern. I went to get a couple of pairs of boots reheeled.  Great friendly service. High quality job.  And it was so cheap that I couldn't believe it!Highly recommended.
5	I recently bought a watch on the internet, and although the watch was perfect I felt that the leather strap was a bit loose, and it was in the last hole. I took it to Cobbler's Key last week, and asked the chap to make an extra hole. He couldn't have been more helpful, and when I asked him how much I owed him, he replied nothing. That is what I call service with a smileI have used this shop previously to have keys cut etc. and the service is always first class, and great value for money.Please support local businesses like this, the service is so much better than the big chains, and much cheaper.
