3	This place is a great little hole in the wall. Yes, it is slightly run down. Yes, the menu is cripplingly small. No, you shouldn't pass it up.We usually are on the look for the best pho. Today after being sick we wanted something cleansing. THe pho was light and not as flavorful as it could be. The menu did not include soft tendon which is one of our favorite pho meats, but there were a lot of things not on the menu. What was on the menu was this amazing Bun Cha which basically is a meat salad with noodles, shrimp, spring rolls, glazed pork, and shredded veg. It sounds like a lot is going on but all of the flavors together are very comforting. I would go back just for the Bun Cha.As for the Pho? I know I can find better in the queen city.
4	This place definitely scared me a little at first.  But, now I can't imagine my life without it.  I had the pork vermicelli and it was awesome!  So tender and flavorful.  The vermicelli was fresh and perfect.  I also ordered the fresh squeezed lemonade and was pleasantly surprised.  It's not the cleanest place but you can buy lottery tickets, so, it's a keeper ;)
3	When I came in the other day, the staff was all singing karaoke, pretty loudly. They then sat me under the speakers and continued to sing Vietnamese pop songs without turning down the volume. It was pretty funny I must say.Anyways my egg rolls (cha gio) were pretty bad. They were small and overly wrapped and fried. My broken rice (com tam) didn't seem that broken and the egg cake that came with it was disappointingly small. The pork chop they gave me was HUGE though. it was like half a pig. swear. Interestingly seasoned too, not the normal sugar lemongrass you get on grilled viet pork. Good though.
