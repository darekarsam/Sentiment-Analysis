5	This place is awesome. So much better than regular delis and sub places like subway and doesn't have a bad smell like subway. Prices are reasonable for what you get and great quality meat as well.  They have both hot and cold subs too. Pickles are amazing here and they have tons of hot sauce choices!!!
5	Excellent Subs!  Nice size dinning area with outside patio area.  My wife loves the Italian sandwich!
1	GROSS HAIR FOUND IN SUB!We eat at firehouse subs several times a year and think it's good but this ruined it for my wife.  She took a bite and pulled out a nasty long hair that was entangled in her sub.  GROSS!  When I picked up the subs tonight there were several girls making the sandwiches...you would think firehouse has rules in place to make sure their hair doesn't end up in your food.  It ruined her dinner and  wasted our money.  Thanks firehouse subs.
5	We ordered Club On A Sub and Turkey Bacon Ranch. Both sandwiches came out warm and packed full of toppings! So yummy! The staff was friendly and the seating area clean.Firehouse has a lot of options of toppings, sauces, and we like how the menu is hit sandwiches!
