5	I absolutely adore the V animal sanctuary.  You should definitely make the trip there, especially if you have children. It is huge with so much open and clean space for the animals.  Don't miss the grand opening! !!!
5	The V Animal's Sanctuary is my favorite place in Las Vegas. I know it is meant to be a sanctuary for the animals, but I feel like it is also my sanctuary as well. You can bring the family down to check out the animals, get a tour and sample some great free food this Saturday, March 28th at the grand opening. I wish this place nothing but the best, not only for the animals, but for the heroes that dedicate their lives to saving them.  Thank you!
5	Although I haven't been to the sanctuary (yet), two workers took time out of their day to speak to my after-school club. My school is clear across the world from V Sanctuary. They brought in a chicken and passed her around, while teaching the children about animals. Thank you for caring not only for animals, but for schools as well!
5	If you want to do some volunteer work, consider VAS! Everyone is absolutely wonderful and you'll fall in love with all of the animal residents! The first time you volunteer, they'll give you a tour of the sanctuary and let you know how each animal ended up with them. They are truly awesome for what they do.
