5	Brian is super awesome. Great customer service!  Ask about their rewards program,  boom!
4	Helpful staff. Probably the cleanest shop I've seen. Hours are very hit or miss lately. Not sure if 2-7pm is still their hours. Stock is usually pretty sparse. They do have great deals though. Got some great stuff with their 10 for 25$ and 5 for 25$ deals.
