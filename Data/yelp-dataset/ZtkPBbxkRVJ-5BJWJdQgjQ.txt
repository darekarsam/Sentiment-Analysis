5	I was tired of buying remote control cars from Costco only for them to break a month later with no option but to return them.  So I though I need to find an RC car place near my home that can fix what breaks on the RC car I buy.  Google found me this place and I have been going here for a year now.  I bought my son a remote control truck for $180 (their bottom of the line RC truck), and they sell all parts for this RC so when things have broken over the past year when I bought this for my son, it still works.  That's right it has been year and we haven't thrown this thing away yet.  The service is good here and they just expanded so I must not be the only one going here.  Sometimes if some geek shows up before you there is a wait till they can help you since it is a 1 person run store.  They sell RC plane, helicopters, cars, trucks and they are available in both electric and gas.  Check it out if you are sick of crap breaking like I was.
1	Horrible customer service! I went in there and there was only one person working and he was talking to another customer. The employee did not acknowledge me at all while I walked around for five minutes and then I left. While walking out the door, the employee said have a nice day. The sad thing is I am a customer looking for R/C car parts and batteries. I guess I won't be purchasing anything from this store.
