5	This coffee box isn't the one I frequent most often, but I have been there more times than I can count on both my hands. So, not often is relative to how much coffee I drink. Which is a lot. Which means that 'not often' is actually quite often. All the coffee boxes pretty much provide all the same services, but each comes with its own little worker, and somehow, the man who owns all the coffee boxes is very good at hiring really charming people with excellent taste in music and impeccable coffee-making skills. And there are homemade muffins to boot! My favourite muffin + coffee experience was from one of the coffee boxes. I'd skipped breakfast to run to class, so when I escaped for caffeine I got myself a chocolate & chili muffin, which was mouth-wateringly good. And the 'mouth-watering' in that is not because of the chili, but because of the good. Even though this box here is competing with two Starbucks and a Peter's Yard, it still has its faithful clientele.

No matter what the time, day or weather the people who work here are smiley and friendly. Great coffee and despite the size of the place they have all the ingredients to make as many different kinds of coffee as the Starbucks it is sandwiched between and for half the price. My advice is stick to the coffee though, I once had one of the homemade muffins on offer and they were dry and didn't taste of much. It's shame but other than that this place is great and all power to it for sticking around despite all the surrounding competition.
