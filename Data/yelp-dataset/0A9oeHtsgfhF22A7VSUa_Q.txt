2	We visited the Home Show in Phoenix and decided to have Designer Cabinet Refinishing come out and give us an estimate.  We are wanting to have our oak kitchen cabinets refinished.  Also, we were given a "25% OFF Show Special" coupon.  What a gimmick.  Out of 5 estimates, this company was the HIGHEST with the discount.  Bait and switch, sorry, but you lost my business because of that!
5	Ron was great! Not only was his bid competitive with other two we received (I'm not sure what that other reviewer was complaining about), but he was also able to get our job done quickly (he moved his schedule around to do this), as time was of the essence so we could put our unit on the rental market. The cabinets look great and we got some really wonderful tenants fast! Stoked!
5	We had the cabinets in our kitchen, laundry room, and four bathrooms done by Designer Cabinet Refinishing in 2008 and I'm as pleased with the end result today as I was when they were first done.   As original owners of a home built in 1997, our light cabinets were looking dated but were still in great shape.  A friend recommended DCR, and after seeing what a difference it made in her kitchen, we went for it.  As I said - six years later, they still look great.  We interviewed a couple different companies before making our decision - one of the important factors that swayed us was the 10 year warranty offered by DCR.  I'm happy to say they stand behind it 100% - cheerfully and completely.   It's inevitable that even with the toughest finish, an occasional scratch or chip is going to happen, especially in a kitchen, but their skilled guys - artists, really, the way they create the various finishes -  are able to touch it up/blend it in seamlessly, even six years later.   I just had them out today and my house looks brand new again, like they were just done.  I'd recommend this company to anyone looking for an economical and easy way to update their house - they're terrific!
