5	With over 18 years experience in the industry, Rick is the natural choice for any tint job.  He is friendly and approachable and his prices are very competitive.  I recommend Cactus Window Tint for anyone looking for reliable & professional tint services.
4	Excellent job all around having our home windows tinted. Started with windows in dining room/family area---liked it so much added tinting to kitchen windows. RIck was fair and very courteous---we enjoyed doing business with him. He was clear on what the tint would do and what it wouldn't do---which was important to know. I'm not sure all vendors would give people this straight information.  I would definitely recommend Cactus Window Tint.
4	So anyone who knows me also knows that when it comes to my cars, i'm both very particular and pretty demanding.  I generally don't worry too much about price as long as it makes sense and the quality of the work or product is justified.I recently bought a 2013 BMW 3-Series and as much as I love it, it pained me to drive it without tint (you know, the fishbowl effect and I hate being the fish) so I asked a trusted friend for a referral and was sent to Cactus.Rick knows his tint, has the grasp of customer service that all small business owners SHOULD but often don't and went out of his way to make sure I got what I NEEDED and wanted rather than up-selling me on a more expensive product.  This was about the most painless business transaction I've had in recent memory.  I was absolutely taken care of and charged what I feel was a fair price for the work.  My tint was applied perfectly with no bubbles or wrinkles, in a VERY short amount of time and most importantly to me, my car wasn't a mess afterwards (which has happened several times in the past when dealing with other companies)If it wasn't for the fact that I RARELY give 5 stars, I would certainly do so here but I would have no problem wholeheartedly recommending Cactus tint to anyone in need.  Bring your baby in to see Rick and be secure in the knowledge that he will take care of both you and it.
5	Rick did a great job tinting my Lexus GS with 3m crystalline film. His pricing is very competitive and for 7 windows, he was done in about 3-4 hours. He even dropped me off at my office down the street. Great guy to work with, especially if you want 3M crystalline.
4	The one thing I needed to make my new 2013 Mercedes C250 coupe pop was window tint.  The problem is, everyone seems to either try to rip you off or treat you as if you don't know anything when you're a woman.  I was told that Rick and his team at Cactus Tint would treat me and my car right so i dropped in to see what we could do.  the shop is clean, comfortable and tastefully (if sparsely) decorated and the staff friendly and informative.  Rick and I discussed my options and the advantages/disadvantages of the various products available.  It seems that many in the automotive field tend to treat women as if we don't know anything but felt I was treated with respect and given the information I needed to make the best choice for my particular application.  Rick assisted me in choosing a shade I was happy with as well as a price that I feel was fair. I would definitely recommend Cactus Tint to any friends in need.  (my next purchase will be the Clear Bra so that rock chips don't bruise my car!)
4	Rick was fast, friendly, and gave my car a great tinting job.  All the tints, options and specifications were mind boggling so I just nodded my head when he was explaining things so I hope I got the best tint at the best value I could have.  Anyway, when it was all said and done my car looks great inside and out.  I would return.
4	Updated: I'm a repeat customer of Cactus Tinting for my 2013 Volkswagen. The shop owner 'Rick' does in fact go out of his way with good customer service. During my recent visit there were a couple of missteps in communications but the owner made it right by discounting the bill. They carry the top-of-the-line materials and they don't try to top-down sell anything. Even so, I opted for the premium quality 3M 'Crystalline' tint and the 'SunTek' protective films. This is pricy stuff but I think it's worth it, especially in our Arizona heat.The SunTek matte clear material installed on my car roof seems to be defective with three apparent roller marks (stripes) in a relatively narrow section of the film itself, and not from the way it was applied. This is the same material typically referred to as 'invisible bra'. Hopefully, it will blend together after some time in the sun.'Cactus Tinting' is conveniently located on Raintree Rd. in Scottsdale and the facility is nicely appointed with a clean workshop. In particular I like Rick's work ethic so I wouldn't hesitate to recommend his business to any of my friends.
5	Rick was very thorough and friendly when explaining the options. He was very patient, personable, and respectful which I was quite grateful for since I came in for lower budget tinting on a compact. Service was quick and very professional, and the tinting is awesome. Just a nice and efficient team
5	We just had our 2013 Sequoia colour and heat tinted at Cactus Tint.  Rick was an absolute pleasure to do business with. He advised us on the best options to choose and then completed the job perfectly. No mess, no bubbles, just perfect tint!  He is extremely trustworthy and reliable and did an excellent job. We will definitely be utilizing Rick again for additional car products and tinting of our house windows. Thank you Rick!
5	I'm a return customer to Cactus, quality is always top notch. The folks there are very friendly and the prices are good.
5	I wanted the best tint available for heat rejection and needed to special ordered the Prestige Spectra PhotoSync tint  (http://www.prestige-films.com/) for my Tesla Model S. Cactus Window Tint was the designated dealer in Arizona. I drove up from Tucson to have the tinting installed on my side windows and back. I chose the 65% tint which is not very dark (for visibility), but has the best heat rejection qualities as it increases IR rejection and gets darker with heat. Rick, the owner, was there every step of the way: from ordering the material to the installation.I'm extremely happy with the installation and the film and will go back to have my windshield tinted with 75% PhotoSync film.
5	I went to cactus tint to get the paint protection clear bra on my new Prius...Rick emailed me back on July 4th and got me an appointment on a Saturday. He gave me a great deal. The other guys in the shop are great, explained the paint protection film and tint options for my car. I'm definitely going back to get my windshield tinted.  Just the fact that Rick responded to my emails on July fourth he was going to get my business. Thanks guys.
5	Great service, competitive price, and quality tinting. What more could you ask for?Rick took good care of me, was honest in his pricing, and did a good job. The car was finished right on time as promised. Rick even let me borrow his car since I live very close by! Talk about service!Highly recommended.
5	I came to cactus tint, after a high recommendation from a friend, and I'm extremely impressed with the professionalism, knowledge about the products they offer, and cleanliness of this shop. I met Rick and had many tint related questions and he guided me to choose the tint that was perfect for me! I cannot say how pleased I am with this shop and will recommend it to friends. Every shop in the valley offers 3M tint and wonderful products, but not all shops apply tint as meticulously as this shop and not all shops are spotless in the back and treat ur car as their own. Very satisfied!
5	The guys at Cactus Tint were awesome... Very helpful, professional, and timely. I will be a return customer for sure.
5	Let me start by saying that I am extremely picky about my car.   Rick and his team did a phenomenal job.   I did a matte wrap and tinted my windows.  Rick listened to everything I said and helped me make the best decisions.Can't say how please I am with the results.  Recommend Cactus Tint 100%.
5	Great job with my window tint and Suntek clear bra on my new 2014 Corvette Stingray.
5	If you're looking for Prestige Spectra PhotoSync tint in Arizona and have done your homework, you'll know you can currently (Jan 2014) only get it here. Rick, the owner, set up my appointment with ease and handled some initial questions I had. When I came to pick up my car (which was finished ahead of schedule), I got to check out the work area during a quick inspection of the final product. The guys here run a tidy shop. It's located in the same complex and area as some high-end aftermarket and tuning shops so you can rest assured that they will give your car the same care and treatment as they do the performance and luxury cars that abound. I had to drive up from Tucson to get this special tint but even if I was getting standard tint that's available in any shop, I'd still make the drive here because of the service quality and friendliness I received here.
5	Rick absolutely knows how to run a business. He is upfront, honest, and knows what he is talking about. I had no experience with tinting at all, and he ran through all of the options and pros/cons of each. He gave me a quote and timing and I came back the next day and he delivered on his promise. And the tinting looks sick!On top of all of it, he's a happy dude and its very contagious. I highly recommend Cactus Window Tint.
5	I just recently had my car in at Cactus Window Tint. I went there for window tinting and clear bar. I am beyond impressed and happy with the quality of work. I dealt with Rick from the beginning and have no complaints at all. He was knowledgeable about the products, and he was up front about his pricing, procedures, and time it would take to complete the job. I'm especially happy with the clear bra as it is invisible on the car. I have no problem in recommending Rick and his crew at Cactus Window Tint. Why go anywhere else?
5	Called in and Chris fit me in, a few hours later I was back on the road satisfied with a quality job. Excellent service and attention to detail.
5	GO HERE!!!  After researching lots of places online to get my car windows tinted.. I decided to go to Cactus Tint because of all the good reviews.  I'm really glad I went here.. Rick was really cool and gave a tutorial of all my choices which were displayed nicely for you to see.  He even let me use his company vehicle so I didn't have to wait around for my car to get done.. so I bounced and went and saw a movie lol.  That was a plus.  Rick took me in the back of his shop where he was working on 2 Lambo Diablos and a McLaren F1.  His shop was clean and I knew my 2014 WRX would be in good hands.  I went with Suntek Cxp 18% visor strip and front windows and 5% limo on the rest.  This is one of the best purchases I've ever made.  I cant say enough how happy I am with the % I chose.  I was thinking 18 all around but 5 is the sh*t.  The tint improved the look of my car tremendously and is  exactly the look I was wanting.  LOVE the 5.  My daily driving experience just went thru the roof.  I LOVE IT!!!! DRIVING IS SOO MUCH BETTER NOW!  You have to pay a little more attention at night but it could be worse driving an 18 wheeler or a van that only has front windows to see out of.  Its really not bad at all.  The quality of work Rick did is excellent.  The cut lines are even better than the tint that was originally on my car that the dealer did!!  Rick has a million options to choose from ranging from 1000 bucks to 200.  You will find what you need here guaranteed and will not be disappointed.  THANKS RICK!!!!
5	Cactus Window Tint will be the only place from now on that will take care of our family's vehicles' tinting needs.  Rick, the owner, is unfailingly knowledgeable, professional, and a pleasure to work with.  He performed a Herculean task on my son's older model Accord removing the old tint, then proceeded to make it look great even with the entry level tint that we chose (older model kids' car, getting him through college, no need to go for the high end).  Potential customers - don't be concerned or intimidated with the images of the high-end cars seen here, Rick works with all vehicles, and treats you with the same high amount of care and concern whether you show up in a new Porsche or a teenager's Honda.  If you're not in Scottsdale, going to Cactus is worth the drive; highly recommended.
4	Had an appointment at 9 am this morning to get my windows tinted on my 2010 Civic Coupe. I kind of had done some outside research and knew what tint I wanted, but the owner, Rick, let me know all of my options. I was kind of thinking about going for the mroe expensive option, but I went with my initial decision and got the SunTec I had originally decided on. They have very clear displays of all the tint options for people that have no clue about window tint. (such as myself) And Rick was very helpful in helping me choose my tint. I didn't feel like he was trying to upsell me or anything. They had apple TV and free wifi with a big screen and some couches so I just stayed there for the two hours to watch some Netflix. When my car was done I was charged a bit more than I was quoted, but Rick refunded me the money because he had quoted me an old price by accident. I was a little miffed at first, but I got my money back so all was good with the world!I went home and as I was driving I noticed some scratches in the tint. Unfortunately for me I live all the way in Tempe so I called them when I got home and they said to come back and have it fixed. I drove back up there and they fixed the tint on my windows. It turns out that one of the scratches on my passenger side  was a scratch on the actual window, but the ones on my drivers side needed to be redone. I wasn't too annoyed because it got fixed, but it just sucked that I was there from 9:00am-2:00pm and I had to drive back and forth from Tempe. The owner was very nice and apologetic and offered to buy me lunch, but I felt weird taking his money. In the end my car's tint job looks good and every snag hit along the way was met with a "no problem we'll fix it" by the company. They seemed really busy so that could have factored into why I had some problems. I am just knocking off a star for the inconvenience of having to go back and forth an wait forever on my day off as I had other errands to run, but I would recommend this place to anyone else. My car looks good and if I have any problems with my tint I know that I can bring it in and they will be abel to work with me.
5	Best place to go ever for window tinting and wraps. They have tinted the windows on my truck and did a fantastic job. They also wrapped an offroad race UTV that I race and did an awesome job. Rick always pulls through no matter what. He will not try to nickel and dime you. If he thinks it would be cheaper to do something else, then he will tel you. Honest trust worthy business to go to. Wouldn't go anywhere else.
5	When looking for a window tinting service for our silver Jeep Wrangler, I decided to go here due to the numerous great reviews for Rick and his team.My wife and I had a very positive experience here.  As many others have indicated, Rick is a great person to do business with.  I have no doubt that he would be a great friend as well.  He's professional, competent, friendly, and you can believe in him.  He also is a true patriot, believes in supporting our troops and the "old' American way: good service, quality work, and honesty. The recommended tinting products and the job performed were great.Our billet silver Wrangler looks dark and mysterious now!  We love it.Thanks, Rick, for great service, a great experience, and helping to honor our son, a fallen hero.
5	I meant to write a review sooner, but got busy with work. I got the best service here. I was kind of blown away.My bf got my windows tinted here for me but got them tinted too light. I called back and they were more than willing to help me re-tint the windows on my Prius (even the tiny triangular ones) and even offered me a discount on the re-tint even though my bf chose the lighter shade himself. When I arrived Chris talked me through my options and he tinted all of my windows a darker shade. He even lent me his car while I waited for the tinting to be done (~4hours). On top of it all, we talked about how I was tired of the political bumper stickers from 2008 & 2012 that I still had on my car and how I couldn't get them off myself. When I came back for my car he had taken them off for me. How sweet of him! Of course I tipped him.These guys are super polite and they know about tinting. They do a great job and go above and beyond to give you great customer service.
5	I just got my windows tinted by Cactus Tint with SunTek Hp 35/15 and could not be happier with the service Rick and his crew provided. When I first stopped in Rick showed me all the tint options available and the pros and cons of each. I went with the least expensive option which is a metallic tint that Rick warned could interfere with AM radio, I have found this not to be the case and get no interference with any electronics. When I brought my car in for my appointment they had my tint selection saved on there computer and got my car done 30 minutes after their quoted time. The reason they went over was because they had to redo the rear windshield because the installer didn't think it was up to par. Much better to have it taken care of the first time then waiting to see if id notice it!! Waiting was not a big deal as they have comfy couches and a nice TV selection. I know that in the future if I ever have problems Rick will handle them and he will definitely be my go to tint guy for any future needs. Highly recommended!!!!
5	Absolutely the best experience! Rick knows his stuff. I own a Tesla Model S and they treated it perfectly. I've also spoken with many other Tesla owners who have been thrilled with Cactus Tint's service and quality. I highly recommend them. Also, they will recommend what's best for your needs and not try and upsell you.
5	Thank you fellow yelpers. After reading all the positive reviews for Cactus Window Tint I contacted them via email to ask some questions. Rick responded quickly and gave me options along with his prices for each recommendation.  Like most people, I don't know a thing about window tint but with Rick's help I was able to do some research.  From what I read, his recommendations were spot-on.  He wasn't pushing the more expensive films, he just wanted me to know what they had and how much it would cost.In the past month I've brought both of my cars here. The first was a Mazda SUV that was tinted by the dealer but I was getting a lot of heat through the side windows and the windshield.  I went with the 3M Crystalline on the windshield and the front door windows and the heat was reduced significantly.  The price was reasonable and the work was done within a few hours.I recently took delivery of a BMW and brought it in for "the works". By that I mean that I had all of the windows tinted except the windshield with Spectra PhotoSync. I also had SunTek Paint Protection Film installed on the full hood, full front fenders, front bumper, headlights the rear view mirrors and, from Rick's suggestion, the top of the rear bumper so it didn't get nicked taking things in and out of the trunk.  "The works" wasn't cheap but I plan on keeping this car for 4 or 5 years. I didn't do the film on my previous car and about once a year I'd have the chips repaired on the bumper and hood; over the years I think I've spent the same on repairing that car and it never looked the same.  Money well spent.
5	Tint is essential in arizona. I've been burnt in the past but not at Cactus Window Tint.  Amazing job!!   Call and ask for Rick.  Great service, really knows his tint!!  WOW!
5	Wow- this place is the real deal! Using my trusty Yelp search, I looked for the highest rated tint shop in Maricopa County. Cactus Tint was far and away the highest rated, by many trusted people. I emailed Rick (the owner) a week ago on a Sunday, and within an hour I received a reply, answering one of my numerous questions. I don't expect to hear back on a weekend, but it was a very nice touch.I just bought a brand new car, and I wanted to protect it and have it looking sharp. I learned about a product called "Clear Bra" which sadly has nothing to do with underwear. This product is applied over your front bumpers, fenders, and partial hood. Basically this clear modern product replaces the old creepy leather bras- designed to protect your sled from rocks and the evil chips that hit your car and destroy your paint. Because I bought a dark blue truck, I was concerned that the rocks and crap that fly through the air on the freeway would have my new car looking bad in a week. Of course things are always going to happen- but you can still do what you can to protect your huge investment. Here's a short video showing you what this product can do.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJaTGoDIQtU&feature=plcpI took my truck in to get tinted and have the Clear Bra installed. I met with Rick to go over what I thought I wanted. Rick did an awesome job of translating what I was asking for, to what I really wanted. Rick showed me the different products and spent a lot of time making sure that what I was asking for would meet my needs. Unlike other places, Rick didn't try any upsell crap- he was great! Rick also helped me stretch my dollar farther, and I was able to tint my glass sunroof.When I went back to pick up my truck, it was immaculate. Matt and crew did an amazing job installing the tint and Clear Bra, you can't see it, except for a certain angle. The glass looked amazing with the addition of the SunTek tint material. It's amazing that you can be driving and you don't feel the heat of the sun from the glass. It's like I am driving in a nice safe cocoon, free of sun, paint chipping, and harmful UV rays.If you need your home or auto tinted, don't go anywhere but Cactus Tint. Rick and his team are amazing and provide amazing customer service. Keep in mind Cactus Tint does multi-million dollar cars, and they use as much TLC in tinting a Toyota truck. That says it all to me. There are times when  you don't want to go cheap on something. Body armor, parachutes, attorneys, and Car Tint. If you buy a new car, I HIGHLY recommend that you check out the Clear Bra, it will protect your investment and have your car looking good, years down the line. Rick and his team are consummate professionals and take a great deal of pride in doing precise work. You can tell as soon as you walk in, they are professionals and crisp. The shop is immaculate both front and back of house. If you get to go back into the working area of the business, you will see a work space cleaner than any restaurant, and as clean as a surgical operating suite.I will never go anywhere else for tint or paint protection services. Cactus Tint was tremendous in every way. Thanks guys!
5	My partner and I have been wanting to get our vehicles tinted for a year BUT did not know the best place to go. I asked the AC guy who fixed our AC if he knew of a good place to have our cars tinted. He recommended Cactus Window Tint. He had gotten his daughter's car tinted and was VERY pleased! My partner took her car first as my car is a newer model and we wanted to see how good this place was before I got my convertible car tinted. WOW; after her car was tinted we took it to Vegas for the weekend and what a difference it made blocking out the sun & making the car cooler!I took my car in to have them look it over & suggest what would be the best tinting for my car. Rick, the owner, was AWESOME! He went over every detail of the types of tinting, prices & I told him what I wanted in the types of tinting. He was VERY knowledgeable! I asked him what he thought was best for my vehicle and he told me & explained why in detail. He has 2 VERY PLEASED customers and if you are looking to get your vehicle tinted; this is the place!!!
5	Tinted my Lexus IS250 here a few months ago. Only was able to enjoy the new tint for about 6 weeks before my car was rear-ended and totaled. But the tint quality and darkness was perfect. In addition, they were great to work with when it came to any questions I had. The prices were very competition and they don't sacrifice quality products to get lower prices. Highly suggested. Will be going here again once I need to get a vehicle tinted.
5	Best place in town for tinting & paint protection film (PPF) application!  I just picked up my Porsche Turbo after PPF was applied to the entire hood, front bumper and mirrors and I can't tell there is any urethane coating on the paint because it is so expertly applied and such high quality and transparent!  Rick Sullivan is always great to work with!  This is our third family vehicle we have had the pleasure of Cactus Window Tint making cooler and easier for us to maintain!
5	**HIGHLY RECOMMEND**Wow, they did not disappoint! Customer service was outstanding and I love my new tint. I have been many places for window tint before but never had this experience. Rick answered all my questions via e-mail, which was great. I met Chris when I dropped my car off and he helped me make the final decision. Outstanding customer service and extremely professional. Thanks guys!
5	**Professional, honest, and great work!**I recently moved into the area and quickly realized I needed to tint my Lexus IS250. I have never had any previous vehicles tinted and would consider myself a "noob" when it came to product selection and installation. Cactus Tint is the top rated & reviewed Auto/Home/Commercial business tinting company for a reason, Rick and his team of professionals are amazing. Rick took the time to explain and show me all of my options, he listened to my budget concerns and questions, and we agreed upon a tint and price point. If you love your car and expect professional installation with a satisfaction guarantee, then look no further! Rick is genuine and even provided me with a ride back to my house while I waited for the work to be completed. These guys are awesome and my Lexus looks better than ever, thank you Rick, Chris, and the rest of the team at Cactus Tint!
5	I have always been very careful whenever a relatively large amount of money needs to be spent.  In the beginning of August, I decided that I wanted to have the windows of my new Mercedes SLK 350 tinted.  My first task was to research various window tint film manufacturers, including 3M, Llumar, and SunTek. After speaking with several customer relations people at these manufacturers, I decided to go with 3M's Crystalline series because of it's superior UV protective and heat-reducing properties.  Following that, I needed to find the best vendor to apply the film to my car.  No matter how good the tint product may be, if it's not applied correctly, it can't be effective and hold up over time.  I found seven 3M dealers in my area, and I called each one of them.  The reviews on Yelp about each of these vendors was extremely helpful in my search for "the best" window tinting vendor.  Based on the reviews of Cactus, I decided to go to Cactus Window Tint's store.  When I arrived, Rick was there and spent a lot of time with me going through the different alternatives.  He was extremely patient, and he answered all of my questions.  He also invited me to visit the back of his store where the tinting work is done.  The work area was spotless.  Because of the many reviews I read on Yelp about Cactus Window Tint, as well as all the incredibly wonderful things I had read about Rick, I made an appointment and the work was performed the third week of August.  When I picked up the car, I was extremely happy with the quality of their work. As I drove the car home, I marveled over how much heat the tinting was able to block.Unfortunately, a few days later, I accidentally scratched the film on the driver's side window.  I called Rick, and he told me the bring my car in that afternoon, and when I arrived, he asked me if I could wait about an hour in their very nice waiting area (with free wireless Internet connection).  He replaced the damaged film, and he didn't even want to charge me for it.  Because of my extremely satisfaction with his services, I insisted on paying him despite his protests.  What more can anyone ask:  an excellent product, excellent application service, caring people, and a very competitive price.  Rick is a great person who has a lot of feeling and concern for his customers.  Because of him, and the quality of the work his professional technicians do, I will never go anywhere else in the future for window tinting!  In fact, I'm now considering using Cactus for window tinting several windows of my home.
5	Absolutely recommend this place!  Was able to reach out via email and discuss the details of what I was looking for (window tint on driver and passenger windows of SUV).  Had an appointment booked within a week.  Based on their selection of product, they can keep things simple for you, or take it pretty high end. Showed up for a 9:30am appointment a little early and was OUT THE DOOR before 10am. Very happy with their work!  This crew is quick, professional, and very reasonably priced.  Their shop is SUPER clean with a nice waiting area.  It isn't even worth trying to collect quotes and negotiate with other places, just save yourself the time, and go to Cactus Tint.
5	Chris from Cactus Window Tint was great. He helped me on the phone when I called to inquire for window tinting for my vehicle, and assisted me even further when I got into the shop. He explained and demonstrated the options of tint that I could have and from there I was able to decide. It took them less than an hour to get it done, and I was on my way. Service and work is top notch at Cactus Window Tint.
5	The guys did a great job on both of our Corvettes. The friendliness and professionalism is outstanding! The workmanship was the best I have ever seen and I am a Nit Picker when it comes to my Corvettes! If you want a great job of window tinting, car wrapping, or clear bra installation then these are the guys I would recommend!
5	I had the pleasure of dealing with Rick the owner of Cactus Tint several months ago when he and his amazing staff wrapped my C7 stingray with PPF. From my initial contact with Rick I knew I was in great hands. He and his staff are true professionals and their work is second to none. He always kept me well informed and answered all of my questions in a timely manner. My vette looks phenomenal and my friends comment how amazing a job they did wrapping her. I recently scraped the back passenger panel backing into a parking spot against a metal pillar that was in my blind spot-no excuse-I almost crapped myself. Well I realized it was an area where the PPF was on. I poured hot water on it and wiped with a microfiber towel and watched the PPF self heal as advertised avoided thousands of dollars in paint damage!!! Thanks to Rick and staff for an amazing overall experience. I will be bringing all future vehicles to him for tint and PPF.
5	I decided to use this place of business, based on many positive reviews from Yelp, and I have to I am very happy to have done so.Initially I reached out to the email on their website and immediately received a response, no doubt, from the owner Rick.  We emailed back and forth - talked prices, choices, budget, and a time to come in.I came in and Rick was as friendly in person as he was in his emails!  No pressure or high sales tactics.  Rick gives you the advantages and disadvantages of each product and takes the time to spend it with you explaining everything.  Even while he's meeting with you, he ignores his phone and anything else, dedicating the time especially to you.  He'll even tell you to go home and think about it if you like.Once you commit to a product, you have the option of waiting in the waiting room which has comfy sofas, water, a TV, bathroom facilities, and coffee and even free wi-fi.  It's been many weeks since my product was applied and I couldn't be more happier and pleased with the extremely courteous and professional service and pricing.  Even after the application, I had questions and Rick answered them promptly via email which was the method I chose for communication.Definitely will be sending many others his way and even the wife!
5	Talk about knowledgeable! Rick and his crew know their stuff. Showed me the options, gave me recommendations, and gave me a reasonable price to top it off.I love the tint and the work completed!
5	The best tint shop in town!
