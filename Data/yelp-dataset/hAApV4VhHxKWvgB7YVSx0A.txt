4	This is my GP practice for over 8 years now. It is very conveniently located just of Elm Row in Stockbridge.The building itself is in need of upgrading but it is not that bad as it is a recent enough build. Accessible for wheelchair users. The Medical Center is occupied by 2 GP practices. mine is Dr Tolley's one. The GPs in this practice tend to stay a long time (2+ years or so). I feel really taken care of and listened to. The doctors I have consulted really take time to hear me out and find out what is wrong. They also have medical assistants and practice nurses, whom are efficient and very friendly (bar 1 or 2 occasions).As I have a chronic condition I require repeat prescriptions. Which they let me order by email. Opening times are until 6pm which makes it good for when you finish work and still need to visit them - saves taking time of work! Good job Dr Tolley!
4	There are two separate practices within the same building. So don't get confused between the two! I'm registered with Dr Tolley who are on the left hand side when you're facing the waiting room door.The reception, doctors and nurses have always been great and I've never had too much trouble getting an appointment.   You can request to see the same doctor but I'm usually happy to see whichever doctor is available as I've only been in for fairly minor issues.  All the doctors have been friendly and have been good about listening to what I've had to say. The nurses are always relaxed and kind and good at making sure I'm comfortable.  No complaints at all.
