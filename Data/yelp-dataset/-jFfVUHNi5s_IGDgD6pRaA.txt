5	Green Yoga Spa is Urbana's most inclusive spa and healing center.  It's location in the heart of downtown Urbana makes it an ideal oasis for someone looking for soothing and healing body work.  I recently received an hour long Ashiatsu massage (a deep tissue massage where the therapist walks on your back with the help of bars on the ceiling), and I left feeling refreshed, reinvigorated, and positively blissful, exactly what I needed as I was feeling frazzled and overworked by normal life.  The staff is diverse in their abilities and personalities, you are always sure to work with someone welcoming, kind, and genuinely engaged with your needs.  The spa has a warm, peaceful atmosphere, adorned with local artwork, hot tea selections (and sometimes treats from the staff), and it is attached to a yoga studio--so this place is a perfect hub for someone looking to have the full body-mind experience.  I will surely be returning for more body work, I think regular body care is important to my personal health, and I think Green Yoga Spa is the perfect little spot that Champaign-Urbana has to offer.
5	This place is incredible. Best massage I have ever had. Fixed some serious pain problems in a very short amount of time, and were so attentive and professional. I'm not from the area, but if I was this would be my regular place. They made my weekend. Thanks so much!
