3	Convenient cafe located right across the street from our hotel in Montreal.  I was DYING for some water and sustenance, as I just finished a 30+ mile bike ride around Montreal when I had only 1 bottle of water and some tiny crepes from Crepe Suzette to keep me going; so don't ask me how I finished that.  Let's just say I was spent spent spent.  Anyway, Van Houtte solved my problems!  Had the fruit cup (although there was some weird plastic wrap in some of the fruit?) and banana bread.  Also there is Wifi here, so if you are looking for a place to set up shop, they have comfy looking chairs and a counter against the window for you to people watch on the street.
3	I've had to stop in a few times for work. It's fine. The food is decent and the people are friendly. Nice and clean. Other than that it's a Van Houtte.
4	If you've been to any Van Houtte, this is like any other. Solid location this one, pretty clean and good service. 4 stars.
3	You know, I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with this perfectly located cafe in the heart of Old Montreal. I was strolling through this beautiful part of the city on a lunch break and stumbled upon this cafe. I walked in thinking that the inside would reflect the building- aged, a little worn, with a bunch of character- however, the inside was no different than a Starbucks you could find anywhere else. I realize that this is a chain of cafe shops in Montreal, but from this location I simply expected more. Furthermore, the service was very slow with only a single line opened when all I wanted was a coffee. Overall, my opinion is that this cafe was a huge missed opportunity to contribute to the most historical quarter of Montreal.
2	BITTER! ACID! Their coffee is quite terrible. To top it off -- no wifi. Why did I pay to sit down with the most bitter, acidic coffee I've ever had and not even be able to check email while at it?At least the place is clean, should you just need a place to rest.
