4	My A/C has been acting up so I called Desert Valley and they were very nice on the phone.The service guy was on-time and went about checking and fixing the problem very quickly.  He also checked the heating tomake sure that worked as well. I think he was done in about 45 minutes or so.He also gave me a rough estimate of when I'd need to replace my units and how much it might cost so that I could start saving for it.All in all, I was very pleased with the service that Desert Valley provided.  I will be calling them again... if I have more HVAC issues... hopefully not soon.
5	The service guy that came out was so very helpful and friendly; plus he was super prompt. He was at my house before I was! He said 3:30 and he was there at 3:25. He took his time and did a great job. Highly recommend this company.
1	This company came highly recommended, and lived up to their reputation. They were prompt in arriving and their technicians were experienced, courteous and thorough. Their prices for repair and service are very reasonable. Thank you
2	My air conditioning stopped working so I called a few companies and they were the only ones to answer on a Sunday night. They came at 7am and said I needed a new motor. I was charged $485 for the replacement and diagnostic fee and it was done within an hour. It seemed to be working so I left for work. I came home later that evening to a 97* house. I called and they came back within an hour. They said the new motor they put in was defective and replaced it with another new one. Not even a week later and it's broken again. I called again and they said they'd be here in the morning. So now I'm sitting here packing me and my crying kids bodies with ice in a 95* house trying to sleep till morning.
