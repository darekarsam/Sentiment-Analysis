5	Dropped into this store looking for an Angry Birds Star Wars thing for my nephew. We were so impressed by my man Drew's Customer Service, and patience , I'd brave another Black Friday to shop here again. All other employees seem to be too busy to help.  Drew gets five Stars.
1	I buy a plane with a remote but when I try it doesn't work I go back to returned . I ask girl she work at the store to give me another one , she told me "sorry we are out " but when I go check by my self I found like 10 of planes , I take one to switch with my old plane, I told here I found one and still u have 9 left. A guy he work at store maybe his manager he told me No don't take it again a lot of customers they bring it back, I told him ok thank you but why u still have it , u have to take it  don't sell it anymore , why i have to drive 30 min and waste my time. He told me " sorry  don't ask for discount but if u want to buy same thing good buy it expensive and I know u are cheap and save yr money better for u ,we know we sell same bad games with half price just to attract people but they get they refund, with bad altitude bad customers service. I hope the owner know that .
