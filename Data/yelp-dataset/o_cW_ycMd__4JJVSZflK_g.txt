4	The Exchange has the biggest inventory of used CDs and movies in the city, so even if one location doesn't have what you're looking for, another location might. I bought a bunch of CDs here before I started downloading everything, and I still occasionally purchase a PS2 game or DVD here. The prices could stand to be a couple bucks cheaper, but otherwise it's all good.
4	Great for used DVDs CDs and Games.  Good place to sell as well.  If you're needing to make a quick dollar, for bus fare of course, sell some stuff and the exchange.  You just need an ID and you're set to go.  It's not as great as Jerrys (for wax) or Pauls...  but it's still pretty awesome.
5	The most complete collection that I've seen in a music store in a long time!  The only thing I didn't find was a separate Electronica section, but overall still a great place.  Multiple copies of albums that I hadn't seen before in any other store, old consoles and video games, and reasonable prices (maybe a touch above what you'd pay elsewhere).High points: Huge selection, responsive staff.Low points: No vinyl (that I could see.. maybe I wasn't looking hard enough).  Parking may be difficult in the evening, because it's in a popular location.
3	I used to come here all the time but now I walk past more than actually going in. I can usually always find a movie in the $5 or below parts but if I'm looking for a newer film I've found better prices from Amazon. The $1 CDs are nice for exploring new genres and finding those old '90s artist and recently they started organizing it so it's much easier. My biggest complaint is the amount of staff. Although they are all very friendly, they're are so many roaming around that every 5 minutes or so I'm asked if I need help. It makes you feel as if you are doing something wrong. A few years ago my brother and I attempted to sell a bunch of CDs to them, all in good condition, but almost none were taken so I am unsure on how it is decided what is bought and I'd not.
