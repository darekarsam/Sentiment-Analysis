5	I just got my hair braided by Tiffany.  I got Treebraids they were running a special and I got them for a bargain.  The shop was clean and comfortable.  The staff were very pleasant.  The energy was positive. I will be returning,  my hair is honestly top 2 braids I've ever had in my life. I have live in Houston for 17 years and have been getting braids done for the last 9 years. They have a new regular customer.
5	Got my natural hair pressed the other day by Tiffany and love it, she really did a great job. I'll be going to the shop as a regular definitely.
5	I love this place to get singles done. Liz is amazing and so much fun. Her mother Estelle is also great and will play Reggae for you and tell you what ever the song is saying if you don't understand ;-). I love getting my braids here. They always help me choose what color works together (I just had blue braided in) their prices a really good for the quality (which is excellent). Definitely check them out.
