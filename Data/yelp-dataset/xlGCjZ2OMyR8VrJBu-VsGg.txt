5	Great selection that keeps getting better. Is easily becoming my favorite place for vinyl in the Valley!
4	Matt is a cool guy! lots of japanese imports! price of wall stuff is closer to ebay than reality but he is reasonable and willing to make a deal. Good to see a new shop.
1	The most absurdly priced used records in PHX. There's an $80 Dire Straits 'Brothers In Arms' on the wall (because it's an RL pressing) and a $60 Steely Dan 'Pretzel Logic' in the bins. That's right... $60 Pretzel Logic. And tons of super common records priced $20 or higher. There's a $1 room filled with records you couldn't give away, but they do toss a few beat up decent titles in there from time to time. Oh wait, did I mention the trashed Pet Sounds on the wall for $100? It's probably still there. One star for a very friendly staff, but I'll pass on the $40 Jethro Tull "Thick As A Brick', thanks.
4	This weekend, there's a sale here. TONS of $1 records and everything else is half price.The good:Did I walk out with 18 records for under $60? YES!Is there a solid selection of all genres spanning the decades? YES!Are most of the records well organized, alphabetized by genre? YES!The less than stellar:Are the $1 records in boxes and crates with no organization at all. Sigh, yes.Does the inside of this place REEK of incense? Sadly, yes.The fantastic:The owner knows his stuff and is easy to engage in conversation.Will I be back? YES YES YES!
