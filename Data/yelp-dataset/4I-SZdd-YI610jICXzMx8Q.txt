5	Uni is as good as if not better than any other sushi restaurant that I've eaten at in Montreal. The restaurant was introduced to me by friends from Vancouver. I knew that  f it was up to Vancouver standards than it was going to be good. I was not disappointed. Everything that we ordered at Uni was excellent and reasonably priced. The restaurant is pretty small and very popular so reservations are a must. Enjoy!
