5	I have been seeing Dr. Novelly for over 10 years now and I love going to his office! The staff is always so nice! And when I say nice, I mean they are genuinely happy to be there! Dr. Novelly is always friendly and truly cares about my mouth being healthy!
5	I have always hated the thought of going to the dentist, but Dr. novelly is so kind, professional, and gentle that I have found it easy to take care of my teeth.  I have been a very happy patient for almost two decades. His staff has been with him for as long as I can remember. They are also friendly and kind.  I wouldn't go anywhere else.
5	I love Dr. Novelly and Lygia, my dental hygienist! I first went to Dr. Novelly over 15 years ago. My consistently perfect experiences at Novelly Dentistry is the reason my husband, adult daughter and parents all are his loyal patients now. And they all see Lygia, too! Dr. Novelly is genuinely kind-hearted, patient, gentle, humble,  funny and really good at what he does. I  trust him and can relax. (I used to be a person who would start shaking in a dentist chair).By the way, his crowns are excellent! Some dentists aren't good at crowns, but his fit like a glove. Also he won't use amalgams with mercury, He stopped using those ages ago.Dr. Novelly is a stand-up guy. My whole family is pleased to know him and grateful that he is our dentist.
