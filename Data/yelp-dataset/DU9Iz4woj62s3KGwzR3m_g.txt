4	Ok..  So Dr Motsch is pretty amazing.  She ia very down to earth,  kind,  and a pretty thorough doctor.  My issue...  Is that my favorite part about this office was that they were on top of thier appointment times.  And now not so much!!  It used to be if your appointment was at 10:00.. You would need to show up at 9:45, you would be back in the room at 10:00 and gone by 10:15!!! Not so much anymore.  The last 2-3 times ive been here i have waited  30 minutes to an HOUR past my appointment time.  I hope they figure out what they used to do and go back to that!!  My time is  valuable and i dont want to spend it waiting in a doctors office full of other sick people making me sicker than i already was!!!
5	Dr Mora was AMAZING! I was so nervous because I am new to AZ and had been going to my Doc for years. He had a GREAT bed side manner. I am happy I found him. The office staff was super nice too!
1	Dr. Motch is great, she knows what she's doing and has a warm and knowledgeable manner. However, the office management and billing are a complete disaster. I've been scheduled for appointments on days the office was closed, I've been scheduled for appointments on days when they could not provide a given treatment. Even though we settled out of pocket with them back in July, they continue to send bills and past due notices. Calling the office is at least an hour spent on confusion, at the end of which they will acknowledge that no money is owed. Then another bill comes the next month, so we get to repeat the process! This has happened at least three times. Infuriating, and enough for me to sever ties with this group.
