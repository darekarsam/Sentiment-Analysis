4	Am I a nerd for reviewing FedEx? Possibly. However, this place has proved to be a useful resource for me, and I've been there several times. Mainly I've used this FedEx for printing and scanning, and it's been a pretty easy process. There's been a couple of times that I've wanted to ask a question and there's a bit of a wait because the staff can only take care of so many people at a time. But that's no fault of theirs. There's only two computers for printing, which is  bit lacking. Lucky for me, there's only been one time that I've had to leave and come back because they were already occupied. For the most part, I've been able to do my business and get out fairly quickly. I give it a thumbs up.
2	t's a one-man show here resulting in long wait times, long call hold times, and overall sub-par customer service. The one employee was nice but this is just a sign of poor management at this location.
2	They don't have notary services here, strangely. Hit the UPS Store down the road. Otherwise, they do have copies and workstations you can rent by the minute.
