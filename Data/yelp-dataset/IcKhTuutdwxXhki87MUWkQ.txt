5	Love this place! Small and locally owned by an awesome chick that really cares. Grab a latte next door at Steve's and then relax as they take care of you here :)
5	Got me in right away, very friendly & helpful. Excellent callus removal without attitude. Sugar scrub, moisturizer, leg & foot massage & hot stone. Simply the best pedi I've had in ages. Not the cheapest, but I will return.
2	Very sweet people lots of product.  Doesn't seem like the cleanest of places and my nails are lifting already. After four days. Rather upsetting because they are soooo cute.  Went another time because I had always had luck in the past.  My nails lifted within a day, I went back three times to have them corrected- on the fourth trip decided I would not be coming back.
5	This is my first gel mani & pedi. I am a fan. All the staff were very friendly. I am definitely coming back. Thanks Sunset Nails!
2	The actual polish job was good, but the massage was awful. In fact, if I ever did go back, I'd decline the massage. I don't like having my shin massaged.
5	Was so so happy that I chose this location to get a pedicure today. I choose due to the high ratings on google, and oh boy did I make the right choice! They were able to fit me in quickly, not push me to get all the extra charges, and do a super clean job on painting. I was thrilled with the colors to choose from and very happy with how friendly they were! It was $18 for a spa pedicure and well worth it.
