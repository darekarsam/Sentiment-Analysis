5	Just got the start of a tattoo from Matt Kuggs owner of the shop. I have had tattoos most of my adult life and I have never gotten more jealous stares since I had this one. Kugg's use of color and color blends are like no other tattoo artist around. Both Kuggs and Chris are very knowledgeable about art and what will look good on your body.
5	I just had two tattoos done by Matt. He did an awesome job! Matt was great the shop was great and not so intimating as some other local shops. I highly recommend you go to Body shop tattoo you wont regret it. I wouldn't go anywhere else for tattoos.The clothes are pretty kick ass too.
5	The body shop is one of the best tattoo shops in all of Pittsburgh and the surrounding area!  Everyone that works at the Body Shop is great! Matt, Chris, and Ron. They all go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable.  This is NOT like some of the tattoo shops in the area, where you walk in and they make you feel like they are doing you a favor to permanently modify your skin...at the Body Shop they respect you as a client and will treat you the same regardless if you are getting your first tattoo or your 100th.  I am working on a large back tattoo with Matt and it is so gorgeous! I am not even entirely complete and so many people compliment the art!  So if you want a gorgeous tattoo, done in a comfortable environment by awesome artists...check out the Body Shop in Lawrenceville!
