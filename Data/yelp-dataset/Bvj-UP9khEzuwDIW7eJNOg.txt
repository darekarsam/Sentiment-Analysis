3	This is a chain and should be thought of as such! Not the best I have every had but, the service was excellent. You have to get there at about 5:00 or wait for okay food, in a store-front location.
3	A strip-mall chain.  It's not bad food, just a bad location.  Their version of a fried onion with dipping sauce is the same you'd get at Chilis.  The steak was cooked just as I ordered and the service was good.This place is pretty much like a Longhorn or Outback, so if you like the two of those, give it a shot.No complaints...just nothing special that's making me come back.
2	Closed, and has been for a long time now.  Last visit garnered a first bucket of stale peanuts which the waitress knew we were going to say yet served them anyway before providing more.  An average steakhouse.
