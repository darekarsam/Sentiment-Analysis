4	So happy to see the second and closer opening of Nespresso in Carrefour Laval across from the garden area (across from Zara).  Today I didn't dare go into the boutique as there was a crowd controller and massive lineup that snaked around the corner.  I did stop for some photos!  I will update the review after my first official visit.  As per Nespresso the boutique is nothing short of class, elegance and clean design!  Peering in however,  it is much smaller than the version on Crescent with a massive wall of pod sleeves on the left!  I welcome this location as it will allow me to avoid traffic and time all the way downtown especially on those cold winter days!
