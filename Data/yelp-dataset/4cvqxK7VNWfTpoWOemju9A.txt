1	This company has a very efficient scratch and dent charge system. There is a detailed contract that you must sign and initial several times. There is also an itemized list of specific types of damage and their charges that they have obviously put some thought into. The detailed videotape they take definitely helps to perform a comprehensive before and after analysis.  All of these work together to ensure that you get charged appropriately when they rent you a wave runner without brakes that idles at 5 mph. Do your wallet a favor and just rent the scratch and dent units at the marina.
1	I will never do business with this company again. They do not honor their deals and they charge outrageous prices.  The equipment that they provided us was defective and could have caused serious injury. When the owner was confronted with the issues the response was "yea we know and we won't buy those kind again".  Not a good experience at all.
1	Zero if I could.  This place is a joke. We had a reservation for over a month and even called the night before. We show up at 9:06am (they open at 9) no one is here, so we call and they say oh sorry we ran to the bank. Finally shows up and says I don't have any jet skis right now. Poor customer service. No help finding any other jet skis. Said they would give us a cash refund and then said they had no cash. Horrible horrible horrible. Shut this joke of a business down. Do not use them!
