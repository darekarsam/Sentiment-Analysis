5	If you want your bangs cut perfectly, and your hairstyle to grow out beautifully, Fringe is the place to go!  Melissa has a rare talent of understanding details about how I want my hair, and not being afraid of telling me what will really work with my mid-length, super-thick, wavy hair.  The salon environment is a real plus!  I always walk in feeling a warm welcome in this stylish and clean salon.
5	Found this little place after I purchased a Groupon for services from Riley Rico.  The salon is adorable though a little hidden and adjacent to the Wigwam Resort in Litchfield Park.  Riley herself is a great stylist.  I got partial highlights that were ombre'd on long hair.   I explained to her that I had a previously bad experience at another salon where I asked for slightly lighter highlights than my dark brown hair and I left with bleach blonde streaks.  She heard me out, fixed the other damage and left me with exactly what I wanted.Definitely recommended.
5	I LOVE coming here! I have been getting my hair done by Melissa for the past 5 years and have always been happy with the service. The salon decor is great and they also have an awesome nail tech!! Very welcoming and relaxing atmosphere!
