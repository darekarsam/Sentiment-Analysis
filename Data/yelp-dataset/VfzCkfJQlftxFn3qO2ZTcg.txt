1	My teeth looked whiter when I walked out, followed all her instructions on what to eat and what not to eat after my 40 minute session.  A couple days later my teeth were back to its normal color.  Next time I want to whitened my teeth I'm going to my dentist!
5	The technician, Amber, was very pleasant and caring. She thoroughly explained the procedure and followup diet requirements. (She said to follow the "white diet" for 24 hours but I decided to do it for 48 hours which is what other teeth whiteners recommend.) The treatment room and chair were relaxing and comfortable, including soft music. Amber was always present during the procedure. She often checked on my status and applied more vaseline to my lips as necessary. I experienced no pain at all. The treatment was effective, my teeth are a lot whiter. Very happy and will return.
5	Very clean and relaxing atmosphere. Picture it more as a spa experience, rather than some sort of doctors visit. I've come here 3 times and my teeth always get SUPER white. Amber is very knowledgable about teeth whitening and makes you feel at ease. Unlike many dentists who use zoon, she uses Beyond White Spa which has no sensitivity! Very reasonably priced and I definitely recommend you take advantage of the yelp deal!
