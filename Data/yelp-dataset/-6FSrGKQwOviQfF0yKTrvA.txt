5	Kenneth took my divorce case and was immediately aggressive and had my best interests at heart. He was very attentive and always called me back himself. He worked with me financially and I honestly have nothing but good things to say about him. His front office lady, Gail is amaaaazing. Good find with Kenneth Friedman!
1	They didnt help me with my speeding ticket. They took my $100. They didnt explain me anything and cant get a straight them. I had to call the court to get a clarification and straight answer. Dont waste your hundred dollars. They will not help you and will not return your calls.
5	I've retained Walsh & Friedman for years,as well as referred numerous friends to them for legal assistance. I hired them halfway through my divorce preceding after firing my first lawyer,and got sole custody of my kids. Top notch law firm and always returned my calls. A+
