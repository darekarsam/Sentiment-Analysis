5	Great little independent place. The owner is there most days and makes sure everything is to your liking. When in town I try to eat there a few times a month. I don't deviate on my choices but everything has been great and made to order quickly. They have beer by can or bottle if you want and a very diverse menu. Its hard not to find something you will like.
4	HUGE fan of the food! Everything is really good here.  I do wish the atmosphere was a little trendier....it's such a great local place. HIGHLY recommend!
2	Smaller portions and food is pretty bland.  We got a calzone and chicken cheesesteak.  Just not very tasty!
4	Really cool staff and their specials are pretty reasonable. Never had more than pizza and subs from them and each time were great.
3	With a name like this had to stop for a slice.  Tasty.
5	Just stopped in for lunch and had an awesome Italian sub. Nice people, good food,good price. I will be back.
5	Authentic NY style (jersey) pizza.  Honestly the best in town.  It's a locally run business by the guy who moved here 20 years ago!  Thin slices made from whole wheat and fresh mozzarella. If you like this style of pizza then this is the best you will find.  Oh BTW the cheesesteaks rock!  Fresh bread, good steak, great flavor.  I got mine with the fresh diced hot peppers.  Just like you would find at the places in Jersey or Philly.The owner and staff seemed really friendly.  Good experience.
5	Best pizza I've had since I moved here! Their cheese steaks are also awesome. It's a little shop that serves really good food and people working are very friendly. We will return!
