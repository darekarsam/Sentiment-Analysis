1	Purchased a Living Social deal for them.  When I first called to schedule they said they didn't have anything available for almost 2 months. I had to agree to pay a $25 for service sooner.  The wood flooring we were having installed got delayed so had to reschedule our appointment.  It took me calling and leaving two urgent messages for callback and then she said she couldn't help me in the time frame I needed.  Worst part- she didn't seem to care.  Don't sell deals that you can't fulfill!!!
2	I'll give them two stars for being prompt and polite, other than that the service was subpar. After they were done, the bathrooms were still half dirty, trash cans had not been emptied ,and standing water remained on the hardwood floors. There was No sign of dusting or polishing upstairs at all and the upstairs carpets looked like only the middle of the floor had been vacuumed. Don't waste your time & money  with this company, they leave a lot to be desired!!
1	I would give Neat Freakz zero stars because they are completely unprofessional! I made an appointment, confirmed over the phone and was sent a confirmation email the day prior to my appointment. At the very time they were suppose to show up, I got an email saying they canceled my appointment, stating I was out of their service area (not true according to their website). Now they won't even return my calls. Do not use Neat Freakz ever!!!
