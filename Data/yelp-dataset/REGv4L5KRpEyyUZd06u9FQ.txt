3	My go-to coffee shop directly on the route between the W Montreal and my office, which I visit every 6 weeks or so.The coffee isn't great, and generally roils my stomach in acid, but does get the job done.  Personal recco's are either just straight espresso or a chocolate cappuccino.  Their fresh parfaits and chocolate baked goods add just the amount of sugar you need to get yourself started in the morning.Only downer is that they close early (or...I just work too late - not sure about that).
2	In a city with so many great cafes I am, quite frankly, surprised to see this place still open every time I happen by...Due to the business friendly location, I seem to be compelled to actually visit the shop on an semi-annual basis.  That is, of course, unless I am able to execute a successful preemptive re-route.  My last trip to Montreal had one of those visits, so I decided to make some metaphoric lemonade and do a review.I wish I had made actual lemonade as I might have been spared the overly toasted stale brackish brown brew they have the nerve to call coffee.  This is definitely the place to get a milk-based drink in order to cover up the taste and neutralize the acidic acid overtones.  How do you get a bad bagel in Montreal? Come here!  Honestly, after half a bite I was looking for a sign somewhere that indicated that they were flown in fresh from Oklahoma City every other Thursday.The rest of the food is melange of mediocrity that would almost assuredly sustain life until your next decent meal, but you're in Montreal!  Seriously, close your eyes, spin around three times and consult Yelp! You will find somewhere better for coffee, food, and yes, even the WiFi.
4	Second cup, you got some competition in Montreal! My vanilla flavoured drip coffee was the bomb, no bitter aftertaste. They have free wi-fi and comfy chairs. Also your typical supply of treats and sandwiches expected at a coffee shop. Van Houtte Cafe's are all over Montreal. I'll be stopping in daily!
