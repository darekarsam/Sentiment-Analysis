5	Dr. Stark is amazing. I've had several dentists over the years want to drill into a couple teeth, claiming I had cavities - but I didn't believe them. Fast forward 20 years later and I run across Dr. Stark. My original consultation was for Invisalign braces, followed a year later by Lumineers.  Upon her taking and reviewing my X-rays, she verified that the 2 teeth previous dentists wanted to hollow out & fill only had pinpoint surface stains, not cavities (I'm sure the other dentists knew that as well after viewing the xrays they took). She is honest & very detail oriented - my smile is BEAUTIFUL & healthy!
5	Great doctor who Really knows whats best. Also has a very helpful and friendly staff.
5	Enhance dental is by far the best dental office! Its really nice inside, and located in a great area. I had a over bite as a child that unfortunately started to come back as a adult. 3 years ago I went to another dental office and expressed my concern about my over bite coming back. They gave me a "retainer" and said if I wanted to correct the over bite I would have to undergo jaw surgery to move my jaw. LET ME TELL YOU, Dr. stark knows her stuff, she recommended me to do Invisalign. I hesitated due to the fact that I had braces most of my childhood, and as above mentioned the previous dentist advice. Well I must say I'm so glad I listened to her, my smile is Perfectly straight and guess what!!!? My over bite is corrected. She also put in 2 venires that look so natural NO ONE has ever noticed! In fact I've gotten more compliments on my smile. She really was patient, and understanding of all of my needs and concerns. Dani is her dental assistant. She is the sweetest assistant ever, they work so well together. Niki, and Janet work the front. Niki was so knowledge and helpful when it came to insurance, and how much my treatment would be. Highly, highly recommend enhance dental!
