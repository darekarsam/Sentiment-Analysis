3	Did a good job on installing new countertops and backsplash.  However, when the caulking started cracking 5 months after installation, would not recaulk.
5	Ben and Gelu are great. They remodeled my master bathroom in 2007 and did an excellent job. I have only had a couple settling issues over the past few years, mainly cracked grout and they have taken care of them promptly and at no charge even though they could of said NO since it is well over two years since the remodel was done. Since my bath remodel they have done four others for friends and family and have done an excellent job on each of them. Great customer service, competitive prices.
5	We researched our choice before selecting G&D Construction for our granite upgrade. They came to our home and explained the process. One if our biggest concerns was the wall in our existing construction was bowed and wavy. They guaranteed their work would accommodate the imperfections of the current wall. We selected our granite slab and they came out and measured for the install,  about two weeks later their craftsmen installed it. Their care and precision were astonishing. The granite looks marvelous. The seams are nearly invisible and the way they matched the grain of the granite demonstrated great skill. They installed our undermount sink, plumbing, garbage disposal etc. We highly recommend G&D Construction.  We will use them again for our bathrooms and tile floors.
