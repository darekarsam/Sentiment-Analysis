5	This is such a cool shop!! Unfortunately in my flat, I am not allowed to keep pets, which really sucks because I would love to have a couple of fish. But if I could then this would be the place I would go to. Speaking to the owner it is obvious he has a passion for his job and buys most of the animals in the store from breeders he knows personally.The shop has stock that would be perfect for anyone, whether they just want a couple of goldfish, or if they want a huge tank full of tropical fish. All the equipment is there- tanks and air pumps and small stones and ornaments to fill the tanks.I love coming in here just to look at all the animals, makes a great accompaniment to a visit to Grogie City Farm. The shop sells reptiles now as well as fish and even sells live bait- locusts for reptiles and worms for fish. Definitely worth a visit, even if only to look at the cool fish and reptiles!
5	By far the best pet fish and reptile shop in Edinburgh. Staff is extremely helpful. Owner of the shop have a vast knowledge of tropical and marine fish. You also get the widest range of live stock in the shop, whether you looking for, tropical, marine, coldwater or reptiles. You can almost get any accessories for aquarium hobby. Definitely worth a visit to water wonders.
