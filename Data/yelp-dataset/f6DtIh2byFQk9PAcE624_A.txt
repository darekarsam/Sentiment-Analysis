4	This shopping center has a little bit of almost everything...functional shopping (clothes, food, home improvement), food, drinking, entertainment, etc. The only thing it doesn't have that I think it should is a gas station. The closest gas station or convenience store is out on Alma School and 8th. Not a HUGE inconvenience, but it could be misleading the first time you go.
4	This sleepy shopping center has some good places to go. The Cinemark here smells weird, but you can count on the fact that there won't be any crowds.
5	I will avoid Tempe Marketplace like the plague if I can find a comparable store/restaurant/movie time at this location.  I love it.  Easy parking, great layout, excellent variety of shops and services.
3	There are hardly any shops here, and I really don't like cinemark that much because their popcorn tastes like it's from Walmart. I only ever go here if I just need to pick something up real quick. Don't go here expecting a fantastic shopping experience.
2	Ugh.  Not my kinda place.  Just a bunch of chain stores and restaurants.
3	Too spread out. No atmosphere what so ever. Tempe Market Place much better. With the non-existant traffic planning traffic backs uo forever during an event.Remove two or three anchorcstores and the place would fold. It is so uninspiring I don't even know who is there.
