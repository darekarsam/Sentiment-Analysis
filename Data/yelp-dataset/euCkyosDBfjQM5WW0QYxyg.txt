4	Good solid car wash, polite employees.  They scrub down your car before it goes through the automatic wash, then they towel dry and wash the tires which was nice.  Also have free vacuums you can use after or before you do the wash which is killer.  Only 4 stars because it's CASH ONLY.
3	The car wash wasn't bad. The vacuums are self-service and the suction sucks and not in a good way.
5	Super friendly! At most car washes it seems like they barley dry it just to get you out faster, but this place truly seemed to care! I am definetly going back!
1	Used to go to this car wash all the time always great service they fix some of the problems with not excepting credit cards and the vacuums  have gotten Better but recently however their new policies don't allow them to prep my entire vehicle at the beginning they don't wash it anymore they just get my hood and windshield wet and then when I'm exiting the tunnel they dry off my windows and don't touch the body they leave most of it wet so I'm going home with spots and my rims just don't come out clean anymore I won't be going back  unless they fix these problems my suggestion find another wash in the valley
5	Awesome place !!! They go above and beyond for you.. Last time I got a car wash one of the rims feel off and broke...  I told them that this had happened to me they then said hey we will take off your rims hand wash it and put it back on !!! The guy who has redish orange hair is super friendly I forget his name .. But super helpful car wash place and don't forget to tip them toooo!!I will continue to come !
