4	Always end up going here after lunch to get dessert!  This location is conveniently located right next to Subway and the Little Ceasars so once you are done stuffing your face at those 2 places, you can stuff it a little more with some ice cream.The ladies that work at this DQ location are very nice and friendly... they'll even work with you if you are on the fence about a flavor.I'm a big fan of the mini-blizzard sizes they just launched not too long ago. $2.50 and the blizzard isn't too big - you get your ice cream fix, maybe not an ice cream headache.... well I guess you can down it in one big bite and get one....Figures today it was 32 degrees outside and we wanted ice cream after eating some spicy Thai food.
4	Bad location. Good icecream!
4	Hopefully the new Fresh Market next door will revitalize this strip mall. The always very yong crew does there best preparing frozen treats, you just have to hope you don't get in line behind someone ordering hot dogs. Who goes to dq for hot dogs? Great ice cream, reasonably priced.
