4	What can I say. It is close to the house and is as convenient as it gets. They usually have what I need and work to keep the place clean. The workers there are nice and friendly and have always helped me out with all my questions.
3	The closest grocery store to my new house, and its not bad. The store is kept very clean, and it is almost always empty in there. I mean 5 on a weekday and the place is dead, but I don't mind that at all. Employees are always very friendly, the place is more laid back, so don't expect to have people waiting on you hand and foot, it might take minute to find someone if you need something. My only complaint is the meat section, which for me is kind of a deal breaker. They just don't offer a lot of variety, and most of their meat (beef especially) is packaged "family style" with huge portions. I don't freeze meat and I never will (call me a snob if you must =P ) so that is very inconvenient. Produce is usually very good though, and they offer a good selection of fruit that is nicer than most Harris Teeters I have come across. Overall a-ok for my basics, hate to say it, but I will be going to Teeter most of the time for my meat.
5	FOOD LIONFor an Asian supermarket in North Carolina, this place rivals those in California. Cleaner than Ranch 99 or Marina, and Lion Supermarket, Food Lion has everything that Asians can want! They have a large fish selection and instead of just frying, they even cook it for you in different styles, like sweet & sour, ginger and scallions, etc. The only drawback is they charge you $4 for the first 2 lbs, and the $2 for each additional pound. If you're Asian, lost in North Carolina, come to Food Lion for all your Asian shopping needs, so you can feel closer to home!
