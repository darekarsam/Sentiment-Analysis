4	They gave me a packet of coupons to eat for free for a "year" pretty much a burger for a week. Place is open 24 hrs and so is the inside. The employees are nice and friendly. The only complain I have is they take forever in the drive thru but other then that its cool to sit and eat.
5	It's Carl's Jr, and by far this is the most awesome one I've visited yet! They opened this new location earlier this year, and were handing out the free coupon books for their grand opening, of course my sis and I each got one!The place is clean and well lit inside, the workers are fun to talk with, and they're pretty fast when getting your order out. The cooks in the back take great care in getting your food out, everything comes to us fresh, hot, and nicely made - not squished as I've seen at previous Carl's Jr around the Valley!
1	Went here to get a teriyaki burger. They made me a turkey burger. No, it was not a misunderstanding. I went in to get my order fixed and was told I was not allowed to order the item I wanted because they hadn't trained the new cook how to make it yet. Unbelievable. Other items in my order were cold and disgusting and the manager (who speaks no english) did not help whatsoever. Utterly useless establishment. On the bright side i went to In-n-Out a quarter mile down the road and had the best burger I have ever had.
