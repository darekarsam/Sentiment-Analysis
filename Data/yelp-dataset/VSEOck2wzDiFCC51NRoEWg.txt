5	I would highly recommend Darren at Incredible Roofs! He and his crew are professional, affordable and honest...three things that are not easy to find these days. He gave us an honest upfront quote and laid out all the options clearly. Darren also make a point to keep us updated throughout the process. Thank you Incredible Roofs, I will recommend to all my family, friends and neighbors!
5	Incredible Roofs did a great job repairing a leak under our tiles. He even came out on a Saturday to take a look for us.  He was quick to find the leak and affordable. Darren was professional and courteous throughout the process. He gave us a quote for our flat roof repair as well, and we used his service to fix that also. He reworked/re-designed the flat roof so that it would drain properly. We were very pleased with the work and would recommend his service.
5	Finding a roofer that is as honest, hard working and talented as Darren of Incredible Roofs is a rare find.  Darren's work is impeccable.  This guy understands quality and a job done right.  His prices are also extremely reasonable.  (How do you find that combination anymore???)  He completely re-roofed my  Fountain Hills home over a year ago.  The job was perfect.   I am very happy I went with Incredible Roofs.
