5	I love this place! I'm usually not one to go cheap when getting my nails done but Lee does a better job than most people I've paid way more. The best part is the gals here all remember me and ask me about work and remember the things going on in my life! My nails never chip or break either! Thank you ladies :)
5	Had such a great time getting my pedicure. The nail tech was friendly and not pushy about up selling me services. Cost was fair and competitive with other salons in the area. The only down fall is it is located inside a very busy walmart. I will go back for sure
5	It's my first time to get an eyebrow & upperlip threading. Not a bad experience in a salon inside Walmart. Look for Sassa ( I hope I got her name right). She has very light hands. I might get a spa pedicure too when I get a chance. :)
