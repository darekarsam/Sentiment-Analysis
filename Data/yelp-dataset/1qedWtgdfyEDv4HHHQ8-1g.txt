5	Wow. I have a love hate relationship with this place. I love it because my husband gets so happy here, I hate it because he spends so much money here. I love how much he gets for his money though. Its amazing. He was in the best mood yesterday after leaving here. He is amazed by the deals he keeps getting. Not only are the prices reasonable and discounted, they have groupons a lot. So for 30 dollars you get 70 to spend in the store. Its ridiculous. We have had like 10 groupons so far. Its crazy. He has gotten so many good deals.Check this place out. Or send you husband with a groupon, then ask him to get you something expensive. He will be so happy and riding off his shopping high, he will get you a coach purse or something nice. Just remember to look for a groupon though, it makes it even sweeter.
5	Location is close to parking lot quick in an out
1	Great customer service but disappointed in product.Bought a Ryobi cordless hedge trimmer, but it had no power and won't cut, changed out battery still with no success.  Had to return to my black and decker corded trimmer to finish the job.  Really bad news is that I can't get my money back and not reading the exchange policy soon enough, I missed the 7 day deadline.  Now I have a very expensive paper weight.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.
5	Great deals on power tools & vacuums! Some brands include Ridgid, Ryobi, Hoover, Dirt Devil. What more could you ask for?
