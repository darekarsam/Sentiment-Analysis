5	Kevin bought Rose Nails.  I was just there and they did a wonderful job.  There is a surcharge for using a credit card, so bring cash, it is well worth the money!!!!!
5	I have been coming here for years.  The new owners have maintained the same level of service and charm as the last two. Everyone is great, but my favorite is Donna.  She is friendly and extremely good at "toe art".
5	I have been a client of Kevin and Cindy's for many many years and love their work and the personal feel they give to all their customers. 4 Seasons is their current nail salon and it is great. I love the location since it's closer to my house. Whether you are a walk in new customer or a old customer they make you feel at home and one of the family.  I defiantly recommend this place to anyone in the easy valley who needs nails, pedicures, manicures, or waxing.
