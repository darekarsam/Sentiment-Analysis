5	Amanda does a great job with my color and trims! She's always up for something new and fun and always does great!
5	I love love love The Golden Rule Salon!! I tried it out one time hoping this might be my regular hair salon and oh my gosh was it the best decision I've ever made. I've been looking for years for the perfect person to deal with the beast (my hair) and Sharisa did an amazing job! The environment is super cute and we'll organzied. Not to mention the easy payment process. I have never left unhappy.
5	I came in to see Lindsey for a hair trial for my wedding. She did such a fabulous job I booked her on the spot. When the big day came she arrived at my venue and styled my hair exactly like my trial. I didn't even have to show her a picture as she remembered. She did an amazing job. I have very long (nearly waist length) hair that from the sheer weight tends to not hold a curl long. Lindsey did a great job and my hair style lasted all day and night! Our wedding was in October so it was still a little warm during the day and the style held up.I also used Kay for my makeup and she did a fantastic job. My makeup did not feel heavy on my face and did not "melt" off. I have never looked more beautiful! My makeup and even my false lashes held up through the night of dancing, pictures and crying. The salon itself has an adorable shabby chic theme that I love! The decor is adorable without looking kitschy. There were lots of stations with plenty of stylists. The prices were not outrageous. They use Bumble and Bumble products exclusively as well. I have found my one and only salon.
