5	What an amazing company!  Joanna is so awesome and a pleasure to work with!
2	The communication and follow up with this company is terrible. I've never had any issues getting my rent from them, but it takes days for them to follow up to questions - and many times I have to hound them for answers. They are not a proactive rental company and I'm currently having to nag them about my tenants lease that's almost up. This is my first experience with a rental company, so I have no comparison, but I'd say that I Rent 4 You is not my first choice.
5	Helpful and trustworthy.
