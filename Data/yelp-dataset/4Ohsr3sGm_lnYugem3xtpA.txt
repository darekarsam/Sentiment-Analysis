5	Katie, this is a great new location for you.  The salons are great and the setup is nice.  The location is perfect to grab lunch and then have your hair done.  Easy access to the 17 and close to everything.  Awesome move!
5	Katie is an amazing hair stylist! Not only is she really talented, but she has a fun, energetic personality to boot. Great location also. Go to Salon KT for all your hair/makeup needs for sure!
5	I just love Katie Tan! She is so sweet AND gave me an amazing cut! I have been feverishly searching for a stylist since I moved to the area and I am so happy I found her! AND...she trimmed my bangs for FREE! I'm in hair dresser love with Katie Tan, and I hope she never leaves this location!!
