5	Brilliant idea! Heard about this company on Amazon Local. Talked to Wayne, the owner, who was very nice. All I had to do was put my empty tank near my front porch before I left for work in the morning, and he came by, as scheduled. When I came home from work, the new tank was at home waiting for me. I didn't even need to be there for the exchange! No more carrying empty tanks to Lowe's, Walgreens, or Fry's anymore! Great price. Seems to be priced similar to those stores, but they bring the propane to me! Will definitely use their service again!
5	Tried this service for the first time through a Amazon local promotion. My tank was replaced as scheduled. One less thing for me to worry about - it literally takes the hassle out of getting your tank filled. Friendly service and convenient service. Thank you!
5	AMAZING customer service!!!  Will definitely use their services in the future.  Business delivers high quality product in a timely manner.
