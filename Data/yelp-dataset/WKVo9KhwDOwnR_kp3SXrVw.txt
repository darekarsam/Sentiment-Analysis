5	Most awesome used bike shop ever. I have friends that have built entire motorcycles out of here. Cheap prices, the guys are very busy, just go in and talk to one of the friendly faces over there and see for yourself. I have saved so much money on parts, it is ridiculous.Love this place.
5	$20 and 20 minutes to get two tires mounted and balanced, as well as some angled valve stems put in (which I provided.. although they provide regular valve stems at like $1-2/pop).  That is just ridiculous.  Excellent service, great pricing, and a super friendly staff make Bob's the place to go.  I'll be sure to come here again for all future parts and services.
1	Worst customer service EVER. LEARN TO ANSWER YOUR PHONES. They never answer their phones, and if by some OFF chance they do, they say they have something and then when you go down there to pick it up, THEY DON'T HAVE IT. Or anything remotely close to what you asked for in the first place.Thanks but no thanks. They will no longer be getting our business.
5	Eric is a great guy. He is helpful and knowledgeable. He always takes the time to talk with customers and seems to truly care about people's stories. Also, if you need something he doesn't have in stock, he goes to great lengths to get it.
5	I needed carburetor parts to get my cruiser running.  No one else in town had what I needed.  It was going to be a 5 day wait to get anything on order.  I went down to Bob's and they sold me the whole carburetor I needed.  I got it cheaper, faster and got exactly what I needed all in one place.  The guys behind the counter are knowledgeable, fast, and pretty friendly.  I will definitely be frequenting this business.
