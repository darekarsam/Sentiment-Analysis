5	This is a new location for Stewart Auto Detailing. It's one of my favorite places to get my car cleaned due to the hand wash and dry (no machines!). On my first visit to this location, I got the full clean and wax. It took them about 30 minutes, and Audrey looked fantastic. I waited in the cute Hawaiian-themed waiting area under a sunscreen. They hand-washed my car, dried it under a tent (especially key with a dark-colored car), and waxed it in the shade (key for any car). They have various levels of car detailing, so ask about their specials. Check their website first, though--there's a section for weekly coupon specials. I believe this location also has a dog-washing area, so if that applies to you--bring your pooch!
5	Really I wish I loved here or more places operated like this.   I own a black car and it's almost impossible to get all the water spots off, I usually always end up wiping my car down when I get home.  This place takes a leaf blower and goes over all the cracks and crevices to get all residual water off the car.   Just genius.... Keep up the good work!
2	I just left and they did a decent job. But it took over 40 minutes to do a basic wash!!! And they weren't even finished, I forced them to let me leave because I had to get to an appointment. Don't go here unless you plan on staying there all day...
