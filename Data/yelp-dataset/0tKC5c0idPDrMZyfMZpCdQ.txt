1	Simply overpriced for what you get on your plate! I was given a  menu, and given a magical 5 seconds to look at it before The waiter asked for my order... Really needed a chill pill...Forced to pick from the limited group menu. I had to pick something I did not like from the menu. I ended up taking a prochutto antipasto, which was bland and tasted like it was sitting on some counter for 3 days, a tough dried out cold cut. Next up square of lamb! Literary a square piece of meat for 49$ smaller then my iPhone. The most awful experience ever. And it didn't even taste good l.It took 1 hour to get by basket of bread.  Then an extra hour for my meal. For dessert I ordered the double lemon pie. I can tell you this, it had no lemon taste what so ever. It was more like a lump of sugar. Slowest service ever got there at 7 left at 1045. Almost 4 hours of my life wasted.When the bill came around, I was amazed to find a 20$ tip was added to the bill.  I really was not a happy camper. Never will return...
1	This restaurant deserves NO stars!They robbed us by overcharging a $200 tip and manually written on the bill. NOT IMPRESSED! That's just a tiny detail of y horrible experience. #gross
