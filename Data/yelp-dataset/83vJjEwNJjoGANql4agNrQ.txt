2	Always a big queue...Slightly higher than normal...Fast student lunches.
2	Although I generally like Sainsbury's and this one has a convenient location next to the Meadows and the university, I always find coming here raises my stress level. The aisles are tiny, the selection is poor and the queues are always long no matter what time of day it seems I come. It would be a better shopping experience if they had a bit more space and selection, and if there were more tills to speed through the long queues. That said, when in a bind I'm glad I can stop by here if needed.
3	Just like their competitor on Nicholson Street, this Sainsbury's has been renovated since I visited just over a week ago and I'm really liking its makeover. Although the aisles still seem small and this store definitely needs a larger space to accommodate the demand, I am happy with the changes. There are even more muncy snacks, lunchy eats and refreshing cool drinks ready to take to the Meadows to enjoy the summer sun (now that it's finally here!). What is best about the new renovations here, though, is that there are now about six self-checkout machines in addition to a few staffed checkouts, too. The checkout area feels more spacious and much more capabile of accommodating the massive numbers of people passing through this convenient location.
