3	You have to love their samosas, just go get a batch and chow down. Just don't forget those samosas pack quite a few calories.
5	Completely vegetarian and great prices. Their samosas are great, and I particularly like the Paneer Korma and naan.
5	I thought I would add to my first review, since it has been awhile. This is still my go-to for vegetarian indian food. I have to admit that I am a creature of habit and I pretty much always have the Paneer Korma when I go, but the other dishes are great too, like the okra and the potatoes and spinach. Their Samosas are really good and flavourful and cheap! Like I mentioned in my previous review of this place, the naan is really good as well. I have just tried their desserts for my first time, and they are excellent.The decor is cute and the service was good the couple of times I ate in, although I usually order take-out. The prices are great and the food is super filling.The parking lot can be a bit of a hassle, but generally it is easy to find parking. I recommend calling in your order if it is take-out, so you don't have to wait while they prepare it.
4	Absolutely love this placeIf you're looking a delicious, quaint and very affordable vegetarian restaurant, this place is for you.Growing up in the West Island this was a staple restaurant for me and my friends. It's very well priced and the staff are very friendly. Once ( when i was a teenager) having ordered my food for take-out and realizing that I had forgotten my wallet at home, the young woman at the cash told me  I could take the food home, and pay for it the next time, I was blown away by the fact that they trusted their customers and it is for that reason, that I will drive all the way from Downtown (where I currently resided) to this small restaurant just for their samosas lol.
