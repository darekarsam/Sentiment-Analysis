4	This Shell's convenience store is really clean and the staff is super friendly.
4	It's the closest gas station to our house. Have to agree with Jeff S -- gas is always pricier here due to the locale. Though, a jaunt across the SC line isn't always a priority for us. Thus, this Shell reigns supreme when we want to keep it close to home. Staff is great, the store is immaculate, and they carry my favorite energy drink.Winning.
