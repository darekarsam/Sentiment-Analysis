4	I like the bacon egg and cheese sandwich in the morning from here. Not greasy and ya it's microwaved- but what's not in this terminal? The bread is fresh and the sandwich is hot. If I was a smoothie guy I would've gone to Rachael's but a solid breakfast sandwich
4	After realizing we had arrived at the airport for our departing flight way too early, the next thing I realized was that I was famished. The choices for food at this airport are about as paltry as they come, but it's hard to mess up a sub sandwich so I cast off the anchor and set a course for the Port of Subs. (Sorry, couldn't help myself.)I ordered a large Italian with all the fixings (except for onion). As far as sandwiches go, this was pretty good, especially the bread. The service was very friendly. I realize I am operating on a sliding scale due to the airport location, but I think four stars is accurate when compared to the other options.
5	On my way out of  Las Vegas, I stopped here at the airport location and ordered the Italian sub and it was so delicious and so meaty. I was not disappointed, I wish we had these in Chicago, Thanks
