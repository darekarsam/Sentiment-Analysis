5	Love this store an their new location , Bigger Better and a lot more space !! The new staff is awesome and love the new manager wayyyy better than the old one !!! Always great CLEAN stuff and 10times better than the 17 and bell location !!!
2	No organization at all!!! Everything is out of place. You can find much better deals at goodwill!!!
4	Good selection and price for soon to be parents (I guess all parents really).  I definitely recommend this place over Goodwill.
4	After visiting the Other Mothers at 29th and Bell, I decided to make the trek out to this location. It was well worth the trip! This store is much larger, newer so cleaner, and better organized than the other two. They have a good selection (Nine West heels for $4.99, yes please!!) and their staff is very friendly. Overall, it was a really good experience! Even though it's a bit of a drive, I will definitely go back.Now a lot of people have been harping about the trade rates not being great. It's tough, because you know what YOU payed for all your stuff and it almost feels like an insult when consignment stores offer you such a meager amount, but keep in mind, they have a business to keep afloat. They can't pay you high rates AND stay open for your shopping pleasure. They take the stuff they know they can price reasonably and turn around and sell. That's why your Jack and Jill, BabyGap, and other higher end items might not be taken. Best to try Craigslist or swip swap for those pieces that they don't take but you don't want to donate.
