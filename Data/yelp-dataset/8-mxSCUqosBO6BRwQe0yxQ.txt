5	trustworthy, honest, professional are just few of the words to describe the shop!! I feel relieved to have finally found a shop with the knowledge and skills to take care of my truck..I strongly recommend the shop as all of us know how much it means to get your car or truck taken care of without the hassle of being taken for a ride! They have become my shop for all my car needs. this shop is now like family to me.
1	When in for a sterring wheel shake they said it was the rear shoes went home with same problen And no they were wrong will never come back!!!! Went next door and problem fixed for a really good price were service was great
5	I have been going to SUVs & Trucks R Us for many years and would never take my vehicles anywhere else. Bernie and his crew are all very honest and their service is top notch. They never fix something that doesn't need to be fixed and they save me money whenever they can. Finding an honest mechanic is worth it's weight in gold!!
1	I have to say that these guys really had me fooled. The apparent owner talks and the other guy that has all of the GM experience tries to make things work,unfortunately it doesn't. When they tell you about all of the GM experience be wary.  They took more than 4 weeks to fix things that I am now having to redo. I am now wondering what they actually did. Check with the Better Business Bureau before you give them your business. Don't let them talk you into a big job. If you are not a mechanic you will never know if the work has been done or not,especially if only a year or so later you end up,,, wash,rinse, repeat?
5	One of the very few shops I trust to work on my car. Bernie, John, and the crew are great! They're very honest and thats hard to find. They get the job done right!
