4	This is a promising Craft Beer store. Plenty of good choices now and the owners say they want to add more great beers. The owners are very nice and even jotted down some of the beers I thought they might want to carry. They carry 220 different beers now and want to expand. They had several different varieties of Founders, Bells, Deshuttes, Firestone Walker, and other craft beers. They are also willing to take request on beers that they don't carry.  Support a local Craft Beer store and stop by here.
4	Nice little shop with a nice selection. Lots of founders and everything was fair priced. Go see Allen and he will help you out. I will be back for sure.
5	We were very impressed with a smoke shop that actually smelled good...and they gave a generous donation to our worthy cause. What a great place and owners are awesome!
5	I am not a beer drinker but actually found one that i enjoy here. My husband loves this place and the great selection. Great, friendly owner! Def. will continue coming back!
5	This place is 1/2 craft beer, 1/2 smoke shop. They ONLY carry craft beers, and are willing to try and get whatever you are looking for. Prices are good, selection is good, owners are friendly. Forget those mega-stores and come here if you are in the area.
