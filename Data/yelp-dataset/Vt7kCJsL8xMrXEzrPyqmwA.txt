5	GREAT place to work!!! Environment is SO welcoming and open...unlike any other place I've ever worked at!
1	doesn't deserve a star..not a great Insurance group.don't bother signing up I was a member for 2 years then what did u guys do I got laid off and denied my claim...don't waste your money.
1	very poor customer 'service' here. they represents the local credit union & refuse to pay claims...mr mckinley is the mgr there, let him know that such deceptive business practices will result in litigation, also a formal complaint to the national credit union will be notified of his deceptive business
