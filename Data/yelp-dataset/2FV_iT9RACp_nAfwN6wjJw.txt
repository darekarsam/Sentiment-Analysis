4	BBQ & Soul food. Kind of a scary location but if you want real southern bbq & smoked meaty ribs this is the place.The owners are really friendly people and take great pride in their love of bbq & soul food and it really shows in their food.Best ribs at the 1st annual Charity BBQ  Battle. I really liked her potato salad too.

The sauce is finger licking good! !This barbecue place has a food truck that comes to my work occasionally well they have started cumming inside the building and doing catering in the lunchroom the last couple times they came they were sold out before I got a chance to get any of this time I made sure I showed up early to get my fill of barbecue!They were serving two meats and two sides for $10 they had hot links barbecue chicken amazing ribs and brisket they also had macaroni and cheese some TLC potato salad baked beans and greens
