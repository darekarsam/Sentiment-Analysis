3	What doesn't kill you make you stronger? Seriously the place is decent, no real speciality but they get the job done. Perfect for lunches.The pizza is popular.the place to be on fridays for a lot of workers on the island.
4	I am a big fan - their delivery service is SOOOOO quick! As well, the place is extremely child friendly. The food is decent and decently priced!Their service is great and they recently renovated and it looks much better now.
4	We order pizza from time to time.  Very good.
3	Our destination for brunch when we stop on Nuns Island, Montreal. Nothing special about the food but reliable. The patio is quite nice on a summer's evening.
3	Went there like 10 times during my business trip in Montreal. Great brunch/breakfast during the week-end but their espresso is the worst in Nuns Island. Waiters are very nice and well organized. Clean tables and comfortable seating. On the other hand, the restrooms are located outside the restaurant and shared with the mall clients (and they look like hospital restrooms).
