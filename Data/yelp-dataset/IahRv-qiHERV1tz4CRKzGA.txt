2	The tanning beds are pretty good. The versa spa has a hard time draining sometimes. It's like you're sitting in a puddle when you're getting sprayed. Some of the staff are great but I've had a run in with some questionable employees that are not very professional. Which makes me question continuing my membership here.
4	Beds are nice. Best beds I've been in so far.  The monthly $99- is great otherwise too pricey.  This location had no body wraps or water  massages.   I do like the red light therapy.  But it's still an upgrade on that.  Staff is usually friendly.  One girl is always snotty...I like that they're 5 mins from my house.
5	The girls are always nice when I go in and everything is always clean. The spray takes a little longer than they say to dry, but otherwise it's awesome.
