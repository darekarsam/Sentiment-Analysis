1	Don't waste your time.  I called for a delivery order, and an hour later, it still had not arrived.  I called back to find out what time the order would be arriving, and I was told that the delivery driver had been out and came back stating no one was here.  Um, yeah.  From the conversation between the employees (one answering the phone didn't cover the receiver, so I heard the entire conversation), it was apparent that the order was not going to be redelivered.  If a place can't be bothered to call and find out information (even though the information was given to them when the order was placed), it's obvious they don't need the business.  That was my first time in trying the place, and there certainly won't be a second.  Tip:  Spend your money somewhere else, because these owners don't seem to care.
4	We order from here a lot. Very consistent and good. I really like the Italian meals. Although, they stopped putting mozzarella on top of the meals, which I liked. Never had a problem with delivery or pickup. It won't knock your socks off, but it is good and cheap and quick. Pizza is good too. So are the hoagies.
4	Solid pizza.  Efficient, polite and quick delivery.  I really like that I was able to order on the shop's website and it was delivered within 20 minutes or so.  I had the "Special" pizza (minus the sausage and pepperoni) and it was really quite good. The onions and kalamatas tasted fresh and the sauce had a nice flavor to it (meaning that it wasn't overloaded with oregano.)  The pizza wasn't too greasy and was appropriately thin.  Almost as important, I ordered meatballs for my three little Boston Terriers and they were over the moon about them!  They also enjoyed the pizza crust that I gave them. When I order next time, I'll probably try one of the gourmet pizzas.
