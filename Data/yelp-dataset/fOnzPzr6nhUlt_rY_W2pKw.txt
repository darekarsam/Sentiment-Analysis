1	Awful!  I should have realized when I walked past a table with 2 Dogs with only 1 bite in them.
1	First of all, please hire people at least willing to try to speak English. Second of all, make your food  somewhere half as good as Wienerschnitzel. The prices are exorbitant even for the airport, which is sad because the food is abysmal. My sausage tasted like something my dog ate out of the litter box, threw up, ate again, then puked into the center of a rancid casing.
1	My recent email to JM Customer Service. Dear JM Customer Service,I though you should know that Las Vegas Airport Terminal 3 location was quite the disappointment with my visit last night. I'm a fan of your location in Venice Beach location as they serve your product as it should be. The LV Airport location has disappointed me on two travel occassions. Both times the Tequlia Chicken sausage has had no favor. Also, they serve the sausage on a regular Hotdog size bun that is clearly to small for the sausage. Nothing like the large bun your other locations offer. The optional onions and peppers that they offer are miniscule slivers of dissapointment. Why even offer them? I understand the ridiculious prices of $13.00 for a Sandwich, fries and a soda being in an airport location, and yes the small portion of fries sucked as well. What I don't understand is why you let this location continue to serve such a poor product of yours? If anything, this location should be your flagship store making the best product your brand is know for.Here's hoping for a change.MSSanger CA ms
