5	I have been going to Tony for years.  He is extremely professional and contemporary.  Besides getting a great haircut I have a blast while I am there.
5	I have seen Karen for my hair for 6 years, she is beyond incredible!  Her talent for color is amazing.  I have started getting gray but thanks to Karen I look years younger!  She just started doing Brazilian blowout treatments to smooth my hair and I have never loved my hair so much!  My hair is soft, manageable, and not gray .  Karen is kind, gentle, and talented!!  If you are looking for someone who knows their craft and listens to their clients, Karen is the stylist for you!  Call early to schedule, she fills up quick!
