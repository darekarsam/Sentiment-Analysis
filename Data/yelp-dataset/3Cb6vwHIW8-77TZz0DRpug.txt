4	Ask for Mark for tow hitch installs! He was very courteous, knowledgeable and helpful. Knew a lot about the special needs for the Nissan Murano. Dropped off for the installation and they called when it was completed. Mark even made sure he meet with me to explain everything before I left. I would definitely recommend. Only reason I would not give 5 stars was because when I was in the store it took them awhile to acknowledged that I was standing there waiting. But Mark was awesome.
5	What a great experience! We've been in need of a storage unit and after careful research (done by my husband), Uhaul was the winner. Not only did their pricing coming in lower than other storage units, but the customer service is where they really stand out. When we arrived to put our items in the unit, the owner happily welcomed us and escorted us to our unit. He then proceeded to ask us if we needed any help. We didn't need help, but when we returned to our car after dropping off a loan, we found two bottles of water waiting for us. It was a refreshing treat on the triple digit day. The units are very clean and secure. I will probably write another update after we have rented here for awhile, but the rental process was a breeze!
1	Had a hitch installed on my Subaru. Paid in advance and made an appointment time for 7am weeks in advance, and confirmed by employees.Was specifically told it would take no longer than an hour, but having an got and a half availability would be safe just in case. Three hours later I still don't have my vehicle back and it didn't look like that'll happen anytime soon. No recognition from staff that this is an issue. I was told "ten more minutes" 45 minutes ago and they are still soldering wires.....This is a 45 minute job to do! Not a good sign that they know what they're doing, and they certainly don't care about service expectations.Poor job, UHAUL. Don't use this location.
