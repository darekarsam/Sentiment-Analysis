5	I just had an experience similar to what Aaron reported last year, only my need was for house numbers.  The people at Statewide were ABSOLUTELY AMAZING at helping me find the product I needed to keep my butt out of the HOA doghouse.  It was only a $12 transaction, but they treated me as if I were their best customer.Many thanks to them for their amazing customer service!
1	Omg what a crap hole this place is! The"showroomm"is very dark and they have no selection or stock. And rude person at the desk. U know i was just looking for something for the bathroom a four light fixture them place is very drab and dark don't waist your timr home decor id like to know where that is!
5	Thanks to another review on Yelp, I found Statewide Lighting! The address numbers on the exterior of my home fell off during a Vegas windstorm and broke into pieces. I have been googling and looking at Home Depot or Lowes for months trying to find a replacement.Statewide Lighting is the only location in Las Vegas (that I'm aware of) that has these because they contract with the builders for these types of standard items as well as light fixtures! Such great information to know! It takes 5 minutes for them to put your house numbers on it and send you on your way. Very helpful! I'm so glad I found them.
