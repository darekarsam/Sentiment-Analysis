4	Wanted to give this a bad rating to keep people away...
5	Why I ever went to their other pool is beyond me. This is so much more my style.  There's less people here, the service is faster, and you don't have to fight looking for a chair.  I'm a bamboo pool convert!  It's great!
4	One of three pools at The Cosmopolitan, and a beautiful one at that! Located on the 14th floor, Bamboo Pool has two bars, a hot tub, and plenty of lounge chairs you don't have to pay for. Gray bikini clad waitresses (and plaid button-down wearing waiters, but who's looking at them) bring you a select but delicious menu of snacks and cocktails. We liked the overloaded chicken tostadas as well as the Rule the Roost, Stubborn Mule, and Southern Charm.Only a few complaints; smoking is unfortunately allowed, and with no designated section we constantly had to move. Although there are shaded areas on the deck, there really isn't any in the water itself. The music could use some tweaking. Finally, the pool stays open fairly late but they stop serving food at 3:30 (drink service continues well past that, however).Still, a great place to hang out, relax, and escape the oppressive Vegas heat!
