5	Beautiful campus but don't bring any drinks into the conference rooms.
5	Went for a tour of the campus with my friend Amy and my daughter Kerri who is an aspiring pastry chef.  Very diverse crowd attended.  We were able to see all aspects of campus life - classes had ended for the summer so it was quiet.  The surrounding area is beautiful, with lots of options for walking around.  The tour was a few hours long - I lost track - but it was longer than 2 hours as the website claims.  A fair amount of walking was involved, so plan accordingly.  We were able to meet with an admissions rep which was very helpful.  My daughter, if accepted, will go using a GI Bill so the rep advised they have someone especially for Veteran's Affairs which will be helpful later.  Beautiful campus, beautiful area - we fell in love with Charlotte over just 2 days.  Enjoy.
