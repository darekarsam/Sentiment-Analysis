4	I didn't go in here to shop; I was there to film a promo video for a non-profit event, but based on what I saw I will definitely be going back as a shopper and brining The Becky to decorate the new house.Interior Motives has some of the coolest, funkiest, original and truly unorthodox furniture and decorations I've seen. I didn't get around to checking any of the prices but my friend, who has been there before, said they are reasonable for what they offer. I am writing the review because from what I saw, this is definitely a place I will be shopping at regularly.
5	I stopped by here on Small Business Saturday. I was the only shopper in the store and loved that the employees didn't hover. That's so annoying to me. Be cool, retail workers! I was expecting crazy high prices on the products but I found them to be quite reasonable considering their originality and quality. Some of their neighbors on South Blvd charge and arm and two legs for home decor. I'd definitely recommend if you're looking to upgrade your furniture and style from Ikea. :-)
5	This is no ordinary furniture store so it is not for the faint at heart!! Will Smith has an eye for all things new and different. If you're looking for what everyone else has please go to Rooms To Go or Ethan Allen because you won't find that mess at Interior Motives. I love absolutely everything and everything is one of a kind! You won't be disappointed, I promise.
