3	The guys who work here are pretty nice, but the food is as mediocre as it gets. I had the Vege Burger and La Vladimir (Poutine). Granted this is my first time having Poutine, hence nothing to compare it with but it was just okay and the gravy was a bit salty for me. However I've had many veggie burgers in my lifetime and this one lands way at the bottom of the veggie burger hierachy.
