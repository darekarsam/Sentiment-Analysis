4	University Club is a membership club in central Phoenix. I do not have a membership but have attended meetings and a wedding at the club as a guest in the past. You can go on-line to see rates for this under "membership". The wedding, we attended was a while ago but I distinctively remember how beautiful it was out on outside garden. The ceremony and dinner was outside and it was gorgeous. It almost felt like we were not in Phoenix, but removed far far away in some plush other land with greens and plants surrounding us! The food was catered by University Club and was delicious. I remember the staff being kind. As for the meetings I have attended inside the club, they were very nice as well. Nothing fancy dancy over the top, but had a lot of old Phoenix charm. The club is an old renovated 1917 house and each of the dining rooms are parts of the house, it's really neat. It's like being in someones home but not. Go to the website and check out the photos!http://www.universityclubphoenix.com/
