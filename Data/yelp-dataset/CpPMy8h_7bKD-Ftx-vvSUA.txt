4	Unfortunately, my family has spent a fair amount of time here and we have always had a wonderful experience, although the wait, on occasion, is unbearable... but, if you show up with a toddler profusely bleeding while wearing a swimsuit (mother and daughter), mercifully, they usher you back pretty quickly.  They were hesitant to stitch up my daughter as the laceration was on her face, and they wanted a pediatric plastic surgeon to do it, but, as she had already had stitches in the EXACT same spot twice-- one of those times being at a clinic in a county that did not have a plastic surgeon, I assured them that plastic surgery to repair the scar was probably in her future, and asked them to sew her up .  They were compassionate and kind.  I appreciated it immensely!  They have diagnosed pneumonia, removed a bead from a nose, lacerated an infected toe, given breathing treatments for asthma, etc...
4	If you have to see a Doctor urgently this is the place to go. Good location.Plenty of parking.Free coffee and wifi in the small waiting room.Friendly staff.Quick service.
5	I showed up around 8.30am on a sunday. Only had to wait for about 8 minutes to be called back then after nurse took intital information the doctor came in right away. In and out very quickly. Waiting room was more filled when I came back out so would just suggest getting there early.
1	Wish they would display there hours online in a more efficient and accessible way. Came here at 10pm last night after my buddy injured himself at our soccer game only to realize they were closed. This is after we checked online and what seemed to be like they were open 24/7.Maybe it's my fault for not searching better but typically when your in the NEED of URGENT CARE browsing the internet thoroughly while your operating a motor vehicle can be tough.**Note-This review isn't based off of any experience I had at this facility. It's based off the fact that I was trying to use their services and wasn't able to do so.
