5	What gives Robert Graham's new Cigar Store an edge over other cigar stores in the city is simple: their passion for all things Cuban. Alongside well known cigar brands like Cohiba, Partagas and Romeo y Julieta, they stock beautiful, limited edition boxes of 10 and 25 Montecristo Edmundo, Bolivar Petit Belicosos, Juan Lopez Seleccion Suprema and El Rey del Mundo Choix de L Epoque. To compliment the smokes, they also have a small selection of Cristal and Cubanero Fuerte beer, Havana Club rum and Mojito mixers. The thing that makes me adore the store however, is the fab cigar box guitar in the window. A homage to blues guitars like Muddy Waters, Son House and Carl Perkins, its made from empty cigar boxes, beer tops, baling wire and tins.
