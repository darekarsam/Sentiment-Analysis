5	I had a wonderful experience at this mattress store! I came in and the salesperson was very helpful and kind despite the fact that he was very busy. Michael was attentive, quick, and had a positive attitude and sense of humor. He even arranged for same day delivery and I got to sleep in my wonderful marshmallow last night!
