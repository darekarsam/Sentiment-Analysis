3	Kind of your standard jiffy lube. We came early on a Saturday, and got pleasant greetings from all staff members we came across. We used a Groupon and that didn't detract from service at all, as has been reported to happen at some establishments.  Generally recommended.
5	Had a great experience! Maybe it was so exceptional because of my incredibly awful experience with my last oil change at Tire Kingdom, but regardless, they were great. All employees were pleasant and seemed to genuinely appreciate my business. They thoroughly explained all charges to me and didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need. I was in and out of there within 30 minutes, which went by fast thanks to their accommodating waiting area. I'll definitely go back!
5	They took care of me right away unlike the other oil change places in the area. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. I recommend this place if you need any basic  car care.
