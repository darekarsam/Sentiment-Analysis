5	AMAZING service and the food was nothing less than perfect! The price was reasonable for the service and the food. I would most definitely recommend this place and looking forward to my next visit.
4	My coworkers and I stopped in here after a late night at work.  We picked this place because it was one of the few places in Laval still open after 10 on a middle-of-the-week weeknight.  The place was empty which wasn't a surprise at that hour.  We ordered a bottle of wine to start and a mixed seafood plate appetizer.  The wine was excellent and the seafood was average.  I ordered the Prime Roast Beef medium rare for dinner and it was outstanding.  I didn't even need to use my knife; it was so tender I was able to cut it with my fork.The service was very good throughout, but they did take a very long time to bring us our checks.  I'm not sure if it's because we were expected to ask for it, but it was at least 15 minutes past closing by the time they brought it.This is not the type of place I would typically visit on my own dime, but I would happily return while traveling for work.  I would likely try a few other restaurants in the area before returning though.
4	Nice food, good flavours, well prepared and presented , generous portion, took the tuna salad and did not regret it. Wide selection wine. Professional service. Clean and quite restaurant, not well suited for kids but rather friend gathering, business lunches, prices are 30-40$ per person even with the lunch menu but thats ok fir this category if restaurants. Would definitely come back again.
