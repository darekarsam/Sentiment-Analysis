5	Growing up, when it came time for a haircut, I would always join my mother at the beauty salon. Therefore, I have never been able to work up the masculinity to just slip into the barber shop, just never could get the nerve. So I moved to Pittsburgh and did not want to wait for 2 hours behind a huddle of college kids and a floor full of backpacks at Supercuts so I decided to search for a nice "beauty salon" type deal in downtown. Hair Plus is located in the Frick building, perfect for a downtown lunch break haircut. It is always easy to get a same day appointment. They treat you like gold here too. They help me out of my suit coat and hang it for me, do the shampooing by default, and treated me like a "regular" even at just my second appointment. Now if you're a penny pinching feller like me, a $25 haircut may seem steep. However, it is worth every penny. My girlfriend likes the look of my haircuts from this place so much that she won't let me go anywhere else. Joe is also just a heck of a nice guy. Highly recommended.
5	Joe's a good guy. I've been going over there for almost ten years, since he used to be in the Union Trust building. Never any problem getting in, in and out in a half hour. always a quality haircut.He just recently raised his price to $30, and I give a $5 tip, but that's not a bad price for downtown.
5	Excellent Salon! I've been to expensive places in New York and San Francisco and have gotten $200 haircuts that look awful. This was a $40 cut that looked like a $200 one. The best cut I've had since Ted Gibson cut my hair. Thanks Joe
