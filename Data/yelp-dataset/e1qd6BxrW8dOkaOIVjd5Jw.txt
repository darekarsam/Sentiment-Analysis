5	Dave was on time and well below the other quotes I received from other companies. Not only did he fix my problem, but also showed me how to keep it from failing in the future. I would and have recommended him to my friends and family in the area.
5	Dave came out on short notice because my garage door would not open. He listened to my frustration and added an extra call to to his already busy day to help us out. He was recommended by a friend and we are so glad we called him! He is very knowledgeable about garage doors, pleasant to work with, and explained all the details of what was going on with our garage door. He did excellent work and quickly. I would recommend him to anyone.
5	We just arrived back south from Canada on Friday night and found our garage door spring had snapped, we phoned a couple of numbers for service but found no one was available until Monday. When I phoned Palm Valley Garage Doors I was told it could be done on Saturday without a problem. Dave came as promised and had the right springs installed within the hour.Great service!
