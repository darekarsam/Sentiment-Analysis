1	A last minute meeting forced me to find a driver to pickup my visiting parents.  I call at 11pm, the night before their flight to arrive; nearly 12 hours later.Person who answers is awake and does fair job taking information and sending me email confirmation.   Later, a few hours before flight, I noticed they spelled my Dad's name wrong  [ALAN, and it should be Allen ]So I call, and he gives me some static about how it doesn't really matter.  And I was rather miffed that for 85$, including "meet and greet"  they would push back on a name change on a sign.   Especially when they confirmed, the driver had not yet left, and was hours before the flight to arrive.  So much for customer service.  But wait, read on.My parents tell me a huge story, when they arrive safely at my house--  The driver was friendly and talkative, however, :1.  He neglected to take either of my parent's bags  - they only had one each.  Since my mother, is female, you would imagine he would have offered to take her bag?2.  He literally forgot where he parked!!  They -- as in he and my parents, had to go out numerous, different exits on different sides of the arrivals area at PHX Airport  to find his car!!3. As part of #2, they literally walked in/out 3 other entrances, and took them an additional 38 mins, after they had gotten bags from their 4 hour flight.   Not the best experience for casual, elderly travelers.I would expect more from a professional driver, who would be doing this ALOT, at one of the ONLY airports in Phoenix.  Come on, really?  Anyhow, he did not help with bags when he dropped them off at the house, either.  Lastly,  did not even greet me, so I could not even try to give him any gratuity.First and last time I use these guys.
