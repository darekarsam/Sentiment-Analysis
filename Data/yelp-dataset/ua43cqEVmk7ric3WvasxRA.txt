1	This is the worst JiB I have ever been to. The soda machine in dining room is broken, so you'd figure they would automatically fill your cup for you, but no, you still have to ask them to fill it. My mom found a hair in her chicken sandwich. Service as crappy and our food took forever. I will never set foot in this place again!
5	Went here cause it was close to where I live and wanted some food really quick, and went through the drive-through and was greeted by a friendly voice! Ordered quickly and painlessly. Went to window and the lady was very nice, asked how my day was, quickly did payment and got food and drink! No complaints there. Got home, and food was good, there curly fries are awesome!
2	I've never been to a jack in the box before. I had heard all the rave about tacos and such. Unfortunately the overall experience was not on par. First, the place could use a good cleaning. My table was dirty from not being wiped down. The place had no customers. The trash can was filled to the limit. Staff didn't seem concerned about cleanliness or appearance of the store. Next, waited a very long time for food. The curly fries were hot but not plentiful. The tacos temperature was cool. Not hot. The drink machine needed a change to add soda. Staff again didn't seem concerned when approached. I left feeling that perhaps this location failed to deliver an experience of the famed jack in the box. Hopefully this is an isolated incident.  But not a good start.
5	I come here often in the evening/night. The customer service is always top notch. The staff are super courteous and they get the orders correct all of the time. It's always timely as well. I have only come through here once and had a bit of a wait time. At that time they apologized and offered a free drink. This is my favorite Jack in the Box by far.
