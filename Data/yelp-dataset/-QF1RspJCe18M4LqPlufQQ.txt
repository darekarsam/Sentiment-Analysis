5	What an amazing place that my 6 year old daughter has found. This place has given her so much more than karate. It is a family oriented place that brings strangers together. The instructors are absolutely amazing and really care about the kids.  My daughter works hard and it has been a joy to watch her exceed. The kids have to work for their belts and show what they have learned. Call them and give it a try, you won't regret it.
4	My son's dojo competed in a tournament at this facility. We were impressed with how warmly we were welcomed and the friendly atmosphere of the place.
5	Sensei Doug Clark is a warm hearted guy. He is down to earth and really understands traditional Shotokan Karate. I took my Dojo here for a tournament and he really made us feel at home. His Dojo is beautiful with wooden floors and a soft Japanese touch with a little modern taste. His black belts are some of the nicest people I know and extremely friendly. His students are extremely respectful and are very well trained. NSK is an amazing Dojo and I am glad we were able to come to his Dojo and visit. Thanks Sensei Clark for the advice and hospitality he have given us!
