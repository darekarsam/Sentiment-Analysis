5	Spectacular selection of high quality European shoes. Owner is extremely helpful and knowledgeable. A must-stop spot on Walnut St. to find unique styles!
5	This is an amazing shoe store.  The price point and selection are the best in Pittsburgh.  Karsten is charming and knowledgeable.  The store carries Tamaris shoes from Germany- the only place you can get them in the US.  The selection of shoes changes with every season and there is always something there for both men and women.  Great accessories too!!!!
5	Best place ever to get shoes. Great styles. Fantastic comfort. Quality materials. The ever changing inventory keeps styles fresh. Karsten is knowledgeable, helpful and always friendly. Best place in all of Pittsburgh to buy shoes. Don't miss out!!
1	Buyer beware. This store only gives store credit for returns. Even within the seven-day return period. They do not tell you this when you check out. A small sign stating their policy was pointed out to me when I returned the shoes. I understand they are a small business, but they should mention their return policy at the time of purchase or place the sign near the cash register.
4	The boots I bought last winter are still holding up great! I loved them and received prompt help when I needed to try on some shoes. I'll probably be back sometime this season to check out what they have. High quality shoes...much higher quality than ten toes. Even though I do love ten toes, too!
