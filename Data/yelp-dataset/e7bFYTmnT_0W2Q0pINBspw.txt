4	I like this high-end bike shop.  They hooked me up with a sweet ride at a great price.  You are not getting a Huffy here.  This is carbon fiber heaven.  I've taken my bikes all over the valley to get worked on and can tell you these guys know what they are doing.  They are reasonably fast too.  I like the lack of "cooler than thou" attitude, as well as the no pressure to buy anything atmosphere.  Just like the Terminator, I'll be back.
2	I'm a bike person. I'm in shape so I assume a solo gal going to a bike shop looks to the employees like an actual customer. Walked in, browsed for awhile, and was not addressed or even acknowledged. So I left, without purchasing anything. It's a shame as I try to shop at local bike shops rather than the big names. Plus the shop is well-organized and leaps and bounds above the interior at say, Landis.  But even Landis says hi and offers to help. I'll be buying my $100+ cycling jerseys elsewhere.
5	Super nice guys, with a clean, well-organized shop. I popped in from out of town and needed a quick minor repair. I expected to lose a day of riding, but they were done in two hours! They also let me pick their brains about fun road routes in the area.A lot of bike shops treat out-of-towers with mixed levels of friendliness. Not these guys. Definitely stop by if you're in the area.
5	We just bought 2 fat tire bikes. Wesley took good care of us. Give these guys a try they do a good job.
5	Couldn't be happier with my service and experience at this high end bike shop. I strolled in after hours in need of some gear for an early morning spin class. Steve, the owner, was on hand and took his time showing me around and offering me the best deals and some amazing discounts too! I'll definitely be back soon to purchase my next road bike.
