3	I love this place when I am back at home. It is tucked away on Montford, in an unassuming-looking diner. The portions are quite generous and the sides just plain rock, as I am an utter sucker for green beans and mac 'n cheese! My favorite part is the fact that they pride themselves in "Chinese Oven BBQ", so much so, that they even say on the menu "We invite you to inspect our Chinese Oven". The 'Chinese Oven' is in this window just before you reach the bathroom, which I always found to be quite funny. I get to inspect it before I wash my hands, I guess. I ALWAYS crack up when I see that. I took a friend from DC to this place once, and he enjoyed it, as it definitely has a down-home feel to it. Just one word of caution, DO NOT GET THE BOOTH NEXT TO THE REGISTER! The lady likes to lean against it, and that gets old fast when you are trying to eat.
4	What's on Chef Bill's menu? Barbecue, that's what. The interior is a time capsule right out the 1971 classic "Duel". At any moment Dennis Weaver may run in hiding from an evil trucker. If you have never seen the movie I'm sure you are lost by now. Just know the interior is shot in technicolor. If you have a craving for a burger I recommend the Texas Boy. I think this may be the largest of the classic Charlotte area family run double cheeseburgers. Basically I just get a small barbecue plate and that's plentylicious. Ask to see the Queen City Room.
5	Ole Smokehouse, closed with a big For Lease sign on the building. Rat's ass.
