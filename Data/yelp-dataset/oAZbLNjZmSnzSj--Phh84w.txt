5	Beautiful fabric and wool store in the St Hubert strip under the awnings of the Promenades. Walking into this space it feels just right - gracious puppy dog at the doorway, couches full of knitters, happy folks of all ages pawing at the pretty stacks of fabrics which range stylistically from 60's psychedelia, bold blacks and whites, pretty paisleys, and all kinds of modern quirky colours and designs. I could spend ages in a room like this; and pounds of toonies; and all my health rolling around with the golden retriever who is death to allergy-ridden-me but whom I adore anyways on principle.
4	I really enjoy this place. Love that they carry Colette patterns and the staff is always very helpful. They have big sofas and a fairly large selection of fabrics, including one of my favorite lines (Liberty of London!).I often stop by here on my way to visit a friend who lives up that way - guess I will be seeing her more often ;)
4	Not as extensive a collection of yarns,but not too shabby either. Lots of fabric for the seamstress as well. Tons of knitting,crochet, and sewing supplies too. Here you'll find wool soaking solutions in various scents as well as jewelry/clasps for your finished progects.Knitting classes are given @ $12.00 per hour,and there is a "lounge"area for those who'd like to sit and knit and chat for a bit.
