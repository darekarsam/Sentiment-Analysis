4	The only restaurant on the Holiday Inn at Desert Club Vegas property. Given they have a captive audience I did not expect much, but was happily surprised by how good the burgers were! Also ordered nachos - decent but would not order again - remind me of carnival nachos (nacho cheese sauce, jalapenos, inexpensive round chips - works in a pinch but not something you crave again). Prices were on par for a property restaurant ($11 burger & fries, $8 nachos). Very friendly servers.
2	My Friend whom I was dining with got very sick from his burger, mine was okay. I do not know if the server is extremely new but she couldn't tell us what was good or what the specials were. When asked she responded that "I don't eat here" 'nuff said.
4	Its a resort restaurant and bar, but man...very good. Might seem pricey but worth it. They definitely do not skimp on the cocktails. Good size meals for the price. Staff very friendly. Going to miss this place when vacation is over with. We've had nothing but good times here.
3	We had the fish tacos and they were just okay, we tried breakfast and the potatoes were the frozen in the bag kind, the omelette was okay but the biscuits and gravy were not that great! So good, but not great.
