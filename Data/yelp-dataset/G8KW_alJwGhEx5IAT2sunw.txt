4	I passed this shop every day on my way to and from bar exam review this summer, and I was just delighted by the little baby creeper hanging up in the window with a tallit printed on it, as though it was draped over the shoulders.  Well, shortly thereafter I found out my dear cousin, who converted to Judaism some years ago, was pregnant, and I started praying she'd have a boy so I could buy that creeper for the baby...and sure enough, her son was born at the end of September, and I made a beeline for Kidz & Co. Now, if that story was tedious for you, imagine how it must have been for the poor cashier as I babbled it out to him while he patiently gift-wrapped the tallit creeper and watched me fumble for the right debit card in my excitement.  He was indulgent and friendly, and I was sorely tempted by all of the other unique and adorable baby paraphernalia in the store.  Wonderful little shop - I plan to swing by whenever I need a gift for anyone under 3 feet tall.
5	This is a great store in a great part of Pittsburgh.  Their selection is eclectic and of the highest quality.  The coats i bought for my oldest son are so nice and warm and durable.  The winter selection this year is the best ive seen anywhere in the city, and i am so glad we stocked up before its all gone.  Highly recommend!
