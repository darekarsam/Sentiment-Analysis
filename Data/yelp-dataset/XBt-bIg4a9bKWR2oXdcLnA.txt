1	One of the wrost places to stay at, avoid as far as possible.
4	Nice clean hotel. Nothing special. However we were overwhelmed with their great customer service!  Had reserved 2 nights but due to bad weather chose to leave a day early. Not expecting anything we asked about canceling the 2nd night and the attendant at the front desk was so accommodating. She went above and beyond to help us not be charged the 2nd night. This level of customer service makes us want to stay here again on our next trip to Montreal!
