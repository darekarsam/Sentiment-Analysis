4	Nice place, many washers & dryers. Next to shops so hour wait doesn't have to be boring. Wash $ 1.75 per load, Dry $ 0.25 p/6 mins.
1	Let me say at one time this was a OK place. Clean all machines working/vending machines full and working.  Well something must have happened.  Most of the machines did not work.  Most have OUT OF ORDER SIGNS. Not good.  Vending machines void of all food and drinks.  TVs not longer working.  Bathroom locked and not a soul to ask for a key.  Never had to do that b4.   Its now a dump and I will never go again ever!   Thank god we only need to go to do laundry once in while because of large comforters that do not fit in our washing machine.  But never go here horrible place now. Sad as it was a nice place once and not that long ago.
3	Pretty small laundromat, MANY washers and dryers were out-of-order.  Wash prices were 1.75 (top load), $3.50 (small front load), and $5.50 (large front load).  Dryer time was in 25 cent increments.  In the Food-4-Less shopping center.
