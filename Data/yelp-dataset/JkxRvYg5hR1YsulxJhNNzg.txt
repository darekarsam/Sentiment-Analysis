4	Recently opened and I have been there three times. I eat a lot of Mexican fast food and Tacos la Lomita is one of the better fast food type sit down locations.
2	Gave it the true taco test of my three top favorite tacos. Tripas bland and soggy. Cabeza not as tender as others. Al pastor pretty good but pine apple was not in there. Tacos should cost half of what they are priced at here.
5	Best and most amazing place to eat. Any time any day. Specially on their breakfast burritos Monday-Friday $2.99 (7am to 11am) regular price $4.99 to $5.99 & great variety on them also.
3	It's not wow place , some plates are very good. I love the tacos what I usaully go for the  cow tungue, cow brain and  tacos al pastor. I go with my family to dine prices are ok , very simple place . Over in all it's good the horchatas drink hits the spot for a hot day. Try it is not that bad .....
2	Over priced for the quality and taste they offer. Don't think I'll be going back. Their customer service needs some help too we didn't get our drinks until we started eating and they weren't nice enough to even bring to the table. Simply not going back.
