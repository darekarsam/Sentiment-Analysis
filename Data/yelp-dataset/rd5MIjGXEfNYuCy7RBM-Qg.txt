5	@jargorestaurant Montreal is perfection! From #Scorsese meatballs to Dino Luigi bacon run don't walk to #Jargo ! The food will make you dream about coming back and the ambiance will make you feel like your in the place to be in Montreal. #foodie#Montreal#travel
2	Very convenient location, nice ambiance and architecture.Service was amazing. Downside was sadly the food...overpriced! Fish was overcooked and bio chicken a bit dry and too simple. Plus, they don't have a dessert menu yet. They only had a cheesecake with blueberries on top, which was delicious. Cocktail I ordered was yummy though. I don't remember the name but it was made of Elderflower liquor (St-Germain) and gin. Jargo opened two / three months ago so I believe they can adapt and do better than that.
2	Place looks nice, The food is pretty average though, tasted like nothing...
5	I'm pretty sure I added a bonus star for the ability to see clear into the neighboring bar's wonderful looking scotch and bourbon selection.  I think it somehow makes the coffee taste better?Regardless, the coffee was great, and I *love* the decor here. Takes the whole "reclaimed wood" effect up a notch. Very comfortable spot to grab a good cappuccino, have a quiet meeting or read a book, and yet feel like you are in a hip spot.
