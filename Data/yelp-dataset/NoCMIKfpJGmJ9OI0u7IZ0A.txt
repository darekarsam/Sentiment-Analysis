4	Great doctor Mouritsen.  Nurses need work.  Took along time to be taken care of but the Dr was great and very helpful
4	Very good experience for a bad situation.  Got in quickly, loved dr Layton.   I didn't like being moved from a bed to a recliner in the "holding" area. I could see if they were busy and needed the bed but they weren't, although the morphine quickly fixed that situation.  I guess it was so they could condense the pts to one nurse, which makes sense.  CT and XRay guys were great.  Very kind and friendly.  Reception area was clean and check in woman was professional yet kind, friendly, and informative.  If I wasn't in serious pain I would have enjoyed the experience and if I'm ever in need oe emergency services again I will return.
