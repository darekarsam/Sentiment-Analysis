4	Good for a NCAA basketball party after baseball practice.  Group just decided to get together at baseball practice to have some good pizza, wings, and a few other apps and watch some BB.  The pizza and wings were good and better than most in the area.  Have order from OP a few times and usually busy...pick up or delivery only.  The guy at the cash register can be really nice if he has a moment but sometimes comes across as a Mad Man Kramer... only short.  OP does have other appetizers that are good.  Also, have salads and Hoagies/sandwiches that I am told are good but only have had apps., wings, and pizza.
4	Very good place! We got the spinach pizza, cheese ravioli, and a meatball. The meatball was definitely homemade and very good. It tasted just like a meatball should taste, to me. They did serve the ravioli with a ton of sauce, so make sure you have some good bread to sop it all up. The pizza was very good too, with a lot of cheese on it. I'm looking forward to trying other items on the menu.
