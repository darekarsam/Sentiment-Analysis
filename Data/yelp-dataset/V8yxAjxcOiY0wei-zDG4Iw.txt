5	Awesome service! In home repair and service of our grandfather clock was easily arranged with a simple email and phone call. He arrived right on time and fixed everything up good as new with no added surprise charges. This place is the BEST!
5	Frank at All About Time did an amazing job restoring my grandmother's grandfather clock. It took several months between fixing the cabinet (dinged from a few moves) and restoring the clock, but it arrived today and is chiming away as beautifully as it did twenty years ago. A few little issues came up with the time running slow, and Frank called me right back and walked me through the issues. Very great guy! I highly recommend this shop.
2	A neighbor recommended Franks all about time and so I took him a wall clock which he fixed well and it worked fine.  I did take him an unreasonable amount of time to do the work though.In October I brought him another clock.  This one had only hands that flopped around although the clock ran well.  About 3 weeks later, I received a call saying it was gonna' cost this much and he'd have it ready the week after thanksgiving.  Bear in mind that he had from October to late November to inspect it, repair it, etc.  Anyway, two and a half weeks after Thanksgiving I called to find out when I could pick up the clock not having heard otherwise from him.  I was then told that although the clock hands probably needed replacement, he had gone into the clock works and now it doesn't work.  Would need a complete overhaul  to the tune of 400$ and would take him 10 MONTHS to get around to starting repair.  If you have a lot of time to wait and a lot of money to spend this is the place to go.
