5	Been using them whenever I've been in Chandler for the past 5 years.  Fair price,  Good haircuts.  Quick once you get in the chair (the wait can get a bit long after 330PM on the weekdays and late morning on Saturday).  Nice folks.  John (the owner, almost always there when it's open) is great with kids that are new to the barber.  There's even a lady (Pat) that works there that does ladies' haircuts, which is unusual for a traditional barber shop.
5	Just love this barbershop!   John has been cutting my son's hair since he was only 3, and it comes out so much better than anything he had gotten at the kid specific hair cut places (and at a fraction of the cost!).  Of course my husband goes regularly for his flat top (with no military in town, it is tough to find a place that can actually do a good "high and tight" and/or flattop - and John is great at both!)When my in-laws moved into town, they began going to the barbershop as well. Even my mother-in-law goes to the lovely Pat who is very talented and quick.  So all in all a great place to go from toddler to senior. I highly recommend it!
5	Great place for a haircut. Barbers including one lady barber are very friendly. Basic haircut is $15 which is reasonable. Wait can be long sometimes because the barbers are very chatty and older. Worth the wait though because they do a good job. Highly recommend them.
