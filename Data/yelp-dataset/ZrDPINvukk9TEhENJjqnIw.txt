3	Hubby likes going here for their "strippers" and cheap happy hour, so we've gone a few times now. They have a cool bar set up (with plenty of TVs) but honestly the service has been less than stellar each time we've gone (and by "less" I mean like not even close). Service is slow (we're talking molasses) and not that friendly. The food is tasty (we've had their strippers & sandwiches), and the happy hour is good. But other than that, I would wholeheartedly give the place an "A-OK" and not much more than that.
5	This is the only bar to go to! Literally, this is the only bar in the area. There is also a 50/50 chance you will see a giant Randy Travis look-alike.
4	The service at this location is always good. The specials on wings are great on Thursday nights. The reuben sandwich is my favorite however, very flavorful. Their curly fries with cheese added are not to be missed. Food is always hot, quick, and good. Their mozzarella sticks are the best I have ever had, they are flavorfull and a lot of cheese with a light batter. Yum!
3	I am a huge fan of Native New Yorker. However, this location does not live up to the others sadly. The wings were good but the curly fries with cheese were barely edible. The cheese was watery and the fries were mussy somehow. They usually have the best fries! I highly recommend the Signal Butte location. This one just didn't live up to it. My mom was with me and said her sandwich was really good as usual but again, her fries were worse than mine. He fries didn't seem to even be cooked all the way but were still mushy which I don't even know how you accomplish. Service was good. Atmosphere is a little more open and "lighter" than the other locations which I really liked.
2	We hadn't been to native in ages and used to be regulars. Last night we had a disappointing experience. The server was horrendous. We heard everyone around us being told about the nightly special and hh specials... we weren't told of any specials. She asked what we wanted to drink, I asked if they have IPA and received a five second uncomfortable blank stare. My salt and pepper wings were drowning in grease (I literally squeezed them with napkins) but seemed they would have otherwise been delicious. She checked on us for the first time when we were almost finished.  My husband devoured two dozen hot wings and was pleased which is why I am giving two stars. Next time- take out for hubby and I'll run to chipotle!
3	tried chicken bacon ranch bruschetta for appitizer.  very good..will get that againtried the smokehouse sandwich.  not to impressed.  will not eat that one again.  like the grill chicken breast ..maybe it was the fried onion strings..not sure..usually get a burger.
1	Decided to go and get dessert from Native after having dinner at a different restaurant. I was craving a cookie sundae with a scoop of ice cream on it. After getting the Nrned Y'er Cookie, I should have spent my money at Fry's and made my own. I received 2 large scoops of ice cream, which turned into milk because the bowl is so hot, and when i dug in to get that first scoop, it took me 10 scoops to find any cookie. Worst part about it is that when we did get the cookie, it was RAW!If the service was great, the atmosphere was rocking, then I would look past it, but it certainly wasn't. I will not return to this NNY, I will try others and hope that it is just the ownership of this location that allows such mediocrity and not the name!
1	We have not been to native in quiet a long time.  We decided to go to here and the service was horrible.  The food was just ok.  We tried to mention to the manage of the bad service and it seem to go in one ear and out the other.  The bar area is very loud and the bartender and service in the bar area was aweful.  They are very rude and just seem very uninterested in waiting on tables.  I would rather make the drive elsewhere to have better service than at this place!  If you can avoid it, that would be my suggestion.
4	Came here on Friday with to meet up with friends. Our bartender was totally on it and was really friendly. I told him to surprise me and make me a great drink, he sure did! I loved them. Would come here again! We didn't have food, so I can't speak to that, but the drinks were on point!
4	New to the area and we like this place pretty well. I like their wings, especially the ones that are boneless like strips. Its a pretty casual laid back atmosphere, sports bar style. We go with our kids though all the time. They run pretty good specials on Tues and Thursdays. We've had pretty good service each time we've gone.
3	Service is slow, but food is alright. Not many options beyond burgers and wings.
4	I have been coming to Native New Yorker for over twenty years. They still have the best wings in the valley. My only reason for four stars instead of five is the wings being too expensive anymore. Service is always fast and friendly.
4	This location is a little out of the way for me but I have gone there twice for karaoke night.  It was a lot of fun and not too crowded.  The crowd is very friendly and not that intimidating for potential first time karaoke goers.  As always the food was great and the beer was cold.
3	The service was good.  The waitress was nice and pleasent.  However the wings came out wrong.  After they brought us the correct wings they where then cold.  This happened with 2 of our orders of wings.
1	Last night we went to this location.  It was relatively slow. We were seated a couple of minutes after getting there. Our waiter came over to get our drinks. We all ordered water with the intent to eat some hit wings. I ordered 12 wings and a side of fries. Took about 30 minutes or so when our food came out. My wings and fries were so disappointing.  They were luke warm and became cold pretty fast. Everyone else at the table said their food was cold as well. While I probably could have ate my wings before they got completely cold, I was too busy trying to wave down the waiter to refill all of our waters. I would understand if it was busy or we were a big party but that was not the case. The management needs to take some tips from the Dobson Location because that's how your establishment should run. I live near this location but if I ever want Natives wings, I'll be sure to drive a few miles to the Dobson location.
1	Unless you are a regular here you will not get the service that all the other regulars get.  First off our waitress was awful. The food was ok but not good.  I would suggest to avoid this place if you can. We spoke to the manger about the service but apparentlynsince he did not know us it went in one ear and out the other.  Avoid if you can there is an Applebee close by go there!!
3	Dinner was fine .  3 of us for dinnerbacon ranch flatbread appetizer ***California burger with fries ***Garbage Pizza ****House calzone ** (top crust crispy, bottom soggy from the beginning.. )Service was good, we will return.
1	The service was good. I had a Cobb Salad. Overall, it was a good salad and the bleu cheese dressing was very good, but the bacon on the salad was completely RAW. Sorry, I find that to be unacceptable. I removed the bacon and ate the rest of the salad. I say: consumer beware.
2	Tried a Native New Yorker in Mesa when I first moved to the valley in 2010. Wasn't too impressed so never returned until recently, where we tried this location. This site was nice and new, I liked that. Bacon ranch chicken flatbread was very good, but that's where the fun ended. Service was a tad slow, and food came out ...just warm. By the time I was halfway through the dish it was cold. Looking at other reviews this seems to be a trend. On the plus side the wing sauces were good. Also, don't be fooled...their "BUFFALO" style fish sliders are nothing more than a fried fish sandwich with cayenne pepper sprinkled on top. Based on our experience it may be another four years until we try nny again.
4	Always clean :) the service is a tad slow each time I come but enough TVs and trivia keep you distracted from the wait..... And good company of course. Different days have different specials so that's nice as well.
1	One on the worst places i have ate while living in az. 5 people ate for $65.00 what a joke, $5 for a small plate of fries,$9 for 12 wings and so on. Food quality was horrible and so was the price. Wish i would have read some reviews before going, if this is a franchise they are not keeping up just hope others are not like this. Someone from the health department needs to be called .
5	I came to this place just to catch some wings nothing extraordinary we thought. We had a coupon since my husband and I moved in the area not long ago. I just gotta say that service was out of this orbit great. Since we opened the door the manager that was leaving for the day greeted and welcomed us very friendly. And then the server was nothing but sweet and checked up on us regularly instead of abandoning us. The manager also came and checked the table and at the end the server pre bussed the table promptly for us to enjoy a little time after dinner instead of leaving us with our plates all dirty. I got a wedge salad and some wings. My husband got a Philly steak. We were really pleased. Great prices too. :) we will be back. Thank you Sami. We will definitely look for your station whenever we make it back.
2	Ok so this is actually our 2nd time here. Let's just say the first time around was forgetful. We decided to try this place one more time since the kids wanted wings. Waiting for your food to come still takes forever and it wasn't even busy. The servers were nice but I can't bring myself to come here again.
1	Eh. Lackluster and overpriced food.  Their wings are pretty wimpy. The service is either just ok or really bad. Their mixed drinks on special feature cheap well liquor. I'm not asking for Grey Goose, but the vodka tasted like it came from a plastic bottle. I'm a big house salad eater, and theirs are only served with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes on top. How bout some onions and croutons?!  But seriously,  the food isn't what it used to be at other locations ~10 years ago or so. We don't come in anymore because it's always an expensive way to just leave disappointed.
2	This is my first time coming to Native after the logo has changed ,but the second time overall. My first experience was repeated this next go around. . .Positives:1. The restaurant was clean and considerably "busy" given it was a Tuesday night and no football . . . to my knowledge . . . was on.2. Our waiter was friendly, when he showed up. I'll give this a pass as he seemed to be the only one working.3. This is an odd positive but i do enjoy booth seating where the booths are large enough to fit more than four people. While that was not needed this time, it was a mental note I made if I come here with a softball group or a impromptu gathering.Negatives:All of it was related to food . . .1. Food was cold.2. The wings were smothered in wing sauce. Which is usually a complaint I have, but the sauce was cold.3. The beer tasted flat. I am not sure if that was the problem of the restaurant or the brewery but the Kilt Lifter tasted like it had been there for several weeks. 4. The wrong food came out. . . we didn't say anything to our waiter because we couldn't locate him most of the time, but I doubt the correct order would have been any different as most of it was cold.This just isn't going to be a place I want to frequent. Maybe if I am super hungry and there is minimal wait, other than that this place is pretty forgetful.
