5	The Junk Queen did an efficient job removing unwanted tv's, pallets, and other random junk from my garage. They work quickly and efficiently. I recommend them to my friends and business associates.
5	This business owner was my Christmas Angel. We had ordered a new sofa and it was delivered on Christmas Eve morning. When I purchased the sofa the sales person stated the delivery people would take my old one away. They could not take it and I understood why after their explanation. However, this left me with two huge sofa's in one small room. My condo is the size of a shoebox. I found the phone number for Junk Queens and asked if they could pick up the sofa. He stated he could, would come that afternoon. He arrived on time, and by himself took away the old sofa and ottoman. His price was fair. I would use this business again in a heart beat. Thank you Junk Queens.
