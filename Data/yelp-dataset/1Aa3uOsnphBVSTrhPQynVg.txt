5	The best chocolate in town! Fresh, creaminess that melts in your mouth and tingles your senses. Aaaaaaahhhh-mazing!
5	Rubens is back. If you are a Champaign native, this is all you need to know. If you are not or have only arrived in town in the past four or so years, know that this is the best hand-crafted chocolate you are going to get outside of Belgium.  Yes, its pricey. Its worth it.
5	Best chocolatier in town! I got an assorted box as a gift, and omg they are amazing. They were so smooth and creamy. The guilt fillings were real fruit, not that syrup stuff. My favorite was the crystallized ginger covered truffle. The chocolate and ginger combo was awesome! I will be going back!
