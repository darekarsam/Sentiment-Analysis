1	I was calling to inquire about delivery to a certain area that was not represented on the site. The woman who answered the phone acted like I was inconviencing her with my silly questions.  I was also told that they don't deliver to certain areas during holiday weeks.  Isn't that the whole point of ordering one of the arrangements?  I won't be calling back and ordering from this store ever.
5	Great customer service and always willing to help! My mom wasn't home at the time of the delivery and instead of just leaving, they were kind enough to call a couple different times to reschedule another re delivery. They weren't able to reach her for a couple days but instead of it seeming like an inconvenience they remade a new one and took it right back out as soon as she called! I will continue to use them for all my gift giving needs!
