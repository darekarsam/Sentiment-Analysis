3	Wow, the next time I have a hot date to impress I'm coming here.  The clothes are fashionable complete with shoes and purses to match.  Perhaps I should explain quickly that I'm talking about the women's store, TRCW as some call it.  The original store specializes in swanky men's fashion.  But the women's store is very upscale and impressive.  The dresses are beautiful and flattering and the shoes are fantastic.  The only down side is the price, it's a little rich for my blood.  Maybe one day when I snag myself a dream job, or a rich man, whichever comes first.
5	Top-notch personal service and exquisite men's and women's fashion apparel. If you're not on a budget, you can't go wrong with Taylor, Richards, and Conger. Plus, the relocated Charlotte outpost of noted fashion designer Billy Reid is at TRC. Highly recommended, but bring your credit cards.
5	Hands down, the best men's clothier in Charlotte. TRC carries casual wear to upscale suiting in high quality brands that are modern yet classic. The service cannot be matched.
5	Thank God you guys are here, smaller and more personal than Neiman's but, actually has a better curated selection for men
4	Nice selection of higher end clothing. Staff are eager to help you find the style and size that you need.  It is pricey, but they do have nice clothing and personal service that set them apart from larger stores.
