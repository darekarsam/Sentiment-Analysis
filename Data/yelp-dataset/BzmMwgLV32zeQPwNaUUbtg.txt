4	Lived in a JSM managed apartment for the 2009-2010 school year at the recommendation of the Tennant Union.I didn't have any major problems. They had a quick and friendly maintenance staff.  One time I came home at 3am and there was a maintenance guy fixing a leak that the tenants in the lower floors had complained about, so I know emergency maintenance gets done quickly as well.On move-out I was charged a lot for cleaning, despite having cleaned some myself.  I showed the pictures I had taken when I moved out to the leasing office manager.  In the end they returned a fair amount of my deposit without having to complain to the Tennant Union.  Expect to be charged for carpet cleaning (I think it says it in the lease) and always take move-in and move-out pictures.Overall, one of the better large management companies on campus. People might know this because their apartments fill up fast.  Consequently there is usually no room for negotiation with these guys.  I will consider them for future apartments.
1	Lived in 405 E White St, champaign for half a year. It was totally a nightmare, I am soo glad I will move out tmr. When we moved here in August, JSM forgot to remold hot water tunnels in our bathroom, we had to take showers in ARC for three days. There was no window screen for a month, we pushed the office several times and they came up with several excuses. There was even a crack in the wall, they fixed it in Dec, however, maintainence left their knife in my bed... The WORST is, they have bedbugs. Although they did pest control once, but we found a bed bug in bed recently. Anyway, never resident in 405 E white!
4	This review may be jumping the gun (***update below***) but I've already had memorable experiences with JSM. I'll continue to develop this review as my lease wears on. Almost everyone at JSM is timely, professional, polite, friendly, and knowledgeable. Their professionalism and organization are stellar, and the extra touches, like the convenient blue folders they love to dole out, though simple, really polish it off.Signing with JSM was a pleasant, hassle free experience. They have cars to take visitors on apartment tours and they allow you all the time you need to read the lease in a private room. This, for me, underlined that they are not in the business of deception. No pressure at all except from the multitude of prospective tenants eagerly waiting to snatch available apartments.Move-in was a breeze. I did have issues with my apartment: aggressive mold, a moldy mattress box, a few broken odds and ends, and a building-wide roach problem *shudder*. My preliminary visit to the apartment was problem-free, so I assume most of these occurred during a hot and humid summer of neglect. I was worried that I had been swindled once more... but fear not, the speed and courteousness with which JSM handled everything was AWE-INSPIRING. Everything was fixed the day of or the next day by the super-nice, super-skilled maintenance staff. It was a rental miracle. Hail, JSM. PRAISE BE THE THREE-LETTERED DIVINITY THAT IS JSM.My apartment smells like feet (though a carpet cleaning should have been in order at the termination of the last tenant's lease), I just squashed a roach, and I spoke with one office staff member who must have had the other end of the phone stuck up her prolapsing anus but otherwise, I am pretty happy. JSM is great. A little overpriced if we're talking about the apartment itself, but I can justify it because I'm paying for a reliable landlord.***Update*** The roach problem is out of control. I've been afraid to eat here or turn on the sink lest I leave a stray water droplet out for these thirsty bastards. There are roaches -----in my bed-----, under appliances, crawling into and out of outlet plates. I see grandaddy roaches and pinhole sized babies and everything in between. And one just crawled into my blender!!! I was making a smoothie and lifted the container out only to find a roach crawling back into the portion that contains the motor. After this incident I checked my electric water boiler. Yup. Roaches had crawled in overnight. Ah! I had been keeping the boiler in my fridge to keep it from infestation but after treatment, I had been too optimistic and started leaving it out. My apartment has already been sprayed three times now. This, of course, is a problem with the building, not the landlord. JSM is still as polite and professional as ever and they've contacted me to work out a more robust solution.
1	Parents, be aware of JSM.  After my daughter spent a difficult year of slow repairs, a cracked window in the dead of winter, dirt and noise, your security deposit will come back with a lot of over-stated charges.  Even though the apartment was dirty at move-in (broken glass in the kitchen, desk drawers still filled with items,etc.) the move-out charges included $275.00 for general cleaning, $145.00 for alleged carpet cleaning (again, we found dirty carpet at move in) and a $60.00 maintenance charge to change the lock on the front door.   I'm sure they paid someone way less than $275.00 to clean an empty apartment!  Contrast with Tower at 3rd for a $40.00 move-out carpet cleaning.
1	Wanted to let people know that it is my belief that JSM Management will use your Security Deposit to clean apartment ($450.00), manage locks/keys($60.00) and clean carpet($160) when you move out.  This is not standard business practice, but they feel that they have a right to do this.  I was told that the carpet cleaning is in the lease.   My daughter and her roomates cleaned their apartment and took pictures of it but we were told that the sinks were not shiny so it cost them $450.00.  After I wrote a complaint letter they agreed to give me an additional $56.25.   If there is anyone that rented from them and didn't get charged these fees, please post here, because I believe that they are doing this to everyone.
