4	I find this location very convenient and the service here is quick and efficient. If there is no one waiting, you can expect to be in and out in 10-15 minutes.I frequent this place quite often. They have coupons available at most locations(am not sure if they are available at this particular location) which means that you get a discount when you buy several eyebrow threading coupons in advance.
5	Quick, convenient location. If you go at night their sign is difficult to spot. The shop is located between the Paradise Salon and East Coast Eatery In the Kohl's shopping center off Valle Verde. I called a couple times for since I couldn't find it, and I got some directions in very broken English, but the lady was very helpful over the phone. Service was good, very pleasant lady, attempted some small talk. Plus the price is awesome - $7 Mon-Sat I believe. My eyebrows turned out nice and clean. Will definitely be back!

3	I've gone here a few times now and I have definitely had better experiences at other threading salons, but this place is nearby and the wait is never too long so I go back when I need a touch up. I would definitely go somewhere else if re-shaping is needed though, as I've come out with uneven brows a couple of times. They are a little more abrasive with their threading than I would like...I've come out with cuts in the past. Overall though, decent place for a clean up.
