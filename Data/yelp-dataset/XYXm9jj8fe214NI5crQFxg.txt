3	Smack-Dab in the middle of one of the University City shopping strips, Gandhi International Market is always bombing with business. Fitting to the expression "good things come in small packages," Gandhi International Market is jam-packed with some great food finds from all over the world. The market provides customers with a huge selection of fresh fruits, veggies, rice and beans among other universal staples. Towards the back of the store you will find a freezer section full of delectable meats & sweets treats. After you've made all your selections make your way to the front of the store for check out. While Gandhi International Market offers standard customer service, I wasn't really wow-ed. The staff members were very pleasant and answered my numerous questions about the different cultures and foods represented in the store. But when I was ready for check out I ended up waiting in a rather long line because the store only has two working registers; not really efficient. So if you have the spare time to check out a new place, and are in the mood to try out exciting new foods, I suggest you swing by Gandhi International Market and put a little twist into your typical grocery store trip.
1	So unorganized, several expired products and not at all fresh vegetables sums up this shop.  Go to Rajbhog even if it takes that extra 2 miles
1	I am giving 1 star because no option for zero ... I got 5 products from this store ... Out of 5, 3 of them are expired .... Went back for return, the staff is so harsh and they wont take back .... Poor poor indian attitude ....
