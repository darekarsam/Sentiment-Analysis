3	Came for lunch today. It's located in a strip mall with other shops and restaurants. I ordered hibachi steak, which came with a soup or salad, and fried rice. Price was reasonable at $7.25. First, the salad. It was generic iceberg lettuce. The "house" dressing was actually a pretty good ginger dressing. For the type of place, the salad was acceptable. The hibachi was next. The food was ok. Really nothing spectacular. The rice was decent, meat was decent, veggies were overcooked and mushy. Overall, for $7, the meal was decent. Could have been cooked better. Overall the meal was ok.
3	I came here for lunch today. It was decent, not the best Japanese food I've had but not the worst either. It was pretty slow for it being lunch time (only two other people sitting down when I came in) The lunch menu is reasonable prices. I got the hibachi shrimp and a tea for less than $9. I believe the hibachi shrimp was about $6.50 (somewhere around there) as the last reviewer said the veggies were mushy, but the shrimp and rice were good and so was the shrimp sauce. Salad dressing was a little watery. If you are looking for a quick cheap lunch that is decent this is your place.
4	We came with our kids for an early dinner. Our first impression was underwhelming but the food saved it! The yakitori melts in your mouth. The pork shumai were amazing! The noodle dishes were good, but could have benefitted from more sauce. Overall excellent!
1	Barf** i just ate the equivalent of salt from a salt shaker. Stay away from there flounder!! Actually no just don't come here it's just puke.
1	STAY AWAY!!  The food was absolutely some of the worst I've eaten.  There is nothing Japanese about the cuisine.  Meat either overcooked or heated in a microwave.  Steak, chicken and shrimp with rubber consistency.  Vegetables overcooked.  Sushi didn't appear to be fresh.......Everything thrown in the garbage.  Wasted money!!
