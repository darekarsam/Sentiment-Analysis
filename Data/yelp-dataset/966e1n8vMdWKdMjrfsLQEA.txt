5	DOs might be better than MDs. I love this DR. He listens. Thats the best thing I can say. He listens and is part of the community time, family, and $$$.
1	The doctor himself is rather "blah."  It's the office staff that makes this place so awful.
5	Dr. Day is awesome; knowledgable, friendly, and he's  GREAT with my kids! He makes a balloon animal with a rubber glove, they love it. The staff is just as nice. I wouldn't go anywhere else.
