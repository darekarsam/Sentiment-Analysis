4	Oh taco bell, I know it's bad for me but I want it and just cannot control myself when it comes to salty, high calorie perhaps not 100% beef goodness Taco Bell is where I indulge on fast food. This structure was previously a BP gas station that was converted into a Taco Bell. The inside is still convenience store sized I think there are less then ten tables in this location, and there are awkward high tops in he middle of the dinning area.   With that being said I think it would be best to take your food to go.  Any who the tacos are good here and so are the Mexican pizza and bonus Taco Bell has all you can drink fountain drinks, which I am sure you are all aware of.
4	I've always had fast service and hot food. Also, I've come to conclusion that they went through a great & lengthy customer service training. This is the friendliest bunch that I've ever seen :) Thumbs up guys!
1	Taco Bell has blown it with this new "Dollar Cravings Menu" The items on it are just rehashed versions of things that were already on the menu for cheaper prices. Not to mention the sizes are half the size of the original product.
2	Service is very slow. Every time I go there they are "out of" 4 out of the 5 things I came there to order. Points for my order actually being correct, most other taco bell locations cannot manage even that.
