5	I was looking for a new business bank for my small business.  My wife found Comerica Bank by reading the rave reviews online.  I went into the Central and Osborn location and was blown away by their amazing customer service. I had just transitioned my business from a corporation to a Sole Proprietor and was having problems getting the proper paperwork.  They spent almost 2 hours with me helping me get the proper paperwork to open an account.   I have never written a review but the help and expertise this bank and their staff showed me-I had to share my amazing experience. Based upon my experience I am also moving over my household personal accounts to this bank as well. I highly Comerica Bank and especially the brank at Central and Osborn.

1	Would NOT use this bank.  Unknowledgeable banker didn't know her own products.Was a waste of time!Wells Fargo I am staying with you!
5	I love this bank! They are like family at this point and I have cancelled my Chase bank account. I do ally banking at this location and they know me by name. You can't get that kind of service at the larger banks.
