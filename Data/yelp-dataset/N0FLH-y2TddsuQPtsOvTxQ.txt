5	It's Roller Derby, in Charlotte, with a large, loud fan base, monthly matches, and really rad gear (as in, for us fans - my fav has got to be the purple foam devil horns). Hot (flexible! fast!) ladies on skates, in tight skirts/pants/fishnets, pizza (by Fuel) and beer available for reasonable prices, and a scary clown MC man. Awesome way to spend 10 bucks and a couple hours one Sunday (sometimes Saturday) a month.
5	Charlotte Roller Girls - Instant party. Fun girls on wheels, going fast, knocking each other around.  Plenty of beer.  Why isn't everyone going to these fun games?  Honestly, something wholesome for the family.  A good postive message for kids and booze for the adults.  Let us pray.
5	Need to find some grrrls that will talk derby to you while cracking a PBR or six?  Look no further.  The Charlotte Roller girls are Charlotte's battered and bruised, wild and tattood, newest athletic team.  Don't know anything about roller derby?  Who cares.  You'll learn as they explain the basics at each match.  Cheap beer + $10 tickets + rad ladies = A great SundayFYI:  Bring a few extra bucks...you'll probably want some merch after you learn how fun this is.
5	Tickets are just $10 in advance and you can get two beers for $7. They also have Mellow Mushroom Pizza. The games are full of hard hitting action between two teams of hard-core female athletes and plenty of fun activities for the kids.
5	Roller derby is awesome! Save $ by getting advance tickets at the register at Common Market or Sleepy Poet. There is also free food and drinks at tailgating in the parking lot before the game. Free bike valet also. beer + hard-hitting derby = fun... and for cheap!
