3	This is one of the more run down Wine in Spirits in all of the city.  I only go to this Wine and Spirits sparingly, it's that bad.  The store is tiny and cramped and the wine selection is almost nonexistent.
3	This W&S can be decent or sub-par. It all depends on what you're looking for. We often stop in on our way to some of the BYOB restaurants in the North Side to pick up a reasonably-priced, but decent bottle of wine. For that purpose, this location is gets the job done.If you're in search of a unique wine or chairman's selection, though, you're going to be highly disappointed. If you're looking for good whiskey/scotch, on the other hand, you'll be surprised at their nice little selection.The store is very small and the selection is limited, but the the staff - including the security guy that's always there - is super nice and helpful. If I still lived in the North Side, I'd have no issues with this location being my go-to W&S, but if you're looking to stock your wine cabinet with anything unique, you'll be better off at some of the larger locations.
3	Had a good selection, plus our beloved Bota Box was for sale. Local drunk included.
2	This has to be one of the smallest Wine and Spirits stores in the city. This place doesn't even compare to the one in Shadyside. The wine selection is decent for the size, and the people behind the counter are always pretty nice. It's a decent place to stop in if you're in a hurry and in the area, but otherwise I would recommend going somewhere else for your liquor and wine needs.
