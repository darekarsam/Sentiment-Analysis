4	My kids and I decided to go out of town last minute to see if the last round of Supercross. So I went looking for tickets online and found StubHub. I was able to find the tickets that we wanted at a reasonable price. So we packed up the truck and took the four and a half hour drive to Las Vegas and picked up the tickets at the local StubHub office located on Dean Martin Drive just across the highway from Caesars Palace. It was surprisingly easy to pick up the tickets. It's a little hard to find because the address that they print on their website is not 100 percent accurate. If at all possible print your tickets from your home or from your office instead of choosing to pick him up from the StubHub office in Las Vegas. It'll save you 20 to 30 minutes.
1	These guys really hosed me on book of mormon tix, always go through the venue. Thomas on the phone was 13 & needs some work on his social skills. Beware of stubhub. I should've listened to friends but I wanted those tickets I learned the hard way, I want to save anyone else from a similar situation.
1	I heartily agree with Whitney H.  Stubhub is a ripoff.  I paid $150 for a $32 Trans-Siberian Orchestra ticket.  This is "reasonable," Anthony Z.?  Stubhub promotes usury.  I will never use them again.  Also beware of Steve Jana, the seller.
