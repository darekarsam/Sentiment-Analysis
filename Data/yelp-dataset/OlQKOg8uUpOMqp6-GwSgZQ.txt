4	Super atmosphere. Try the crab cakes! Deelicious. Menu seems a bit scattered - but they just opened. Very nice ambience.
5	Service: the waitress was clearly knowledgable of the entire menu and was friendly and kind. The food was delicious. I had a burger and it was one of the best burgers I have had in a looooong time. The curry cawliflower soup was fantastic. They know what they are doing there. A+
