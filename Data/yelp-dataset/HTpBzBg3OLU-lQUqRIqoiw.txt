4	This Chili's isn't a lot different than the one on Mill.  However, not being on Mill does have its advantages with not being full of college kids all the time.  The service is pretty good and it's crowded all that often.  You can have a quiet dinner here more than at the one on Mill.  Pretty good Chili's here.
3	Let me explain the 3 stars. I know the place is corporate, mundane and not all that exciting. However, when I first decided that I would be moving to Tempe it was inside this Chili's. That was more than a decade ago, but I know that I made the right decision in moving here.The food at Chili's is worth 2 stars. The ambiance, maybe 2 as well. But at least mill ave is walking distance afterwards. The location of this Chili's is pretty good. But there are much better places to eat in the surrounding neighborhood.
