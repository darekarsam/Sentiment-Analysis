3	$2.75/shirt after a $.75/shirt coupon.  Ouch.  I miss bigger city life when it comes to this!
2	This cleaners does a good job, but watch out! It's EXPENSIVE!Of course, you don't find this out until you get your bill. There is no price list in the store. I recently took 4 items to be cleaned and had a coupon for $6 off from the company's website. My total was still more than $40 after they coupon. A dress costs $14.38 to clean according to my receipt. I'm not talking about formal dresses that require special care, I took 2 basic dresses, one of which is polyester and doesn't even need to be pressed. I also took 2 pairs of pants which were about $8 each.I will never patronize this business again.
1	This place is terrible.  My husband and I had a jacket, shirt, and dress dry cleaned and it was somehow $60.  My husband asked what it would cost beforehand and they seemed to have no idea.  And the small stain on his shirt remains.  Don't waste your time.  We used to live in Chicago and so had better options, but will be trying other places and not coming back.
