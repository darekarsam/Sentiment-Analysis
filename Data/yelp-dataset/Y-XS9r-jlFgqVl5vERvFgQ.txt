5	Penny is amazing. I've loved getting treats from her at the Fresh52 market. I love her treats so much I asked her to make a grooms cake for my wedding this weekend. It was perfect. I told her my idea and she created something perfect! Thank you Penny for helping make our day a little extra special!
5	Penny is so prompt and get right back to you. It's near impossible to find a bakery that is nut free so when I found her I knew it was worth a shot. She delivered them to our hotel on time and the cookies were the best oatmeal raisin cookies we've ever had! Ordered the strawberry strawberry cupcakes. They were tasty. Thank you Penny!. We will definitely order from you again in August when we return to LV.
5	Wow, just had a Birthday party for my kids. I ordered a Minecraft cake and was very impressed! The cake looked fantastic, decorations, minecraft squares, characters, taste, simply everything was perfect. My 8 and 9 year old were so happy with the cake. Guests loved it too. Thank you Peny for making my party awesome. Great Job!
