1	I just called this place they have a year restriction on what year your RV is. She wanted to know what year my RV is, I don't care if they were to give me a spot for free, I would not stay there. The lady didn't seem too happy that I have a 2005 Class-C RV.
4	I'm actually really surprised by all the negativity this place has received. Is this the Taj Mahal of RV parks? Not at all. Do you get exactly what they state you will? Yes! What did you expect for $150/week?!?!  This is the second time we have stayed at Road Runner in our 33' coach. We have never had any issues. This is not an on-strip location and does not claim to be. It is, for the most part, a quiet park that is out of the way.I have dealt with 2 ladies at the front desk and both of them were incredibly kind. One reviewer was offended by being asked what year their RV was. Well, in the 2 years I have been full time in my coach, almost every park asks this. Get over it. If that is all it takes to offend you, it is probably rather difficult to please you.Bottom line...we saw no sketchy behavior inside the park. We saw security patrolling every night. If you are an intelligent, able-bodied adult, you should have no issues.
