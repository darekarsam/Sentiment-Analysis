4	This place just opened near the 7-11 and Vincent's on Camelback so I had to stop in and see what the new concept from Fox Restaurant Concepts would be.  It is all about the juice, cold-pressed, old-school, with that new school price. There are a few snacks, veggie trays, to-go salads, sandwiches and cookies available.  I like the look and feel, minimalist with appropriate signage.  If I were doing a detox cleanse, then I might consider these juices for meal replacements.  Otherwise, the price tag is steeper than Whole Foods for the same product of juice.  I've tried Kaleidoscope Juice in Scottsdale and Juicd Life at the Biltmore in the past.  Those reviews will be posted soon.  Any cold-pressed juice in the Phoenix Metro area is going to be pricey, it takes more time and  more veggies than you can imagine to make the 16 oz. portions that we enjoy.With that said, I will revisit Juby True again, not sure of the frequency though.
2	I had a smoothie that was pretty good on Wednesday during grand opening. I am a smoothie snob. This was one of the better ones I have had. That being said I got a little 10 Oz portion (only one size) and it cost $9. this was one of the bigger ripoffs I have experienced in 2014 despite being satisfied with my one minute of drinking it. It would be 4.5 stars for the product and it gets dropped to 1.5 for the portion size and price. Service good. Nice people behind counter.
