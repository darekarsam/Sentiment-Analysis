4	Glad Andy opened up here in the Walmart in Belmont.  I had tried them all but could not find a nail place that I liked.  Everyone is great here.  They have a menu of options for different types of services like a hot stoe pedicure, Gel nails, gel nail polich manicures.  I have my nails done by Billy and have been very happy.
1	Don't waste your time.  These people are so rude!!!  Me and a friend just left there after waiting 20 minutes to get a pedicure.  When I finally asked them how much longer, we were told they couldn't do it tonight.  We got there at 6pm.  They close at 7:30.   Will never go back!  So nasty and rude to us!!!
3	Just okay....sometime service is good sometimes not so much...never great!!! Can't beat the $ if looking for a deal & short on time.
