5	This was the best dining experience I have had during two trips to Montreal, having eaten out every night. The atmosphere is charming...you feel as though you've been transported to the countryside, to a well-appointed  barn house, overlooking a lake. I had the seafood platter and a salad. The platter contained several different types of shellfish, etc. and had a lovely, light seasoning. The service was both attentive and unobtrusive. The prices seem steep but the value for those dollars is well worth it.
4	The food and service are outstanding. The ambiance is that of a large old farm house and very cozy. I highly recommend this restaurant for an excellent non-pretentious experience.

4	The food here is pretty good.  I've had a few different meals here and I've really enjoyed them. I had fish, sweet breads, and my most recent was rabbit. All have been delicious!What I actually love this place is the lemon (or lime) palette cleanser after the appetizer course. If you like french cuisine, I would recommend this restaurant, especially if you live in the West Island. Although it's a little expensive and the wines are over-priced (what else is new), its still a good bet. I would say the wine list is a little on the low end of overpriced wine, and their selection is pretty good.
