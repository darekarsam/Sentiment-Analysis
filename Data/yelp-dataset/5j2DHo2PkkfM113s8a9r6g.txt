4	De bons choix et de bons plats. Bonne ambiance.
5	This place is awesome!  Everything on the menu is delicious.  My favorite is the Salmon Tartare, but all of their tapas are just as scrumptious! Nice, understated decor and good smooth ambiance with super nice and curteous staff.  I'm thrilled this place is just a hop and a skip away from my house, makes it easier to keep coming back.
1	The lobster and bacon macpoutine (poutine week) was terribly bad; absolutely no lobster nor bacon taste, and no sauce!... Wasn' t even a poutine! There were plenty of empty tables (counted 4+) but we were told all were reserved so we decided to order to go, but there's not even room to stand.
3	My friends gave me great reviews about this place, and I really enjoy tapas, so I was looking forward to try out their menu. We went there for one my friend's birthday, and they were nice enough to keep the cake I brought in the fridge. It's a rather small place, but the ambiance is nice, the staff is friendly and I enjoyed the music.We ordered a bunch of tapas. My favorites would be the the classic salmon tartar (la betise) and the fish tacos. I really enjoyed the tartar la betise, and the taste reminded me of spicy salmon sushi. I think I would have enjoyed more if instead of deep-fried chips, they were served with nori. I was looking forward to try their octopus salad, but they were out. Other than that, I found that the other meals were ok.As for the service, it was a bit weird. We got our tapas at various moments instead of all together, and since we were all sharing, it made us wait for the rest of the plates to come. Also, our bills were mixed up and took time to come. Price wise, if you split the bill other peeps, you can probably get of taste of 8-10 plates for around 35$, which is good.Overall, it is a nice place, and I probably would go again, but in a smaller group for better service.
