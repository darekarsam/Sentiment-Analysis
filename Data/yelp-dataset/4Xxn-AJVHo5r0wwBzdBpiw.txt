3	I've already been here twice. I had a platter of fruits which doesn't qualify as food to write a review for. Today though I had a buckwheat crepe which was sublime. You really need to try it. On the side the salad was completely "not interesting". However I lost interest for it immediately after I tasted the crepe. The service was ok and I agree with most of the reviewers that its kind of expensive.
4	Great place very hip, clean and nice decor.  Very nice people food is very healthy and good.  I would definitely refer it to friends.
1	Ordered a chocolate banana crepe thinking its pretty hard to screw that up you know, but they found a way. It was cold, dry, and just very badly executed. The service was also not the best, never came by to see how it was or even refill our drinks. Safe to say I would not recommend this place to a friend.
4	A great place for breakfast if you're in the neighborhood.  I had a perfect grilled cheese sandwich with caramelized onions, basil sausage.  It came with roasted potatoes and some fruit.  Excellent brewed coffee! and service.
4	Excellent Brunch/breakfast.  The grilled cheese with apples and duck confit was outstanding.  Very creative combinations.  The space is noisy and vibrant with hipsters of all ages. Nice cafe au lait. Will definitely return to sample more of the menu.
4	I enjoyed my meal here. The coffee was excellent, the service was good. I ordered  a Duck Confit grilled cheese sandwich with slices of apple and it was pretty awesome. Very filling I saved the other half for later.Would return.
3	I ordered the ricotta crepe with spinach, pancetta and cheddar. It was moist and delicious. I also had a side salad. The dressing was garlicky and delicious but the lettuce was wilted, which I believe should never be served. My boyfriend had the grilled chicken sandwich. It was very very dry. His accompanying soup, however was good.The service was good. The ambiance, good.Price was entirely average.
