4	I had to write some praise for Cox cable. I get my internet and digital phone through them. I started having problems with the modem re-setting and knocking me off the internet or cutting off the phone. I emailed their support. They responded quick with a few questions then monitored my signal for a day. Within two days they had a tech sent out to look at it. It was a bit late in the day so they decided to return the next day and replace the modem as a first try. They said they would monitor it for a week. Problem kept happening. Tech returned on his own, found another person with the problem on the street so he replaced some parts further up the line. He came to our door to let us know he thinks he fixed it and would continue to monitor just in case. All seems well now. The original online support person also checked in again to see if it was fixed.I've heard nightmare stories about techs never figuring out problems but they managed to figure ours out pretty quick and were very friendly.
1	38 minute wait on the phone.  No straight answers.  No regards to customer service.  I actually cancelled and broke my rate guarantee with them and paid a 120$ early termination fee due to the customer service I received.  **edit** here's also something funny.  I asked where to return the HD receiver and she said "I am sorry my Internet is down right now and I don't know where the closest store is to you."  An Internet company can't even keep their employees Internet on...... IronyPro tip:Choose any other service
2	I have spent nearly a total of 7 nights and over 5 hrs with different people trying to resolve connectivity issues. Every different person suggests something else to be done including upgrading speed and purchasing diff modems. The service breaks up and is intermittent. Too bad they are the better of the rest of the providers.
