3	We spent an unexpected night in Charlotte and had to walk here from the Embassy Suites to pick up some toiletries because the Embassy Suites store SUCKED.  I guess that should probably be mentioned on another review.  Well aside from the fact that there are apparently no sidewalks in Charlotte, this CVS is well stocked with your standard drugstore stuff.  Their travel size department was a bit lacking, and the checkout was slow, but all in all if you need toothpaste, or a pair of cheap sandals these guys have it.
3	Ah, CVS...the new go-to place for prescriptions since Walgreens couldn't work it out with my insurance plan to keep covering my drug needs. The employees are nice and work fast. But the ambiance of the store lacks interest or appeal. Leave a few wrappers on the floor and the entire store feels trashy. After noticing some trash on the floor I suddenly felt like I needed to cover myself in hand sanitizer...Anyway, this location is convenient. Since I don't shop her on a regular basis I found that the prices seemed a bit pricer than say, Target. If you're in a pinch, they have everything to get by on...but if you want to pinch a penny, go elsewhere.
3	Oh CVS, I always end up leaving here with some super random item that I see and then for some strange reason feel like I must have. Last night, it was a Santa drink cup with a snow globe in it. Everyone needs one of those... right?This is my new pharmacy now that I live over by this 'hood. The workers here are nice. There's a super friendly floor person who loves to help everyone. Such a happy guy. The pharmacy is kind of slow at times... even when it's not all that busy.One problem with this CVS is the location and the accessibility. It's a pain in the arse to get in and out of this place. If you're coming down Woodlawn from Park Road, I recommend turning at the South Blvd light.. and coming in by the Arby's. If you can't find what you need here, there's a Walgreens on the next block.
