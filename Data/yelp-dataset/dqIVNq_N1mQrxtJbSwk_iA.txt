5	Very friendly lady that works there. Good clean place.
1	Despite the name, you can't use coins here. Everything is operated with a special cash card you must buy on site and you can only pay for with bills. No coins, no debit or credit cards, just bills. If I had actually been able to use any of the machines I might have been able to leave a better review. The place is very clean and attended with machines that appear to be very well maintained.
3	I remember when this place had just cards. I don't use cards anymore. I take cash for my load of laundry. They usually have it done in an hour or two. I do the fluff and fold for $1.25 a lb. I have had no problems with this place so far.The only problem I did run across was a female attendant who wanted me to give Her some Lortab. I am not a drug dealer of course, so no deal. Now they have different attendants. They do a good job for me. It is close and when I go in the am there is hardly anyone there. That is my review so far. I may add more later.
1	It's called "Las Vegas coin laundry" but it's a lie like most things in Vegas. They require a card to load $ onto with a $5 min to start so if you're like me who's passing thru and only has $3 worth of laundry you are donating the left over cash. No coins accepted at the coin op. Typical Vegas BS. If it were exceptionally clean and pleasant to be here I wouldn't complain but it's just your average dive laundry mat with less conscience.
