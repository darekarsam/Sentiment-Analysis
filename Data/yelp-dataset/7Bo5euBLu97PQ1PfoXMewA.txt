5	Not just a burger a Dic Ann burger. If you want a out of this world burger  you have to try it to believe it.
3	Loses a star because of the location, but this is a swell burger, in a retro-vintage back to the eighties kind of way.The menu is very limited, burgers with 3-variations, and a hot-dog.No chicken, no dessert, one size of drink.There's not much better in this part of Laval
3	Dic Ann's was an acquired taste for me. I didn't really think much about it the first time I went, but since I'm associated with other people that love this place, I've found myself back at this joint and enjoying it more and more each time.The first time I went, I went with a basic hamburger. Like four basic hamburgers (they're not that filling, I swear!). It had a unique sauce (with a kick!) and pretty good meat patty. The bun is squished down to the width of a pancake and then held together with a toothpick. The hi-boys, as they call it, is a patty with cheese, tomato and lettuce. These are actually much better than the plain burger and is much more filling (I only need three!). All in all, this is a unique burger. I don't hold it in as high regard as others do, but nevertheless it's good stuff. Inexpensive too.
