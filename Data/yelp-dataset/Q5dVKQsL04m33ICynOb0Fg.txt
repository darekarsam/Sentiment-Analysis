3	This place is a Franchise and everyone of them are pretty ok for the price. The whole point with that restaurant is to get something to eat ASAP for your 30 minutes lunch break. I like the General Thai (which is a version of General Tao). There is plenty of chicken, rice is well cooked and sticky and the sauce is pretty good too. The way i see it his in 30 minutes, in that joint of the city, you have very few choice and this one will get you filled up for 10$ max! The Spring Roll are ok too. Pretty cheap and massive (maybe a little too massive; tough to eat it properly).They take interact and credit card.  I'd rather eat there then Mcdonald.
2	they did not take my visa which is a culture shock for me. most businesses in the u.s. do if they take credit card. food's pretty good but i feel like i paid $7 for more rice than red tofu curry. if my bike were here i wouldn't care but a little annoyed especially since i just discovered it's a franchise. still the service was fast and the cashier made sure i was ok.
1	Oh dear lord...what an abomination! I wasn't expecting Bangkok's finest here, but this is a chain that we have in Vancouver and I've always been able to count on it for a decent, quick food court meal. But this place is NOTHING like the Thai Express back home.I ordered the green curry chicken. The guy wok'd it for all of 3 seconds before dumping a bizarrely thick, cornstarch-heavy sauce on top. It possessed none of the balance imperative to actual Thai cuisine, and was simply all heat. I would be very surprised if there was any coconut milk, fish sauce or kaffir leaves used at all.My husband's pad thai was an oil slick, and the noodles were all wrong.We took a couple bites and left. Awful, awful, awful...considering letting the Thai Express folks know what this particular franchise is doing to their good name.
