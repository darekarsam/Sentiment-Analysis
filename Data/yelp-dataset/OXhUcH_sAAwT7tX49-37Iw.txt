5	Placed a large order here to feed some hungry airmen/women and had no complaints. The order was accurate and each pizza had the normal amount of toppings (sometimes you'll get shorted on cheese, sauce, etc when ordering multiple pizzas. Which didn't happen here).  If you're ever on Nellis AFB and want pizza check them out!
4	Order was right exactly what I asked for and did all online! I was surprised at the late hours on base normally food establishment close at 8. Only down side on line wouldn't allow me to make my order delivery. Had to drive to pick up! They also don't offer as much in there special offers as other stores in the city do.
3	This place is delicious but way over priced. Personal pizza is $8! A personal pizza with soda and bread sticks. .. $8! Seriously?
