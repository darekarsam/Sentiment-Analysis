5	I took my national boards for optometry part 3 here and despite my fears of having difficult to navigate in this building, I found it quite easy to to figure out. Although there are many entrances, the one that is on S. College street is the easiest to access and the security guards are very active in making sure that you are not lost. As soon as you press the button to get in (if the building is locked), they will respond on the intercom and a person will come out to greet you and open the door for you. Then they also direct you to the right elevators. Overall, I find the building easy to access and the employees in there nice and helpful and the view from the 20th floor relaxing. Although the water from the drinking fountain tasted a bit strange.
