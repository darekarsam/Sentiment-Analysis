4	Great selection of cocktails prepared with expertise.  Vegas-like feel to the bar.  Illuminated bar with a fallen leaf pattern to it.  Funky.  Music is perfect - not too loud to kill the possibility of conversation, but loud enough to feel like a club.Lofted from the main lobby of the hotel, but tucked back enough not to notice.  Reasonable prices considering their location.  Well worth a visit.
5	I've ended many a night here, and it always feels like I'm coming home. Great drinks, with an exceptional vibe.The Plateau is interesting, as it can sometimes be a calm and quiet bar in the early afternoon or late evening, allowing for quiet conversation on one of the low divans, or it can be a jumping party.  Duane, the manager for the W's nightlife, manages to pull in some exceptional DJs and surprise guests (i.e. a private secret John Legend afterparty performance when he was playing in Montreal), making coming here a fantastic crapshoot.  If you truly want to be a high-roller, bring a group and rent out the amazing location at the top of the steps with a group and bottle service, which I had the singular experience of doing for NYE one year.Even if you just come in for a quiet drink, the staff will be glad to have a chat with you and make you feel more than welcome.  If I lived in Montreal, this would be my local lounge and I wouldn't change a thing about it.
