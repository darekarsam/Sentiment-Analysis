3	This is your basic mall fast food Chinese place. Don't expect anything more than that. That's why it's 3 stars. It's good for what it is, but it's pretty  much what you'd get at other Panda locations. The thing that struck me about this little food court counter is what you can't see from the front. I used to work doing refrigeration and commercial appliance repair in the area. This particular Panda location always had the cleanest and best maintained kitchen I've seen in the CU area, and I've been in a lot of them. Color me impressed.
5	Food was great, generous portions, they piled on the entrees, despite the to go box already pretty full. Good to see. Didn't see any old lady maybe that's why.
4	I decided to try Panda Express at the mall this time over the other fast food Chinese places.  What struck me was they slice the chicken breast in front of you so you know you are not getting chopped up pieces of whatever which has always disturbed me about the other places.  They also cooked the vegetables up fresh for you.  The flavor was really good for the price and I thought the portion was just right.  I was able to have a fulfilling meal and take some home for later.  I liked the Teriyaki sauce on the side too so you can regulate how much you want on your food.
2	Not "Chinese food".Just same things fried in same sauce.Will never go unless Iam stuck in the mall and hungry
