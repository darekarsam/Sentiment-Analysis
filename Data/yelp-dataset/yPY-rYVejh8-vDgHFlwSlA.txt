5	I just love it when I can ask a million game-player geek questions and get some quality feedback from fellow 'geeks' haha.  But seriously, the service was excellent, and the trade in ratio to in-store credit was fare.  The store was clean, easy to navigate, and the customer service was outstanding!So often I find myself buying games I play once or twice and then they collect dust.  Here, I was able to ask a dozen questions and narrow down some great game choices.
2	I pre-ordered 2 Pokemon games. Each game comes with a Pokemon figure for the pre-order. Went to pick them up the day it was released and they wouldn't give me the figures because they were not given enough from the supplier. WTH? Tell that to my 10 year old. They told me to call back in a few days since they never have 100% pick up and they were only giving them to the people that order on the 1st day of the pre-order. If this happens all the time they should tell you at pre-order. Called tonight no extra figurines and the games are in stock.
3	Same price for games that you will pay anywhere else, usually has game bonus offered with the big game releases. I dont like the fact that they only offer you like $9 or less on a game that costed $60. I remember when Nintendo game use to cost $19.99, I just keep the games rather than trade them in so I dont feel like I got slapped in the face.
