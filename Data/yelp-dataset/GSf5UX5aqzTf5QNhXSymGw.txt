1	Horrible! The girl at the desk was sleeping and the Staff was rude.It's crazy that someone  who just had major back surgery must wait 3-5 hours in PAIN to be seen. Just because the Drug reps bring you lunch does not make it acceptable to have your patients wait while you eat! Horrible bed side manner!!
5	I love Dr. Ghuman and his staff. He takes time to listen to you and your concerns. When you make a treatment goal, he does everything in his power to meet or even exceed those goals. He takes care of every patient that walks through his doors.  It's a drive, but a drive well worth it.  I'd send anyone who has had back pain or who suffers from headaches to this office.
5	Dr. Ghuman is so awesome. This office is so nice as well as the entire staff! A beautiful office and very peaceful. Just a long drive for me but well worth the drive. I trust Dr. Ghuman with my life and that of my father's!!! Dr. Ghuman is so good with Seniors. I highly recommend him for he is one of the most compassionate Doctor's I have ever met!
