1	This is absolutely the worst experience! They charge for dry cleaning but launder the clothes and overcharge you until you catch it. Then expect you to bring all your clothes back to do them over instead of refunding the difference. GO ANYWHERE BUT HERE!
1	Went here to get my comforter cleaned. When I got it back I noticed many burn marks all over it. Avoid this place
1	Took my shoes to get fixed, did not get them back for almost a month because they couldn't find them as they do repairs at a different location. "Boss" was no where to be found and even when I was able to get my shoes back, they weren't even fixed. Its a terrible place doing shady business
