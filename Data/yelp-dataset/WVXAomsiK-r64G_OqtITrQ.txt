4	Only reason it loses a star is because it's small for a saturday night when the whole room is packed but this is a great place you get treated like family awesome bar mixed drinks arn't their favorite but don't complain if you ask for it and it's not right when they prob never make mixed drinks they are good though. Price beats almost everyone! Bar it self beats every bar in area!
1	The lady bartender   who sounded like a man, appeared to be drunk and had an attitude.. All I wanted to know is if I paid her for both drinks.. She said really. Hymned and Hawed irritated she had to look for my tab. She kept saying her whole family are red heads and they are nothing.. She was the manliest rudest female I've encountered.Not going back ever....BTW I was right. She only.charge me for one drink..I knew it! Ha
1	Been living here for many years.   Sports bar with betting, usually fun but since proximity to ghetto can become unpredictably dangerous even though staff tries their best. Owner cane in and yelled at his staff infringement of patrons. . Kind of unprofessional but it is a kind of a dive.  Not for family or dates.
