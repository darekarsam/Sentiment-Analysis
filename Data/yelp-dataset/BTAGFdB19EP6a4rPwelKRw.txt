5	I signed up for Yelp specifically to write a review about the incredible experience that I had with Dynojet in Las Vegas!!  Dusty and Chuck really know their stuff over there and I greatly appreciate the service and quick turn around time that I had with them working on my bike!  If you are in the market for a Power Commander or engine modifications, these guys are definitely who you should take your bikes and vehicles to.
5	Unbelievable service by staff that will go beyond the call of duty....! Thanks to Chuck and Dustin for looking after our bikes!!!
5	Wow, what a class act from all employees. Not only do they have a world class (and leading) product, they have the staff and knowhow to back everything up. There is a reason Dynojet is the #1 company in it's field of racing products.I was taken care of by Chris in the dyno room. He was able to map my power commander in a timely and quality manner. His tuning resulted in a maximum horsepower gain of over 10%! This is huge! I will never use a different product or service on my motorcycle.
