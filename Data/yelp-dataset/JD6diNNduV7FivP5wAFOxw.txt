4	We had them do the master closet in our new American West home. It came out fantastic and the best part is that my wife and I had no disagreements in regards to closet space as we got to design the closet to both our needs. It most definitely made our moving in experience a lot easier.
5	My wife and I came into the location and were greeted immediately with a smile by Joe Ferraro. He made us feel both welcomed and comfortable.  He helped us design the perfect closet right on the spot. I highly recommend Joe and closets Las Vegas for all your home closet designs. Thanks Joe!
5	While out of town the shelving in my craft room fell down, what a mess. We went to Closets Las Vegas and Joe F. Made us feel like we were his most important customers even though our project was very small. We were extremely satisfied with the whole experience. The closet looks great..we would very highly recommend Joe, Closets Las Vegas to anyone
