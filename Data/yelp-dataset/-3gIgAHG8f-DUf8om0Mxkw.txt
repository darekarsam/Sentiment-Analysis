4	Chances are Gorgie Cobblers have been around on Gorgie Road for as long as Gorgie Road has been in Gorgie. A fixture on the street, always calm and friendly, knowledgable about their trades and a straightforward approach to their customers. I've returned a fair few times and always been well looked, after as have my shoes (more importantly).
