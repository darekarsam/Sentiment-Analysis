5	This is one of my go to places in the market, I can't believe it's slipped through my Yelping fingers for so long! If you are visiting the market this is a delicious option for lunch, it's just a tiny counter with a ton of homemade sausages but they are always grilling some of their best and you can get them loaded up with kraut and hot peppers and mustards and a lovely toasted bun to walk around with, or park yourself on a stoop or picnic bench in the sun to people watch and enjoy the many live musicians who busk here. If you are preparing a BBQ make this a stop for sure - these are exceptional big fat tasty sausages of all kinds and flavours. I like the jalapeno and cheese and the beer sausage and you know, pretty much all of them.
