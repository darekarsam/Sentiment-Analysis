5	Professional..Punctual..FriendlyWe have been using D&D for almost a year at the salon I manage.  We have a weekly service from them and they are always on time and do a fantastic job!!!  They are friendly and fun, which is an added bonus.
5	Dena & David have been cleaning my house weekly for about a year now, and I appreciate their great work and prices as well as their flexibility. I am a graduate student with a busy schedule and a tight budget, and I've found their service well worth the very reasonable cost. I love having a clean house, and before enlisting their services, it was rarely as clean as I would have liked. Earlier this summer, they did extra cleaning (cleaning the upholstery on my living room furniture) for no charge as a thanks for my being a regular customer.Full disclosure: I was offered one free cleaning for writing a review, but the opinions above are absolutely my own. Indeed, offers like this are one of the things that I like so much about their service, and I would not have written the review if I didn't have only nice things to say. :)
