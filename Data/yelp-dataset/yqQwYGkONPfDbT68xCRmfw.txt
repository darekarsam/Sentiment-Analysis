3	This establishment is pretty new to The Ivy and  I kept seeing signs for it so I was stoked to try it as a sucker for Chinese food.  Each time I see the sign, I start singing Kings of Leon "Sex on Fire" but "Yeaaaaaaaaaah, this WOK is on fiiiiiiire" They had a pretty nice setup inside with a spacious seating area. I wasn't expecting that as I thought it was a take out only kind of place but it was roomy with nice decor. My friend and I ordered at the same time and we both got the General Tso's Lunch Special (which lunch specials comes with a free drink, rice and spring roll) but only one came out. So we waited for mine. And waited.....and waited. I got up when I saw a waitress coming by (it's one of those joints where you order in the front and they give you a number and bring to you) and I said "Excuse me" and she looked at me and walked away. Ok???   I am not a quiet girl so that annoyed me as she must have heard me so I went right to the front and found the manager who alleviated the situation right away and got me my General Tso's. He was very nice and helpful so it was nice to see my situation taken care of right away and later came back to make sure everything was ok.The Tso's was good but not the best I've ever had (could have had more spice as it was pretty mild).  I would go there if I wanted a quick (well hopefully next time it would be quick) fix for Chinese when I am work but don't think I will be saying "Oh, I need some Wok on Fire stat" anytime soon. From working in the restaurant business for a number of years, I appreciated the good service and concern from the manager so that added some brownie points for them in my book.
4	New and...I liked it! It's located on the second floor of the Ivy, just across the street from the Blumenthal Theater. If you come in from Tryon, you'll walk up a narrow stairwell and come in facing the bar. If you come in from the main Ivy's building, I am pretty sure you can find an elevator to get in. The service was very friendly and attentive. There is plenty of seating and I've got to say, if you are into people watching, this is a nice set up. The decor is classy and room for lots of people. Sitting on the second floor, windows line the dining area. We ordered the veggie lo mein and the General Tso's chicken. They came out promptly and fresh. Both portions were large and really enough to share if you weren't hungry for your own plate. Try it next time you are in Uptown. Most of the dishes for dinner are just under $10. Their menu also states that they can deliver.
2	Went here for the first time in my never ending quest for good Chinese food in the CLT.  For fast food Chinese, it was ok.  I had the sesame chicken which was covered in too much sauce which is common for Chinese restaurants.  Food was ok, but my initial impression was that it's a pretty common fast food Chinese place.  Price is very good to average, you can get lunch specials from $7 with the drink included.  Decor is nice, the main selling point to come here is that the restaurant has windows that overlook Tryon Street.I would go back to try out some of the other dishes to confirm my review, but there are better places to go in CLT.
5	**Gem Alert**  I am always on the look for spots like this.  The secret restaurant/bar spots that nobody knows about.  My goal: To make people aware of this place so that it stays open and busy.  As you can tell, I love this place. Don't be fooled by the entrance.  You have to trust me and take that leap of faith up the secret corridor of stairs.  The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor and has such a wonderful view of Tryon St. and the Performing Arts Center.  You can relax in a modern Asian/American style ambiance while taking in the busiest part of the city.  Everything is brand new and the bar sports some real sweet flat screens. Now the food... We ordered the lettuce wraps and crab fon doo thingy (fried crab wonton thing). Wow! One more time... Wow!  Real nice size portions and they hit the spot perfectly.  You have multiple spice options: X1, X2, X3, and Death.. Haha.  We did X1 and it was very mild.  Which is just the way my Wife likes it.  They have a great selection of beers on draft and one that is always $2.  Strike up a conversation with the Andys.  Andy and Andy are extremely friendly and they really take care of you.  Great late night atmosphere as well as any lunch/dinner time.  Trust me on this one peoples.  Stop by THE WOK!!  Enjoy! -Ian M.

The staff/management are vivacious and knowledgeable.  And honestly, you cannot over-value a good bartender and they have a true professional behind the bar.  Richard, not only, knows his drinks, but he entertains you with his bartending skills and good conversation.  If you get a chance, you gotta meet the manager, Dan.  Extremely friendly and he has this place going in such an exciting direction.  They all truly prioritize the customer's needs above all and that makes everything else even better.  Trust me on this one peoples.  Stop by THE WOK!!  Enjoy!-Ian M.
5	Went there last night for their official grand opening and it was a home run.  Drinks were good, food was great, staff was friendly and fast, and entertainment was great (they had a few local comedians).  You can people watch from the window cause this place in on the second floor.  I will be back for sure.
4	The Wok bar is great, the employees are really friendly, the food is priced right and they have a great selection of beers. I was there last night and found out they have live music and once a month, a beer tasting.  They offered complimentary tacos which were very good albeit not mexican, my favorite was the spicy beef but the pork and chicken were tasty as well.They had beer specials that were very reasonable for any establishment in any part of the city but amazing for uptown. I love the foreign feel of it as it is hidden upstairs, so you have a bird's eye view of Tryon. I will definetly be back, next time I will bring my POSSE.
3	Just stopped in to get some lunch takeout today - the Mongolian Beef was pleasant, a little mild for my taste. The serving size was very skimpy for $9, though. And despite the little teenage girl's promise that the package contained "4 or 5 packs of Soy sauce", not only were there none, but not even chopsticks or plasticware.Have increased food costs pushed even Chinese food over the threshold of "if you want it done right and for reasonable value, make it at home"?Three stars may be generous, but I'm a generous guy...
2	I must update this review.. This place is on the way out.. It went from 5 stars to 2!!! The managers and the best bartender have bailed and their service has gone to *beep*.   I knew they were trying to change into more of a bar than a restaurant but come on guys.. I have ordered the lettuce wraps multiple times here and they have always been excellent.  They brought out medium size raggity old spinach leaves and lower quality cold beef.. Twice..  Ughhh.. Im so disappointed.  Especially because it is in such a good location. Sorry guys. It actually pains me to write this.  I was waiting weeks to write this and gave it multiple second chances.. I even got ROTD for my 5 star review of this place.. Ugh!-Ian M.
2	Previous reviews for the Wok Bar are all over the place, and so is the service.  From what we could learn by talking to the staff, the current GM has only been on duty for a short while, and one of his first tasks was dropping many of the employees - just before a conference hit town.  Oops.From our visit, many of those affected were servers (and thus made service really slow), but they were also the ones who did the ordering of supplies (meaning about half the menu was not available) and also knew how to adjust the thermostat (which made the room uncomfortably warm most of the night).  Yes, it was like sitting in a jungle in Southeast Asia.  At least it is an Asia restaurant, so the atmosphere is correct.Whatever the case, we arrived a bit early for a surprise birthday gathering - for our man Pourina - which blocked off a huge percentage of the dining side of the establishment (the other side is mostly for bar patrons).  This meant that there were not a lot of tables available.  Yet the few workers who were still employed (the GM in question and at least one of the owners) were running around like madmen trying to keep up, and they did not do a good job at it at all.After ordering a drink and a sandwich, it was about half an hour before we found out neither had even been submitted.  The drink problem was rectified fairly quickly, but the sandwich could not be fixed, because they had run out of baguettes the night before, and no one told anyone.  So we ordered some other appetizers.  One after another, we were told they were out.  Eventually we ended up with an order of tacos, an order of wings and several orders of dumplings - because that was about all they had available.Later, we heard that even dinners were being served with extra meat since they had run out of rice.  An Asian restaurant that runs out of rice?  You have to be kidding, right?As it turns out, we were fortunate in that we were among the first people to arrive, and we did get service, albeit almost two hours after we arrived, and not with particularly good food.  The wings - wings, mind you - was the best bet here.  Some did not appear to receive any service at all prior to us leaving, nearly three hours later.  Not even water!  Going to the bar to get drinks did not help much, as it took a very long time to get drinks, even when you took it on yourself.  Not a good sign.Now the location is great - if you can bypass those other problems.  And the staff is nice, being very apologetic.  They even took our Groupon, which we did not really expect.  We were not hit with an 18% mandatory tip and we even scored a free drink (that first one).  I am really glad they took our Groupon, because I did not want to go back and try to redeem it later after this experience.  But they have some huge problems to overcome.  Hopefully they can work out their issues, as there is opportunity here.  It might be too late for this business, however.
2	This place is a low down dirty shame. It's a shame that service and ingredients were not just in short supply, they were.........well, non-existent. I wanted to really to like the place because the food was really good, but dang, how can I when they don't even have rice?The special lil' lady threw a surprise bday dinner and I graciously thank her for that. The restaurant's been remodeled and a complete change  from the previous tenant. Also, the views are still pretty impressive. On top of that, the food was seriously really good. Best Chinese I've had in a while. Enough with the praise though, lets get back to reality. Let the rant begin shall we? There was only like two servers and one of them was the owner. They ran out of bread for banh mi. They ran out of egg rolls. Crab won tons were missing crab. There wasn't proper ventilation so the entire restaurant smelled like smoke, thus probably leaving you smelling like chow mein for a week, and to top it all off they ran out of rice. Yes you heard me, they ran out of rice. How the heck? So anyways, aside from all of those "slight mishaps", I can honestly say the scallion chicken was pretty dang good. I just wish I had some rice. With such good food, it seems they have a lot of potential. I just sure hope they clean up their act, because I do want to see them succeed. I do plan to return for lunch in the near future, and please just have some rice!
1	This place is a shame. With 4 servers and a manager who just looked like an alcoholic old lady they still could not get their act together. The beef taco sauce was good but the meat was really tough. The crab rangoon was empty with no filling and the fryer was too hot so the outside was burnt and the inside raw dough. The "dumplings" were the ones you get in your grocery freezer. My water was only filled at the end of the meal after I asked. When the check came the server shorted me on change. The food took almost 30 mins to get there. So much for a power lunch. A bar is all this place is good for.
1	I wouldn't recommend this place EVER.  The first thing we encountered was the server reading off a notebook page of things they DIDN'T have (which was about 1/3 of the menu).  After replacing our initial choices with items that were available, we received our food (well, some of it).  The server forgot to bring about the half the food that we ordered.  When my friend asked for her rice, it was brought out with a spot of mystery sauce on the top of it...and my other friend never even received her chicken fried rice, causing her to eventually cancel that part of her order.After taking a few bites of my food, I decided it was about the equivalent to the new frozen stir fry bags of food, like Wanchai Ferry, but about half as much.  My friend's food was so bad, she apologized to the server but told her that she was physically unable to eat it because it was gross.  After choking down our meals, one of us was over charged by double on her check, so we had to wait another 15 minutes for that to be corrected.Needless to say, we "wok-ed" out and are never going back!!!
