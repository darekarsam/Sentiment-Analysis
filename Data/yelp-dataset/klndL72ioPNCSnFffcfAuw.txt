1	Note to self: my curly mass of hair can not be handled at a place that takes walk-ins and tells the person who walks in after you they'll be done with my haircut in 15 minutes. Also if someone starts chopping some bangs without warning stop them ASAP. I almost cried after leaving here. At least my hair grows quickly.
5	My cut was done by Janet, a real pro who has been working in the industry for 30+ years. I've paid 2-3 times more than my cut at Great Clips in the past at expensive salons for haircuts that weren't as good. The sign in system is super easy to use, you don't have to call, you just sign in using their app on your phone or you go online and do it. I can't speak for anyone else who cuts hair here but I'll definitely be going back to Janet. Also, it's a nice and clean new space which is always a plus.
5	Been there 5 times now and my haircuts have been pretty decent. They do exactly as I ask. I'm pretty picky with my hair too. Their staff is VERY friendly so I don't understand some of these other reviews. They've been great every time I've been there. Go to Keith if you are a guy looking for a trendy cut. He made my hair look sick! Very talented. Will definitely be going back to see him from now on.
