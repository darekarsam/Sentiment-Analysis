4	I love this place!! I have been eating here for years.  It's a friendly, family owned business and they always remember regular customers.  It's my fav place to grab some take-out from.  The portions of food are generous,  and the prices are good too.  I have never had anything I wasn't satisfied with from here.
5	Very good, the delivery guy always gets to our house in Morningside within 30 minutes, awesome service!!!
5	The best take out in the city! I moved to Mt Washington and nothing compares to China Lin. Try the crab ragoons!
5	This is a great place to get standard, American-style Chinese food. It is very inexpensive and they make the food when you order it instead of taking it from a pan thats been in a warmer all day. Great lunch specials.
2	If you think China Express is good then this is the place for u. I ordered here based on the 4-star review, and I ended up throwing everything away. You get what you pay for I guess. I ordered soup, Lomein, and chicken and broccoli with brown rice for $17. Everything was terrible and I guess brown rice now means the worst fried rice in history. To the previous reviewers....try Jimmy Wans you will be blown away.
5	This is my favorite American-style Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. I've eaten at quite a few and this place is cheap, consistent, and everything is freshly made right when you order it (yes, its frozen, but they don't do that giant vat of crap simmering all night thing). The family that runs the place is really nice and they are quick and efficient. If you're looking for gourmet, you're at the wrong place - but if you just want solid, tasty, cheap Chinese food, China Lin's the right place.As a highlight - their lunch specials at $4.95 and you get a TON of food. GREAT place for lunch.
