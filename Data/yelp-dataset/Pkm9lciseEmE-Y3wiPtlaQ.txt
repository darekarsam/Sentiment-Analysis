5	This place is a drunk lesbian's dream bar. It is the most ghetto lesbian bar I HAVE EVER BEEN TO other than one in Louisville which I didn't actually get to go into. It is dark, musty, dirty and off a scary ass bridge in Polish Hill. If you are ever in Pittsburgh you must go here because it will fulfill your true yinzer postal working lesbian dreams. Downstairs is the leather bar, which I think I ventured to once, middle floor has pool tables and yet another upstairs with a re-finished dance floor and second bar to get down and dance. GO!
