5	Always a sure thing, big fan of Walgreens and this store is solid everytime I go.
5	I've been going to this drug store for 6 years and I just adore this store. The people are friendly and the service is wonderful
1	The customer service at this particular Walgreens is horrendous - from both the checkout counter to the pharmacy.  Never have I experienced such a lackluster attitude towards customers.  I'm generally a fan of Walgreens but I will drive the extra mile to avoid this particular Walgreens.
1	I bought a tube of "Neo#porin" this morning, around 10 AM. The clerk who registered the transaction tried tocheat me out of 40 cents. I can't believe he thought hewould get away with it. I paid for it with a ten dollar bill.He owed me $4.40. He gave me four singles, but nocoins. I thought he might have put them in the bag. He hadn't. When I returned to the register, he had the change in his hand which he had scooped out of thetray that is attached to the register for that purpose.He knew I had overlooked the change and held on toit, in hopes I would exit the store unaware that he hadset it aside. He made no attempt to alert me or give my money back, until I discovered the shortfall. I doubt that Walgreen's approves of employees augmenting their income by stealing petty cash from their customers .I normally shop at Walmart, which has self checkout. The customer handles both ends of the transaction andthe risk of falling prey to employee dishonesty is decreased substantially. I'll keep this incident in mindnext time I'm tempted to stray from that format.
