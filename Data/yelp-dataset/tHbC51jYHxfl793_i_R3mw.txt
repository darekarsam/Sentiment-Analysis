4	The workouts are great. The staff helps you in tailoring the workouts and having a coach in class that helps you with the movements makes it easier to improve!
5	I have been going to this place for a couple of months. I have seen great results when I'm able to go consecutively. The workouts are tough but a lot of fun. The trainers are great, especially the owner Rob.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in Crossfit, beginner or intermediate.
5	Love going to scorpion crossfit.  Went for a free Saturday class and was hooked.  If your looking to get into shape this is the place.  The trainers are terrific.
