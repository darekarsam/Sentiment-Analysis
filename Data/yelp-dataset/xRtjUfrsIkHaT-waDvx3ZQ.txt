5	This is what I have to say about Office Team : "They have a comprehensive knowledge of the business and excellent communication skills make them an automatic choice for my convention needs."Jay Bevington is not only focused and driven in any project she pursues, but she manages to achieve her goals with poise and a heart of gold. Besides being one of the nicest people you'll ever meet, she can offer practical solutions for any situation while still thinking outside-of-the-box. She's a pleasure to work with, and I would highly recommend her for any future projects."
5	I had a great experience with Office Team. They understood the general position I was interested in and did not deviate from that. Not like other temp agencies that try to match you with whatever they have available, and not the position you are experienced in. Office Team found me assignments within the week I met with them. The only negative I would say is that at first, they found me assignments that went below the salary range I requested, but if you are persistent and remind them the salary range you are shooting for, they will try to compensate you accordingly. They were very efficient, and spoke with me weekly to see how my assignments were going, whether I was happy there and answered any and all questions I had. I appreciated the support from Office Team in helping me find my current job.  Worth giving them a call, definitely.
5	OfficeTeam was great to work with! Being unemployed is a stressful time. They presented me to multiple companies in a matter of days and gave me options. They placed me on a fantastic long term project. They have now helped place my sister and friends!
