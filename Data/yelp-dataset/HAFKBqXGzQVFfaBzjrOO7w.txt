5	Dr. Baldwin's practice is small and gives you the small town family experience that is very personable and friendly.  He takes his time to do a great job and explains everything in detail to you.He is not worried about volume and $$$, just herding you in and out like other dental practices in the area.  His staff is great!!!edit - he is located in the University Area
5	I love going to Dr. Baldwin! I've been seeing him for about 3 years, and since I've been in Charlotte I've tended to switch dentists once or twice a year because I just haven't liked any of them. Dr. Baldwin puts you at ease, does a good job, and at a fair price. I agree with the other reviewer that he is not just out for the money. I had wisdom teeth removed, and he told me that while he could and would do it if I wanted him to, he would feel more comfortable with me going to a specialist since it was close to the nerve. The office girls are very friendly and always ask me about things we talked about on previous visits.
5	Dr. Baldwin is God sent. Excellent dentist. He is patient, caring, and wonderful. I had an emergency, he was able to help me right away. He also has a wonderful staff. very cheerful. I would def recommended him to all my family and friends.
5	I needed a dentist right away now that i recently moved to charlotte. I made an appointment with Dr Baldwin and they were able to schedule an app that same day. ..I hate going to the dentist, but he is the best Dr. i had ever visited. all of his staff were very nice and Dr. Baldwin was awesome. he took his time to explain everything in detail.highly recommended.
