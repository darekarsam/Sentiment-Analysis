5	This place is awesome, a little hard to find the front door since there is no signs anywhere on their building.  After speaking to them for a while they even gave us a tour of the place.  It is super clean and very organized in each of the gunsmiths stations.  They are booked about 6-8 weeks out and their prices are a little steep on some things but once you have them do some NP3 work on your gun you will see why it is worth every penny.  They come with a lifetime warranty and after coating my XD9 with NP3 (nickel plated, see pic) I realized that I will not need to lube my gun any longer.  The action is so smooth you can tell it will last much longer also.  I can't wait to bring more guns here.  I am still waiting to get my XD40 back after I had them cerakote the poly lower.  They also do ALL kinds of gun smithing and are very thorough.  You can tell they know what they are doing and are very experienced.  I highly recommend going here and checking out what they can do for your weapons.
5	These guys are the best in the business. Trust me- all professionals, doing nothing but the best gunsmithing and finish work. I'd Np3 everything I own if I could get away with it!Every American needs one of their SR-60, SR-90, or the new SR-21 precision rifles!
5	Flawless... Can't say it any other way. Sent them my AR10, had them strip the upper and do the lower. Long turn time was expected, given their reputation. Well worth the wait! Staff is super friendly and responds to every email/call. Price was great too! $350 OTD.. Will be sending them more of my pistols/rifles.
