4	Great for a sweet treat when you're seeing a show across the street at Metropolis. Try the triple chocolate!
4	My 70th review is of an ice cream place. Coolness, no pun intended. I've stopped here twice when I've had a craving for ice cream. A friend of mine introduced me to this street-side creamery and I am glad she did. I wonder how they operate (or if they even do) in winter, since it's just an outdoor counter in an enclosed space with ice cream in buckets. Anyways, so the ice cream is very good..very refreshing. Staff are hardworking, pleasant, and efficient. There is even an ATM in the corner for your convenience. My only complaint is that people don't know the meaning of a line/cue. You will stand there for five minutes trying to figure out who is on the line and who isn't.
