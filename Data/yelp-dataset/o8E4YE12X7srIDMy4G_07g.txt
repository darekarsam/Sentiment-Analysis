5	Ideal place for a light, friendly, quick and high quality lunch if you are in the area or at the conference centre across the road. Try the soup!!!
5	Tasty, good value sandwich selection.  Great coffee.  And I've just this morning discovered they make a mean bacon roll too, and I'm so fussy about bacon rolls I rarely buy them.  Very friendly staff.
