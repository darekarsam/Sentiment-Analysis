4	Nice Post Office, centrally located in the center of downtown Mesa, though not on the main street, adequate parking, no problems.  Kinda reminds me of my PO back home.
1	This post office is terrible.  I have had 3 packages that were not delivered.  When I call to investigate they are rude.  They tell my that they will look into the matter and call me back and of course they do not.  Moving soon and glad that I dont have to put up with these people anymore.  There is def something shady going on at this location.
1	They don't believe in having great customer service here. Take your business to the ups store on baseline and country club(NW corner by frys). It's worth the drive, and they have amazing customer service!!
5	Was visiting a friend in Mesa and had one international letter I was waiting to mail once I got home.  She told me there was a Post Office closed by and gave me a direction.  It was really easy to find and there was lots of parking spaces.  Inside was clean and my clerk was pleasant and nice.  We've moved from small friendly town in Texas and use to friendly services but wasn't expecting this in a big town.  I was very please to find this Post Office and my Clerk:13.
