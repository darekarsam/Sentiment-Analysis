1	I can't begin to explain the horrible treatment  received here.  Office staff and doctors not trained to treat women with a history of sexual abuse, and apparently without a bit of common sense.  I miss Dr. Brandon - she was the only good one here, but has unfortunately retired.
5	So yes I'm reviewing an OB/GYN...what of it?  I have zero shame and I take my yelping seriously.I'm going to keep this short and sweet - I highly recommend the office.  I was nothing but pleased with my visit.  Nurses and front desk were so nice and Dr. Rollins....she made me feel so comfortable.  Well as comfortable as on can be in stirrups.  She has a easy pleasant bedside manor.  Hopefully my gypsy ways are behind me and I actually stay in a city long enough to see a OB/GYN two years in a row!  Crossing fingers.
5	Awesome staff!  Every single doctor was amazing through both of my pregnancies.  With my first I had HG and the level of care was the best I've ever experienced.  Dr. Rollins is my usual doc and she is so sweet and never makes me feel uncomfortable in any way. I would and do recommend them to all of my friends.
