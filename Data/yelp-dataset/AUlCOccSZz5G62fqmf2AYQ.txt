5	Efrain was a pleasure to work with. After my initial call he came out a few days later to give me a quote on a stamped concrete patio in our backyard. He had an iPad with him and was able to show pix of previous work and different color options which was helpful. On top of that he had the best price by $400. His crew was quick finishing the job in 2 days and no trash was left behind by his workers. I would use Arteaga's again for all my concrete needs.
5	Arteaga Concrete is near completion of a patio and re coating of my pool deck. I'm so pleased with their work, that I'm posting just before completion of the project. Efrain was first to give me a bid and it was better than the others, plus he added a planter and removed a stump, which the others would not do during the excavation. Everyday we saw the progress and the work is gorgeous. His crew is fast, clean and professional. I highly recommend Arteaga Concrete and plan to have them complete a walk way later this year.
5	We moved into an older home that the previous residents had a variety of patio floorings, none of which matched. Efrain gave is an estimate to replace it that was higher than another we got but we had a good feeling about him. Turned out we were right. The old flooring gave Efrain repeated headaches because of the paints and stain that were there from before. Efrain did not give up until job was completed to our (and his) satisfaction without ever mentioning an increase in cost.We highly recommend him and his crew.
