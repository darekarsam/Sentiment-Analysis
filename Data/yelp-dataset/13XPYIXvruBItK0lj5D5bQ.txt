4	This is a great little shop for kids to build a bear of their choice.They also get to stuff it and select its clothes.Its also great for kids parties and keeps kids occupied.
4	Build-a-bear is a great gift shop for children and adults of all ages, who can resist a cuddly teddy bear? If I'm honest, I'm not that fussed but that's probably due to the fact that my mum loves teddies and has them dotted all over the house. At Build-a-bear you can create your own bear from scratch, adding your own personal touches along the way, including picking the stuffing, the cuddlyness and you can even put your own voice inside the bear with a recorded voice box. I find the latter a little creepy.Once your creation is sewn up you can even choose some clothes for them, I saw the funniest ever scuba diving outfit complete with a snorkel and flippers - hilarious!Great for gifts, particularly for children but also anyone who likes cuddly toys really.
4	Despite being responsible for a comically tragic story that happened to a pal of mine a few years ago, I've never really been to enamoured with Build-a-Bear. They're very good at what they do, but since much of a teddy's charm comes from the fact it's very young owner often seems it as a living, breathing friend, involving them in the manufacturing process just seems a bit weird to me.It does crack me up though that you can select the creature's cuddliness, and the range of styles, outfits and accessories for your choice is almost mind-boggling. I must agree with Eleanor about putting your own voice in the bear though. That's horror movie territory.
4	This place is heaving during the merry season. However, I can see why the kids love it. As the name suggests, you can build your bear from scratch. This is great for those of us who aren't talented in knitting and crafts (or simply don't have the time) and can be a great individual gift for the big or small kids you may know.
