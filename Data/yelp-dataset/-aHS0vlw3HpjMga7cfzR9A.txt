1	New place in Hard Rock, I thought I would check it out. I ordered a panini, and was given a cold sandwich. I then informed the clerk that a panini is supposed to be warm..and pressed. She was pretty rude about it and said, "you know it would have been fine either way" when I got the sandwich back thrown sloppily into a bag I took a bite.. and it was still cold in the middle. Big time fail. I will never go back. When I checked my reciept to see the name of the place for the review, i also noticed that I was overcharged..
4	This place definitely hit the spot 4 days in a row during my last vacation to Sin City!Their paninis are delicious! They have naked juice, fresh fruit, and best of all, it's relatively cheap (considering the fact that this is Vegas). My favorite panini was the "Quixote".
4	Alright, they make some bad-mothuh-truckin' espresso drinks, so I am definitely a fan.For Vegas, the prices are pretty legit (i.e. $4.75 for a large blended drink, $4.00 for a medium latte, etc. etc.)There is a Starbucks right around the corner--well, around the corner and down some way--but I would take the time to head to Espumoso just because the cost is about the same, but the drinks really do taste better.The service is lacking a little bit, but what can you expect? It's the Hard Rock Hotel and all of those kids working there have some kind of attitude (unless you're in the HRH tower, then you're golden)Go forth my dear reader, and enjoy some coffee made with a REAL espresso machine.
1	Grease and coffee smell are mixed in the most unpleasant way. Not so inspiring. Espresso is average, at best.
