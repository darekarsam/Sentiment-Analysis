5	What an incredible idea to have a skate bowl at a bar. There's actually two of them. Used sofas, cheap drinks and skate boards hung on graffiti walls make for an unpretentious night out. Loads of fun guaranteed. There's also an outdoor patio with lots of seating. Met the owner Joe, super nice Venezuelan guy (as am i).  Loved this place. I'm a fan!
5	This place is right up my ollie.$6 tall boy PBRs...50/50Real fun joint - but couldn't flip one.
3	Amusing concept, a skate park inside a Bar, why not.Could have been better with a a bit more beers on tap. But it's pretty cheap (14$ for a jug) Old and used sofas (but comfy) not many places to sit.Some metal concert upstairs and mor elike a "DJ/HipHop" downstairs.It's fun for a bit but I wouldn't go there a lot(Who said I was too old for this shit ???)
1	are you a band looking to play a show here? don't. they're unclear about how much the.venue costs to rent, leading us to believe the venue was $100, but in reality was $300+. we had a show with just under 100 people there and cleared $400 at the door, and they took almost all of it. the 4 bands were left with $15 each. when we tried to talk to the manager about this clear injustice, he basically just told us to $#%& off and that 'business is business'. highly suggest you stay away.gotta say that sound guy and bartenders were great and really friendly.
1	The bar and venue are cool but the manager was completely unfair in paying the bands playing the venue. When we played there the he pocketed something like 80% of the door money and when we tried to discuss this with him he was extremely rude. Strongly advise bands to avoid this place.
