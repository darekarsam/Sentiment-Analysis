5	This is the best car stereo shop in town. Excellent service and lots of brands to choose from.
5	I love this place!! I go there for my every car need and my cousin also goes here. They always give the best deals compared to the other places and even onlIne. My family has been shopping here for 6 years and good experience everytime!!!
5	I had an excellent experience at this place.  I just got a new Versa that didn't have Sirius XM built in. I called Car Stereo Warehouse up on the phone and the guy on the other end was extremely nice and humble. He told me it would be between $75-$100 to install my Onyx XM radio that I ordered off Amazon. I go in there the next day and the places is banging with business, very busy.  The Car Stereo Warehouse is very much not hurting for customers. I bring this up because the installer, Cisco, still took the time to talk to me before hand, did the job promptly and then explained everything afterward, including how to get the radio registered, etc. He did a really good job on the wiring, too. Barely visible wires. Best of all was that they charged me only the $75.00. I would absolutely recommend this place. They treated my dinky-a*s job like it was the most important one of the day.
4	I received a competitive price and good install on a kenwood head unit.  I would go back.
5	Great Prices, Great Service. Clean Install. Would definitely recommend them to all. Had a new stereo installed with them the other day. Finally a audio company that's not trying to knock you over the head.
4	I had a new stereo put in my car. Arsalam took good care of me. Stereo and install was cheaper here than Best Buy and the staff was really helpful. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the environment was really loud with lots of young men (customers) milling about with the F-word every 5 seconds. Not a place to bring the kids but if you can look past the rough exterior these guys are doing great work and providing a lot of value for the dollar.
