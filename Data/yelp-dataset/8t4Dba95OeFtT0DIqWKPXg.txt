4	Quality late night food can sometimes come from surprising places, Spicy Bite is one of those and it comes in the form of pakora (made here not bought in), this is my main reason for coming here. They offer kebabs, burgers and pizza too, but I recommend the pakora...I have yet to try a curry (they stop making them at a certain point in the evening) however I fully intend to at some point.
