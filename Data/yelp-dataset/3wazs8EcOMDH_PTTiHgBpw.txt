5	Had a wonderful lunch there yesterday with my 92 year old fussy Czech mom. We both loved the homemade luscious mushroom soup, Russian egg, roast beef with blue cheese chlebricky (or small wonders),fabulous chocolate desserts and perfect cappuccinos. House white was excellent. A perfect lunch spot.
4	Cafe Prague is a nice coffee, snack, breakfast/lunch spot. Nicely decorated, table seating and good coffee.
5	Best cafe latte Ive had in Montreal. Food and desserts were excellent too...though I did not find any references to Prague on the menu....only pictures on the wall....some strudel would have sufficed.
4	Had the best coffee ever here and the food was great!   Didn't get 5 stars because a place with czech in its name should have strudel for sale.
4	Lovely looking place with gorgeous high ceilings. Really nice coffee to be had here and every member of the staff is friendly and warm. I come here for lunch now and then as it is close to my office. The little toasts are always super good and come with all sorts of toppings: Russian egg salad, tuna, smoked salmon, various types of meat, etc. The desserts are all quite gorgeous looking as well, but usually I am too full to go there! I will say that it is kinda pricey, but at least the food is good, so that helps to take the sting out of the lunch bill.They lose a star for saying that the soup was vegetarian...it had chunks of bacon and the guy shrugged when he saw me picking them out.
