5	50% off for seniors. Lots of quality brands.  Supports a great cause.  Store was clean.  Clothing hung up well.  Able to slide hangers to look at items. Not overstuffed racks. Great staff and great bargains.
4	The store is clean and they seem to have a lot less crap than other thrift stores.  It's a bit pricey IMO for a thrift store but the overall selection is better and it's a good place to score unique items.
