5	Great Food and GREAT Service.  The best fish in the Madison area i have ever tired.  My first time there and I will be back for sure.  Cant wait to thy the smoked prime and the brisket
5	This was, quite honestly, one of the best fish fry's that I've ever had!   My wife and I were seated immediately and enjoyed fast, friendly service all the time we were here.   Every part of the meal was outstanding--the fish was crisp, light, and not at all greasy--even the sides were superb!    If you're looking for the Ritz, look elsewhere.  However, if you are looking for excellent fish at a reasonable price with great service, then Patricks is for you.  We'll be back--and soon!
5	Having been so impressed with the fish fry, my wife and I came back for their breakfast and, wow, that's great too!  I had an omelette and my wife had the biscuits and gravy, and both were outstanding.  We had the place to ourselves which is unfortunate cuz this place is excellent--for all meals.
