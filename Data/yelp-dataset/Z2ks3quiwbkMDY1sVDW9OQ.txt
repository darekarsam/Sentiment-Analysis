2	It's MCDONALDS! You wanted a review.. Ok keep your panties on... here it is...The place is always slammed (yay for fast food).. You think going into a drive-thru is fast.. It's not. Make sure you check your order as it often comes back wrong - the place is run by 16-19 year olds I swear to god. It's a clean place. Well there's something.. It's fast food so you don't have to cook - although I don't know why I'm saying fast in anything because they are not here.. Lastly, it's on the way through Mt. Holly on the way to 85. And that's your 20 second review.. I warned ya.
1	Stay away. Since my review nearly a year ago, this place has gone from bad to worse. Every order is wrong. The problem exists at both the ordering process in the drive through, but also in the order picking by staff even if the order was right. How sad. This is the worst McDonald's and worst customer service of any restaurant in any category. Here's what to expect:Long linesRude customer service that claim its the customer's faultIncorrect orders every timeCold friesThis is one of the restaurants I worry about that spits in food that retaliate insteed of fixing problems. They have added convenient waiting stations for your car to park so that they can hopefully match the order with the car. Too bad even then the orders are not right. What's worse? Nothing changes even when they aren't busy. Avoid this location.
3	I've been to it a few times over the years, and I've never had a major issue with this store. I tried the new Chicken Bacon Wrap and it was tasty. If in the area and hungry, I would return.
3	Went right after lunch rush so it was a little messy, however the manager in charge was great.  Yes, they did forget my kids milk and toys, but gave it to me and apologized. I'm not a huge mc d's fan bcuz of health reasons, so I gave it a 3 but service was a 4.
