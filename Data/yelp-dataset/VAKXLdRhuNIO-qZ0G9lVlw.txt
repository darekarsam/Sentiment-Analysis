5	Mandy is such a talented hair stylist! She's always super helpful with new ideas and tips on styles and overall care. She is flexible with her schedule and always puts her clients first. Going to her is always a relaxing and positive experience! Highly recommend her to all the ladies and guys!
5	Mandy is awesome! Very personable and we always have something fun to talk about, although I don't really care what my hair looks like I mostly go for the shampoo and to catch up with my favorite hair stylist!
5	I've always been VERY cautious about where I get my hair cut and colored. I've had some terrible experiences.That being said, I will never go to anyone but Mandy again!The atmosphere was soothing and contributed to the overall excellent experience I had. I love the way my hair looks and feels; never damaged, always silky and healthy when I walk away from her chair. She's cut and colored my hair (both deep brown and bright purple) and I couldn't express my satisfaction in its entirety. Best part: my trips to her salon never break my bank!!Stop searching for your new hairstylist; you've found her.
5	Just got back from my appt. with Mandy, what a sweet girl.  Scheduled me for a next day appt.  even though she was super busy.  She did an ombre color for me and did a great job.  I appreciate the fact she explained the process and offered suggestions/advice.  Reasonable prices too.  Highly recommend.
