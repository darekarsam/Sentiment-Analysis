5	This place should be getting reviewed up the wazoo.  I'm not from the area (having moved away about 2 decades ago but I have family who still live there), but whenever I'm back visiting family, I drop in here for a class or two, and it never lets me down.  The teachers are excellent.  Try one of the aerial classes, and the Jukari Fit-to-Fly and Fit-to-Flex are great too.  It's great to have a place like this in Pittsburgh, finally.
5	Fun Kewl place to learn new workouts ..
3	One of their private classes is a great idea for a girl's night.  It was fun, but definitely more difficult than I thought it would be.  Many of the girls in our group ended up with some nasty bruises!  Our instructor was friendly, and very encouraging.  We learned a lot, and definitely got a good workout.The only real problem I had was that they need to be more clear about what guests should wear.  I couldn't find any info on the website, so we figured regular gym clothes would be fine.  Some of the people in our party were wearing yoga pants, and unable to do some of the moves because they needed to be wearing shorts.
