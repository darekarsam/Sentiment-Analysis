4	The place doesn't look like much, but their food is great. They just painted it bright orange and green, so it actually stands out now like it should rather than just being an overlooked secret.
4	Delicious!  We really liked the horchata.  The grilled meats had an excellent flavor.
4	Yum yum yum! The beans in the bean and cheese is good! Lost a star because a few times ago that I went here I ordered a carne asada quesadilla and there was barely any cheese it was more like meat and tortilla. Cheap Mexican food that tastes yummy!
4	The carne is grilled out front every morning which causes a plume of beefy delicious smoke to rise into the air in front of the brightly painted building. Their beef is always grilled right with good crunch from the outdoor charcoal grill.  Where most local Mexican places go wrong with their carne asada burritos they do it so right. Carne, beans, cilantro, onion. Done. The only negative is they don't open until 0800 and there's always a line
