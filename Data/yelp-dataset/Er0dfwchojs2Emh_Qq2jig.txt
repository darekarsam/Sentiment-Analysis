5	As far as a pure golf spot, you must try Troon North. This place is a great change of pace. I actually had lunch and kicked it by the pool afterward, too. Places like this really make me appreciate the "world class" golf that North Scottsdale has to offer. This is to golf what North Shore is to surfers.
