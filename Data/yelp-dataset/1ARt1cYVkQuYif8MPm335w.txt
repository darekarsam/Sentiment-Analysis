5	What a great company. The Owner Preston sprays our home himself. He does an amazing job very professional and on time. He is very good at what he does.
5	Preston Crandell has treated multiple homes for me for pests and for termites.  The service was always on time, on budget and effective.  I always chose to work with locally owned businesses when possible and have been a long time fan of this company.  If you need service, do yourself a favor and call Crandell Pest Control
5	These guys spray my house at least once a year. I have little kids and scorpions, so it's nice having the peace of mind that my kids aren't going stumble upon one. The guys are all super nice, Scott came out for me this time and was right on time, friendly, and quick. Very much appreciated.
