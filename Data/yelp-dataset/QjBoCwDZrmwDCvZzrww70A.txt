4	Both my Mom and Dad go here Dr. Skinner is great.
1	Sadly, I have to give this office one star for the dentistry.   The front office makes the difference for lack of any more.  They have mishandled the paperwork for me and my husband during every visit we had.  They sent us a refund, then a bill for the same visit, and couldn't explain why.  Good dentist, crappy front office.
1	First visit this morning.  They never told me the first visit would be an hour and half - so i let them do x-rays but frankly it is a huge inconvenience to schedule another appt to finish the first visit.  The blond girl with the squeaky voice in the front office has the personality of fly - annoying.  The waiting room was dark and dingy and they have T.V.'s going in every room - sensory overload!  I was not impressed and i will NOT go back - there are nicer terrorists then the girls in this front office.  NO THANKS!!
