4	I've been to Ouzeri about 4 times. I've never been disappointed. That being said I've not been blown away either. I would have preferred to rate it 3.5 stars but we can't. The service is always friendly. No complaints. I enjoy their meze plate. Don't be shy to give it a try!
5	First visit this week. Was great, good food, good prices, great discovery.
4	Not too much to say here that hasn't been said. Been looking for a quality Greek place and this scratches the itch. Mid-high end so it would work as a nice date place as well but it's the food that's important and it's right on. I've been looking for a good, fired at the table saganaki since I had my first years ago and I found it here along with multiple other well done tapas.
