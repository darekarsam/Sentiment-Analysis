4	The owner is super-friendly and there are so many unique items in here.  Love the P-Rogue cards.
5	A Hidden Gem! We had searched high and low for a floral designer with a more modern/current aesthetic in the area and finally found that with Urban Gypsy. The owner Paulette has an incredible spirit and kindness--you will simply enjoy just talking to her as you plan your wedding flowers. She truly customized our wedding day floral design and executed it fully. I couldn't be more pleased with the look of my wedding bouquets, decor, and centerpieces. She has a truly modern vision and thinks outside of the box. Stop into her store too, she has an amazing array of vintage jewelry and other items. I will definitely work with her again if given the opportunity.
5	Went with Urban Gypsy for our wedding flowers and couldn't be happier.  Everything was excellent and UG was very easy to work with.  She listened to what I wanted and delivered more than expected.  I highly recommend.
5	She was a pleasure to do business with and I learned a lot from our initial consultation from her. Her flowers are top notch and I recommend them to anyone!
