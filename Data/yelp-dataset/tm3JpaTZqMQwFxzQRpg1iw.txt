1	I am hoping my experience will match the other yelper. So far l've had a very bad experience just trying to be seen. Fax is impossible to get through. Call is worse have called in more then 4x. Two of those calls where over 20 minute wait time and a third was 30min. Just to drop off copies of my lab work took 20min wait after checking in and 1hr the first time then was told I'd get a call back after they determined the urgency of my appt from lab work. 5 days passed when I finally called back to request an appt to the same person I had been dealing with the whole time. Sucks I started this process to get an appt after receiving me referral turned into a 3week process and my insurance was termining. They still couldn't fit me in before my insurance termed. Giving them another chance. This is clearly a issue with this particular staff member. I'm hoping to resolve this issue.
4	Updating my review since my last 1 star review.Staff in treatment area are very friendly and personable. The remember  patients names and are comforting. They even offer lite refreshments, blanket and a comfy lazy boy that I sink into and relax while watching a movie.
5	Wonderful staff.  Always friendly.  They remember you and are genuinely concerned for you. I even get calls to follow up on how I was feeling.
