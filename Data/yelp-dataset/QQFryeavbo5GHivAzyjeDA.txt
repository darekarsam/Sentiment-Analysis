5	I love chorizo and could not find good, authentic chorizo anywhere.  I bought it every grocer in the valley including Food City and just simply never tasted right.  A friend of mine told me about Bill's and my search finally ended.  The tortillas which they sell are outstanding as well!  They have a hot and a mild chorizo available.  I always get the hot.  It's made fresh daily and sells fast.  I absolutely love this little market!
5	Holy cow!!!! Best chorizo is right! Glad I checked the yelp reviews. I made fabulous breakfast burritos & killer burgers from the chorizo. This is my new jam 4 chorizo & tortillas
