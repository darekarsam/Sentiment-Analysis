5	Fiona was an absolute delight. Great coffee, and she was super patient in sharing with me her passion for bikes. If you happen to have a nice day to go along the Lachine Canal, I thoroughly recommend dropping by. Couldn't have been more impressed.
5	If you're shopping around for a bike, looking to get yours fixed or looking for a pit stop while enjoying a great cup of coffee, you've found the greatest place in Montreal! I've been in after a recommendation of a good friend of mine who swore to me that the service was worth the detour. I walked in, and within 20 minutes a was convince that this was my new favourite spot! First of all, the service is amazing. Own by the nicest family in the book, they give you tip and tricks about your bike and inform you with no judgement about anything you wanna know that's bike related. I was in to change my cog and whine up learning a whole lot in the process. I came back to change my chain and because of a five minute wait, they offered me a complimentary cup of cappuccino. Small gesture, I wasn't in a hurry, but it's thing like that, that make you wanna come back time and time again. This bike shop is far from being in my neighbourhood (12 km away) but I'll only go to bike shop. The best in Montreal!
5	More then a bicycle store! This place has some of the best selections on bicycles in Montreal and some great expresso's . The Owner was beyond Amazing and helped me not only find the right choice but help load it. Thank you and I will return soon.
