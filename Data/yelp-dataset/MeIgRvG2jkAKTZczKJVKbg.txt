5	This is one of the best doctors offices/treatment centers I have ever been too. Every staff member from the Medical Assistants to the Front Desk go out of their way to showcase customer service. They also try to know all of their patients by name and have great rapport with everyone who walks in. I like this practice a lot and will continue to come as necessary.
