1	I used this place once, and it will be my last. The place reeked of old urine. I'm not sure if someone has used it as a bathroom, and the place never got cleaned, or what? All I know is that it stinks, and not a good smell at that.
5	This laundry mat is small but tidy and is never over-crowded. The owners are punctual, professional and I see them just about every time I do laundry, cleaning up and providing maintenance if needed. Some places you just can't beat; this is one of them. :-)
3	So, like others, I wasn't really looking to write a laundromat review. However, as I have been here plenty of times (as well as sitting waiting for my laundry to dry right now), I figured why not. It is not a big place, but pretty clean and not overly busy. Nor is it too expensive. I would give the place four stars, except for the fact that one of the dryers once stained my clothes with rust strains and they were a pain to get out. That hasn't happened again, so that is probably my own grumpiness and may very well be ignored. Overall, if you do your laundry at a mat, you could do much worse than going here.
