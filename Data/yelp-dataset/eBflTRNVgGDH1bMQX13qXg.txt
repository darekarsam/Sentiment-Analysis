4	I've always been able to find just the right unusual and unique gift for my wife at La Bella Vita.  the staff is always friendly and very helpful.  Compliments are always received when the items purchased are noticed by others.
5	I found La Bella Vita online because they cary a large selection of jewelry from our favorite Montreal jeweler, Christophe Poly. His work is *stunning*, with layered geometric shapes cast in silver and copper, melded with colorful stones. We first found his rings, necklaces, and bracelets while on vacation in Quebec. Wifey would have bought every single ring she found if I let her. She gets all kinds of compliments on the one ring she did get.Now we're home from vacation and I'm going to surprise her with an anniversary gift from Christophe Poly's collection. Unfortunately, because he works mostly with small galleries and independent resellers, and each piece is unique, his work is hard to find online. Alissa from La Bella Vita helped me select a gorgeous necklace and is shipping it right away so it will get here in time. She was super helpful and friendly on the phone. I can't wait to see the necklace in person. Shhhh... don't tell wifey!
4	I have been ordering Christophe Poly jewelry form La Bell aVita for a few years now.  His work is amazing!  The staff has always been friendly in fixing mix ups and providing photos of stock not shown in their online shop.  I have never visited the store in person because I live in Colorado, but I hope to make it in one day!
