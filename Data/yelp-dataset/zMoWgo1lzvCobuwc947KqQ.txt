5	I just picked up my car today and it is gorgeous (as if it was never damaged in the first place)!  Super fast and friendly.  I recommend them to all my friends and family and wouldn't dream of going anywhere else...  unless I WANT my car to look like crap.
5	They were fast, honest, and did a great job. Their original estimate called for several hours of painting, but when they discovered that they didn't need to paint, they didn't - and didn't charge me for it. Their work was great and I would definitely return.I brought in a Hyundai Sonata. Planet Hyundai referred me to them.
5	I scratched the side of my jetta in a parking garage. visited several body shops approved by my insurance agent and the estimates all came in around $1200.  why?  cuz I scratched right down to the metal so the entire side panel had to be replaced.  stopped here on the basis of yelp'r reviews and Ali said $400.  it took him one day (one afternoon, actually) to buff out the gouges and repaint the door. the paint job was amazing and even in the sun I can't tell where the old paint ends and the new paint begins.  this place is great.
4	Very solid and honest shop! Work with you when insurance is not involved as well. I would recommend to anyone in need.
