5	Super amazing car wash!! This is the absolute best no touch car wash I have ever been in. No need to scrub your car prior, it literally got everything off and I was through some weather, not to mention a cross country road trip full of bugs.The people are all so nice! They look happy to be at work. There is a wide variety of goodies to choose from. Parking is so amazing, there is such a large lot, the gas pumps are easily accessible as well as the the location in general. Be sure to stop in. This Ms. Terribles is fantastic and nothing compared to the Terribles "Chevron" that is just a mile or two away.
3	It's clean and new. Chevron is the only gas station that I know of that sells Real Water.
5	I'm so glad they finally opened this location. It's really convenient b/c the chevron in the smiths shopping center gets crazy. The car wash is pretty nifty too b/c they it's all water powered. The gas station attendants are really polite too. Yay!
1	Very dissatisfied. Tried to use their car wash today. I pulled up until the red light told me to stop. During the first pass of the arms they hit the back of my car causing a small scratch. The arms then just stopped. I went in to tell them. Despite three people in uniform standing there no one knew how to "reset" the arms. They also refused to refund my money. I was told "we don't do that. Here is a code to use the car wash when it is working again. You need to use it within a week" so they want me to go back and use the same horrible cheap car wash that already scratched the back of my car. The scratch is really small but it is the principle of it. For the record my car is not huge it is a Rav 4, so a really small SUV. DO NOT USE THIS CARWASH.
5	Gas on average is about 5 cents cheaper than other chevrons. But i mostly go here for the touchfree carwash. Never had a problem.
