4	It was my first visit to Chicken King since moving to Charlotte. I'd heard nothing but good things about this place so I was pretty sure everyone couldnt be wrong!I went with some co-workers and everyone got something different which was a great way for me to know what else I want to try on the menu. I ordered a chicken sandwhich, my co-workers ordered the chicken philly, philly with steak and peppers and fried fish.My chicken sandwich was messy, but delicious! It's a grilled chicken breast with lettuce and tomato I swapped the mayo for hot sauce and it was perfect. The fries were cooked up fresh to order and for less than $8 I left full and happy.Yep. I'll be back to give more of their menu a try!
5	went to this place while on business in the area a couple times for carryout. Fried chicken was great. A bit of a wait, but that is because they cook it up fresh when ordered. Decent prices too.
4	If you're looking for good cheap food then check out Chicken King. I had one of their fried chicken dinner specials that included three large pieces of chicken, fries and a salad for $7. The chicken was cooked to order so I did have to wait a bit, but it was worth it as the chicken tasted great! A lot of other stuff on their menu too like burgers, cheesesteaks, gyros and a variety of salads and sandwiches. Chicken King is a much better alternative to the Wendy's or McDonald's down the street for about the same price.
