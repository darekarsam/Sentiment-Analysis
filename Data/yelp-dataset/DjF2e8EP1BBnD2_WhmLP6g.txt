5	The staff is very helpful. Ask for Natalia and she will go out of her way to assist you. I will definitely make another visit here again.
1	Beware.
4	Brandon and the W. Broadway location came through when another Enterprise store completely dropped the ball.They were convenient to my hotel and we were in and out of the store in less than 15 minutes.I made the mistake of returning the car to the airport drop off, which incurs a $35.00 fee for not returning the car to the same location.  Brandon was able to refund this fee as the Airport lot and his office are less than 2 miles away.Had I returned the car to Texas, these one way fees are certainly understandable.Hindsight.. I could have returned the car to his store and asked them to drop me off at the airport. I already paid for the day, the gas and had unlimited mileage.My mistake, not there's.
1	I am a pilot and these guys wouldn't take me to work at the airport claiming they would be fined $250,000. BS! I had to haul ass and was almost late for work. They just didn't want to encroach on there system of the airport car rental service.
