4	Took me few months to try Le Petit Sao, should have done it earlier. I just had the pho and now I have the legal right to write a review. The restaurant has simple and modern design, service is friendly and quick. The food is really good, so far have tried most of the salads, which are superb and the rolls. The pho is yummy, add the spicy lemongrass if you don't mind it hot. There is a short list of wines on the menu and few Asian beers. How lucky I feel to have a Vietnamese joint within walking distance from my place. Guess who will be regular there.
5	Amazing food! What a gem in nuns island. Hidden in the back of the shopping centre, this place has everything going for it. A relaxed atmosphere with sophistication, great and kind staff and prices that reflect the quality lunch. Honestly, everything on the menu is great, but my recommendations are the Avocado & Grilled Chicken Bahn Mi and their homemade spring rolls. Both great options. Look forward to returning and a must try, if your looking for a quick and satisfying lunch in nuns island.
