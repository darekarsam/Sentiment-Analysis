5	Won me over and earned my business today; didn't even make a purchase. Ed was willing to advise me over the phone and was extra helpful when I came in--the tip he offered up appears to have worked. They stock hard-to-find items/parts (the only place in town that had leak detecting dye), and when I was there, some of the other customers appeared to be pool repair guys/contractors, for what that's worth. I'll definitely be back for my pool care needs, and if I ever need service, they'll be the first place I call.
5	These folks are the most knowledgeable, economical, honest and nicest people you will ever meet. You can't go wrong for all your pool supplies and equipment! They always go the extra mile for the customer and did I say the nicest?
5	The team in the store is very helpful and is always willing to go the extra mile. It is refreshing to work with a pool store that shows me what i need vs. what i should have. Thank you Swimming Pool Warehouse.
