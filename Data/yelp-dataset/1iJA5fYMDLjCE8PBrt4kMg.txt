4	I have noticed this deli for a while, it is right down the street from my work.  Today I thought I would give it a try and am glad I did!  It is a family owned shop, very friendly people.  I ordered the Albondigas Soup, fresh and homemade and quite delicious!  The menu looks like a wide variety and great prices.  I can't wait to go back to try one of the sandwiches!
5	Great sandwiches and the owners are so friendly!
5	I love their whole menu. I always get fast and friendly service. Never had a bad experience. Love this place :-)
5	Amazing sandwiches and soup. Today I had the albondigas soup and the roast beef sandwich. They were both so good.  The wait staff was friendly and helpful as well!This is the second time I have eaten here and I am truly impressed!
3	Was looking for a change of pace recently. I love hidden treasures in the valley and figured I'd try this one. After all, it was rated 5 stars. I tried the chicken filet sandwich just like the picture. The first half was good until I noticed it was precooked frozen chicken, like the bags that Costco sells. Because of that I don't think I'll be coming here again. I feel that there are better sandwich shops around the area. 3/5 stars I feel is more than generous of a rating.
5	delicious soup  & great customer service.
