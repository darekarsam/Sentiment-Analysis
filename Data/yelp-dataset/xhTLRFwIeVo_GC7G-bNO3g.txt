2	Eh, in place of Debbie Gate's All-not so good grill.  New owner has painted the place, cleaned it up some, it is better but not a great interior due to how it was designed and age.  Some of the lights hanging as if on a construction sight.  Lights behind the counter are just to glaring when hanging out.  Really need to fix or cover.  The staff/waitress's are the same as the prior restaurant.  Nice and friendly and do an OK job.  Menu has many types of burgers, sandwiches, salad, chicken waffles and breakfast items.  Every Thursday the menu includes Ribs.  Ribs were pretty standard ribs that are about as good as any in the area, had a little sauce that was sweet with a little spicy flavor.  Had a side salad of linguine with cheese, pepperoni, olives and a dressing.  Salad was OK, a little to cold at first.
2	Sorry, but I can't say anything good about this place.
5	Amazing place with great food and friendly service! The restaurant owner has recently changed. The owner made the food fresh as soon as we ordered. Affordable food and great quantity. Every item I have tried has been amazing. If in the area, check it out! I definitely recommend this!
2	I was on the search for a new breakfast place to try. I have a regular place down the street which is excellent.I walked into a an empty place and when I left it was still empty.The place had a heavy old grease smell.My coffee was not hot. The sausage patties were tasty, but much too salty.Eggs were ok. The "Italian" toast was some cheap white bread They only offer turkey bacon.The interior is very bland, uncomfortable booth. The cheap lights were very glaring. The waitress was nice and helpful.The cook could barely speak English .I really wanted to like the place , but it just didn't make it. It needs better food and a better interior feel.
