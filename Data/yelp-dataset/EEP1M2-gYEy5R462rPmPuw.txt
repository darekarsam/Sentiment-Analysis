4	I come here on Wednesdays for my weekly dose of zumba with Amanda! The facilities work and the staff are very nice. The zumba class is excellent. It is a lot of fun and I am getting a great workout.
5	My daughters have danced at Wagner for 14 yrs. The recital is always the high point of the year. Daddy daughter dance is my favorite. Teachers have always been great.
1	Front desk lady is nice nasty. Instructors are average at best. My daughter, who is a great dancer, was bored and unchallenged.
