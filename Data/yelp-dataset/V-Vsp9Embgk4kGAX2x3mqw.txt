1	This company put out a Living Social deal for a deep clean on a house and have received many many purchases.  Since I am moving out of my house I bought the deal and have called twice every day to schedule my appointment.  They have not once answered the phone or returned any of my messages.  I have 2 days left to cancel my purchase and will be doing so promptly after this posts.
1	Do not use this company!  Bought a living social deal that seems like a scam as I have called 7 times to try and book with no returned call . If you too bought the deal file a complaint with living social ASAP.
1	Same as everybody else... bought the deal, called every day for a week, no return call... called Terry A. no answer... who knows what or why but DO NOT BUY THE LIVING SOCIAL DEAL. And how does she have 5 stars here when everybody is giving her 1?
1	I'm glad the owner gave herself five stars! Like everyone else- I called numerous times before I reached someone, made an appointment and then never heard from them.  Called about 10 times to confirm my appointment and for several days after they no-showed. Never got a return call. Too late to get a refund from living social so I got their "bucks" instead. I cannot believe living social is offering them again, as is Deal Chicken.
1	I could not be more annoyed by this company if I tried!!!  Purchased the voucher through Living Social on July 7 and had an appt. scheduled for the 24th.  They were a No Show.  I phoned Maid by Design and no one answers the phone.  I called Living Social and they got in touch with owner, Terry, who told them my appt. was for the 31st (not true).  So, I tried to call to confirm the appt. for today and still no answer.  No one showed up this morning at the appointed time.  I called Living Social and told them I wanted a refund and they agreed to return the charges to my credit card.  STAY AWAY FROM MAID BY DESIGN...SOMETHING SMELLS REALLY ROTTEN WITH THIS BUSINESS.
1	The way Maid by Design conducts business is absolutely appalling. First, it is damn near impossible to get in contact with anybody. I tried for 2 weeks before someone finally got back to me. And it was via text message or email. I have not been able to speak to a live person.Secondly, despite "being on the schedule" for my appointment today. They never showed up. I called numerous times today, again to no avail.Lastly, when someone finally answered the phone today, I was hung up on. I would avoid this business AT ALL COSTS. I've already reported them to LivingSocial and I don't expect their business to be around much longer. AVOID MAID BY DESIGN. You've been warned.
1	Just to make everyone aware living social IS giving refunds! I was emailed today and told mine would be available in 3-5 days so if you are as un happy with this company as we are please contact them!!I called so many times to try and scheduled it was crazy! I wrote on Facebook, I emailed. I am one step away from calling the news. I can't believe anyone would operate their business this way! Good luck everyone!
1	If I could give no stars I would too. I was reluctant to try this Living Social deal with a company that was, at the time, not rated and now I wish I had listened to my gut. Customer service is non-existent. When I did speak to someone to set up the appointment, she was rude and seemed very distracted. I think she is overwhelmed with the response to the $69 4,000 sf deep house cleaning deal on Living Social and now has no way to complete the jobs. I have yet to read a review of Maid by Design even showing up. I am so disappointed with this company AND with Living Social for not doing a better job screening these bogus companies. I am going to request a refund and never use either company! This is one of those "too good to be true" scenarios!
1	SCAM. STAY AWAY. Like everyone else, I purchased a Living Social deal for this company last week. I received an email from Living Social this morning saying "You recently redeemed your deal to Maid by Design. How did it go? We want to know."I was confused as I have NOT redeemed the deal or made an appointment yet, so I logged in to see if it was a mistake. My account said that the merchant (Maid By Design) marked the deal off as "redeemed". I called Living Social and the rep tried to get a hold of the merchant while I was on hold, but not surprisingly they could not reach her. They will try again within 24 hours and then escalate the problem. I just want my money refunded at this point.
1	If I could give them less than one star I would. I bought a deal through Living Social. Then I called them to schedule my service I left 5 messages over a 3 week period. Nothing. Nada. No call back. They never answer their phone. Then, today I got an email from Living Social that I redeemed my coupon. They wanted to know how the service was. Ha! I called them to explain and they said they will return my money. The ad is still running though! I'm sure I'm not the only one. It seems like a scam to me.
1	Waste of time! Do not buy this living social. Never returned phone calls or showed up for scheduled appointment. SCAM ALERT!!!!
1	PROBABLY A SCAM - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!! I was interested in purchasing their Living Social deal, but had some questions. I called & left a message twice in 2 days, as well as filling out their web form and never heard back. I'm thankful that I did not purchase after seeing all the other posts on YELP. ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10 THEY GET A MINUS 20.
1	Yup, just like the other reviewers, I got jipped. Bought their Living Social voucher, then suddenly received an email saying my voucher had been redeemed--what??Called MbD, no answer. Emailed Living Social, they said to just call MbD. Duh. Called MbD again, and again, and again. No answer.Ended up getting a refund from Living Social.
1	I wish it were possible to give negative stars. DO NOT PURCHASE A LIVING SOCIAL COUPON FROM THIS COMPANY. I'm not sure how they can keep offering these deals to living social but purchased my coupon almost a month ago. Have tried on numerous occasions to contact them via phone and email to schedule an appointment and nobody will answer me or respond to schedule an appointment. I'm not even bothering and went ahead to request a refund. It sucks because I'll get credit and not cash back since it was so long to no fault of my own. BUYER BEWARE.
1	People Listen ~ Please, Please, just like everyone else posting there rating, do NOT use this service or you too will be a VICTIM. Horrible customer service, called for over a week left repeated messages and got no response!
1	Worst company ever! DO NOT USE!  just like all the other reviewers said..i waited a month for them to fit me in the schedule..my appt was today and surprise surprise..NO SHOW.  I called, facebook messaged them, emailed them at least a dozen times.  How is this company not out of business with all the negative feedback.  Living social needs to remove this deal as well..they shouldn't be supporting a business like this! CLOSE THIS PLACE DOWN ASAP SOMEONE!
1	BUYER BEWARE!! My Wife also purchased a Living Social deal with the hopes of having a nice clean house. We should of known something was up when we tried for a couple of weeks to get a hold of someone at the company to make an appointment or at least return our calls. Right about the time we were going to stop trying and get a refund from Living Social, my Wife was able to get a hold of someone. She spoke with a female at the company and set up an appointment for a cleaning on the 15th, between 11-12. After the appointment was set up my Wife received an email from Living Social confirming her use of the voucher. My Wife reply saying she has only made the appointment and the services have not been used. So, Friday the 15th rolls around and we should of seen this coming, no one shows up. At 12:00 I call the number on the voucher and website, no answer, so I leave a message. Then we notice on their Facebook account they give a number to text for urgent matters. I try texting that number, no response. So at about 2:00pm, I give up hope that anyone will be coming or that I will receive any sort of response or reply. This is a sad excuse for a company!!!  I can understand that sometimes things happen that are out of your control, but it seems like this company is doing its best to screw anyone and everyone. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!***Update as of 08/22/14**********************************************After emailing all the email address this company has we finally heard back from the company.

I'm sorry if your grandmother died, and if that has something to do with why people are not getting their houses cleaned, then there are SO many different ways that you could have handled that. Since you asked what happened, I will tell you. I got a living social voucher. I called to make an appointment and left a message. I called again to make an appointment and left a message again. I called a third time, talked to someone and set up an appointment for my house to be cleaned on the 15th. Someone was supposed to come between 11-12. No one came. My husband called. Then he got on facebook and posted a comment looking to see where the cleaners were. He texted the number that you posted on facebook. No response. No one showed up. Nothing.  That's what happened.___________________________________________________________Second email chainFrom: Stephanie Gillis Sent: Friday, August 15, 2014 5:37 PMTo: Info@maidbydesign.netSubject:  I have a question:How come you didn't show up for our appointment?____________________________________________________From: Tabitha Batemann info@maidbydesign.netTo: 'Stephanie Gillis' Sent: Wednesday, August 20, 2014 7:53 AM To whom it may concern, If you have a Living Social voucher and would like to scheduled.

1	I just saw this deal on Deal Chicken and so I thought I would post my review so no one would buy this.  I find it hard to believe that the people from Deal Chicken wouldn't look at these reviews and see that there are over a dozen  reviews for this company at this point and all of them are 1 star.  Why in the world would Deal Chicken do business with these people.Anyway, when I saw this on Living Social it was the same day my wife went out of town.  I thought it would be nice if I got the house professionally cleaned while she was gone.  I called and immediately got someone (this was a Thursday).  I told the person that I need to know if they had anything available from that Thursday through the next Tuesday.  She told me they could get me in Tuesday at 2 pm.  I told her that would be great and that I would then buy the deal.  I asked her if she needed anything from me and she told me to give her the code so I gave her the voucher number and she marked it as redeemed.  When Tuesday morning came around I hadn't heard from them to confirm so I called and left a message to verify they were still coming.  They never called and they never showed.  By Thursday I had never heard anything (I had left one more message) but that was the last day to get my money back from Living Social so I called for my refund.  They said that because it had been marked as redeemed they couldn't do it.  I told the lady that they never showed and she said they had to get a hold of Maid by Design.  They emailed me every other day during that time letting me know they were still trying to get a hold of Maid by Design.  All during this time the deal was still available.  It seems crazy that they would even be offering a deal when they aren't even able to get a hold of the business.  Anyway, a week later they finally gave me my money back.  What a terrible experience!
1	And shame on me for letting them "not show up" twice.  I missed 4 hours of work total sitting home waiting (3 hours the first time and 1 hour the second time).After the first time (July), the owner (Carrie), apologized up and down (once I finally got a hold of her), put me on the schedule for another day (August) and said "I will personally be there to do your house and will call and confirm the day before."Well, I should have known when I didn't get the confirmation call and I couldn't reach her the day before.  But, I waited home anyway.I'm so furious.  Living Social is working to resolve the problem and hopefully I can get some kind of credit.  I hope everyone on these reviews has contacted them so they have records of the problem.P.S.  The day before my first appointment I also received a "redeemed" message and "How did it go?"  Unbelievable.
1	Total scam - this company no-showed and will not return my calls.I see there is a long list of scorned customers before me...Call @LivingSocial:877-521-4191 and they will refund your money as this company has not performed services promised.Hope this helps!
1	Learned my lesson!  From now on I will check reviews on Yelp before I buy anything! By the way, the phone number is now "no longer in service."  What a scam!
