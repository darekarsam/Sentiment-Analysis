5	We recently ordered a Hunter Douglas Luminette shade for our sliding glass door from Regal Upholstery.   Heidi and the team were very friendly and professional, and bent over backwards to make sure we had what we needed.  They came to our home to measure the sliding glass door and help us decide what we needed.  We decided on a Luminette and have been thrilled with the decision!  The order came in quickly and their installer was wonderful!  We were extremely pleased with the service we received from Regal, and we will definitely be back.  We highly recommend Regal Upholstery to all of our friends!

5	Just had our sofa reupholstered by Regal Upholstery.  What a fantastic job!  It was better than I expected.  Jay came out to help us with fabric selection, was not pushy or high pressure.  He understood exactly what we wanted.  Heidi was very helpful on the phone with a couple of suggestions after seeing pictures of the sofa that I emailed to her.  The pickup and delivery men were very professional, on time and respectful.  This was the first time using Regal and I would recommend them to my best friends and family without hesitation. I will definitely use Regal in the future for any additional reupholstering.  Thank you Regal!!
