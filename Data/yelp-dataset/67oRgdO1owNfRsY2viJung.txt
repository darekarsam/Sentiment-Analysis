4	- The food was great- The staff was super friendly and, despite the fact that it's a buffet, started bringing fresh food and drink to our table- No MSG- All you can EATTT
4	I went into Jade Palace for lunch today with low expectations. Truth be told, I was lazy and didn't want to make food. Jade Palace is right down the street from my place.I was pleasantly surprised. While only half of the food looked inviting, everything I chose was actually quite good. I had 2 bowls of soup, 2 full plates, and a small dessert plate. Left quite happy. The bill? $9 plus tax and tip. Yeah, no missing digits there. Positive experience. I'll be back. Good thing - 'cause sometimes I'm just not in the mood to cook.
3	If you ever been to a Chinese buffet, you've already been at Jade Palace. This place is pretty much Fu Lam or Le Mandarin is but with better service.You walk in, get assigned a seat and start to pig out with 50-60 different types of selection available to you. From soups to a variety of meats, to vegetables to salad ending up with a handful of desserts and ice cream.Nothing available really stands out other than my personal favorite the short ribs in sweet sauce which I put on top of some fried rice. So good.Service was quick and efficient. In fact, impressively so.The price tag is excellent. With it being about 11$.This is a solid place to eat once in awhile.
