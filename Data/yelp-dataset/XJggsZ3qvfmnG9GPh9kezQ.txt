4	So far I have tried both the Muay Thai and Jiu-Jitsu. Both classes were fun and a great workout. Despite it being a group class, the instructors do a good job of giving individual attention as needed.Most of the classes have a decent size group attending with a nice mix of students. As someone who was absolutely new to the sport, the classes didn't go so fast as to make me feel over-whelmed nor so slow as not to be a challenge and a workout.Prices are about average from what I've seen for small gyms/martial art places.
5	If you're looking to get in shape, learn self defense, or even aspire to fight professionally.. THIS IS THE SPOT! I've been here for about 4 years now. Everyone is like a big family, friendly atmosphere, no egos..
5	This place is amazing. The level of instruction and knowledge the coaches have here is amazing. They even have great strength and conditioning classes.There is good sense of community there with everyone being friendly. There are kids classes so entire families go to the gym, which I like a lot even though I didn't have one while I was there. They have something for everyone, from children, to complete beginners and out of shape, to professional athletes.
5	This place is a good family gym, but they mean business when it comes to working out. Jarret Aki is a world class trainer!
5	Love it here. Great gym to be at. Everyone from John Crouch and Benson Henderson on down the line treat everyone with the highest respect. A gym should be a welcoming atmosphere and the MMA Lab excels at bringing that to you.
