4	I love Steve's Cafe. They serve lots of good food at a reasonable price. I've never had anything there that I didn't like, but right now, I'm especially into the Southwestern Chicken Wrap!
3	The Good:The owners are super nice. They have a good breakfast burrito. Convenient for anyone who works in the same complex. They have an assortment of sodas, energy drinks, and snacks, which is also convenient for anyone working in the complex.The Bad:The place has the look and feel of a hospital waiting room. Its just really sucky looking and depressing on the inside. The coffee is terrible. They have a $5 minimum on credit card charges, which I think is incredibly petty for a business to do. Everything on the menu is more expensive than it should be. Because of the look of the place, I have been too reluctant to order anything other than the breakfast burrito, so I can't comment on the quality of their other food.
5	It is what it is, and what it is, is, solid diner food -- good, quick, solid, inexpensive, consistent. Steve and everyone there get to know you, if you're even a semi regular, and are quite nice. The omelets are great, the burgers solid, the BLT and clubs familiar and tasty, the fries are great, the salads get the job done....It ain't the Four Seasons, but you're not expecting it to be. Good diner comfort food. Breakfast and lunch.
