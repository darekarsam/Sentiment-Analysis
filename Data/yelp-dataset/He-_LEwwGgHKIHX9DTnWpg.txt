1	Okay so I went here like a year ago and got my nails done by the owner Nikki. They were glitter tips. WOW they looked like my 10 yr old niece could have done a better job. Not only that the whole time she was doing my nails her hand was shaking. I asked her about it and she said it was because she was hungry and her blood sugar was low a proceeded with doing my nails. I would advise anyone not to go there.

5	I LOVE Jessica!!! I've been coming here for years and she does amazing work! Atmosphere: Jessica and the other employees at Flair are polite an accommodating. They make sure I'm comfortable and always offer me a drink.Work: As I said, Jessica does amazing work! I've never been let down. Not to mention she has great hair herself. I've never seen a woman walk out with bad hair (from any stylist).Cost: The cost here is very affordable! I don't believe in spending $150.00 to get my hair looking fabulous--and you don't have to here!Go to Flair! It's fun, clean, and relaxing. I will definitely continue coming here!
