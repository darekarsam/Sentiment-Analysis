1	I would give 0 star if I could. Place closed for night even we had reservation. I reserved it only day I was in the city. Very angry. No wonder they advertised on Groupon and only have one review.
4	I'm not sure of the negative reviews. We had the Groupon and the food was tasty. We were the only ones on a Friday night eating there but it was good. The prices are expensive (You can get a lot better for less) and I would not go without a Groupon.
3	I went during the lunch rush and the service was a bit slow. The carrot soup and vegetable couscous was very good, but a bit pricey for lunch. I got a slice of banana bread to go, but it was the worst banana bread I ever had. Not sweet at all. So don't get that!
