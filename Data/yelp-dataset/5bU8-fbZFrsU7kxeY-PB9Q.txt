5	In Tempe there are many places to choose from when it comes to looking for a bike. Tempe Bicycle is a great location to go to right off the bat. Whether you just want to rent a bike for a day or if you are looking for a road bike to train for your first triathlon (ie: yours truly) they have almost everything you could need plus the service has always been great for me.
5	I knew I wanted to replace my old Trek 720 hybrid with an updated model and saw on their webpage they rented bikes. I tried a test ride on a Giant Cypress that had a great price but decided to wait and do a real test ride and rented it for a weekend.I fell in love with it and my back and shoulders didn't hurt for a nice change. I returned it on Monday and when I got my tax return I called the shop on Apache. They had my model/year in stock and I told them about my renting the bike. The lady informed me my rental fee would count as a payment on the bike purchase. How cool was that?!!! That really helped me get more extras then I'd planned on. I told all my sorority sisters and a bunch of us now have bikes that are so much fun!Why that guy Todd C. (?) keeps bashing this store I just don't know. Maybe he's got nothing better to do than put people down to raise himself up? Forget that guy and try this place out. They are helpful, nice and welcoming.
5	Been going to Tempe Bicycle since I was a teenager, this is by far best in Tempe. Knowledgeable, helpful and friendly staff. Easy parking. Awesome cruiser bikes.
