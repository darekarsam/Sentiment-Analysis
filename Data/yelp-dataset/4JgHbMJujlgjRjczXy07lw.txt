2	Anyone can provide a service and be nice enough providing that service, but when it comes to billing and dealing with insurance - that is when you find out how competent a business really is.  And this is where RedRockEyecare has lost any future business with me.  RRE examined me in March 2014.  They were calling the wrong number to process insurance and said they had rectified the problem.  In November 2014 I received a statement with charges past due because insurance would not go "threw".  When I called and was finally was able to speak with someone in billing they said they would call the correct number (they still were calling the wrong number) and try to get it settled and if they were unable they would call me back on Monday.  I never heard from them so two weeks later I called and spoke to the receptionist and she said the file was on the desk with a note that insurance would not go through.  Still hoping to get this resolved.  Insurance billing is really where a business/doctor shows their true ability when providing professional services.  Just left my fourth message...
