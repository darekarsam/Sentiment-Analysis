5	A perfect place to make your feet happy and relaxed !! Body massage , hand and foot reflexology , manicure and pedicure spa ++++
1	Terrible place, avoid!The therapist hurt my back and did not listen when I asked him to go softer or focus on my neck. I had to stop the massage midway and still had to pay $56 (for less than 40 min), then the manager/receptionist (who had walked in during my massage, adding to the stress) called me later at night to bully me into giving more personal details for my file, like my insurance company... The manager also constantly hard-sells "promotions", even in the massage room, and during my first visit refused to give me an insurance receipt because I did not have time to fill a long form with all those personal details - something we could have done while I was waiting before the massage.
4	The foot and body massage were definitely worth it!  Take a pass on the facial.
