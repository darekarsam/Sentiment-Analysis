5	I was actually looking for absolutely beautiful large silk flowers and had searched high and low.  What visiting from my home in Austin, my daughter in law suggested I try this shop!  What a find!!!  Their flowers are top of the line as well as lovely little nice gifts for loved ones.... doesn't get any better than this!
5	Flowers for my July wedding turned out gorgeous, I'd highly recommend Mt. Lebanon Floral!  (my bouquets/centerpieces were faith roses with cream hydrangea)
