5	I have to say, on one of the busiest days for me, it was also very easiest with the help from Fancy Faces.I booked Party Time with "Belle" for 1 hour and a glitter tattoo for 2 hours with them on line via their web site and got everything set up with them.Day of the party, which was obviously very hectic, I didn't have to instruct or anything.  They came and figured out where to be and when to entertain."Belle" came looking just as we expected and nothing less.  She looked good enough to be in Disney Land/World live-action plays.  She talked/walked/looked like Belle.  Glitter Tattoo artist also came with her own chair and table and got her self set up in a convenient place and under the shade.Only thing was that the glitter tattoo artist came on time but forgot her glitter glue so she had to leave and come back.  She stayed past the original time to make up for the delay.  Regardless though, all the kids loved her and all the tattoos were done great.I would definitely encourage everyone to give this place a try.  They have a lot more than just glitter tattoo and characters.

Dana and her husband are extremely nice people and they are very flexible to work with you for what you need. I am a big fan of this company and will highly recommend this company to anyone.
5	This hotel is located on the 15th floor of theAjo Sun-Times. It is in a great location for visiting the city, seeing the sites and SHOPPING! There are many restaurants near the hotel and Starbucks is just over the walkway to the Market Place. We ate in the bar one night while watching football! It was expensive, for two appetizers, four drinks and dessert I split the bill with my friend! I would suggest going around the corner for food! Also, just so you know, parking is $45 a day!
