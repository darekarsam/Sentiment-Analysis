5	If you are interested in experiencing a total solar eclipse for the first, second or 15th time, Tropical Sails is the company to go with! We've done five eclipse tours with Dan, and had a wonderful time on each one. Our favorite was the 1998 eclipse where we sailed the Caribbean on the S/V Polynesia, watching totality from deck. Well organized and a great group to travel with.
5	I've been on two trips with Tropical sails corp and I have been absolutely satisfied with both experiences.  The trips have been well organized and well thought out from start to finish of the trip.  If you are interested in solar eclipse viewing,  I would highly recommend tropical sails corp, as this is their specialty.  I had my first viewing and it was like magic.  I will definitely be booking with tropical sails corp again in the near future.
5	I've taken four Tropical Sails eclipse tours, and enjoyed each one. They have a perfect record for finding clear skies! My favorite was off the coast of Turkey on the Black Sea. Nothing like sunset over the water all around you!
