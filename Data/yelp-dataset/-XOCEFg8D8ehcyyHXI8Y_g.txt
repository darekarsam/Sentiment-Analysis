1	The staff there was incredibly rude and obnoxious.  I was insulted about my bag which had nothing to do with my purchase.  I am not saying anything about the Affliction company, but I would never return to that location again.
5	Staff was definitelly pretty awesome and helpful. Prices range from low to high, depending on what you are getting.
