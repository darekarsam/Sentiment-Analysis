2	Not a big fan of the postal service... But the best thing they have in there are the automatic machines.  When it takes you less time with a machine than in line for a person,  that is saying something.  Always see a line here especially during the holidays as expected.  Only go when I have to.
4	I like this post office.  This place is clean.  Nice size parking lot.  Nice employees....well nice as they get if you know what i mean lol.  The kiosk is great lol.  and it is in a very convienent location.
3	Not too busy.  Employees are moderately friendly.  Expect to wait in line for a bit on your lunch or after work.
1	Worst Customer service in the world. the lady is rude!
