4	I was traveling to Quebec City and we needed a place to stay for the night before we took the train the next morning. This YWCA is affordable, clean, and convenient!The hotel is on the main bus route from the airport which was nice especially during the winter months. When we visited, it was $75 for two beds. The room was clean and roomy, and had complimentary wifi. We were able to walk to some nearby cafes and take public transport when we wanted to wander around. And, it was within walking distance to Gare Centrale.I prefer staying out by Rue St. Denis, but if I needed to be closer to downtown, this is definitely a wonderful option.
