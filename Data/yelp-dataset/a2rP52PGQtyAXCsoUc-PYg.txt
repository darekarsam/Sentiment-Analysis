3	Over the years I have stopped by this location a few times.  This time I was hungry and drawn in by the buy one get one free offer on the original chicken sandwich, which I think is one of their better staple items, at $3.99.  I did check out the restrooms this trip and found them to be clean and stocked.
3	If I absolutely MUST eat fast food, I choose BK because they carry a veggie burger (vegan if you hold the mayo). Their fries are also vegan and fried separately from the meat products :)
3	Well, I have to say , even with the coupons, it cost me $8.00. ???? Didn't order but 2 of the $1.00 menu a drink and onion  rings.$8.00 . Got to start making better decisions
1	ordered the new A-1 bacon double cheese burger at 5.99 got home and there was no bacon. very disapointed. will return for my money back tomorrow
