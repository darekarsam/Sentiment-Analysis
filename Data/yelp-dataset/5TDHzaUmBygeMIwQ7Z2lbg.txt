4	I tried this place for lunch today and got a lentil salad and a pulled pork sandwich.  The pulled pork sandwich was really good and they did not skimp on ingredients.  The meat itself was tender and moist and overall I really liked the sandwich.  The salad was a little on the bland side but still pretty good.  Service was also pretty quick which is another plus for this place.
4	With a name like theirs, the pulled pork sandwich is the more-than-obvious choice. I got mine outside the Just for Laughs festival, and it was really, really good. Nice portion size and very tasty. My only problem is that I want another one - but first I have to check out the food truck competition..
5	5 stars based on that great pulled pork!For the price you get a nice generous sandwhich. The pork isn't overly saucy and melts in your mouth. Perfect balance of flavors on the seasoning. Would recommend!
4	I haven't really tasted a pulled pork sandwich before until I recently went to this place. I was told about it by a friend and decided to check it out myself. Service was fast and didn't take long to get my order. The first bite was truly good and delicious! Never thought that it taste great since I only heard about it. Going to come back here again!
5	BEST FOOD TRUCK BAR NONE!not only is it truly inexpensive but the portions are huge! they will fill you up quite fast. love their pulled pork sandwich except the measly piece of lettuce.. i'd rather have coleslaw than an iceberg lettuce leaf.their turkey drumstick is pretty amazing too. definitely makes you feel like fred flintstone munching on that bone.
