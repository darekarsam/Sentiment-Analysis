1	Methinks not. Indeed.I'm not sure what was worse... feeling cramped up, having a bloody mess of my cuticles, or it taking two hours for a simple manicure? To top it off, the male manicurist kept leaving me, and finally, after having made a bloody mess of me, was replaced by a woman who finished up the job rather carelessly.I would've liked to forget the horrible experience, except that for the rest of the night, my fingers were swollen and throbbing.Never. Again.
