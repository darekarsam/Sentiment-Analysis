Technically, it's on the North end of Crystal Lake Park... so there's a lake nearby as well!It's probably one of the neatest (and educational) places in town to take your kids too! You can adopt a pet, walk around the Busey Woods trail, stop and smell all of the wonderful flowers, and they even have a cute little nature shop. It's almost like Meadowbrook Park - only better.
