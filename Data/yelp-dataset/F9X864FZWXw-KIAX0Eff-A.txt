4	I went to a baby shower yesterday and had their cake pops which were awesome. The vanilla one was the best. I liked the pink lemonade and lemon ball flavored. My friend who booked it, did business with the owner. She said the owner was a gem, delightful, and a pleasure to work with. Check it out for your next party.
5	Penni and Pinkalicious are GREAT! We had her cater/deliver in cake pops and cupcakes for a work dinner, and everything was so delicious! She was easy and delightful to work with, reasonably priced, delivered for us and an incredible baker! I would highly recommend Pinkalicious for your baking needs!
4	They still have the best cookies in the world! Lined up out the door when we visited. Enjoyed the chocolate brioche. Wish they sold cookie mix so I could enjoy this back home.
