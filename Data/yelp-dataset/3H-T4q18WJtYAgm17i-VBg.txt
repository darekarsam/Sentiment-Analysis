2	Went to take my 3 year old to get some stitches on his chin after a fall at day care. Maybe it was just this day but I have never been to a slower place 8 people in front of us.  1 hour 45 min waiting and the only called back 3 people.  3 familys also left in front of us.  When we told the nice young lady at the desk we were gonna have to go somewhrre else she sigh and acting like it was normal. Bathroom was dirty, no paper towels.  Only good thing was the front desk staff was nice and smiley..
