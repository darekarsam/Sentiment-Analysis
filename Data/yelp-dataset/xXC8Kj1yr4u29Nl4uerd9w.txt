5	the worship and teaching are both exceptional! the atmosphere is friendly and very welcoming to guests, i love it here.
5	This is the best church EVER. The worship is amazing. The message always captivates my heart. The community that has been built here is so amazing. Vineyard offers a free medical clinic, food bank, and community outreaches for those in need.I have never been so blessed!
5	Great church. Real people, excellent worship, practical preaching. Stay for prayer after and you will have an encounter with the Living God! If you come more than twice, then start going to a small group as that is where church really happens. Vineyard is for those who are tired of trying to be good, and ready to be GREAT! Vineyard is the radical middle, the perfect blend of biblical evangelical and social charismatic. If you thought God was dead, drop by to see His hands and feet at work.
