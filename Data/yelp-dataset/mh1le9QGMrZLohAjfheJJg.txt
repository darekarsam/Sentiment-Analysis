1	I was NOT impressed! The service was good...that's about it. The chicken sandwhich tasted like it had been left out a while before it was cooked...definitely not fresh!Their mashed potatos were good although they served it with sausage gravy which was unique. The cost was ok. Typical chicken place. The (women's) restroom wasn't cleaned very well and neither was the restaurant. Trying to find a clean table was not hard... only one amongst several messy tables. The only plus to the restaurant was the servers. They had smiles and treated us well. It was the first Bojangles I've been to and I was not impressed in the least.
2	They got that Chicken! It's like I'm sayin. Mash Potatoes! Biscuits, check! Gravy for that donkey! Correct Change? Nope!
3	Steak biscuit Mac and cheese  green beans but no sweet potatoes pie....Not sure what all the hype is about this joint??? Guess next time I gotta try the chicken ?!
2	The service at this location is really good, but on more than one occasion, the food that I've gotten hasn't been really good.  Many times the chicken seems to be cold and the sides appear to be a little old.  The customer service is great, my only complaint is that at lot of times they try to avoid giving you a bag and put all of your order in the box.  This isn't a bad thing, I just have a pet peeve about being given greasy napkins :)  It's a known fact that if you put the napkins in the box with the fried chicken, that the napkins are gonna be saturated with grease.Note:  The drive thru line can be a bit long on Sunday afternoons, so save yourself some time by going inside.
3	Food is pretty good. Always go during the day. The night shift is ratchet! Seriously! Very selfish with bags. They will try to stuff everything in one bag. Dining area is clean.
