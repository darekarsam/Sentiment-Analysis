5	Made my appointment online at 8am. Show up a few minutes before 8am and I'm out by 8:15am!! I cut in front of 2 people. I would recommend making an appt! The guy the took me back was nice and knew what he was doing. I don't like getting things taken out of me..they are inside for a reason :p But it didn't hurt. In and OUT! Great place since I have UHC! Make sure they take your insurance before getting there!
3	The office was pretty empty at 10:30 AM midweek, but I had made an appointment. They still took the other two people already sitting there first before me even though it was 10:30 and neither of them had an appointment. Only an extra 10 minute wait. The box where you put your valuables though was nasty and dirty and full of curly hairs. I have no idea how that got in the box. Of course I said something and she half cleaned it. Otherwise, a smooth process and  results came back in only three hours.
