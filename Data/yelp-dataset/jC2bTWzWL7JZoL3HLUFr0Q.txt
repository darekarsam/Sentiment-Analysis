5	I have gotten my hair cut and highlighted by Kelly Sargent since I was 15 - I'm 25 now, so it's been 10 years!, She always gives me a great haircut and highlights. I have thick hair that is hard to style, and she is a master at thinning it out while also giving me a great look. My highlights last for four months and grow out beautifully. I love going to Kelly to get my hair done, and I highly recommend her as a stylist. My twin sister also goes to Kelly and loves it. I always look forward to my appointments. Check out Kelly Sargent and All in Good Company - you won't be disappointed. :)
5	Kelly Sargent has been cutting my hair for about 20 years along with my 2 daughters.  When my hair started to grey she highlighted my hair and people have no idea that I have grey hair. My daughter has gotten highlights by Kelly that perfectly suit her coloring. I don't know how she does it but Kelly is the best color stylist I know. She also gives great cuts that compliment your face and hair type. I highly recommend her!
5	I have been going to Kelly Sargent at " All in Good Company" for quite some time and I am consistently happy with my hair cuts. I travel extensively for business and I have occasionally had my hair cut in NY, LA and Europe and found more often than not, other stylists do not "listen" to my requests to simply trim my hair. I always look forward to having Kelly cut my hair when I return, as I know she will do it "right". I love her work-the price is reasonable and the quality is superb!  Lecil Henderson
