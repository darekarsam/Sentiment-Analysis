1	My kids love Taco Bell, I love to take them here because it's cheap lol. Usually we go to the one down the road because every single time I come to this one, they always seem to either screw up the order, or short change all the food by stuffing it full of lettuce and barely any "meat" so do your self a favor, drive the extra couple miles to avoid this Taco Bell
5	Great food at a good value.
2	It's okay I don't have anything to say really the customer service is ok and the food is okay only had one bad experience where all of my tacos were crushed couldn't eat them with out a spoon it was horrible.
3	Went through the drive thru for a quick bite after a long day of travel. It was about 8:45pm and there didn't appear to be any other customers there. Don't think I had eaten at this location before tonight. I usually go to the one on McDowell. I got the cheesy potato burrito and ordered a few items from the dollar menu that my boyfriend wanted to try. Only took about a minute to get the food and I was on my way. When I got home, the burrito was still warm and tasted good. Lots of beef in there. It didn't look very big, but it was filling. My b/f said the mini shredded chicken quesadilla was good. Taco Bell isn't the greatest quality pseudo-Mexican food around, but where else can 2 people get dinner for 6 bucks?
