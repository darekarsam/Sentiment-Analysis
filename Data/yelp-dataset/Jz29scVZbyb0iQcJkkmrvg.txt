4	When they say mall, they mean it.  Every time I think I've found the last room, I find another.  There is a huge selection from kitschy housewares to oil paintings to glassware and dishes and earthenware to jewelry.  The highlights are the mid-century and Victorian furniture and the 1900s-80s clothing on the top floor.  The staff is ready to help, without feeling the need to follow customers around.  The prices ranged from reasonable to discounted.  Schedule at least 45 minutes if you want to see (almost) everything.

5	I love this place! There is so much to see that I could spend all day there! The prices are great and the staff are helpful and knowledgeable.  Just some of the highlights are mid century modern everything, old books, art pottery, jewelry, paintings, sculpture, military items, toys, furniture, photographs, old appliances, vintage clothes, on and on!  The parking situation is not great but it is worth it.
5	Not sure why my earlier review did not post. This place is fantastic! The staff is knowledgeable and pleasant.  Prices are reasonable and negotiable. I could spend a week there and never see it all. Military, pottery, mid- century everything, old toys, architectural relics, art work. On and on! The parking situation is not great but it's worth it.
5	Great! The best in the burgh
3	Friendly and helpful manager, great on negotiations, decent range of offerings. Store was messy, dirty and cold - there seemed to be almost no heating the day we were there and much of the inventory was so badly organized/arranged that it was a chore to browse. I went for specific items I'd seen advertised online, but this was overall a rather shabby place.
3	Not bad - a ton of stuff but nothing particularly high end.  Also, not very organized.  It was nice to visit but I don't think I'd make the trip again.
5	Great prices and sweet unique stuff!!! Would defiantly go back!!!!
2	Watch your step. Really. You trip in to the door, trip from room to room, and trip over items spewn over the floor. (How they get insurance is beyond me....)The items are housewares (lots) , jewelry, coins, and some military. One room had a selection of mid century furniture, but rough.There is little to no air conditioning, so consider this when the outside temps are above 90.
4	Several floors and so many rooms. I had a lot of fun exploring and will likely go back soon. Parking is very confusing. If you're driving by and you see a spot in the front, swing in fast to avoid being rear-ended, otherwise keep on driving past and hope for better luck next time. If there's a secret parking area I am not yet aware of it. Worth the trouble though!
5	love this place huge selection at medium prices, 3 stories, cool view of ohio river from attic.  mid century modern - vintage furniture,  kitchen, collectibles, toys,  xmas/halloween, clothes, vintage hats, tools, pictures, etc....   huge purple building on 65 ohio river blvd----------hidden parking lot behind on north side of building-----------becareful pulling in/out busy street
5	First time here- I had a blast! Great variety as well. I loved the flow of the store as well, it is in an old house. You will find everything from tacky porcelain statues of poodles to turn of the century stained glass. The prices were okay-- not great, just okay.
2	I've driven past this place many times and I stopped in today for the first time.  I really, really wanted to like it, but it just wasn't to be. Here's the good: The building is quite large (3 floors) and there are lots of interesting things to look at. The people working there are very friendly. Also, there may be some cool finds hidden among lots of crap. And the bad: The entire place is in disarray. It's absolutely filthy and smells weird. (Not musty, but weird.) While there are several floors to browse, most of the stuff being sold is overpriced and/or falling apart. The building itself is in shambles; it's crumbling. Also, the parking situation definitely isn't optimal, as it's located along the river side of Ohio River Boulevard.
