5	Dr Benson and staff have been taking care of my dogs for the past several years!! They are the best!!! Pat and Chuck Killen
5	If I could give 100 stars I would for Dr. Benson.  I live very far from Dr. Benson's office but I will drive there for my cat and have with my last cat, K.C.  He was the ONLY vet that took the chance to try to take blood from K.C. vs sedating a 17 yr. old cat.  Dr. Benson is very knowledgeable, conservative and I trust him more than any other vet.  I have tried several in AZ, and also in NV, and FL and no one compares to his expertise and patience. I will forever be grateful for his care and concern for K.C.  Now I have Cleopatra and will keep coming back to Dr. Benson no matter the distance!!  You will be glad you tried Dr. Benson!!
5	North Ranch animal hospital was recommended to me by a neighbor several years ago. They are the best!  Both Dr. Lewis  and Dr. Benson are excellent. They are caring,  thorough and explain all options. I've had many emergency issues with my dogs over the years and I was always able to get them in within an hour or two. Their prices are reasonable and I love that they are still an independent hospital that doesn't try to up sell me. Their staff is very knowledgable and  caring. When I got a new puppy, the staff encouraged me to bring her in anytime just for treats, a weigh-in and  socialization with the staff.
5	Dr. Benson and his staff are wonderful! We have been going here for over ten years, and they have always taken such good care of our fur babies. They have appointments every day except Sunday which is really nice if you work Mon-Fri. I would reccomend, and do reccommend North Ranch Animal Hospital to anyone and everyone looking for a good vet in this area. Even when we move out of the area we will still go here. Trust this place!
