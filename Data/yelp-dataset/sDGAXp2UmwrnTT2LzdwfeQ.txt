4	Was here to check out C2MTL, the new media festival organized by Sid Lee and Cirque du Soleil. It's a perfect space for this kind of crazy I think, with all kinds of flashing neon light patterns, exposed brick, central bars, opening up to outdoor areas by the canal in the back. The wifi wasn't up to the crowd of tech nerds in there today which was too bad, but the space is epic and lovely, if a little cold maybe, with great big rooms with nice acoustics and some serious light and sound. Easy walk from George Vanier metro.
4	how do you review a hangar?so i was here because of the chromeo and a-trak super secret concert sponsored by altered states molson and vice canada which is about putting musical acts in weird venue hence this place, commonly referred as the old shipyard.how's the place? can't really say as it was all white walls with beer stands left and right and a free AYCE section.i can say that the cell reception (as well as data) was perfect. no drops, no nothing.sound was really loud but then, with the crazy high ceiling, no wonder.what else can i say? chromeo being chromeo. still pumping out hits after hits and people go crazy wild. probably the only act that really makes me groove.concert was free, food was free, beer was free (limited to just 3), free coat check. plenty of security.in summary, depending on the event, the venue decor will reflect that.and if someone says old shipyard, you'll know they are talking about this venue
