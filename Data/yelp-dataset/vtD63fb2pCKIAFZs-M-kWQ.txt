5	Love this hospital. Quality everything A to Z.
5	Amazing place...treated my wife and I with utmost care during the birth of our child...made the entire experience special and personal.
5	My doctor sent me here to have a test done.  I wasn't sure what to expect because you tend to hear the horror stories of getting services done at a hospital.  Everything about my experience was top notch from the phone call making the appointment to the post appointment follow up.  When I made my appointment, I was given detailed instructions about not only the appointment but also about where to park and how to get to the area where the test would be done. I was told to arrive around 15 minutes early to fill out paperwork so I did.  It took me about 5 minutes to fill out the paperwork and they took me in almost exactly at my 9:30 appointment time.  The staff was friendly and courteous.  It was wonderful that the doctor explained every step of the test so I understood what was going on and what he was looking at.  The nurse was equally as friendly and informative.Overall, the service was better then I expected and I will no longer be hesitant if/when I have to make a return appointment.
