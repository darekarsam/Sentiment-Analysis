5	My son recently started taking boxing classes at Sonny's. I found out that they offered a chick boxing class. I really wanted to try it but I was afraid that I would not be able to do it and that everyone in the class would be way more physically fit than me. What I found was a great group of women and men. Some are very fit and others are like me. I'm getting a great workout every day in a super positive and supportive environment. Sonny encourages us to work at our own pace and to start out with lower weights/reps to prevent injury. One of the things I like best about this class is that I do push myself and it is really built on simple principles of work hard for the reward. I have seen some huge results from some of the other women who have been taking the class for a while and I am really looking forward to seeing where I am in a few months. After just a few weeks I am already noticing a difference in what I can do. Oh by the way it is super reasonably prices to take the class. You can either pay $5 for each class or a flat rate of $60 per month. Well worth it for what you get. Hope to see you there!
5	Great offer on groupon! The staff is very friendly. Although,  we were new we jumped right in to the routine. The instructor was very motivating and helpful. The gym was clean and it was fun it wasn't strict but it mad you push yourself. Great prices and family friendly.
1	I decided to check it out since I'd done boxing recreationally in the past. He said he'd train me, but he never did. I don't know if it was because I wanted to lift weight and do technique with him, but the bottom line is he never trained me. They don't have scheduled classes, at least for adults. To me the gym was mostly for women and boxers already established. Basically, he didn't keep his word. Through scheduled classes or personally. Don't waste your money unless your already in the sport.
