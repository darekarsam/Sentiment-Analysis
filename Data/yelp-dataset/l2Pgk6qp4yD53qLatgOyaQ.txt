5	This place is awesome, even better than Elvira's and the service is just as good.
1	Made a stop here before heading back aboard the Stennis. Service was horrible! There wasn't even staff here to seat me! I had to come inside by myself and even cook in the kitchen by myself! By far the worst service of any restaraunt I've ever been to.
5	First time dining here and it was awesome!! If you are looking for fresh Mexican food at a good price this is your place!! The servers were helpful, friendly, and professional!! The restaurant and bathrooms were very clean!!! Great spot in AJ!!!!
4	Good food and super reasonable prices! We were a pay of five and had 2 pitchers of margaritas, a kids drink with meals and the total was $48!!
5	What a great little gem, in the area for a meeting and one guy recommended this place. Not much to look at from outside BUT seated quickly and drinks and chips and salsa came quick. I really enjoyed the little fried tacos with the shredded beef. I am am going back later in the week to sample something else.
