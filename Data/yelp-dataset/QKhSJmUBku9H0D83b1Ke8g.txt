4	One review, are you joking?! This place is a wee beast!Set in the heart of Cowgate, it's a wee hipster hangout which is totally my bag. Loved everything about it. Nice gin, Innes and Gunn beer, pizza, corn dogs, Lego straw holders, a framed picture of Ken Dodd - off the wall and got its own identity.I was through for the Fringe so the focus was more on comedy than anything else, but the vibe was great - chilled out but vibrant - good tunes, good people and nice bar staff. Can't argue with it!
