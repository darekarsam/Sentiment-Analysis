5	Very positive first experience with Dr. Hom and the rest of her staff.  If there is a more bubbly receptionist in town, I haven't met her.  It took about 2 weeks to get in for a first (routine) appointment.  I was directed to the forms online, so I downloaded and completed sign-up papers before I arrived.  That was helpful since I was able to research all the details at home rather than scrambling for them on the day of my first visit.  Usually, the later in the day an appointment, the farther behind things have become, but I went in about 15 minutes after my scheduled time, which I felt was pretty good for a mid-day appointment.  I didn't even have time to play on the Wii setup in the waiting room.  X-rays and cleaning were both handled quickly while I listened to the Discovery channel, which was playing on the TV at the end of my exam chair.  The hygienist was wonderful.  She has mastered the art of 1-way communication, so I wasn't expected to explain anything with a mouthful of instruments and fingers.  After all the photos were taken and my teeth were polished, Dr. Hom came in for a look around.  After declaring me cavity-fre, she took time to talk to me about my teeth.  She is very personable and not rushed at all.  Based on my experience, I highly recommend this team.
1	Dr. Hom may have been in a bad mood today, but she was very rude. The whole visit, she was rude. I will not be going back there. She did fillings (more than one) and I called when the numbing was wearing off because it hurts really bad and they say they can't even give me anything for the pain, not even ibuprofen??? No way I will go back here. The assistant was late again. And Dr. Hom told me they can't do a filling on my front tooth after she told me I could at my last visit. Very unprofessional
