5	This is my ultimate hidden gem sushi bar. It used to be attached to a gas station/hairdresser (don't ask!) but now, due to demand, have moved to a MUCH better location near DQ.Pros- CHEAP (how's $10 for 22 pcs for ya?)- Tasty sushi with quality ingredients (spicy sauce & that crunchy crap is highly recommended)- Made to order (not like that sushi shop garbage that's been sitting in the fridge all day)- Lots of Hello Kitty swagCons- 1 table to sit (this is pretty much a takeout place)- The owner isn't Japanese (As I walk out she wishes me a happy Chinese new year and gave me a candy...d'oh!)- UPDATE: This last con was really just to deliver a joke. Flavor and service are the only languages I care about when it comes to restos and Sushi Belle is fluent in both :)Comments:Always call ahead (20 min) to give the lady a chance to prepare so you're not stuck waiting
5	For a quick and cheap take-out sushi meal, I would highly reccomend Sushi Belle. This is by far the best sushi I have tried in the price range. 22 pieces for $10! The sesame sauce and spicy mayo are excellent.  The owner is very friendly and always there. And like the previous reviewer said, you should call in your order so you don't have to wait.
5	I've been a customer for Sushi Belle since it first opened next to a hairdresser and a gas station and will remain loyal until ither I move away to another country or die, but this place is the best. Angel is an amazing woman and a hard worker, she makes awesome sushi and I recommend it to anyone who's looking for a great meal at a great price. We love you Angel.
4	Decent price, good value, quick service. A bit too much rice in rolls and some not quite tight enough.  Overall a very good experience.
