5	Dr Johnson is wonderful!  He takes his time, answers all of my questions, is extremely friendly and doesn't yell @ me for not taking out my contacts.  I've been going to him for years and have referred several friends who also like him.  It's the only doctors appt that I happily make every year.
5	Just saw Dr. Johnson yesterday for a eye problem. His staff got me in right away. Dr. Johnson was very thorough and answered all my questions. Also, he offered two different prescriptions to accomodate my insurance coverage. Very great experience. Would definately recommend him.
5	Dr. Johnson was on our insurance list, so called for yearly check up for myself and husband. Got an appointment the same week at convenient time for working husband. Dr. Johnson was a treat! Knowledgable and very thorough. Explained every movement of his exam. Staff very pleasant and helpful. So happy to have found the office.
5	Professional, friendly, laid back office staff and doctor. They didn't seem to mind I had to bring my baby with me as well today & she was kinda wiggly so I had to hold her during my eye exam. Definitely will be recommending this office.
5	I've been seeing Dr Johnson since he was with Eye Masters at the Galleria Mall. Always has been professional, knowledgable and accomodating all these years to myself, my son and my significant other. Best of all, Dr. Johnson has a sense of humor! I had a severe eye infection yesterday, called in and his wonderful staff squeezed me in even though they were over booked with back to school appointments. I've recommended him to several friends many times over. We'll keep seeing him for years to come.
5	My coworker recommended Dr. Johnson and wow, what an expert!  He takes his time, but studies everything about your vision.  He is respectful and the office is sweet and return calls promptly.
