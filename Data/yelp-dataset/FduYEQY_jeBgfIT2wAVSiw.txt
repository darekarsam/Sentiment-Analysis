2	Ideal location near the Interstate and it's also on the Charlotte bus routes. The shopping plaza where this McD's is located is extremely busy and there is constant traffic of people driving past to get to Wal-Mart or Lowe's, so keep an extra special eye out for that.Because it's so busy, I find that this isn't the cleanest of McDonalds restaurants. I've spotted a dirty restroom on more than one occasion and trays remain on the tables.
4	Fastest and friendly-est fast-food service I have ever had!I work down the road from here at TWC. I was in and out within 5mins during lunch rush:)
1	This McDonald's is consistent, in that it will ruin your morning every time. They have a double drive thru that there  was apparently zero training for.  This morning I pulled up to the speaker and before anyone said anything to me the other Lane took 3 orders. Then they charged me for the wrong order. Then they mistook my request for 'No Onions please' has 'Only onions please', Even though by the time i got it I had repeated my order several times.  Then wanted me to pull over and wait while they figure it out. .. And trust me this is a typical breakfast run here.
