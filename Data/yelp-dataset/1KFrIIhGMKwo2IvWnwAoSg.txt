3	We usually do take-out from Chows and this is a pretty good indicator of the quality of the food, I find.  My General Tao chicken was terrific; not little nubs of batter with a hint of chicken inside.  The General Tao consisted of large pieces of chicken, fried perfectly and the sauce was a perfect blend of sweet and of spicy.  I was a little disappointed with the chow mein, it lacked flavour.  The egg rolls were crunchy and the cabbage was fresh.  The pineapple chicken was delicious and there was a row over who would have the last piece.  The garlic spareribs were also very good, the meat was not tough in the least.  The rice was good if a bit average.
2	I ordered her today for lunch at work, I ordered the general Tao chicken, and asked for it SPICY.  I guess that means they just add a packet of hot sauce to your order because the sauce was anything but spicy.  On the plus side they use real chicken and nice big chunks.  Not like some places that that are a 1/4 chicken and 3/4 batter.  The thing that will prevent me from ordering there again is they don't do a General Tao sauce to my liking.
4	My personal go to fast food chinese buffet. $8 for all you can eat lunch special. Good selection. Place is dated and food quality so so. But price can't be beat. Egg rolls are the best I've ever had. General Tao is good, and they even have deep fried spare ribs, which I have not found any where else. Not a place to bring a date! Service is fast and friendly. Located on dorval Ave, adequate parking in the back. Have had take out , but prefer the buffet. Dessert selection is ok , but I don't go for the desserts. Supper is about $12. Good crowd on Sunday's, which is the cheapest day for the lunch buffet.
