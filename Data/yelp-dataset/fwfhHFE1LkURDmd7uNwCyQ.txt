4	This is a great PNC location if you're in Southside. The staff is very friendly, and I've never had to stand in a long line. We've opened up new accounts here, done standard transactions, and had cashier's checks cut here. All with minimum fuss. There's also an ATM outside if you're looking for a PNC ATM during off hours.I definitely prefer this location to the other SS location on 18th & Carson. Less people in the bank, and less people outside of the bank asking you for money when you leave.
5	This is the best bank branch in the city.  Yes, they're part of the PNC giant but the staff here are just a great bunch.  We bank here for our business and they really are nice and they know me by name.   Josh and Andy are always helpful and unlike every other bank they turnover is low.All in all the only PNC I will go into.
