1	Pros : nice atmosphere Cons: slow service, bad server attitude, bad foodI'm my opinion your better off heading to Carson and going to one of the many bars there that can provide quality food with quality service.
1	good cheap wings on certain nights but turns into hip hop ghetto weirdness at night/weekends.   this is one of those places where white females go to hook up with black males .  you get my drift .
1	Service?  What service?  From the moment you enter this place you begin to wonder about your personal health and safety.  After hundreds of times driving by this place, some friends and I decided to stop in for the Tuesday wing night, and we left with the opinion that none of us would ever be making a return visit.  I'm not sick YET, but I guess we'll have to find out what the morning brings.  YOU CAN DO BETTER in this neighborhood, so don't expect much more than a crappy beer poured out of a questionable tap system into a partially-cleaned glass.  And if you're getting something to eat, say a few Hail Marys first.  (Actually, you'd be better off going half a mile down the street and getting a Fiori's pizza to go!)
4	The black and gold wings are my favorite.  They have good tacos too. They have one barmaid with a stink attitude so I dont deal with her (long dark strait hair...thin frame) the other lady is very nice. They need to do better with the bathroom otherwise the place is a good time.
5	Best chicken in Pittsburgh.  Better than wings over Pittsburgh and ugly dog.  Great service!!!
1	Inconsiderate patrons, I've witnessed them harassing people who live nearby. Have seen customers walk out with drinks no employees stop them then proceed to throw them in homeowner' yard's. Very surprised this place hasn't been shut down yet.
