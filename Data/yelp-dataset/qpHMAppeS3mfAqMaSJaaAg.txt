5	My friend asked me to go to a meeting with her and her attorneys for emotional support. She was accused of neglecting her kids by her ex. These guys know their stuff. One of the attorneys used to represent CPS and they quickly came up with a great plan to explain that the truth that this was just her ex being an ass. If I ever have any problems I am definitely going to them first.
5	Gregg is a great attorney! He's extremely knowledgeable with the law, gets great results, and keeps the line of communication open throughout the whole case. I would recommend you choose Mr.Gregg Woodnick as your criminal defense attorney.
5	I can't say enough good things about Gregg Woodnick and his staff. They were friendly, courteous, professional and responsive to every need. They went above and beyond to help solve my child custody issue. I could not be happier with the service Gregg provided. If it weren't for him and his staff, I would not have the outcome that I have today. I would recommend them to anyone.
