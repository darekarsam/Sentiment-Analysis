3	This place was very bland but cheap. I made the mistake of getting a potato when apparently the cheesesteaks are where its at. Will I be back? Probably.just to try a cheesesteak!
2	Took my wife to this place, located at the food court inside Galleria Mall. It's been around since the mall first opened so I figured it must be good, but what a surprise I got. The food was expensive, not very tasty and the person at the register talked on the phone for about a minute before he took my order. My wife was not impressed, nor was I and we won't be going back.
4	Yum the great steak n coney fries - can't go wrong! They were out of ice tea which saddened me, had to order soda which I hate to drink.
