5	Great place! I use it more as a take away. Go buy some fresh pasta and any of their sauces, then invite some friends over and lie to them and tell them you made it all;)
4	As an Italian, I eat way too much pasta. I was a bit skeptical trying out a place that makes "fresh pasta" since we do it fresh at home but this place is definitely worth your time and money. The pasta is very fresh, the sauces are quite tasty and the people working there are super helpful. I would suggest this place if you're having guests over and want to make something super quick and good!
