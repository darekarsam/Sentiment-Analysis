5	The eponymous steak sandwich might be the best sandwich I've ever had.  Perfect contrast among hot sauce, avocado, steak, and cheese; the bread was fresh and the service fast.

3	We had some empendas (chicken), a Barros Luco sandiwch and a hot dog...My suggestion: skip the hot dog...I thought guacamole on a hot dog would be an awesome combination. It wasn't.But the rest was pretty good.  Plus you get to see them make the sandwich  at the counter and all the food was piping hot. If you are in the area and need a cheap good meal, it's definitely an option.
4	Great little place for a Barros Lucos, the bread is uniquely sweet and the fillings which include steak, avocado, and cheese is just perfect.  Among the other must try items are their caramel dessert (everything is made in house) or their special of the day like todays fried fish with rice.  The people who own it are super friendly and while it's a no fills whole in the wall, your sure to find something you will love.
