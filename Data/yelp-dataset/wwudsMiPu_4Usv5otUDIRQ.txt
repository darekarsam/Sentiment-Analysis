4	As a university student near this place, le boucherie de paris has exactly what I'm looking for: a variety of sandwiches, cheap price, and fast service. I prefer this place over the more expensive chain bakeries on Cote Des Neiges. The place is quite small, but don't be set back by the lineups that can extend outside their doors. They have a good setup in which they can whip up to-order sandwiches in a near industrial fashion. My favourite sandwiches are the Pate, jambon et fromage sandwich, or the rillettes sandwich. A parisian friend told me that this is one of the first places in montreal where she found french imported cookie brands.

They're extremely good. I have friends who are French and absolutely love these plates... it's a it of a reminder of what they left. They're pretty happy when they get to eat a meal like those. The prices are really fair and the staff is absolutely lovely.
