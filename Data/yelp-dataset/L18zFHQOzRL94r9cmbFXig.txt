5	My son passed away in 2007, and they were very compassionate and helpful. We ordered an urn for him and picked it up and thought everything was fine with it. Recently, we noticed that my son's birthdate was wrong on it, so I called them on the phone and they not only apologized, but they replaced the urn for free and made it so that we could pick up the new urn near where we live now. I would recommend them to anyone looking for awesome customer service.
5	I have nothing but good things to say about Mariposa Gardens.  Not only is the cemetery beautiful and intimate, but the staff was so kind, compassionate and helpful as we made funeral arrangements for our son.  The staff went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect.  Thank you Amanda, Lonna and An'drea for helping us during this difficult time.
1	My Mom died in July 2014. She had already made the arrangements.  We paid immediately when making the final arrangements. Mariposa Gardens cashed the check the next day and it had cleared the bank.  October, I received a call from Judy who works at Mariposa Gardens that we had closed the account and the check bounced.  I told her to have the bookkeeping dept call me.  No one called.  A few days later I found out they turned the account into collections.  The collection agency was called and reported that we DID pay in full.  No one at Mariposa Gardens has called and apoligized for this huge mistake.
