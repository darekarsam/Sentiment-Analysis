2	This has got to be the slowest pace to eat ever! Sat in the drive thru for 20 min and the line never moved.  At least another 8 cars ahead of us.  Pulled out and left.  If you have a ton of time to kill the milkshakes are great.
1	3 out of 4 times I try to come here I end up leaving without buying anything. The drive through is a complete joke. The absolute slowest moving line I've ever experienced.
2	I wish this wasn't the closest sonic to my house, because I get a craving for cranberry limeades on a regular basis...and unfortunately, a trip to this location is NEVER under 15 minutes. It doesn't matter if you use the drive thru or the drive in option...the wait is always horrendously long. I've even tried going in a different times of the day, hoping for a change, but it is to no avail.On a good note, they do make the limeades well...must be what's taking so long! :)
2	The slowest sonic of my life. Friendly staff, but I was in the drive-through with only two cars in front of me and I was in line for at least 20 minutes. Super frown.
