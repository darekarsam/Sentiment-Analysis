4	Great place to see up-in-coming artists while they are still students at ASU. No entry fee, but drop something in the donation jar.
5	This quaint, hound-themed night gallery is a great display of local artists' work and the wide mixture of media and take on the canine spirit is fantastic. Even though it only took us 20 minutes to walk through, admire, and discuss the different pieces, it was a fun way to support local artists. When I went, there were even 2 pieces with which the viewer could interact!
