4	It's a gas station. It's clean. They have gas. Decent selection of drinks in the coolers.
5	Extremely friendly staff! Super clean store!Gas is expensive but they can't really control that.Grab a sandwich from the deli are good. Nothing but kudos to this location, I would actually drive out of my way for the service.
