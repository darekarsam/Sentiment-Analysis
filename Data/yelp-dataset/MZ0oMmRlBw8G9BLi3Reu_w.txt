5	I am currently a customer of Mike Miller and I have never been so happy to have an insurance agent that treats me like family.  This office in particular has the best staff around and always give me a warm greeting when I walk in or call.  They have a variety of beverages to offer customers and sometimes have treats available.  There is also a room filled with awesome kids toys to keep the children entertained while getting whatever work done that is needed as a customer.  I would recommend Mike Millers office out of any other agent in Arizona or surrounding areas!  I highly recommend switching your insurance needs over to this office you wont be disappointed.  Usually insurance agents are not personable and rarely in the office however Mike is there whenever I need him to be and has amazing producers to get the job done in a timely manner!
5	Great service and super friendly staff. Very family friendly office as well (there is a kids room with toys and such to keep the kids entertained during your visits to the office). Mike and his team are incredibly professional and cover a wide range of services. I would definitely recommend him to all your insurance needs!
5	Best insurance group to be part of!!! great rates for my entire family and I even saved money on my home insurance. I highly recommend it to everyone.
1	No customer service.  Worst insurance experience ever. Great service getting you signed up; after that they don't care at all. This is not based on a single experience.  Use a different agent if you want more than someone just taking you money.  Mike, feel free to return my call.
