3	Been to this location once. I would come back. I ordered the NY hot dog. It's 100% beef with sauerkraut, spicy mustard and fried onions. I love sauerkraut. The service was okay. I had to tell the order taker my order a few times. And the person who brings out the food threw away my receipts so I made him dig them out the trash because he just assumed that I didn't want them. The food was hot. They didn't give me enough ketchup packets for my onion rings though. Typical fast food place with areas they can improve in with appropriate feedback.
1	I gave this place a 2nd chance for breakfast. Apparently, when you ask for not tomatoes you get them anyways. :-/ I'm never going back there again
1	This location sucks.Always takes forever, drive thru or pull in.The master blasts are never blended. Bottom half is always just plain ice cream.Worst sonic in the valley.
3	I like Sonic and this one isnt too bad.  Always seem to get my order right, decently fast.  My issue is why do all Sonics stack the burgers sideways??!!  They're all messed up by the time I get home.  If youvre going to stack them sideways then bring them out sideways and hand it to me sideways!!!  Otherwise stack the damn burger perpendicular to the bag!  And get rid of the natural cut fries.  All other restaurants have tried them and ditched them already.  Catch up Sonic.
1	So slow! Not sure what the issue is with this location but they need help. I've been on 2 different occasions and both times they took forever. The food is fine but next time I have a sonic blast craving I may have to think of an alternative.
