4	This is one of my go to fish purveyors.  The prices are a little on the higher range but it absolutely reflects the quality.  I do believe that they supply a number of sushi restaurants and that is why they still have huge turnover of high end products.  The service is really good and they know their products, and are knowledgeable in how to prepare what they sell in many different ways.  The place is rather small and can easily be overlooked so it is worth seeking out and you will be happy you did.
5	A very nice place with very fresh products. Agreed, it's a bit more pricey but quality is outstanding... I feel price / quality ratio is way better these Metro and Provigo on Parc ave.Very small... I guess that fits totally the definition of an hidden gem.
