4	Great office location. You never have to wait all that long to see your doctor. I don't think I've ever been here longer than an hour (except for the surgery of course). Great Staff throughout office. Dr Grondel is great. Repaired my ACL and put together a great recovery plan. Couldn't be happier to be playing basketball again!
