5	A special thank you to the crew at Devious Designs. Great customer service and the scallop graphics on my van came out beyond my expectations. The graphic options were first emailed to me followed up by visiting the shop for a final approval, followed by yet another email showing the final design on my van. I highly recommend Danny and his crew at Devious Designs.
5	Best of the best!!! Great service and great work... I wouldn't take my car any other place than devious designs...
5	Had a small RV project done at the shop, on time and on budget. Is this really a Vegas paint shop?? Highly recommended.Mike
5	I took my car here after being referred by a trusted friend. I had to fix the front bumper to my car and some other things but couldn't go through insurance therefore had to keep the cost low. Keith took his busy time to make multiple calls to his suppliers in order to find the lowest cost. And he was very busy! I still wanted a decent looking job and expected a less than perfect fix since I was fixing on a budget. However not only did Keith explain the different options thoroughly, I found he was such a perfectionist and made my car look brand new!!! I payed $1100 where as was quoted anywhere from $1800-$2800. I ALSO got my car fixed in one day. If your looking for a fair down to earth body shop who is a perfectionist, this is your place. Thanks Keith and everyone at Devious designs!
