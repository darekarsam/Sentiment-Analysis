5	Great haircut for $12.
4	Open Tuesdays - Saturday 8:30a - 5:30p, Find it on the second floor in the El Cortez Casino (entrance adjacent to sports book)$12 - Cut$15 - Shavecash only - walkin onlyBest deal in Las Vegas.If your in the mood for an old school barber and to meet a genuine individual, stop by to see Ernesto in his barber shop.  He's been doing it for over 20 years, the last 9 in a little corner of the El Cortez.  Master craftsmanship, genuine personality, honest business owner.  He's got an unpretentious shop, doesn't use technology (why should he), and mad skills with the scissors and blade.  Sure I could have paid 40 cents for a bic and done the job in about 2 minutes, but the experience of my first straight razor cut was like stepping back in time, relaxing and rewarding.You can probably find a better "experience' at Mandalay Bay or some other joint but you'll also pay more than twice the price and will not have met Ernesto!So next time you are downtown, get a shave dammit!  It's a lost art and you'll be sad you missed out on it.
2	I was in the area so I went in for a shave after hearing some good things about this place. Supposedly it's a hidden gem in Vegas. I was less than pleased with the shave. No pre-shave oil, lukewarm towel, barber doesn't pull the skin tight which leads to numerous cuts, when he touched up parts of my face he didn't re-lather which means razor burn is going to happen...after all of that I get out of the chair to see half of my neck still had hair on it and my side burns were about an inch off from each other. If you're looking for a cheap place near downtown this may be your place, if you're looking for a great shave look elsewhere. I'll gladly pay $25-50 off the strip somewhere to get an enjoyable shave next time.
