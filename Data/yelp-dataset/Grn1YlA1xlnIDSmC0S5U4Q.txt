5	Have used three different stylists here and each one gave me a perfect haircut.  I'm moving to another town and will still come back to get my hair cut here.
5	Everybody in my family goes here, and are always very happy with the results. Karen has been doing all of us for about a year now....she is pretty darn awesome at what she does! But to be fair I think all of the ladies here can handle whatever your needs be.The place itself is very nice, modern, and super clean. I would say he prices are average...I have yet to cringe at a bill (even when my wife has her color done)Bottom line.... I cannot recommend this place enough...top notch people doing top notch work at a good price.
5	Not having had a real haircut in years I was incredibly apprehensive about going, but Karen did a fantabulous job. I look 15 years younger and feel like I need to buy new clothes to match my wonderful hair!! The only minor complaint I have is the window says walk-ins are welcome, but no one was available until an hour later. If I didn't live so close, that may have prevented me from returning. What a travesty that would have been!!
