1	This company pulls the old bait and switch. They quoted us $.25 per sq' foot for grout cleaning and then tried to charge us $1.29 for the job! They technician unloads all of his equipment in your home, does a little sample area and then jacks up the price. When you complain he calls his boss and then haggles with you acting as a go between between you and his boss on the phone. He would not leave. It took me almost an hour to make him leave. He kept lowering the price (just a little) insisting he would lose his job if he didn't get the work. He finally put me on the phone with his boss and I told the boss to tell him to leave. While I was talking to the boss, the technician was pleading with my husband and finally offered to do the job "off the books" since we were his last stop of the day. He used every kind of manipulation possible. That is an hour of my life I won't get back! Imagine my surprise when I looked them up and saw the same behavior from them with other customers about carpet cleaning.  This company runs a scam. Avoid them.
1	So bad that words fail me. First of all, $69 for 4 rooms became $459. After 15 minutes of haggling and a "call to the boss", I got it down to $189. The end result was horrible....he worked for 2 hours and it looked like he didn't even use shampoo. I had to browbeat the guy to get on his knees and pick up the debris he left behind, and it STILL looked bad. This one might result in a credit card arbitration. Unbelievably horrible.
