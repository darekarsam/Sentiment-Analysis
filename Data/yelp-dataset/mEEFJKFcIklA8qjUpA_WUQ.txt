4	Typical jack in the box.  Clean.  Staff is friendly.  Drive thru open 24 hours.  They have the self-serve kiosk, which means you can get free tacos from time to time.Personal favorites include:egg nog shake during the holiday seasontacosultimate cheeseburger
3	Got the waffle breakfast sandwich, it was ok.  Make sure you get a pack of syrup.  It gets really messy!  DONT EAT AND DRIVE!
1	On Thursday, 5/8/14, I ordered chicken nuggets, fries, and mini-churros from this Jack In the Box. I got the worst food poisoning. I had to go to the ER, and that is the first time I have been there in 20 years. I would stay away from this restaurant.
4	I had no idea that jack in the box had cronuts! Well I never really understood the hype since I'm not much of a donut lover but I've been craving something sweet so it seemed perfect. Basically it's a croissant in the shape of a donut, covered in cinnamon sugar. It's actually really good and a cheap alternative that you can get 24/7. Don't knock it til you try it.
