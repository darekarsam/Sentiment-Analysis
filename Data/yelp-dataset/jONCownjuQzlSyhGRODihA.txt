4	Great fish and chips in Montreal. I was going to say best but I recently tried the ones at McLean's Pub on Peel downtown and like them more. The joint is tiny, so you'll probably want take-out.
5	They've been in business for YEARS and now I know why!! I am not a big fan of fish and chips. I find them generally super greasy, way too much batter and over cooked. Not at Mommy's! Not only that- but only $5.80 for 1 piece of fish with fries and coleslaw? Merci!! I think they need to do something about the coleslaw, but I doubt many are complaining :) Even better, they are right on the canal so you can pop over to a picnic table on the water and enjoy :)
4	Don't expect anything fancy, it's a real hole in the wall. This place has been in business since the early 70s and I understand why. Food : amazing. I absolutely love it. Their specialty is fish n chips and you can taste the Scottish authenticity. I hadn't gone in over 5 years, yet I did not taste any difference.Decor : reality is, there is none. Some posters of Scotland, but that's it. Note : they are located on the waterfront. I always go pick up my food and eat on the beautiful and scenic view of the waterfront. I suggest you do the same.
1	Went to Mommy's for the first time since last year...after tasting the fish, I knew right away that it was no longer the same owners or recipe, it was dry, hard and quite frankly horrible, it threw it in the garbage.  Did some research to find out that the business was taken over by someone else who has notable reduced the quality of the product that was being offered to customers for so many years!  Will never go back!!!  It is a sad end to what was an amazing fish and chip experience!
