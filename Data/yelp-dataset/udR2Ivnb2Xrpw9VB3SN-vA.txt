5	I have used Custom Water Refining the past 7 years.  He (Terry) installed the reverse osmosis and water softener in my new house (under Pardee Homes contract).  I have always found him extremely reliable, fair-priced, and very good at what he does.  Great service.
5	I used them for over 2 years and then I moved and didn't need them.  I am re subscribing to them, have recommended them to several friends who continue to Thank Me for  getting them to Terry.  Whoever Lil F. is, is either a person who can't be satisfied or just someone who loves to write bad reviews.  Terry is great and the system is "awesome"
