3	was disapointed with my last visit to Canaillesused to be one of my fav BYOW (i can walk to the resto) but did not like the "new" shorter menu; nothing was eye-popping, jaw-droppingthe food was ok, but a 14$ appetizer of sweet breads that has only 3 small pieces that are not too tender... the rest of the food was good (they always have good tartares) surprinsingly the service was average, our waiter seemed to be way over his head and seemed to not appreciate the fact that we were speaking French and ENGLISH at our table...) (he actually was gone by the time we finished our meal!!) thank God, the other waiter who attented to us later was WAY better and friendlier.it seems as if Canailles feels the pressure of a new BYOW restaurant opening soon in the area... i feel he changed his menu, lowered the prices (wich should be a good news!) but the quality was lowered too...will probably give it another try, but i feel i've been too many times and maybe it's time to move on...
4	A great BYOW experience. At Canailles you can enjoy a great meal at a reasonnable price (other "fancy" BYOBs tend to charge way too much for their entrees). The foie-gras burger is to die for. It is a huge hamburger. With a huge piece of foie gras inside the patty. OMG. Quality food, good service, cheap wine, rince, repeat.
4	We went with a bunch of friends.Overall I liked it and worth a try.Had the ducky dumpling as an appetizer : amazing!!The beef for dinner was too raw, thing is they did not ask for a cooking preference.. So it ranger from medium rare to medium. Too bad i don't like blood in my plate, but my friend switched her plate with mine and it was great then! It was very tasty.Desert was ok.Food price for three meal course and byow (40$) though they did the billing wrong and we had to point it out.
