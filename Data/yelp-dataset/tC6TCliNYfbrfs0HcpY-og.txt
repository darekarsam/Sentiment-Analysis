1	If I could give 0 stars I would. Unprofessional. Pretty much a scam. They would take advantage of you if you don't know what the problem is. Horrible horrible people. Stay away.
5	I would highly recommend them.  Installed exactly what I wanted in a professional manner.  The price was very fair compared to others, and the work was done professionally.  I watched the whole installation, and was impressed.
5	Advanced Garage Door Service was probably one of the best experiences I have encountered with a repair service.  I was given prices for potential problems with the garage door opener, not told an hourly cost or an initial service charge fee like other companies. After Mark came out and replaced the part at the price quoted I even received a follow up call from Joel the owner  to make sure everything was completed to my satisfaction. They are the best!Thanks ,Mark Rosin
