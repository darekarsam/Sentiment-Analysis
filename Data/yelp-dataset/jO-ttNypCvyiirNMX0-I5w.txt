4	This place is actually a little better than you'd expect, and I'm not just saying that because I used to have an uncle named Ned Kelley.  Nothing incredibly original, and the Aussie theme is a kind of silly, but they make good food.   Ribs, steaks, sandwiches, and some of my favorite salads.  Dessert is very rich but split it and you'll be happy - there's this sinful number called a skillet cookie, a chocolate chip cookie baked in a skilled, served hot with ice cream.  Once a year, no more than that.  The service is friendly and efficient, and the dining room is comfortable.
4	Ned Kelly's is your normal steak house. I had a very good Filet here once though! The bread they bring you before the meal is great along with a nice fresh salad! The best part of the whole place is the skillet cookie-I highly suggest ordering this while dining here!
