3	love the place only problem is the staff very rude!
3	Okay, I am going to start off by saying the actual expertise of the person who did my brows the few times I have gone here so far was great. That is not why the 3 star rating. The store they have rented, and work out of, looks HORRIBLE!!! If you go there you will know what I mean. That is the ONLY reason for the -2 stars.The service though? They make my brows look awesome. I don't like to wax anymore because after experiencing threading, I feel that my skin is a LOT less irritated and red after (if at all), with the same result - beautiful brows!
5	This place was great! Ask for Sasha. Me and my mom went there and we were done so quick. The place that I had went to before made my eyebrows too thin and uneven. So I had to let my eyebrows grow back and thankfully Sasha made them look nice again. It's not a bad price either. It's $10 for the eyebrows and $5 for the lip. But they always have specials going on like 3 sessions for $20.
5	Go see malika  she is great always listens to what I want and every time does an excellent job!! I had my eyebrows done by Sasha before and they were horrible I started going to malika and she fixed them for me... Love her work
5	Wanted to try this place out since it was on the way home and I was quite pleased. Malica was the one who did my eyebrows and she did amazing! She is a very sweet worker! She did it pretty fast and it didn't turn out bad at all. Definitely going back!
5	Neelu now does my eyebrows now! She is very nice and friendly. You tell her exactly what you want and she does it! Doesn't rush and takes her time. Which is why my eyebrows always come out nice ! And it's by my house!
