2	Two and a half stars.  It's nice to see that this Wendy's is still open.  When I lived in Greenfield, my friends and I would come here a couple of times a month.  I've always liked Wendy's better than McDonald's or Burger King--but that ain't sayin' much.   I'd always order off the value menu because I liked a baked potato and butter (instead of fries) and a side salad with my burger.  I've only been back here on rare occasion since I got married, but when I do, I still like the value menu.
3	It is a wendys. Clean pretty quick and consistent. Not much else I could ask for from a wendys
1	I do not normally review fast food joints but the employees here are sooo terrible and rude. More than once I've been given the wrong order then I get attitude and told that's not what I said. Ummm, I order the same thing every time, side salad and fries so don't tell me that I ordered a hamburger when I've been a vegetarian for 13 years.
1	Horrible service and food. Not what Dave Thomas created or expected.
1	Do you like waiting 30 minutes for fast food? If you do then this is your place! There is usually little veto no lines in this place but you will always have to wait for the simplest orders.  The cashiers are always screwing around on their phones which they have laying on the register in full view. The place sucks.  Drive over the bridge and get chic film a because their service is much better and you don't have to hear employees swearing or using racial slurs.
