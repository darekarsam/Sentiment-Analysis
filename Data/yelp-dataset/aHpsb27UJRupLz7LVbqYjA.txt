5	No reviews? Maybe the regulars at this place aren't too keen on electronic gadgets and social media? That would be my guess - because this bar deserves a few ratings at least! Good ones! Yes, it's like a lower end PTs or like an even older Crown and Anchor, but there is no mistaking the tough around the edges bartenders (who are nice) and the atmosphere of drink, drink, drink, smoke and gamble. What else is there for a bar in Vegas? No frills - but very comfortable. I lost $40 on the poker machine going for a Royal Flush...I had 4 beers trying! Totally worth it!!
5	Best bartenders in town! Very friendly and comfortable place to drink and gamble! Best kept secret in Vegas! Awesome kitchen too!
