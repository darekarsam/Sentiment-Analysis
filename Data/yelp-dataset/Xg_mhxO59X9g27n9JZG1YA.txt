5	Nice place / staff is great & Sheila is very sexy !  Mike 187
1	Drug dealers hanging around the dumpsters, cars of people parked waiting for their connections, Broken security gates, Pool heater broken longer than the gates have been not working, Palm trees not trimmed, paint falling off the stair rails, Manager who rents to all types of trash.These are only some of the problems associated with Paridise Foothills apt. This place is running down fast, the pools need to be re done, cool deck thats now hot deck. slimy landscaping,  Pool heater broken and the list goes on...Laundry room is very run down and over  120 degrees in the summer, of course they lock the doors to keep the run down laundry room safe.Even the fountain out by the mail boxes is broken at the top. The low life owner must be turning this place into Section 8 HUD or something is very wrong here!Im very happy my lease is up and I can get away from this run down dump.Please dont rent here unless you are a drug dealer and you must supply your own HOODIE!
1	There has been over 100 calls for Police Emergency Service to this apartment complex. The other day, my neighbors car was broken into. I called the office and the Manager told me she is not the Police, and the gates are not there for security. I guess every day when I have to stop and punch in a code it's just for fun. The manager is not very bright, she defends and lies to cover for the lack of security around her. She is renting to all sorts of low life just to fill up the place, the place is a dirty dump because she is renting to crap who live dirty. The Management here take zero responsibility for the way the place looks, how bad the pool area looks and the disgusting laundry rooms. I have no respect for the Manager after she used stupid remarks to defend this section 8 housing. I have banded together with several others so we can all move out of this dumpTo a safer cleaner place.
