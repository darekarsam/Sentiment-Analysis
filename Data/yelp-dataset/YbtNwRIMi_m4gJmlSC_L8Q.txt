4	Great Ambiance and excellent food make this a "drive out of your way" restaurant. The pizza is top notch; my wife prefers it to Bottegas. I'm giving it 4 stars ' cause the service is sllllowwww. I mean don't make plans for afterword's because you're going to be here for a while. Usually takes us almost 2 hours for dinner. But man the food is good.
4	Excellent!
4	Came here on a Monday night when the place was a bit slow, so service was pretty prompt and attentive. The atmosphere is very nice. We had the potato leek soup, sausage tortellini and mushroom ravioli. Everything was quite good, though a little bit on the salty side. Still, I'd come back again. Prices were reasonable and the food was good.
