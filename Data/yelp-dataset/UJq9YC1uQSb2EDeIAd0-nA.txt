5	This place was the best!
5	Friendly staff/salesman.  Great customer service.  Willing to go the "extra mile" to find just the right vehicle with low mileage AND priced within our budget.  The salesman asked what type of vehicle we were interested in, and did not try to push something else on us just because it happened to be sitting on their lot!  I wish ALL salesmen/dealerships were like the staff at Trucks Only!
5	This place is awesome! My husband and I really needed a truck bad. He does home remodeling and was using all of his tools in our dodge magnum and let's just say it was not working. We weren't getting approved other places and right as we were about to give up we heard an ad on the radio for trucks only so we went up there and we just have to thank Tom and dennis for all of their friendly service and willingness to work with us. We looooooove our truck more than anything and it has been such a life savor! We will recommend everyone we know!! Thanks guys!
