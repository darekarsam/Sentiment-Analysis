4	Had dinner in this beautiful, intimate restaurant.  The service was good (not spectacular, but good.  The food was simply fantastic and the host (the chef) was wonderful.  GREAT restaurant!
5	What a great wee place! The chef/owner Rafael makes you feel incredibly welcome, and the food is really impressive. Their potato, asparagus and dill soup was just lovely. I immediately asked Rafael for the recipe, and have already taken the opportunity to recreate it, at home. The lamb shank main was lovely, too. I even got lured in to trying a very chocolatey dessert, which is rare for me. Hearty, flavour-packed cooking at its best, Rafael's is worth a visit, soon.Overall, we said: "Rafael's was seriously good. Rarely have a spent a more enjoyable evening as a solo diner. The quality of the food on offer was first rate, with excellent ingredients prepared with considerable care and attention."
