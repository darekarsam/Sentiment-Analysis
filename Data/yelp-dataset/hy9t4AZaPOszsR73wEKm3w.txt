2	I don't know why no one has reviewed this place yet.  I personally think the food is not too bad but you can not understand a word of anything anyone working there is trying to say.  I'm sorry.  I am not trying to be rude or disrespectful.  I am being totally honest.  And what really gets me is that what they try to say is no where near what they are trying to say.  The woman had to actually pick up a packet of sugar and show it to the guy behind me so he could understand what she was trying to say.  It's baffling.
5	Okay, all these reviews are shocking to me. This is the busiest restaurant in the mall. Always has a line. I could seriously eat chicken teriyaki with fried rice every day and never get tired of it. The employees are super friendly. They are always saying jokes and having a good time while they prepare the food in front of you. Every time I go to the mall I get lots of waves and smiles from the cooks. LOVE this place.
1	I really like the stuff. Normally, but today they gave me some food that they had already prepared previously. I assumed it hadn't been there for very long. I was wrong when I got to the table into the but it was cold. So I took it back and the guy was indignant about it after he stood there for several minutes he asked me if you wanted him to make a new one. I said no give me my money back because I'm not going to put up with that. Go give somebody else your business there's two other Oriental restaurant pretty much the same thing. I told them I would never buy that stuff again I suggest you do the same thing go to someone that would appreciate your business. That's a negative one star by the way.
