5	This little boutique may be small but it packs a big punch in the world of shoes and I could spend all day drooling over the babies in here. It did make me sad to see my very own peep-toe Louboutins displayed in the window here all shiny and new when mine are a bit more well loved and not in the same condition as the beautiful new ones in the window. Oh well, I guess shoes are for wearing and I've certainly got the wear out of mine.In addition to Louboutins Pam Jenkins also offers, Jimmy Choo's, Tory Burch and Kate Spade so if you're a shoe fan head along here to check out the glamorous heels.They also do sales so you could grab yourself a bargain pair of beautiful shoes. Hurrah!
4	What a cute we shop!! I use the term 'wee' with a big emphasis...!They have the most amazing shoe collection but they also come with the most amazing price tag ever. They sell all the big boys - Louboutin, Jimmy Choo, D&G, you name it they've got it.My mum told me that if I graduate with a 1.1 degree she'll buy me a pair of Louboutins from here - not that's motivation
4	Great little designer show boutique. It's like a candy shop for woman. Didn't have my size in a show and can't order one off pairs from stockist which isn't good but still a fab shop.
