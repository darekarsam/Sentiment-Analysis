1	This taco bell is ALWAYS incredibly slow. Today I sat in the drive through for 20 minutes before I even ordered and there were only 3 cars in front of me. Then I waited another 10 minutes to get my food. If they weren't so slow this would be a great taco bell. it shouldn't take 30 minutes to pick up some fast food.
1	The most horrible Taco Bell I've ever been too. I made my order and waited for her to take my separate order and didn't say anything for 5 mins. I finally drove up and waited for another 5 mins for her to answer the window for me just to repeat my second order in the pouring rain. Then messed up both orders and combined them into 1 full order when I clearly said 2! It takes about 30 minutes to get food here. Even if your the only one in line. Don't eat here. If I could give it 0 stars I would.
1	Let's face it, this is fast food.  This Taco Bill/KFC location is one of the worst I've been to.  I go 4 - 5 times per year since it's close to work.  Usually find the place a little dirty and the service slow - at least it's consistent.  I think they stopped putting any type of sauce in their Bean Burritos and the chicken soft tacos are lacking enough filling - meat, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, etc to even come close to filling the shell.  I've started going to the one near 19th/Deer Valley for a slightly better experience.
