1	I walked into this T-Mobile store by my work during my lunch hour yesterday to add a line to my contract and apparently 4 out of the 5 employees there were also heading out to lunch.  I stood in the space where I thought the line would normally be for at least 5-7 minutes while employees went in and out of the back storage area, logged on and off of computer stations at service desk and answered phones and not one said 'welcome to T-mobile we'll be right with you' or offerd to 'help in just a few minutes'...nothing!I got bored of standing while being ingonerd, so I walked around the store for a bit.  I noticed they have a poorly labeld second desk at the entrance of the store where one of their employees came out of the back room and logged into that station, I gave her a few stares while I was at one of their demo stations to see if she would maybe offer to help and again nothing.  I walked out of there after about 15 minutes of zero acknowledgement or even a sign of service.
5	Chris Perry is the best ever!!! He deserves a raise! He is always helpful to me and my family when it comes to our phone plan!!
5	Blanca made a mess with my account. She added services I did not need and straight up lied to me.Customer service was horrible on her part. However Go with Luis he is absolutely the best. Blanca gave me horrible customers service and added services I didn't need but this guy fixed it all. He is awesome ask for him!
