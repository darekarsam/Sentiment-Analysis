5	I found Arizona Campers on the internet, called and talked with Jim, the owner.  He told me he had two campers that would fit on my 2007 Dodge short-bed pickup.  He gave me the prices on each and also explained what was on each one.  The following morning we talked with Kyle to see if he would hold the campers for us until our arrival the following day.  He agreed to that.  We live in the Central Coast, CA area, so it was a long drive, but we are very happy that we drove the distance for our 825 Lance 2013 camper.  They had the camper looking  like new when we drove away, and we felt as if we not only dealt with an honest, family-owned business but also felt we were friends.  I felt as if the owner was working for me rather than for himself.  The truck/camper drives like a dream.  "Thank you" Arizona Campers.
5	I really like this place.  Jim is EXTREMELY helpful and answered my questions and gave me ideas on fixing my camper shell.  Didn't upsell me or anything. I will be coming back to Arizona Campers & Trailers for all my camper shell needs. Great customer service.
