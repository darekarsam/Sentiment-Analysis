5	The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  They also had a large variety of strains. I will definitely be back.
5	Love this place! It has a professional, respectable feel to it. The shop front is discrete as well as inviting. The interior is clean, bright, and well organized. The staff are friendly and very knowledgeable about the products. I enjoy my visits there and always look forward to going back. Especially to see the new inventory! I definitely recommend this shop!
5	I have been 100% satisfied with the service, compassion, and medicine here. I have been to other centers and now that I have found Harvest I will not be going anywhere else for my meds.
1	Wow. Cool place.friendly people. But when i got home one of my grams clearly had 2 different strains of bud in there which was pretty lame paying 21$ a gram for weed that is equal quality to their cheaper strains. Wax is way over priced also. Everything is extremely expensive. I reccomend looking harder and getting a better deal elsewhere.
5	I think this is my new favorite dispensary. Always friendly, always professional, always well stocked. A little pricier than some others but WELL worth the little extra. Because it is closer to where I live than where I had been going this is my new "go to place". I HIGHLY recommend you give Harvest of Tempe a try.
