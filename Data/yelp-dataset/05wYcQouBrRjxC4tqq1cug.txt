3	Not much remarkable can be said about BBB as a chain. This location always feels a little cramped, but then most of their locations do. It's fine for what it offers, nothing amazing, but nothing bad either. Lots of homegoods of the mid- to up-market variety and gobs of kitchen gadgets.
3	It's BB&B.  It's a bit pricey, but they do have a lot of stuff you just can't find anywhere else around Madison.  And, if you get on their mailing list, they send you 20% off coupons in the mail.  That helps quite a bit!
3	I don't know what it is about large box stores having inconsistent layouts, but it throws me off. I've been to BB&Bs on the west side, in Arkansas, San Francisco, and Washington DC - all have had a "counter-clockwise" traffic flow. This store flows clockwise and it throws me off a little. Probably says more about me than anything else, but oh well. :-)+ Good selection of kitchen wares+ Lots of "as seen on TV" stuff (if you're into that)- Pricier than most competitors+ If you have one of those infamous 20% off coupons, prices calm down a bit+ Staff here is helpful and friendly- Not as spacious as other locations; gets crowded quite easily+ Usually have plenty of check-out lanes open and activeGenerally speaking, I typically only shop at BB&B when I'm in dire need for something *immediately*. Otherwise, I'll order it online, or shop elsewhere, as prices are typically better, and I don't have to remember to bring along one of those coupons.+ Love that the coupons never expired; I used one today from 2008.
