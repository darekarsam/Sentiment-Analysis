1	Abysmally piss-poor management. The security and maintenance guys seem nice, but the last manager was hard-pressed to get around to doing things (we had to move the stove into our unit ourselves, the place was never cleaned, we had to install our own blinds and repair a running toilet, etc.) and the new one is worse.Right after she took over, she went around to a lot of the tenants, ourselves included, stating that they were owed money on our accounts from late fees that we couldn't figure out why they were assessed, or other reasons. She's seemingly never in the office, and sometimes will return a call at nine PM, long after office hours have concluded, when I called in at ten AM. Other times she simply never returns a call.I found out later that she had some health issues and worked from her home unit sometimes, which is understandable (as it's also the location of the after-hours drop box). But that was *never* posted at the office, only at her unit, where that information would be seen by few.The units have a nice layout and when we moved in, were good for the price, but as I mentioned earlier, we had to clean the unit upon moving in and fix things ourselves. They gave us the parts we needed--toilet stopper and hanging blinds--but we had to do it, lest it *never* get done. They never gave us the doors for the washer and dryer cubby ("Oh, you want those? Most people don't like them."), never repaired the dog damage to the walls, carpet and one of the doors from the previous tenants, never got around to reinstalling the smoke detectors, never bothered to get some paint off the hardwood floors, and the list goes on.Thanks for nothing, Tango Bay.
1	So I was going to move in next week and here are the reasons why it is not happening!  Deplorable conditions after esther stated that it was ready. Not for 750 a month
