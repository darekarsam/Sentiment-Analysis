4	B1 can best be described as quirky and eccentric yet completely awesome.  It is the only bar I have ever seen that has a barber shop in it.  Just for fun we asked our waiter how much a haircut costs and it was $30 including a cocktail.  It certainly would make for a unique experience!  The bar also has what I believe was an N64 so you can game and drink.  We even saw people playing Jenga.If you're into cocktails then you're in the right place if you come here.  Prices are on par with other bars in Montreal at around $10 a drink.  My Brooklyn Sour was a little too sweet for me but the drinks' presentation was excellent.  You can get drinks in tiki glasses and complete with fancy garnishes and everything.There isn't much in terms of food except some grilled cheese so if you're hungry make plans to eat elsewhere.  That being said totally check this place out when you get the chance.  It will make for a fun experience.
