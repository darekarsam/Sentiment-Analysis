4	We love this sushi place! I don't think we could ever do all-you-can-eat sushi again because we order the a la carte from Okane (they only have a la carte) and we end up getting everything we would order and it ends up being cheaper than what we pay at all-you-can-eat places, and the quality is night and day. I'm sure there are many other great a la carte sushi places in Montreal but this is the best one we've found in the griffintown area so far. It's fresh and well made, and the people who work there are very sweet.
3	Good for an average sushi place, very fast service for takeout. Don't expect any creative sushis. The menu is very basic and standard. I would say to stay with the safe choices such as salmon and tuna. I don't know if they sell enough of the other stuff to guarantee freshness. From the display from the sushi bar, I don't believe they do. By no means go out of your way for this place. I recommend it only for people who live or study nearby to satisfy a craving.
3	I've been ordering sushis for almost 2 years at Okane and I really appreciate the friendly service. The sushis themselves are pretty standard and do a good job for your weekday cravings. Don't expect anything out of this world in terms of creativity or flavours. Not overly expensive, I will keep ordering since its conveniently located and there is no other sushi place nearby.
