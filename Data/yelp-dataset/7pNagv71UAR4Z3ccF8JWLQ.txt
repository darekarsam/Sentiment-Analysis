3	BK isn't on the top of my list for fast food... but once in a while I want a bacon, egg, and cheese croissanwich. This place is okay, even though one time I got an icee that was kind of yucky so I had to throw it away - I don't even want to know what happened to it. I'll still come back for my croissanwich though.
2	But they are improving and the rodeo burger is back. Even with that though it is still the worst fast food around.
4	I tried going a taco hell drive thru again ... another one under construction!   What is up with that?!?  So she went to BK... and pretended like I never order fast food, had to drive up to explain just how I wanted my chicken sand... apologized profusely for not knowing the menu.  LOLThey were very nice although they charged me for a soda even though all I asked for was ice.  I have got to stop this fast food track I'm on or I won't fit in my cute new car!Sometimes it's just so damn convenient and when you are always in a hurry like me, this BK drive thru meets your needs quick!
