2	You would think the employees would be nice being a small town post office.  I have been coming here for years and the employees are grumpy and miserable.  Especially Harold.  Would it kill them to say hello, goodbye and thank you?  It's the same every time I come here.  Today I came in to buy stamps to mail Christmas cards and he gave me West Virginia stamps.  When I asked to have them exchanged for holiday stamps they obliged but of course as always, no "goodbye" or "have a nice day."  I said "goodbye" and got nothing.  Basic etiquette people.
1	This has to be the worst company in the world..how are they still in business..customer services like Dealing with a zoo.. Nobody takes responsibility for anything.. Please therefore  do not ship any package USPO.. And why as a public are we worrying about them privatising the mail.. Remember public word-of-mouth is everything I was I would have known about the services before hand .. Now I know & will be speeding  the world to everyone I know. To avoid using the post office by all means.. Pay your bills online they offer fee money orders @ some money cash place. I hope this help someone before it's two late for them
