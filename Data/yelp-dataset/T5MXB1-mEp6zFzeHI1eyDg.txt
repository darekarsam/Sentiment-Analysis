4	Glenha's serve up some good old fashioned grub on the Royal Mile. Bacon rolls, fry ups for breakfast and (a more unusual option) hot dogs are on the menu.It's nicely decorated, the service is efficient and it's always thronging which proves how popular it is. It looks quite swish from the outside but the prices aren't through the roof, which makes it exceptionally affordable on the Royal Mile. With filled rolls, baguettes and sweets, I've got to say my favourite snack from Glenha's has got to be one of their breakfast rolls. Fry up's are good old fashioned, simple food, and they always hit the spot. Especially if you're knackered after making it up hilly Cockburn Street to get here!Great prices, loads of outdoor seating and speedy service, it's one of the best snack bars on the Royal Mile. And I still can't believe how affordable it is!
4	Glenha's is your typical British cafe! Well, it's a bit more exciting decor-wise, but it serves everything you would expect to get in one. Fry-ups, Bacon Rolls, Sausage rolls, tea, coffee, you name it. For that Glenha's, I am eternally greatful!!I walk up here every other day to get to wherever I'm going, and the smell almost always tempts me in. It's easy, it's reliable and it's quick.
