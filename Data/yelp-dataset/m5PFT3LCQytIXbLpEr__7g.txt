5	The best Doctor Office EVER!!!  Great office staff, nurse practitioner and pediatric doctor.  My daughter loves their office and so do I.  I would recommend the office to anyone with a child!
5	We love Dr. Pendleton! I switched to her office when my daughter was younger and we were unhappy with Healing Hearts Peds. We have been a patient for over 5 years now. Always easy to get an appointment when needed and Danielle & Dr Pendleton are wonderful with my kids.
5	We have been seeing Dr Pendleton since our son was born last year. The first few visits, like when we got our son circumcised, we saw Dr Judy. She is obviously extremely experienced. But since then we've seen Danielle. We LOVE Danielle. Our son is very shy and fearful of new people and he loves her too. She is so gentle and good at examining him without making him nervous or uncomfortable. When our son had a breathing problem, they referred us to specialists close by and even helped us get an appointment. They were great about following up. Originally, we weren't very comfortable with all of the immunizations, and they were wonderful enough to sit down and explain what each one was, what the risks were, and why it's important. I don't think our son has ever had more than three at a time, and when he was little they spread them out more for us. They have an alternative plan you can sign up for. Since then, we've transferred to the normal schedule.When we first brought our son, I was a new mother and fairly sensitive. Something an receptionist said upset me. I shared this with Dr Judy, and she handled it great. I felt so much better after talking with her. And now we know all the office staff by name and they recognize us too. Our son has gotten sick and done three or four sick visits with them in the last year. I feel like they don't overmedicate, and really talk it through with you.
