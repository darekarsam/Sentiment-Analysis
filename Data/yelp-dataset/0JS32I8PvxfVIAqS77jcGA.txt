5	So happy Chipotle is now in the mall. Now my lunches are much more amazing! The menu is simple and no matter what you get, it's delicious! The employees have been friendly the few times I've been there which is great because not a lot of places have that anymore.
4	Great staff, fast service, 1 of the best places to eat in the mall.
3	I am grateful that there is one the mall now since I don't like any of the other choices there besides maybe Paradise Bakery. But I know they are still quite new and the few times I've been there they are a bit slower and prepping the food and have a smaller staff. Sometimes the portions I got were very small and had to keep repeating for larger scoops. But overall they its good.
