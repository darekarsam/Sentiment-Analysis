4	They dropped some menus at our building recently. I noticed that they deliver, which is great when you are stuck at home with a toddler and no car. Everything we got, including lo mein, general tso's, egg rolls, and fried wonton, tasted great. I wasn't expecting much more than convenience but I was pleasantly surprised. The delivery guy and the girl on the phone were friendly, and the food came quickly.  If you want some guilty pleasure food, this is a good place for it.
5	love their fried rice. crave their chicken and broccoli. steamed dumplings are awesome. only problem is that I'm less than a half mile away and it takes 45 minutes for delivery. I order when I'm not hungry so I will be when it gets here. yum!
3	This restaurant has changed management and has a new name. Delivery minimum went up and now there is a fee for delivery. Much of the food has changed recipes. Most everything I've ordered has still been fine, some things better, other things not. Portions definitely seem smaller.
