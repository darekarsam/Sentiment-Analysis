3	Prompt but the soda is always off tasting. The parking lot smells like sewer gas which can be a definite turn off. Employees are nice.
1	This one sucks because its a franchise and everything is more expensive.:)
5	It's TACO BELL!  You get exactly what you order every time, and the quality is always good!
4	Drive thru was pretty good. They didn't know what I wanted when I said the quesadilla wrapped burrito. They only knew it by Quesarito.  It was good. Quite filling. It was $3.79 which is pricier than regular burritos and tacos, but it was a delicious combination.
3	Clean and well organized. Slightly above average chain location.
3	I was visiting Home Depot and went to Taco Bell as they are next to each other.  I waled to the counter to order and saw 5-6 employees taking care of drive through customers.  There was a Taco Bell management meeting in the lobby with 5-6 other people having a planning meeting.  Unfortunately, there was no one to take my order.  I would give the rating a 1-star except for an employee from the back contacted the person who was supposed to be working the counter.  The person that came to take my order was obviously a trainee and did not know how to enter my order.  That explains why he was hiding in the back.It was not a good experience.  I live near this Taco Bell location and will not be back anytime soon.  It was really a case of poor store management to leave a shy trainee in charge of taking customer orders.
