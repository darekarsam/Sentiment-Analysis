5	Great small family owned salon.  Friendly, personal and affordable!
5	They took the time to find a color that wouldn't fade off my hair because I have fine, thin, blonde hair. The hair products are really nice on my hair - they were soft and sensitive. I love the time and attention to details. Can't wait to go back!
5	I love this shop.  I have been having my haircut by Lisa Erica for the past several years.  She does a great job at reasonable price.  She makes great suggestions for a haircut, but is also willing to cut your hair exactly as you request it.
