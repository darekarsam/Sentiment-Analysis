4	After searching for Rockaberry in DDO and seeing it had a 2-star rating, I knew something needed to be done. I can't speak for the service as I rarely eat in the restaurant, and thankfully, I don't have experience sitting near the washroom as Scott did, but if there's one thing I know for sure about Rockaberry (any of them, really), it's that when I want pie, it's the place to go to. There are so many amazing flavours. In the mood for something rich? Try Caramel Fudge Cheese or it's Raspberry Fudge Cheese cousin. Want something fruity and refreshing? Strawberry Peach Crumble is amazing, as is the rhubarb, and the classic apple. Awesome. They're ALL really great.Okay. Stop reading this. Just grab a friend and go, or go alone, like I do, grab a whole pie, and bring it back to a big group of friends. Now.
5	I think Rockaberry's deserves another review since it's been newly renovated. (I apologize for not snapping pics).The pies are as delicious as they've always been. This is a great quiet place to take a  new date for a drink and pie unless you're from the DDO/Pointe Claire, in which case you're almost guaranteed to see a familiar face.Since the renovation Rockaberry's also amped up their menu. I like that they list a bunch of sandwiches and offer them as wrap, sandwich or pannini. It adds a lot of variety to suit my mood without over-complicating the menu and overwhelming the cooks, which I hate. The meals are delicious and well portioned. Rockaberry's is still a cafe-type location so expect your sandwich & salad to cost slightly more than neghbouring fast food joints (avg $14). I do, however, see justification in the prices.Had I written this review 2 years ago, I would be giving the place 2-3 stars but the reinvigorated menu, modernized decor and improved lighting make it so that I have nothing to nitpick.Rockaberry's also offers takeout on whole pies w/o tax ($15-$24). Grabbing one just before you get on the highway will make you a hit at any pot luck.
