2	Ok, me and my friend went there on a random Sunday night. Line up was huge but we did what we always do - went up straight to the bouncer, he said that ladies drink free tonight but the cover is $20. Then i don't know what happened, but we sort of just walked in and pass the cash person... and noone stopped us! lol.. so much for the $20!!! But even free liquor did not save that place! Everyone looked underage there - very sad crowd! Music was bad too! I was hoping for some nice house but they played some top 40 garbage that was from like 5 years ago! We did take advantage of free liquor though! :)
5	So its Sunday night and in the middle of a little three day get away in this beautiful cold city in the beautiful cool country of Canada.   I decide to check this place out by myself, leaving my wife and daughter in the hotel room to sleep early.  Its been around seven years or so since I came to this club, back then it was called the Dome, and it was an ok spot.Well they have turned it into quite a sleek and very Euro and chic club.  I get there and there is a substantial line.  Its only around 10:30 or so and inside there is quite a bit of a crowd already.   The music is House and Techno and the DJ was as good as I have heard anywhere.  I ordered a Red Bull and relax in a corner.   After about a few minutes I start to jam and again noticed that most of the people did'nt really know how to dance to this kind of music, but did'nt care much, just happy to finally have a good forty minutes of grooving to the best dance music out there.  At about 11:45 to midnight the place started getting very crowded and I left a little past 12:30.    Overall one of the cooler clubs I have personally been in, and definitely will be back next trip out here.  The place is pretty much the Montreal version of Boston's Roxy or The Estate, and pretty much the same cover charge and drink prices...
