4	The most appreciated part of this store is that they do a really good job packaging items for shipment.  I have not really used this location for many things other than shipping, but everything has gone out accurately as promised and like I said the packaging is flawless.  Good for those occasional ebay sales.
5	Staff is friendly and helpful.
2	None of the 3 copy machines they have in the lobby work. If you want copies you have to wait in line for someone behind the counter to make them for you and that can take forever!!!! How bout you FIX at least ONE of the three copy machines you have just sitting there?!?!?!
1	This UPS should not even get 1 star... They do not know the meaning of what customer service is... I'm still waiting to hear back from somebody with "authority" to call me back; it has now been a week...
