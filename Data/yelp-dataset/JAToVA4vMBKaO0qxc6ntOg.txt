5	Recently I made the decision to stop smoking. It was more difficult this time than I thought it would be. I bought a couple of e-cigs. The draw was terrible and the vapor was inconsistent. I stopped by Vapes plus. I wanted to support a local business. I could not have made a better choice. Sonny was a great help in educating me about vaping. He asked me to bring in the pack of smokes I had. After crushing the pack and tossing it, he had a surprise for me. If you are serious about quitting the cigarette habit, stop by, see Sonny, bring in your (last) pack and let him surprise you. He has my business.
5	Great location, hours, and very helpful and knowledgeable staff. You can even go buy vape supplies on a Sunday evening in Charlotte. Nice!
