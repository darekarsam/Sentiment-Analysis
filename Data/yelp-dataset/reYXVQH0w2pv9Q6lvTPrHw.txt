5	I'm a trinni girl myself, and can cook what I think is some mean west Indian food, so I tend to get extra critical when I eat west Indian food made by other people.When this place first opened years ago, I decided to give them a chance.  I can say with 100% honesty that it has been my go to place for Caribbean take out when I don't feel like cooking.   Their jerk chicken is amazing, their curry chicken is amazing, their doubles are HUGE, and they offer a nice selection of chick peas, chicken, shrimp and goat doubles, and they are DIRT CHEAP.  The food is seasoned perfectly.  It's family owned and the family are such nice people.This is DEFINITELY a place to check out if you are in Montreal and want some good quality west Indian food.  The ambiance is rather bland, although they do have an out of place pool table in the back, but it's the food you're going for, and for the years I've been going there, it's always been consistent, and always been great.
4	This place is one of those hidden jewels that everybody keeps a secret and orders from then claims they cooked it themselves. Its known that Caribbean folks are passionate about cooking  and have no problem when it comes to spicing their foods and its safe to say that the flavor boat has dropped anchor in this little gem   . this is a great place to go to try something new and different ... Note the hot sauce is house made and is Hot not hot like wow that's spicy but more like OMG My Mouth is on fire call 911 Hot. you 'll have to try their doubles witch is the Caribbean version of the burger . your pallet will thank you after dining here !
5	Best jerk chicken in town. A real nice Trini restaurant. I am yet to try other dishes as I always fall for the jerk.
