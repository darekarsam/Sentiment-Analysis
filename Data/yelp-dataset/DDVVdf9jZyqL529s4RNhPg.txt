5	Woo first to review!A place like this definitely deserves a review on here. I went in today on my way to get "mah herr did", as recommended by the lady who was doing my hair. Tucked into a little shopping plaza, Vanessa welcomed me immediately and helped me find exactly what I needed. She even showed me some other products that would help me out with the style I was getting done, but wasn't pushy at all. This is an up and coming business that I wish tons of luck.
5	Nice store, good selection and awesome staff. Syerita was so helpful and kind. Thanks for all the help today. I am pretty sure they treat everyone like this! we will be back!
5	This place is amazing! The owners are friendly, welcoming and extremely knowledgable about products, extensions, and just hair in general. Thankfully because I know nothing, and I am not from around here. I highly reccomend this place for anyone and everyone. I'll be back frequently for sure ;-)
