5	Little Shanghai has the best Chinese food that I've been able to find in the city. The steamed flounder with bean curd is great. It comes in 2 fillets for $13.95. I loved the texture of the crispy tofu in the spinach with garlic and tofu dish. The broth of the noodle soup with spare ribs has a wonderful flavor and the dish is more than enough to fill up one person.I wish the restaurant had better loose leaf tea (they use a tea bag) but the food is excellent. I would highly recommend this restaurant.
4	One of the best Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh. It's a little small and the restaurant itself may look dingy but don't be fooled. The food here is delicious. Definitely go with someone who can read/speak Chinese to order the more authentic dishes.Some things to order:Salt and Pepper Pork ChopsSteamed Fish (Dou Su Yu)Flounder (Xue Cai Long Li Pian)
2	Not the worst, but definitely not the best. It's probably my own fault bc I don't speak or read Chinese and I was forced to order Americanized dishes. Couldn't swear to it that my chicken in the chicken and broccoli was chicken. Just saying.
4	Little Shanghai has pretty good chinese food. I had some sort of shrimp and chicken dish (I forget the name), and found it made for a decent Sunday night dinner. The restaurant itself is small and the staff is a little icy. All in all though, it's worth checking out.
