5	I needed eye specialist for my daughter on a Saturday.   I didn't want to go to urgent care ir emergency room as they are not specialist in diagnosing eye problems. This office was accommodating. Everyone was pleasant and proffesional. This doctor took time to diagnose but ended up referring us to specialist for further evaluation. She is carring doctor with excellent bed side manners.  We came back for an eye exam and glasses. It took only half an hour to have glasses done!
5	Dr. Meharry is the absolute best. It's difficult to find precision, accuracy -and- someone who puts you at ease immediately with a great laugh and rapport. Dr. Meharry has nailed all-of-the-above, and she makes a the normally mundane and painfully routine process of eye exams enjoyable. I'm always impressed by Dr. Meharry's ability to offer solutions personalized to each of her patients. I have a stronger astigmatism, making it harder to fit me for contacts, but she always has a great solution that's comfortable, smart and affordable. She is extremely patient and always makes time for my questions about eye wear and care, (and there are many).Dr. Meharry is an all-around pro and an expert in her field. You won't be disappointed!!
