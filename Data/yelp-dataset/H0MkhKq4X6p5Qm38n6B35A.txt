4	Came here with a few non-Yelping friends who are regulars, after seeing the low ratings I initially hesitated spending my money here. However, I was pleasantly surprised. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with smiles and assistance. We ordered a few plates so I could get a good taste of what was going on here, from an appetizer of dumplings, to spicy pork with rice and bulgogi beef with rice. Seemed to me like the owners were also the only two running this small restaurant, the wife taking the orders and the husband whipping up this Korean-goodness. I definitely enjoyed it and found it to be inexpensive for the (good) quality and portions.  Check it out!
5	Such a friendly little restaurant!! The food is just so good! It was my first time trying Korean food. I had fried dumplings - they were heavenly delicious! and then some excellent sushis, extremely fresh with lots of caviar sprinkled on them. I returned to try something more Korean, the bibimbap, and it was as delicious as it looked. I'm very satisfied with the portions, the service and the pricing. The owners are angels!!
