5	We absolutely love Dr. Taylor and his staff. I have a 2 year old that was pretty scared when she came in, but after his dental assistant showed her how the x-rays and camera worked, she got her to open up wide with no problems. They are extremely friendly and thorough. They have so many cool things to make kids comfortable. By the end of the visit she didn't want to leave!
5	Going to the dentist for the first time can be scary for a three year old.  The office atmosphere was soothing and engaging.  The staff showed my son every step of the process from the tools, what they will do and keeping him interested.  This kept his fears and anxiety down.  My wife noticed every child in the office was having the same great experience.  As a parent you want to make the best decisions for your children and we are confident we did by choosing Kids Grins Pediatric Dentistry.
1	I took my kids there when they were younger -on one check up I was told my son had a cavity. I scheduled an appointment for the following week to get it filled. Just happened that the next day I had an appointment at my dentist and I had them look at my son's tooth. They couldn't find anything! They even called to have the x-rays transferred and there was no sign of a cavity. Will never do business again.
5	Dr Taylor and his staff are the Best!  My little guy is always super anxious about going to the dentist.  Kids Grins makes the whole process much easier!Once you enter they have a little area on the side where you can play on I-pads.  My little guy goes right over there and forgets he is at the dentist until his name is called.  Once they call his name the assistants  always talk directly to my little boy and use words an positive body language to help him feel like its going to be OK.  Dr Taylor has a demeanor about him that shows compassion and care for his patients and especially my little guy.Thank you for your attention to detail.  Happy to be a customer!
