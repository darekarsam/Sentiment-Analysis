4	Sala has some serious talent! I have natural hair and am very picky about my stylists. I found Sala to be gentle with my hair. She does not blow dry rough, like a lot of other stylists I have been to. She also does a great shampoo. I have had her trim my hair as well and felt she was thorough without cutting too much. The only reason she doesn't get 5 stars is b/c I didn't get that "warm & fuzzy" feeling at her salon. She does great hair but doesn't really give a relaxing experience like I have found at other salons offering water or wine, and just an overall relaxing environment.
5	Last week I bought a LivingSocial coupon for a keratin treatment at Salon Salas and  went today for my appointment. I must admit, I was initially a bit nervous about doing the keratin treatment,  but Sala uses product that is supposed to be formaldehyde and aldehyde free. I arrived a bit early for my appointment and had a short wait.  When it was time for my appointment, I was taken back for a shampoo.  Sala applied the treatment to my hair and  waited for a little while for the product to set.  Sala was efficient, friendly, and very professional.  She did a great job with my hair and made me feel very comfortable at her salon.  The jury is still out on whether I will do another keratin treatment in the future.  But, as far as the salon, I had a great experience and would definitely go back for more services here!
