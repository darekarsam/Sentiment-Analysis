5	You will loose your mind over the good quality overstock magnificent vintage items! She's buys and sells
5	This is a great place!  I found some vintage Metal Cigarette cases (business card size).  She knows her antiques and she knows her inventory well!  She has a lot of merchandise here.  She is very friendly and helpful too!
4	This place is small, but packed to the top with a lot of great finds. I wish I'd had more time to play in there. The more I looked the more I found that I loved. TONS & tons of vintage & antique costume jewelry with rhinestones & thousands of necklaces, brooches, earrings, bracelets... Victorian, Deco, 50's, crystal, gilt, glass... So many beautiful pieces. The prices on almost everything I wanted was a little higher that I would pay because I repurpose stuff - but she did say she'd give 30% off many things over $20, or maybe that was under $20 if cash or check was used. She has it all organized, however so many boxes are stacked on top of the other, so if you don't see it - ask Christy, she'll go right to what your looking for!! I'm hoping to go back sometime soon, but I live in Raleigh & was visiting Charlotte this weekend - she really had SO MANY great pieces - oh, make sure you look in the back & open drawers - lots of hidden treasures!
5	Bravo! A terrific Antique Store. The lady knows her stuff too. I looked around a while but didn't buy anything. But, this is a great Antiques store.
