5	Talk about great Dive bar in the middle of nowhere or should say only thing that out here surrounded by bunch of homes. Dive bar for sure because its literally next too gas station convenient store and no kitchen no food. It was Iceacholis get together since had teammate visiting from the islands.  Friday night so happen too be karaoke night. I never been much fan of karaoke night but must admit good times. The girl that was running it even brought over some food since they have no kitchen. It probably varies what she brings but hell lets me honest nice gesture and keeps all the karaoke American Idol dreamer happy and in the building. Talk about few. It was ok then once the singing started place filled up pretty good. It free entertainment!!! If want too sing just tip dollar per song although not required. Right thing too do. They have ample television around the bar area too watch games or whatever on, More then ample machines around the bar too get your gambling on. The reason why its as good as it gets is the service. Honest a Dive bar if not for the nostalgic unique things which Foothills Tavern its has its own personality. Heather the bartender. HEATHER HEATHER. Coolest bartender, very attentive never empty glass when she working, friendly, and part of iceacholis family always support my girl wherever she goes. Brings positive vibes, biggest smile, and makes awesome mixed shots! I had few that night! Wish the bar little closer too where I live, -((((
5	I love this little bar. It's right around the corner from my house and I've gotten to know all the bartenders. They are all great, talkative, and friendly. The machines aren't that friendly but the drinks are decently priced. It's hit or miss with the blackjack.
5	Great little dive in bar. Bartenders and people are very chill. Drinks are fairly priced.
