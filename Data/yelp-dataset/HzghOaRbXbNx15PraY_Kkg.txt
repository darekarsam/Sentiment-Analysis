4	A Pleasant PlaceDecent sandwiches. Chips, bottled drinks, candy bars, soup etc.Big glass windows in front with tables next to it. Picturesque view
5	The food is great here.  Lots of unique salad choices and great sandwiches.  Prices are reasonable.  The only problem I have with this place is it only opens for like 9-5 or 6 and closed on sundays and maybe saturdays.  Otherwise great food, salad, drink selection at a hell of a price.
