5	We love Alicia!  We have a spaz of a dog that has been a nightmare for every other groomer.  Alicia does a great job despite how crazy he is and comes to your door, what more could you ask for.
5	Great groomer and love that she comes to my house. I had three puppies and it was so had to take them all in the car when they had to be groomed. Sure makes things easier. Oh yeah and she is a really sweet person who loves the pets.
5	Alicia is great! Our two giant, crazy Rottweilers were in need of a wash, nail trim and shave. She did an amazing job! Our dogs came out one by one looking beautifully shaved and smelling great. She was very knowledgable about medications that the dogs were taking and what they were in need of. Alicia was friendly and was very sweet to the dogs, they liked her a lot! We will definitely be using her service again.
5	Love them the groomer tiffany came and did my mother's dogs today! They look amazing she's definitely a sweet heart and took her time with them all! She really made my mom's day! Thanks guys
5	LOVED them! on time, considerate, competitive price, good work, and the groomer was great about all my anxiety! My pup looked great and I smelled good too.
1	Went to her new dog wash on eastern ..  They are 20 for self wash which is ridiculous in itself. They dont keep it clean and they dont have the best shampoos.  I believe i spoke to the owner because she was very rude and defensive.  They dont have proper holsters for multiple dogs. .. i had to ask for a waterproof cape after i was soaked. After being washed my dogs still don't smell clean after their shampoo. Overall worst experience.
5	I love this place! They did an excellent job grooming my cat and everybody there is extremely nice!  I would highly recommend this place to anybody in need of cat grooming!
