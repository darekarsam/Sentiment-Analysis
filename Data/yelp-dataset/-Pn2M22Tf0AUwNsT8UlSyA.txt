1	Spent $9000, then spent an additional $12000 for landscaping and a gas firepit accent in my back yard.  less than two years later the accent doesn't even work, and have used it MAYBE 20 times... and they want to charge $250 for a "courtesy call" which is scheduled 6 weeks from now? What a joke!
1	this has been a nightmare company to work with. we got an original bid and then decided to down size our project to stay within our budget. we eliminated some of the things we wanted figuring it would lower the total cost only to find out that Damon had raised the cost of labor, removal and cost per item to keep the bill high. what a con artist. when i approached him on the subject he avoided me for weeks until he wanted his final payment. we had to pay for lighting in the back yard that Damon ordered then didnt install or deliver. im owed over $2000 in lighting that i cant get a return call on. damon is a joke. he has no landscaping skills what soever. he over charges on everything. BIG RIPOFF!!!!!!
5	I had Green Planet design and construct my backyard which included outdoor kitchen, fire pit, rocked pool sitting wall, Zen Garden, retaining walls, and landscaping.  This install was done 8 years ago and everything is in perfect working order today - also the landscaping has grown in perfectly.  We have a beautiful outdoor living space that provides so much enjoyment for our family and friends.
