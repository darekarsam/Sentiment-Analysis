4	Very trendy, lounge and HOT ASS HOSTESSES!!!!If you like night life and you want to pre-game before going out, this is the place to be.Great atmosphere. Food is very good too. Best part of this restaurant, people. Plenty of beautiful people to look at while eating. Eye candies left and right. Mmm~~ Merci Bercoup!!!
3	Fun place to chill out with a couple of friends.The sandwiches are good. The desserts are overpriced but yummy, but what do you expect, it's a lounge. Great music for a night out and yes for you guys out there, there is lots of eye candy like the other review stated:)
4	A very high end bar for Laval. Very hot women and girls. Way too overpriced for what you get. A bit snobby but overall nice ambiance.
