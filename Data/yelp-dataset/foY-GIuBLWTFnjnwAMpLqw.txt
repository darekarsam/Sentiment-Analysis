5	Customer service is great here. Very friendly! They have a great selection of raspados, fresh fruit bionicos, ice cream etc. It's hard to find these kind of places on the west side and I just happened to stumble across this place a few days ago. Definitely worth try. Check it out!
5	The best raspados and diablitos!!! Fresas con crema, milkshakes and much more. Everything is delicious plus saturdays and sundays they have the best hot dogs!
5	I think I'm the only white person who knows about this place.Everything seems to be written in Spanish.I don't understand the menu or what people are eating and saying, but the drinks they make are awesome.I guess they are called "raspados?"  I still don't know what that means.Anyway, I highly recommend you stop by for a visit.I have been here multiple times.  The quality of their products and excellent customer service is always consistent.
5	...and now they make bacon-wrapped hot dogs!?I'll take 10, please and thank you!I guess I was a little late to the hot dog party, so to speak.I wish I had known sooner.Zaipi's is now my go-to place for cheap, kick-ass hot dogs.In my opinion, these guys make a much better hot dog than Short Leash in Phoenix.You can go here and pay $2.50 for a superior product or you can go to Short Leash Hot Dogs and pay $10.00 for a mediocre product.It's not a difficult decision.
