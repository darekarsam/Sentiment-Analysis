4	Pretty good...for mc donald's.
4	Excellent drive thru dude! I would have given them a perfect score, but the chick he was working with wanted charge extra sauce, when he was just trying to hook it up! Thanks for trying man:)
1	The dude at the drive-thru never fails to mess up my order...granted it's a coffee drink which can be complicated. However, it's the only thing I ever purchase and I'm saddened each and every time I opt to go there out of convenience. Can't beat the price though.
4	Well, this time they forgot a couple burgers, but this is a first at this McDonalds.  At leadt they were friendly and even reognized me 15 minutes later.  Issue quickly corrected witg a smile.
