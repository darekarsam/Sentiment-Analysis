4	The cauliflower soup and pulled pork sandwich were yummy. Very friendly staff too!
4	Only place in the downtown core you can find a vegetable meal that doesn't also require a commitment to vegan or raw foods. The lunch hour opening hours and fast depleting daily menu will require planning and an open mind on your part. Never come here with a insatiable craving for something specific.The variety of soups is fun to return to throughout the week. The only soft spot is the almost non existent spice. Which isn't to say they lack flavour, but rather any sort of kick or daring you might expect from a place so dedicated to the broth arts. Super affordable unless you also want a sandwich, in which case be prepared for a $20 lunch. Also the pudding chomeur is worth a trip by itself. FYI. Please show up before 12 or after 1.
