4	NOW OPEN. Same location as Thai Express -- in a shared cafeteria. Place is very clean. Food is fresh and delicious. Had the tuna tartare. Very tasty and well priced.This location is new, but not easy to find. It's just off Decarie (Autoroute 15 S) adjacent to the Walmart parking lot. It is a small place, cafeteria style, in the same building as Thai Express. Very good choice for a budget-conscious traveler, for lunch or dinner.Please note, this place closes early (weeknights at 8 PM).
4	My sister is keen on this place so we gave it a shot tonight, and ended up getting way too much stuff - well, ok we managed to eat it all but I was stuffed by the end. We got: salmon tartare maki, tuna tartare maki, 9-1-1 roll, sweetheart roll, exotik roll, calypso roll, and the sirocco hako (sort of like pressed sushi). For the price, everything was pretty spot on, the only thing I found was that the smoked salmon they used was a little too smokey, it permeated the sweetheart roll even though it was mixed with raw salmon.They have things already made if you need to stop in and grab something quickly, and they're much better for you than fast food - so what more can you ask for? No it's not the hippest joint with swank decor, but if you want sushi and you want it now, then this is a great choice.
1	Sloppy staff. This is the second time I've got to this resto and I've ordered sushi and half the ingredients are missing. For example I ordered a syake tempura, it comes with saumon and green onion. All that I've received was just saumon. I don't know if they don't care or just aren't trained. I've been to the one downtown and it's never happened. Clients expect a certain taste to their sushi, and if an ingredient is missing it completely throws it off. I won't be going here again.
