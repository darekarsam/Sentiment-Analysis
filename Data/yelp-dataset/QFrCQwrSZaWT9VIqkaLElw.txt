5	This company works really fast, they're friendly and they fixed my Internet problem with my desktop really quickly. I definitely recommend them.
5	My laptop crashed. I looked up computer repair in the area. Called a few places and not only was Drew at Reboot Tech the fairest price but also he had it back to me a couple of hours later fixed but with additional security updates at no additional charge. Drew has also been available with questions I've had since by phone. I highly recommend Reboot to anyone in the area.
5	I had a virus on my computer that made it so I couldnt even start it up.  I called Drew and he happened to be close to my neighborhood so he came and picked up my computer.  I was able to pick it up the next day.  He charged me $56, which I thought was a very good deal.  My computer is running fine now and he even installed an anti virus program for free and also repaired my power cable for free too.  I would definitely recommend Reboot to my friends and family.
5	Drew was awesome!  My computer had been freezing and was acting weird so I searched around for a computer wiz to clean it up. Too many people told me not to use the geek squad,  so I figured I would search around for a local person. Reboot had good reviews,  so I went with them. Drew was great, I dropped my computer off to him and he had it up and running the next day, and the price couldn't be beat! Might I mention that he fixed my computer so efficiently while dealing with the aftermath of a flooded shop and home?  He truly takes his business seriously.  My computer is running like new. He even followed up with a phone call to see how my computer was running.  That's service! Highly recommended.
