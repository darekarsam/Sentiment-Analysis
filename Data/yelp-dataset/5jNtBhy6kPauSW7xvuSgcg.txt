5	Great food.  Great people.  Great atmosphere. Love it! They are brand new, so they had a few glitches, but all in all its a great place to eat!
5	What a wonderful and refreshing change, from a fast food pizza and wing joint.  The food was great, service was superb. The quality and taste brought back memories of Little Italy in NYS.  If I had read the reviews before I went there I would not have gone.  what a big, big mistake.  I did notice that the negative reviews was for the pizza.  I asked many of my neighbors regarding the pizza, and they stated it was great, so I do not know what the other reviewers where tasting.All in all, keep up the good work, great remodel job, excellent food, service and atmosphere.
5	What a great dining experience my daughter & I had at Valentino's Eatery! We were on vacation in AZ & came upon this small family restaurant w great pizza & tasty fresh fish. We are from NY & appreciate a good pizza pie. We will definitely  return to this warm, pleasant & very efficient restaurant next year. Good luck & keep up the great presentation & delicious taste of the food.                                                Sue
5	I was visiting Phoenix and my cousin lives in Florence, so I took a drive over to see him and his wife who actually live in Anthem.  They were telling me about this new restaurant that opened on Thursday, and although I was hesitant to go, because I own an Italian Restaurant on Winter Springs Florida, I said let's give it a try, as I love to critique the competitors.  I must say that they are doing everything right.  The food is fresh, tasty and hot when it came to the table, and the Tomato Oil is "spot on"!  Such a nice little restaurant in the Community, I'm sure this will be a welcome establishment to all the surrounding neighbors.  Good luck to the Barker and Valentino's!!!
5	Finally a real Italian restaurant nearby where both the atmosphere and food are inviting and fresh. I have not only eaten at many great Italian restaurants and deli's back east, I have eaten in Italy as well and can tell you, these owners are doing it right. They are a welcome addition to other establishments who take their food quality serious. Feels great to have choices and even better to see the genre of Italian Food in the area redeemed!
5	After two strikes with the previous restaurants that occupied this space, we may have a hit on our hands this time! I stopped by here for lunch with my wife yesterday and we loved it. One thing that I noticed almost immediately was how much attention this place is attracting. When we ate here in the past (previous restaurants) , we NEVER saw any customers walk through the doors during our meal. While we enjoyed our lunch yesterday, I think we watched at least a dozen or more people come through the doors either as customers or curious about the menu. The staff here is extremely friendly and helpful, and so far our experience with the food has been outstanding. I tried the Italian combo sandwich, which is served on warm bread and tasted amazing. My wife had the eggplant parmesan sandwich and loved it. The portions were a little larger than we expected but we couldn't control ourselves and finished the entire plate. They have a really nice menu and we will definitely be coming back for dinner in the near future. Good to see a place like this with a bar that carries a nice wine selection. Definitely worth a visit!
5	We called for take out pizza.  We really enjoyed the pizza, good Italian sausage on it.  They said the wait was 25 mins but we picked up the pizza and got it home in less than 25 mins.  Good crust, could have had a little more of the good sauce and had lots of mozzarella!
5	Amazing!  I don't know what to say other than EVERYTHING was fantastic! I had the mussels appetizer and it was large and delicious. Sandwiches and salads at lunch are great. Dinners were perfect--Shrimp Fra Diavlo had the perfect amount of spice--YUMMM.  Everyone who I have come here with loves it. Can't think of any better Italian. Prices are VERY reasonable.  All dishes seem to be a hit with everyone who has eaten here with me. Mangiare (Eat)!!! And ENJOY! Great atmosphere also...beautiful bar.
5	Finally! We have a fine dinning establishment. I have eaten here now 3 times and perfect every time.  The pizza is great and of course the pasta is superb. The wait staff is very friendly. The food comes at a decent pace. Just can't say enough good things about this place. Please stop by and enjoy this restaurant. Support your local owners.
5	At last somewhere my wife and I can go as regular customers. You have to check this out if you live in the San Tan/Queen Creek or Florence area. We went last night with our family and it was great. We will be checking out the Sunday Brunch and lunchtime sittings too.Food - Excellent *****Service - Good ****Price - Low to Moderate $$We have every intention of going here on a regular basis.
5	Very Upscale DiningFinally! We have a fine dining establishment in the STV area. I have eaten here now and perfect.  The Veal is great and of course the pasta is superb.  The portions are over generous. The wait staff is very friendly and spot on. The food comes at a decent pace. Just can't say enough good things about this place. Please stop by and enjoy this restaurant. Support your local owners.BTW dessert was excellent.Food - Excellent *****Service - Good ****Price - Low to Moderate $$
5	Valentino's is always a delightful place to dine; not looking forward to winter visitors crowds. Food excellent!
4	Husband and I went here tonight for dinner and we were very pleased for the most part. Our server was pleasant and did a good job at explaining the menu and bringing out our order in a timely fashion. We started with the calamari and it was delicious. Light batter and not salty.I had the veal parmesan. It was good but a little over cooked. A little too crunchy around the edges making it hard to cut and I thought the marinara sauce was a bit bland. My husband had the cheese ravioli and he really liked it. For desert we shared a slice of cheese cake and it was very good. The potions are large so when I go back I will not order a starter. I'd rather have dessert all to myself and not share!! There were only three things I didn't like.....1. They have a tv in the corner with a football game on and it really bothered me even though it was muted. If I wanted to go to a sports bar for dinner I would've gone to The Gym. Why would a lovely quaint Italian restaurant even entertain the thought of putting a TV in their establishment? The food and the ambiance should be enough to get people in your door and back again. 2. They have seating along the kitchen area which is sectioned off by frosted glass. We were seated here and I didn't like listening to the clatter and chatter of the people preparing food. Next time I will sit on the other side of the restaurant. Maybe right underneath the TV so I don't have to look at it or have it in my peripheral vision.  3. The raspberry vinaigrette was way to biting! To much vinegar and not enough raspberry and sweetness. However , the salad itself was fresh and crisp.  The prices were reasonable and comparable to other eateries like this. All in all I had a good experience and will go back.
5	Very good food. Wife had prime rib and I had chicken rigga. Both were excellent. Wait staff was very friendly and always checking in on us. Highly recommend.
5	Excellent authentic Italian. Great staff. They even cater to our gluten-free needs. I highly recommend!!
5	Great staff. The server was amazing as was the cooking. The food delicious. We found this place on Yelp and I am making it my first review ever on the service. Great people, great atmosphere, and great food! Highly recommended!
3	This restaurant has a nice atmosphere. Very clean. Staff is friendly but don't go if you're in a hurry. It is like a traditional Italian restaurant where they allow for time to finish courses. That being said it took forever to eat and get out. The portions were huge, as well as the bill. I was disappointed, though with the taste of the food.  I had chicken fettuccini Alfredo. My husband makes a much better dish than theirs. First, they charged $2 extra for plain boiled chicken because it doesn't come with it. Gross. And the cheese on the fettuccini tastes as if it came from a jar. I was annoyed that it was so much money for something that tasted so gross.  I had a few bites and the waitress did not ask if we wanted it off the bill. Oh well. My husband had the egg plant Parmesan and he said it was mediocre. All in all, we were both disappointed with the food, being that it had such great reviews. We will not be going back.  I gave 3 stars because of the clean, ambient atmosphere and the waitress.
5	Wow seriously delicious you would never expect it but this place was awesome all around great service and great food will definitely be coming back here.
5	This is the best!!!. We seen this little place next to safeway and had been to the first two restruants in that location. And both were terrable food. Well this was the best Italian food in town bar none. We have found a new home for a great meal. Only down side we were seated on a two top next to walkway and bathrooms. Very poor table placement, but will not take that next  time. But over all very nice.
5	This was the second time we went to eat here and once again it was great. We are going to try the pizza the next time we go.
5	I live in san tan valley and I drive by 5 different pizza joints to get to this place. Best pizza I've had since I moved here from Philly. Also excellent Italian food and service.
