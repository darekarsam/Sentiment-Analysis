4	Although they don't offer much in discounts, this place has knowledgeable and eager employees and owner to help with any questions, help you load things in the car etc and do seem to carry a wide assortment of grills and accessories along with books etc. I really like the Barbeques Galore charcoal that they offer. It is a big bag. Lasted us a long time and is slow burning. Will be frequenting this place often.
1	They are very nice to you right up to the point you make a purchase.  If you have any issues with the purchase, good luck.
1	I will never step foot in this store again. Someone who works there, manager? owner? Thinks it is their god given right to park in the street just to the east of this store. So what happens is this car sits there and leaves enough room for only one car to pass. I've seen this on just about every Friday I go by the place on my way to another business next door.Now add in a landscaping crew with a giant truck and the road is completely blocked, making an already congested parking lot even worse.I used to shop here quite frequently but the arrogance of whoever this is just sealed the deal for me that I won't be back. Ever.
3	Having no luck finding a Weber Smokey Mountain, I drove a little further south to Barbecues Galore. Really, these two stores should switch names. BBQ Island does, indeed, have barbecues galore while this place is much smaller. They do have supplies, some grills and smokers on display, fireplaces and other stuff. It is just on a much smaller scale than their nearby competitor. The good thing is, normally, it is easier to have questions answered here. Also, they actually had the smoker I was looking for.
