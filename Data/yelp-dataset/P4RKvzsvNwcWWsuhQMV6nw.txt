5	So shockingly there isn't a YELP page for this, so I just made one. NBA Summer League is pure affordable awesomeness for any basketball fan so here we go.=========OVERVIEW=========NBA Summer League takes place at the end of the NBA Season, before the start of the new season. It's usually held during the month of July and is a chance for rookies and young players to pop their NBA cherry. It's purpose if for these players to get a chance to preview the NBA life on the court... (coaching, reffing, court time) ...to aid in their development. In addition many fringe players who WERE NOT draft or are not on any teams, get a chance to come out and try to make the team. It's a long shot but it's the last opportunities for these fringe players, usually consisting on NCAA College Players.=========LOCATION=========This page is for the LAS VEGAS summer league, which consists of most of the NBA's teams. Roughly 2/3's of the NBA's teams play here. The rest play in Orlando's summer league.It's held at the THOMAS & MACK CENTER, which is the home arena of the UNLV MEN'S BASKETBALL team.In side there's the COX PAVILLION which is a small sub-arena with like 30 rows on each side of the court. Then also under the same dome across the hall is the actually THOMAS & MACK ARENA which is huge, where the UNLV Men's team plays.BOTH arenas host summer league games,, usually at the same time with games starting within an hour of each other, allowing to to game hop.===============FINAL THOUGHTS===============NBA Summer League is amazing. For $25.00 you get to see UNLIMITED GAMES in both the Cox Pavillion AND Thomas & Mack Center. There's usually 8 games per day which is 16 different teams.Given that a decent NBA ticket is $75.00+ this is a deal.ALSO YOU GET TO SIT WHEREVER YOU WANT. 1ST COME, 1ST SERVE!!!So if you get there early enough, you can sit in the 1st row. (courtside seats are reserved / VIP)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nba-summer-league-las-vegas?filter_by_userid=True&select=ziCi0x1od97oT7QvwN9LDw&userid=1pgT-Eeh-GIOlhOgHMMRZA#i_wSvCVqKU1agRlsL53DxAAdditionally you get to see young NBA players, star rookies, players coming back from injury (Blake Griffin, JR Smith) ...as well as MANY NBA LEGENDS who come to watch and scout.Some of the players I saw last week (July 2013) the one day I went were:~ Ron Artest / Metta World Peace~ Jerry West~ Patrick Ewing~ Larry Johnson~ Tim Hardaway~ Chris Mullin~ Chris Webber~ Steve Smithhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nba-summer-league-las-vegas?filter_by_userid=True&select=ziCi0x1od97oT7QvwN9LDw&userid=1pgT-Eeh-GIOlhOgHMMRZA#kCx30W8x0HBLYRav5P0QUwCoaches: Tom Thibadou & Flip Saunders...In addition, Flip Saunders was sitting next to me, and as we were leaving I got to ask him some Kevin Love questions. Also CRAIG SAIGER (TNT FUNNY SUITS GUY) was sitting right next to me.Last off... there's several current NBA players and celebrities that pop in as well.
5	One of my favorite things about living in Vegas is checking out NBA Summer League! Plus, I got to watch my Golden State Warriors take home 2013's championship (perhaps the only championship I'll ever see them win in person in my lifetime haha) 2014 was definitely more packed, especially with the stacked draft that just happened and Lebron announcing his move back to Cleveland, a ton of people had their Lebron Cav jerseys out that they didn't set on fire. To maximize enjoyment, I highly suggest buying tickets at the box office a coupe of days before the event so you aren't left waiting in line and missing out on the action. If you know for sure you are going to want to attend a game on any given day, just buy the tickets ahead of time. This is a great event for kids who get to meet some well-known and up and coming players, but it can be draining if you aren't a true basketball fan. Rant: To the girls attending, wearing their Steph Curry jerseys, trying to look cute, and just walking around hoping to run into an NBA all-star and never actually watching the game, but constantly updating your FB page or IG page saying you are at summer league, please just stay home. One thing I really love about this event is the interesting sports fans you get to meet and the conversations you get to have with folks. People come from all over the place to be here since it's such  a great opportunity to see so much great basketball up-close. There's also one guy, who we refer to as "Farmar jersey" (he was wearing a Lakers Farmar jersey the first time we saw him), who sits really close to the front at games and calls the game like he's a sportscaster. I've seen him piss off so many people and guys actually want to beat him down because they were so annoyed, but he actually is pretty good at calling the game. I take it as one of the funny/exciting things about summer league, but just be warned!
