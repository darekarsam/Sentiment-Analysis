3	Pros: nice terrace on the pedestrian street Rue Prince Arthur, friendly staff, two for one beers during happy hour, delicious seafood bisque.Cons: Shrimp in my pasta dish tasted like they were from frozen, dessert that came with our table d'hote was an extremely dry yellow cake that tasted like it had been in their fridge for weeks, the wait staff's ability to speak English was extremely limited
1	Closed. The food must have been great.... no... couldn't have been... they are CLOSED! That's French for "the food sucked!"
