5	This place is great! We saved a bunch and we'll be sure to check them out again next time we need tires.
5	If you are looking for a place to save money on tires Champtires is definitely a place you should go! I first started using them last year when I needed all new tires for my Honda crv. It would have normally cost me $500 at least and with them I paid half! And the very thing I wanted most was quality and I never had a problem they were great! So fast forward a year and I'm working at a new company and we are talking about how one of my co workers needs tires and I found out that day that 5 other people I worked with had been going there for the past two years and they loved   It too....always great experiences! It really is such a great place with fantastic deals on QUALITY tires and they are extremely dedicated to service! So go!!!!! You'll never pay full price again I know it!
5	Great price, great service. They also mount the tires at their new location next to Hot Metal Harley. Much more convenient!!
5	Walking into tire/auto repair shops always make me nervous of being screwed over. This was NOT the case here. I could have had a more helpful experience. The staff listened to my needs and wants(american made tires). They met every condition I set within dollars of the price I was looking for. Will be coming back!!
5	Champtires is aces with me. The website is easy to navigate, and when a question came up about my order, they were quick to respond and very helpful. You know exactly what you're getting, and to top it all off, shipping is free! The tires arrived within a couple of days and looked even better than expected. I'm sticking with Champtires.
