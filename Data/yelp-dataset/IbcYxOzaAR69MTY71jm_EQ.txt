3	A very cute gift shop, with adorable and quirky gift ideas. However, as Emily T pointed out the price tags are quite high when you start considering the actual item on sale. Still Miam Miam can be a saver when you are stuck on a present for someone that's a bit more unique but not too crazy. When I came in here it was empty (coincidence or economic crisis effect?) but the staff are super friendly and I got a great card for my friends graduation.
4	I'm an absolute sucker for gift shops and I love browsing round them looking for inspiration but I usually leave with something for myself than for someone else. Miam Miam is an excellent little gift shop with quirky gifts, cards for all occasions and stationery all very well organised. Prices range from affordable to a bit pricier, but all gift shops are the same really and the stock here is really cute! The staff are friendly and Miam Miam is definitely worth a look if you're looking for a gift as they have a great selection of goodies.
