4	I've been coming here periodically for about 5 years. Up until this point all I've done is mail letters or whatnot - but now recently I've mailed some packages.One was a A/V Receiver. Heavy, bulky, and electronic. I can pack a box, but getting it there in a crumpled mess is a different story. So I just took it in and told em where to send it.  The bill wasn't pretty, but I didn't expect it to be a coupon clipper deal either.With that said, the staff was pretty good to me. They sure took their time and made it right, especially with that receiver.
