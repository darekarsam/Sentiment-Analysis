4	Nice place to sit outside for lunch, to have a meeting, or to read a book.  Only bad thing is when people bring their kids there to run and scream everywhere.
4	Such a pretty, relaxing feature to have downtown. I spend my lunch hour here when i pack.. I think it makes my ham & cheese sammich taste better :) (kidding)I've also been bringing my niece Amorah here for the last 3 summer. The first summer of course she was just a baby- maybe 7 months but we still hung out and cooled off. Last year she was two and i literally just chased her around the entire time. She loved it! if you decide to bring the kids (or even yourself) just a note that they can not wear bathing suits.. a simple tank and cotton shorts work fine, just bring extra clothes. Also you have to wear shoes so remember sandals or even water shoes. The jets are super fun and change height every few seconds so its exciting the entire time. Be prepared because every time from my experience, Amorah wants to stay 2 hours -_- maybe longer if we'd let her.
