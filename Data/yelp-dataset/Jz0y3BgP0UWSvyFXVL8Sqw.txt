5	Everyone is so friendly . I get my hair done by Sue Schatzberg & her work is absolutely amazing . I always leave very happy about my results. I tell everyone I know about her. So if you're looking for a great stylist ask for her. She has been doing  my hair for over 10 years and I wouldn't trust anyone else.
