4	Will and John helped us out when our camper van broke down in Vegas.  They set us up with a good price on a minivan and when we found out we'd have to drive back to San Diego they switched us into a different minivan that we could take to SD without any waiting.  I'm really pleased with the level of service we received from this enterprise location. They went out of their way to be friendly and helpful.
5	After a horrific experience with "another car rental company" last month, it was such a pleasure to return to Enterprise!I live very close to this location, so the picking up and dropping off were done quickly.  When I thought I'd be late in getting my rental, I was reassured that they would do their best to accommodate me.The car was clean and well maintained.  My trip (at least the driving part) was uneventful and the turn-in was drama-free.  I was correctly charged on my credit card and all is well.And, as someone did on another review, I'd like to apologize to Enterprise for cheating with another company.  I swear it will never happen again!
