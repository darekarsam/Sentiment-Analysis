2	When we arrived on time to our daughters procedure and they were able to get our info in asap, unfortunately the front desk staff was incredibly rude. One worker told us only one parent back with our preschooler at a time--not the experience I have had at other surgery centers in the valley. In the end the nurse said it was totally fine. We had some great nurses, but I also saw some nurses who seemed hurried and had little to no bedside manner. There was a young girl (6ish) who was coming out of surgery and began crying. The nurse reprimanded her "you're a big girl. That's enough. You're a big girl aren't you?" I couldn't imagine being that little girls mother and watching this happen. If I can avoid this place in the future I will.
1	Staff is rude and unprofessional.   After my procedure they were quick to ignore a progressing medical issue yet were great at taking my financial information.  It may be difficult to ignore this place since many surgeons use this location, but just ask yourself:  Is my safety less important than my convenience?
