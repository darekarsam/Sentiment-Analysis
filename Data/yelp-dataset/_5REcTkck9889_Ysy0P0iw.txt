5	Let's talk about the many, many reasons why I love Assorted Table Wine Shoppe.1.Any store that's retail pricing instead of four times restaurant mark up, makes me happy.  2. Community farm table, where you can socialize with Not Just Coffee patrons too!3. Knowledgeable, unassuming staff, you can be a total novice or an oenophile and you feel welcomed.4. Plenty of hidden gems, not just the everyday stuff.  We tried a Prosecco or some sort of bubbles from Barcelona (I think) for $26.  Delicious, obscure and affordable. #hellyeah5. My favorite Vermouth, Dolin.6. Location, 7th Street Market- great meeting place, where everyone can find something to drink/eat and be completely content.7. Outdoor seating8. Free parking for 90 minutes!9. A large selection of Bitters!All this talk makes me want to go there now!!!!
5	Kuya Josh!!!! We love your store! Your wine finds are truly a diamond in the rough! I love the sweet Shine Dornfelder! We want to get some more! You have us hooked on Moscato! Now, sweet red Shine Dornfelder is soooo tasty! It's our new fav added to the list! Your variety of sake is pretty good. I love the variety and the wine tastings you have over at your place! Keep up the great work! Your place is a total find! Every sip of wine has been worth the travel! All the bottles you have to sell are amazingly worth the buy! Every bottle you have is a great deal! We can't wait to go back and visit! We wish you were closer to Richmond!
5	The Bottom Line: I don't know the first thing about wine BUT thank you to the excellent service and very reasonable prices I have not put a foot wrong with my better half or with dinner guests. I can't offer better praise than that.
