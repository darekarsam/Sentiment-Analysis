1	I agree with Jimmy H.- AWFUL!Have been going here for quite a while so I was horrified to find 2 expensive sweaters in my last pick-up severely SHRUNKEN. The woman (owner) there also denied shrinking the sweaters and also tried to ignore me before I showed her the same sweater I had in a different color to one she shrunk. She continued to deny, said it was impossible, then tried to walk away several times. I was calm, and professional, but firm, and obviously upset. She proceeded to insist the sweater wasn't the same as the one I brought in (it clearly is) because the "material feels different". No kidding! The wool fibers have shrunk so much that it DOES feel different. And the tags on the inside are scrunched together due to the shrunken material around them. She inspected the tags in both the ruined and non-ruined sweater to see that the material and make were EXACTLY the same. Since this accusation wasn't working out, she then had the nerve to accuse me of washing it/shrinking them myself and blaming her. The tags they put on them were still on! I pointed this out to her and she tried to walk away again, but not after telling me that I "just want money". Well, they SHOULD reimburse me for ruining 2 beautiful sweaters. I will probably open a complaint with the BBB or try small claims court, just because I cannot believe someone would treat a customer like this after destroying their property. BEWARE!
1	Found bleach spots on 2 shirts. Went in 4 times to get it resolved because the manager wasn't there the 1st 3 times. Then she said "we don't use bleach and we didn't do this". Well I sure didn't ruin my shirts for fun, nor do I like to frequently stop by a place repeatedly for giggles. The manager/owner turned her back and walked away. Me= a couple hundred dollars down the drain. Nothing I can do and nothing they are willing to do or admit. DO NOT GO HERE!!!
