4	FIRST! This Port of Subs is great. I always joked with my co-workers about coming here because it's right across the street from the Spearmint Rhino, and one of my co-workers claims he has never been, or knows where it is. In any case, when it came time to visit this Port of Subs, he was too busy, so he gave my other co-worker and I his order.The sandwiches are spot on here. All the meats and cheeses are freshly sliced, and the bread is hand sliced all the way through. They have this mustard/mayo combination that I absolutely love.Great place for a sandwich.
2	Only my second time having Port of Subs and I can say that I am not a fan of this location. The other location was much, much better. This one is really small and I ended up eating just the insides of my sandwich because my bread was overdone and tasted funny. Went in around lunchtime and there was a bit of a line. I don't mind the wait but don't like feeling rushed when it is my turn which is exactly how the people doing the toppings made me feel. The staff was hit or miss... two of them seemed nice and friendly and the other two didn't seem like they were having a good day. They also lack some organization and if I have to tell the person at the register what I ordered that's probably not good because I can just say I ordered the cheapest one. +1 for the chocolate chip cookies being delicious!
4	Great place for lunch. It's hidden in a commercial business center but great place to pick up a good sandwich. I frequent the place for lunch and the ladies at the counter remember my favorite sandwich. Quick and efficient along with freshly sliced meat makes for a nice quick lunch.
