1	Kids area filthy, fries incredibly salty, tables dirty. Love this food chain, but go to another franchise location. Go to StoneCrest or another to get a much better experience.
4	This is your standard Chick-Fil-A - consistently good food with friendly staff.This Chick is located off of South Blvd in the same shopping center as a movie theater, Target, Old Navy, Bed Bath & Beyond, Kohl's, Michaels and a bunch of other stuff.  The traffic pattern in the center can be a bit of a cluster, but isn't that true of most shopping centers?  Coming through a little before 11:30 am on a Thursday, I drove straight up to the call box, ordered my #1, quickly paid and was on my way.  The condiments I requested were in the bag, the lack of pickles that I requested was honored and my tea was perfectly sweet.  Eat mor chikin!
3	Not only does this Chick-Fil-A serve the standard fare that you can find at other CFAs that you know and love - and they do it with the same friendly service as well - they also have an excellent patio out on the side., next to the play area. Definitely worth a visit.The only unfortunate thing is that you are in a parking lot, after all, but hey - at least you can sit in the shade while you partake in your awesomely fried chicken sandwich at lunchtime.
