5	I work in real estate so I frequent this store for keys and other small items.  The staff is friendly and easy to work with. When I need something it is always there and the staff is always ready to help me find it.  I recommend.
2	Ace Hardware is that store that usually has one of everything including those hard-to-find items. When Home Depot or Lowes doesn't have what you're looking for then you have no choice but to hit an Ace. This location is a good location. The employees are Johnny on the spot so finding things is a breeze and you're in and out in no time. Downfall, prices are ridiculous and they only take returns from their own location. Even though they have that major store name they're all independently owned and operated. Nothing is more frustrating than going out of your way to return something you've been holding onto for a while and then finding out because you didn't buy it there, they won't take it back even though it has their name on the product.  Unfortunately, Ace Hardware's are a necessary evil and you're looking to find those hard to find items. Can't say I won't ever come back but I will say that I will go the extra mile out of my way to time.
5	For me Ace is the best and this is the best of possibly a dozen I have been to over 35 years in the valley.Best in having more hardware items and experienced people. I don't know if it is good business but certainly helps consumers and repairers.Availability and knowledge trump price and niceties for me.
