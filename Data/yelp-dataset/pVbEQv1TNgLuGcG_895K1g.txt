2	Went here for years, and always just put up with 3+ hour service times for tire replacement. Often times I would walk to west towne mall and back and they still hadnt touched my car. They always seemed understaffed. Sure, I didn't always have an appointment but this place just sucks. A tire shop should be able to get "just tires" people in and out in a reasonable amount of time. One time I'm pretty sure I paid extra for a road hazard warranty, got a flat a few months later, brought it in and surprise! No warranty coverage....full price for replacement. Go to discount tire on junction rd instead.
4	I had 4 tires with 30k miles on them.  My problem was my car is 6 years old and the rubber was rotting.  I called ahead, let them know my situation.   They had 4 new tires on hand that fit what i needed...and on promotional price.  I drove in and all tires were changed within an hour.  I'd give them 5 stars if they would have told me they were gonna tinker under the hood...I was a bit upset to see them looking at my battery and fluid levels, but I asked them just to service the tires and nothing else and they accommodated.
4	Excellently priced tires and I didn't even need an oil change appointment today to get in right away! These guys rock and are serious about customer satisfaction, which means the most to me! :-)
4	Found my new oil change home here.Straightforward work and no pushy overselling.  Not even a transmission flush was suggested..... :)Was pleased to overhear an employee explain to a customer that synthetic allows you to drive well over 3,000 miles- closer to 6,000.  I have never overheard this at a shop.  Thank you for your honesty.I made an appointment so I didn't anticipate my oil change and rotation to take over an hour with the shop not seemingly packed, but if quality work takes a little longer and I'm not paying for a 15 minute change I'm certainly not going to get in a huff.
