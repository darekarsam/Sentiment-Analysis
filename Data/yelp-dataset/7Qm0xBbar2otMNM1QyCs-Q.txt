4	Stopped by for the first time this week.  The cupcake flavors are varied and interesting. I'm not a chocolate fan so I was happy to see plenty of non chocolate options.  These cupcakes are tall, too tall to fit in you mouth for a full bite so you have to do some creative nibbling. Nothing wrong with that. The cake is very good! Not too dry, not too dense. The frosting is a wee bit melty but definitely yummy. They may not look as perfect and beautiful as you may see at other shops, but they are delicious and the service was friendly.  3 cheers for the box with the cupcake shaped hole in it for cupcake stability!
4	These babies are ginormous! Perfect for when you are craving sugar.Reminiscent of those a grandma or cool aunt makes at home from scratch. I had the Mocha Mocha- chocolate cupcake with coffee topped with a coffee buttercream frosting. Very light on the chocolate taste. I can definitely taste butter. Super moist. The chocolate buttercream has a hint of coffee in it. It was very creamy.$3 per cupcake.
