5	My a/c went out Wednesday evening. By Friday afternoon, the new unit was up and running. The installers were respectful and cleaned up after themselves. The business owner, Chuck Knight, came out to inspect their work personally. He is a friendly guy who loves his work and does it with integrity. He gave me a good price and did not try to sell me any extras.I recommend him without reservation.
4	Our electric bill doubled. We called Knight after looking at HVAC companies that are Rosie on the House certified. Mark came out and looked everything over. He wasn't able to fix the issue (our fault), but he was able to disable the heater which was erroneously turning on with the AC.He also illustrated the fixes needed, along with non-essential, but valuable options to improve the system. Mark helped us out today, and we greatly appreciate it. Thanks Knight!
5	I've had Chuck service my units for years. They were cheap builder grade units and he made them perform better than they had in years.  When it came time to replace them, I had three reputable companies give me quotes. I brought Chuck in last and without knowing what the others bid, he came in well under their bids.  That made it so easy.  He put in some great units and had the keys to my house for a few days while they were in and out. I don't know of any other contractor I would trust absolutely with my home with no one home.  Choosing Chuck was a no brainer.
