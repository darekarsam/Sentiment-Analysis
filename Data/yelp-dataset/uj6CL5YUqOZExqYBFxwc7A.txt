1	Okay, so  I ordered a leaf blower at a different Sears last week and was told I could pick it up at he Pineville store. I showed up to find out they did not have the product. No idea why but a manager would be there to help me in a minute. After 15 minutes a nice young man showed up and said  "oh yeah we do not have that item". Okay but I paid for it and expect to get it. Okay we will order it on line and have it shipped to you and that will take  7-10 days. What a joke. No apologies or compensation for the delay. After I waited for 15 minutes for someone to actually acknowledge my problem. I haven't been to Sears in years now I  know why.
2	Okay so go to Sears to get my car worked on. I do oil changes mosty, but today I brought tires. My biggest issue here is their slowness. Took a good 5-10 for someone to greet me and say I'll be right with you. As well as the checking out process. I'm unsure if the problem was disorganization or if they were short in staff.My wait for the entire process was maybe an hour and a half. I would return but I hope the next time is a better experience then this.
