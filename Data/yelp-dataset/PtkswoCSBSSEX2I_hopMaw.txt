4	Made my quarterly visit to The Belgo last Saturday. There's always a few shows that delight. Among my favorites this time around - Bettina Forget, Anne Ramsden at Galerie Sas, Joe Lima at Galerie Nicolas Robert, a gorgeous Giacometti print highlights the Galerie Roger Bellemare and Galerie Christian Forget group show. I may make it a monthly visit!
4	It really doesn't look like much from outside, or when you first walk in. I almost thought this is just some office building - but don't be fooled! Most of the art is hidden away on the upper floors, and it's definitely worth coming in to explore all the little galleries that line the halls. There's always something new and interesting to see. It's free, too!
4	Bummer! I wish I had the same lovely experiences that have been recounted here. Unfortunately most gallery spaces didn't open until noon when I was there on a Tuesday at 11, and many were closed, changing exhibits, or just simply didn't seem like places to pop in. I adore the concept and recommend anyone do their research and learn about upcoming openings, because the concept itself is quite fantastic. I just wish I had the opportunity to see more while I was there, and look forward to a future visit when I can take it all in.
