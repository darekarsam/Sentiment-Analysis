5	Cave Creek finally has it's own CrossFit box! This is a brand-new, state-of-the-art facility with the MOST dedicated coaches. I was new to the CrossFit ideology but both Santana and Aaron went above and beyond to accommodate my needs. They're just the right blend of motivational and educational, and after just a few short weeks, I've seen major improvements in my body. Doesn't get much better than this. Do yourself (and your body) a favor and check them out!
5	Cave Creek Crossfit is THE place for the an athlete who isn't a professional but wants a professional-grade workout.  Santana and Erin teach you the finest nuances of every movement and the classes are filled with great competitors who you'd be comfortable having a burger and beer with after a workout.  Hey, we are real people at CCC!
5	At first I didn't know what to expect. After just a few classes I realized that these workouts are for every level of fitness and are challenging but appropriate for my fitness level.  The instructors, Santana and Erin, are fantastic at explaining the techniques and scaling the workout to my capabilities.  It is like having personal training and the results have been fantastic!!
5	Great place for ultimate workouts! If you are serious about losing weight and/or getting your body in top shape, this is one of the best gyms I have ever experienced. Santana will challenge you to push beyond your comfort zone. I'm glad he does since I'm in better shape than I was in my 20's!
1	Horrible ownership. Notorious for overblling. Horrendous customer service. The trainers themselves are very good. The ownership and administration is an absolute disaster.Stay away is all I can tell you.
