1	Even slower than Walgreens and at least walgreens will fill your prescription from off site without making you drive across town to another pharmacy to get a prescription filled.
1	The prices at this store are much higher than other similar stores.The staff is EXTREMELY rude, unhelpful, even "heckling" customers at times.  One little older lady left the store in tears due to treatment of employee ASHLEY.Please choose a different store!
2	This store has to be the worst CVS ever. All I want to do is pick up my pictures and the guy who is playing manger has no idea what he is doing. Next time I am going to order my pics from snap fish.
5	This CVS is the reason why my faith in humanity has been restored. When coming back from the doctor's office after taking in my son my normal pharmacy called me to inform me that they didn't have his antibiotic in stock and it would take 2 days to fill so I opted to go to Walgreens up the street and called them and needles to say they were horrific! They even hung up on me as I was asking questions. At the time I was new to the area and on the bus so I took a leap of faith and got off when I saw this store and went in. They were so amazing, they filled my son's prescription and even called my other pharmacy for me and got everything squared away. I now have a car and will drive the extra half mile just to go to this store.
