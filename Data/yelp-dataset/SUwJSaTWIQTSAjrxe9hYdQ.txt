5	Page c. Has no clue.she tosses out bad reviews like they are going out of style. I just purchased an EGO e-cig. This thing was only 29.99 and it has been the best thing ever. I have had it for 5 hours and have almost thrown my cartons of reds out. Its going to take a little bit but this thing works. Thank you so much gentlemen. These guys are to the point and have the knowledge and skill to rival any shop in the valley. Glass?????? yes. The best range of pipes in the state in my opinion. For being privately owned and operated these guys and gal have a huge selection ranging from $5 hand pipe to a $650 Art piece. I love it and you should to. Go and see.
5	Love this place!! Friendly gentlemen that work there are always respectful and know about what they sell. Good selection of pipes,bongs exc and there tabacco is at a good fairly price. Love it close to home also!
5	For a smoke shop I was really happy that this place smelt really clean. The employees we're real non-confrontational or pushy. The prices, which I was surprised, was just a lil cheaper then most places I've been to, not like crazy cheaper, but just competitive enough to make going here worthwhile.
5	Thank you Nick for helping us resolve the issue with our purchase!! SUPERIOR Service. Happy happy. :-)
