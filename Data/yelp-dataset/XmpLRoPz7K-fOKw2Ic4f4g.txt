3	Visited EQ3 for some decor ideas. It was OK, very contemporary (which doesn't happen to be my style), but overall nothing spectacular about this place. They had some items priced reasonably, but lots that I felt were overpriced for what they were. I would keep this place in mind, but look elsewhere first.
4	EQ3 is an eclectic mixture of modern furniture and decor.  Although I can't afford them at the moment, I love their furniture designs and love getting ideas on what my house could possibly look like.  They carry items that most furniture stores don't carry.  Boo to traditional -- yea to modern!  A friend of mine bought a glass-top computer desk there and it looked great set up; almost like decor rather than a furniture.  A few times throughout the year, you can find some awesome sales at EQ3.  I've gotten some nice huge glass frames there for art museum prints for about $20 each.  They look like I spent a lot more on them than I did!  Their dishware can be found on sale, too, at great prices, but -- alas -- I'm set in the dishware department.
