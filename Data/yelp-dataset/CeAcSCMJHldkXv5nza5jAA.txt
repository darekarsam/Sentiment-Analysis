5	I have to say that SW Blinds & Shutters is an awesome company. James has worked with me on 2 homes now in the last year and a bit and has delivered each time! With a fantastic product line, expert knowledge and installation I couldn't have asked for more. SW has great competitive pricing and I wouldn't hesitate to use them again! Quality and Service is top notch and I highly recommend James and his team!
5	We just bought a new home and received a referral to James at Southwest Blinds. I called him and he came out to measure windows and prepare a free quote within one day! What service! He came prepared with a large selection of samples and provided professional insight and recommendations. I did check with another company for a quote, however, I was less than pleased with the service and follow up. Southwest Blinds had much better pricing that included installation, as well! James returned, reviewed our initial meeting, and completed the necessary sales documents. The blinds were ordered and installed within two weeks! James did a wonderful job from start to finish. We love the blinds and highly recommend James and his company, Southwest Blinds.
5	I recently purchased some Plantation Shutters from Southwest Blinds and Shutters.  The service I received was phenomenal.  From Kelly who came out to show me the selection they had and measure the windows, to James Hutchings the president of the company. They were here on time and were extremely courteous. The installation was a breeze and the end result... Beautiful shutters! I highly recommend the professional and friendly group of people this company represents.
