1	Alert: do not come here for immigration. This place is a joke, I have paid over $7,000 to get my husbands immigration paperwork completed. They are very rude, don't return phone calls, very unorganized (to the point of forgetting to pick up the mail to there 2 locations). The sloppiness of this office has delayed our case further and now I am in the process of transferring my file to someone else. Once you pay you will never see the attorney!!!!!!! Only the paralegals which they don't even have schooling or know what they are doing. Find a good attorney not a mediocre one.
1	i'm only giving this place 1 star because of mr.diggs, he was nice and very helpfull.. beware do not use this place. they are all very rude. doesn't know how to return phone calls. and they take a long time processing your paperwork. very unprofessional. their only nice in the beginning and when you tell them your done using their company they turn very mean... now how are you to recommend to other people if their attitude is like that.i will never recommend them to anyone ....
