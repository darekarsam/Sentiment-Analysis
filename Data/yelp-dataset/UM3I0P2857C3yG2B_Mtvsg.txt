4	Since 7-11 is like wal-mart, u pretty much know  where to go when u get in there.  So without fail I knew exactly where to go but the difference is always in how ur treated and for a gas station I must say good job.  I'm done.
4	Oh thank Heaven! LOL.This place is super close to my apartment! I go here when we are on our way back from the gym, bc I usually ready to die and need some oj! I like the sandwiches z9the fresh 711 brand) that they have here. The turkey with chipotle mayo is yummy!The clerks here are nice and the place itself is clean. They also have a Redbox.  Come here if you need some candy or a quick bite to eat!
2	Tiny gas pumps and a Redbox kiosk. When I say "tiny" gas pumps, I mean there are four clumped together so close that really only one car can be on each side at a time. But most 7-11s don't have gas pumps in the first place, so it evens out.Service inside is quick, people are in and out fast, and concessions area is organized. Not one of the seedier convenience stores, but I've only been here during daylight hours- seems to be mostly a neighborhood stop for quick snacks or items you forgot at the grocery store.
