5	Great pizza & wings! The staff was very friendly. I will for sure be back to try more of the food.
5	Oh. My. Gosh. Some of the best Italian food I've ever had (and I'm Italian). The fettuccine Toscana (with chicken and artichoke hearts) is PHENOMENAL. Highly recommend!!
5	Came here before Thanksgiving to get some pasta and was not disappointed.   My wife is gluten free so she ordered the chicken picata with a side of spinach. I had the pasta giovanni.  Both were excellent.   The food was serve hot and fresh.  Our server named Teresa was also  very nice.  Had the bread pudding but that was just okay.  Bourbon sauce was a tad too thick and bread pudding was a bit bland.  Could use some cinnamon and fresh whipped cream.
5	LOVE THIS PLACE..The pizza is amazing and the staff is friendly
