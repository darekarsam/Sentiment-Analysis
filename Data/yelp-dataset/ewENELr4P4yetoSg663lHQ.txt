5	If you are looking for a GREAT dentist in the Goodyear area, you will not be disappointed!  A true gem!  The office is beautifully decorated and well maintained (clean).  Love the state of the art equipment!   Dr Jay and his staff are very professional and always friendly.  I did not feel rushed and did not feel pressured with Dr Jays recommendations.  Most important, I was seen ON TIME!
