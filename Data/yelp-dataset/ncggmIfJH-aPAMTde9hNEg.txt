Tucked away within a gated, resort-style community, it was voted the Best Master Planned Community in America by the National Association of Home Builders when it opened in 2001. The Club is the heart of the country club community and consistently provides the private family club lifestyle that you can afford.Locally, Anthem is known as the Club with two of everything -- two championship golf courses, two golf practice facilities, two spectacular clubhouses, two dining rooms, two state-of-the-art fitness centers, two heated pools, and two tennis gardens. Social Membership is an integrated part of the homeowner experience for residents of the country club community. For residents of Anthem Parkside and beyond, residents can request an invitation to a variety of memberships including Dining, Tennis, Off Season Golf and Full Golf Memberships.Anthem Golf & Country Club is a member of the ClubCorp family, the World Leader in Private Clubs.
