2	This is McDonalds!!! Nothing good to expect!Dont wanna lie so here's a honest Review.McDonalds has many stores but the quality of their food is low. Quantity over Quality!
1	I think they took all the workers from other McDonalds that were going to be fired and put them all here. The 3 times I went there they screwed up my order.  They can't even make a simple coffee.  Never again
1	How can you strike and expect $15 an hour when you can't even get an order correct on a slow night when I'm THE ONLY car in he drive thru?  Simple order. Not complicated. You even repeated it back to me and it printed out on my receipt, yet you missed ALL the sauces that were printed on the receipt and half the sandwiches! And then,, you lied to my face and told me that everything was in the bag after I asked. Bullshit.
