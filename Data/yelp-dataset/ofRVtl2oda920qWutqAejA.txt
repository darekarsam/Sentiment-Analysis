5	Best neighborhood pharmacy hands down. Fast, courteous and knowledgeable both Dr. Ly and staff are 5 stars plus in my book. Corporate pharmacies have long lost their "connection" with the average consumer, often being cold and appearing as if they are in an assembly line. At VIP Pharmacy, they go out of their way to listen to your questions and provide useful suggestions. I really felt like a VIP at VIP Pharmacy. All it will take is one visit and you will see why this place should be your go to pharmacy.
5	Best pharmacy ever- Fast, friendly, fair prices and no hassle.  You will never go to walgreens or cvs again!
