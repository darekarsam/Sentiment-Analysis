4	I finally got fed up of not owning a printer and the hassle which comes from not having one. My dad bought me an impressive Dell one when I started uni and it lasted about 4 months before it died. And it cost around 50 quid to buy ink for too.So I hunted around on the internet before deciding this PC World was a good bet. The shop is pretty huge and stocks everything from digital cameras to the standard computer. There was plenty of staff wandering around, and we managed to have a good look before one of them pounced. There is nothing more off putting than someone pouncing on you as soon as you walk in the door.The nice young man helped me to decide between the cheapest ones, pointing out all the features. I appreciated the fact he realised I was going to buy the cheapest one there so he didn't try sell the super expensive ones to me.He then picked it up, took me to the cash register and that was that. Even threw in some small talk. Thank you, come again!
3	I don't know about you, but that damn theme tune is in my head now. PC WORLD!! you know the one.Well you can't really go wrong with it can you? It's a world of PCs. But now it's branched out...I bought a rather good TV here the other day. Wayhey, good for you PC world.the staff are pretty dull in here though, it must be said. You get your token store manager who is enthusiastic about everything, a-la-Ricky Gervais' Office persona, but still. It's nice to see that 60s mantra is still going strong!!For all your PC needs, it's PC WORLD!! (...that damn tune)
2	Certainly not the cheapest place for 'puter stuff but they do have just about everything and they are open when other places are not.For goodness sake never say you are buying for business use when at the till, you will be there for the next 10 minutes answering questions for their records.
