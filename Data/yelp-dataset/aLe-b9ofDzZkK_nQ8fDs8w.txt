2	Came here looking for some prizes for something that we have to put together for my daughter's school carnival. I thought it would be like your neighborhood Dollar Tree but I was mistaken. This place is pretty big, pretty messy, and downright disgusting.I didn't make it up and down every aisle since I was trying to find only one or two things. From the looks of it, at least 1/3 of the store is food. I saw a lot of employees stocking shelves. They also have a lot of cheap art and school supplies, kitchen items, even single pairs of ladies undergarments hanging on hangers.Yeah...I won't be back.
4	One day about 2 years ago to cheer my mom up I gave her plant from this store. When I gave the small potted flower to her, I was very clear to not have high expectations since it came from the 99 cent store. Shockingly, to my surprise, that silly little plant grows back strong and cheers her up yearly now.I used to visit this store more when Fresh and Easy was right next door. Sadly, I have been here less since it closed. Since my previous visits, the store seems to have expanded upward and has many more products. They have a large refrigerated area in the back and now a ton of wine too. Another one of the reasons I enjoy this store so much is because they always have a large amount of holiday decorations no matter the holiday. A huge requirment I look for in a 99 cent store. Birthday balloons, fun toys, festive garland, various wrapping paper, shiny bows and random sparkly things you didn't think you need but now somehow you do. Thanks for the awesome Spiderman sandwich carrier, btw! All of these items live at this store. The employees are friendly and helpful. Perhaps, maybe a little too talkative, but sure, let's have a conversation during check out like I'm at Dutch Bros. Very pleasantly pleased after my many visits so thanks for being so stellar!
