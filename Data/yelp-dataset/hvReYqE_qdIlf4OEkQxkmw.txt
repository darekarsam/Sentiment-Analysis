2	This TB is in need of a serious remodel or just demolish & rebuild.  Food & staff are fine; the facility is horrible and very HOT in the late afternoon Phoenix sun.
5	Friendly service. They were spot on with the special requests I asked with my order. They made sure to offer sauces and did no ice in my drink per my request. The food came out quick. What more could I ask from Taco Bell
3	I always opt for the Taco Bell breakfast menu items if I'm feelin' fast food in the morning. As I'm checking in at this location I speak with a gentleman that has a standing bicycle outside. I asked him if it's on a bike rack, indeed it's not. So I tick the Yelp question "no bicycle rack" and he continues to explain that he's had several expensive bicycles stolen in as many months?! Unbelievably, a kid enters the west entrance only to make his way exiting the north entrance and stops at the mans bicycle?! After closer inspection he decided the bike isn't worth the grand heist and moves on. On this visit, which was done in they forgot an item on my order. Also, if your an adult an you order the orange juice, expect to be disappointed as to the size :-/
5	I always choose to drive past the ghetto TB at 4402 W Glendale in Glendale to eat at the nicer location at 35th and Glendale Ave in Phoenix. It's right next to QT. This location deserves 5 stars just on customer service alone!!! Someone I met that used to work at both locations agreed with me that things are run a lot differently in Glendale than they are in Phoenix.
