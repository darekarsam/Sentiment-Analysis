4	Delicious large soft pretzels here.  Very filling though, seems like they use a lot of butter.
5	After seeing the Brad Garrett show, we stopped by to get the jalapeno pretzel and lemonade.  It was fresh and delicious.  When I'm at MGM, I typically stop by and always happy I did.
4	I love this pretzel place!The pretzels are big, sweet, and (usually) soft! I also love their lemonade. It is seriously delicious.The service could use some work. I'm not a big fan of the "fuchi face," but other than that this place is great!
3	When I think of pretzels, I think of Auntie Anne's or Wetzel's Pretzels. I never heard of these guys until we got tickets to KA and we just happen to walk by them coming in from the parking structure. It just so happens were an hour early and we were hungry so that wan not enough time to eat an actual meal so we settled on a pretzel dog and almond crunch pretzel along with a large drink..How it tastes is very close to the above mentioned. As for the price, we spent almost 15 bucks on all three items including tax. Now I don't remember spending that much altogether coming from a pretzel place so I yeah, these guys are bit pricey. I guess since its in a casino, it's marked up just a tad.Service was a bit slow even though there were 3 people behind the counter. It was not like there was a long line of people getting pretzels. Matter of fact, there were only 2 people ahead of us but from some odd reason it took them a while to get their order.Nevertheless, we scarfed it down and went on our merry way to go see KA.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #43
