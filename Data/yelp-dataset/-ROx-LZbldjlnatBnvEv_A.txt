5	My last review focused on the events of one Saturday morning when, wanting to look all pretty for a wedding reception the following day, I decided to get my hair coloured in one hairdresser, and then cut at Neil Barton...as you may already have read, the colour went badly wrong!By the time I got to my hairdresser, Robbie, later in the morning I had puffy eyes from all the tears, and sadly explained the horrible experienced I'd had with my colour. He had a good look at it, explained what went wrong (too many highlights on one side & straight peroxide had been used on quite a dark brown apparently!) and declared "I can fix this!"...I almost kissed him!Now, the reason I got my hair coloured somewhere else in the first place was that Neil Barton were quite busy that day, and couldn't fit me in for both cut & colour. But Robbie felt sure it would only take him a short time to fix it and we could fit it into the time. He was absolutely right!.First, we had a good discussion about the style I wanted, then he gave me a wonderfully thorough cut before sorting my colour out for me! He was right, it DID only take about 15 mins to fix (which again leaves me quite suspicious the other place told me they didn't have the time to fix it until 6 days later!) and I was ecstatic with the results! Although still lighter than I'd previously had it, the colour had been broken up with my own colour to make it less obvious, and the highlights were blended in well...it was lovely! The cut was also exactly what I wanted too! The price was so reasonable, and I was given an NHS discount. Robbie got a good tip & the promise of receiving my first born child (I really was THAT happy!)This salon has a really great atmosphere, and the staff are so friendly and helpful. I will definitely not be going anywhere else for my next cut and colour! It really is a pleasure to come here...not least because they helped turn this very sad Yelper into a ridiculously happy one!
