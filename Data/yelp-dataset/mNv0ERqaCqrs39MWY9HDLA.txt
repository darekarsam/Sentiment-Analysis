5	Awesome!  No contract, no ridiculous fees, they don't pester you to have a service done.  He comes when we need and only when we want him to.  We've been with them for two years.  No complaints.
1	I am not satisfied with this company. I choose them among other pest control company in groupon since I thought they are easy to deal with because their name is a bible verse. But I was wrong. After I purchased the voucher in groupon I called them to make an appointment. But the person I talked to on the phone wanted me to call groupon and ask for a refund and then I should just go deal with them directly. He wanted me to pay $35 (for a special price) but I bought the groupon voucher for $20 so he was scheming by telling me that the service I bought from groupon is not the service I needed. But it said in the voucher that the voucher is worth $40. I guess he just wanted to get more money. I would not recommend this company. The name is deceiving so I would not deal with this company anymore. In the first place why advertise in GroupOn but then when the client bought it and call for an appointment you will scheme them to buy a more expensive service. I just don't get it. PLEASE beware of this company.
5	Absolutely the best pest control service we've ever used in SoNV!Through the years, we've used 5 or 6 companies, and we have no interest in switching now that we've hired the guys at Luke 10:19. They are always polite, prompt, and well-kempt. They are super-flexible with payment, and have even made a special trip out when I forgot to leave their check. Scheduling is easy since Steve sends us a courtesy text once a month. The months that we want a service, I simply reply to his text, and they're out within a couple of days.Absolutely zero complaints!Bonus: We love being able to support a Christian-owned company that does good work. And extra points for the pest-related Bible verse for which the company is named.  =)
