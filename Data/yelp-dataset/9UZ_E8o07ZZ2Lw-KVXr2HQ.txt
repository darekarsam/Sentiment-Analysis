5	This place is awesome especially for lunch! Off of Sossaman and Guadalupe right in the corner of the shopping center it sits, a hidden gem! $5.95 for the lunch special, soup, salad, fried rice, crab puff, spring roll, and your entree. If you think Panda Express has the best orange chicken May Flower blows this place put of the water. All white meat orange chicken, may mouth is watering! Lunch special is served from 11 to 3 everyday!
5	Where do I start?  If you are hungry for lunch... and in the mood for Chinese food, you HAVE to stop by.  You can't go wrong with any of their lunch specials though I am partial toward the orange chicken.  Soup, salad, and an entree that they do not skimp on.  It is made a little differently than I have had it anywhere else.  Chicken cooked just right, with a nice crunchy breading with excellent sauce.  I still return to this place when I am visiting after I moved to Seattle because I enjoy it that much.I also have to mention, I am out of there under $7 to $8 bucks, drink included!  (Though I tip well!)
