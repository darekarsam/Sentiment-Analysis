5	Jules is an awesome boutique right in Lawrenceville! Super cool vibes as soon as you walk through the door. Julia (the owner) is so helpful and will direct you to whatever you're looking for and answer any questions you have. Really cool line up of men's clothing too.
1	This is absolutely the worst customer service experience I have ever had in my entire life.  From the moment that I stepped into the door, I was greeted by nothing but the cold shoulder and the tapping of text messages being sent.  Words to the owner about surviving in retail, the business is all about how you treat the people who walk in.
5	We can talk all day about how many great breweries are opening up, but what about the boutique scene!? We've really got some fabulous shops popping up in the Burgh!I must admit, It took me a while to come in here. Truthfully, I was a little worried I wouldn't be able to afford it. While there are pretty expensive items here, I found things that I was comfortable spending my money on. Were the things I bought sale items? Yes! But I did see regular priced items on the very high end, and some that weren't too bad. I was very excited to see one of my fave designers, House of Harlow there, as well as dogeared jewelry. I'm excited to check things out season to season.... Okay, let's be honest. I'll be there sooner than that!

5	Thoughtfully curated selection of men's and women's clothes. Small boutique - smart and hip without being hip*ster*. I bought a Fred Perry cardigan there that I am wearing probably 3 times a week now. Big win!
5	I love both the mix of clothing and price points that Jules carries. They hosted a vintage jewelry trunk show (for my company Sweet & Spark) last year and we had such a great turnout. The owner, Julia is awesome to work with!
