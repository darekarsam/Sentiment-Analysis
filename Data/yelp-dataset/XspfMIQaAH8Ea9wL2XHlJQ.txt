4	FINALLY!A sandwich place in the Mile-End that serves good food at a great price.  Service was fast and friendly.I picked up the Shish Taouk Chicken Sandwich.  It's more of a pita roll but great for a quick bite.  If you want something filling, you'll have to grab something from the Platter menu.  The sandwiches are definitely for quick food and not to fill you up.I give it a 4 out of 5 because the food was good, but not amazing.  But that's what you're getting for the price.
4	A fair price with a smile and thoughtful touches. Very simple bare bones decor. The vegetarian benedict with avocado is delicious, as is the coffee. A friend of mine calls this place "One Man Show" because it's been the same fatherly, dignified, friendly figure working counter, tables and kitchen for years. Sometimes one man is all you need.
4	Closed down in 2012! This was an amazing hole in the wall with the best veggie benedict I've ever had. Sad to see the "One Man Show" disappear.
