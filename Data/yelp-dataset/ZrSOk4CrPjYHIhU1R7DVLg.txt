4	Beautiful cemetery, located acrossed the street from Hohokam Park, the former Chicago Cubs Spring Training facility. This cemetery is a big place, but well maintained. My dad and I went here upon hearing that one of our favourite musicians, Waylon Jennings, is buried here and we wanted to pay our respects to him. It may seem creepy going to a cemetery for this reason, but we didn't see it that way at all. It was something different to do, certainly, but going to pay homage to someone you admired is nothing to be ashamed or feel creepy about, last time I checked anyway.
