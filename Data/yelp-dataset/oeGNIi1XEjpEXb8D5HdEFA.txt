4	The store layout is exactly the same as most Walgreen. My favorite part about this store are the Pharmacy staff. They are awesome. They remember names, quick, and takes time to help you. Love it!
1	Went to this location down from the one on McDowell to get some asthma pills and again they have cards in the slots and again they were out. TAKE THE DANG CARDS OUT when you don't have the product.
5	I've been to this Walgreens twice with my Service Dog. They were so much more polite. On both occasions, the pharmacy staff even offered to give her a treat. It might be worth my while to just drive the extra distance to be treated with dignity at this store instead of the 107th/McDowell Location. I appreciate the kindliness and courteous behavior of the staff.
