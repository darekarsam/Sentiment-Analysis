2	Eck. i feel like this is the worst Dunkin Donuts ever. Different from the one in Asia, New york and Boston..I got an iced Mocha, and it was GROSS. Too Sweet and it wasn't smooth from some reason.The munchkins are still okay...Service a little bit weird. The cashier doesn't seem to be happy working there at all.
1	I had the frozen microwave flatbed bread chicken sandwich my buddy Darnell had the south west steak burrito The frozen microwave chicken was not very goodNor was the frozen microwave steak and egg burrito
2	NOT A FULL DD...AVOIDI have been here twice getting my car washed and while Dunkin Donuts has a pretty safe floor, the manager here seems to have a real problem with stocking. Both times I've been here I ordered my favorite sandwich which comes on a french roll and both times they were out of french rolls. Ok, fine...give it to me on a plain bagel. But wait, they're out of plain bagels too! Both times!I get that in the large scheme of things this is really a minor problem, and the food was still pretty good. It is what it is, but as far as DD's go, this one is pretty weak.
