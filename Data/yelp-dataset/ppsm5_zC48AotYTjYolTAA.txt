5	We went here on a whim. We were looking at different places to go and ended up here. I must say, we were lucky to end up here. The elevator takes you up to the top floor where the club is located. The view from the club is breathtaking. The music that night was beyond amazing. The DJ played the most amazing mix of music I have ever heard at any club, from soca, to reggae, to hip hop, to dance. The crowd was a good mix, mostly students I'm guessing from the nearby university. All in all, a great place to end your night.
3	I was expecting more from a place from with the novelty of being a club located on the 43rd floor of a building with breathtaking views of Montreal.  Other than the awesome view of the city, friendly/attentive staff and rooftop terraces, I left less than impressed. Perhaps it was the weather and lack of people that came that attributed to the letdown I experienced.The crowd was a little younger and seemed to be just there for the sake of being there.  This place most cater to either rich international students or pretentious college kids who like to buy a table service smaller than a desk for 15 people. It was seriously obnoxious getting around them.  The music is what made me want to leave. It simply was way too loud and sucked so bad that only a few people were dancing.  There was no rhyme or reason to how the music was put together and perhaps no strategy either. I've heard better DJs at a frat party. They had at least 4 guys behind the DJ booth and you think one of them would have been good at it. This place over-relies on it's concept than actually being a good club. I'm willing to give the place another chance and I'm sure once it gets warmer the place will be packed.
