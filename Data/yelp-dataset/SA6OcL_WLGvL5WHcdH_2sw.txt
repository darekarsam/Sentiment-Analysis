4	This Salon is just right up the street from me, and I have never been inside!  I received a coupon for a fee haircut, Yes! Free! Sue, was very nice, and took her time cutting my hair, I will difinitely go back! She just moved here, from Rhode Island, and wanted to build up her clientele, so decided to run the Free Coupon!  She normally charges $40.00 for a haircut and style!
5	My mom was visiting and wanted a haircut.  She went to Eva and got the best cut I have ever seen on her. She has been getting tons of compliments on her new style. I guess now she'll have to come down and visit more often.
5	I am so pleased with my haircut from Cindy, the owner.  She listened to exactly what I wanted, and the cut turned out beautiful.   What a nice and welcoming place!   I highly recommend coming here. I just moved in to the area, and am happy to find a place I can return to.
5	I had a Brazilian Blow Out with Cyndi, the owner.  She did an awesome job and gave me lots of tips about how to better care for my hair.  Best of all, she completed the entire process in less than two hours (I have very thick, shoulder length hair.)  Cyndi is an experienced veteran in the hair care industry and knows her stuff.  She is very easy to talk to and quite personable. The Salon is very busy, so call ahead for an appointment.   If you live in the McDowell Mountain Ranch/DC Ranch area, you should definitely give Posh Salon a try.
5	Have been coming to posh for years, they just moved to a new location at bell and Thompson peak.. The location is great! Cyndi the owner and stylist is fantastic!
5	Cindi is a stellar hair stylist!  She knows just what to do to make my hair fabulous.  And don't even get me going on the extras, such as jewelry, makeup and other products Posh has to offer.  Everyone at Posh is always so friendly.  It is a great place to meet new people as everyone that goes there is so nice and open to conversation.  Congrats Cindi, keep up the great work.
