5	Thanks JuiceUp 412 for providing healthy alternatives in my neighborhood. Whenever I'm feeling tired or unfocused I can always count on JuiceUp 412 to provide me that boast of energy. I would recommend for folks to visit the Livermore for Juice in the day. Many of us drink coffee for that pick me up. But I'm telling you fresh juice is so much better for you and has a similar effect. So one day try a fresh juice from JuiceUp instead of coffee and see how the results differ.
5	Best juice ever. this is a great addition for EAST LIBERTY!!!
5	I love the atmosphere of their space! It looks upscale, feels cozy, and delivers some tasty juice. I had a Beet Ginger juice-- the ingredients tasted fresh and I loved the thick consistency. My friend had a ginger lime juice, and I found it to be too watery.The Master Juicer of the day came out and had us test a super fresh ginger, green apple punch in the mouth. It was the most perfect shot of juice to bring you to your senses or possibly even out of a coma. I'll be waiting to see that on the menu so I can give up coffee for good.
