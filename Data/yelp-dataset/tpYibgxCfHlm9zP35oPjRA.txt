4	Great ambiance and great food for the Dix30. The chef is passionate about the non-pizza items.
4	This newly opened restaurant is a great place at the Square, Dix30. I went there on lunch time during weekdays. Ambiance is really nice with wooden ceilings, nice architecture, cozy feeling. I shared bruschetta as an antipasto (appetizer) with a friend.Among a wide range of cold and hot pizzas, we first ordered Parma pizza, which has tomatoe sauce, prosciutto, aragula and parmesan. Then, we had Capicollo pizza, which has tomatoe sauce, capicollo, green olives and peppers. Pizzas were beautiful, made from fresh ingredients and had thin crust. They were also big enough. I couldn't even finish mine.
4	Amazing pizza! The crust is perfect! The pasta is not bad. The staff is friendly. However, there is no english menu which makes things a bit difficult for us. And also this is the second time I come and ask for the burrata and they tell me they're out. They should add is as a special and take it off the menu. For that reason I would give them a 4. Other than that it's a nice place for a casual lunch/dinner!
