5	The crazy snow and ice we had this winter of 2014 left me with a sizable crack in my windshield. I started to call around quite a bit for quotes on replacing the windshield on my 2003 Saab 9-3 sedan. Everybody I called quoted me out at over $220 for a windshield replacement, which I felt was a bit high.  When I eventually found the number for Mike's, he quoted lower than the second lowest quote I got by at least $50. I was even more surprised and excited to hear that his shop was mobile and he would happily drive all the way to my job in Matthews for no extra charge. Not only that but he was able to give me an appointment the next day. He arrived on time and his service was great and he finished the job quickly. I highly recommend Mike's for any Charlotte area glass repair.
5	Great service  - arrived exactly as expected. Came on short notice on a Saturday to replace a broken window in my van. Cleaned up, courteous - absolutely a great job!
5	I had close to a 18 inch crack in my front windshield. Initially took it to Safelite and the quote to replace the entire windshield was pretty high. I shopped around Yelp and found Mike's, who quoted me roughly $100 less than Safelite so I gave him a try. I had no problems scheduling the appt, which I later had to reschedule. He was very accommodating to my schedule. There was no extra charge for him to come out to my condo and replace my windshield. It's been 3 weeks and I've found no issues with the work. Would highly recommend.
