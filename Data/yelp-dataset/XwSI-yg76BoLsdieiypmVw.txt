4	This place, although small, is so cute! The owners and/or employees are extremely nice and have a "my place is your place" sort of attitude. "Go make yourself at home in the fridge with the fresh cut flowers! Walk around!" They were so sweet. They had some really pretty arrangements scattered throughout the place, and a decent amount of other home accent pieces mixed in as well. If I were in need of centerpieces, an arrangement for a special occasion, or simply just a bouquet for a casual gift, this is the place I would go. **They deliver!**
1	this place depressed me.   there are a bunch of dusty, ugly old garden and decorative items sitting around, with high price tags, that look like dollar store rejects.  the whole time I was in there, the guy was on the phone taking orders for local benefits and stuff, so I guess some people like this place.  I saw a faux straw hat filled with artificial flowers if that gives you an idea of the treasures you can find here.  I went in the refrigerated section and saw mostly arrangements waiting for pickup, and just a small selection of flowers.  I had to buy a single stem for a teacher gift, so I selected a lily and paid $8 for it.  I said something to the guy about how it didn't seem like there were a lot of florists in the neighborhood and he gave me a listless "I guess".  The potted plants outside were also priced about three times what they should have been.  Still looking for a decent florist, although for now I will stick with the people at the farmers markets.
1	Recently placed an order for pick, was quoted a price over the phone and when I went to pick up the arrangement, they had raised the price.  Only because I challenged them did they make an adjustment, all while making me feel like it was my fault.  Although the arrangements and flowers are some of the best in Charlotte, get ready to fork out the cash and be careful you don't get the bait and switch treatment!
