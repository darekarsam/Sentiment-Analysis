5	Love this store. It is so nice to have a bead store opening in the West Valley. Please support a local business.
5	Tilas and rizos and superduos, Oh my!!! The selection in this store is amazing.  It's a beadweaver's dream.  All of the latest shapes and colors are represented at great prices.  Bead Unique also carries blank bracelet cuffs, bead backing, and suede for bead embroidery.  They even have size 15 beading needles AND Tulip needles!  I was greeted as soon as I walked in, asked if I needed any help, and then left to my own devices which I really appreciated.  There was a large work area in the center of the store for customers to use.  I believe they also offer classes.  There were a lot of beautiful kits available that included all the materials needed and instructions to complete the project.  While I am partial to bead weaving, there are tons of strung beads and Swarovski crystals for bead stringing. I saw a section devoted to Kumihimo as well.   Finished jewelry was available for purchase.  All in all, this is a great bead store.  It's located in a small shopping plaza.  There isn't a large sign above the storefront, but there is a big sign on the window.  Support your local businesses!!
5	This is a great bead store, it has the largest selection of czech mates I've ever seen!  They have a great selection of seed beads, super duos, and daggers too!  I will have to start digging through my patterns so I can use the great color selection of daggers they carry too. Great to have a bead store on the West side after so many have closed down....why buy at online stores when you can go into a local bead store and have fun coordinating your bead colors for your next piece.  It's also nice to get a second opinion on your color choices at this friendly store. Support your local bead store and stop buying online!
