4	Above average buffet.   They have some dishes yoo would come here for alone.  Spicy Calamari,  a mushroom dish, and their fish on the buffetline is usually pretty good.   Efficint staff clears dishes quickly.  All in all a good bargain if you like buffets.
4	Exceptional Value.  Staff sometimes *too* efficient, clearing away dishes before finished.A great mix of fish, meat and vegetarian offerings, which has been varying lately. Even their soup choices are fine.Highly recommended. The price difference between lunch (CDN $9.50) and supper ($14.50) seems a bit high, since there is little change. Still, it's a bargain for all-you-can-eat.
4	Great value: good selection, tasty, and well-prepared. All you can eat for under CDN $10.00.Family-friendly atmosphere; not noisy.Many Asian families visit, so that`s a good sign.Now has a BYOB policy,
4	Wonderful setting.
