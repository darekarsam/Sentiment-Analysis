4	The wings are kinda small and not the best, the fries are sometimes freshly made, sometimes run down and soggy.But it's the sauce that transforms this meal, they coat the wings in the sauce of your choice and then place them on said fries. MAGICTheir subs and burgers are well priced and you can really stuff your face for under $10.I've seen them in action on Super Bowl Sunday, they were running around with no sense of direction and the delivery driver was lost and kept calling back.What I don't understand is they moved from their location on Beaumont, but  decided to rebuild the same sad and pathetic decor and furniture they had from before.I've rarely seen people stay there and eat, so maybe if they renovated, people would actually eat in. Just take it to go, Summer is great since it's real close to Jarry Park
5	Best wings in town? Hell yeaaa. So saucy & juicy however the french fries are really not good .. sometimes when we order in I make my own fries at home! I think they need to kick it up a notch.
1	pire restaurent a jamais! Nous avons commander trois trios, le burger n'avait aucune sauce a linterieur pour un alldress il etait tres peux garnie, les frites tres froide et tout le reste aussi froid es presque aucune sauce ne venait avec et il en on charger un extra. Enolus le livreur nois demande plus de tip et nous lui en avons remis dejas 10$ de tips qui n'etait aucunement merite. Par la suite quand nous contacter le restaurent il n'on rien dautre a dire qu'ils ne peuvent rien faire oour nous!Merci A buffalo bills jean talon nous avoir fais non seulement perdre notre argent mais egalement notre temps! Conseil aller chez mcdonalds oour 5$ vous serais assez satifaits et le meme nombre de calories!
