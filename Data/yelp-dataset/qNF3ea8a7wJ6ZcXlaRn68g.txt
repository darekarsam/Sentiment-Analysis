5	I've been coming here for years to get my hair done by Kelly. She always does a great job and her prices are very reasonable!!!  The salon is always clean and has a positive atmosphere.
1	I went to stylist Brisa once. I had to bring my toddler because let's face it not all of us have nannies.  She did the cut and was great.  I tipped her $25 on a $35 haircut. I booked another appointment, told the person on the phone I had to bring the toddler. When I got there she refused to service me because I brought my child. I would NOT recommend this place. So uncool.
5	I've been coming to Innerlooks for years and love it! I absolutely love Christie and wouldn't go anywhere else! The price is right, the salon is always so nice and the stylists are all so friendly!
