4	A nice addition to the neighborhood! Pointe St-Charles is not the place where you would expect a good taqueria, but it is! It's owned and operated by a family that lived in San Francisco and got the idea from there.Food is very good and fresh. They have "aqua fresca" only from time to time since the locals don't buy it, so I am trying to mount a campaign, so if you go ask for it! ;-)I had a cheese quesadilla that came with a nice plate with salad, salsa, nacho chips, a nice meal for under $10 !
5	Best chicken tacos in Montreal   Friendly service. Fresh food carefully prepared.
5	Dios Mio! Attention San Diego burrito shop owners, Cafe Cantina has landed in and offers a familiar flavor so hard to find in Montreal ... Quesadillas are prepared with just the right amount of cheese and crisp to it. Guacamole is smooth and fresh. Seasoned Sweet Potato Tacos are devilishly yummy. Burritos come in one size - giiiaaaaant. All in all everything is made fresh to order so you won't be disappointed.My favorite lunch pick is the Spicy Burrito Carnitas with the perfect balance of rice, beans, meat, salad, tomatoes, guacamole and creamy sauce - delicious!Owners Serge and partner Marianne lived in California for a while, operated a Mexican restaurant in France and have now carved nice niche in the heart of those seeking for the best burrito in Montreal. Stop by to satisfy your craving for the real deal - it's only a few minutes from downtown!
4	Best burrido in Montreal even if it is ridiculously expensive. Take what you can get. I often come here on the weekends after a morning at Allez Up. Good espresso too!
