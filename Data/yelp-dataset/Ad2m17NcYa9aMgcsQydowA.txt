4	Lannie's Nail Shop is my favorite go to for pedicures. I'm not sure what their secret is, but my rhinestone encrusted french tipped toes always seem to look the prettiest and last the longest when I get them done here. It's a family owned shop, and it doesn't take long before they make you feel as though you're a part of it. I usually see Lindsey for my toes and Lannie for my brows. While I don't personally get my nails done, I've referred my mom and a few friends that do. Those that I have referred tend to become regulars if that gives you any idea of their satisfaction level. The price is right here and they always do a job well done, while making every effort to provide their customers with a relaxing and welcoming atmosphere. My only recommendation would be that you call ahead to make an appointment in order to avoid lengthy wait times. Otherwise, they're grrreat! You won't be disappointed.

Than does my nails and he is the BEST at what he does and, to make it an even better experience, he is a very honest, friendly, intelligent and fun guy to be around. His wife Lindsey does my pedicures and she is the GREATEST.  I had a problem with ingrown toenails until I found this sweetheart.  I always get compliments about my cute artwork that Lindsey crafts for me. I have nothing but high praise for this couple and this super friendly, hygienic and professional salon.
