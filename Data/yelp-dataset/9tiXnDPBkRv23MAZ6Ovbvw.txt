5	Excellent food!  Everything's low-country inspired.  The shrimp and grits are among the best I've ever had.  Seafood is fresh and comes with different sauce choices.  Good fried green tomatoes.  The place is small and has an "upscale Grateful Dead" inspired theme.  Yes, I said upscale Grateful Dead...hehe.  Tucked away near Encore Bistro in Blakeney.
2	I tried here because I was running out of restaurants to try during lunch hour, and it looked like a new development. It was a bit hard to find because the restaurant was tucked away in a corner and I drove around the surrounding strip malls a couple of times before I finally found it. I tried the fried green tomato appetizer and shrimp & grits for my lunch. Both of them were too greasy for me, so I lower my rating for this restaurant. When I asked for recommendations from the server, she just went ahead and pointed to the two most expensive entrees on the menu. Coincidence? I think not. Besides a young couple sitting at another table, I was the only one there. I don't think it'll be a very popular place to go in the future either...
