2	Its pretty cool to get ice cream at a drive thru, but you had better be ready with your order when you pull up or they treat you like an asshole. Yes, I know how it works, but when there are 60 ways to get any of their 30 items, sometimes I need a little time to sort out exactly what I want to give you money to serve me.
3	Just your run-of-the-mill fast food place.  Staffed by new people constantly, it's not the best place to walk up to the counter and ask for a recommendation.As far as Dairy Queens go, though, this one is just fine.  My orders have always turned out right, and the blizzards always well-mixed.  If you're looking for a quick, guilty treat, you can get it here.
5	Gotta love dairy queen  - glad this one has a drive through!
3	The burgers are pretty overpriced. My favorite thing here is the orange julius. At least buy that if you're going to visit Dairy Queen.
