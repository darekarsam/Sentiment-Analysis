5	This guy is the man.  If you go in on a weekday in the afternoon, you'll probably get him, and you'll probably know it.  He's been cutting hair in Montreal for almost 50 years, and it shows.  And I'm not referring to the 50's mechanical cash register that he rings you up with, or his smoker's growl.  I'm referring to the masterful cut he delivers.   He pays careful attention to the way your hair grows, and cuts accordingly.  I've never gotten a better cut in Montreal, Aveda included.  The icing on the cake: $15, tip included.Note:  It really is a Barber shop (complete with red/white swirled pole outside), and from they way he made it sound, he doesn't necessarily know how to cut womens' hair -- just a heads up!Update:  The other guy who works there isn't as good, but still worth the money i guess.
5	Excellent service and I'm happy with my haircut.Loved the place.
5	Highly recommended for students or someone who needs a good haircut fast at a very low price.Its close on sundays, so try weekdays and saturdays. The owner is very nice and has good skills.Enjoy your new haircut!
5	The shop is nice and the barber(nick) is a cool guy from Greece. He is a bit old fashion(he is around 80) but knows how to give a great cut. The price is also ok 12$ for a haircut. Nick told me that he works only on Monday and Tuesday so I can't comment about other people working in the shop. overall I will recommend it to anyone.
