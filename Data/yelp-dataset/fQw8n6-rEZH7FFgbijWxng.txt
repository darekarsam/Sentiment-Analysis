4	The Rundown: Only 1 guy works there from what I've seen.  He's funny, friendly and talented.  Also, you can't beat $10 for a great hair cut.DetailsThis is the only barber shop I go to now.  I've tried going to great clips, supercuts and other barbers around the area and I just can't find any place that can cut my hair better.  To top it off, the price of a simple haircut is only $10 dollars.  He also has a promotion that allows you to get your 10th haircut for free.  The only drawback that I can think of is his shop is kinda hard to find.  Just look for the Barber sign.
4	Gotten my haircut twice here and he consistently does a great job....and for $10, can't go wrong.Just don't ask him about politics.
5	Jose did a great job, was quick, it's cheap, and the conversation is great.  No complaints.  You will feel better by going here
5	Great little place to get a haircut.  Jose did a great job cutting my hair and I will be going back.  I will also be bringing my boys here to get their hair cuts as well.
