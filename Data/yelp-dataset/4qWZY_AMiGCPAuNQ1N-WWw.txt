5	Had some patches sewn on a Boy Scout Uniform. It was a little steep I thought, but Carmen gave me a deal because I had so many, and she got it done in 2 days so that I could wear it to summer camp. She also did an excellent job!
1	Been to carmen's a few times and she did a decent job on hemming pants.   The final time I went to get 2 pairs of pants hemmed is where it went downhill.   I did my normal routine went and got measured told her no rush on my pants.    When I got my pants back I took them home and tried them on and to my dismay these pants were hemmed way to short one pair being worse than the other.   I took them back and asked her if she could fix the alteration.   She then started on this constant that I had washed my pants and that is why they were shorter.   I told her I had washed them before I had brought them to her since being a shorter guy I have done this for years with other alterations and knew the routine.   At 1st I was honestly not even that upset about the wrong alterations but after she kept, basically, calling me a liar by insisting I had washed them I started to get upset.   She tried to let the pants out but she had cut off way too much and they were ruined.   And at no point even apologized but kept insisting I had washed them probably 10x during my short stay.    Needless to say I now have 2 pairs of pants that cost me $140 + alterations that are worthless.    I would not recommend with that level of customer service and attitude. I had honestly sent a lot of business her way since she was local but I have made sure to call those same people and tell them to go somewhere different.   Would not recommend her to anyone.
5	Carmen is good at what she does. I take all my alterations and whatever needs repair to her. I brought her some material and 3 flat pillows per request she made me a nice pillow. She is very reasonable, so go check her out.
