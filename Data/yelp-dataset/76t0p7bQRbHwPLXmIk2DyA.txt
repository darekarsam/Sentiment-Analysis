5	I had the Blackened Tilapia, it was lightly rubbed in Cajun spices, grilled and drizzled with garlic and thyme sauce. Served with fried red potatoes and seasonal vegetables, a cold draft.   And of course I had to have a Cheesecake shot for desert
4	Ok we are returning here slowly each time. We stopped coming here for awhile because the food was not up to par. I can say that this has changed! YES! I don't know if they have a new cook or management has stepped up but the food has never been better. Welcome back neighbor!
