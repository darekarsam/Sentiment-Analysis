2	Fast food not so bad... But still a fast food ;-)
4	Maybe it's nostalgia, but for some reason every time I have a Teen Burger I'm transported back to a time when hamburgers from a fast food restaurant was something to be excited about - a treat! Okay, I'm not that old, but my parents rarely let us eat junk food when I was growing up, and pretty much all the A & W's disappeared by the early 90's. Of those that did remain, several only served Chubby Chicken, which was always a major WTF moment once you read the menu. I digress, back to the review...to me a Teen Burger is the ultimate pick-me-up when you crave something terrible for you. The other burgers are good too, but this is my favorite. The sides are kind of boring, so I'd give them a miss. This location has always done me a solid on my Teen Burger, and I thank them.
4	Really tasty Teen Burger, or any burger, really.The place is not your average McDonald's, they prepare your food with care and pay lots of attention to details. The home sauce is evenly spread across the whole burger and added just the right amount, unlike some other fast food restaurants where you get one side of the burger overloaded with mustard and the other side with nothing.A&W's decor is always so cozy and homey, the place is clean and really well designed. Bar stools are pretty comfortable, and the restaurant is well lit.The self-service is also available in this place, you can customize your burgers in anyway you'd like using a touchscreen.

Compared to the Burger Kings and McDonalds I frequent when I have no other choice in food, A&W provides fresh fast food with friendly service, which is now almost impossible to get nowadays. A great addition on the oh-so-busy St. Catherine street!
