3	THIS PLACE HAS CLOSED.  The fries were delicious but the wings were awful.
4	Wingstop is returning to the Champaign-Urbana area.  The new restaurant is under construction right next to the new Hollywood Liquor store and the new Jet's Pizza.  The fries at Wingstop are the very best I have ever had.  Welcome back Wingstop, we missed you.
