5	The staff in the mini mart is always friendly.  Lowest cigarette prices in the area.  Ask about the discount basket.  The gas bays are always clean and functioning.  Nice flower pots at the pumps.  Restrooms are well maintained.  Don't forget the drive thru car wash complete with hand drying by Jorge.  He is awesome.  Never leaves a streak or drop of water on your car.  He even wipes down your tires!  Best $5 car wash in town.
4	This is a good, clean Chevron with slightly more spacious stalls for filling up your car.  Nice location on SE corner of Bell & 75th ave.
1	Went to the bathroom while the gas was pumping and the store smelled like the damn bathroom, as soon as i walked into the store i knew i was in for something nasty.clean your shit !!!!
