3	ate here tonight because i'm staying at the Marriott Madison West, and this is the restaurant within the hotel.great chilled shrimp app, with horseradish-like remoulade, and cocktail sauce. there were only four, although big, but definitely not enough for a few people.also had their app of sausage flatbread - YUM!!great local beers here and they change it looks like a lot. had a wonderful spotted cow! will try some other things before my departure probably, so i'll report back. full bar also.
2	***This restaurant and its breakfast buffet do not feel fresh (kind of like this Marriott, which has a very outdated decor); the breakfast buffet featured a good variety of items--bacon, sausage, breakfast, potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, cereal, pastries, oatmeal, and an omelet bar; the food was not horrible, but a lot of it was salty; the poor lighting in the lobby (this is an open lobby restaurant) probably made the food feel worse than it actually was; service was pleasant***This Marriott has its own free self parking lot.
4	The breakfast buffet was $14 and I checked it out. I did not think the selections warranted my money.However, I had to eat there for lunch. I was at an event where I could not leave. Day one: Cheeseburger with a side salad. WOW! For $12 you sure get your money's worth. The burger was huge, I could not finish it. The salad was a FULL side salad that needed its own plate. Everything was cooked well and the flavors were spot on. The service was fantastic. Day 2 lunch: Tomato soup with grilled cheese. This is one of their menu pairing. My only complaint?  I could have used a little more sandwich. The portion was a touch small for $10. However, the flavors were amazing. I just wanted to inhale the whole meal.
