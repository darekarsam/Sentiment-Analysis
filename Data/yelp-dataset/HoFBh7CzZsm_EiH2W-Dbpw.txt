2	There is some cool stuff in here, that's for sure. It's laid out with mostly furniture in the front and mostly clothes, toys, and other small housewares in the back, including old records, electronics, etc. Most of their furniture seems to be in great quality.Why only 2 stars? First, the reliability - I have come by this place many times on my way through this block of 8th Ave only to find them to be closed in the middle of most weekdays. I've mentioned it to others, they all thought it had closed. I imagine I know how Peter felt on Easter morning when Jesus's tomb was open, having come across this store during a time it was open.Second - The staff. We walked in, stayed for about 40 minutes, discussed many of the pieces, and even spoke about buying a few(large) pieces and not once did the woman who (owns?) worked behind the desk look up from restoring a small toy. It's one thing if you don't care to be particularly friendly(Maybe even a good thing - I walked into Mostly Mod after and couldn't get out of there in less than 30 minutes because we kept chatting), but to totally ignore potential customers is unacceptable.So I left empty handed on principal, although there were a few smaller pieces I could have been coerced into buying. Would I stop in again? If I had the option to, yes. Maybe it was a bad day, and the stuff is definitely worth looking at.
5	I LOVE this place! It is a bummer that they aren't open more hours, but I will take what I can get. And it just means there is more for ME! They have a ton of awesome stuff from cool retro furniture to funky lunch boxes from my youth. Even if you don't buy anything, (which is unlikely as they are so well priced and have an amazing selection!) it is worth the trip to just check out all the goodies and get nostalgic.
4	Beautiful products and furniture.I purchased my wall sail boat here. While it does have a lot of cool tchotchke to look at, I would like it more if it had more items I wanted to purchase.
