5	I love Dr Brian!  He uses the activator and the technique that goes with it. It's a bit different, it's gentle and doesn't cause sweats or dizziness like most manual adjustments have for me.  It specifically adjusts what needs to be adjusted, not everything!  He also spends a lot of time if you need it, he's a really great guy!  I've been driving half an hour to get here because of Dr Brian.
5	Recently visited this office location. I have been to plenty of joint offices in the valley but this one was special. Dr. Brian was very nice and welcoming and I will definitely be coming back to have my adjustments done with him.
5	Great place. Very relaxing. The receptionist was sweet and the chiropractor gentle and effective. I will be going back.
5	Dr. Brian is great! I've had a terribly pinched nerve in my right shoulder, and I have been coming to him for the past three weeks. It has been a process because of how tight my muscles have been, but he is getting me back into shape. I really appreciate that he cares about and listens to what I'm feeling and then works to rectify it. I will continue to use his services even once this issue has passed. He has earned my trust.
5	Dr. Brian is the best!!! I knew he would be the chiropractor for me when his first question was what do you not like in an adjustment. I am not a drop table adjustment girl. I need a side posture adjustment. He listened with care and concern and gets it right every time! I drive past 2 other Joints to see Dr. Brian in Glendale. I am hooked! You have to give him a try!
5	Love Dr. Brian!!! He's so gentle, yet effective, in his adjustments. Really nice facility. Everyone is always welcoming. Can't say enough!  :)
