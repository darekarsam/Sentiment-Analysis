5	I was referred to this office and after consulting with three different offices I am beyond happy that I chose to go with Dr. Saxe's office. Dr. Saxe's team (specifically Tess), made my day! Everything that could go wrong today went wrong which made my daughter miss her very 1st appointment. After speaking with Tess she turned my day around with her wonderful customer service assuring me that as a client I'm valuable. I went as far as starting a Yelp account just so I can give kudos :)
5	This is hands down the best orthodontist in town! The staff is great and always friendly! My daughter loves coming here!
5	Been coming here for a year now for my daughter, and no complaints. The staff have been nothing but friendly, and very helpful. This office is equipped if you have other children for the wait, movies always playing, and video games. Love the colors in the office, boosts the energy!!!
5	This ortho place is wonderful! I have been coming here for more than a year for ortho treatment, Dr. Saxe and her staff are the best. The office is a fun and welcome place to be with movies and video games. I recommend anybody to come here for braces.
