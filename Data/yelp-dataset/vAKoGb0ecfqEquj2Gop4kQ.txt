5	This place is stunning.  So many things to see and chairs not to sit in.  Parts of it seemed more like a museum than a store you could actually buy things from.  That sounds like it isn't a good thing, but it speaks to the quality of the products they have.From the flawless egg chairs to classic LPs in frames to the lamps to the hand held Merlin game which brought me right back to my childhood to the works in progress -- everything was perfect. I could have spent an hour in there coveting the things I couldn't afford and lamenting the fact that I only brought a carry on with me on my trip.  Next time, I'll need to bring a crate to ship things back in.If you are in the area you owe it to yourself to stop in and take a look.Oh, and while you are there don't forget to stop into Retro Ranch right down the road for some more vintage goodness.
5	If you have an interest in high-quality midcentury modern design you should make this one of your first stops in Phoenix.  I knew we had hit a winner when we walked in the front door and saw a Warren Platner arm chair snuggled in with Bertoia chairs and other iconic designer pieces.  The owners can even meticulously restore your own modern furniture with original Knoll fabric.  Plus, there's a music room with an egg chair and excellent vinyl selections to listen to while you shop.  It's a family-owned business and the owners are knowledgeable and friendly.
