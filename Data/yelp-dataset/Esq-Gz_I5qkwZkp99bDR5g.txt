1	After having three applications done in three months and being assured by the owner that my eyebrows would heal evenly and the hairstrokes that I asked for would show through after a few weeks, I am left with uneven, grayish-brown eyebrows. I do not write reviews to hurt businesses, but I wish I could have read a review like this, before having a permanent procedure performed on my face here. I contacted the owner and she did not try to make amends in any way. I am extremely dissatisfied with my experience here.
5	I had my eyeliner permanently tattoo'd by Marcia.  I have seen so much of her work, working in the industry myself, and have heard nothing but compliments.  I have severe allergies, i snowboard, cycle, and am involved in tons of outdoor activities where my eyeliner runs and burns.  Getting it tattoo'd on completely eradicated all of these issues.  It's the perfect application as far as looking natural and making my eyes pop.  Marcia is a very caring, and easy to talk to professional, and has been in the industry over 15 years.  I like to give credit, where it's due.  Come look at her portfolio, schedule a consultation, and you will know exactly what to expect.  I'll post a picture of my eyeliner so you can see the beautiful job she did.
5	I cannot tell you how impressed I am with the beautiful and impressive work that she does.After having brows and  eyeliner done. ( and after an eye surgery) I could not be more pleased!! I have also had her do lash extensions On several occasions.She will work with you to find exactly what it is you're looking for and unlike so many that are recently licensed she is experienced!!  I would recommend Marcia and her business highly!!
