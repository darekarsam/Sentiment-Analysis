4	Clean, nice staff.  Taste was average.Prices are reasonable.
2	Fairly expensive for the food they provide. Service is so so. Only got drinks when asked. Sashimi is sliced too thick, feels like you are eating raw fish fillet than sashimi.
4	This is a tiny little place that is easily missed behind the behemoth Turtle Jacks and Fionn McCools.  I was in there at about 8 PM on a Tuesday and I was the only customer, which is a bit scary.  It was whisper quiet and the husband and wife proprietors are really the only thing I could hear.I ordered an Asahi, a seaweed salad, and some sushi (just fish and rice, no rolls).  I told the waitress "no eel" since I don't like it (I like to make things clear when ordering a chef's choice sushi plate...) and she was surprised, but complied.  There was a nice selection of fish and it was all quite fresh, though one of the fishes was a little *too* cold and semi-frozen inside.  It happens, not the end of the world.  Presentation was very nice and the rice was perfect, despite the lack of customers.  The seaweed salad was great, and a perfect portion.I was relieved to see somebody come in and order take out, as it can't be possible to keep a restaurant open with so few customers.  I'll go back as the food was quite good and the owners seem like a very nice couple.  Pricing is reasonable.
