5	Gail is wonderful.  I relocated from PA to AZ 2 yrs ago and she saved me.  African Americans looking for a salon this is the place.  Professional and clean.  Gail is about making your hair healthy and stylish, period.
1	I never even made it into this salon--I wanted to try it--I really did.  I called to let the stylist know that I had found them online and wanted to get pricing on a shampoo, cut, and style.  While I did get the pricing, the woman acted like being on the phone with a potential new client was the LAST thing she wanted to do.I asked her if she does Saturday appointments, she responded "Yes we do,"...silence...silence...silence...silence--you get the point. I'm thinking O-k, guess you're not going to ask if I want to make an appointment. I thanked her and ended the call.I have always had a good rapport with my stylist, and it started with the first call.  First impressions are lasting and the impression she gave me was that I needed to try another salon!
5	Great service! Gail is efficient and skilled with relaxed hair.  I have a sensitive scalp and Gail tended to it with expert care- I did not burn!  I walked out with professionally sleek and healthy-looking hair!  I've been relaxing my hair for a very long time, and Gail is definitely one of the more skilled hair specialists I've had the pleasure of working with. :-)
5	Gail is awesome. She's friendly and fast.
