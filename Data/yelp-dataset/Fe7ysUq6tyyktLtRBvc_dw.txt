5	So recently my car was hit and I took it to bell collision. Seriously the best body shop in phoenix just saying. I talked with David Demarko.. not sure if I spelled that right but he's a good guy. I trusted this shop because they had worked on my old car a few years ago and it came out looking perfect. Yet again, great job guys. They fixed my door. A week later I got hit AGAIN and took it right back to David at Bell collision center.. For real, your stupid if you need body work and don't go here.
5	I am so pleased with the Bell Collision center. My vehicle received some very unwanted damage in a parking lot, I was devastated. I have purchase both of my Honda's from Bell Honda and so all of my service there so I gave the Bell Collision center a call.  I worked with Tullio and he quickly set me at ease. My truck was back to new in no time. He was very good about keeping me up to date and was very respectful of my time. All of their staff was so friendly and helpful. I would refer them to anyone!
5	These guys are super professional and work with all the insurance companies.  The manager, Chris is the best and I always recommend my customers to him and his crew!
4	I am very pleased with the services and staff of Bell Collision. They are fair and trustworthy of taking care of my car.  Grant helped take it an extra notch and replaced a stop light bulb. I would recommend anyone to the center.
