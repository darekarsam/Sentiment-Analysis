4	Believe It or Not, there's a good bistro at the top of Les Beaux Jeudis (aka "Thursdays"). I tend to go to Montreal over 3-day weekends in the winter for ski season, so many places aren't open (read: Holidays).  BUT, Les Beaux Jeudis to the rescue!  They were open for dinner on Christmas Eve 2008. The food was good too!  A solid 4.
5	i came here for sunday brunch recently.. before you even start.. you get a glass or orange juice, a big bowl of fruit as well as a bunch of fresh bread, crossaints and other breakfast pastries.. i ordered a 3 egg omlette which was cooked perfectly and it also came with a side of crispy fried potatoes.. i don't know how this place does for dinner.. but for sunday brunch.. this is one hell of a deal for all the delicious food you get..
