1	Its a McDonalds...
4	K, I had to search for this specific McDonalds. Like I said before, it is what it is. I rate things for what they are beyond what they are... does that make any sense??Anyways, the people here are super friendly. There is a weird trend with fast food in this area- the workers are all oddly friendly. This place is the same way. I really can't justify a 5 star rating for a McDonalds, but I will give it 4 stars considering it's a great place to drive through for a dollar drink from time to time.
5	I never expect much from  drive thru - its McDonalds right.  Well the cashier was perky, friendly and professional - okay?The second window was just as friendly and professional and attentive.WOW - I was super stunned - nice job who manages that store
3	Staff are friendly, but their internet is sloooooow. I've been here 20 minutes and my iPad is only half done in downloading today's newspaper (not the big Sunday paper, it's Thursday).Follow up: download of the paper took 32 minutes, but now I gotta leave.
1	Slowest service ever, sitting in drive through for ten minutes now :( Not very good, drink was watery...
4	Stopped for breakfast yesterday morning and they were supper fast and everything was fresh and just as I order. Did I mention that the staff is supper friendly? I live close to the McDonalds on Bethany Home, they are terrible. I'll drive out of the way for always fresh French fries from now on.
2	Been coming here for years. Seems like the past two have seen this location in decline. Slowest drive thru of any McD's I've been to. Consistently slow service, inside as well. McDonald's usually has the best Coca-Cola, save this location. The mix is way off. Too much syrup.You can do better.
1	Did I mention the slowest drive-thru? Yeah. This particular franchise appears to have really poor management. Also seems to be understaffed.

It will take you an extra 3 minutes to get there but the staff, service, and location are all much nicer. This location just opened up in early 2014. Very modern for a McDonalds.
3	Would have been 5 stars if the the cashier didn't have such a cranky attitude. Understandable though, she was very busy! Drive thru was super longh! Walked in and got food quickly! Nothing better then mcdonalds breakfast!
