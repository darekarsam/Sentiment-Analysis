5	I just had two paintings framed for Christmas gifts and couldn't be happier with the results. I called and Amber was able to schedule an appointment right away.  We met in their office and she showed me a wide range of frames and materials that worked within my budget.  Amber took the time to make some great suggestions that really made each painting look amazing and brought out the colors in a way I definitely couldn't have done on my own. The whole process was easy, fast and surprisingly affordable especially given the quality.  Highly recommend if you need to frame a picture or painting!
