4	We really liked this place. Visited in November 2012. It was inexpensive and very spacious. We really liked the fixtures, accents, and the "dimmer" for the fan. It was a nice touch. Our room had a kitchenette with a stove and fridge. It also had a living room area. Separate from the bedroom. The bathroom was also spacious. It was a beautifully appointed room and it was very clean. This was a pleasant surprise becaues we were not expecting much from this place. Totally wowed us! Highly recommended.
2	Room not as described.  The suites are NOT suites; they are a room with a kitchenette.  Had to upgrade to a bedroom suite to get room with sofa bed.  This used to a candle wood and converted.  Front desk clerk scott did his best to satisfy us but we were not happy with the way it went.  Hotel seems clean but there is an odd smell in the hallway.  Parking lot pretty limited too.  Will skip this one next time.  Oh and they don't know what handicapped access room means.
1	Worst customer service I've ever encountered in the hospitality industry. Definitely did not feel safe or clean either
