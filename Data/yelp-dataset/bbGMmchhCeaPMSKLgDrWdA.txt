5	Good food. Very friendly owner.
1	My elementary school teacher colleagues and I were eagerly awaiting our end of the year luncheon at Il Cenone.  When we arrived, the restaurant was un-airconditioned (on a hot summer day), and the waiters were sweating.  We were given a hard time when we requested a few extra seats. It felt like the waiters were doing us a favour by serving us. We ordered our food and had to wait an extremely long time. When the food arrived, it was mediocre at best.  The risotto was bland, and the rest of the food was under-seasoned, and not well portioned.   Water and drinks were slow to arrive.  When the first diner requested her bill, she was rudely told 'this is the last time you'll get individual bills!'.  Puzzled, I expressed  my shock at the waiter's rudeness.  The waiter retorted that he was not rude madame... (thus proving his rudeness).Bills were very slow to arrive. It turned out that the rude waiter was in fact the manager (perhaps the owner)  of the restaurant!The mood in the hot and clammy restaurant was unfortunately very misogynistic.  We were a group of 40 female professionals, along with a couple of male colleagues.  Had we been a group of 40 male professionals, this sort of treatment would surely not have occurred.   When I left, the rude server thanked me and told me to have a nice day.  When I told him there was no need to thank me as I did not enjoy my meal and I would not be returning, he followed me on to the street and continued to justify his rude behaviour.  Very unbecoming...an atrociously failed attempt at proper customer service.Overall, I am not only disappointed, but disgusted by the the experience my colleagues and I had at this restaurant.  40 women could have recommenced this restaurant to friends and family, but instead we will tell them to STAY AWAY!
