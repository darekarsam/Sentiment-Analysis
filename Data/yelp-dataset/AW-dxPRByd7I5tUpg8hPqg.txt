1	I bought four woven shades at Home Depot on October 23, 2013 that Springs Window Fashions manufactured. After installation it is obvious that they do not line up horizontally. I have contacted customer service four times and "Pedro" has still not responded. Today is January 7, 2014.
4	I purchased 4 large window shades including multiple shades on one headrail for a large patio door. They are beautiful fabric and were installed easliy. I had one that was faulty and after contacting Costco.com through which they were purchased, a new shade was sent within a few days. The customer service rep was professional and friendly. Many people have said they are some of the nicest shades they have seen. The fabric is stunning.
1	There are hardly words to describe how poorly made their products are, but they've managed to dig a little bit deeper with their customer service. We purchased a home that had what we thought were Hunter-Douglas window coverings, but turned out to be Springs. The plastic clips had cracked and broken in direct sun (funny, but you put window coverings up to keep out the sun). Our licensed installer called them to get replacements, they sent the wrong thing. Then it turned out the battery packs weren't working. They wouldn't send them, telling him I (the customer) had to call. When I finally got through (no mean feat) they told me they don't sell directly to customers. ? After expressing my extreme displeasure he agreed to send me the battery packs. He told me 5 days. They didn't run the credit card until  a week later, Then it turns out a motor is bad. As the blinds are "just" 5 years old, they don't warranty them. My guy talked to them two weeks ago and we were told a "motor resetting tool" (really?) would be here by Tuesday. It's been two weeks. No reset tool.  I know the original owners went for Springs to save a few dollars, but this is where the cheap turns out expensive. And time consuming. AVOID. AT. ALL. COSTS. (costs being a key word here)
