3	Have been on a spiritual kick recently. The larger store in the McCarran Shopping Center holds more product and is less expensive. The workers here are nice and will call out to the other stores if you are looking for something in particular.
5	Absolutely amazing customer service and very nice store. You rock Travis! Very good vibes. We will be back. Just wanted to check it out but we ended up buying some stuff just because Travis was so friendly. Had a great conversation about spirituality and religions with him.
1	My friend and I went to see Theresa I usually see Alice but we took a chance on someone else I told her one intimate detail and not only did she keep repeating it over and over but she cursed and used the sh*t word a few times which I think is inappropriate she said she sees me having a lot of fun and talked about her own problems comparing them to.mine example she was depressed and anxiety and she found the right medicine and had sinus headaches and OCD I mean honestly I thought the reading about me not her.she told me It doesn't seem I want children but that's not true and said children can happen if I.really want it. my friend also was told she saw her having lots of fun as well and meeting three guys but that was before she told her she was pregnant then the story changed,,with my friend she wasn't paying much attention to the cards and almost giving her personal opinion she doesn't read cards well at al I called to see if we could come back and see Alice but they said the people are individually contracted so pretty much 60$ down the drain: (
