5	Went with a groupon. They did a great job. Didn't charge me extra for dog hair, as the small print said they might. Car looks like new! Much better job than other detailing I've had done, and my car was in dire need of cleaning. Planning to go back the next time. It is a bit out of the way in Homewood, but don't be deterred.
1	Bought a Groupon, never could contact the company.  I left a message and never received a response.  Groupon and I have both tried contacting the company and have both failed.  I ended up getting a refund.  For all I know it could be a great detail shop, but that's if you're lucky enough to get a response from them.
1	I second Crista S's review above. I bought the Groupon for this place, although it doesn't look like they even exist anymore. Their number is disconnected, and I could not reach them by email. I've pinged Groupon to take the coupon off the site, and this place should be removed from Yelp as well.
