4	Went there on a Wednesday, early evening. It's a small place, but very comfortable and clean. Overall atmosphere was very cozy, and I found the wall decoration with the red bowls that they use in the place very interesting. I really liked the quality of the food, and the price was reasonable. The best thing about the place was definitely the service. The main server and cashier (who also seemed to be the manager), was very thoughtful and polite, making us feel like we were home. At the end, when we asked to take home the leftovers, he added a lot of cheese. I will certainly go back and the place is definitely worth a try if you're in the corner!
