1	Worst Pharmacy Experience in 30 years!  Paul, the pharmacist hates his job and was very unprofessional.  At one point he had a customer banging on the drive thru window because of their frustration.  I will never set foot in this Walgreens again.  Horrible experience.
5	great store. always clean, so are the bathrooms. employees can be rude but thats on a rare occasion. always go here for little last minute errans. close by my house so thats also awesome.
1	Terrible prices at this Pharmacy. They quoted me a price 5x higher than I pay at a large, national, well-known superstore chain.  And this on a drug that is generic and old as the hills.  AWFUL!
1	I gave one star because there isn't a lower option. I went in to see someone at the clinic. I just came to town for vacation and my ears were hurting from the flight. The sign says they are open till 7:00. I got there just before 6:30 and was told they were closed. I pointed out the sign says 7 and the rude woman says they close early for cleaning. Again, not the hours advertised. I told her my problem and she said that checking my ears could be a really long procedure and again they were closed. She offered to send me 40 minutes away to another Walgreens (how kind-insert sarcasm here) rather than the CVS only a half mile away. By the way, CVS was awesome. In and out in 15 minutes with my prescription in hand. Go to CVS!!! Stay away from this Walgreens!!!
