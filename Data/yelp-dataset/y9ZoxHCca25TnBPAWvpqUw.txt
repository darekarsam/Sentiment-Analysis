1	Boke! We attempted to order the "spicy penne"- they were out of penne pasta so my husband had carbonara instead. He had to bin it. Unlike the reviewer before me, his wasn't in a puddle of grease; it was as dry as a stick. In fact, when we tried to tip it in to the bin, a stick would've come in handy to poke it out the container. We also ordered a bottle of diet Irn Bru (mmm, healthy) but got a bottle of full fat instead. Never again, we'll stick to Al Borgo in Juniper Green instead.
