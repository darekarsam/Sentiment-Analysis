3	Just attended the Taco bash. Got there two hours after opening and it was already crowded. Most tents had hardly any room in them to just hang out, but you could find your niche if you tried hard enough. There were lines for most things, but it wasn't a long wait for anything and that included ID check, tickets and getting a beer. Some taco places did have rather long lines, but you could also find many that did not have those lines. They had wrestling and some lame bands, but the crowd was mellow and friendly as we met some new friends in the drinking/tent zones. As for tacos, I had one bad one from manuel's and two good chicken ones from familiar places in the valley, like Salty Senorita. Half-priced admission tickets helped the cause as all drinks were 6 bucks each, but true to their word, all tacos were 2 bucks. People were still streaming in at 4pm, so crowds are the only real issue, but today it wasn't scorching hot and you could find room to be away from crowds too if you wanted. Pretty good festival.
4	i was impressed for my first visit to the taco festival. we've had less than good experiences with local festivals recently, due in part to online coupons, so we were kind of dreading the parking, the lines, the crowds, the mis-communication, etc. Actually...none of that happened. since we are early birds, we arrived about noon and were whisked right through the line of cars...it moved quickly and efficiently. then a quick walk through admissions, with no wait to buy tokens or ID check and we were eating tacos within 5 minutes of parking!everything is token so i suggest to walk to the token tent opposite the entrance...far fewer people in line. then just make your way through all the tasty tacos. the longest we had to wait was for Habaneros....because they were so good we ate there twice. what's really nice is that all the tents have what kind of tacos they are serving labeled on the outside of their tent. it kept us from waiting in lines with only pork or beef tacos. there were only 2 veggie taco options available, but a handful of seafood and fish options as well. meat eaters will have every tent to pick from. of note...Rubios has the biggest portions!the big guys are there, El Hefe, Salty's, Dos...with their tents and plenty of drinks. we watched some Mexican wrestling (lucho libre (sp?)) and were lucky enough to get into the tequila tent with some friends as DD. i didn't sample any of the tequila's but our friends seemed to be enjoying themselves immensly!it was hot in the sun so sunscreen is highly recommended. there are shade spots to take a break and plenty of bathrooms. exiting was just as efficient as entering. bring cash unless you like paying 4.50 service fees for the ATm's they have on site.
4	I had a Great time at the AZ Taco Festival. I mean like Tony the f*cking Tiger Grrrrreat. I may have just been so impressed because the most recent festival I attended was such a dud that it made this one look exponentially better.We got here early which I think also helped. The parking was smooth and Free. There were no crowds to fight. It was awesome. The token system used to purchase food and drinks also made everything run smoother than if people were trying to pay by other means at each individual taco booth. Very efficient.My favorite taco was made by the Tonto Bar & Grill. It was a grass fed bison taco with chile jicama slaw and tepary salsa. Very good.Monti's Steakhouse made a good beef taco, but what I liked most was their corn tusk taco basket. That was pretty cool. There was also a unique dessert taco made by Gertrudes. Unfortunately I didn't take a pic... The taco shell was a chocolate (I think) waffle cone. Inside was avocado ice cream and something else... ugh I wish I took a pic. Memory Fail. It was definitely tops for uniqueness though.I'm right there with Travis B in noticing the lack of veggie taco options. There should have been a few more. They're not necessarily my thing, but if I was a vegetarian, I would have been disappointed. We didn't hang around for much of the entertainment. It was mostly just a taco devouring expedition. And in that respect the AZ Taco Fest was a complete success.
3	Best taco I had was the shrimp taco from Monti's. Now I'm think I should have went back and tried their beef or steak taco. The event was cool. Parking wasn't terrible, people were nice and tacos were $2. Entertainment was kinda lame. There were bean bag toss and a wrestling ring. Other than that, you can go buy drinks for $6.Other notable tacos I ate were the duck tacos, and the avocado ice cream taco... Which was more of a dessert than really tacos. I wish it tasted more like avocado.If you are into eating tacos, then this is the event for you! Are $2 tacos cheap? Because I didn't think so. haha. Maybe it's because I'm a 99 cent taco kind of guy. Think of it this way... you pay $12 to get in, and then it's $2 tacos. By the time you hit $20, you ate four sample size tacos. Those are $5 sample size tacos you just ate!But if you love tacos, eat up! :)
5	We had a wonderful time at the taco festival. We got there around 3 and it we were swept right in. No lines and parking was easy. The organizers of the festival were very organized because getting in was so quick. My favorite tacos were the sausage tacos from the French Cowboy. I need to find that shop because I can't get them off of my mind. My only complaint is I wish there were more vendors that had drinks and tacos. I would like to not have to walk around looking for drinks. But overall and excellent and super fun Saturday.
4	This was my 2nd year coming to the AZ Taco Festival @ Salt River Field....and it was awesome!

Parking was easy and FREE!  I can't wait to come back next year!Return Factor - 100%
4	I thought this year was better than the Fest last year.  It was more organized. We went as soon as it opened at 11a on Sunday.  We found parking immediately and we had prepaid discount tickets $6 a piece. Once you are inside you can purchase "tokens" for $2 per piece. Almost all tacos were a token so $2 a taco. There were a few tacos that required 3 tokens and those were specialty ones like the crab avocado at The Monk.  Margaritas and beer were $6.  We ended up spending a total of $38.  We especially liked the tacos from Distrito, Pirate Taco, and the ahi tuna tacos at Ling and Louie's.  I like the taco festival because it's something fun to do outside in the sunshine with live music and great people watching.  I did notice a lot of families, including ourselves.  I would rate it as a good event to bring you kids to and have a good time while sampling the best tacos.
3	This was a fun event, but not a great value. My husband and I were gifted free tickets to this event, and attended on Sunday, parking was easy and free. The lines were not too long to get ID'ed and to purchase tokens. Tokens cost $2 per token and it was 2 tokens for 1 taco and 3 tokens for alcohol (margarita/wine/beer). Some tacos were better than others. My favorite was the goat taco from Gertrudes and the carne asada taco from the Four Seasons. The tacos varied in size, from a mid-sized tortilla to a mini tortilla, as well as various fillings where some places were more generous than others. It seems that the stand that had the largest tacos won the contest, we didn't try those though. Los Primos Carniceria were serving authentic street tacos which were fantastic, but they handed us flyers advertising for their business which offers $1 tacos, we were paying $2 for the tacos there, so we felt a little ripped off. All together we spent $40 for 3 margaritas, 1 beer, and 8 small tacos, plus if we were to purchase two tickets at $24, it totals out to be $64, not worth the price in my opinion. On a positive note, this one of the few opportunities to try so many different types of tacos in one place, and we discovered some new restaurants.
5	It was really fun and had great tacos! Every taco I ate became my favorite one and I couldn't really choose from all of them. The couple that did stand out were a pork belly taco and this other pork taco where the restaurant was giving generous amounts of guac and salsa on the side. It was a great event that I would go to again if I am in town :)
5	Taco Festival: I salute you! Wow, this was my first time at a Taco Festival, I'm not sure if this thing happen all the time in the South West but it sure as $#!& doesn't happen in Canada! I had a blast. There we're so many amazing AZ  restaurants out representing as well as food trucks and super cool other places like Snoh. There were VIP tequila and beer tents, fabulous weather, well organized parking and super great event staff. A major shout out to Mission/House, the most amazing, creative tacos ever! We went back for seconds - and the infused whiskey tea that Chef Louis created. I also have to give it to El Heffe, they most definitely know how to create a party! For photo ops, the full sized wrestling ring with Mexican luchador, ya, that was unreal! The whole day was full of fun, tacos, tequila and new friends. As soon as tickets go on sale for next year Arizona, buy them! And get the VIP ones, arriving and not having to pay for everything because it's all included in your VIP price is the best!
4	Excellent tacos, decent price.  Fun way to kill a few hours and eat some amazing variations upon the classic taco.
1	Was so excited bought my tickets two months early what a disappointment.. First you better buy your tickets in advance our you will wait an hour to get in.  That wait will be the highlight of your day.  The only bar areas are run by the festival and you are stuck drinking cheap domestic or cheap tap house Margaritas at $6. A piece.  If you want a shot of tequila at a taco festival (I know weird concept) you have to go to a separate tent Stand in another 1 hour line and pay $20 for 10 tastings!  To bad if you only want 1 or 2 you will drink 10 and like it.. Of course like every festival no credit cards you have to buy tokens which only worsens the pain.. I thought is be able to sample the full experience for each vendor at every tent. (food, drink, shots) Needless to say never ever again..
4	I love a good taco and The Arizona Taco Festival is just the place to try tacos from several different restaurants. Gadzooks and Taco Guild were my favorites. The only complaint is maybe moving it later in the month as it is still very warm this time of year. Make sure you buy your tickets in advance so not to have to wait in the huge line and also to receive a discount.
4	I liked this festival but then again I did a lot of things right to insure that we would like the festival. 1. I pre-bought our tickets to avoid the hour+ lineup for tickets.2. We brought water to drink for the long walk from our car to the entrance. Unfortunately the parking attendants made us park in a spot that was closer to Target on Indian Bend then to the gate. The parking was free so that certainly was a plus and the security let us carry in our water.3. We arrived between 12-1. As it was, Gallo Blanco had already run out of their chicken tacos in the early afternoon.4. I printed out last years list of winners so we had a target of several booths that we wanted to go try. There are so many booths yet only so much stomach capacity! My favorites this year, Mission, Gallo Blanco & Gadzooks, had been winners from 2013.5. We brought enough money to buy enough tokens so we could get everything that we wanted. Tacos =$2=1 token and Beer/Margharitas =$6=3 token. The luchador "show" was so sleazy and campy that I had to love it but what wasn't so fabulous was their use of profanity. I swear like a longshoreman but never in front of children. Some rocket scientist on the "American" wrestling team was calling members of the audience motherf#%*ers. Yup, in front of a bunch of kids. I was a little disappointed to not see very many fish/seafood offerings. And I was pleasantly surprised to see as much seating in the shade as I did. Overall a really fun and delicious event.
5	Be there early cause the lines will get very long.. im talkin hundreds of people .. We were smart and got there 20 min before they opened at 10:40 . We got in right away and tryed 4 tacos stands before 11:10 :) haha All the tacos were delish that we had and everything was running really smooth .. Cons : 1) God made it 93 degrees with no clouds the one day the taco festival happened which weeks before it was beautiful outside.2) The drinks were way over priced . 6$ domestics and run down margaritas but o well what do you expect . ( Side note , there's a review on here that says " and they were serving tequila with tacos , I know weird concept right " ????? Tequila and tacos are Mexican why wouldn't they be served together WHO IS THIS GUY ?!!! LOL )
4	This is for the 2014 event!Sunday funday, thanks to Yelp and a half off coupon! again, we arrived at opening time, 11am. Good thing we did...when we left at 2pm, the entry line was super long and lines for the tacos were ridiculous. headed straight for the tokens tent. out of what....40 taco vendors? only 5 had fish/vegetarian options....which is all the tacos we really needed, but shizznit man, how many takes of a beef/pork/chicken taco can one event showcase? again, creativity NILL!it is HOT as hades so bring sunscreen and a hat. i actually saw folks with umbrellas/parasols which made me cringe, but also made me jealous of their individual shade. some vendors take cash, but most take tokens. bring cash or pay the ATM fees. bathrooms, ATM's, water stalls, wrestling, chihuahua fashion shows, and more tattoos than you can shake a stick at!
1	Well over priced, not only is there a entrance fee, but to food is small and expensive. $105 for 4 drinks and 12 baby size tacos. WOW what a deal. For the amount of food and price, there should be no entrance fee. Not to mention the quality was very sub par.Extremely unorganized, would never attend this again
3	Taco Festival?  Hell yes, I'm listening!  Came here with some friends and had an ok time.  There was some good, some bad, some ugly.  Here they are...........Good-  1.  Lots of vendors.  2.  Half price Yelp tickets (the site they go through still charges a $4.33 "convenience fee" though).  Basically $8.50 a ticket instead of $12.00 at the gate.  3.  Free parking.  4.  Pork Tacos-  Pork was by far the star of the show.  I had some really great pork tacos. 5.  Rubios blackened tilapia taco.  Might have been the best taco I had all day.  It was delicious and spicy!   6.  Other vendors (kettle corn, Gelato Spot, corn on the cob etc).Bad-  1.  Crowded as a mofo in the afternoon.  We were smart and arrived right at 11am, got in, ate and got out.  By the time we were leaving, lines were 50-100 deep to get a taco at some spots.  Redonkulous!  2.  Pricey!  $2.00 a taco, $2.00 a bottle of water, $6.00 beers!Ugly-  1.  Hot as a mofo!  It was like 95 degrees out, no clouds, baking hot, minimal shady areas, nowhere to sit etc.  2.  Carne Asada....meh!  I had a few different asada tacos and none of them were any good.  The last carne asada taco I ate, right before we left,  was horrible.  3.  The line to get in if you did not pre purchase your tickets.  We left at about 1:00 and there was a line about half a mile long, just to get in!  3.  Some stands ran out of their signature tacos pretty early.  This festival lasted until 7:00pm supposedly....people there late were probably assed out as far as taco selection goes.Overall, I had a blast with the people I went with.  The tacos were alright, although pricey.  The fact that it was so hot and there was so little shade made it a bitch too.  I would return though!  Tacos are like pizza...even when its bad, its still pretty good!
