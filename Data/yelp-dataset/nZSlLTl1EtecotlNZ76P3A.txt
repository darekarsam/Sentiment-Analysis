5	Tea heaven! I went in and asked if their was anything he suggests for a cold or sore throat ad he was happy to help. So bummed that this place was put in after I moved but I'll be sure to visit every time I visit!
5	An open minded business with lots of interesting options and offerings.  They also provide fermented teas, savory herbs and homeopathic teas.  Daily special.  No, I don't work there, I'm just an enthusiast.  Enjoyed the Sheng Pu-erh https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pu-erh_tea
5	This is one of the places I miss most now that I've moved out of Lawrneceville! Get a cup to go and/or some loose leaf tea for later. The staff is very friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable. My favorite teas so far are the Roasted Mate, Chai Mate, and Hearts of Hunan (spelling?),
4	A great selection of teas with knowledgable and friendly staff. My only complaint is that this store isn't more like a cafe. I would love to take a load off and do some work online while I sip on my tea.
5	I am so happy that my friend recommended I stop into this place. I am an avid tea drinker, even in the summer, and was thrilled to stop into a shop with such a variety and broad selection. They have everything from my (favorite) low-brow 'breakfast' varieties, including Scottish, Irish, English, and more, to really nicely spiced chais, a dizzying amount of herbal tisanes, greens, whites, etc. I suggested they start hosting classes so that peeps like me can step up our game. I got great recommendations from the staff and they introduced me to new teas I am really getting into!
5	outstanding. friendly and they know how to blend tea.  also prices are very reasonable for the quality put forth. worth the trip.
