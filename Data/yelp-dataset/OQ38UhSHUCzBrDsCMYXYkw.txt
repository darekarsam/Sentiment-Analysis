1	This is a terrible company to work with! We chose Statewide Lighting because I had worked with them professionally. We ordered 3 pendant lights from them last September. One stopped working in November and it took WEEKS for them to order a part that was needed to fix it. Endless phone calls were not returned and it took a lot longer than it should have. We also had to bring it in, leave it there to be fixed and then pick it up. Not convenient! About 2 months ago, the same light stopped working plus another one. We have made about 8 calls and only one has been returned. The man who answers the phone pretends not to know us and still, even after sending a certified letter - no returned calls. We have now contacted the manufacturer to get them to help us. We would like to return them all together and choose a better company to work with. At this point we are disgusted and really want to warn anyone out there who is thinking of using this company. DON'T. It's not worth your time and frustration. In a time where companies should be relishing business - they don't. They should be ashamed for treating customers like this... and we know them.
5	the previous posting seems quite unfair to me, as the complaints stem from the lighting manufacturer rather than the retailer. This morning I visited Statewide Lighting to browse the exterior lighting.  I was very impressed with the attention I received.  Although the man at the desk (Bob) was juggling an number of tasks and interruptions due to an employee absence on this particular morning, he was right there to assist me at every moment that I needed him, cheerfully and intelligently answered all my questions.  I was rather a high maintenance customer at a busy time for him, and yet I was treated with the utmost patience and respect.  I have been to almost every lighting showroom in Scottsdale, and this was my best experience.
