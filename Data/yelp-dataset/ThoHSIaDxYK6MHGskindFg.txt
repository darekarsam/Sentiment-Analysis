5	Love this place! It's a used book store that offers at least 50% off their books. Fabulous. I could explore the aisles all afternoon. They have a big poetry section and even carry contemporary poets, like Sharon Olds. Here is where I was given one of her more famous books, The Father. Literally. In the aisle. I was given the book. As a present. So thoughtful! Now that makes for one incredible memory, don't you think? As I explored the fiction section, I saw many books that piqued my interest. In checking the price, I discovered I can pick up a new read for less than a Starbucks latte. Now that's a sweet deal. Seriously, who can resist a new book for $4 to $7? Also, it's easy to find with plenty of parking. It's next door to Divinity Tattoo on Scottsdale Road, a hair North of Thomas (east side of the street). Great location, especially since it's in my 'hood.This is now my go-to place for quality used books!
4	Ahhhh.... Now here's a reasonably priced used book store with a wide selection. Many thanks to Alicia for the recommendation. Could definitely have spent more time and money here but somehow managed to pull  myself away with a few choice Joyce Carol Oates short story collections I haven't been able to find at Bookman's or Half Price Books. I know, I know, just order them online, right - but where's the fun in that? I need the thrill of the hunt! Friendly & knowledgeable staff, wide selection, good location... what else can you ask for?
