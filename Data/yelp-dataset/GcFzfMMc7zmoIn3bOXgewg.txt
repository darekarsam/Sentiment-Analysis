5	They are stellar at what they do, and that is keeping you safe. Highly recommend.
2	I was impressed at first. I left a message to schedule an apt and was contacted immediately. The gentleman who came to view my property and discuss my security needs was prompt, helpful and informative. He told me to expect an estimate within a week. And that is where my positive experience ended. It has now been over two weeks and a few email inquiries later and no response. I guess they don't want my business? Regardless I am unimpressed and sorry that they wasted my time.
5	I was very impressed that they came out to our home to provide a detailed evaluation. they customized a solution to best fit my needs and the gentleman explained everything to me in simple terms. the installation was very professional and I am very happy with the result. They did not treat me like another monitored account, they really cared and treted me like. VIP client. Thanks ICU. I now feel safe in my home again
5	The ICU group did a thorough review of my property and security needs and provided fast service. One of the owners, Bill Wilm, was especially helpful and even followed up to insure we were totally satisfied. A first class company!
