5	Great experience with them last night. The driver was right on time, the car was spotless and impressive looking, everyone I dealt with at the company was very friendly and professional. Their prices include tax, tip and all other fees so there were no surprise charges at the end of the night. I would use their services again!
5	Amazing!!!I called them last minute at 11 pm to pick up my boss from the airport at 6 a.m.  Sean at Dispatch said, 'no problem, we'll make it happen'.  And they did!  My boss said the driver, Lloyd, was there on time -- and was funny, professional and all around FANTASTIC!!  I am a super happy customer and I strongly recommend Peak Limo!
5	I happened upon Peak Limo when I was in Charlotte on business a couple years ago. Since then, I have used them several times for business but most recently for a personal trip with my husband and some friends. Their drivers and staff have always been professional and accommodating. Prices are in line with those that I shopped previously. Most importantly, they are always where they say they will be when booked which is important when you are traveling.
5	Responsive and professional.   On time and clean upscale car.   Would use them again.
5	Lloyd was the associate who picked us up. 4:30 in the morning and he was there early! Very friendly and professional. Great vehicle. Great service. Would not consider using another service after this experience.
