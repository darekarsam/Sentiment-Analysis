4	Nice small complex in north central phoenix.  Very affordable with rent / utlities / internet / cable included.  Mostly studio apts, but they are pretty big compared to studios at most places.  Only a handful of 1 bedroom units.  Mostly bachelors, which is fine with me.  No kids and no dogs, which again is fine with me.  Covered parking.  Kitchens could use some updating, and the common area & parking lot could use a good power washing, which would really spruce the place up.  Nice pool.  The neighbors have a weekly poker game going on, which is kinda cool.  I have really liked living here, its quiet and comfortable, no frills and affordable in an area that can be pricey.
1	STOP !! unless you are into drugs drinking & staying up all night do not think of living here. do you like to smell mold and watch bugs all the time, this place is for you. if you like to sneak around in the shadows so does the mgmt. don't worry when you go out the mgmt. will keep an eye out inside & out! if you enjoy gambling this is the place!!                                    ENJOY
1	The manager here is dishonest and shady.  We were told there were 2 studios available and we viewed them. We told him we wanted the bottom studio, the carpet in the top one stunk and made the apt stink.  We filled out an application and paid $60 for back ground checks.  He told us later someone viewed it but he has not heard back from them and they probably won't return.  So at the end of the next day he calls and says we are approved but he called the other person and they decided to take it and already put a holding deposit on it.  I asked for the $60 back because he never told us they already put a holding deposit.  He refused saying he explained it to us when all he said was someone else looked and has not called back about it. Glad we didn't rent from a landlord who's dishonest.
