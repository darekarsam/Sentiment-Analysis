5	Amazing photography and customer service!  We were drawn to Aimee's photos right away on her website. We loved how original and unique her editing and locations were in comparison to all the other millions of photographers out there.  Aimee's background in art and artistic eye is what makes the difference and keeps her photos from being over edited and eye catching.  Aimee was able to relate to my children right away and make them comfortable and capture them in our photo shoot sessions.  You will be happy with every dollar you spend!
5	I can highly recommend Aimee Bar-Am Photography. Aimee and her husband came to our house for an on location newborn photo shoot. They supplied backdrops, floor scenes, lighting, props and everything else needed for the session. Aimee was extremely professional, she knows how to work with babies and kids as she has her own, and most importantly, she can set up and capture stunning images. We loved the resulting photos and were so happy with the whole experience!
