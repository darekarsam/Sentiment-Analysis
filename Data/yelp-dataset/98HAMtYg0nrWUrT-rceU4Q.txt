4	This is one of my favourite hidden coffee shops downtown. It's actually located inside the Alcan building, so few people even know it exits, making it great for evading the bustle and crowds of downtown cafes.Coffee's excellent, and the sandwiches are made fresh to order. They have outdoor seating in the cute little garden that's hidden between this building and its neighbour. A little bit of peace right downtown....
1	Not open to the public! Only for the employees in the building. Don't trek out here in the snow and be disappointed like I did. To be fair, I have no doubt that this place is a four or five star establishment for people in the building! But for the general public, this is a no star as it is a no-go.
