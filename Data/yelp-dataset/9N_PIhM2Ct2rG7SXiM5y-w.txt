3	Large DSW, but really caters more to women. That would be great if I wore heels, but unfortunately I don't. The mens dress shoe selection is pretty scarce. They have a decent selection of sneakers and stuff though.
4	I've shopped here several times before and have always been pleased with the selection and prices.They did a complete reset of the store (since my last visit), so I was very happy with the new layout of the store. It doesn't look so overwhelming. Shoes are displayed nicely & sizes are below each display. My most recent visit brought me in looking for Converse All Stars aka Chuck Taylors, but sadly, they didn't have my size. I wasn't approached by any salespeople, which in this case, one wasn't needed. I'm familiar with their policy of "ship to your home" or the ability to find my size in another store. I can easily do those things on my own via the website.They have a rewards program, which would come in handy for you frequent shoe shoppers. I am a member, but I am not a shoe hoarder. :D The store is clean, organized, has plenty of employees, prices are reasonable, they have a lot of popular, designer brands. Parking right in front of the store; however, they do share the lot with Sports Authority & Petco.
1	Be sure to read their return policy because it's not told to you at check out or on the back of the receipt. You have to read the fine print at the register or go on their website. Had to get store credit for a pair of shoes that I wore for less than 4 hours because they were too painful to wear. Will not be back.
