5	My experience at Express Urgent Care was very positive.   Staff were friendly and helpful with filing out paperwork.   I was moved into an exam room in less than 10 minutes after arrival.  The doctor was knowledgable and treated me with compassion.  I left the clinic very satisfied.
5	My husband and I are snowbirds and we are here for the winter.  My husband fell off the ladder and I brought him to this urgent care because my neighbor had great experiences from them.  The doctor and staff were extremely caring. They got us in right away and got xray of his hips. We were in and out in less than an hour.  Thank God my husband did not have a hip fracture. It was just a "contusion."  He was given pain medication. ( I have given the ladder away to a friend ).   Great place! We have no doctor here in AZ and we will use this place for our medical needs.

Thanks to everyone responsible for my quick recovery! Vivian, PA David, and MA David are consummate professionals! Thank you very much!
1	Rude!Went in yesterday. The wait was 2 hours so I told the front desk lady that I would come back later. She snapped back what their hours are and I told her that I'm aware of their hours.Needless to say, I didn't return to this Urgent Care based on the impoliteness of the front desk.
3	Went to Thomas and 92ave location.  Don't go there
