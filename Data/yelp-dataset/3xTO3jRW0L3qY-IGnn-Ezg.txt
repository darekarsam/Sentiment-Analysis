5	Jake is a great guitar teacher, and has patience with our 5 year old. We love that we can see the lesson without being a distraction.  Quick to respond to questions without being pushy.  Great cost for lessons
5	I have been taking drum lessons and my daughter has been taking classical guitar lessons for the past two months at Nevada Music Academy. I have wanted to take drum lessons since I was a kid and I'm now almost 50. My drum teacher Mark customizes the lessons for my musical preferences and makes the lessons really fun. Sergey, my daughter's guitar teacher is also very skilled.  Not only are the music instructors  highly qualified, they make the lessons fun that you want to keep learning.
5	My eight year old son has been taking drum lessons from Mark at NV Music Academy for two months.  He had never had a lesson before in his life, just an interest.  Thanks to Mark and his passion and dedication my little one is already reading music which is amazing!  The staff and ownership of the facility are perfect.  It's clean, convenient and has plenty of reading material to keep me content and relaxed while I can hear him practicing down the hall.  I highly recommend!
5	Great experience with Josh. He was helpful, efficient and understanding of my circumstance. I was able to relate to the material and he gave me effective tools to practice on my own .
