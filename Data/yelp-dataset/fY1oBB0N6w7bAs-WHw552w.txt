3	The guys at this location have been really good to me for the car repairs that I have sprung on them on short notice. On another note if you buy tires from them they don't charge you for repairs on them. That is pretty sweet but they might try and nickle and dime you on petty stuff like license plate bulbs, I simply say thanks and change it myself.
1	Get back in your car and drive far, far away in the opposite direction.   I came in for an oil change and left with $700 worth of unrelated damage to my ride.  Best case scenario they are grossly incompetent and don't know a Honda from their left butt cheek.  Worst case scenario they deliberate sabotage things in order to elicit further business.  Whether it's negligence or malfeasance, I've learned a valuable lesson- that convenience and "affordability" are not worth the risk you're taking going to one of these places.  While a good mechanic is hard to find (after all, the word mechanic comes from the Greek for "trickery/craftiness"), one is worth searching out (and yes, I did take my car somewhere else for the repairs!)
5	I've had nothing but good experiences at this location. They always get me in on short notice. The staff is very professional and polite. My car has always been serviced to my satisfaction and in a timely fashion each visit. As a younger female, I'm always skeptical about auto guys trying to up sell  me on things I don't need, but they've never tried that on me which is really nice. Pricing is fair and they have great promotions.  I would recommend this location to anyone in the area!
