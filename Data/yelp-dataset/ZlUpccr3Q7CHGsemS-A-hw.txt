4	Great store that includes two floors of fashion bargains. I am not sure what distinguishes XXI Forever and Forever 21 in the US, but it is basically the same stuff. I picked up a cute new tunic in here. Store is very clean and well maintained and the staff in the dressing room were friendly. Definitely a lot nicer than some Forever 21 stores I've visited in the US.
4	I did some shopping here and I'm impressed. This store has trendy clothes for girls and boys for inexpensive prices. I noticed that the people working here are helpful and kind even though they have a lot of people trying to get their attention for help or to answer a question. The store has two levels, and both had many people there making it a tad bit difficult to shop, but that didn't stop me. You can find everything from hats, gloves, jewellery, bags, stockings, shoes, jackets, tunics, tops, skirts, pants, sleepwear, undergarments etc.I'm surprised how the store has everything neat and organized considering how many people are in there. I saw many workers there organizing and fixing racks of clothes and tidying things up.This is a great place to shop if you're looking for inexpensive trendy clothes!
4	I've always been a fan of XXI Forever. But I think you'd be better off buying the stuff online. I have absolutely zero idea how they organized their store. The one on University is smaller than the one near Guy, so it's even more frustrating trying to locate a piece of clothing you saw online. And the staffs are always busy, so you can't really ask them for help.
