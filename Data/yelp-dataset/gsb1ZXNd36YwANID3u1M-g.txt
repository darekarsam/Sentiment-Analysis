3	Pizza's ok. Customer service is awful.
2	The place is clean and updated, which is a plus, but everything else was sort of lacking.  The service was slow, the food was mediocre.
4	Nice atmosphere, the building was converted from an old car wash. The pizza is decent. Cheeseburger pizza is our favorite, it's really really good.
4	Tasty pizza and nice atmosphere. Be warned that soft drinks get one free refill.  We had the cheese breadstick appetizer and BBQ chicken pizza. Both were tasty. The Mac n Cheese pizza is our family favorite and ice cream cones for dessert- yum!
1	Terrible service, the owner nickel and dimes you on everything. Even charges more for a "to go" cup.
2	This was our first time trying this place. We ordered a Hawaiian pizza and breadsticks. After a couple bites my husband and I decided this was the worst pizza we had ever had. (I am sorry!!!).  The ingredients just weren't fresh or something. All the flavor was noon existent. Sauce has no flavor, breadsticks literally were just bread.  Just no good.I will say that the friendly staff at the pick up window and who took our order brought the review from 1 to 2 stars.  I sincerely want to support local business, but we won't buy that pizza again. Sorry!
