1	WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!! so many hidden fees! Worst customer service ever! Buy your own water. Better yet, purchase a filter. Do not waste your time or MONEY!
2	My order has never been correct,they didn't deliver until I called them to tell them there was no delivery and I had tainted water in all the bottles they finally did deliver that they said was a bad batch....how can you have a bad batch??? I asked for purified water I got Alkaline water, I asked to change my order to 4 bottles( and this morning I left 4 empties outside and told the driver who called last night to make sure I get 4 bottles) I still got 3 Alkaline bottles. Someone in this company is too money hungry to staff the company according to their service needs. Mike is the boss and told me to ask for him if I have a problem...it's been nothing but problems. I usually give any company a chance to correct a mistake or two but this company can never seem to get it right. Stay away from them if you don't want to have to constantly call them. Too much of a hassle I have better things to do with my time. I have 3 more months left on my contract of 6 months I can't wait until it's over this company is a joke!!!
4	I love NV Crystal Premiums customer service. They have never been wrong with my order. I get a text reminder the day before delivery which is so convenient. Brenda is always a pleasure to talk too and Fernando is very helpful in bringing in my order if i happen to catch him during deliver hours. I cant say anything bad about this company because simply they are good at what they do and the best in Vegas :-)
3	They finally got it right and no more problems.
