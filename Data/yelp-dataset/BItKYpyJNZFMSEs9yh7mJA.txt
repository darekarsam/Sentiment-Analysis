4	Wooo!  Stopped by when a friend said to meet him at 1905.  Really nicely decorated and updated space. The restaurant is small.  Ordered from the bar/old wood counter (this place must have been a bar or small market at one time) that had some nice tile glass on it.  Not a lot of tables.  It was not crowded, but it will probably pick up as word gets out.  The wait staff at the counter was very friendly and helpful. They stated, "we could sit and they would come and take our order".  The menu had some nice dinner options and some sandwiches, a panini of the day, soup, salad.  There was a shrimp scampi salad of the day. Ordered the veal parm. sandwich.  The waitress said the veal was fresh and not a patty.  The sandwich was so good.  Nice piece of veal cooked perfectly.  For a side I had a rigatoni salad that the waitress said was made this a.m.  Asked if BYOB.  Was told yes but they only have cups for the soda dispenser.  So it is BYOwine glass, too.  Soft music playing in the background.Only wish they would fix the banging door.
5	Authentic Italian! This little gem gets 5 stars. It is a byob (which I love) and they DO have wine glasses. Maybe they didn't have them when they first opened, but they absolutely have them now. The food was to die for! There were 5 of us, and everything I tried was phenomenal!! Very clean, excellent service. Highly recommended, and defiantly plan on going back.
2	It didn't live up to the hype as the food was not hot enough and the service was inflexible to do something slightly off the menu. There are a lot of better BYOB places in the Burgh.
