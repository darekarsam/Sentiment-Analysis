4	I've been living here for a few weeks and was really freaked out by all these reviews I was reading on apartments.com about how terrible this place is.But... I love it! I have a roomy one bedroom apartment for 600 dollars and my apartment has great heating and air conditioning. I have access to two pools and the community lounge has free coffee (free donut Fridays!) and they do cool events on the weekends for their tenants. Rent can be paid online and the maintenance can be requested online too. The front office is insanely helpful and quick to help you out with all needs you have. I would highly check this place out as an apartment consideration. Located right off of 7th and bell you are walking distance to EVERYTHING. I'll definitely update this review if anything changes lol
1	I lived here for five months and hated every single day. The walls are thin the neighbors are loud and the maintence does not respond when needed. The front office staff is always changing ( there were two different managers since I moved in) and they aren't helpful at all. I would never live here or recommend this place to anyone unless I hated you and wanted you to suffer. Save yourselves from a crappy apartment and a waste of money and go somewhere else.
4	I used to live in this apartment complex in 2009, and my boyfriend does now.  The quality of the apartments have been pretty consistent. The nice thing is that the cost is reasonable. The place can look cute if you dress it up.  They are basic apartments though,  (cupboards made with particle board,  laminate counters, etc) and you should expect that given the price.   The walls are VERY thin so is better to live upstairs if you are noise sensitive.
