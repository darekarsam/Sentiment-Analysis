5	U dnt know what these ppl are talking about ! Messy .. Uhh yeah ... Apparently no one has been to the real messy ones like the one in Nellis ..anyways ! LUV THIS PLACE ! So much variety !!
3	This is one of the better Ross stores in my area (meaning within 15-20min) seems to be clean and well stocked when I visit most times. Employees have always been kind, courteous and helpful. Always a good variety of items in stock, things seem to be pretty organized for the most part.
4	I don't know if it's just luck but I always find good stuff when I go to this location. You have to dig and hunt but I usually walk out with something. It's not very organized, always insanely busy, and a bit understaffed but if you have the time and the patience it's worth it. Every Ross I've ever been in is always unorganized...it just makes me feel more accomplished when I do find some treasures. To me it's a fair trade off for the great deals.
1	Stopped at this Ross to return shoes i bought because it was convenient.  i was told because I had worn them, they wouldn't accept them!  I wore them once. I had the receipt.  It took me demanding to see the manager not just have them speak to the cashier over the headset for them to take them back! I have NEVER been told Anywhere I couldn't retyrn an item with a receipt. ...worn or washed or falling apart!  I would normally have shopped for something else. .....not in that store. Never again.  The Only reason they get one star is because i did get my money back.
