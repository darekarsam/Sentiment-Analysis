4	These have got to be the nicest public tennis courts I have ever seen!
3	Great place since there are a ton of courts in one place so you don't end up wasting time waiting to get on one.Depending on which court you get on though, there are some "dead-spots" so you get an occasional weird bounce.Seems like in it's hay day, there used to be some tennis tournaments that would come through - since there is a center court set up.  Don't know if they still use the tennis center as much, but it would be nice to see an event there.Plenty of parking... you just have to contend with volley ball players and Frisbee golf players that are using the other aspects of the park near the tennis courts.10/15/10 - Just played a match there... they've repainted the courts!  They look great, but there are still dead spots on the court :(
4	Large tennis complex off Tyvola & Tryon. Close to Uptown and a good place to go if the Freedom Park courts are packed. It has more courts than Park Road and is in better condition in my opinion. There is a large stadium court as a previous reviewer has mentioned and would be cool to play on though I have not yet. As with every tennis court in town be prepared for league play during the week so you may have to wait. That said; there are enough courts here to make that a slim possibility.
