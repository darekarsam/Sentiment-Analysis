5	Sheryl, the salon owner, has extensive experience with cuts and color. The first time I went to her, she spent a lot of time analyzing my hair (texture, thickness, health), lifestyle, and the shape of my head and face before beginning to cut. I had also allowed my color to grow out, but after a conversation with Sheryl about options, she added the perfect type of color to my graying hair. The resulting cut and color were superb - the best I've had in years. It looks good, is easy to work with, and has produced lots of "good hair" days.The salon is very casual, and parking is easy.Highly recommended.
5	Just returned home after another fabulous cut and colour by Sheryl!  I have extremely thick, course hair and no one can cut and take the  weight out like her.  I highly recommend her expertise in colouring, cut and style.  I have been following her for years and always rely on her recommendations.
5	Sheryl is the hair professional I have been searching for my whole adult life! She really takes the time to figure out the best hairstyle and color for you and has extensive knowledge. She has helped everyone in my family with hair issues and even made some really helpful suggestions for my teenager with oily hair. I absolutely can not say enough about her! She is a blast to talk to and brings a very happy energy to the salon.
