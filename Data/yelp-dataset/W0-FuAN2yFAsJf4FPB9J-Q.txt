4	This is authentic Liberian food, I recommend the cassava leaf if it is available. The restaurant is basic but the food is good and spicy if you need it to be, ask for extra pepper.
4	Zoewee's has the best food I've had in a long time!! The food is always fresh and the portions are plentiful. I'm not big on spicy foods, but the seasonings are always on point here! I don't know what I'm going to do when I move and can't get to this place!! I do know that Zoewee's will be at the top of my list of thing to do when I visit the QC!!
5	Awesome Food! A group of our office randomly decided to stop by this place today. Don't let the simple dining room fool you... The food is complex and is definitely home made 100%! I've never had Liberian food, but wow, they do it right! The guy who sat us, understood that we didn't have a clue what to order so he brought us a free little sampler of some of their dishes. After a few bites I knew exactly what to get! Potato Greens with Rice! They definitely work at a slower pace there so don't expect a 20 minute lunch... Plan on being there for at least an hour... 5 Stars!
4	As a Liberian and a chef I'm very picky about Liberian food. This place did not let me down. I had the fufu & soup and tried some of the palava sauce & rice my mom ordered. Both were great! I gave it 4 stars because the service is VERY slow. I know what goes into cooking Liberian food and I know how a restaurant kitchen works and there's no excuse for all the lag time. Every one is very nice though. Definitely recommend and I'll be back the next time I'm in Charlotte!
