5	I retained Mr. Marc Saggese, for a criminal record sealing, three years ago. He and his staff, walked me through the entire process. It could not have gone any smoother. Nearly six months ago, I again retained Mr. Marc Saggese, for a traffic ticket and a warrant. The staff scheduled my appointment, and within three days, Marc was at the Court House, taking care of it. I have now referred my father-in-law to the firm for his personal injury case, and a friend for her DUI, both of which, are thankful. I highly recommend Marc Saggese, because he cares about his clients and follows through.
5	I usually dont leave many yelp reviews, but only when I know it is well deserved. My father had heard of Marc through his boxing buddies, so when I had speeding ticket (on a suspended license mind you!) I thought... why would a huge attorney want to waste time on a speeding ticket, but without a thought he and his team took care of me.  NO JOKE a month later... HI DUI! His office staff was beyond professional and walked me through the whole process. He treated me like a friend, not just a client. I called them for every possible question and they never made me feel like I was bothering them. I promise, there is no case too big or too large for Marc. He is high-powered. I heard they even had a TV show about him. Anyway...i can pretty much guarantee you will be satisfied!
5	Attorney Marc Saggese is totally spectacular! I had left a review for him at a previous law firm and have had to use him on two different occasions since that 2010 car accident - and what can I say?  That the people at this law firm are so great they will become your life long friends!  And, they will get unbelievable, and in my opinion - seemingly impossible results!!Should you get you need help - go to Saggese & Associates and get treated like you are their number one client!!THE BEST!!!
