2	Deep-fried chicken, fish, polish sausage, wings, fries, and okra (only). No frills place at the corner of Washington and Philo in Urbana - parking for 4 cars, seating for the same. Awesome home-made sauce, but that would be the only reason I would ever go back.
5	Best chicken 'n fish type place in central illinois hands down.  Get the wings and catfish nuggets with PLENTY of "scully sauce" on top or on the side. Make sure to chat with scully himself (tall black guy who usually works there alone) he's one of the nicest people around and has all sorts of wild stories to tell.Mondays are supposed to be "motor cycle mondays" where bikers from all over go there to eat so check that out if you're into that stuff.
3	I got the fried chicken (which is just wings basically) combo and fried okra. Service was a bit slow and honestly, I was a little disappointed since people said this place is the best fried chicken in town. I think KFC is better than this, and I hate KFC. Nice people though. Next time i'll order the walleye sandwich or the catfish nuggets; people I ate with said they were good. Please carpool though, there's a whopping 3 parking spots and 1 handicapped spot.
