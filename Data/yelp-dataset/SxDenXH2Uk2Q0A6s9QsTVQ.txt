4	I live about a 35 minute walk away and make a point of coming here on a weekly basis.  Their muffins are just the perfect amount of sweetness (especially the chocolate hazelnut one) and their baguettes are wonderful.  They're organic and don't use any sugar, and you can feel the difference---it doesn't make you tired or low-energy after eating, unlike other bakeries.  I'd rate it 5 stars if it were a little less expensive, but I do understand that you get what you pay for (especially when it's organic...).
