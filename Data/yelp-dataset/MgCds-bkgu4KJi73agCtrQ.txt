4	Ah Canada, home of new and interesting coffee places. Second Cup was by far my favorite caffeine stop while visiting Montreal. I visited this location three times and loved their coffee so much that I picked up some to take home and some to give to my mother (who is a noted coffee persnickety person and hard to place). Very nice store. Yes, it did remind me of Starbucks. The seating was pretty limited and it filled up fast. I felt more at ease earlier in the day when there were fewer customers. I tried the pumpkin coffee and it was delicious. Prices were good, again similar to Starbucks. The bags of coffee are pretty expensive though but I think part of the proceeds benefit children in poor nations so I don't mind paying more for a good cause.
4	This place is great. I visited on my last day in Montreal; the service was the best part. My cashier was super nice and instantly switches to English when she realized that I did not speak French! I would definitely recommend this place for a coffee and a pastry!
3	The barista was really clumsy and had dirty dishes across the whole working station. I ordered the Green Tea Latte and it tasted... weird.The tables are also very dirty, empty cups and plates everywhere. During rainy days, you can expect lots of homeless people there as well.Seatings were very limited and the place was really LOUD.
3	not a bad coffee shop next to UQAM so you'll see plenty of students at all time of the day studying or working on assignments or maybe on dates. hey, its not a bad date place when you're in between classes.place is cramped with tables all so closed together. coffee is not bad, food is just bleh. and free wifi is a life saver. price wise, its pretty cheap.there's plenty of homeless after 6pm but i personally don't mind them
4	One of the best hot chocolates I've ever had in my life. Try it and fall in love!
