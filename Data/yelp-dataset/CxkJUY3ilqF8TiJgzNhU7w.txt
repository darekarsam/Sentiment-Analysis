5	I love this place! Always a friendly staff and they are very involved in facilitating pet adoptions. They have great food and treat options for your pets. I buy Earthborn for my two dogs and cats. They have a buy 10 bags, get 1 free at this location. I was also impressed with the prices. In most cases, they are less expensive than Petsmart when comparing the same or similiar products.I am loyal.
