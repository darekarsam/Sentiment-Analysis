5	I was blown away by Iris, when we visited. Thistle Street is one of my favourite eating and drinking districts in Edinburgh, and this place only served to increase my adoration.Overall, we said: "Iris offers extremely high quality food, in swish surroundings, with excellent, friendly, knowledgeable service. The only other person I've heard extolling its virtues is ardent Yelper Jurgen, who is a great fan of the place. I'd like to confirm that I will be joining Jurgen's chorus of appreciation, as the place is something really very special. It shines bright in a street of precious Edinburgh jewels. I'd suggest you pay it a visit soon. You will be richly rewarded."
2	We just ate here on a whim, sure that all these great reviews could not lead us astray. Two hours later, we have our answer: Yelp has failed us. Our starter was given away to the table behind us (with no apology, though we could clearly hear the servers discussing the mistake), my husband did not get the menu item he ordered, and my dish (lamb rack) was hardly tasty enough to make up for the tiny portion and eternal wait. When we got our bill, the server left us with the credit card machine for so long that we finished the process ourselves and had to leave the machine on the table. I think most of these issues could be solved with more employees.  I'd steer clear of Iris until they get more and/or better staff.
