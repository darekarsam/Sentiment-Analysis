5	I needed a trim real bad and honestly I wasn't expecting a great cut, however, I was pleasantly surprised how it looked.  This was my first visit here.  The place was very busy but had a full staff so I didn't have to wait long at all.  Xavier took time to really listen to what I wanted and exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommend this establishment.
