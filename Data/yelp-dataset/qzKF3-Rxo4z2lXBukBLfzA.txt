5	I was admiring a piece of vintage hand painted furniture at Bond Nail Salon and the owner, Shawna, referred me to Vintage Key Antiques. Cori, one of the owners, takes vintage wood furniture and customizes it with a variety of paint finishes. I love that she takes old furniture and upcycles/reinvents it to suit the client's taste. The furniture is reasonably priced unfinished, and you pay an additional fee for painting/customization -- the price points vary depending on the level of detail and complexity involved in painting the piece, since most of the work is done by hand. They also have finished pieces available for sale. Their facebook page has a lot of photos of past projects, with amazing before and after photos, as well as an album of current inventory.  https://www.facebook.com/vintagekeyantiques?ref=br_tf. I've purchased 6 pieces from her so far, and have received 4 of them, all of which I absolutely love. I can't wait to get my next 2 pieces, a beautiful vintage buffet and a bookcase. Each piece is a one-of-a-kind work of art. No more flat pack, big box furniture for this gal!  Love love love!
5	Amazing one of a kind furniture!  I have purchased several items for my new home and love everything I chose.  Everything is hand painted and has a special touch.  Owners are very nice and have a delivery service available to assist you if you don't own a truck.  Check it out!!
5	I visited this store in November because my bestie didn't want to drive to Victorville to view an antique desk. So, she pulled up the first place on her search engine and we took a gamble. The store is huge inside(2 stories), you'll need good walking shoes and at least 2 hours to take it all in. They have beautiful stuff here. I bought a beautiful antique vanity to just die over. Saved a trip to Cali. Great customer services and worked w me on a good price for the desk.
