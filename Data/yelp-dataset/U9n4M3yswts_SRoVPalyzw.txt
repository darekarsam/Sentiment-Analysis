5	I was in a car accident and my insurance Progressive, secured a rental with Enterprise. When I arrived through the door, I was greeted by a huge smile and very polite Jeremy . He asked if I was there to rent or return. I soberly told him that my insurance had called for me. He perked up and said "Sharman?" I was a little surprised.. "yes!"  he pulled out keys and paperwork that was already completed and all I had to do was sign.THAT EASY! I went out to a new toyota corolla, completely loaded... and drove away.AWESOME service...
5	The very best service after getting the run a round from an other Enterprise locationI'll be back to this enterprise outlet.Thank You for a Five Star Service.From a long time user of enterprise.If I could give more then five stars I would.How about 10 stars?Again Thank You
5	I rent a car about once a month for business and have used this location for years.  I always have a good experience.  The staff is helpful and friendly and if there is a mistake, which there seldom is, I feel they always make things right.  I would recommend them to anyone.
1	Reserved a car for noon. Showed up late (my fault) to find they rented my car to someone else; didn't bother to call me (their fault). Both employees were on the phone when we got there and didn't bother to acknowledge us for at least 5 minutes. They said they could get me another car from another location if I was willing to wait 45 min. So Make sure you call or show up on time because their inventory is like 2 cars.
