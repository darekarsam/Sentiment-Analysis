4	Vegan Co-op with great food and awesome people! We were lucky to have a friend in Montreal show us this place, because we would have never discovered it on our own. It made my traveling vegetarian heart very warm and happy :)
5	One of the original coffeehouses making a home for folk music in Canada, the Yellow Door is a tiny epicenter of goodness in the McGill ghetto. In addition to the music venue in the basement, the Yellow Door is home to multi-faith advisory and free zen meditation, and the Generations Project which supports seniors in Montreal's downtown through volunteerism and social activities. Huge heart.
5	This is a wonderful oasis of excellent vegetarian cuisine, perfectly brewed coffee and inspiring community activism and organisation in the McGill Ghetto. This is the archetypal secluded coffeehouse; off the beaten path indeed! There is beautiful live music regularly as well. Come here in between classes to have a coffee and a break. Read a book, put your feet up, contemplate the universe and daydream. Come to The Yellow Door and see the sunshine.
