4	I went here for breakfast during a visit with my Grandma.  This place is located in your typical active senior living community clubhouse thing.  It was nice and overlooked the golf course.  It was about 11am on a Sunday and wasn't overly crowded which surprised me.Their menu was pretty standard and had all your typical breakfast fare at very reasonable prices.  I opted for the omelet station where they had a bunch of fresh ingredients to add, fruit, pastries, carved ham and other misc. stuff.  It was all very good and my omelet turned out excellent.The service was fast and friendly.  It really does take a very special type of person to work at a place that serves almost exclusively older folks who are very demanding and can be very difficult at times.If I am ever in the area around breakfast time and visiting Grandma then I would definitely return.
4	Mother's Day brunch was solid.  Nice casual brunch in the ballroom.  Food was good. Enough for both kids and adults to enjoy. Would do again for future holidays like Mother's Day and Father's Day.
2	I had dinner there with my family.  I  invited my family to the clubhouse since i was a resident of oakwood country club and ironoaks community. It was usually busy on saturday nite so i made reservations.When we arrived, it was very disorganized. No one in charge or at the host desk. They had no seats even when we had reservations at 7 pm. They made us wait and people who did not have reservations were seated ahead of us.. They apparently didnt have a record of my reservations. By the time we got seated it was after 8 pm. We ordered our meals and it yet another hour before receiving our meals. The meals were nothing special and their prices are pricey...
