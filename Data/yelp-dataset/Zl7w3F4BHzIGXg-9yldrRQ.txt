4	I had a not-so-good experience at another beauty school and decided to try here.  From scheduling the appointment to getting EXACTLY what I wanted done was completely great.  I did not have to wait long to be seen by my student, which was great. The down side was that it took 6 hours for a spiral perm.  I blame that mostly for my long hair though, not the student.  I was hoping to be out of there a bit sooner, but I will still go back.  I love that the instructors are there, walking through the rows of chairs and offering help and guidance when there is a question and affirming the student's assessment of what to do next.  I see a recipe for success in each student because of the leadership of the teaching staff.  This school is maintained well and very pleasant to spend half a day in.  Even the students seemed happy to be there, learning and doing.  I will go back, and I will bring my children here to allow these students to practice!
