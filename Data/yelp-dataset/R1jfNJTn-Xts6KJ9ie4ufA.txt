5	Delicious. Get the maple donut.
4	Was going to buy groceries at Sakaris on an empty stomach and was starving, solution, stop into Samosa and get a donut, (this is not something I ever do), these are really good and huge, like a small child's head huge.... I have had both chocolate and maple, maple wins out.  I suggest you make this a dessert for two, it is that big and heavy.  If you like old school real donuts then this is the place.
5	The donuts are filling, one will fill you but I survived eating two.  I stick to the standard sugar donut but they also have maple and chocolate glazed.  I have to get them on special order because I like them heavy (with oil).  That way one is enough.  I keep the rest for dunking, of course.  A donut costs $1.25, save time and money at Samos!
3	This is not a trendy boulangerie that everyone will be tweeting about from their smart phones. Still, Nouveau Samos has been in business for almost 60 years and makes some incredible donuts.I stopped in after eyeing their HUGE donuts in the window. I picked up four donuts - two chocolate glazed, two maple - and they were incredible - not to mention only $1.25 each. I just spent twice that on 'gourmet' donuts at the trendy donut shop Chez Boris several blocks away, and was kicking myself for wasting my time, money and calories at Chez Boris after discovering Nouveau Samos.  I will definitely be back to Nouveau Samos to grab donuts! I also grabbed a loaf of sesame bread to have with my dinner. It was not the most amazing bread I've ever had, but the huge loaf was only $2 was still pretty damn good. While the taste of the bread could've been better, it's hard to beat the price, so I might get some bread there in the future, too.The real find at Nouveau Samos are the donuts! They are so good I had to add Nouveau Samos as a business on Yelp in order to let other donut hungry Montrealers know about this place. It's a real treasure tucked away on St. Laurent.
