5	I am beyond pleased with the service these guys do. I needed my lawnmower serviced and a week later it is back looking brand new and works wonderfully. They are professional, friendly and their prices are super great! Try them out before going anywhere else!!! I'm so glad that I went to them. One happy customer. =)
1	Brought my lawn mower in for service in November $89.00 so it would be ready for spring. Started it in the end of February to do a quick clean up of my yard and it just leaked gas all over the place. Call the shop they told me to bring it back. A week later I was told it would be another $89.00 that the carb was dirty. Told them no and picked it up. I ordered a carb rebuild kit on line for $6.00 and fixed it myself. Durning inspection of the carb it was a messed up o-ring that they installed that was the problem. I'll never bring them anything again.
5	Excellent customer service, quality work...very competitive pricing. I would recommend this place to anybody!
