2	This was probably one of the more dirtier and unkept Great Clips I've seen, and I've been in six states in the past few years. Their was hair on the floor and both stylists were just sitting around. The guy at the front was clueless, and asked every question twice. My guy's haircut was okay, but the lady looked like she was high. I wouldn't have personally trusted these folks for a women's cut.
5	I used to hate getting my haircut, made me nervous. Now is nbd been coming here for years.  Super friendly staff, detailed oriented and they keep great track of notes from prior cuts.  Reasonable prices, not pushy on sales,  and a fun, relaxing atmosphere.  I would recommend.
5	As a perpetual haircut procrastinator, I'm always looking for a convenient place that's open late. I walked by the Great Clips Biltmore about 7:30pm, checked in online and by 8:15 had a great looking cut from Glen. I'm a fan!And all the stylists are great looking, too!
