5	After being tossed around in my office in the skies and being injured in severe turbulence , I find myself here. Not how I envisioned spending my winter but nonetheless anything to avoid spinal injections , (OUCH?) and/or surgery. I found this place a pleasant surprise in my new neighborhood,(I'm still missing my Biltmore area!). It's small and not overwhelming with too many clients. My PT therapist is thorough and very sweet. In other words, she doesn't put me in more pain! The office staff is friendly and never in a rush to shoo you out if you have questions. I'm also loving the fact that I get massages for therapy!
5	Amazing people to help with any rehab you need Eva and her team give each patient the attention and dedication they need
5	I want to acknowledge and thank PT Eva and her staff for providing me with the very best care and guidance.  Eva is a professional that really cares for your needs and wellbeing.  For many years I have suffered from L4, L5 and S1 disc hernia toons. Eva has provided me with relief from my pain and direction to a better life.  It works if you follow her plan.
