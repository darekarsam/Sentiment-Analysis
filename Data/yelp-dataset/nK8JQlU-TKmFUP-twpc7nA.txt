4	Yes, totally agree with Terry W.'s review. In addition they also have a great selection of Cobb loaves, rolls, breads etc that although not baked on the premises, are brought in fresh daily. A really convenient thing given Roseburn doesn't have a specialist bakery.
4	This small deli with a few seats to sit in with your coffee & salad roll is always clean and well presented. The fillings for your choice of roll etc are extensive and nothing is too much bother for the friendly staff.The quality of the coffee is high and many local business people call in for their takeaway breakfast or lunch.
