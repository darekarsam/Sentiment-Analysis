5	Just called this place and asked questions regarding units. Rosario is the guy that helped me. Answered all my questions and was very polite. Thanks!
5	The move from Los Angeles to Las Vegas could be stressful, especially when you have a bunch of stuff you're not willing to throw away, but Rosario was able to help out with some of it. He gave me and my fiance a lot of useful information regarding storage units available and pricing. Overall, a great guy! Will definitely be booking a storage unit through that man!
1	Tiffanie was rude and this place extorts people to buy  their locks and   subtly  threatens that "if you dont buy our locks and  something gets stolen its your fault."  My lock that was initially purchased  from this place  was cut off by public storage  and supposedly inventoried for auction. In the process of their so called inventory they damaged my couch and there are numerous items missing from the storage unit. Don't store your stuff here if you want to get it stolen from the staff
