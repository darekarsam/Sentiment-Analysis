5	Always finding little art project pieces. Even toys for the kids at times. Hit or miss for treasures. Love this place
1	Overpriced garbage. I rarely found anything worth buying and when I did I laughed out loud at the high prices. Once my son found a little toy on the floor (unpriced) and the rude clerk announced she would be charging me $1.49 for it as it came from the loose toys which are charged 10 for 1.49. Then she had the audacity to ask me to donate my change. I told her considering she just overcharged me for a piece of junk that I could have gotten at a yard sale for a dime that she'd gotten enough money out of me. She actually looked a little sheepish. At any rate, if you are looking for a bargain, don't bother. The selection sucks, the prices are high, and I'd say half the employees hate their job. The new Goodwill in Buckeye beats this place to oblivion.
