1	Yuck, yuck, yuck.  This pizza is not palatable.   We only ordered from there because of their aggressive coupon doorhanging campaign, and being recent transplants from Chicago, knew no better.  We sorely regretted the decision.   Anything would have been better than the pizza we received.  It's hard to screw up pizza, so the one star is awarded for accomplishing just that.   The pizza was laden with unevenly melted blobs of the worst mozzarella I've ever tasted, the sauce was bland, the crust lackluster, the toppings depressing.  No one should have to suffer this pizza.  I would advise them to shut down and stop desecrating the pizza world with this slop.
3	We ordered from Aprimo's because we had a coupon. We probably won't be ordering again. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. We ordered wings and a hoagie. However, it's not really the food that left us wanting more, it was the service. When we called to place the order, the employee seemed like he was in ten different places at once. Very spacey. After telling him what we wanted, he responded with "Okay. That'll be $25 and will be there in 40 minutes." He didn't even ask us how we were paying. Since we wanted to pay with a card, we called right back to give them the card information. The employee once again seemed like he had no clue what was going on and thought we were calling to add on to the order. He didn't understand we just needed to give the card information. It was pretty frustrating. If the food would have been out of this world I would have excused it, but it was really just average. 20 wings and a half hoagie was $25.
