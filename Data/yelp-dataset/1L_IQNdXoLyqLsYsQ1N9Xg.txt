4	this place is a hole in the wall type of place and can easily be missed if you are not looking for it. I stumbled here to get dinner on the way home for NYC. the line is long and seems popular as everyone gets food on the go since they have no tables to dine in. they dont consider themselves a restaurant but a grocery. the food is freshly prepared, the meats are nicely roasted. i ordered a slew of chicken, duck, pork , all roasted in various styles and spent about 50USD to feed 5 people. they dont usually have rice but if you ask they can create a rice box for you which i thought was nice of them. the roasted meats are all delicious and i will be sure to come back the next time i'm in montreal!
5	This is one of the best Chinese roast stuff places in North America I've been to.  That includes Chinatown NY, Flushing,  and places in Toronto. ROAST DUCK:  Great always.  Consistent.  Take home 1/2 or 1 whole duck for a quick dinner. ROAST CRISPY PORK:  Incredible when fresh.  Try to get the end near the neck and early in the day.  Use the nice sauce.  Eat quickly to get the crispiness of the skin.SWEET BARBECUE PORK (Char shu):  Very good.  Go for the lean if you prefer by pointing.  OTHERS:  Squid, duck wings, chicken.  Not interested.
5	This has by far been our best Chinese roast experience in Montreal. The staff were super friendly, and the different types presented are delectable. Most important of all, we found this gem in China town because of its alluring smell. I definitely will go back and highly recommend this place. A must-go for sure.
