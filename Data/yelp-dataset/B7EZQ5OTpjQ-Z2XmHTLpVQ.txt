5	Baskin Robbins is an odd thing to rate.  Anyway, they have a new icecream treat.  I don't really know if its new, but its called 31 below I think.  A cup of their soft serve with a topping.  I highly recommend heath bar.By they way, I just ate one, and I feel rather ill, but strangely satisfied.
4	Perhaps the last place in Charlotte to get my favorite flavor since childhood!  Daiquiri Ice!  Rocky Road is my second favorite.  This is I believe the only "full" (not mixed with d.d.) Baskin Robbins in Charlotte, which means twice the flavors of the ones with Donuts.
2	I've frequented this location a few times and have been disappointed each time from the cleanliness of the store to the lack of customer attention including being out of waffle cones 2 hours prior to closing. My thoughts would be for them to simply make more but no such luck. I've stood at the counter waiting to be helped and made eye contact with an employee a few times before he finally came help me. He was just standing there. Another time was told a price for donuts only to be rung up at a higher price because the employee was told by a teammate that he was wrong. I have it 2 stars because this location doesn't carry my favorite flavor ice cream but the ice cream I did have was decent.
