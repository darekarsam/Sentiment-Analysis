4	Great area to not be bothered and locations all over America so if you travel like myself it is very handy and always great workers at every location I attend! Little smaller and wish they had a sauna!
5	This quickly became my favorite Anytime location due to its spacious layout and awesome owners!I stopped by the other day after work, and the owner greeted me happily as he welcomed me to his gym. You can easily sense that he takes pride in meeting members and making this place feel like your second home. Everything is brand new here, as they have only been open for a few months. You can see that they did not spare any expenses since everything you need is in this gym...including a mediation room! They have 2 showers and 2 restrooms, along with plenty of storage space for your bags and a Sparklett water dispenser. They went with top of the line equipment, and everything is pristinely clean. Due to my rotating work schedule, I've been to the: Mesa, Chandler, North Scottsdale, Glendale,  and this location. I have to drive a bit out of my way just to go to this gym, but it's definitely worth it. Finally, a few pros v.s. other locations: barbell rack (missing in Mesa), numerous benches and space for free weights (lacking at Glendale and Chandler), brightly lit and no dead space (Glendale), TVs are actually on (Mesa).
5	Great spot for its cleanliness and decent equipment to get through any workout.  Not the type of gym that offers classes but perfect for the self motivated that want to workout in a non crowded gym.  Staff is friendly.  Take advantage of this new gym with new equipment!
