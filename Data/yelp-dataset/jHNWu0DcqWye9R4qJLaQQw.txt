1	Extremely unprofessional!!! Called, texted, and emailed about a property by Haven Homes. I received an email back from Chuck Grossman stating that he is available to assist me further. I called him @ 9am Monday morning to set up a time to view the property. We agreed on 12:30. Then I receive a call and a text message that "his boss" gave him a project and he couldn't meet me until 2. I completely understood and rearrange our schedule to meet him at the house at 2. I get to the house at 1:45 because I am always on time and the guy is already there, I thought to myself great, someone on time I am liking  this company. I knock on the door and nobody answers so we walk in. He is already there but with someone else ( hence the "project" his boss had him doing). He told us he was with someone else, so we waited outside. We waited outside for 20 minutes! Chuck finally comes outside and says "sorry". We said "sorry about what?" He replies "well the house has already been rented".     Now he could have handle the whole situation differently. He could have called or text me to let me know the home is no longer available. I would have thought nothing of it. But to have us drive all the way from Summerline to have my family wait outside for 20 minutes to tell us it is already rented is unacceptable. He had us waiting outside to see if this deal aka "boss project" was going to fall threw. If Chuck was just honest with me from minute one I would have never wrote this review.    If you are looking to rent from a company who is honest with integrity keep looking because this is not the one!
2	When you call it sounds and seems very professional. However, I was scheduled to look at a rental, decided to see the reviews on the company and read the previous Yelp review. Since it was pretty bad I called to confirm about the property. Of course my scheduled meeting with the leasing agent had been canceled, yet no one told me. The people on the phone are nice but the experience is negative since there seems to be broken communication internally.
1	I called Haven Homes because I was looking for a house with a pool and they said they had one available and made an appointment for me to view it at 2:00 that day. Ryan from Haven Homes called me and we confirmed our appointment and were scheduled to meet at 2:00. I arrived at the house 5 min till and waited for about 20 min.I called him, no answer. I waited another 15 min, texted and called him, no answer. At 2:45 I called Haven Homes told them what was going on and they said they would have someone get back to me. Ryan ended up calling me at 3:00 telling me he had just received my messages and texts and that someone was supposed to contact me earlier that day letting me know the house had been rented already. I understand mistakes happen and there are miscommunications but Ryan and Haven Homes should have taken the time to help me find another house instead of blowing me off. Horrible customer service!
1	Same situation. I called yesterday to schedule an appointment. I made sure to ask if the rental was definitely available and I was assured it was. I made the appointment. Called today to verify and there was no record of me making it (even though yesterday  I received an email from the company detailing the appointment!).  Leasing Agent's name I was given was Ryan and I am not sure he even works for them. The whole company is weird and I would not trust renting from them. Stay away if you're renting, their is something weird going on there.
1	Do not rent from Haven homes. they have the worse property management and customer service.they require you to use their pool service but I have a leak on the pump for 3 days now and the owner of the pool company haven't sent anyone to fix it.. its a crazy company managed by unprofessional incompetent people.I'm still trying to get a couple of problems taken care of in the house and we have been here for 2 months. Once they get your money you are on your own. they'll never answer or return your calls. Ryan is the worse realtor I've had to deal with.
1	DO NOT RENT FROM THESE THIEVES!! If I could post a zero for a review I would. We relocated from AZ so we sent our first month's and security deposit via certified mail due to the amount of money involved. Less than 2 weeks after move in we received a notice to vacate due to lack of payment. THE SAME PERSON THAT SIGNED FOR OUR CERTIFIED CHECK ALSO SIGNED THE NOTICE TO VACATE PAPER!! Of course he denied he did it. It gets better: after we moved out and received our release of security deposit approval letter for $1500 they never sent it to us. After at least 10 phone calls, excuses, being lied to-they told us they mailed not 1 but 2 refund checks to us but can't supply proof of the checks being cashed we have contacted the BBB, the Attorney General's office-who referred us to the Nevada Realtor Board, we're now taking them to small claims court. I'm done with these people and I don't care if it costs more to sue them than my refund deposit-it's now a matter of principle. STAY AWAY FROM HAVEN HOMES!!***Update 10/2014*** We did finally receive our security deposit back via several calls exchanged between my husband and district/regional supervisor Jorge. Apparently you need to contact corporate if you have any issues with Haven unless customer service has improved since we vacated our lease. Customer service has asked me to remove my review from Yelp. I told them I would be happy to update/edit my review not remove it. If you see a Haven property you love, enter at your own risk. As I stated, hopefully things have improved since our experience with them. Good luck!
1	Last week (Saturday) I contacted Haven Homes in regards to a home I saw that was for rent. It was out of our price range, but the young woman was helpful in finding another home nearby that met our criteria. She set up an appointment to view with Chris Gonzalez for Wednesday. From what I found on this house online it was ideal for my family. I called again on Monday to find out some information I forgot to ask about and spoke to Pedro. When he pulled up my info he claimed the wrong address was put down for us. That it was actually a house down the street. He them said an agent would contact me within 48 hours to set up a viewing time. I explained that we were in quite a time crunch and they have already had me down for a time, so he put a "note in" that someone needed to call me sooner. Well it's now been 5 days and nobody has called or emailed like promised. By far the worst customer service ever! Save yourself the headache and go to Colony American or Robinson Property management. They actually care and won't waste your time!
1	Haven homes has beautiful properties but when I decided on a property they told me it would take 72 hours to be approved or denied... That was a week ago I'm still waiting to hear something from them... I call everyday and they give me the same story "oh you should hear by the end of today" I wish I read all these reviews before working with these people because I already gave them my $500 deposit and if I back out now I'll lose that money... Hopefully things get better if I'm ever approved**update*** moved into one of there beautiful properties and maintenance sucks! I've have things that have needed to be fixed since I moved in on the 5the of September and it's now October 2nd and these issues still aren't fixed!!!! Don't work with this place please!
2	Who would have known that as a Las Vegas REALTOR, I would have had the worst professional experience in dealing with this company. Let me see,  I will keep this short and to the point.  As Real Estate Professionals, we work with all types of clients,  buyer, seller, and those who want rentals.  I took a client to one of their homes, did my part and got them a renter on the first day of the listing.  No problems there RIGHT?  I followed up with the listing agent and the office several times until my client was approved, at that point my job was done and I should be paid within 30 days ( By Law).  This was in June 2014.  I just got my compensation on the 15 of September........ after tons of back and forth phone calls, text, email, and even a visit to the office with my Broker.  I have never dealt with such an unprofessional company, rude agents, and office staff. They say all the right words, however, when it came to following up, YEAH NOT SOOOO MUCH!  As an agent, I will never say that I will not work with a certain company, but as least now I know what I am in for if my clients want to see one of there homes.  I hope that they tighten up the customer service for their clients and with the cooperating real estate agents who bring our clients to them.
1	So I guess now I have to start the legal process to get this company to fix the house I'm renting it's been over a month and problems just keep popping up! I warn you now don't work with these people no matter how nice the house is!
1	Update.... Moved in September 5th and still haven't had my issues fixed I'm getting every excuse in the world! And to top it all off my property manager won't even contact me back and know one seems to want to give me corporates number.... Pathetic
1	Seems to be a common theme here. I sure wish I would've researched Haven Homes before becoming locked into a 12 month lease with this company. I have had Several maintenance requests go ignored since moving in 3 months ago and had to threaten not to pay my $2300/month rent in order to get service the last time. I am now 5 days into my new request which is supposed to have a 48 hour turn around and I have heard Nothing. No big surprise there yet I am having to manually open and close my own garage door every time I arrive home or leave because it is not working for the 2nd time in 3 months. This company is a JOKE and it's an absolute Money PIT. If you value your time, money, or your sanity- do not rent from Haven Homes.
1	Worst place to rent a home Haven Homes is not a good property management.  I have had problems with a leaking shower have a hole in my ceiling in my kitchen My oven doesn't work I have called them it has been over a month and still nothing ridiculous.  I have worked in this type of business I will make sure other renters know about them before they rent from them.
3	First off, the home is lovely. I can look past the flat paint that is miserable to clean because they put in lovely colors and I understand, it's a rental. For $1695 a month I thought they could do a little better than that but my bad for not noticing in the first place. There is also brand new carpet and kitchen appliances (minus the fridge but that's okay, I have my own lovely new fridge) so the place does look very nice. According to the pool guy, a TON of work was put into this place as the last tenant had an, ahem, penchant for growing A LOT of weed. That being said, the two extra things we were looking for, if we could find them in a rental, were a pool with hot tub and a fireplace. We found one or the other in many houses but this one had both! Happy day!  Unfortunately, neither the hot tub or the fireplace work. We pay for the pool maintenance which we understood from the beginning but the condition of the pool and hot tub make me wonder if no maintenance is done if there are no tenants to pay for it.  There is a leak somewhere in the pool or hot tub, not sure which as it was my hubby talking to the pool guy, not me, and the heater panel on the hot tub heater needs to be replaced. So far no sign of that being done although the pool guy said he'd get back to fix everything at some point. Sincerely hoping "some point" isn't after my lease is up.The fireplace worked for less than a week after we moved in. The house has big lovely windows that let in a lot of light so we don't really need to heat most of the house. (Remind me to buy light/heart blocking curtains before summer. Yikes!) The one exception to that being the informal living room/family room in the back of the house. That area doesn't get a whole lot of sun so we were enjoying being able to just turn on the fireplace for a half hour or so to give the room some heat. Sadly this is no longer an option. We got through the convoluted process of setting up our online account to pay rent and make service requests with a little help from a very nice customer service representative. Setting up the rent payment was MUCH easier than making a service request. I'm sure that was just a coincidence. The request to fix the fireplace was made almost a month ago. So far we have heard nada, zero, nothing and bubkiss from Haven Homes. My husband has called but received stonewalling on the other end. His call was NOT returned by Haven. To sum it up, it feels like the management company is too big to worry about individual renters. The two things we really wanted for winter (and were a big part of the reason we rented the house) the fireplace and hot tub, don't work and frankly, there is no sign of them being fixed. A phone call with a timely schedule to fix the issues would be great but so far the response is zip. I've given them three stars because I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, having only been a tenant of theirs for not quite two months. So far though, I'd only rent from them if you're willing to fork out the cash/time to fix any issues yourself. I'll let you know how it goes. Too bad I saw these other review AFTER signing my lease. This definitely cements our plan to build our own home in the next year.
1	I to inquired about a home by haven and this was on the 17th. It's now the 27th and still no response or to the realtor. I moved from California to Vegas and now feel stuck. I already want to move back. These people don't seem to work at all return emails to my realtor. I in my life had never ran into such a poor experience on a rental.
