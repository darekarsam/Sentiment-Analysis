4	Dependable, clean and predictable.We went up to see kid #1 at college and this Hampton Inn didn't disappoint.  It's pretty new (I think ~ 1 year old) and delivered across the board.You can walk to Belmont Abbey, if you are so inclined, and it's right off the highway exit.
4	It's nice clean hotel with a very pleasant staff. The complientary breakfast is decent. The business center serves its purpose. The bathroom was decently sized for a multi night stay. The room was comfortable and well equiped though the bed was a tad soft for my taste. It's ideally situated if you have reason to be in Belmont, NC.
4	Standard Hampton Inn.  Clean rooms and comfortable beds.  Our room was away from the highway so noise was not an issue.  Eggs and sausage at breakfast as well as yogurt, cereal and pastries. We only stayed one night so can't add anything about the area.  Easy on/off to I85.
