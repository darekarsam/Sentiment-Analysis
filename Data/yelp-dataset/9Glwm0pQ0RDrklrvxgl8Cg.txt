1	I've never been wildly impressed but they get things done the same day if you drop it off in the morning so I've gone there for that reason. Until today. I noticed the shirt that I picked up last night didn't have the stains removed with a little preprinted tag that said they couldn't get the stains out from deodorant. However, there are spots from the dry cleaning fluid all over the back and a few on the front of the sleeveless sweater. I had this same shirt dry cleaned in Chicago with no problems.Other times I've gone I've had to take back dress pants because they don't have a crease. I've learned my lesson and will look for another cleaner!
1	I took in 6 garments, two pair of slacks, a silk polo and three dress shirts for dry cleaning.Firstly, way overpriced; each article is $3.50, even dress shirts. Unfortunately, I was in a pinch for time and went with Concord anyway.Secondly, two of the dress shirts came back with large ink stains on them. The other dress shirt is covered with lint.Thirdly, the silk polo came back with a large snag.Finally, the slacks are wrinkled.I am not sure how this company stays in business.
3	i have mixed feelings about this place. the "good" are the u-of-i staff/student discount days (wednesdays, i think). the "bad" are the generally negative attitude of the people who work there (we call them "the dry cleaning nazis") and the fact that i've been finding yellow stains on some of my clothes after getting them back.
1	Absolutely the worst dry cleaner I have ever been to. Every time I go in there I get hassled about something. Their services are overpriced, as are all dry cleaners in this town ( it cost me $6.50 per suit when I lived in Chicago, where I typically think of everything being overpriced). However, at Concord, you over pay and then you can't tell if they've even cleaned your clothes. I leave there frustrated every. single. time. Go to Colony Square where the staff is friendly, intelligent, and good at what they do.
