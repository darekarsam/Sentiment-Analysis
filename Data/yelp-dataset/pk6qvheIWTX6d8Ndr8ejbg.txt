5	The guy was super helpful while advising me on the best way to ship my envelope. He thoroughly explained all of my options, and since this was an important letter, I really appreciated that.I also got a few documents notarized. No complaints. It was quick and easy. I'll remember this store when I have something else to ship.
2	"Meh. I've experienced better." sums it up just right. Forgive me for being an economics major, but I firmly believe that prices should reflect the cost of production. If I need to print a black and white two page document, it should cost 20 or so cents, no matter what the CONTENT of the two pages are. I should not have to pay 10 times this amount just because *what* I need to print is a packaging slip. I raised a question about this while I was in the store, but the guy gave me a condescending speech about how they are a for-profit business, so I just paid quickly to get out of there. $2 is no skin off my nose, but it's the principle of the matter!
