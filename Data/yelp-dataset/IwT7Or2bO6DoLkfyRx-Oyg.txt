4	Having just moved from Seattle to Glendale AZ 4 months ago, I needed to find someone who cleaned carpets. I asked a few people who are locals to the area.I had Leo's Carpet Cleaning  out to my home after seeing reviews of others on Facebook who have used Leo's Carpet Cleaning. I emailed Leo on Monday and got quote by phone. Leo charges by size of home. I'm in a single story home and given a quote of $125. Two Story is $225. I scheduled an appoint for Thursday (today) . Leo showed up on time ( which I appreciate since I work from home). He did not rush the job, in fact he was here 2 hours. Leo really cares about his work and it showed in his hard work. Leo has a helper who is also great and just as attentive as Leo to detail.A  great job, my carpet are off white and left in great shape. I couldn't be any more happier! I will call on this company for regular service from here on.
5	I have had Leo clean my carpets twice now and both times he did an excellent job.  Shows up on time and works hard!  The carpets looked new and smelled fresh!  He has two prices...single story and two story (which includes steps) and the price can't be beat!
5	They did an excellent job, they were here on time and very professional. They took their time and delivered a high quality result. I was impressed with their state of the art equipment, very high tech very impressive. I will be using them for future cleanings.
