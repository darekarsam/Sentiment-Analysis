4	I liked this place and would certainly return if I was from around here. They were friendly, there was ample seating for waiting, a a healthy supply of magazines (though I didn't have to wait.)The haircut? It was good. She used a combo of clippers and scissors, and she took her time. When done, the all important shaving of the neck with a straight edge razor proved they are for real. So did trimming eyebrows and ear hair.All at a fair price, too.

He has been to Cave Creek Barber Shop three times and has received a consistently good haircut from Dave. The price is reasonable ($17) and the wait is always minimal. They shave the neckline - my husband says this is a must for a barber shop. No frills barber shop (but that is his preference) that offers good, friendly service.

A hearty welcome, relaxed atmosphere, and honest cut are what you'll find at this down to earth barber shop in Cave Creek.  Only drawback for me was the dog presence was a little too much, as the entire place smelled more like a dog than a barbershop, which is hard to do especially in a barbershop where quite a few scented products of the trade are used regularly.
