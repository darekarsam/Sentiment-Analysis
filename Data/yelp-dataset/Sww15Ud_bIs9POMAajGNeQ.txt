1	Dont use this company. Scammers! Matt quoted my hotel a price of 16 to Scottsdale and then the driver clipped me for $20. Its apparently their practice to overcharge customers. If you dont want to get ripped off, use another limo or taxi company.Dishonest company.
4	A friend of mine in Vancouver recommended Matt's company and I used them 4 times while I was in Phoenix. These guys are half the price and I paid 20$ for a ride that another company would charge me 40$. As well, knowing that I was staying closer to where their office was located, Matt gave me a ride for free to Biltmore Fashion Park and back to the hotel after my shopping tour. English is not Matt's first language and  I simply suggest talking to him beforehand to make sure he (or his drivers) charge what he quoted. Cars on all occasions were comfortable and clean.
1	This company ( First Class sedan) definitely is a scam. On phone Matt gave price of $25 with specific addresses and The driver Richard charged my girlfriend $40! Dishonest company. Go elsewhere.
