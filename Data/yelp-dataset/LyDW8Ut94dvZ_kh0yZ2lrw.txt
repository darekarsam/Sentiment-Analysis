3	I ate lunch at this restaurant yesterday and was surprised how nice it was inside.  I expected more of a chain-looking type place.The food was pretty good, although it's tough to find something that stands out when you just order pizza...as far as the pizza's go though, right up there with the best of 'em for those flat stone oven type pizza.Service was good as well.  I would go for lunch again, or take clients, but probably not go personally as there are many other choices that are more unique.
5	Had lunch here today. The restaurant looks expensive from the outside, so I was pleasantly surprised at how affordable it is. I had a vitello Roma from the lunch menu which included a Cesar salad. The salad was a good, typical Cesar for an Italian restaurant. The veal was outstanding. The sauce was perfect and the peppers and mushrooms added a lot of flavor. I had it with fettuccine which was cooked perfectly. I'm glad I finally gave this place a chance.
2	Went there for a group of friends to celebrate a birthday and it was ok but nothing memorable. The place is huge and it was quite busy so it was very loud because they had a live group playing at your table. The service was very slow and the waitress came many time to apologies and explain that the kitchen was backed up.The menu is big but nothing really stood out to me. So I ordered pasta and mussel and it was good but again not amazing.I would maybe go there again if I am in the area but wouldn't go out of my way just to go there.
3	Hanging with friends here to avoid traffic.Service is good. Xmas decorations cute. Environment is good for having a discussion. Soup really too salty, they changed it to another type of soup for me :)
