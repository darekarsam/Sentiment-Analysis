5	I have been coming to the Carrick Cost Cutters for several years and have had Valerie cut and color my hair all those years.  She is professional and talented.  I get what I need and am very pleased with my styles.  My husband uses this salon but he does not limit himself to any one stylist and he is pleased as well.
1	The customer service is absolutely horrible. They made me wait an hour before anybody got to me, and there were 3 available beauticians in the back. I complained and got waited on right away. I thought the customer always came first. Why would they want to risk a customer not coming back. I mean I can just go down the road to Borics. These women are old middle aged miserable employees with no passion for their jobs. I won't be back. DISAPPOINTED...:(
