4	I was out on errands today when suddenly I came upon this Church's, so of course I slammed on the brakes & whipped in here!     :-))The bathroom was clean & provided paper towels to wash up for lunch & get out with your hands clean.Having one of their often-mailed coupons on hand, I ordered a Two-Piece Meal, which produced a (Spicy) chicken leg, a big thigh, a cup of mashed potatoes & gravy, & a biscuit plus spread.  The staff was friendly, the dining room comfortable, the food delicious, & it was a pleasure to eat here today where everything was right!2-Piece Leg & Thigh Lunch Special:  $1.99!
4	Overall good service when I come here!!   Food was hot & good!!    I would come again & recommend to a friend :-) I ordered the 2 piece mixed special for $2.99.
1	Worst experience ever. I have been sitting in the front of the restaraunt for 20 minutes waiting for our order.
