5	This place is wonderful. Im so happy i took my kids here, as long as we are still in vegas this will be the place for all my kids dental needs.  Kinda hard to find at first, i passed it twice (even with the gps) but the receptionist stayed on the phone with me guiding me until i got there.  Once there my kids got seen very quickly.  Dr. Manni and the rest of the girls there are very friendly they talked to my kids and I while doing the exams and cleanings. Loved how they keep the kids distracted by getting to know them and before they knew it they were done. So glad they decided to expand their clinic to the vegas area.
5	If you are in need of a kind, gentle, kid friendly dentist.....look no further, Dr. Manny is THE BEST in town, hands down.  After several horrible visits to absolute dental, finding Dr. Manny was a life saver for my little girls dental needs.  He is patient and responsive to young children's needs when it comes to dentistry.  So thankful that I can now bring my son to Dr. Manny as well since he is the only way to go when it comes to my babies dental care! Thanks Dr. Manny for being amazing!!
4	Overall good service. They were really nice and helpful to my two little girls (2&3). However there is only 2 dentist that works there so after the tech cleaned my daughters teeth we waited a good while for dr.manni to see us.
