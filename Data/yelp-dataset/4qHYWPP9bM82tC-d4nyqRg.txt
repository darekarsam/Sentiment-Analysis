5	We are new to the area. We bought a 100 year old home in the Dormont suburb of Pittsburgh and set about to do a serious renovation. The moment we walked into Ceramiche we knew we were in good hands. Tina, Bob, Melissa, Suzy and Nicky all know their stuff and treat us like long lost friends. The selection of tile is the best we have found in this area and the prices are very good. The service is what really makes this place special.
5	My contractor has a relationship with Best Tile, so we went there first thing in the morning.  We were the only people in the entire store, and yet no one greeted us, offered to help us or  even acknowledged that we were in the store.  When we finally asked for help, the two women who were at the front desk seemed to be inconvenienced by our request.  I decided to check out Ceramiche after hearing rave reviews from my hairdresser.  First, the selection was amazing!  Second, I had assistance from 3 people without even asking, and finally, the prices were comparable to what I had chosen at Best Tile. A no-brainer who will be getting my business!
