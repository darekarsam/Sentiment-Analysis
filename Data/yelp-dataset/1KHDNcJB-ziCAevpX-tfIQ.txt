5	Great library! Can't ask for more than a few books and helpful staff,
5	great place! Wonderful staff
2	The computers are hogged by 10 year olds playing video games and refugees the united way placed in the area. The tables are hogged by the seniors and other people who obviously don't work. This is only a good library if you don't know how good some of the others are.
2	The library itself is warm and welcoming, the staff is attentive. However, there are kids EVERYWHERE and apparently the idea that libraries are quiet, tranquil spaces is a dead one here. It was CRAZY noisy and the staff didn't seem to even notice. I don't know how anybody could come here to read or study, it was basically a playground. I much prefer the Downtown or West End locations, where people know how to act in a library. I have no problem with children at all and I realize not every family can afford a computer so of course the kids are attracted to libraries these days. But whatever happened to kids being taught that there is a time and a place for loud and rambunctious behaviour? I'll be sticking to the locations where I can hear myself think.
