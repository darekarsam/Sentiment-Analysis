5	Cute park. Covered playground with sand. Bathrooms. Basketball and volleyball courts. Covered picnic benches. Baseball fields. This park is fairly large with a couple different parking lots. I guess there is a dog park area somewhere but I didn't see it.
5	5 Stars for a covered playground!! LOL... sheesh so glad I found this park. My girls got to play in the shade and they had a blast! Bathrooms were near by so we didn't have to hike to one. There were picnic tables all around and trees surrounded the play area for a nice breeze!This park is also a dog park but that area is completely fenced off just for dogs, which is awesome because I hate seeing a bunch of dog boo boo where my kids play. Looks like a good place to have a birthday party as well, plenty of parking so no worries for guests. Will take my girls here again soon!
5	Really fun, huge, shaded playground area with a large variety of playground equipment. Many nice ramadas, benches, and huge grassy areas.
