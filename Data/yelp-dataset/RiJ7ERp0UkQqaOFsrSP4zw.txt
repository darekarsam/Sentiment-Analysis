5	I went to Arizona Authentic Pizza not expecting much, yet I was impressed by the food.  For the price they get 5 stars the crust was just the perfect amount for the toppings not too thick not too thin.  The 4.99 pepperoni special is the best deal in town.  I drive out of the way to eat here, it is clean the staff is great the place is small yet I enjoy eating there.  They guys there will make any pizza any way you want it yes they bake it when you order it and believe me there is nothing like a hot pizza that does not taste like cardboard like Little Caesars.  Support the little guy and try it I assure you it is great.  Have tried the other pizzas on the menu and also find them quite good.
4	Loved it because its very inexpensive and i definitely recommend stopping by if your in the area!!  I would also recommend calling ahead of time unless you can wait 15 min :) totally worth 5 bucks!
4	I used to work right by this place but rarely stopped in. However, if you're the type to see "$5 pizza" and jump right in, you're not going to get much better. It's on par with most chain places and beats the pants off of other bargain basement places like Little Ceasar's or Pizza Patron. Granted, there's a Domino's right up the street that can give you more for a couple more bucks, but this place hits the pizza spot for sure, and does it at a price you can't touch. The breadsticks were surprisingly good, as well.
