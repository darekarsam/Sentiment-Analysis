1	The store is pretty small but the location is easy to find. I'm giving this location 3 out of 5 stars because of the rude customer service I have gotten from a certain employee. She was being extremely rude to me, shaking her head at me and threw the tape measure on the ground because she got mad. Extremely rude and unprofessional to do in front of a customer. I suggest to teach your employees what great customer service means because some of them think they can act however they want in front of a customer. Because of that act PostNet has lost my service and I will not be returning back here.
1	Waste of money and time. I understand a surcharge for convenience... But a 200% markup is ridiculous. Owner is rude too.
4	Not sure why the other reviewers complained about rude service because I have held a mailbox here for over a year now and they have always taken care of my needs. Would recommend them to anyone.
