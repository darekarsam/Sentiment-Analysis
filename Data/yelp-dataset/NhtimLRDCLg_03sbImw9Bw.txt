5	Susan is absolutely the best!  I went to Susan after a long search for a new stylist and am so pleased with my choice.  Susan is fantastic with cuts and color, I wanted to make a change from long to short and could not be happier with the result.  I have had nothing but compliments on my hair.  Susan is charming, knowledgeable and is easy to talk to.  Overall, my experience could not have been better.  I will continue to go to Susan in the future.
5	Susan did an awesome job with my balayange highlights. She listened to what I wanted and executed the color and style perfectly. My experience at the studio was extremely pleasant- I was immediately comfortable with Susan and her abilities. I would recommend Susan to anyone. She was accommodating with my schedule and followed up to ensure I was happy with her services. Great experience.
