5	Love my agent Lisa!! Its great to have someone so nice as an insurance agent! I would recommend her to anyone who needs insurance!
5	Lisa McLaughlin was most helpful to my husband and I when we came to her with our insurance needs. I feel she went above and beyond to make it happen. She is very knowledgeable and comfortable to be around. Thanks, Lisa for all your help.
5	I was very impressed with the customer service I recieved at Farmers Insurance ran by Lisa McLaughlin and especially by Marissa. I will definitely be a life long customer and have recommended them to family and friends.
