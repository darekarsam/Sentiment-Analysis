5	This place is actually really great!At first when I drove past I didn't fully understand what exactly a "fitness cafe" was then I saw a groupon for Fix8 and I bought it so I could test it out.Well worth it!  Entire portioned out meal for $14! and HEALTHY, I have been looking for a place like this.Garlic steak is a must try, I will return!
1	I was so excited to go to this place as I was looking for a meal prep service.  However, the place is closed!!
5	This place is absolutely delicious if I could afford to eat it everyday I would.
3	If it were open the last 2x I've been id give it 5 stars but since they choose when they feel like opening I'll give them 3 stars
