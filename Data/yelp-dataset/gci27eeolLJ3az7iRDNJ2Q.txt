5	DAD'S BAIL BONDS assisted me with a very close friend that got caught up after having a few cocktails. This was a new experience for us, but the friendly staff at Dad's Bail Bonds walked me through every step of the way.  I was even a bit short on funds for what they quoted me, but offered an easy payment plan (with no interest charges). I'm very thankful to everyone at Dad's Bail Bonds for taking care of our needs in such a professional & timely manner.Even got a free T-shirt & a really nice pen!  Deb Y.
