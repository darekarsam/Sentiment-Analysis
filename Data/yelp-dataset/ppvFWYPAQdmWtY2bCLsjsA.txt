5	Renting the paddle boards was super easy. Heather was very helpful. She explained everything we would need. We drove out to  Saguaro lake for the day. I recommend going early cause the lake gets super busy.  Bring water, sunscreen and some snacks:)
5	This was great! No Snow owners made it easy to pick up boards, gave safety lessons, and even let's us borrow sunglass holders. Totally doing it again!
5	My husband and I rented boards from no snow this morning, and let's just say I am already planning when I can go back!! It was a great experience from beginning to end. I loved that it was a hassle-free, quick rental process, and the folks at no snow were so nice.
5	Its a brand new shop in the east valley that is catering to and developing the Stand Up Paddleboard community. they have been nothing but excellent in there service and hospitality. This shop is gonna make a name for SUP  in Phoenix.
5	I bought a couple paddles to use when I surf in CA. I was surprised that NoSnow could get them for the same price as most online websites. They custom fit mine for me right there in the shop. The best part was that after I used my paddle for a couple days I wanted it a little shorter. I took it back to the shop and they cut it down and re-epoxied the handle for me in a couple minutes. I also rented a couple boards for the day to float down the Salt River with my two young boys. They fit us with great boards and made sure we had all the right tie downs. We had a great time and the guy at NoSnow really seemed to care about our experience. This is a great local shop.
