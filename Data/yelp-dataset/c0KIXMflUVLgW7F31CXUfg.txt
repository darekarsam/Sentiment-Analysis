5	I LOVE THE SUSHIS HERE!!! No seriously if I dont feel like spending tonnes of money at my other go to Zenya or moderate level Kanda/Tokyo You will most likely find me here where theyre yummy dragon eyes have a combo with miso soup. My usual order from here is avocado with crispy rolls without cucumbers. Love the crispy/spongy texture and Lam one of the employees just always makes it right for me. I am telling you folks take my word next time youre craving sushi and walking through the underground tunnel from McGill to Bonaventure make a stop here and skip other local Sushi expresseses
2	meh fast food sushi place located in a commercial center.the place is convenient when i used to work downtown and had some sushi craving for lunch so i just stop by this shop and grab one of their already made sushi box and off i'd go back to work or eat them as bite while i window shop a little.i never looked and order from their menu as why would one bother when there's a damn lineup and you only have an hour break?the staff is lovely and that's pretty much it.i mean, when you don't have time to look for a better place or you're too lazy or you don't know what to eat, you go to the first place that pops in your mind, this place is the one!
