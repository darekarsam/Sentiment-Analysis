4	I like this CVS. It's big, clean and everyone is very friendly. Watch out for oldies!
4	Like this CVS, located conveniently off of Bell Rd. in Sun City.This store is large, roomy and usually. It overly packed. They receive some good cosmetics at this location and the staff are very friendly.They have a nice parking lot with enough parking to keep you close to the door.Also conveniently located in the same lot as Safeway and several other stores.
