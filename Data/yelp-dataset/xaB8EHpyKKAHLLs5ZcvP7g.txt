1	why by a mac when you can by food cheap elswhere that keeps you full for longer and doesn't support a multi national.try a local cafe,you might be surprised and find something different.
3	Usually drive through the drive through and they always get something wrong no matter what! Everytime and have had quite a few bad meals from this McDonald's but despite that, the staff are all really nice and friendly and make you fell welcome. They are also very child friendly.
