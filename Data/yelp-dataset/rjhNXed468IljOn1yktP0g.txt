4	awesome place.So intimate.And such good food.I still think about their Lobsert BLT - lobster on a brioche with cricular bacon and a freshly cut tomato salsa type thing. Basically, the chef cooks behind a bar. You watch, you love him and he yells at you. The day i went, he just finished cooking a pork shoulder for 1/2 a day in the oven. When it come out, he came over to have us try it. It was amazing. When i ordered a steak, he told me i was an asshole (jokingly).Great place, and the duo owners do a good job pleasing their clientelle.Thankful my friend introduced me to this place.
4	Harry and  Nick own and run the perfect neighborhood restaurant!!!It's an intimate and cozy space with amazing food using the freshest ingredients.  Dinner for eight last night  consisted of family style Greek salad with chopped grilled octopus, beef and salmon tartars, fried calamari, lamb chop on top of mushroom risotto.  Plus dessert!!!  The only problem about this place is that it's not a walking distance from where I live.
