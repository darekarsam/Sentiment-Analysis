2	I had difficulty making a deposit, at the counter, of 1 check this afternoon.  The Teller had difficulty understanding that I wanted to deposit the check into the same business account as the name that was printed on the check.  It took several minutes to try to make this clear.  This is the first time I came into this particular branch and I was not impressed.
5	Easy deposit and friendly staffs. See Rauh Garcia if you need any help, he is a nice guy and will help you with any problem.
2	This Wells Fargo is right behind my house, but never seems to fail me with their drive thru ATM! It's always down or cash is unavailable! It's a huge inconvenience! Why offer a drive up ATM if it's never working for cash!!! This needs to be fixed!
