4	Came in here on a Saturday night (1/21/12).  Customer service was great!  My husband and I were in there for over a half hour and even though the traffic was slow that night the 2 salesperson on duty that night were very personable!!! They didn't appear fake nor were they hustling! LOL  I made only 2 small purchases but would gladly come back here again! (very different from the Sanrio store we had just left where the super fem & bitchy staff were gossiping about other staff & making their Saturday night plans).
4	I love Fossil for their watches. I love Fossil for their bags. I love Fossil for their wallets. I have even started to love Fossil for items I didn't know they made.For a long time, I had no idea that they made clothes. A few times into their actual store and I find that I like their denim and chambray shirts. When they do discounts, the price is not bad. Scavenging through the clearance is a must because there tends to be some hidden gems within the organized racks. Back to their accessories. The quality of their product is impeccable. I have moved pass their watches, but the design of their bags and wallets are my new obsession. I am normally not hung up on leather goods, but the soft and distressed leather items are gorgeous. I just wait for their 40% off sales because they are not cheap. The staff are always personable and readily available. There are so many of them and a quick lap has you running into four or five friendly faces.
5	nice store. :) they make michael korrs watches too
5	I came here because of a problem with a piece of jewelry and they replaced it, no questions asked. They have the best warranty policy, just save your receipt!  This store is always clean and the employees were very helpful finding me the right gift while i was here. They gave great advice and were extremely helpful. Ruth was the associate who helped me.
