5	I've been a client of Tiffany's for many years.  Her new location has that awesome new building smell.  The room is tastefully decorated.  Tiffany offers a wide variety of spa services.  I love the way she tints and shapes my eyebrows and her waxing services last several weeks.  She also offers cupping and Thai massage which I have done almost every week.  Tiffany's prices are reasonable and she never makes me feel like she is rushing through the appointment.  Sometimes I get so relaxed that I fall asleep.
5	Tiffany is wonderful!! I have been a loyal client for years and have left happy and relaxed each time I visit. She takes the time to listen to what I want and she always delivers! I would be very sad if she ever left the metro area.
5	Tiffany is awesome!...she runs a soothing and productive salon, her facials and hair removal techniques are excellent and her wonderful demeanor will put you at ease...I highly recommend Tiffany and Skin Ritual for your beauty needs
