3	nice hotel with a great restaurant.  rooms are clean and seem fairly new.  One of the better holiday inns ive stayed in for sure.
4	The rooms in this hotel are clean and comfortable. Fitness center is very nice and the staff is friendly and helpful. The only issues I had was trying to coordinate an airport van time. When I called to try a get a different van time I continually got placed on hold so I eventually went down to the front desk in person to coordinate a new time. Ironically by the time this run around was complete it was time to get on the van to go to the airport. Luckily it all worked out. The location of the hotel doesn't have that much stuff nearby unless you are willing to walk a short distance to the mall.
