4	the atmosphere is awesome, very cosy.. the food is nothing fancy but always satisfying, it's everything a dinner is supposed to be AND OPEN 24 H!!!!!
3	Best place for breakfast all day and night.
3	Ordered delivery from there tonight. Good, tasty, a ton of fries (more than I can eat but my roommate is going to be a happy man because of it) and well cooked chicken. My only complaint, which is a fairly big one, is that I ordered mozzarella sticks for 6,95 and they arrived cold, hard and were somehow accompanied with a piece of banana, cantaloupe, and orange. Having mozzarella sticks that taste like orange was not enjoyable whatsoever and just really bizarre. I wouldn't have ordered them had I known.Quick delivery, the guy was really nice.
3	Standard greasy spoon. Some discounts if you sign up online for their newsletter and on your birthday. I ate there for breakfast, which was tasty.Upside is that it's open 24 hours and serves breakfast all day. There is also a terrace in the summer, but people usually smoke. The inside of the restaurant looks like a scene taken from the 1970s, once brightly coloured but now faded.
