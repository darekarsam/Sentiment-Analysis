4	Steak Frites at IDS is the place where I like to satisfy my filet mignon cravings. The reality is I haven't been to any other location of this restaurant chain as to compare, but the meat quality here is good.While visiting it is worth trying the steak frites and the small filets St Paul, the filet mignon is yet the best for my taste. The Steak Frites menu also offers the same food in tapas size and the selection is really nice, you can pick at least an appetizer if you are here for the steak. I personally always go with the snail choices of this restaurant, both the garlic and cheese versions are delicious. Keep your warm bread and dip into the snail butter, just be careful there are main course and all you can eat french fries coming. And if you still can afford it order the mi-cuit au chocolat for desert (sorry the English translation of this mouthwatering warm dark chocolate goodness is not elegant enough to describe it).The best of the Steak Frites concept is the BYOB, what better then eating quality steak with high quality wine of your choice without spending a fortune. Location, food and good service makes of this restaurant a nice dinner option for the residents of Verdun.
