5	My fiance and I met Eric at the Mesa Arts Center for an engagement photography session. He was very flexible with the scheduling and was able to accommodate our work schedule to arrange the shoot.Upon meeting, we discussed what we were looking for and Eric had many different ideas for good shots. He was great to work with, and we ended up spending over an hour taking many different photos.The photographs turned out fantastic, and we could not have been happier. We can't wait to have Eric shoot our wedding in a few months. Thanks again!
4	My husband and I had tried doing a studio shoot for our family, and our dramatic young child had other ideas.  I decided that maybe a location shoot would work better.  I contacted Eric to negotiate arrangements. Between my husbands work schedule and mine, we were somewhat limited in what we could do, and we were hoping to get the pictures done in time for the holidays (December 2011).  Eric worked with us to come up with a date/time that worked.  We decided to meet at the Tempe Center for the Arts.  I had given Eric a quick idea on what we wanted (ie family group picture in a natural environment).  When we met, our two year old wanted nothing doing with "posed" images.  Eric was very flexible, and we started doing active shots.  As an additional surprise, we also brought along our dog, and he was able to incorporate her into some of the shots.  He was great to work with, and we ended up spending over an hour taking many different photos.  We had a lot great photos to choose from, and it took us a while to narrow it down to favorites.  We also got them in time to do a holiday newsletter and include pictures.Thanks again!
