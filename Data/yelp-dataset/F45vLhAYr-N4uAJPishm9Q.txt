5	100% the best pizza I have ever had. They have a huge variety of toppings and every pizza I have had was made to perfection. Highly recommended !
5	This is my favourite take out pizza in KW! Great gourmet-style pizza. My favourite is the Momma Mia. I haven't found some one yet who doesn't like that pizza...even skeptics who think it's not their type!
5	First time ordering from Pizza Prosciutto. Great service, prompt delivery. Amazing pizza and wings. Highly recommend this delicious pizza restaurant!
