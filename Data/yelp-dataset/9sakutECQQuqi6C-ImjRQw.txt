4	Wells Fargo is the best bank in this country.  This is not my favorite location but if I just need to get cash quick, the location is quite convenient.  For foreign currency exchange and other services, go somewhere else.
1	This place is the worse wells Fargo I have ever been to. I will never come back to this location. To start with they told us our wait time would be 15 minutes that was an hour ago and the only reason were next is because everyone before us has walked out the door. Then some most underdressed girls walk in and get helped right away for "business". Then the banker tried to send us away. To come back later. This is the last time I will be here.
1	They only care about people who have checking and savings accounts. I guess having just a credit card with them isn't enough. Use to bank with them until they closed one of my debit cards and never sent me a new one. They tried to tell me I wouldn't be able to get a temporary card and asked if I could live without it til the new card came in in 7-10 business days. That was the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard in my life, so that was why I closed my checking and saving accounts right then and there. Went in today to have something notarized (since I had my credit card with them still), but just got turned away because I didn't have a real account with them. I guess having just a credit account with them isn't enough. I couldn't believe that they turned me away. The least that they could've done was charge me for it like every other bank, but no, the girl had asked the GM and came back to me saying she couldn't do anything for me. I've come here previously when I still had my account to get another document notarized and they were very pleasant. This time around was the last straw I had with Wells Fargo. I am cutting up my credit card and never going back to them again. I've always had problem after problem ever since I opened my accounts in 2010. They will not be getting a dime from me ever again.
