4	Went to ChickFilA for the very first time and got the chicken tenders and comes with waffle fries!! Very tasty for fast food! Also had great customer service and the inside was very clean!!
2	Most Chick-Fil-A's get 5 stars. This one gets 2, deducted one star for each time my order has been wrong in the last 3 visits. First, order a sandwich and nuggets, got a sandwich and fries. Next time, ordered two spicy sandwiches, got two regular ones, also asked for mayo, got 1 packet, um.... Tonight, ordered 1 spicy, 1 regular, was told I had to pull aside and wait for the spicy (no big deal), I said "No problem, just please remember the mayo". They brought the order to me, I quickly checked to see if it wasz there (no mayo), I look up, she's gone (gee, thanks, I waited for you). Love this place, wax excited to get one on my route home, but Im not coming back to this one. Terrible management when you cant get your product out correctly.
5	This location is run well. Employees are always kind and courteous and the one time we had to wait in line they handed us a coupon for a free chicken sandwich. They have never gotten our order wrong and the restaurant is clean. Food is always hot and they stick to chickfila standards for food quality and fast friendly service. This morning we were in line waiting to order we have never ordered breakfast close to 10:30am lunch switch so we called from the line to ask if we could order breakfast before they stopped serving breakfast. They had absolutely no problem and we're kind and courteous over the phone. Good job management and thank you to all the employees. We love the car who comes to the drive through if you have kids every so often :) while chickfila is a tad pricier than other fast food the quality of the food and service are well worth it. This is one of our favorite places to stop if we are in a rush. Thank you!
