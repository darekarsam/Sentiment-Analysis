4	The post office on Albemarle Road is the closest to my house - and the staff here has always been very friendly.  They added an automatic vending machine (for postage and stamps) not too long ago, which can be accessed even when the desk is closed, which is nice, because I don't often use the desk for much other than mailing standard packages or getting stamps.The only downside to this location is a common problem in Charlotte - the parking lot.  They have an entrance where people aren't supposed to exit, but they do.  Visitors exiting are supposed to go all the way to the end (by the mailboxes), and then exit, but people try to come out the entrance, which is downright dangerous.  Keep your eyes open.
3	Like any other business, there are good post offices and there are bad ones. This one is better than most. Decent parking, lots of boxes and unlike some, a vending machine with a scale that lets you get the right postage for your package and even buy stamps without having to go interact with one of the counter agents. It's also available when the counter area is closed.Since I had some time on my hands (waiting on my car to be tinted, across the street), I opted to deal with a human to pick up a couple of stamps. He was pleasant and helpful and go 'er done quickly.
3	mehhh... its a post office. Now in the day and age where PPL interactions are less and less. I havn't really found a need to have any. Everything i've needed I got w/o speaking to anyone. (anti-social.. I mean.. this is the POST OFFICE after all.. no "going postal on me")But if your old fashion say.. (1990's..lol).. you can walk to the desk (after standing in line) and speak to anyone there. They are friendly and "happy" to help.. WINK
