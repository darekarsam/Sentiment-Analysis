1	If you like a great Pho then this is definitively not the place for you. They pretentiously say "Fine Cuisine Asiatique", this is not so.
5	I loved this place. Amazingly flavorful...the curry and coconut milk dishes, as well as the ones with peanut sauce. Our server was friendly and helpful.
1	cheap food.... even to expensive for what you pay. the food is not cook when u order it. they warm it up in the microwave!!! our dishes were barely warm. Our combo was supposed to have a dessert included and we had to ask for it 3 times. They were saying there was no dessert but then it was written on the bill. poor service, pour location pour food. I would not recommend this restaurant.
4	Great ambiance! I was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of decor and some of it matching quite well with the tables and chairs. This place was recommended to me by another Yelp reviewer for especially large group reservations. I agree with her. They did a fine job with keeping reservations and making sure that the tables were prepared with menus, cutlery, and glasses of water before any of us arrived. You can come here with as many people, up to 20, and they'll be able to find a way to seat all of you together. I loved the combo I ordered! Hot and sour soup was quite special. The curry and coconut milk and chicken were amazing! And last but not least, the fried banana was the perfect finale. What I had to tick off one star for was that if they're going to offer combos, all the combos should come with the relatively same stuff. Some of our combos came with soup and dessert, sure. But for a couple of our group, they got more: an imperial roll and salad. And these specific additions were not stated clear enough in the menu. And though I was happy with my dessert, tea or coffee wasn't included as it was for another couple of our group. Nevertheless, I would love to come here again soon.
