5	This is definitely the best Chinese food I've had in Pittsburgh.  I ate here with my family recently... the Beijing Duck was probably some of the best I've ever had anywhere, and my brother said that it was actually better than the Beijing duck he had during his 2 years living in China.  The Won Ton soup, the Moo Shu Beef, Kung Pao Chicken, and vegetable dishes were also very tasty.  None of the food had MSG in it and all the ingredients were very fresh.  One of the owners told us that the chef had worked in New York City for 10 years before coming to Pittsburgh.  I think his experience shows pretty well.  They also told me that they had just remodeled the whole place including a new kitchen.  I definitely recommend making the trip or ordering for delivery.
5	Just like the other reviewers, this is one of the best places for Chinese food in Pittsburgh. Only one place in greentree tops it in my mind. They have eat in and takeout. If you are in the mood for Chinese in the south hills this is the place to get it at!
4	What a hidden treasure. My family and I have eaten here twice and both times were wonderful. The first time we had take out and it was great. My boys like General Tso chicken and were not disappointed. The food rivals Sesame Inn which was our favorite Chinese restrauant until now. The second time we ate in since is walking distance for us and it was even better. I ordered orange beef and it was fantastic. Our waiter was very polite and always checking on us. I would recommend this place to anyone. It is nice to have great food so close.
