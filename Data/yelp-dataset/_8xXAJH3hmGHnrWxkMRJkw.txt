4	We bought our car here and they were really nice and helpful.  They gave us a fair price on our trade in.  The sales rep was very nice and a pleasure to work with.  Car was exactly as described.
2	The sale/price/trade all went smoothly.  The salesman proundly presented a clean carfax.  The car has been good except:1.  a google search of the vin revealed that the front bumper, front  fender, doors, and rear fender had all been replaced at the auction house (manheim) apparently to escape Carfax. All of this was on the sales slip from Manheim.  The sales guy had to know, although he claimed the buyer never told him.   Slick. 2.  after a flat tire, it was discovered the spare was missing.  after maybe 10 phone calls, and another 10 emails, several visits, and a month, a new wheel (non matching) and tire were provided. 3.  Several serious car people have told me that they are known for scratch and dent cars, hence the on-site body shop.  Those the facts in the case, as I know them.
5	Great sales staff! I was looking for a particular car that I was unable find anywhere and lo and behold Tower Auto was able to locate that specific car (even nicer) within days and the price, well unbelievably great! They have my business for life!!!
