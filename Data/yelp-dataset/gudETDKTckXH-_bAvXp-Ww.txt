5	Lindsay and the staff did a great job getting my client order on press for the Auto Performance Trade Show in North Carolina this weekend. More to come...Thanks!
5	I think the process of designing and printing my wedding invitations with Page Per Page was my favorite part of planning my wedding.  Taylor worked with me for weeks to design and perfect the most beautiful invitations!  She provided me with countless proofs to ensure that every detail was exactly how I wanted it.  It was also completely in my budget! I can't say enough about the staff at Page per Page, except THANK YOU for taking the stress out of one portion of wedding planning!
