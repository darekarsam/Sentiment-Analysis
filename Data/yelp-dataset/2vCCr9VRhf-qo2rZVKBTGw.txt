5	Treasure Trove is a bit of a rarity. A shop aimed at helping the underprivileged that for a change, actually does give a shit. The result is perhaps the most loveable shop I've came across in as long as I can remember.Eleanor has already described how it works so I won't babble on, but I think the publishers of The Big Issue, who pocket the majority of the cover price themselves, could learn a lot from these people.Give an inanimate object some form of humanity, or animality, and I'm smitten, so as per usual it was the toys that almost brought a tear to my eye. An adorable, if perhaps copyright-infringing Tellytubby looked particularly lovingly made, as did all the aforementioned graduation owls which formed the window display around June. I currently have a googly eyed Windsor Knot from Treasure Trove taking pride of place on my bedside table, gifted to me by E-Bot, and I expect it won't be the last of their wares I get my hands on.The attention to detail on much of the work here can be astonishing, the cause is excellent, and pretty much every item has a story to tell. You can't ask for more in a gift shop.
5	Brilliant shop with lots of handmade loveliness!   Great for baby gifts and clothing; these make nice gifts and are good prices, all with a 'feel good' factor as it's a social enterprise!
