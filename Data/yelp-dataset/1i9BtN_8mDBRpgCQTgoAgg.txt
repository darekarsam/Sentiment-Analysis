5	Very nice people. Very comfortable and clean little place. The dentist is very knowledgeable and answers all questions. For me, going to the dentist is always a painful experience because of a general fear of pain I have associated with them. However, I never felt that here. Everyone knows what they are doing and are very nice. I would recommend this place to anyone!
5	We have been going here for a very long time!!  Both Dr. Kashyap and Dr. Patel are wonderful.  Very caring and knowledgeable.  They take time to explain everthing.  Staff is very friendly and wonderful.  We are usually helped by Tiffany, the dental hygenist.  She is by far, the BEST!!  She is so caring and patient.  She is very knowledgeable.  She will take her time with you and we love the fact that, she takes extra care in our dental care.  Even the other hygenists are wonderful.  We love this place!! Abraham family!
5	Great overall!  Dentists are great and staff is friendly
5	Finally, I have found my new family dentist! Since leaving my hometown over a decade ago, I have been searching. I have tried multiple dentists in multiple practices all over the Charlotte metro area, and at long last, I have found "the one". For the first time in years, I left the dentist feeling good about my teeth. They worked with me on financing and timing, and my whole experience- from friendly appt setting to hygienists, to the dentist themselves- could not have been better. They even let me see the machine that made my (same visit) crown - just because I was curious (I watch "How It's Made" a lot. LOL) Most importantly, I really felt like they cared about ME, that I was not just another patient to bill. My family has a dental home at last!
5	We've been using MFD as our family dentists for years and continue to be impressed with the care and service. I always feel like I am in good hands, thanks to their combination of leading dentistry technology, winning personalities and caring spirit.
