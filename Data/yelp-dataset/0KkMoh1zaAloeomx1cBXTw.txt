5	Never heard of this place until I landed in Charlotte.  Great sandwiches at good prices.  Clean establishment and friendly, helpful staff.  Not a fan of waffle shaped fries though...
5	I frequent this location quite often.  As with the Univ. City location, service is prompt and courteous.  I really appreciate having someone in the dining area to assist me if needed.  I don't often need help, but they are there if needed.  Once I brought in a party of kids.  Fortunately, the birthday party room was not reserved.  We were able to promptly order our individual meals and sit in the party room to continue the festivities.  The staff was nice enough to bring plates, forks, etc. as well so that we could enjoy our cake.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for always providing great service.  I was not a frequent visitor to Chick-Fil-A's for a long time but I am now a fan!
5	Gotta love Chick Fil A! The staff at this particular  location are particularly kind and attentive. They suggested that I try an Arnold Palmer with unsweetened tea and their infamous lemonade...and now I am officially addicted!
3	Despite people are very courteous as always (all chick filas staff are extremely courteous) in this Northlake loc nobody was attempting to serve me until I brought it to their attention. I suggest managers train employees.
