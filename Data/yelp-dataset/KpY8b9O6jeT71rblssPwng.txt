4	I highly enjoyed my experience at Tonic Mt-Royal. I had hair treatments booked in advance with three friends. We arrived on time and the from the moment we walked in, I felt relaxed. We were offered beverages and had our robes on within minutes of arriving. From there we were whisked off for botanical therapy hair treatments. A short head massage after, my hair felt healthier immediately.After we were directed to the blow dry bar where we were had access to every Aveda hair product on the planet as well as brushes and combs of all sorts to get our hair ready for the day. For $30 it's well worth it.
4	We both got great cuts here. Guillame and Jess were our stylists. Very happy with the cuts and nicely priced. ($45 men, $65 women). They even gave us $25 each, off of our next visit. Highly recommend.
3	I have mixed feelings about this salon..In my first few years in Montreal, I used to come here all the time. Especially with a young woman at the academy named Elizabeth...Then, a series of unfortunate events took place in which I had 3 or 4 bad experiences in a row after she disappeared which prompted me not to return. (ie. the only thing keeping me there was Liz...but they wouldn't tell me where she went...so upsetting.)The place is quite nice, and is very clean and well established. However, the prices can be ridiculous depending on the level of expertise you choose, in which case, if you're brave enough, you can book your appointment with the academy upstairs.Definitely a nice place to relax..and the stylists all seem to know what they are doing so go try it out! A nice little plus...any time you refer someone to them, you get a small gift! Definitely a nice incentive to say nice things about them :)
