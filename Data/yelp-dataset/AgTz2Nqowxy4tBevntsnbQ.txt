It may be $3.99 a slice, but it's so huge and yummy - it's a super filling meal.  And it's spinach, broccoli and cheese!  I really like Sbarros.  It's a nice option from much of the other mall food.  I've tried their lasagna and baked ziti before, and they were ok.  But the real winner to me is always their pizza. The stuffed pizza particularly.  Get an extra side of sauce to pour on top and you're set.  It may not be fancy food, but at least it's not deep fried orange, honey or teriyaki flavored overly-breaded chicken bits over rice like I was offered at different spots on my way over here.

I looked around and of everything I saw on that day, the Stromboli here looked the best.  I was NOT disappointed.  The flavor and texture were wonderful.  It was a good portion for the price also so I had leftovers.  I would get it again but haven't yet because other places have opened that I wanted to try.  Someday!stromboli!
5	Lets be honest. I wasn't expecting great food from the food court at the mall. Much to my surprise the pizza was excellent! So were the bread sticks. I had the pleasure of being served by the general manager Travis. Talk about customer service. Super nice and good at up selling me on a bigger drink that comes with free refills. :)  I really do appreciate that! I was there with my wife and kids and we had a great time. Thank you for surpassing my expectations.
