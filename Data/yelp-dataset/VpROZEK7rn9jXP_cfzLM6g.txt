1	Worst service ever
4	Good sushi. Usually fresh. The waitresses are extremely sweet and helpful. I'm a regular and I never had a bad experience with them.
1	So ive been there for dinner many times and honeslty I didny like it as much as the lunch special! But then they changed their price snd they are very expensive for sushi only because its kosher. So i mean if my family decides to go ill tag along but if its by choice.. id go to maiko!!
4	the food is great, but be prepared to pay up... the service is friendly but food comes out slow. this place is often full, so do reserve ahead of time
