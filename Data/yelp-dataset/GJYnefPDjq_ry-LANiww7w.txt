2	Ok this was a dine in experience. You are WOWed when you first walk in at the live menus but that is where it ends. The tables were dirty we had to walked around and find a clean table and the place was empty. There is carpet thoughout the place so you know what that mean stains everywhere. Orders came out incorrect and missing items, I mean there were 6 people working and they couldnt find a way to make this night work. I asked for a ranch and he had to go get a new box, not even stocked behind the counter. The food was good but not good enough to dine at this location again unless another crew was on.
3	I used to go to this one frequently when it was the only fast food near my house. I moved away, and came back, and this Wendy's has gone down hill. It's still not terrible, but the service takes longer than it used to, and the food is clearly not freshly made. I realize most fast food isn't, but at least make it look like it hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp for the last few hours.
4	Not bad for a fast food experience.  The place was dead empty when we went in with two tired toddlers about 7 on a Sunday night. The employees were friendly and helpful, the food was acceptable for what it was, it was a pretty good value pricewise. The kids were pretty good and scarfed down their food and we all enjoyed our tiny Frosties, which have gotten even tinier over the years but still just the right amount.  Everything looked pretty clean, at least before we hit.  I'd go back, and I don't say that about too many fast food places.
