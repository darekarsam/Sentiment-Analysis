5	A little piece of Mexico churerrias. Mango lokos, Chamoniadas, raspados, dulces and all other kinds of goodies. Love the smooties and chamoniadas. Plus a bunch of mexican chips and candy.
5	Everything is amazing tosti elotes and mitotero mango loko  all to die for! The prices are very reasonable and the service is always great the line sometimes gets pretty long but our always moves very fast and you don't have to ever worry about quality of product I've never been let down!
5	I love this place!They sell delicious Mexican desserts that you must try at least once. This location has been recently renovated and made bigger. Before it was really small, but now it's a lot bigger, and it looks like a comfy ice cream shop you can hang out at. Lines tend to get long, but it's worth the wait, the food will not disappoint! I would say their specialty are the raspados.
4	They do a really good job here with their antojitos (tostilocos & duros preparados) but the best thing they make is on 19th Ave & Osborn: La Rusa! It's a sweet, salty & spicy drink from heaven! It always quenches my thirst and soothes my sweet tooth. The neighborhood this location is in, is not the best so I always come here with my husband. The Osborn Rd location is really nice and quiet, busy most nights during the summer. The lady who makes the items is really nice and I'm glad they have teens working here so that they have the opportunity to learn responsibility. Keep up the great job Lilly!
