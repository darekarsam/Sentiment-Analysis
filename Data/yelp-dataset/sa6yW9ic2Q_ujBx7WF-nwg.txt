5	This is a first-class bookstore with lots of French classics (and world classics in French). The owner is well-read, knowledgeable, and friendly, with an intriguing life story. If I lived in Montreal, I'd try to get there every few weeks. Let's hope this gem of a bookstore doesn't find itself closing its doors like so many these days.
5	Great store with excellent French German and English selection.  Owner is a very helpful and knowledgeable lady who helped us a great deal.
1	The owner was incredibly rude to us, and we are at a loss for why. Perhaps it is because we are tourists and speak little French? Or maybe she doesn't like students? (strange for a college town). We thought we were being respectful -- we said hello with a smile, we handled her (wonderful) books with care, we even asked her questions about where to find books. But she became incredibly agitated when my friend tried to get a book that was a bit higher than we could reach -- she insisted that he just put the book away altogether and escorted him out of the store, as if he had committed a crime. She then promptly turned to me and glowered, obviously wishing to kick me out as well. I was going to buy the book I had been skimming, but felt incredibly uncomfortable with how she was treating us. As I tried to put the book I was holding back, I couldn't recall where it belonged, and she rudely grabbed it from me, muttered something unintelligible in French to my untrained ears, and with that I left to regroup with my friend outside so that we could try and understand what we had just experienced.It honestly breaks my heart -- this could have been a memorable little bookstore with a fantastic collection, a collection that the owner is clearly very passionate about, but instead it will be the bookstore where we had the meanest encounter with a book proprietor I have ever encountered.
