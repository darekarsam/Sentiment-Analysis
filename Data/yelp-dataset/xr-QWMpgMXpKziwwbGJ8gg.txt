1	Vehicles stink because they allow customers to smoke in them! Unless you enjoy the smell of cigarette smoke, pick a different company.
1	I contacted them for a 4 AM pickup to the airport. They said it would be no problem as they can schedule 24 hour of any day.  So we booked it.  When the day came, we waited and waited. At 4:20 we called and got the voice mail only. We left a message and drove to the airport ourselves. We never did receive a call back from them. I have avoided their service since then and life has been much smoother. I suggest you do the same.
1	These people are terrible and extremely dangerous. I was merging into traffic when one of these vans pulled (#37) up next to me and started driving into my car .  honked my horn of over and over again but this did not deter this dangerous driver. I had to merge into moving traffic to get out of his way or he would have hit me. Do not take this service. When I called to complain about the driver, the man dismissed me completely and said I must be lying.
