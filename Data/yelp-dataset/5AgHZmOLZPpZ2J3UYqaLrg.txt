4	This review is dedicated to the guy that works the closing shift who always plays hardcore rap and wears sunglasses at night. What more is there to say? It's a liquor store on Green Street, so you are paying for convenience. They've got pretty much every price rance covered, save for the top shelf stuff that comes in wooden cases with gold accents. Their selection is larger than Hometown Pantry for sure. It's pretty good if you are headed to a pre-outing event in the Green Street area and you're not buying more than a bottle or two.
1	Summer hours... Open at noon!  WTF!
4	I started shopping at Den after moving this semester as it's conveniently located to my apartment. Unlike other campus stores, to my surprise, this place is clean, organized and carries a wide range of beer, wine and liquor unlike other campus stores.They are fairly knowledgable about the products and have even offered a sample to taste on several occasions (just ask!)Be sure to look out for their Facebook specials (prices are pretty reasonable for being a campus store)Pros: convenient location, large selection, and friendly staff :)Cons: warm make your own six pack :/
