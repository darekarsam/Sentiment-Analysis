5	I love this place!! Fabulous, fresh food, lovingly prepared and served. I had the house salad and it was truly wonderful with the best tomatoes ever. Seriously, I would eat lunch here every day if I could. I also love the music and sound system, playing old jazz classics. Good magazines also.
3	Totally empty on a Thursday afternoon. We were looking for a smoothie place and they advertised it on a sign on the sidewalk.The cashier/barista guy is really cute ;)My husband had a smoothie, I had a baguette sandwich (avacado, brie, tomato). Everything seemed really fresh. It was a great mid day snack.Bonus: Free Wifi  (just ask the cute guy behind the counter for the password)
