5	In for three visits.  Buffet price can't be beat.   Born in the USA, love to eat and everything was good - everything (you know how you expect to run into a few things "you don't care for" -- didn't happen)  Tasteful bright, fresh decor inside.  Nice round tables with plenty of room to move.  Prompt, courteous hospitality.  Flipped when they said they were open seven for seven.
1	This place was awesome a few years ago but they must have changed hands. They have discontinued some of our favorites. The order before the last, they forgot to include our spring rolls, would not refund the price and would not run them out to us because they were busy. The last order I mentioned that we had the spring rolls coming because of the last order and she tried to send me two....I said NO, we paid for four, I want the four. THEN it took almost 2 hours to get to us!!  I called back twice because I had my 4 yr old begging me for dinner. I demanded my money back, they offered a discount on the next purchase. I told them I would NOT be ordering from them again, I want my money back. The guy FINALLY showed up as I was on the phone, the lady had me hand the phone to him and he gave me $5. The food was partially spilled and they forgot the fortune cookies.I will not be ordering from here again, bad service and the food is not worth the price. Maybe their buffet is better but their delivery SUCKS!
5	I wonder if this is the one at 6003 albermarle --- i ate their tonight and it was fine.  I had the orange chicken with some lo mein...high on the flavor quotient. They got it right out to me.  It looks like the $5.95 buffet ends at 7 pm now except Sunday.
1	Phone number rings and rings....I think this place closed as we've stared at menus for hours and finally call to order and!  No answer.....FYI
