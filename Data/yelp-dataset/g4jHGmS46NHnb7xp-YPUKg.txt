1	An abomination....the billing department is run by a level of incompetence of which the likes have never been seen.  Ever get a bill 2 yrs late, then pay over the phone with a credit card, only to have the payment never recorded and then receive harassing phone calls?  Well I just did....
1	Absolutely wretched and incompetent billing department.  Overcharged four months in a row, called every month and was repeatedly told it would be fixed.  I went to American Express to file a dispute and at least they were able to reverse the four overcharges.  Even after that, I was randomly charged for a system upgrade that never happened.  I am considering filing a complaint with the better business bureau and the attorney general.
1	If I could leave ADT Security a negative review I would.  This is the worst company as far as billing & customer service are concerned.  I work for a General Contractor on the West Coast and we use ADT for our clients.  Security patrol is standard, but the problem is that their invoices are obscure to the point of insensible, referencing 3 other invoices that were never received.  The only way that you can view the invoices is to login to their website with a password no one has, from a letter that is only mailed out the jobsite.  I AM NOT AT THE JOBSITE WHERE CONSTRUCTION IS DONE, I am in the business office where we pay bills.  Their CSRs put you on hold for 10-15 minutes at a time only to tell you lies about what they can do, then you have to call back and deal with them all over again when the lies are uncovered.  They are the worst company, do yourself a favor and stay away from them.
