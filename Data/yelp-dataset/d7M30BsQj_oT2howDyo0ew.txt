2	About the best thing I can say about Subway is that my tastebuds will never be offended by flavor when eating there.  And I mean good or bad!  The thing is, Subway is just so bland at best.  And it seems like they have no quality control over their restaurants.  This Subway seems to be one of the better ones, meaning that it's bland.So what was I doing eating here yesterday?  A friend of mine came to visit me for the weekend and I had no time to do any grocery shopping.  Plus, I had to go do a home visit as part of my job, so I needed a quick lunch.  Quick and bland.  Believe me, although it wasn't horrible, the Italian BMT sub is far from an Italian sub.
5	Subways are all very comparable so normally I wouldn't post a review. This subway saved me on my trip from all the horribly unhealthy Pittsburg food choices. The staff was more than friendly on two occasions and impressed me enough to give two thumbs up.
3	Average Subway - crowded at lunch.  Service is acceptable.
5	The coffee shop was closed next door and the owners saw me looking sad.  It was the afternoon, and they made a fresh pot of coffee just for me.  No one has been that nice to me in ages.I should mention that they're very fast during the lunch hour. Just a ps.
4	This is a great Subway location and the staff is super friendly and helpful. I am pleased to have such a great Subway on the way to work. Keep up the good work.
5	A very nice Subway location. Great place to wait for the Megabus. Free wifi, wall outlets, good breakfast, and friendly staff. They have regular egg and egg white for breakfast. A good healthy lunch with plenty of veggies.
