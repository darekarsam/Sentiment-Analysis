5	Top-notch customer service here!I didn't use the self storage, but I rented a Penske truck from this location. From start to finish, the communication was great and the service was exceptional. When I arrived the morning of the rental, the owner had it parked outside for me and everything was ready to go. He verified the condition of the truck, explained the best practices for driving it, and even threw in some free furniture pads. I had requested a hand truck and it was already in the truck. All the equipment was in top-notch condition.This experience stood in sharp contrast to the times I have rented from U-Haul or Budget. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this location.
1	After renting a Penske Truck from Colorado  loading a 26 Foot truck driving 18 hours unloading the truck and tried to drop it off in this location that I had set up to do so and has a 24 hour drop off  was turned away because she said they don't have room to park it but I  clearly see a lot of space she just did not want to check it in for some reason? Very unhelpful Penske's only suggestion was driving 30 miles to another 24 hour drop off.
1	The space is tight.  Not much room to maneuver your truck or trailer.  The aisles are narrow.  If you just need a place to park and don't plan on using your trailer, this place works.  The rv dump is a nice benefit but it is locked and you need to have the office unlock it for you.  They state they are there 8-5 seven days a week but on 4 separate occasions between 8-5 nobody was there to unlock the dump.  Cody doesn't understand the fine print of the contract you are required to sign so work with Tiffany when she is there.
