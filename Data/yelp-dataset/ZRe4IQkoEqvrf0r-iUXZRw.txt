5	I have been looking for a new groomer for two years and have had bad experiences until now! I just picked up my Lil maltipom and she was happy and beautiful!  I'm so impressed by the great job that the groomer Maria did I appreciated the way she took time to listen to what I wanted and executed it perfectly! I'm so happy with the results. I'm definitely coming back!
1	I was recommended to them by a friend who takes her dogs here for grooming. Unfortunately, I will not be taking my dogs here..EVER.  Although, I am happy my friend has never had a problem with this place, it took one phone call for me to decide to NEVER bring my dogs here. Customer service and friendliness was not a priority for the person who answered the phone. I called to schedule an appointment for my dog and was met with a condescending and demeaning attitude.  All because of shots my dog does not have but SHOULD have according to the woman who took down my information.   Dogs are required to have their rabies shots, which my dog has, thank you very much. But do not berate me about my dog not having her two other shots- Parvo and Bordetella. Especially after stating that my circumstances do not allow me to afford other shots not required by law.  I can understand if I regularly board my dogs, but I do not.  So how dare you speak to me like that and tell me that I need to get her other shots. I immediately cancelled my appointment and schedule with another groomer.  And when calling to complain to the grooming manager, I was met with the same attitude. Therefore, you will NEVER have my business.
