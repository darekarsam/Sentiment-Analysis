5	They have a fast turn around and can get spots out as long as you tell them about them on drop-off. Staff is very friendly and prices are reasonable.
4	Decided to give this place a try, and deviate from my normal 2 star location across the street from Mom and Pops Cleaners.  The clothes and uniform I picked up were cleaned and pressed properly and on time.  The price was pretty good, and less then across the street.  The cashier didn't have a personality, which I actually found funny.  In the end, it doesn't matter much because its a quick stop.  I may have found a new dry cleaners.
5	The ladies here are calm and honest. Prices are decent, definitely worth the dirty expensive clothes I've thrown at them almost twice a week! I've recommended them to everyone who asks about dry cleaners!
4	Prompt and Accomodating... I was in a rush to have a huge load of sheets and clothing laundered and dry cleaned after my washing machine decided to quit.  They opened their doors early and even went as far as to call me when my items returned - same day.  It's nothing too special, but they do a good job and have taken good care of me.  This is my new place...
