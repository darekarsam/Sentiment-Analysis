5	Dr. Couser is amazing! I would highly recommend he and his team for any ortho services. Thank you for taking care of our little guys teeth.
5	Dr. Couser is an amazing Orthodontist! We see Dr. Jensen at A to Z pediatric dentistry right next-door to his Queen Creek office and when it was obvious that my son needed to see an orthodontist for a consultation we walked directly next-door. Because of his staff getting us in for a consult that day and Dr. Couser taking the time to talk to me about what my son needed, the VERY reasonable cost, and answering all of our questions we literally walked out of the office with braces on my eight-year-old that same day! My other two kids will definitely be getting braces with Couser Orthodontics when the time comes, as I am sure it will. The staff is all very knowledgeable and confident, all of my sons follow up appointments have been very time efficient and thorough.
