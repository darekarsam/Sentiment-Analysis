4	Good. Glad they opened one here. Now I can get breakfast burrito and walk over to Starbucks for coffee on way to work
5	The only way this place could get better is with a drive thru! Standard Don Tortaco/Robertos food. Greasy, cheesy, fattening goodness. They girl up front even remembers our usual order. Maybe we go their too often... It is clean, fresh, yummy, friendly, cheap. What could be better?
3	Breakfast burrito has shrunk. Loved them before perfect size but I think the tortilla is more of the burrito than the egg, bacon, cheese and potatoe now. I was a extreme regular.   Might be done.
4	Not bad. It's under new management and owners. Fresh food and goes head to head with Laurita's. I'll give more details but they are open for business.
5	Always clean, friendly staff that remembers us and always gets the order correct and prompt!
2	My cheese enchilada was cold. And the cheese weren't even melted. And the sauce they use here for the enchilada tasted like ravioli sauce. Other than that its very quiet here.
4	One of the better Mexican places around this side of town. Location: It's located near starbucks and lee's alcohol, and gas station plaza on windmill and Maryland.Vibe & layout: I go here almost ritually for my breakfast and late night snack and it's ALWAYS clean. The place is small, but it's never really packed.Customer service & food: Always greeted by a smile which is nice, and my food gets out in a very quickly time. Their bacon breakfast burrito is dankkk 15/10. Super cheesy, super eggy, super stuffed. Chimichanga: Huge and on point.Carnitas: Can be a little small at times, but it still taste good.All in all I've never had a bad experience here.Protip: They take orders ahead of time!
