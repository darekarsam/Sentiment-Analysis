5	Good Job Ernesto !
5	I received a superb keratin hair treatment with Ernesto Real about a month ago. I have always had frizzy and curly hair and after receiving this treatment my hair was perfectly straight and non frizzy. He was wonderful and took his time performing this procedure. He educated me regarding the chemicals in shampoos and hair treatments and advised me to use different products that do not contain such ingredients. Although the procedure did take roughly 3 hours, he was very prompt and efficient. He understood my needs and took the time to address any questions or concerns I had.     Ernesto was very personable and extremely professional. His personality and demeanor was warm, charming, and inviting as if I were in company of a best friend. He knows what he is doing and I will always go to him for my hair care needs. Awesome Hairstylist with superb skills and personality- I recommend him to everyone.
5	Ernesto is a pro, my keratin treatment last  for 4 months while others doesn't. Great salon in old town Scottsdale, great music to boot and excellent costumer service. I love Ernesto!
5	I agree with Diane and Richelle!My old stylist actually gave me the wrong color formula and Ernesto fixed it!! Ernesto takes the time and he has the chemical understanding of what products do to our hair and only uses the best hair color.
5	Ernesto is the BEST! I get the Keratin Treatment and it lasts the longest when Ernesto does it!! Highly recommend!
