4	This cute little cafe is a great place to meet for lunch. They have soups and sandwiches and they even make their own (yummy!) whole grain bread on site. In this day and age I'm surprised that these little cafes survive but I hope that the Den sticks around, it gives the neighbourhood more appeal!
4	Great place for soups, they usually have 3 available with their won ton a homemade specialty. Sandwiches are made on the spot with their 'made on the premises' bread. They offer a small bowl of a daily salad to go with their lunch specials. Other options are available for a small additional cost. It's a friendly easygoing atmosphere. Lunch should cost you around $10.00 including tax.  Expect to see lots of locals, they are there frequently!
4	What an amazing little cafe! Really lovely food. Had a quiche and 3 different side salads: carrot/raisin, zucchini with pepper and yellow bell pepper, and celery root. Everything is homemade and delicious. Decor is dinerish feel, but small and clean. My favorite part was the sweet man who ran the place. He was so friendly and said that the food was delicious because it was made with love. Sweet!
5	My wife and I go here quite a bit. Wonderful food and the owner ken is the nicest guy. You can also pick up homemade bread which is wonderful as well.
