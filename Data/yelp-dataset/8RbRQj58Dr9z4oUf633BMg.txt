5	These guys are wonderful. There's not much that I feel strongly enough about to review, but they were really fantastic. They removed our tree in an emergency situation. They were fast, courteous, and professional. We hated to see the tree go but were more than satisfied with the removal.
5	If you need any tree service work call these guys. They are honest and reliable and very talented and experienced at what they do. I had a very difficult tree to remove above my house (80' oak). Steve and his crew were able to bring it down safely and efficiently for a very competitive price. I was amazed at how well they did. I will be calling them back for any future tree work and telling all my family and friends about them as well.
5	I just want to show my appreciation to Flaherty Tree Service for doing such a great job with a tight turnaround. The neighbor's tree got blown on to our roof yesterday and made it necessary for our power to be disconnected until the tree could be removed. These guys came in quick, did and expert job and cleaned up beautifully. With all the craziness from yesterday's high winds and the holiday weekend coming up, we're really grateful to have this resolved! Highly recommended.
