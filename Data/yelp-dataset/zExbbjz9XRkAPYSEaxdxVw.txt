5	I went in here to buy my wife a hot tub for her birthday. I had wanted a used one, but one still in great condition. I was able to find what I wanted. They also tacked on free delivery and a warranty for peace of mind. I highly recommend them. Great customer service.
1	After researching my options I was happy to find this company stated "open daily until 6" in their ads. Not just one of their ads but several. So I drove a little over 30 minutes only to find them closed at 11:30 am. I called the number in the ad which turns out to be someone's cell phone. I explained the ad said they were open but the doors are locked. I asked what the actual hours are and he said closed Sundays. So I started the drive home. 1 hour and 10 minutes round trip drive time and when I parked I checked my phone to find a text from the store:Hot Tub LiquidatorsReally? You hung up on me? Obviously there was a simple miscue. Look at  every one of my "other" ads and you will see the hours posted correctly. Upon request I would have run over and worked with you. I'm not sure why the word other is in quotes unless they are special somehow or he is being sarcastic. I have reviewed 6 ads that all say the same thing. I've never had a business imply I should check other ads rather than believe what they write in some ads. I don't think it's my job to check the accuracy of their ads. I do think there are other places to buy a hot tub.
5	I stumbled upon this establishment while running errands in Henderson, I am very pleased that I did! I had very much wanted a hot tub for my backyard, there was an empty, built out space ready for it, just need to be filled! I met the owner on the first visit, besides being a nice guy, he was very informative and new his stuff. The place is very nice, I have been in several other competing businesses, none looked like this. There were far more spas there than I had expected. I believe I made a great purchase, and better yet, an informed one.
