5	Bill and his staff are of last truly dedicated customer service professionals that I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. They are HONEST, Hard Working and really care about delivering the best service possible. After dealing with them for years they are the best and most importantly, I can trust them. In this day and age thats hard to come by!
5	These guys are great. Bill will literally help you for free over the phone before trying to sell you on their service. He's helped me with balancing chemicals, advice on maintenance and diagnosing problems. Not to mention, they've made some repairs they could have charged much more for but saved us money. For all those reasons, I'll never call another pool company for repairs.
5	This is a really great company run by a great guy.  My dad recently tried to "fix" my parents pool and blew the pump up.  After calling a couple other places that couldn't come or didn't show, a friend gave us Bill's name at Personalized Pool Service. Bill agreed to come over the next day and make the repair.  He and his guys showed up on time and worked on the pool for the next 3 days.  He gave what seemed to be really honest advice on what parts could and should be replaced on a 20 year old pool and what parts he could work around.  He also didn't charge an arm and a leg!  I feel like it's really hard to find this kind of service and honestly these days.  We will definitely be calling these guys again when the need arises.
