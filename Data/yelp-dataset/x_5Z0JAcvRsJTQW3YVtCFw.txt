1	AWFUL!!! We would never use them again. They didn't show up when they said they would, they did a crappy job when they did show up. My husband had to finally try and do some of the work himself.  Being new to the New River area we were relying on them to direct us to doing whatever we needed to do...they ended up selling us $5,000 worth of a second tank that we never really needed. They didn't return phone calls but had no problem calling us to get the rest of their money.  Once they were paid in full they never returned phone calls to them to fix something they didn't do right in the first place.  These people shouldn't even be in business.
1	As previously stated. We're never there when they said they would be. Never returned phone calls. Went days without showing up. Will not use them again.
1	terrible.    had more excuses as to why they didn't show up.     put in new well pump.     it only lasted a few years.     have a feeling it was a used one.     all he seemed to care about was talking about the nudist colony in new river.
