4	I just needed an affordable 8' twin mattress for a daybed I recently purchased and I saw the truck advertisement in the parking lot so figured I would check it out.  They had just what I needed at a decent price and loaded it right into my truck.  I was in and out in about 20 minutes.  I did browse around a little bit.  It's a smaller store as compared to Ashley or RC Willey but great customer service, some nice living room sets and fabric swatches so you can customize.  They also offer 90 days same as cash with no credit check.  That was something I had never seen before so I asked about it.  If you're willing to bring in a pay stub and a couple other items like recent bills that payment plan is an option for you.  I can see how that would be really beneficial for those that need furniture but don't have the money or regular credit needed at time of purchase.
5	Absolutely love this furniture store! Family owned with amazing customer service. I needed a new bedroom set with mattresses & I found exactly what I was looking for. I shopped around for the same set at other places but this was by far the best price. When picking a mattress set, Javier recommended different ones. He knew what kind of mattress we were looking for by explaining what we like & didn't try to rip us off by selling us the most expensive.This store knows their stuff & will go out of their way to make sure you leave happy.
5	Low prices and very friendly service. just all around happy experience... Will be back
