1	Do not go here!  If I could give zero stars I would.  The owner will talk you into buying bad quality hair that is far over priced.  I went in looking for a particular brand and I was talked out of it by being told that the brand I was looking for had a "bad batch".  When I showed up at my hair appt 1 hr later my stylist refused to put it in.  I live in CA and drove to Las Vegas to get my hair done and was unable to do so because of this store. When I called to inquire about returning it I was lectured and actually yelled at by the owner himself.  He refused to return the hair stating they do not give money back.  I was not informed of the policy, it is not stated anywhere on the receipt, and did not see it in store.  This is how a local business with stiff competition down the street wants to do business.  Sounds like they will be going out of business if this is how the owner treats customers.  Canyon Falls is the place to go, they only sell top quality and do not treat their customers how Nicole's does.
2	It's nice to have another beauty supply store in the area, but wen we walked in, they really didn't greet us.  Then finally someone asked if we needed any help, by then we already realized there prices are alot higher than Sally's.  And we felt like they were following us around like we were going to steal something!  I won't be spending my money in this store!
1	Came here and was told that they hair I purchased was virgin Brazilian hair. I bought it as well as with some micro links. What a waste of time for me and my stylist. The extensions were out in and I didn't even last a day when I told my stylist that the hair was shedding and felt horrible. I threw out $200 so upset!!!! . I wouldn't recommend this place.
