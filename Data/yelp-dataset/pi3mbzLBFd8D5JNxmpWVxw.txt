4	A good phlebotomist it hard to find. Seriously. Therefore, when I donate blood, I head over to this Red Cross on Park Road. Because, you guessed it, their phlebotomists (blood drawers) are top notch. You may think I'm being a bit facetious when I yammer on and on about their staff, but I'm not! Every time I've gone in here to donate, they are great - super friendly, funny and knowledgeable. They also play some great tunes in the background. The facilities are also pretty nice - plenty of testing/question rooms, comfy chairs and superb snacks. Yes, they have Nutter Butters. Scoooooore! And, honestly, every time I get my butt over here to donate blood they really do seem appreciative. I'm typically in and out with an hour - but if you're pressed for time, make sure you call and make an appointment. This is my go-to nonprofit to donate my precious O negative. Save three lives, score some tasty snacks and donate blood, people.
4	I have been here several times to donate. I use to donated platelets here. I stopped because they would call me every two weeks and it just become too much.  Now I donate whole blood. The staff is always friendly and there is never too long of a wait. Parking and easy and the facility is very clean. And since you can only donate whole blood every 8 weeks or so, I don't have to worry about getting calls too frequently!
5	Courteous staff and volunteers. Safe and efficient. In and out quickly. Very clean.
4	My wife and I donate blood and platelets every 6 weeks.  This is where we go and the people that work here are friendly, service is quick, and it's never really busy.
5	Always a pleasure to come here!  Genuinely awesome staff, short wait time, painless  donation process.  I love the ARC and this is my absolute favorite place to donat
