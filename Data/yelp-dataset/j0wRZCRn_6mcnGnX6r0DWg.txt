5	I came here looking for a good cut and defiantly got one.  The haircut was $16 and is a bit more than what I was used to paying, but it was worth the service that I got. The fade was better than any I got at my previous barber and the customer service was 1,000 times better.  Thank you Derrick
5	Top barbers! Great customer Service! Friendly environment! I have been coming here for years and got a haircut from each barber. They all are great!!
5	Great service! Had a good talk with my barber Derrick while he was cutting my hair. Great environment and good price! Definitely will go back.
5	Best hair cut I've gotten in a while. Staff was super friendly. Definitely prefer going here instead of the bx. I wouldn't trust those people with grooming my dog.
