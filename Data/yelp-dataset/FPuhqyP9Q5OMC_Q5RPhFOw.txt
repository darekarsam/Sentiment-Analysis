1	I have never moved in my life or used a moving company., so when I  to ask some questions., I got a lot of attitude and condescending responses., really., of course my questions are very basic such as do people use your trucks for cross country moving., the answer should be a simple YES., It should be not roll your eyes and say what kind of question is that .? That what our business model with a ton attitude., then onwards every simple question is followed with attitude., i will never go to this store.,
5	Great service, nice trucks, friendly staff!! In typical Penske fashion they are organized, prepared for your arrival and on top of everything they do. Very impressed but not surprised. The one thing I will say is check out the back lot, it's miraculous how they get all the trucks parked in such a small lot!
3	Great prices!The one downside was, the guy at the counter was RUDE!!! Acted like he hated his job and everyone coming in and out..As if I needed more stress during this moving process...
