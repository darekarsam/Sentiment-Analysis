5	These guys are awesome!  Their cabinets are the least expensive that you can find anywhere and they look amazing!!!  We redid our whole kitchen, including granite countertops for less than half of what other people were going to charge. When they (1 guy) come to install, it is done quickly and perfectly, and in my case, in just 1 day. I cannot say enough good things about everyone at West Coast Cabinets. If you need new cabinets or counters call them. They could not be friendlier or more helpful.
1	There is a 3 inch over hang on my cabinets that looks awful.  They gave the cheapest bid for a reason....their work is terrible.  The owner swore that this overhang was 'industry standard' as other contractors disagreed.  Do yourself a favor and pay 10% more somewhere else and get better quality work.
1	Don't waste your time. First, we went to their store to look at countertops with interest in having cabinets done also. One person was there, Josh who didn't know much. Based on dimensions I provided, the price for the counters would be $2,500 according to him. The owner John Joshes dad, came to my mom's house and told us his kid was wrong and he would give us the quote for the entire job in a few days. Thirty minutes after he left, I had a question and called, but only could leave a message. I called again in a couple more hours and could only leave a message again. That was three weeks ago and he hasn't called back. To me, that's rude and not good business.
