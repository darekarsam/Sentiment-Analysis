1	These people wrote up and signed a contract for 2 signs for my new location of my medical practice.  They are a professional company, have been doing this work for many years, and should know the standards of each county and community in Las Vegas and Henderson to create appropriate signs.  Not only did they not realize they signed a contract with me to make 2 signs (they thought there was only one), but they signed and agreed to a contract for signs that were REJECTED by the city of Henderson.  Now they are trying to up-charge me to do the job (for which I have a signed agreement), and they took my banners down (that I paid for and had printed to make my presence known while the signs were being done) over 2 months ago.  So now, nobody can find my business, and they are refusing to stay with our signed agreement for fees.  Now I have to pay a lawyer to take care of this situation.  They are horrible and unreasonable.  They should suck up the difference of a couple thousand dollars to adhere to their signed, legal agreement.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND DOING BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY!
5	I have a furniture store here in Vegas and used Paul's Signs. Very happy with the job they did for me. From the beginning they were very upfront and honest. They were able to beat everyone else's price and finish the job when they said they would. I will work with these people (Paul) as well as recommend them to any friend.
5	We have a home neon Corona sign that we bought online. The bottom "Extra" stopped working.  We brought it to Paul's Neon Signs. The staff were all very courteous, and the price quoted was exactly what we were charged. It now works perfectly.
