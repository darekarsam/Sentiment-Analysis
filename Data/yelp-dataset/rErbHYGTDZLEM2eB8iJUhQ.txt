1	The only reason they get 1 star is because there isn't a 0.  I don't have a clue how anybody lives here with management that is beyond incompetent.  Made an appointment to go see a 2br/2ba.  Got there to be informed that it was being renovated and couldn't see it.  They said it would be ready on the following Saturday.  I called on that Saturday, they said it was ready.  So I go down the following Wednesday and they say I can't see it because it's being renovated.  If this is my experience trying to rent from them I can only imagine how bad it is for the actual tenants.
1	I would also like to give this property 0 stars. AWFUL  customer service. When I first moved in here the original management was awesome! But now I know everyone else. However the only one that stayed was the assistant manager. He is just an horrible person, Very mean and not friendly at all. The maintenance took a good 3 weeks...I requested multiple times to have my bill from moving out to be mail to me but instead, I got a collection letter. When I reported this to Orian (The main company) no one cared. So DO NOT LIVE HERE!
