5	If you are looking for a personal injury or DUI lawyer, then Robert Reeves is your man.  He is very down to earth and you always have the feeling that he has your best interests at heart.  What set Robert apart from the rest for me was his 21 years of trial experience and the fact that he used to be a registered nurse (RN).  This gives him a lot of insight into the industry and he can defend your case in a way that no one else can.  Give him a call today and you will not be let down.
5	This was my first experience with Reeves, Aiken & Hightower LLP and their services.  Greg Spink handled my case from the beginning and his knowledge about the law was impeccable.  Not many lawyers give you direct access to their cell phone but Greg was accessible any time of the day.  His professionalism when dealing with my case was outstanding and the favorable ruling was icing on the cake. There is a reason this law firm is rated one of the best in North & South Carolina - my case is a testimony to their dedication and hard work. I highly recommend this law firm and the services they provide. Thanks, Greg!
