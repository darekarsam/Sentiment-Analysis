3	Had the place all to myself. The guy working there wasn't friendly, but still he did his job and the sandwich was good and satisfying. No complaints at about the food.Going west on Dunlap, however doesn't make this place very accessible, and the strange orientation of the sad little strip mall didn't help. Trying to continue west after my little pit stop wasn't easy either. Oh well, I was hungry and ultimately I got what I wanted :D
1	The man who served me did not make eye contact and was not friendly. If you're looking for good customer service I do not recommend this subway. I would drive the extra mile to go somewhere else.
1	Unhappy employees and poor management. Always out of any sale items and the employees look at you like you just insulted them every time your there..
