5	Great service and food.
3	I recently had my wedding here this past weekend, the venue was nice, the food was good. However, I am very disappointed in the wedding planner nadine, she was very rude to all of our guest.  She was rushing everybody and running on her own time instead of ours, and stressing everyone out including me, the bride!
5	Have your wedding here!  Nadine is awesome, the food is awesome, and the venue is beautiful. You get a lot of bang for your buck too. We just had our wedding there and would do it again in a heartbeat.
4	My Arizona Burger was cooked perfectly, and my wife was impressed at the quality of food for what is essentially a small sports bar. The waitstaff was friendly and responsive. 10/10 Would come again. Four stars because the menu is not too extensive but seems to be cooked well. My wife made a joke about a "hidden gem" so that comment goes in here too.
4	We played golf here the day after Xmas.  We had three generations, and they let us play as a six-some!!  We teed off at about 2:30, and since it was a cold day, there was nobody behind us, so we could play with no pressure.  The fareways are in pretty good condition.  The tee boxes were a bit rough, and the greens could use some work.  But, for kids, it was great!  The funniest thing was the stray pug that we came across on the 8th hole.  He was really cute and jumped in our cart!  We had to push him out though, as we didn't need to take a dog home with us.
