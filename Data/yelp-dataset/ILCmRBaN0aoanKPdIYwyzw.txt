4	A rarity in Montreal,  a BYOB Chinese restaurant that has been around forever.   Good solid food at reasonable prices.
5	This place is sweet, sweet like the general tao's chicken which is awesome.I've been there 3 times recently and its awesome value. You can BYO and eat a lot of food and its always under $15 including tip.Highly recommend it.
4	Absolutely amazing food with GENEROUS portions.  Their General Tao chicken is absolutely phenomenal.  Their sauce is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy.  The chicken is all white meat and the batter isn't a thick gooey mess like most places that serve General Tao chicken.  The batter is thick enough to know it's there, and thin enough not to impede on the chicken taste, and doesn't leave you with a mouth full of dough and a small piece of chicken.  Instead it's the opposite..And their Hot and Sour soup is TO DIE FOR!  I can eat them all day.   Their black bean and beef is also amazing.  Their shrimp fried rice believe it or not, is their chicken fried rice with shrimp added to it.  Talk about bonus.  You get chicken AND shrimp in it!  They also mix challottes with the rice too giving it a really nice flavor.  The dishes at this restaurant are top notch, the prices are very nice, and I like the ambiance (their fish tank is nice)I would DEFINITELY recommend this place.
