4	The manager is very helpful and friendly. I went in to get some specific shoes and he helped me the entire time, and took the time to explain a few things about the company who made the shoes (Toms). He made my visit personal, and now I'd love to buy my shoes from there.A second time I went in, the staff member (not the manager) was just sorta ok... no where near as nice as the manager. I was sort of upset the manager wasn't there.
1	Awful customer service. I came up to the counter with a pair of shoes to exchange and both girls were lacing shoes, looked very annoyed that was bothering them and after an awkward silence one finally said "hi" without eye contact and an attitude. One of the girls was very vocal and made it obvious that they didn't have the pair of shoes I was looking for. However she approached this with "nope. No. No we don't have those" and walking away. The whole experience has made me want to never return to this store which is unfortunate because I love it normally.
