5	Menu has been updated and new owner really cares. My new favorite place at chandler fashion square to eat. They have grilled turkey and chicken which is awesome!  Love the food here and the staff is great!!
5	YUM! Love the wrap option, makes for a lighter meal! All food prepared fresh on a grill right in front of you. Delicious! Great fast food option,  without the fast food taste!
5	Loaded fries with bacon and cheddar mmmmmmm. This place tastes great the owners work there and it is fresh fresh fresh. I had the boom boom with mushrooms and a loaded fries with heaven on top! Strongly encourage you check them out.
