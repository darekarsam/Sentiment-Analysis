5	Absolutely the best vet we've ever had the pleasure of seeing! Every person in this office is friendly and treat your pets wonderfully! You can always hear them in the back ooohing and ahhhing over your babies! They are always reasonable in price; Dr. George always explains each treatment option thoroughly and takes his time with you and your pet; you are always made aware of cost before they do anything. Hours are convenient, and you don't ever need an appointment. Dr. George treats exotic pets too, which is how I found him (I found a Quaker Parrot and searched for a vet to see him ASAP). I cannot rave enough about Dr. George and his entire staff! I have referred many to them, everyone loves them!
5	I love this office.  The whole staff is wonderful and Dr. George is super thorough. They allow you to come in the back and watch your animal be treated so you can calm them.  On times I haven't gone all the way back I could hear Dr. George discussing the things I mentioned to him with the rest of the staff..like my kitten's food preferences etc. It's just a homey, nice place where you feel your pets are getting wonderful, attentive care each time.
5	I have had dogs my whole life and lived in several different cities, Archdale animal hospital is easily the best. Dr George and his staff really care. They all go.out of their way to make sure your pet gets the best care possible. I would and have recommended them to any pet owners.
