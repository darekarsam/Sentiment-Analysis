1	They made me wait over 30 minutes for my first appointment, yet if you are late 10 min you get cancelled and charged $10.  Front desk tried to charge me a co-pay of $35 yet my insurance covers 100% with no co-pay or deductible. Would not recommend. Find a better place to get your physical therapy.
5	I have never had any issues at Canyon. The front office staff is very helpful and kind. I've never had to wait more than a few minutes to be seen, and while being treated the therapists are very knowledgable and very passionate about what they do. I would definitely recommend Canyon to anyone who needs physical therapy by someone who actually cares to help you get better!!
5	What an amazing group of people! Today was awesome! They know what they're doing and I feel great after one session. I play professional golf and have a major hip problem, this will help me tremendously with the flexibility in my golf swing. I'm so happy with them and where I'm headed !!! Check them out!
