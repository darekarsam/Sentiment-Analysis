5	My husband and tried out this new(small and quaint) restaurant for happy hour.  Prices are CRAZY good!(1/2 price apps and the drink prices were great too!)We have tried the nachos(huge and delicious). My husband loved the meatballs(best he ever had) and the chili (somewhat spicy but he doesn't like a lot of spice) Also they had great entertainment on the weekend. We will love this place and can't wait to try things off the regular menu.
1	I am sorry, but this restaurant is not going to make it!  They have very inexpensive prices on the menu, but what you get is what you pay for! My husband was going to order the filet, wanted it rare. The owner said, the steak is very thin! (1/2"). You cannot cook a steak that thin, rare! The owners are  trying to be waiters, servers, bartenders ! Music was nice, but the decore was not finished. Will not go back!
1	I'm with Cheryl.  I would be shocked if they make it.  Limited menu, there wasn't an entree salad option.  Ordered dinner salad and it tasted like ready made bag salad and bottled dressing.  My husband had Chicken Alfredo and sauce tasted like it was canned.  The bread was a warmed hoagie roll.I don't think they make anything from scratch.  I hate to be so negative but I don't think they are really trying!  No one greeted us when we walked in and they didn't greet anyone else who came in after us, it was awkward.
3	Prices are reasonable. Location hard to find unless you know where it is.  Food was typical bar fare.  When we went they were still finishing the build out so we hope things improve.
