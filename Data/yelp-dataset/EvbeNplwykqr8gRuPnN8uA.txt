5	My trip to see Dr. Melander was THE BEST I've ever experienced. I usually leave other dentists in pain but I felt no pain at all. Everyone at the office was nice and professional. Most importantly, I love the way my teeth look and would highly recommend this dentist to anyone that wants a smile makeover :)
5	I finally have found the BEST dentist! Dr. Bjorn is very detailed in all that he does! Monica spent a lot of time with me while I was there, and I greatly appreciate that! If you are in the market for a dentist, try them out. you will be pleased with the quality and service!
5	I had my first visit to Dr. Milander today. I was greeted with a warm welcome and taken back immediately. The hygienist *im so sorry I am awful with names* was bubbly and sweet. Had me laughing!! I needed some fillings and was able to get it all done immediately. While watching netflix!! Dr. Milander has a way of making you feel at home and comfortable. I got fitted for Invisalign and can't wait to trust them with my smile. Thank you guys:) Oh and he fixed a chip in my front tooth that looks simply perfect!!Happy customer!
5	Dr. Melander was very professional  and friendly.  I was a bit nervous trying out a  new Dentist  but within  a few minutes I was very comfortable  and relaxed.  He took time  and explained  everything  he was doing. His assistant   Monica was a very attentive with a great  personality. I would highly recommend Emamor Dentistry.
5	I was the grand prize winner in the raffle for teeth whitening.  I was not sure what to expect when I heard it would take about an 1 1/2 .  When I arrived to the office, it was really nice and welcoming.  I was able to watch any movie I wanted on Netflix.  It made the time go by so fast.  At times I forgot where I was.  All in all it was a great experience and I would highly recommend this team.  Thank you Enamor Dentistry!
