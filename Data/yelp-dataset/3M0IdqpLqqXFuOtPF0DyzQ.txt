5	Let me tell you, if you want a mom and pop bar, with a rugged but friendly crowd, come no further.  The food is to die for and they have awesome wing night every Wednesday (look them up to be sure) with great beer specials.I love this place....just wish they didn't remove the T-stop there.   It would make it much easier to get home.
5	Fantastic local bar. Great bar food & a nice beer selection. Good vibes & people too.
3	The food is good, and have decent prices, but you have to go there before 5. Once the regulars start to show up you'll want to get out of there ASAP.   I'd give it more stars just because I ended up banging the girl who was bar tending but I ended up marrying her so I'll stick with 3 stars.
3	The food is great although I think they need a dance floor and a D.J.
