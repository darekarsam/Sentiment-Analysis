3	A large, semi-industrial space chopped up into about 30 individual hair studios.Pros: lower rates! There's no salon taking a cut, so people can charge the prices they want for cuts, colors, styles, etc, interior styling is colorful, artful, cute.Cons: not walk in friendly, as you have to buzz your stylist to get in the building - hair dryers and heat stations can get a tad crowded, located in kind of an industrial park, so finding the building can be challenging.My girl Jill has a studio here, so I'll take the field trip to almost-Matthews for a good cut.
5	Well, I couldn't do a review of my backup salon without doing a review of my main salon:-) I love this individual studio set up, pretty sweet I must say, but the best treat of all........no 3 to 4 hour wait or spending your day stuck in the salon.......truly priceless I tell ya! Tonise is truly one in a million, she is all about healthy hair and even talked me into going natural(although I have regrets on many gym days, but it's all good)....she gets you in and out in no time and that to me is worth every penny!

5	Tabitha Osman is an amazingly talented stylist. She devotes much time to continuously taking courses to improve her styling skills and knowledge about hair products. LOVE the fact that she is using all-natural and organic products.Since moving to Northern Virginia, I have struggled to find a good stylist for my short hairstyle. Tabitha used to style my hair when we both lived in the same State, now I drive to 6 hours, because she does such a great job. I always get tons of compliments from friends and family when Tabitha does my hair. Definitely worth the effort of traveling so far!!
