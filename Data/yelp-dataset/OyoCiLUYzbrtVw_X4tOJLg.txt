3	This stores is a little disorganized in how they set up the shelves, so does the nut flour go with the flour or with the nuts or is it with the gluten-free? And why do I need a mortgage to buy some of the products on the shelves? Really, the normal mark-up of a grocery store isn't enough for you? You are related to the IGA chain, certainly you don't need to be $5 more than your competitors? And why don't you have some nice GF baked goods? Can't find a vegan yogurt culture here either. A good resource store that could do it better just seems to forget their own audience. If you are going to out price yourself, than I'll just come here for the stuff I can't find at the supermarket for a few dollars less... when you can get me here for everything and not make me go to two stores to stock up. Seriously... $5 more for a bag of almond flour than your competitors?
4	Tiny boutique supermarket that caters to the yoga/granola crowdThe prices are outrageous here and quite reasonable there, so shop with caution.I know i stick out like a sore thumb at this place, but i'm allowed these healthy urges oncein a while. Aren't i ?
