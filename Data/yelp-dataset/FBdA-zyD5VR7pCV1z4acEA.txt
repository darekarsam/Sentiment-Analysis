5	My husband and I get regular massages at this location. The staff is GREAT and we are always relaxed and feel terrific afterwards. I have monthly facials too and they are wonderful!
3	Went today for the first time.  The massage experience with Christine was great, however, the hard sell for membership after was a bit stressful. It killed all the the good work of the therapist!
