5	Nice and clean place to get Alkaline water. Cash only though. Plenty of various size bottles you can purchase to hold the water and also stands.
5	Biggest variety of bottles I've ever seen.. Great place to get alkaline water at $2 a gallon
4	Used to fill up my 5-gallon jug with alkaline water here at $2/gallon. After a few months of purchasing water here, I tested the pH level the day after I purchased the water only to find that the pH level dropped to normal. Now I just get their normal filtered water ($.30/gallon) and add pH drops I get from Whole Foods. Still tastes great yet at a lower price
4	I really like this store. The store is very clean, they offer water 24/7... If you chose to use the machine outside to fill your water.They have regular distilled water or Alkaline... Prices are very good! $1.50 for 5 gallons of distilled water. If you chose to go inside, they clean the bottle for you, and they also offer to help you carry the water to your car.I would recommend this business to anyone!
1	I've been coming here for awhile now.  The owner is having someone else run the business and customer service is no good.  About 3 months ago I replaced my regular bottles with BPA Free bottles.  After refilling the bottles at the store I loaded one of them into my carpeted truck and the bottom just exploded out.  I was told 1 year warranty when I purchased them from the owner, but the replacement guy says no warranty at all.   This seems crazy considering that I paid about $20 for the bottle by itself.    It always seems the best businesses take a dive-bomb when the owners are away.  I guess I'll start using a different spot...
