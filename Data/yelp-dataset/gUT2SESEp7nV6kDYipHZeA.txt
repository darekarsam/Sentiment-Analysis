1	I hear the banjos playing.  This is where the characters from the movie "Deliverance" come to work and to shop.  Having been to the newest addition in the Giant Eagle portfolio, I was somewhat stymied by the fact that this store had the same name.  When I entered, I apparently went the wrong way through the entire store.  Well, who laid at the store in that bass-ackwards way it was?  No one is going to walk past the cashiers dodging all of the out-going shoppers to get to the supposed beginning of the route you are "supposed" to take.  Someone needs to rethink the circulation.Then, the lack of fresh produce (read as wilted and moldy) and the lack of any true selection...well, I won't be returning.
5	I agree this place is lacking in many areas but Debbie in customer service area needs to be applauded for her can do attitude . She has helped me out on several occasions and solved many problems .
3	It's not a Market District but it works in a pinch. Nice bakery, not great mind you. Good Latino, Italian, and seafood sections. It's small by todays supermarket standards.
2	This seems like a dying store at one end of a shopping mall where everything else is closed. It's depressing on the outside for sure. The inside's a little better and had all the supermarket basics, but a good portion of the staff appear rather rough around the edges.  The whole location and appearance gave me the feeling that everyday the staff is expecting the word from corporate that the store is closing today.  It's OK when you need some basics, which is exactly why I came to this store.
2	I come from the land of Publix so imagine my disappointment when I moved here?  There is no seafood department. There is a lack of selection and cleanliness in the meat department.  They only ever have one or two  checkout lanes open plus the self checkout open.  Use the self checkout if you dare.
