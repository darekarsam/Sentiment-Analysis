5	I have been going to Desert Springs dental for years and have not had a bad experience. The staff is always friendly and available when I need them. It almost feels like I have a dentist in the family now... I highly recommend them!
5	If you want top notch dental care, look no further. Dr. Condie and her staff are simply amazing!!!  I am a dentist phobic (I was slapped by a dentist in my childhood) and I cried at every dental exam/cleaning until I went here. Even though I am now 40+ years old the anxiety was uncontrollable and intense... But not anymore. I have gone here for 8 years and I will never leave this office. I have completed my Invisalign services here and my teeth are perfect. My family also drives 6 hours from San Diego to her office and they love her too. The phenomenal work ethic and talent that dr. Condie possesses is one of a kind.  You will not be disappointed and I can recommend this office without any reservation whatsoever. Call today and make your family appointments.
5	Love love this place! My kids actually want to go to the dentist. Top notch staff, state of the art treatments, priced reasonably. We will continue to go here for sure!
5	I have been going to Dentist R Us for years. They are professional and personable. I wouldn't change dental offices for nothing. I highly recommend this office for other like myself, children and seniors as well.
5	I absolutely love this place. I went here for years but then realized they weren't in my network sadly so had stopped going but since visiting other offices it's made me appreciate them even more. The staff is warm and friendly and I never felt pressured to do anything I didn't want to do. I actually looked forward to getting my regular cleanings. Miss you guys!
