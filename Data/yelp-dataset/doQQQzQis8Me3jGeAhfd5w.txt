4	Subway is Subway... decent, cheap sandwiches.When I'm in the mood for Subway, I make sure to go to this one because they always have the bags of kettle chips that I love. I don't often see these at other Subways for some reason.
4	Healthy affordable fresh sandwiches. I used to eat here on a regular basis. Monday thru Friday avoid noon long line
3	You know....what do you say about Subway? I mean the bread all tastes the same and meat and cheese is just "OK". It's cheap....I guess that is what you say. Other than just general jabs at Subway this particular one is close to work, so I go there often. The people aren't overly friendly but they are fast and will get you in and out and there is something to be said for that. So I give them an extra Star for being fast and no nonsense when it comes to making my foot long roast beef sandwich.
3	This Subway is close to my office building, so I eat here a couple times per month. It's pretty much just your average Subway -- nothing terrible but nothing awesome about it. This is a good place to pick-up an inexpensive lunch relatively quickly with acceptable service.
5	Dont worry about the line out to the door here it moves super fast they can make your sandwich fast and just how you want it.
5	Rather odd seeing a 5 star review for a Subway, isn't it? But these stars go to the crew and their manager. I ate here several times a week for two years when I worked on the South Side, and this place is THE MACHINE. You're in, you're out, and hey get it right. Best Subway I've ever encountered.  These folks could have schooled Henry Ford on throughput.
