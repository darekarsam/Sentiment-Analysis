5	I've been going to this interdependently owned video game store since the owner's first location in the early 90's! This definitely is the best video game shop in Madison! I mean, the only other places I can think of are PrePlayed or Half-Price Books for older cartridge based games. I usually hang around to talk and bring in super random gaming goods to sell or trade! Highly recommended! Believe It!
5	It' where you should go to buy and sell games.  Avoid Gamestop and the other chains.  Keep this guy in business.  He isn't always able to buy your stuff, so call ahead of time if you have something specific to sell.
