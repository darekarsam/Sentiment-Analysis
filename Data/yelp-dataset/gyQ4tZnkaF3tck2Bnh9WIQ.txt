5	The service is always great and friendly here, and the gelatos are so delicious that I'm sure I'll be here at least once every week this summer. :) Plus you can also get some tasty grilled cheese sandwiches and a variety of crepes, if you're not always in the mood for gelato. The atmosphere is nice and relaxing too, so go enjoy some summer nights there hanging out with your friends. :)
5	Very good grilled cheese. I liked the peppers. The gelato is delicious. Very nice decor and atmosphere.
