5	I've used Max Plumbing for the past seven years and have always received professional and exemplary service. Their prices can't be beat, but most importantly, employees are HONEST. Five star companies in Las Vegas are few and far between. Max is one of those rare companies that earns my five star rating and loyal patronage. Truly "whoohoo, as good as it gets!"
5	AWESOME plumbing service...and the tech Robert (Bobby) is world class.  I needed to replace the main gate valve to the house water supply and it was no straightforward task.   Bobby was enormously professional with a first rate work ethic.  From the moment he arrived he was no nonense and got right to work.  He didn't take any breaks and demonstrated exceptional plumbing knowledge in solving my particular problem. And, he was curteous and friendly to boot.Arrived when promised, did the work fast and efficiently, friendly and charged a fair price.  What more could one want?
5	The plumber was on time, as nice as he could be and did the job perfectly. Great service and reasonable pricing.
5	Tech arrived early and explained everything so that we (completely unhandy homeowners) could understand.  Max Plumbing was the company we were automatically assigned to by our home warranty and we couldn't be more pleased. A special thank you to our tech Ulysses, he even took the time to write down the exact name of the last piece we needed to get ourselves (the home warranty doesn't cover "cosmetic" pieces) at Home Depot. Would not hesitate to use Max Plumbing gain, although we hope we don't have to LoL
