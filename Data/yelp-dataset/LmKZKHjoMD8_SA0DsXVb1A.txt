5	Clearly Diane B  has not ever experienced any Salon service at Abby Lane Salon , I have been an extremely loyal & happy client of not only the Salon but the owner of the Salon, who is professional , friendly to everyone, as well as an expert in her trade . Being a Stylist in Arizona for over 21 years I have chosen this Salon for my nails 9 years , the owner never cancels is always on time & does a fantastic , consistent service every time .... I highly recommend her. I enjoy the over all atmosphere of the salon & the prices are very reasonable ..
5	The owner Renee is personable and professional and seems to always make you feel at home. Leslie the extremely talented young lady who does my hair twice a week (yes I go to this salon twice a week ) goes above and beyond to make her clients not only look good but look great!!! I recommend this team every chance I get and trust me I get asked "who does your hair" a lot!!!! Why go anywhere else?
5	I go to Abby Lane for my hair and nails needs. I live all the way in Avondale andwork occasionally in the area of the salon. When I started coming here and discovered Bobbie and Diane I decided it was worth the drive every 2 weeks. I have been coming to Abby Lane for years now. Keep up the great work ladies..
