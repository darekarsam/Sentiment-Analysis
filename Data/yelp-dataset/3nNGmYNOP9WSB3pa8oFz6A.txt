4	As much as everyone loves a second-hand bookshop, I sometimes think that their main purpose is to give localities a homely and / or bohemian feel, with the providing of books being almost ancillary. This one on Broughton Street is just like any other, a dusty treasure trove that brings back memories of a time when you could leave your door unlocked and kids would play hopscotch in the street without inevitably being raped and or / murdered.It's got as good a mix of new and old reads as you could expect from a small independent  bookshop, so if you're into a bit of literature it's well worth a visit.
4	A fantastic secondhand bookshop! I love it! The young chap who runs the place takes considerable pride in his store and carries some really interesting titles which he is more than keen to tell you where & how he came by each one (as every one of his books has it's own story)...in fact every book in there probably has its own book, also in there!As I said, I love the shop!
