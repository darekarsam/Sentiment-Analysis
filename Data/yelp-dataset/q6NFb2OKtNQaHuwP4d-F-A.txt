5	Shannon was great.  I finally found someone who knows what she is talking about and takes the time to explain procedures.  She did not try to up sell.  I can't wait for my next appointment that is next week, getting another wax and a peel.
5	My skin was broken out and Shannon gave me a peel and my skin never felt better! Shannon is very informative and she will not upsell you which is a very big plus. She really knows her products and is very knowledgeable with different types of skin. She takes pride in what she does, it shows and I value that. Shannon is like a mystic gem. Once you grab hold of one, don't ever let it go because she is well worth it! Beauty and knowledge, it doesn't get any better than that!!! Thanks Shannon for making me beautiful!!!
5	Shannon is amazing!  I go to her because she doesn't just sell you a good feeling facial she improves your skin.  She does more of skin management which as you get older that's what you want.  Every time I go to Shannon she does something different depending on how my skin is and what it needs.  She has amazing peels and products that I also can purchase that are helping me look as youthful as possible.  She has been in the business for a long time and is very knowledgeable about all types of skin whether young or older.  Every treatment she has done from dermaplaning,  microliff or fountain of youth are awesome.  I always feel like she has improved my skin for the future instead of just helping it along as it ages.  If you are looking for more of a medical treatment to reverse the years Shannon is your lady!
