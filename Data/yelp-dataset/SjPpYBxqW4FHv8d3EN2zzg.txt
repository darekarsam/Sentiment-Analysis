1	You can find cheaper, better sandwiches on the block - there's a bahn mi cart up Charter before University. I went to QQ Express a few times, and while that place isn't great, it's at least moderately interesting. Even Union South has better options. I wanted to write that Subway was the mirage to UW's food desert, but it's more like drunk goggles doubling her score to six. I guess what I'm saying is that I was hungry and thought I could do it, but today I'm just regretting it.
5	This subway has got it on lock.  It's the fastest, most consistent subway on campus.   With the line going out around the lobby during lunch, I've still never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes. The efficiency is amazing!!!
