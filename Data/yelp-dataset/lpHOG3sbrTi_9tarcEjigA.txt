5	Great selection of body jewelry and the best help I've ever had at any retail establishment (including the ones I've managed or worked at myself =O )...Samantha, the skinny, spiky haired punk rock looking chick is fucking awesome.
1	I was mislead and will never shop their again. Over the holiday season I purchased a chain for my husband and inquired if he could return it if he didn't like it. I was told yes. There we're no signs indicating otherwise nor did the salesperson mention that all sales we're final and exchanges only within 14 days. I returned 6 days later with my husband, we we're told exchanges only. He not like anything in the store so I understood.   The sales person called the regional person Prince and he did not even care to speak to me about it. She was told to call the owner Jim Regal who didn't care to speak with me about it either. They left it up to her to deliver the message.    As the vast majority of the nation is in customer service related work, I have been in the customer service field for over 22 years and can recognize poor service.    On average I speak to over 1500 people a week and will be sure to tell them about the service that Silver Effects provides. I am not an unreasonable person and was only asking for a refund for a purchase with a receipt. They did tell me that they could buy it back for  about 12% of what I paid though. How generous!  Well off to purchase a chain from a reputable business who honors their word. Don't be mislead by Silver Effects....save your time and money.
