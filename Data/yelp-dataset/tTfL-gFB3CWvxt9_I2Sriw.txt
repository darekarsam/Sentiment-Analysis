4	Tiso Commercial Street often a haven of calm, away from city centre bustle. Staff leave you alone after checking if you'd lie advice - perfect! If you do want advice, they can often be really helpful...it's worth trying to get someone who's into the activity you're enquiring about.Returns are no bother, you sometimes get advised to buy something cheaper, and the sale rail reveals occasional bargains. Sometimes can be good sales, and discount card works on sale items too! Cafe is quite nice, and ample free parking.All the above only works if you can resist buying stuff you don't need. If not, maybe you should stay away. I'm quite good at going in and NOT buying stuff, probably not an ideal customer. Still part-owned by the Tiso family, time will tell whether this EDINBURGH institution withstands the onslaught of warehouses such as Go Out***rs.Oddly, sale rail varies LOTS between stores, Ratho sometimes has best reduced climbing stuff, but it's a long way to check.
