1	Just have to say my room had a missing light bulb to help hide dinginest. Left in 3 minutes and booked room across the street at La Quinta.  Paid more but will sleep better. Wish I could have given Red Roof a quarter of a star.
1	DON'T STAY HERE. room was not clean had coke bottle and spit cup with cig but ts in it and read of urine.  Crack head central. Canceled reservation and found another place.
1	It's like they are trying to make the ghetto look classy. But, a ghetto with new bed dressing and a half assed paint job is still a ghetto. Even the "newly renovated" room we asked for, since only 50% are, is disgusting and not actually renovated. It's just a shoddy job of putting lipstick on a very nasty pig.
