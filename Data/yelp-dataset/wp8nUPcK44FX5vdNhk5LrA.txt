1	This was terrible idea.. I knew it the instant I decided this what I was going to do... Go to a Salon located in WalMart.  But my logical thinking was, I have a very basic, no frills cut, how badly could it POSSIBLY be screwed up??  Turns out.  You CAN, INDEED, screw up a very basic haircut.  And not only screw it up, but REALLY screw it up.  Without being a professional hairstylist, I cannot detail the cut itself.  But I ended up looking like an Umpa-loompa.  Which is not the look I was going for.  I have shoulder length hair, and blunt bangs.  My instructions were merely to trim along the existing cut, and trim my bangs so I can swipe them over to the side.  I ended up looking like a Umpa-Loompa.  And I didn't look like an Umpa-loompa going in.If a girl named Maya comes at you with a pair of scissors - Put on a hat and run.  Fast.
4	Forget that it's located in Walmart, just ask for Corena.  She is amazing, listened to everything I needed and gave me a great haircut.
