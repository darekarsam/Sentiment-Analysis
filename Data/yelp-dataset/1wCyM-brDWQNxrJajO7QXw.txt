4	I never intend to go here but I often get drawn in after shopping at Giant Eagle. I don't know why. I do enjoy the Popeye's spicy chicken and the mashed potatoes. One time they gave me a free drink because I had to wait so long for my order. And I love that they offer Strawberry Fanta!
5	Great value, good food, friendly service. Love the biscuits and red beans and rice. The spicy chicken is the best. The Po' Boy sandwich was nice size. I hope this store stays around. It is worth the drive from the North Hills.
3	Pretty much like most Popeye's. Friendly service and pretty good food, self-serve free soda refills. Unfortunately this place wan't air conditioned the day I went making eating in very uncomfortable.

1	Bathroom in this place is disgusting. I went at 6 pm and they appeared to have not been cleaned for the day nor was there any toilet paper. Why would you ever buy food with a place with such a disgusting bathroom!!
2	Just got back home from this place.  I was extremely disappointed in my visit.  This place was definitely way under staffed.  We waited forever to get our meals.  There was always a line while we were waiting to order, waiting and waiting for our meals to come, and also while we were eating, the line continued.   The employees seemed to be stressed and with the amount of staff and customers ratio, I can fully see.  The dining room was not kept up.  I had to clean two of the tables that we were using.  All the unoccupied tables were messy and needed to be wiped sown as well as the condiments stand and drink fountain area.  I ordered a small drink and took the last lid.  The food was good.  However in all we had six meals that were ordered.  My friend asked for another sauce.  I did not get one.  They were going to charge her.  Now I don't know if this is a corporate thing or franchise.
