2	= = = = = =  DAILY LUNCH BUFFET  = = = = = =Stopped into this busy JB's for their Lunch Buffet today, in hopes of having it be better than the one I tried four days ago at their Mesa location.HS, everybody in this busy place is OLDER THAN ME!!  Can you imagine??     :-OOk, never mind that.  The menu was the same here as Mesa, & the best value comes from ordering the Soup & Salad Bar Buffet along with a half-sandwich & fries, which only add about a dollar to the price.  Incidentally, don't waste your time trying to get a useful look at the menu on their Web site.  It's a nearly impossible to navigate & read this unpriced train wreck and parts of the pages are not even in scan range!  Did the moron who wrote this site ever try to proofread it before posting  to the server?  Does anyone on JB's management team have a computer to look at this mess?  Eek!     :-O Sorry, I digress...     :-)So I ordered a Ham & Swiss Melt half-sandwich on whole wheat, with Fries well done, to go with the Buffet, & then started on some Beef & Barley Soup (meh) and then some Cream of Broccoli (ok).Before too long my half-sandwich arrived.  Instead of being on whole wheat bread it was on white, & the fries weren't well done.  I had to hunt down the waitress to ask for some napkins, & she eventually brought me two, the little 1950s style things.  That was the last I saw of her until she brought the check.The 42 salad bar items (plus dressings) were ok but the whole thing wasn't well thought out.  For instance, there was salsa with nothing to go with it, and BOTH fresh and canned pineapple.The bottom line?  Of the 6 other Buffets that come to mind immediately right along this same street, at least four are much better!     :-OLunch Buffet + Half-Sandwich & Fries:  $8.59/$7.73 Sr.
3	Greeted and seated promptly, server was friendly and checked back. I chose an omelette, with fruit and sour dough toast. Tasted okay however nothing special. I would suggest they learn how to garnish their dishes to make it more eye appealing and for health reasons remove the extra silverware from table not being used. My 1st visit there and it appears to be a busy restaurant for local folks.
4	went after watching nyphil at the lincoln center. made reservation about a month ahead, and they still set us right by the entrance. Food was ok, service was ok.
