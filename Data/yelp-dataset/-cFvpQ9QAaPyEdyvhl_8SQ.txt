5	An awesome place to get your hair and make-up done.Come in and see Janella and the other awesome stylist in there.
5	Stopped in hair for a hair cut and style and came out happy with my cut, it was 1/2 the price of the salon I had been going to!Its a nicely decorated place with a laid back atmosphere. The hair dresser didn't try to up-sell me on a bunch of products which was a sooo nice for a change!
