4	Great, huge store now.  Store is in great location near Northlake Mall. Store is very bright and exceptionally clean. Great customer service. They greet every customer that comes in. In addition, they ensure that  at least 3 registers are open to service the customers and get them in and out. There's no other party supply store that's going to give you enough options and not be cluttered and pricey. Also, you can get coupons when you sign up through their e-mail list.
2	There was an issue with the product I purchased. When trying to explain, denied a refund. Didn't appreciate that. Just know that if your product is defective, you don't get get refunds here. Ok experience during check out. Not so great upon returning the product, once I was told I was not receiving a refund.  Buyer beware.
1	Was told by a store in Colorado that my name would be in there system associated with a discount but this store would not honor the discount.  They are not military family friendly! Will not return to this store ever.
