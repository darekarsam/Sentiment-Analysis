5	The owner Derrick was my artist from the beginning of my tattoo addiction, he always treated me so well, made the sessions fly by with ease and always catered to my needs. I have seen some pretty shitty tattoos on close friends and I am super thankful that I found an artist from the beginning that knows his shit. The shop he opened is incredibly appealing, a lot more upscale then most of the hole in the walls you find in Arizona. Recently I texted him about a piece and found out he was in an accident but sent me to Mike (I believe) and told me I would love his style and he was correct. The artist banged out one of my favorite tattoos really quickly and exceeded my expectations!Love this place and the staff-Brittany nelson
5	The owner Derrick was recommended to me by a friend that used him.  I made an appointment to meet him and discuss options and price. The place was very clean and I felt extremely comfortable.  I then made an appointment to have my "mothers" tattoo done.  He made the experience as painless as possible and did a great job on my tattoo.  I will definitely go back to add more hearts as my kids have children.  I have two more planned and look forward to getting them done by Derrick.
5	Been to Mikey at Lighthouse Tattoo for 7 different tattoos now, new and cover up, always happy with the outcome. I also have a few great pieces of framed artwork (which you can also get at the shop). Great location and clean shop. All the guys are friendly as well as great artist. I have yet to see a bad tattoo leave.
5	Amazing custom shop. Love Mikey Oneal and Chris Villone's work. Wouldn't think of going anywhere else.
5	Ask for Derrick, the owner, he's a great dude and did an amazing job on my first tattoo!He makes you feel at home, and makes quick work. The guy is also a very talented artist, just give him even the slightest ideas and he comes out with a beautiful piece of art!I will be going here for my next tattoo, and I suggest you do too.
