4	One of those hostels that make you feel like you're home. Friendly, helpful staff that don't make things difficult with restrictive and unnecessary rules to just create a fun and relaxed atmosphere with some good common areas. Nice, central location just next to the train station that makes it easy to get around and get a sense of the city. Close to the royal mile and the new town for shopping. The common areas can seem small at times but mainly just when the hostel's full. The drink and food specials are pretty good too.
