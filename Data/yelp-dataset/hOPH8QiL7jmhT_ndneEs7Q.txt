5	Fabulous turkish food in a high quality decor.A great discovery, will go back!Facing Renaud-Bray on Du Parc, north of Laurier.Excellent value, must-try!
4	Finally a spot with good Turkish food with meat. I had a chance to try the lamb dish. It's same as the authentic one. My friends got kebabs, which were also good. I give 5 stars to the main dishes.Mezzes can be up to the expectations of most people but they were still lacking some authentic taste. Thus I give them 3 stars for that.Desserts: Their baklavas are quite good, Sutlac (baked rice&milk) is very good, however Asure has nothing to do with the original one. I was very disappointed that they didn't even use pomegranate in that. Don't get that one, you can easily satisfy your sweet tooth with the other two.Good and chill atmosphere. I'd recommend it for the main courses. It they boost their mezzes I think it may be an indispensable spot in Montreal's food scene.
5	Calming, soft, beautiful decoration, fresh homemade food, plenty of vegetarian choices, friendly service, and simply great experience! My husband and I had a very pleasant evening there.
