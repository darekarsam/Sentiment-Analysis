4	This is the only place I take my vehicles to get inspected.  This is all they do- inspections. They do not do oil, do not change tires, they do not try to sell you a car.....they just do inspections.Normally it does not take more than 15 minutes or so to do an inspection here, as they do have three bays open, and the staff is friendly.The waiting room is small, a small tv in the corner, and lots of magazines, to choose from.  Since it is only a few minutes for the inspection.....it is hard to complain about the chairs, or the limited tv channels, and most people tend to sit outside while they wait.I am glad they only do inspections, it just makes it easy to have the same place do it year after year, without the hassle of someone trying to sell you things you do not need.NCFoodGuy
2	I've taken my car here at least twice. Both times it failed on a defective license bulb.Not the biggest problem in the world of maintenance but they charged me $8 to screw it in.If you get your car tested here, I would recommend checking your bulbs first and if they say they need to be replaced, buy the bulb from them but screw it in yourself.
3	This is not my favorite place to get my car inspected. It is certainly not that clean, the employees are not friendly but the inspection only took 15 minutes and I passed. They tried to sell my some fluids and light bulbs, etc. I had some fluids in my back seat and asked them to help me and they refused. Probably wont be back.
5	Just left there and my car was inspected quickly and no hidden costs.  The staff was efficient and quick and that's all I can ask.
1	My vehicle was failed state inspection because of a claim I was missing specific emission equipment. So I went to the dealership to pickup the missing parts and the dealership informed me that my vehicle has never had the emissions parts in question.
