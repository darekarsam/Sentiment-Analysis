5	We have had our rescue dog Penny, that we adopted from Mini Mighty Mutts, for a while now and we love her dearly. She has been a true joy and makes us smile every single day. She is a very loving little dog.Mini Mighty Mutts is a 100% nonprofit, 501(C)(3), all volunteer, small dog rescue organization.All the volunteers donate an incredible amount of personal time and resources to these little homeless pups. The medical needs of these tiny canines are covered by the adoption fees and by private donation.  It's a wonderful group of caring people doing an amazing thing!
5	We adopted two dogs from Mini Mighty Mutts. Both dogs we love very much. They had some medical issues that the rescue handled before adoption. Considering that, plus they were both spayed and neutered, had their shots, and microchipped,  the adoption fee is very reasonable.Also they did a home visit to make sure the dogs got along with our other dogs and cats. So much better than just bringing a dog home only to find out it hates cats or is not housetrained! The whole group has been helpful when we had training questions. One of he best small dog rescues in Arizona.
5	Amazing volunteers, and 2 of our rescues came from MMM:) Best rescue organization we have worked with! :)
