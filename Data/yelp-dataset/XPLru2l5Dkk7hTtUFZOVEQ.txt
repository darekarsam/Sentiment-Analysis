4	An outstandingly good new bistro on Commercial Quay, Bistro Provence is well worthy of your attention, next time you're looking for some classic French fare. I visited at that odd time between lunch and dinner service, but found their all-day menu very accommodating. Service is as friendly as you'll find, too. Overall, we said: "Bistro Provence is a very impressive new addition to Leith's parade of restaurant excellence. The menu radiates local freshness, and dishes are executed to a very high standard. I look forward to visiting at a more conventional hour, to sample more of the Gallic delights from their menu."
