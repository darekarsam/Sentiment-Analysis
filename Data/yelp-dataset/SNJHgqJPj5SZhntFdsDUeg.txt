2	Nothing special, it is Kmart after all.  Deals are hard to come by, but you have to just look a little bit longer.  It is true that the employees really don't seem to care that they are at work.  I can relate, I did my time in retail.  Although I left it when my time was due.  Good for the area if you don't want to run to a nearby shopping area.
4	I'm surprised this Kmart has gotten such low reviews! I actually like shopping here and I come quite frequently. All the shelves are well stocked and it is clean here. It's just the lighting that may make the store look dingy. I have found plenty of good deals here, especially with clothing and hair accessories. There is even a points reward program that allows you to get additional discounts when you accumulate a certain amount of points. Another reason why I like shopping here is that it's not crowded like other department stores, so I can shop in peace. Unfortunately, that's bad for Kmart because the store seems too empty at times and it certainly needs more customers. This is not a bad place to shop; I recommend this Kmart to anyone.
1	Wow. I hope that the one experience I had here was unique and not the norm for frequent customers. All I wanted to do was to buy some thermal socks (which they didn't even have any for men!  ???). I just ended up grabbing the next best thing (Oddly, they did have thermal socks for women which I almost purchased). I go stand in the check out line, and I don't think I've ever dealt with slower people than those who work here (and that's saying something). Not one, but two of the registers I stood in line at froze, and the women had to wait for the manager to fix.  They didn't seem to mind at all, which leads me to believe this happens all of the time. I waited for my beau who bought something after I did: another 15 minute wait.  Needless to say, I will not go here again.
