3	I don't come here that often, but it's pretty good. And when I ask for gummy bears they put TONS in there! They never skimp.
4	Pretty good. Icecream is of course good but every now and then it's freezer burned. Yuck!
4	Sweet, for an ice cream treat, nothing special but my daughter loves the ice cream and the service, she got free sprinkles. LOL... a ok with me! ;-)
3	A good Baskin Robbins location. I think Baskin Robbins ice cream is a bit to sweet. This locations has really good employees and are open late which is awesome.
2	It's a very very small place you can't. Really sit and eat your ice cream. They have no bathroom around three small tables inside and out. You can't move around if there is more then six people wanting ice cream. The ice cream was ice cream when you want it. But it's not really space that says come in sit down enjoy your ice cream. It's more like come in hurry up take your damn ice cream and get out. Workers where meh adding to the feeling that they don't want you there.
3	The average size of the American food is average 1.5 to 2 times that of Japan, but here in the ice cream was also very generous. Taste of homemade ice cream is thick, but I want to also go by taste you want to eat again and again. Kind of ice cream cup, cone, There are many such as Sunday, but if you want to order a plate of ice cream, to eat one of the ice cream I thought it was just the right sized and sweet manner by two people.
