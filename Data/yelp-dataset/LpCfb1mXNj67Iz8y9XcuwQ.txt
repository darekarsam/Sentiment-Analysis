4	I'm so happy there's finally a decent Caribbean take-out in my hood!Came here a few weeks ago after dinner buddy told me there's a new Jamaican take-out in the area and it's been getting great reviews on urbanspoon and just-eat.ca.It serves all the usual suspects that you'll find at any Caribbean eatery, goat curry, roti, jerk chicken, fried chicken, oxtail stew, beef patties, fried plantains, ackee fish. I also noticed some other items I haven't seen anywhere else like pineapple chicken, red snapper, and kingfish.They really do pile on the carbs, lots of rice and peas and some fried plantains and simple iceberg lettuce salad. My friend had the jerk chicken and I had the oxtail stew. She loved her dish and my oxtail was so moist and tender, it was falling off the bone.There are hardly any seats here, not a lot of people stay and sit but they do brisk take-out and delivery business.This is a great place to know about especially on those ultra-cold, blizzard days in January and February when you're craving something warm and spicy and you don't want to venture outside, but would rather stay cozy at home. Just order in and you're set.
4	Can't get enough of this place !!Growing up in a Jamaican household with a mother that loved to cook, my standard for Caribbean food is set really high.I've been scouring this city for the last 2 years for a restaurant that makes my heart  sing and I have finally found it !!The food is well seasoned, they give generous portions and the staff is friendlyThe only thing I would say is that their rice is dry...this can be easily fixed by asking for extra gravyEnjoy!!
1	Ate there last week and decided to order for delivery tonight since the food was so good. I ordered the large beef stew, it was delicious, but had only one little piece of meat the size of a quarter and the rest was potatoes. I finished my meal, pissed, looking at my roommate eating his big portion of chicken. You guys suck!
