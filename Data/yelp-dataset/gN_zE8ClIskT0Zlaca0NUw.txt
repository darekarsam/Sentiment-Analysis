4	I definitely prefer this Marshall's to the one near downtown Phoenix. I find the staff friendlier and their aisles are more organized. Gets very crowded and a bit messy during the holiday season though, but then again what store doesnt right? I love the location since it's close to Costco, Borders, Harkins movie theatre, Cold Stone, frozen yogurt and other great restaurants. I love shopping here!
4	Great store to shop! Great prices and customer service.
