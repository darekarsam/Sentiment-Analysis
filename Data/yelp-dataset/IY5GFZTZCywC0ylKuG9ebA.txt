4	If you'd ask a Quebecois to name the first restaurant name that came to mind, St-Hubert would likely only come second behind McDonalds. It's arguably Quebec's best large BBQ chain.There's a reason for this. The chicken is delicious and so are the ribs. Now, this is nowhere close to BBQ from the south, but it's fall off the bone tender and the sauce is a good mix of spicy and sweet. The poutine isn't very good. McCain frozen fries and refrigirated cheese curds. The gravy is a power, but sufficiently spicy. This particular sauce mix is also sold in grocery stores, so if you're looking to bring home some poutine sauce mix this is actually a good one to use. Is St-Hubert amazing? No. Is it good for a date? No. But it's a solid place to take the family once in a while. Or have good BBQ.
3	I have been to Montreal over 10 times and I always wanted to try St Hubert.   The menu looked good and reasonably priced.    This last trip, we finally went.   The food was good and tasty.   The chicken was moist, the soup was hot.  We ordered a salad and it was also good.   The cole slaw was just SO-SO.Overall a nice consistent chain for Chicken, Ribs, sandwiches, etc..
3	The kitchen is open until midnight which was very convenient when my friend and I were starving and nothing nearby was open. St. Hubert restaurants are ubiquitous in the province. The food is reliable and good, and their dipping sauce is like crack. It's damn delicious.
4	We went to lunch at St.-Hubert today.I ordered the quarter chicken dinner with a breast.  It was delicious!We also had dessert.  I had a Volcano (ultra moist cake with a hot chocolate-cream filing just waiting to erupt! A treat for chocolate lovers).  Yum-mee!Dominic was our server and took good care of us.
