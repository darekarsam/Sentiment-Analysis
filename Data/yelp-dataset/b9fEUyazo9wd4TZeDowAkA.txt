1	Gangland style atmosphere as teenagers run around the restaurant screaming at each other and acting like small children. Management has no control over these teenagers. Even witnessed several teenagers pull guns on some guy on the drive thru. Got in my car and drove away quickly. Visit at your own risk.
1	Avoid this McDonald at all cost they have the worse staff and the food is disgusting sloppy and will make you sick. I hate this place it's too bad I like mcdonalds food
4	Average mcdonalds never done me wrong aside from the occasional mishap or wrong order. I will be honest the review about someone at the drive thru with a gun freaked me out a bit, but so far I haven't been shot so we are good to go.
2	My dining partner was absolutely angry after getting his order. First of all, he said he wanted to go in, instead of going through the drive-thru, because he wanted to MAKE SURE they got his order right. But, no. He was very clear what he wanted, I repeated it to the cashier, and my dining partner repeated it and clarified, yet again.But, no.My order was fine.But, no.Don't go here.
1	I do not recommend this McDonald's to anyone. This McDonald's is always dirty. Every time I come here they somehow get my order wrong. I decided to give it one more shot today since it was on my way, but yet again I have been let down. The receipt taped to the bag said the correct items on it, but somehow they couldn't get the correct food into the bag.
