5	I have had to bring my PS3 in twice once to replace the Blu-ray player and now to replace the motherboard due to the "Red Light Of Death" The guys at Vegas Video Game Repair are very knowledgeable, they are quick with a great turn around time and don't sacrifice quality work. I would recommend them to anyone needing help with their game systems!
4	Last time our Wii broke, we sent it to Nintendo and it took weeks and $$$.  This time I decided to try some local talent so we brought it by Vegas Game Repair and Mike was awesome - said he would turn it around in a day.  He was up to his word, got it repaired within a few hours at minimal charge.  Mike rocks!They fix all sorts of things here - PCs, consoles, and phones, and probably other electronics too.
4	I took my Son's broken iPod Touch here to be repaired.  The cables that controlled the volume and power buttons were bad.  They had the device for over 3 weeks, but that was because they had to ship parts from China.The guys here were pretty cool and the iPod worked just fine when we picked it up.  They would have received 5 Stars, but they didn't keep me apprised of what was going on.  I had to call every few days to get a status.  It would have been nice if they said "We had to order a part from China, it could be a couple of weeks"....instead they just said "We're still working on it, it's not ready yet".I'd come back to save money on buying a new device.Return Factor - 85%
5	My PS3 got the "Yellow Light of Death". I dropped it off at their Fantastic Swap Meet booth on a Friday afternoon. My PS3 was fixed and cleaned by Sunday. All my memory was saved and only $80. Very satisfied.
