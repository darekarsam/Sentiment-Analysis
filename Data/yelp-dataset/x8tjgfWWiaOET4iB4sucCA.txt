4	I wanted to review the cafe at the museum, not the museum itself, so I started a separate file in the restaurant category. Someone else reviewed the cafe on the museum file, but it was from about a year ago, and I believe the kitchen has since changed hands. So, my review...this is an elegant cafe only open for lunch. If you're looking for a delicious, substantial, and classy place to have lunch while you're wandering around downtown (or if you work downtown and you're on your lunch break), this is a really great option. For the summer they have both an indoor dining room and a beautiful outdoor terrace. the museum has a purple 'urban forest' display set up outside, so if you eat on the terrace you'll be surrounded by purple trees. Seeing as it was quite hot the day we went, my lunchtime companion and I decided to dine indoors in the AC. My lunch date (my brother) was here in Montreal on vacation, so we started off our lunch with some delicious white wine by the glass. They have quite a nice little selection of both red and white by the glass, if you are in the mood to go back to the office a little happier than you left. As an appetizer we each had a cold soup. I had the pea and my brother had the cucumber. Both very nice and refreshing and cutely served in mason jars. We then had the polenta with cod and the duck. The polenta was fluffy and the cod was light but creamy. The duck was deliciously rich and well portioned for lunch. And to top it all off, we had a chocolate creme brulee and a lemon tart. The creme brulee was a bit sweet for my brother, but I found it went well with our espressos, and the lemon tart was a nice combination of sweet and sour. Overall, a really great lunch experience. The prices seem a bit much for lunch, but for the quality of food that we ate, I really didn't mind splurging! We left pleasantly full.
