1	This office has the worst office staff ever! Your placed on hold when you call for up to 15 minutes and then once the pick up they are unfriendly and unprofessional. My advise "go somewhere else"
5	I raised two boys the both Dr. D's and they have been a lifeline for our family. My oldest is 20 and now in college and my baby will graduate from high school soon. Both boys have seen these docs since the day they were born. I could not have done this without their support and hand holding. They are the best!
5	Great staff in my opinion have known them for almost three years. I recommend any women who needs an OBGYN to visit Dr. Kissell, he has always welcomed my wife and I and I feel very comfortable with him. He was the best choice as a doctor for our pregnancy and the pediatric's here are very knowledgeable.
5	I like this one. Ludwig is very kind and professional. I once switched to another pediatrics and the doctor was seeking trouble with me about the height and weight of my son which they were not properly measured at the first place. Based on that experience, I will not switch to another pediatrics again.
