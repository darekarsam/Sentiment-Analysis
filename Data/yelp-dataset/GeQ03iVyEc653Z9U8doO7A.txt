5	I usually visit this place when I am in Karlsruhe. I like the atmosphere, the coffee, the vast selection of newspapers & magazines, and the fact that no one will mind if you spend hours over a cup of coffee or two, reading one newspaper or mag after the other. The perfect place to relax after dodging the trams that go down Kaiserstrasse. I can't speak for the food as this is a coffee joint for me but I doubt it is that bad since I have often seen people eating here. Very close to the Karlsruhe castle gardens if you fancy a post-coffee stroll.
