4	Darren's a dootiehead again. I found nothing wrong with their pizza or wings.
1	I ordered a pizza from this papa johns. Gave my address and waited for the pizza to be delivered. 20 minutes later I received a phone call saying they don't deliver to my address. (3 miles away) when I complained about not being told that when I ordered the manager hung up on me. Horrible customer service.
1	Awful place. Kids just working here for a paycheck, they don't care one bit about customer statisfaction. Asked the ignorant kid in charge if he could split the order down the middle as me and my buddy got the two pizza deal and he said he "never heard of anyone doing that".Pathetic pizza, absolute garbage. Stay away from this place. I'm calling their corporate number after I finish this review. IT IS THAT BAD.
