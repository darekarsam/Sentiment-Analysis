4	Glad to have this location near my home in the far NW valley, its new, its nice, good service, decent products, and a huge savings if you have stuff done yourself or if you have a great mechanic that is cheap and you just need parts.
4	This is a small but well-stocked auto parts store, and the service is particularly awesome at this location.  It's always cheerful, helpful, and efficient.  When things aren't in stock they always arrive in less than 24 hours, and they call reliably to let me know when they are ready to pick up.
1	I first visit to this location was for a battery replacement.  They told me that they could not pro-rate it because it was not their battery.  I later found the O'Reilly receipt showing the battery purchase.  They also installed the wrong battery (according to Costco AND my dealership).  When confronted they actually argued that it was the right battery even though it was half of the size of the original!  Today, I tried to purchase new windshield wiper blades.  When they did not fit, I went back to get the right ones.  Once again they argued that they were correct, even though the clips were visibly different.  In a failed attempt to prove me wrong, they attached it incorrectly to the motor arm even though the instructions had a diagram showing that this was an incorrect installation.  Even after I showed them the proper installation technique using the original blade, they continued to argue that they were the correct blades.  Wow, really?.  If you care about your car, I recommend avoiding this business.
