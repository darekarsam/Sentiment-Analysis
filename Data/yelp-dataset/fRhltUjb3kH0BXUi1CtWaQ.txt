5	Great doctor! He's very kind and very thorough. He will personally call you back if you have questions. Recommended!
1	Dr. Gregory has absolutely no care for patient's health. He clearly clocks in and out. I saw him repeatedly over 2 years with no push or additional testing toward a diagnosis. Just put me on anti depressants. I later went to the Mayo Clinic and was diagnosed with diabetes which went untreated for those 2 years under John's watch.
5	Dr. Johns and his staff are wonderful! They are always helpful, kind and thorough. Most doctor's offices try to push you out the door--but not this one! Also, the office is always clean. Overall the best GP I've ever had.
