5	Jerry was fantastic!  My carpets look brand new.  He is not only a professional but friendly and nice.  He gave me a very fair price and helped get rid of terrible pet stains.  I couldn't be happier.  Also everyone with the company is very nice and helpful.  Highly recomend.
5	Professional, Courteous and knowledgable. I have had First Choice clean my carpets numerous times and there is no other business I would give my money to. If you want your carpets done right then First Choice is your only choice.
5	Very glad I had them clean my carpet. They equipment they use is first rate. Superior to other services I've used. Fair price and professional service. Keep up the good work Jerry! I will be a repeat customer.
5	Jerry is as stand up as they come. Very professional, punctual, explains the process in detail, great prices and you will receive the best customer service by Jerry, his wife, and his crew. First Choice Carpet & Tile Care is the ONLY company I will ever use or recommend!
5	First Choice Carpet Is aptly named. This is a highly professional, licensed, company. They arrived on time and did an outstanding job on our rugs at a reasonable price. Their rotary machine did a far better job than the companies who have used wand scrubbers that we've had in the past. This company should be your First Choice when your carpets need cleaning.
