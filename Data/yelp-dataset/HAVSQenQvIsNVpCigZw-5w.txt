3	Why am I reviewing a chain pizza place? It was only a few years ago now that I was so desperate for marinara sauce that I wandered into Pizza Nova and requested a panzarotti . The biggest suprise? It was good. Actually, quite good. I can't speak to the quality of the pizza but this is one of the best spots in the plaza.

4	Franchise pizzas get such a bad rep, I don't quite understand it at all. They're really not that bad. Whenever I crave pizza (not that often), I always go to Pizza Nova. I don't really go for the deals because I know specifically how I want my pizza. Therefore, I can't speak for the pre-cooked pizzas that have been sitting around for a few hours waiting for people to come and sweep them away at a low price. I CAN speak for the customized pizzas though. I always order online and pick them up in 20 minutes or so. The pizza is usually done a little earlier, and is piping hot! Certain ingredients are yummier than others, like porchetta, but the most important thing is just knowing how to match the right stuff together. I've had their wings and lasagna before, but didn't like them as much as the pizza. Get the pizza :)
