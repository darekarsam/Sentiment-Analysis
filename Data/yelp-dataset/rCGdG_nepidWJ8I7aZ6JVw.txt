4	For around $10, you can get a delicious burger 'trois fromages' with a copious amount of excellent fries. Dine-in, friendly service. Who could say no to that? If this place gets a makeover - right now it has a look that can be best described as awkward - I bet more people would be enticed to come in and come back. Their burgers are honestly good and the fries could compete with the those in the major league of fries: Frites Alors, La Banquise, Chez Claudette, etc. They also have a nice variety of mayonnaise for the fries.Seriously, apart from the look, I dig this place and had I not moved away from Verdun,  I would still be a regular.
