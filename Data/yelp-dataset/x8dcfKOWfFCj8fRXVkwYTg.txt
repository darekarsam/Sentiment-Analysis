5	I needed a truck today to move a few bigger items. I went online last night to set up my reservation for today at noon. Picking up the truck was quick and efficient. Allan, the manager, also let me know the easiest place to refill the gas before dropping off the truck which worked out well.Everything went as plan, no high pressure up selling of products and services. I did choose to take the insurance for the day. My total cost was very reasonable. I will be using this location again for any truck rental needs. Well worth the price and convenience.
1	If All Storage Las Vegas is anything like their associated site in Encinitas, do not rent here.  Their security system doesn't work.  Our unit in Encinitas was broken in and they did not follow up on the alarm (on a weekday at 2 pm!) nor could they provide any video to the police (hard drive crash).  We lost lots of good things and they didn't seem to care.  Read the entire story here http://www.724network.com/All%20Storage/index.html
5	Very nice and professional here, we've rented a u-haul here, and now have a storage unit. Have had zero issues so far, will update if otherwise.
4	Mike was extremely helpful and a very nice guy. He definitely takes pride in his work. I was helped immediately and was out in about 10 min. I got the van only $20 plus $10 for damage fees and 59 cents a mile. All around I'd say it's was a great experience because it was hassle free.
