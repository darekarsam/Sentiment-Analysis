1	Bought a groupon for dental cleaning because I haven't had one for 2 years, the cleaning was very light and ended shortly after it started. I would have given them 3 stars, but the staff obviously doesn't care for their patients, because I have now called 3 times over the past month to request a record of my X-ray be sent to my email (so it's 100% cost free to them) and have gotten NO response. I even obtained their email address on the phone (so I know it's the right one) and emailed my request, still nothing. It seems to me like they're purposely delaying my request to prevent me from seeking dental services from other providers, and that's just wrong coming from a medical establishment.  Guess I'll have to call every other day to get some attention. Until they email me my record, I'm not changing their rating. Avoid this place if you want to be treated like a human being.
3	So I finally got my x-ray after 4 phone calls. Hooray!  I wish I had better things to say...
3	The dental hygienists were actually pretty good and thorough when I went. The bitch at the front desk is pretty rude tho
5	I purchased a groupon cleaning/xrays for $40 bucks and it was as good as a visit could get for $40 bucks. I was pleasantly surprised that I had no cavities when another dentist told me I had "lots of shadows due to years of soda or other sugary/acidic beverage."  I made another appointment 6 months down the road for another $40 buck!   It's a great deal!
