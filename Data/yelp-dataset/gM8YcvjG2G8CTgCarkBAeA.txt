1	Terrible restaurant. The "General Manager" was a complete idiot. 2 employees were involved in a very loud Verbal altercation and the boss did not care or even seem to take notice :/  They needed to change the Diet Dr Pepper but were to lazy. The girl said she did not know how and the manager turned around and said "we are out"--they were not out cuz the other girl went back and checked. This is easily one of the worst Carl's that I have ever been to; what a waste of money.
1	This is the worse Carl's Jr restaurant I have ever been to. --The drive through speaker is low volume. The manager has been saying since it opened "we are going to fix it soon" But it never gets fixed.--Three times within a month the wait in car line was excessive. Sometimes reaching as long as 7 minutes waiting for the person to take my order. There is hardly a wait to get in line because I guess people are starting to hate the bad service. But imagine when you get to the speaker and the person asks you to wait and you do...for 7+ mins!--The manager and district manager have been called by me two times and still they do NOTHING to correct the simplest of problems. I have just gotten used to driving to the Carl's on W Craig. At least there the staff knows how to run a restaurant. To bad too because this one is closer to the house.
1	Worse Carls Jr ever, what ever genius opened this spot didn't hire the right people!TERRIBLE SERVICE!! I'll NEVER come back here! I'd rather eat at the chevron and get food poisoning! At least the staff is nice and friendly there! Terrible CJs!!
