3	Martinis in a bowling alley bar? But Pockets Bar & Grille is more than simply a bowling alley bar, hence the reason it is getting it's own listing. The bowling center's chic lounge, located inside Gilbert's new Brunswick XL, features a bevy of martinis such as the Chocolate Ecstasy, Cocorumtini or Georgia Peach, which range from $6.50 to $7.50.There's six pool tables and plush red sofas. Black-and-white photos of old-school bowling decorate the walls. The lounge also features three flat-screen TVs.Gilbert doesn't have a lot of nightlife options but this cool lounge is fun surprise. It reminds me of  LA's Pinz or Lucky Strike.
5	Pockets is the nicest bowling alley lounge evah!My date and I went out the night before the 4th of July and we stopped at three other bars before coming here, they were all packed.  I remembered how large this bar was and how it seemed to be dead so I suggested we come here.  It turned out to be an excellent spot for a date.  Great selection of beers on tap.  Our bartender was solid!  She overheard us talking about "frickles" (fried pickles) and said they were her favorite thing on the menu so we tried them, they were surprisingly delicious.  We split a pitcher and then headed to the game room - we laughed the entire time.  So much fun!
5	You would be surprised by how much fun adults can have at Pockets in the Brunswick Zone XL!  Great food, clean, fresh felt pool tables, sticks that are not warped and have good tips.  Lots of big screen TVs that can be seen wherever you sit. Three projector screens.  And on the weekend live entertainment, bands like rock hogs, karaoke on Saturday with Starz Karaoke.  Great tasting food, cold drinks. And no kids after 9, grown ups can be grown ups. This is not the typical bowling ally lounge, it's much much more!
