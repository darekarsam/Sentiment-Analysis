5	I'm very satisfied with my garage cabinets. My garage looks great. The  designer who came to my house was the guy who put them in.  I received 3 quotes from 3 different garage companies. Even though Neils was not the lowest it was nice to know that they were going to be done properly. I also liked the fact that they came with a lifetime warranty. Not many companies offered this.
5	My parents got their garage redone by Neil's and since they are kind of "old" and don't believe in Yelp, so I had to leave a review myself. They're garage is AWESOME!! It used to be so cluttered and we're talking 50+ years of just "crap" laying around and so disorganized. Now, everything has a place and everything in it's place, totally great workmanship and the workers were very friendly and treated my parents with respect and excellent customer service. Worth the money and the time, it ended up fantastic!!!
