3	The first part of my little Montreal jaunt was for work, and this is our company's negotiated hotel.  So though I would have preferred something more exciting, the Quality it was.  At first glance, I was dubious.  The hotel decor is extremely dated and shabby and the hotel itself is in a not so great area.  I got up to my room and did my standard inspection/strip down of the beds (I've become a total paranoid freak about bedbugs.  Don't judge.) and I have to give the hotel credit, everything is immaculate.  The rooms are scrupulously clean.  Overall, the hotel is totally serviceable and totally unexceptional.  I will say the staff was very nice and provided us with some pretty good restaurant recommendations within walking distance.  I would caution you to avoid the hotel restaurant, "Graffiti's" at all costs.  We had breakfast there every morning (I was advocating for Tim Horton's, but lost out to my coworker who had the car.  Hmph.) which was standard issue, overpriced hotel stuff.  Car-having coworker also subjected me to dinner there one night and it was horrendous.  I had a feeling, based on breakfast, that dinner would be less than great so I ordered a pizza, figuring that'd be hard to screw up.  No dice, it was so awful I couldn't finish it.  AND I think it was something like $14.  Thank goodness that meal's going on the expense report...
3	Good hotel. Nothing special or fancy but very clean and very friendly staff.Restaurant is completely overpriced. Food is so so. Menu has not changed since at least 7 month (could be longer).
4	4 star for 3 star price. The beds are really good and the staff is very friendly. Good place for short business stays.
