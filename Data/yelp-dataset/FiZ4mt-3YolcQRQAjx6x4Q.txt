1	They're too busy to provide good, personal care.  I had knee problems that was diagnosed as Osteoarthritis.  I received a injections that supposedly would work for a minimum of 3 years.  3 days later I waa unable to walk again.  I waited a week to see if it would fix itself.  When I did schedule an appointment they couldn't take me for 3 weeks.Since then I've gone to 3 appoinments, each time waiting for at least an hour AFTER my scheduled appointment time to see someone and nothing was accomplished.They finally got the OK from the insurance company to do injections.  I arrived early.  30 minutes after my scheduled appointment they put me in a small exam room with nothing but a very uncomfortable stool to sit on where I waited for another hour until I finally had enough and walked out.  The little bit of business they lost from me is insignificant, because the waiting room was FULL when I was leaving.  They really need to concentrate more on providing quality service to the existing patients before taking on new ones.
2	I waited 2 hours to get to the first exam room even though I showed up 15 minutes early for my appt. Another 20 after that before the tech came into the room. 30 minutes to take X-rays, and another 30 minute wait to see the doctor, who was a bit arrogant. The diagnosis was correct, and it was nice that X-rays were done in the office, but overall I don't think I would come back. I don't have 1/2 a day for every appt.
1	Once again they are 45 minutes late. This place is ridiculous They are also remarkably disorganized If you have a choice AVOID DOC!!!!!!!
