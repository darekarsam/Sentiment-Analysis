5	I am a patient of Dr. Andersen and he is amazing! Had surgery on my foot and the scar is barely noticeable; he answers any/all questions I have and is not rushing out of the room. Office staff is always super helpful, professional, and polite. Very friendly and understanding. I would highly recommend this practice to anyone in need of podiatry work.
4	I went here once, but that was all it took, apparently. My feet had been hurting me so I went in to see what was up. This place is right by the hospital in San Tan Valley so it's a great location to those in this little more of a remote area. The Doctor, can't remember which one, came in asked some questions, did some tests/x-rays and gave me the skinny on what the felt was going on, I was there for less than a hour. Doc gave me a prescription and my feet have not bothered me since and I have stopped taking the medicine.The only thing I didn't like and I didn't factor it into the review because I know it can't always be helped was that they billed me after the appointment, I hate receiving a bill in the mail because of an unforeseen cost the insurance won't cover, but like I said, I did not factor that into the review because it is a very common occurrence with many medical offices.
5	I've been to see Dr Newswander several times and I was able to be seen on time, never made me wait. His service from a health standpoint was exceptional. He was able to give me options and also was clear what treatment he thought would be best. He even came in late on a Friday night to help my daughter with her toe. Bottom line, above and beyond!! Thank you Dr Brad!!
