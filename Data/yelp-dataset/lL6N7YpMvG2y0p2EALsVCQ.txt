5	Title Management Company is Arizona is the only title company I use. I have been in the business for many years and have closed deals with numerous title companies throughout Arizona. I was never loyal and always tried to "spread the wealth" when a new title person asked me for their business. That all stopped when I met Laura Rodriguez, Kathy Zobel, and Irma Ragsdale. I like to refer to them as the Dream Team of Title Agencies! As an agent that has adjusted to the market, I understand how important it is to have a team that understands the process of a short sale. The HUD turn around time cannot be beat, and I have to double-handedly give credit to Kathy and Irma for negotiating with the short sale lenders' investor for 5 hours on the close of escrow date to get the deal done and closed. It would have fallen apart without them and they made me look like a rockstar to my clients! When times are tough and expertise is what matters, these are the ladies you should trust. Communication is so important in a real estate transaction and they understand that. No matter how expensive the sale, every client is treated with the upmost courtesy and professionalism. There are no hidden fees and I challenge you to find better service for lower rates!Laura Rodriguez is their marketing rep and has over 20 years of experience helping Realtors build their business through marketing, branding and and prospecting. She gives you great ideas on how to market properties and self advertisement and she's always open to thinking outside the box. Don't waste time working with people who don't take their job or your business seriously. Title Management Company will exceed your expectations and I promise once you switch, you won't go back!
