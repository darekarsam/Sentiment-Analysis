5	I thought it would be a good idea to have a brick patio in front of my salon. You know, a place to put a table ...couple of chairs.  I talked to the guys at Stone Creations and they got right on it. I had no idea the amount of work involved in creating a stone patio! Bricks were cut, there was some sorta tapping machine involved, sand was laid- More tapping.  It was quite a production. It looks beautiful! Also they have an outdoor showroom at their location so you can browse any time you want. I like to pop over there occasionally just to see the new types of stone they're carrying.
5	A friend recommended John Traynor to put pavers in our backyard.  We couldn't be happier with the results!  We had no idea that so much prep was involved in putting down pavers, but we hadn't considered drainage, leveling and such.  The guys literally worked 3 solid days before a paver was even laid down.  Our backyard always had really poor drainage (especially during the big monsoons) and now it's amazing.  It was a side benefit I never even thought about from getting pavers installed.  The crew was polite, hard working and always cleaned up nicely every day when they left.  And John actually made some design suggestions that were perfect for our project.  Once again, stuff we hadn't even thought about.  I HIGHLY recommend John Traynor and his guys at Stone Creations.
5	I had a paver patio put in about 4 yrs ago and it started caving in & the company that installed it wouldn't come back to even look at it.  Stone Creations was recommended to me and I couldn't have asked for a better company to repair the faulty job the previous company did.  John Traynor was so nice and understanding and pulled up all the pavers and took out all the old dirt & brought in new dirt & cement & put the pavers back and it looks brand new again!!I have recommended Stone Creations to many of my friends & neighbors!Thank you John Traynor and crew!!
