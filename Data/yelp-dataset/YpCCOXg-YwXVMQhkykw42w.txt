1	If you are looking for a Young Israel, keep looking. This Kiruv centric,  Aish Shul is great for a weekend or two but don't move to this side of the city if you are Modern O or more observant, you'll get frustrated fast.
5	My wife and I for years have done little more than to light candles on Hanukkah (and each Chinese food on 12/25). However, after meeting Rabbi Wyne in a coffee shop one day, we agreed to check out Young Israel. We were nervous, but over a year later we find ourselves increasingly observant, looking for a home near the shul, and finding our Jewish identity after all these years. If you had told me a year ago that I would have even flirted with Orthodox Judaism, I would have laughed at you. But the shul was so warm, welcoming, and reserves no judgement for where you are in your spirituality. There are folks of every stripe here. Outreach and education are high on their list, and they just want all Jews to know more about where they come from. Just give it a try and you'll see what I mean.
5	The BEST Modern Orthodox shul in Vegas! They have so much constantly going on! It  one of the only communities in vegas that get everyone invovled. From the hebrew school programing, to NCSY Teen, and even adult learning nights. The best thing is the community BBQs! Yummmm! Love Rabbi Wyne, he has so much patience and hes very inspirational and understanding!
5	A very friendly Temple not full of people in Black Hats, just a bunch of very wise ones that will take you as you are and more great Spiritual Moments to appreciate and share with the person sitting next to you.We all need an amount of G-d choose your dose.
