2	I wasn't sure what to order so I ordered  one of my favorite side dishes. Mac and cheese. I was extremely disappointed it was very dry and bland. It cost almost 4 bucks im really glad I didn't get more i really was hoping that it was good.  The portion was a good amount , just lacking taste and cheese.
2	Have eaten here twice and both times were a big disappointment. First time was for shrimp and fries - standard deep fried stuff and nothing special. I tried again and had the pulled pork with two sides - mac & cheese and the greens. The greens were the best thing on the plate which has to be one of the most disappointing statements one could make. The mac and cheese was dry and as bland as anything. The pulled pork was a disaster. The appearance should have been warning enough - unappetizing looking slop. The taste? I am sure there was pork in there as I got a very faint hint of smokiness from time to time. However, other than a somewhat stringy texture amongst the overwhelming flavor of sugar it could have been anything. Did I mention the overly sweet sugar taste? That was all you got. Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar. I only ate half because it was just impossible to continue eating. And all that for $9Such a shame
