5	I can't even begin to say just how much I value OSR. All of the therapists and staff there have been great. I had a very long rehab after very involved shoulder (rotator cuff) surgery and it went perfectly; just the right pace for me and with tons of personal attention. I'm now having surgery on the other shoulder and while I can't say I'm looking forward to the surgery or the rehab, I know that the process will result in a perfectly healed and functional joint instead of the painful and partially immobilized condition that I'm in today.What I really appreciate at OSR, apart from the personal attention, is the real commitment to education displayed from top to bottom. My therapist, Mike Beebe is a prime example of this. Not only does Mike have a doctorate in physical therapy, he also teaches at the university level, works with the local high school sports programs, and made absolutely sure that I knew what was being done and why. I learned more about human biology from Mike than I ever expected to know!No one can say that physical therapy for an injury or surgical recovery is something we look forward to. However, at OSR I received top level care, made friends and learned about my body and how to better care for it. I couldn't have asked for more and I know that the second time around will lead to as good a result for the other shoulder.
5	I have used OSR a few times for rehab. on broken bones and after knee operations.  Very professional and courteous staff.
5	I have severe degenerative arthritis in my hands.  After finding out that OSR has a hand specialist on staff I made an appointment.. What a difference a professional caring therapist makes.  I am pain free for the first time in years and follow the methods taught to keep that way.  I have recommended several friends and family members, something I rarely do.  Keep up the good work OSR - how wonderful.
