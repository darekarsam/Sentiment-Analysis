4	Fresh seafood brought in daily for you to select.  They will even fry it for you while you wait!  The fish plates might just be the BEST in Charlotte!  Mrs. Kim's homemade tartar sauce makes the meal!!
4	I had gone to this place several years ago, but totally forgot about it.  They offer fresh seafood and will clean it up for you to take home or they will fry it up for you, the choice is yours.  I had a croaker plate with fries/slaw/pickles/bread.  It was very good, and I will be going back!
4	This is probably the best fried fish that I've had since moving to Charlotte. I'm from NY, and fish markets that also sell cooked food are the norm... this is comparable. I had the fried whiting plate, and it was perfect. I am particular about coleslaw, so I didn't eat mine but the fish and fries were good enough to make me go back there for dinner TONIGHT.
