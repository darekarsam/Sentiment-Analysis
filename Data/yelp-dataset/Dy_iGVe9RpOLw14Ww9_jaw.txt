4	One of the best Mexican restaurants I've had by far. The atmosphere is friendly, the service as well, and the food is filling (plus delicious!) We had the mixed appetizer which included chicken tacos, some kind of mini pizzas, guacamole, and beans. For the main we shared steak and cheese tacos. It came with onions. coriander and lime. So flavorful!! Their tortilla soup is also a must try. There is a mini grocery store in the restaurant, you can buy hot sauces and other condiments/items. Price is relatively reasonable and the waitresses were very confident about the quality of their food. They have every right to because it was amazing. Apparently the chefs have been working there for years and years so they consistently make good food.If you're into authentic Mexican food, try this joint. (I'm positive it is authentic).
4	Something about temperatures in the -30s makes me crave Mexican, call me crazy, and this Montrealer's quest for authentic eats of this ethnicity is endless so when I saw Shirley's review I bookmarked it and headed east. I can second that the service was super friendly and chill and the food was delicious - I had a green salsa vegetarian dish that was dreamy and spicy and good. The decor is casual, but not too brightly lit and grocery-store-esque as at Roi du Taco. The tv is on and the Latin American families tucked into the booths seem happy. Will return for sure.
