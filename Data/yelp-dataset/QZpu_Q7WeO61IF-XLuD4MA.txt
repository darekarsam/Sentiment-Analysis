4	Its what you expect of a Military bank. Friendly employees and no lines. They helped me get cash and i was on my way rather quickly.
3	I really like this bank too, I come in here to buy the money orders to pay my son's tuition. The staff is always prompt and wonderful, and they remember my name!
1	called the customer service to close my lost secured credit card because also I was charged an undisclosed fee of 25 bucks annually. Neither the branch or cust service was able to help me and now they're sending me a new card so I can come to branch and close it. What ?
