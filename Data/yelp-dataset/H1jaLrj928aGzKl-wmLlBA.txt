4	The Peluso Bonisoir is just a regular Bonisoir up front, but keep going. In the back the beer rows begin and there are suddenly wood floors and walls of fridges where you can find everything cold and organized by brewer. On the floor you can browse by flavour profile which is a kind and friendly way to introduce you to beers you might like but have never tried. This beer heaven is kind of off the beaten path for most Plateau-ites but there's a bonus if you venture here, you are right next to the old Montreal Pool Room. Yum.
4	Huge selection of Quebec beer, good prices, knowledgable staff. Always a great place to wander the aisles and pick up a few interesting beers. They also sell glasses, shirts, and hot sauce made with beer for the beer fanatic in your life.  Just a word of warning though - if you're looking for American craft beer, or even craft beer from the rest of Canada, you won't be able to find it here. Nor will you be able to find it anywhere in this province.
5	Simply, the best beer dep in the city. Helpful staff and great selection. Not exactly cheap but great overall
