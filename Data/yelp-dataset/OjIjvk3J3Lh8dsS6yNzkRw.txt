2	If you are ever unfortunate enough to either take a class on the engineering quad or have to study in Granger...the odds are that you need caffeine...lots of caffeine. While Espresso Royale rules the LAS campus, Bevande now rules engineering. This one is in the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory and the other is in Siebel Center. Bevande has lots of coffee, some of it shade-grown organic. I like their smoothies, but their pastries seem a little less than fresh. They also have sandwiches to order, which are better than Royale's, but that isn't saying much.
5	ok, i'm biased because i am an adict and i live, oops, i mean work in the siebel center where this is located.  but the truth of the matter is this: i travel constantly for work and pleasure, i've tasted the best coffees in the world, and this stuff works for me.  it's better than starbucks, similar to peet's, almost as good as illy just to give you a commercial perspective.  i love the fact that i don't even need to speak to get what i want.  as soon as they see you coming, they start making your usual.  it's not just me either, i've watched many people get the silent treatment...which is exactly what you want when you are deep in conversation with an exciting computer scientist.  but just in case you have time to chat...they are a delightful bunch and the manager jane even gives great fashion advice...one more thing to feel guilty about being in the most gorgeous computer science building in the country.
