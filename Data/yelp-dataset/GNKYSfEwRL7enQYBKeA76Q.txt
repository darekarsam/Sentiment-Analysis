4	Awesome place for spicy food when your in the mood, try the sliced pork with chili, so good . It was closed down and they had the best twice cooked pork , then reopened, they have most of the same stuff, but if you love spicy then this is the place, small cozy and good authentic food.
2	This place needs help. I've only been here once but was not impressed at all. Prices were high. Quality was low. Rice is extra although the girl at the front gave to me a little for no charge. She was sweet but I don't even know if she understood what I said. Not really that tasty either. It looked like only relatives were the ones eating there. The kid said they bought from the old owners and also that the chef that stayed from the old place was let go recently even after staying with the new owners. The menu is a little complicating. Just very plain and the headings and the items were the same font which makes it hard to discern between the different categories. Wow! I should really be an adviser. So many places I go to that I could help with only a few small changes. But, no one thinks I know what I'm talking about.
