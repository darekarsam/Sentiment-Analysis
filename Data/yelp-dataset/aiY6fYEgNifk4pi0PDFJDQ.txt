5	Had a great experience with this company!.    My door wouldn't open and my car was stuck in the garage.  The girl on the phone was very knowledgable and quickly helped me determine that my spring was broken.  The tech, Chuck, arrived within an hour replaced the spring oiled my door .  Before when I opened the door it was extremely noisy.  I can't believe how much smoother it runs now.  I would recommend this company..
5	Bryan was fast and did a perfect job.
