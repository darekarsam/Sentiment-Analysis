5	I went here for lunch with my hubby, and we loved it! Large but comfortable, great waitress, and my Rib Eye sandwich, amazing! Awesome onion rings, great beers on tap. Go!
1	I live less than a mile from this establishment and have frequented the previous businesses as we can walk there.  I am a long timer in the restaurant industry and know that every one has bad days.  I always give a place a second or third try. Unfortunately once was enough for me and Ziggy's.  long story short I ordered a strip steak MR. I explained to my waiter that I will not eat a steak that is cooked to medium or over and if the kitchen was to make an error to please err on the side of rare.  The steak came to me cooked to MWell. I asked the waiter to please ask the kitchen to give it another shot for medium rare.  Once again the steak came out significantly overlooked. The waiter realized that there was a problem as my husband was almost done with his so so food and I had yet to start and asked his manager to stop by our table. The mgr asked if I would like to order something else (at this point my husband was finished) I declined.   Knowing that this wasn't the waiters fault we left our normal 20% tip and continued out the door. I am sure that everyone has experienced this situation - what was different this time was the manager follows us out the door yelling at us!!!  WHAT?  Your kitchen could not cook a steak and I'm leaving hungry and you are yelling at me?  Enough said!   We are looking forward to the next incarnation when Ziggy's closes.
5	Great food and great wait staff
