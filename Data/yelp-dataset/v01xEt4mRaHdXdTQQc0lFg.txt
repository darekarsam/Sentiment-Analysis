5	Why why why can't this chain come West from Quebec? The Sports Cage? Why not??? Big dinner out... baby back ribs from god.... kids got mini hot dogs in blankets with fries... and everybody was happy... but the big draw is the onion block. For under $5 you can get a block the size of a pound of butter of battered deep fried mushed together caramelized sweet onions. Don't believe me? Check the picture and weep my kittens. On my recent tour of the home stomping grounds, La Cage onion block was on the list.... check.
4	I love Cage au Sport for their amazing chicken wings and popcorn! This is almost a new restaurant, its been around for about 2 year. Come here on Game night, and be amazed with all the screens, and sirens going off. It's quite a show when our home team wins!The food is quite hot, so you know it has not been waiting in a food warmer. The burgers are nice and juicy. The initial service is slow especially on game night due to the large clientele. If you had over populated restaurants, and very noisy locations avoid coming here on game night, you will regret it.
