5	Great staff! They have always helped me whenever I have trouble with something and they give their best efforts every time. Clean layout and store, and caring, friendly staff.
2	This walmart never seems to have anything. When I go to other walmarts I am surprised by all the things they offer. It is very clean and friendly staff.
3	I like this one... not too hectic for a Superstore, and, well, it's super...
2	Its Walmart. As far as Walmarts go it is very clean inside and out. That is a plus compared to most locations I've been too. I'd still much prefer we had something else in our community, but it is what it is. If they ever start treating their employees better then I would consider giving them more stars, but they continue to pay their employees low wages and offer them little to no benefits.
5	The photo department was super helpful and went out of their way to help save me some money I my prints.
1	Ok.  They gave declined.  Lines 7 and 8 deep. Workers not moving and blocking aisles.  When I used self check and an error came up it took 5 minutes to get help.  Not good.
1	I normally wouldn't leave a reviw for a Walmart but the service in this place was so horrendous that I had to tell people about it. I saw the customer service lady treat a spanic lady in thee most rude way.. When I had enough I asked to speak to the manager and I was denied.. They said that he wouldn't be back until the next day..I called to complain the next morning and when I called they would transfer my call and nobody would ever pick up..
2	An elderly cashier named Penny works here and she is the most bitter old woman I have ever met. She is a fugly slut. Do not trust her.
