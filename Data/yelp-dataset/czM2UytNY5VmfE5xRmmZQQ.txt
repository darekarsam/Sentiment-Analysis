2	They get 2 stars because of the employee not there prices. She was very helpful and happy. But 22.00 for 1 box small bag of packing peanuts and very small roll of tape. What a ripoff.
5	I came here to have a document notarized.  Only cost $2.  No wait so it went quickly.  Beware of the weekends here.  If you like to wait in line come on the weekends.  If not, after 4 is always a good time.  The lady who helped me today was really nice and I got a free pen!  Love free stuff ;)
5	I really like this UPS location . Everyone here is so friendly and patient. As I write this review I can see their smiles on their happy faces. I know these guys sometimes have some rough days but they always seem like some cool folks. This location is just off the 303 freeway near the Albertsons grocery store.
