5	So my parents finally kicked me off of their policy and I had to start my own. This was a little scary- I've never done insurance-y things before! This office has been PHENOMINAL! They are constantly figuring out ways to get me better deals while maintaining excellent coverage. They have never made me feel stupid or uncomfortable. I really appreciate that! On top of it all, I got a bomb swag bag when I left the first time! Highly recommend!
5	My brother purchased a new and first car today and was shopping for insurance the last couple of days and was not getting a good quote being a new driver. Literally on way to the dealership he called Sharon for his auto insurance and Sharon Not only came up with great coverage but also a terrific premiumEasy straight forward and professionalHighly recommended !
5	The staff here is friendly, professional, and knowledgeable.  I highly recommend them.
