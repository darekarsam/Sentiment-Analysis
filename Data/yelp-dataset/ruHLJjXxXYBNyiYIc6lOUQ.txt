4	If you've been to any Crafts Sales or burlesque events in Montreal you may have met Nikki Bundy, proprietress of Bake Sale Girl, hawking her exceedingly sinful cupcakes. This astonishing lady also creates cakes to order that are way too good to be true and so people tend to take pictures of them before they disappear in a chorus of nomnomnom. Her icings and fillings are perfection. Her red-velvet cupcakes should be illegal and her chocolate-mojito has, deservedly, won an award. Should you want to order any of her wares (and you should) please remember that this is a one-woman business and give her ample time to prepare. I could happily eat her cupcakes and other desserts every week but it would spoil me for anyone else.
5	Sooooooo goooood! Triple threat chocolate & mohito are my faves. Oatmeal cookies are also delish. The products are always fresh, and there is actually a great focus on flavour - not just pretty decorations. Highly recommended!
5	If I could marry a cupcake, I would and it would be the simple, trustworthy vanilla cupcake with the most perfect icing and sprinkles on top, nom nom. Top notch ingredients, made with love and the fluffiest, most perfect cake-base ever. I have never had a better cupcake in my life and I am already contemplating what to order for my birthday in July!
