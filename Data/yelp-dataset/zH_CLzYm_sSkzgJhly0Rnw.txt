4	L'Mage Studios have 3 locations, the one off of the 101 and Ray is their 3rd and newest. The location is beautiful and brand new. I love the layout of multiple little personally owned studios in one building. They have a common area for the hair driers but mostly it is like a small community of hair dressers/stylists, masseurs, etc. My girl is Kelly at Suite 109 Salon and I love her! I started with Kelly a few years ago at a different salon and followed her to L'mage.I love the small salon feel of the place and the convenient communication directly with your stylist so you can make an appointment that works for both of your schedules.
1	I have been a stylist for quite a few years now and have a few friends who rent from this location and a couple others. The places are pretty and decorated nice, but the drama prohibited me from leasing....the owner is sleazy and dates his tenants. He has one of them pregnant too. My husband said NO WAY.
