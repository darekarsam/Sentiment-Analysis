4	The good people of Vinyasa looked after us very well and couldn't have been more attentive. Menu suggestions were well judged and the food was excellent. They're relatively new, but have created a lovely family run restaurant in the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town. I had lamb, which I often do with Indian food, and it was lovely - tender and full of flavour.
5	My wife and I ate here while on our honeymoon, and we loved it! The waitstaff was exceedingly friendly and helpful and the food was terrific. My wife has a serious nut allergy that extends to chickpeas and lentils. which make Indian food difficult. But the manager at Vinyasa went out of his way to help us find some dishes that were completely safe and delicious. If you are looking for great Indian food, in a well run restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere, I highly recommend Vinyasa!
4	We booked online and they provided us a 15% discount which was a welcome surprise! The atmosphere was pleasant and modern and the food was great as well. On a Saturday around 1230pm they only had one other table, so reservations were not necessary. Not sure if they are much busier for dinner but as a result the service was good and the food came out quickly. We had some delicious curries which were rich and flavorful and had just the right amount of heat. meat samosa deep fried savoury pastries with minced lamb served witha special sauce and accompanied with saladgarlic naanbread stuffed with coriander and garlic cooked in our clay oventikka massalam with chickenkebabs cooked in a mild flavoured sauce with herbs and spicesbhuna with chickentraditional medium strength dish cooked with onions, herbs, tomatoes and a variety of spicestarka dhallentils served with a touch of garlic
5	Vinyasa is charming and elegant without being pretentious. Staff is friendly. But the food......the food.....oh my, the food......some of the best indian food I have had......and I've had a lot. Full marks for Vinyasa.
