5	I was very impressed with the quality and condition of the baby equipment I rented from them. Everything looked brand new.  Everything was delivered and picked up at no charge which was a real plus.  Great customer service and very courteous.  I was a little hesitant at first to have everything delivered sight unseen, however, everything was great!  I will definitely use them again when the need arises.
5	We rented a crib from Anything for Baby during a visit to Phoenix. The whole process was a breeze - they emailed me back to next day to confirm. Best of all they offer a drop-off/pick-up so we were able to have the crib waiting when we arrived, and they came to get it after we left. More time for vacation! Super friendly. Excellent quality crib, mattress and sheets. Highly recommended!
5	I rented their package of 6 items for when my sister, niece and nephew were visiting. They dropped everything off at my front door and picked it up when we were done.  It was so easy! The quality of the rentals were good and everything came very clean. I would definitely use again for visiting friends and relatives!
