5	Well lets see... as of now, everything is new and set up in store well... annnnddd the best part is no one knows its here yet! You really can't beat it. Hoping it stays this way. Store is a super center so you can find their food department here as well. Great job on the construction end- store looks great both inside and outside. Otherwise, typical Walmart.
4	Nice and new. Not to crowded for a Walmart. I hope it stays that way. 4 stars because they were out of the microwave bulb I was looking for.
5	Nice new Walmart that has yet to be discovered by most people. Interesting self checkout section and I love the convenience since it is on the way home from work.
5	My new favorite walmart! Reasons why I love this Walmart:-Super clean. The produce looks delicious, floor sets organized, clothing presentable, etcetera.-Self checkout... Enough said-it's NEVER extremely crowded. The parking lot usually looks more crowded than it actually is inside -Staff is friendly -Subway inside! -better product availability-feel safer visiting at night by myself I work near this Walmart and I choose to get items from here instead of bothering to go to the one on Tryon even though it's closer to my apartment.
