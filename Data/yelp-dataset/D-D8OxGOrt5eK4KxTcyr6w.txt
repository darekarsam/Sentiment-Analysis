4	Friendly service. The food looks fresh and tasty. They get you in and out quite quickly. Clean establishment.  They also have a few tables to sit at or you can carry it out. They also cater.
5	I really like this subway! They are all very nice. Everytime I go in I see someone cleaning, which makes me feel confident that the restaurant is hygienic. They aren't stingy with the veggies which I love! I make the choice to come here instead of the other subway down the street.
5	Had the Philly cheese stake sandwich. It was all right .am so full right now ! Lol  The customer service great no hassle on how we wanted the sandwiches . The employee was friendly .
5	Stopped in at subway for a cheap bite not expecting much... But this location was clean the food was fresh and staff was friendly!!
5	The 21 year old girl behind the counter deserves her own franchise today!!! I have eaten here many times over a two year period and she is nothing but smiles and very pro subway..She can make anybody's day happy whether the food is good or not...she is a good example of how a restaurant should treat its clients or customers upon arrival of their own restaurant...Subway executives please give her that location she is unbelievably the best customer service I've had other than running my own business...
4	It is open 24 hours in a city that is 24 the service is great with them greeting you at the door. The food is made quick and to order.
