5	While staying at Harrah's I was glad to have decent pizza right downstairs. It's comparable to Sbarro and about $3 a slice. I ate here more often than anywhere else while in Vegas, which says more about me than this place but still.
1	The guy who took my order was nice but when he made a mistake on my order (after asking my specifications), the guy had the nerve to say/ask, "what do you want me to do about it?" Common sense says u don't talk to your customers like that seeing how  it was your error.
1	This is a NY pizza by the slice place in the "food court" next to Harrahs. You also have the option of Chipotle, Panda Express, or McDonalds. I chose pizza because the others had long lines, but immediately regretted my decision when I was charged almost $7 for a (mushroom and pepperoni) slice only slightly larger than normal. I could have bought a whole Chipotle burrito for that price. They warmed up the slice and I ate it, but it tasted average. You can bet that next time, I will choose to wait in line for another restaurant to get a better value for my money.
