2	At a school like CMU, I am shocked that this place hasn't been reviewed yet! In any case, Entropy is the school convenience store, located in the University (student) Center. Actually, there's nothing special here. It's a convenience store and it's very expensive. This is due to the fact its on campus and has a monopoly on these things. The only things I bought here are bottles of water and mini-servings of Ben & Jerry's ice cream. I heard once (though it may be total B.S.) that cigarette sales accounting for 60% of all revenue here. That would be sad if it were true.
2	Nothing special.  CMU's main convenience store.  Better for packaged goods than anything resembling a meal. Nice outdoor seating though.
1	Very expensive, take the time to go somewhere else and you'll save a ton of money. Everything is marked up at least 100%.
