5	Bucket list stuff, saguaros and horses, miles of trails, a must do! thanks Joe for fun and calming those first time riders
5	I have been riding with Patty for years. She is a great horse trainer and people trainer! She is serious about safety and fun. I have seen her lead all types of riders, even a blind one who loved his ride. She is a truly talented cowgirl. The views are outstanding, the horses well trained and the experience a 5 star! A great way to entertain guests.
