5	As a property manager we use Davis plumbing all of the time for our jobs and we are very pleased with their service. Most of the time we can get them out the very same day to the job and it is fixed in a matter of minutes. We never have to worry about a thing as long as they are sent to the job.
5	Woke up to a leak in the water main to my house on a Sunday morning.  By noon Davis Plumbing had it repaired and I was on to my afternoon of relaxing.    Very reasonable in pricing, nice repairman.  Life is good!
5	I just used Davis Plumbing for my new home purchase and they were, once again, incredibly receptive, I actually got same day service, and Kirk (the owner) and his son are super honest and very fair. This is a great family business; real home town feel with their customer service and attentiveness. I wish all businesses were this good.
