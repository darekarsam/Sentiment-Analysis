4	We came here around 7pm on a Friday, 30 mins before they close. One of the worker said, they still take customers so we are happy that they welcomed us. I got mani/pedi here for $50 with gel polished in my manicure; I had two workers doing each part-- one for manicure and one for pedicure. Both of them did well cleaning my nails, I didn't really get hurt or anything. They first acknowledge on which color I wanted for my mani/pedi, I got purple nail polished. They asked me again on which color I wanted right before they put it on my nails. The ladies that did my manicure/pedicure were pretty good, they painted my nails evenly, but it seems like I was being rushed halfway because they want to leave asap. I would come back at this place because they did well with my nails and I am happy with the results. My only suggestion is to come early so that, they won't rush it as much.
4	I truly got some awesome service at this salon. I've been going to the regal nails on boulder highway as my go-to spot near home, but because I was in the area we decided to come here. They were quick and fast. No hassle at all. Reasonable prices. And they did a great job on my gel white tip acrylics and pedicure. Felt like I was given a princess treatment! They were really talkative and all of the workers had a smile on their face. Enjoyable company. Asked me questions. We talked and laughed. Made time go by so much faster. It is in a Walmart so I bet it can get pretty busy at times.
