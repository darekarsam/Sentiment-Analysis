4	I had the chance to try their bubble tea and specialty drinks over the last couple weeks while they still had their buy one get one free offer (the flyers for which they were illegally handing out in various places).The first cups of mango diamond that I got when they first opened were fantastic. Many chunks of diced mangoes in a mixture that's has more taste than most smoothies I've had. Their prices are also very low compared to many bbt places in Waterloo/Ontario.The staff are friendly and kind. The restaurant is clean and newly decorated.However, subsequent cups of mango diamond weren't as good as the first and I wonder if I'll be going back again.
5	I LOVE this place. I'm a regular here for a reason and I've tried basically everything they have to offer... Which is a lot!The staff is what makes this place just that much better. Super friendly and just amazing people. Although there are many other Bubble Tea places in Waterloo this by far my favourite hands down. If you haven't been... I love their watermelon juice slush the most with green apple jelly and bubbles. Their mango diamond has a ton of mango in it which is perfect as well. Their pomegranate slush is delicious too. And of course they have classic drinks which are equally as great. I'm considering getting a job there. Oh and make sure you get a stamp card!
