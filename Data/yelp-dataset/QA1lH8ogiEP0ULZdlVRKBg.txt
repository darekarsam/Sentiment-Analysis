5	The staff here is great.  I got into a fender bender with a State Farm customer so I went to one of State Farm's preferred auto body shops.  I went in on a Monday afternoon to just get an estimate done and they were able to take my car that day with a promise it would be done by the end of the week.  I wish I had gotten a call a little earlier than half an hour before they closed on Friday (since they are closed through the weekend) but bright and early on Monday morning, I was able to pick up my car and it looked great.  I don't have a single complaint about the work done here or the staff
2	They replaced my bumper  from a fender bender and it did not properly match the rest of the car.  I did purchase the manufacturer's bumper and not the after market, cheaper bumper because I wanted the car to look as good as before.  Some sections where the new bumper met the car were smooth and others there was a gap and the bumper stuck out more than the rear panel.  I had them re do it and it looks acceptable now but I feel like it could have been done much better overall.  Also, upon closer inspection I noticed that the bumper was missing a screw that would keep it on the car.  This lack of attention to detail, which in my opinion is absolutely essential when repairing and restoring a car to it's original state, left a sour taste in my mouth and I would not recommend them.
2	The customer service is lacking.  Did not go above and beyond in anyway.  They did not call to touch base with us as they stated they would.  The finished product is acceptable except the headlights.  They replaced one (damaged during accident) but didn't call and ask us if we wanted to replace the other for an additional charge.  It would have been nice to have been offered the opportunity and it would have been an upsell for them.  They just do not take the time to communicate during the process.
