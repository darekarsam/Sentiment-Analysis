5	My experience with Big Mountain Genie has been nothing short of spectacular. If you ever encounter a garage door or garage door opener issue, call Big Mountain. They deserve your respect and your business. Call Sean Falconer at 702-374-4334. He is expecting your call....
5	We desperately needed a new garage door opener due to the fact that we are expecting our first child in a month and could afford to get the cars stuck in the garage because the doors wouldn't lift all the way. The previous residents of our home had installed a Genie door opener through this company over a decade ago so we gave them a call. I was absolutely blown away by the service we received by Sean. He gave us an honest and in depth assessment of what was going on with our system. In the end we had it replaced, which Sean also did, within just a few days of contacting him. The installation went so quickly and so throughly. He explained everything that he did to the system, everything about the system once he was finished and also gave our door an inspection. I will be telling everyone that needs garage door services about Sean and his company, and will absolutely be using his services again.
5	Shawn Falconer did an UHH-mazing job fixing my garage door. I had to run errands and so he left me clear instructions on what to do so he could get the job done without me having to be home waiting around. When I got home my garage door worked again and better then ever with a better system! Thank you so much for this pleasant experience!!! I highly recommend this company but especially Shawn for how clear and professional he was on the phone!
