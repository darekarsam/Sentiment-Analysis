5	wonderful experience ! Coffee is great. Would love to go back for the almond croissants ...! Also the cuban sandwich was nice and hot ! They have a good selection of sandwiches and pastries anytime of the day.
4	I stopped with Java U with my SO for a caffeniated beverage on our wait to dinner in Montreal.  The cafe was very modern and open.  It was nice to see a non-chain coffee place on Sherbrooke.  We were pleasantly surprised that they had a full menu of food along side their beverage list.We decided to get an italian soda vs. coffee and it was well made.  There was ample seating with comfy bench couches you could relax at.  This location looks like a McGill university hang-out as there were a few students with their laptops working away.I found out they have other Java U locations in the city, I will definitely keep an eye out for one in the future whenever I am in Montreal.
3	Good coffee.Horrible wifi.Not enough light to study but nice place to hang out with friends over coffee.
