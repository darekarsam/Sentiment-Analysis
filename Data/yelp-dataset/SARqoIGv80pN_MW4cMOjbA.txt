5	Now please, save your laughter. Bruntsfield Hoover Services - yes, it does seem a bit ridiculous, but I have lost count of the amount of times this shop has been my knight in shining armour. Think about it, how many times has your hoover broken? Or a lamp, your tv, anything! The best thing about this cute, small, family-run shop is that they will bend over backwards to help you. They are consistent with their opening hours and overall is a very pleasant experience! It's not often you can find somebody to help you with a small handy-man style job in a big city, and Bruntsfiend Hoover Service provides exactly that.

Don't get me wrong, it's still an excellent service and definitely worthwhile, but it is, as Sam C said, quite expensive. But to be honest I don't  mind paying a little bit extra for all the times I've needed a helping hand.
