5	This is a great dentist office! We had no wait time and were taken right away. The dental asst. was very patient with my son, so was the dentist. The dentist, Dr. Amy, explained things to my son very clearly and he understood even though he's 3. They have flat screens above the chairs and they are positioned so that you can watch while laying back. So cool! I would recommend this office to any parents who want an easy dentist visit.
5	My husband and I took our 3 year old boy here and I cannot say enough good things about them. Our son is very active and sitting down for over 15 minutes is not something he does but with them, he did. The Assistant Ashley was amazing! she kept him entertained and followed all his conversations like a pro! She got him to stand still, put the xray vest on him and got him to keep the mouth piece in to take xrays of his whole mouth! Then, while Dr Kath (who was also great) talked to us and explained how he is doing, Ashley put the fluoride on his teeth without him even noticing and took him out of the office into the reception area and played with him so we could talk to the doctor more comfortably. She was amazing! This was our second time here and I recommend him to any parent in the area.
1	OK so my problem is not with the dentist. No my issue is with the idiot nurses who have no clue how to work with children. The attitude and the negative vibes these two douches put off made my kids uncomfortable and made them cry. Then these two douches look at me like it's the children's fault. Avoid this place it may be new and flashy but terrible service
