2	I went the other day to get some of my jewelry appraised, they only offered me $8 a gram for 18k gold, (it's worth $31 a gram) !!! What a rip off!
4	I've gone here a few times now and the gentleman that helps me is always really nice and fair with pricing on the items I'm selling.  If he thinks that I can get a higher profit on some items elsewhere then he will tell me which items I should hold on to or sell on ebay. Overall, a pretty good place to deal with when selling gold, silver and coins.
5	Went in with some jewelry and two silver serving trays just to see what I could get for them. I wasn't really expecting to get anything. They welcomed me right away and looked over everything and told me what everything was made of and whether it was worth anything. I was right, most of my stuff was worthless but I got a few bucks for a necklace I'll never wear. They were respectful and helpful. If I ever come across anything else, I'll definitely go back here.
5	Spoke with Avery on the phone and then met with him at the location on Blue Diamond. I found Avery to be professional and honest as I had my loose diamond examined by several other buyers and he said the same thing as the other buyers did.He offered me a higher amount than the other buyers and was extremely honest and upfront.I would reccomend this business and Avery to any prospective diamond seller.
1	I have never sold coins before so based on thier name i Went here to see what they would offer me for a late 1800's $5 gold coin offered me less than the gold value. Nice looking place with fancy equipment but at the end of the day the price is the important thing.
