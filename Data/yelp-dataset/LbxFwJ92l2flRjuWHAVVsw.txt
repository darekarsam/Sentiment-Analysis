5	I came in here for an eye exam and to get my prescription. Not only were they able to squeeze in an appointment for me the same day, but it was also a super quick and painless process. The staff were super friendly and proffesional, and the doctor (not Dr. Park, but another one, although I unfortunately can't remember her name) was quick on checking my eyes and was also very helpful and caring. Definitely recommended for quick eye checkups. Now I have my prescription and I'll be able to get awesome new glasses. And I only paid $10 for the copay. Hooray!
1	I had an appointment but regardless I had to wait long-long time. They kind of ignored me for a while. The stuff was communicating with me with hand signals just like you would do with your dog. It was everything but friendly. Bad experience on my part.
5	Dr. Park is very detailed and we didnt feel rush at the exam. The assistant, Jenny is kind and thorough and explained alot and answered our questions. The place is small but they are clean and super helpful and fast service! I hate long wait I get anxieties but not at this office! My husband & I were seen asap..dont just walk in..make your appointment but they did accept walk ins like the old couple that came in after us
