4	Let me say that I was pleasantly surprised at the food served. It was awesome! The meal ordered included: 1/2. Dozen oysters, fish in a white sauce with mushrooms, and five shrimp tacos.The service was ok. The place was clean and they apperently have kareoke. The juke box took us by surprise for out of nowhere it started playing some banda music and a ciuple of spanish clasics. Price well as all seafood places... its a little higher than regular mexican food dishes, but overall acceptable. The highest dish at around $12.50.The 1/2 dozen oysters where fresh and served on a plate of Ice and slices of lime. Delicious. Taste of the sea. Oh,  how I missed the short lived taste and experience.The shrimp tacos, where ok. The shrimp was well cooked,  the only thing that I would say needed improvement was the tortilla. The taco fell apart at yoour hands.The fish in a white sauce with mushrooms could only be described as creamy goodness. Loved it! It was a delight! The sauce was a light chese, green chile, and mushroom white sauce. Not spicy, but savory. Highly recomd it. The rice was light and had a. Great flavor as well the refried beans, which were made from scratch.
