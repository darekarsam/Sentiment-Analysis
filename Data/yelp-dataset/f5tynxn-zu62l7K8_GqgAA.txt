5	I usually go to gnc, only because I thought that I would get a better deal there rather than anywhere else having my gnc discount card and whatnot.  But I was wrong.  These guys don't give prices over the phone but they were 15 dollars cheaper on the product I went in for  vs gnc, even with the gnc card.  If you want to save some green go see em.
4	Awesome place
2	They have average prices on suppliments. You are better off to order on bodybuilding.com for a better price. I noticed a lot of their stuff was more expensive than even gnc.
