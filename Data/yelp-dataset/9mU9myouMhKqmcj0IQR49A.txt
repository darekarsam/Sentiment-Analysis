4	I've used Mears for business travel, and getting around Vegas.  Always professional, on time and reasonably priced - great value.

5	We went to Las Vegas on Christmas Day and our driver was ready & waiting as soon as we got to the bottom of the escalator in Baggage Claim.  He helped all of us with our luggage and his Cadillac Escalade was ready & waiting in the very first spot in the limo waiting area.  My kids were absolutely impressed with such a great start to their vacation - THANK YOU!  Our driver was wonderful and gave us ideas on what we should do while we were in Vegas - very helpful!
