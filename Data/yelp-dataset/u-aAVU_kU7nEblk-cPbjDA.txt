5	Great family owned and operated business that really values the customer and ensuring great service.  Prices are excellent and the services offered are reliable.  Need great pest control at a great price, provided by customer oriented technicians?  Check them out, you won't be disappointed!
5	Our first appointment with Doc's was made at the last minute, and they were able to come out the next day (a Sunday) which is normally not a day they work.  Jeremy came out and took care of the weeds for a very reasonable cost, much cheaper than other weed control services.  After one treatment, all weeds were gone within 2 or 3 weeks.  Doc's also handles our pest control and is prompt and professional.  Would recommend.
5	I was having a ton of crickets and found two HUGE scorpions at my house.  I called Doc's and they came out the same day!!!!  By the same night, I was already seeing dead crickets.  Doc's Exterminating actually CARED about me and my family.  They were personable and curtious.  I will for sure recommend Doc's to all my friends and family.  GREAT PRICES....GREAT SERVICES!!!!!  AND...NO CONTRACT!!!Thanks Doc's!
1	A neighbor told me about the Groupon for Doc's, so I decided to give it a try. We had seen a couple of scorpions and a few black widows. The technician was very friendly and efficient, but the product did not take care of the problem even a little bit. I have been using the same company for 8 years and felt they were too expensive. I learned that you definitely get what you pay for! So, back to AZ Bug Free for me! A Groupon is not always a good deal...
