5	A most AMAZING find! Delicious homemade food an pastries! Lindsay and Debbie are fabulous and the atmosphere is crisp, clean and airy. Had a breakfast sandwich and yummy coffee; even picked up an oatmeal pie for my room mate!
5	What to drink: the iced toddy -- it's one of the best I've ever hadWhat to eat: the breakfast sandwich, it's completely customizable but I got a biscuit with bacon, Gruyere cheese, avocado and an over medium egg.The biscuit is what sets it a part from over breakfast sandwiches I've had, probably because they specialize in their pastries.I only stopped by for a bit on my way to work, but they have an awesome playlist and some nice seating (inside and outside). If you're looking for an escape from some of the overcrowded coffee shops like Giant Coffee or Lux, I would definitely try working out of Ollie Vaugh's.
5	Awesome little find in Central Phoenix!  Adorable interior and a very relaxed vibe, both with the employees and patrons.  Looked like they have a nice outdoor patio but I didn't check it out.  Ordered the biscuits and gravy and was slightly disappointed by how milky the gravy was but I am guessing they had to quickly make more gravy or extend the little bit of gravy they had left.  Other than being too milky it had really good flavor and the biscuits were friggin fantastic!  It was a good amount of food too!  Took a bite of my daughters croissant and it was delish!  Real croissant flaky numminess, not the crap you get from grocery stores.  Had lots of other yummy looking sandwiches and treats and I will definitely be back!
