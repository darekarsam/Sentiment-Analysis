4	Happened to be in the area at Hair Plus. I was so hungry in between running errands I thought it would be a good time to check it out. I just grabbed a steak burrito and it was very good. It reminded me of my Santa Barbara days. The steak was seasoned and not skimpy. The rice was also good, not too bland or salty. The burrito came with beans, steak, guac, sour cream and lettuce. The lettuce was unusual but it added a layer of freshness. I only gave four stars because I did not sample the chicken which seems to be the moniker of the establishment.
5	First time in here and it was an amazing experienced. The chicken is on point! Nice grilled and really tasty. The owner was also there to assist us, and also hook us up. Really good customer service. I had a to go and the owner assist us with free drinks while waiting. Like whhhhaaaattt!!!! I can also see all the chicken getting grilled and chop! I will recommend this place to everyone especially if you work out "need some gains" and trying to get some grilled chicken for less price not having to do it yourself on your busy day. The owner was the Man! If I can give this place more than 5 star, I would!!! Specially coming from a business owner myself!
