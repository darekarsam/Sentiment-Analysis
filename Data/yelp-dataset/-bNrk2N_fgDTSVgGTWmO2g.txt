4	I started at CCAC in 2006 as a part time student and graduated in 2011. I didn't have to take out a single loan while I was at CCAC. Everything was covered by grants. It was wise of me to go to CCAC and save myself thousands of dollars.  The campus is  well maintained and the professors are  hard working and approachable.  My biology professor always had kinds words of encouragement for me. One  negative would be the incredibly long wait time to meet with an adviser to registrar for classes.  There were times when the whole process took over an hour.  Besides that, I really can find no fault with this college.Going to CCAC was one of the best decisions I've ever made and I'm proud to be a CCAC alumni.
2	Make an appointment for registration....I went in thinking I could just register but there was something wrong with my account. Then 3 hours of my life passed, lunch was eaten, and then I got to talk to someone about the ONE class I needed to schedule. Is there a reason that I needed to talk to someone face to face and not over the phone? I will make an appointment the next time anything happens, that way at least I will know the time to come in and will be seen right away!!!
