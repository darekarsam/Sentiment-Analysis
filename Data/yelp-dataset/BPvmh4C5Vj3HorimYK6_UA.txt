2	I placed an order on February 12, 2014. Having not received my order after 2 weeks I contacted them asking why. It took two days for them to respond to my email and all they did was resend my order confirmation. I responded asking what was going on and was told "Lipodrene had to be relabeled to meet new FDA regulations and is now shipping". Still have yet to receive a tracking number (March 6) and have since requested a refund - no response from them since I asked for a refund. At one point during all of this I did try calling their "Customer Service" number only to realize that no one actually answers the phone but that it is just a voicemail service.UPDATE:  After many emails and threats they did eventually send my order. It arrived on March 8th, almost a month after the order was placed and no apologies were offered from the Live Lean Today.
