3	OK, your mailer ad has a picture of a Brick Oven.  Where is it?Called for pick up to try some brick oven pizza due to the ad...did not see a brick oven only regular pizza ovens.  Well, the pizza is thin crust and good and better then many of the local pizza shops but not brick oven.  Also, had some wings and they were average at best.
4	Seems to be a little pricy for a small place, yet they do have delicious pizzas, gyro, shish kabob, and buffalo fries. Never tried their sandwiches but would like to one day.
3	I mainly order the kebabs when I come here.  A little pricey but they are quite good.  If they had an option for more meat and less pita/rice I'd make this place my full time controlled carb eatery in Carnegie.
5	If you just go by looks not the best place. But this is my favorite pizza. Also, not your run of the mill buffalo wings. Very friendly service as well.
5	The Buffalo Chicken Pizza is amazing here.  Place doesn't look the best, but the food is great. Some of the best food is from places that look like a hole in the wall.
