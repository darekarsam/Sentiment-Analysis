1	Horrible horrible service
1	My daughter went for an oil change, 2004 Chevy Trailblazer, charged her $41.00 for a $15.00 job.  Then proceeded to tell her that the serpentine belt was so bad she shouldn't drive more than 10 miles on it.  They would gladly change it for her for $100.  I got a Dayco belt at Autozone and changed it in five minutes at a cost of $35.  They were looking at up to more than $65 for labor. (that calculates to $780 an hour for labor) and you know they get Jobber price on the belt so pay less than I did.
2	40 minutes for an oil change and then a hard up sell at the end.  At least they vacuumed my carpets.
5	Quick service, super friendly!  The waiting room is clean and fully stocked with coffee and current magazines. Highly recommend!
5	Amazing service! They took me as I desperately pulled in 3 minutes before closing. I was about to embark on a big road trip the next day and they made sure I was going to be 100% safe at a price my college student wallet could be happy with! They worked with me and explained everything in detail and showed me ways to take care of my car myself on the road! Soooo great! Will always come back to this location!
