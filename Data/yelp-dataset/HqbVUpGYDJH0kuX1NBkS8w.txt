5	Ok, Lush is freaking awesome. Jarrah has been coloring and cutting my hair for 6 years. She is incredible. I always look to change my look and she gets what I'm asking her to do and exceeds my expectations. I've had my hair at all lengths and every color I can dream up. I live this woman! ;-D
5	If you are ever facing a life-threatening hair emergency you NEED to go here! I went from bleached platinum blonde, to eggplant, to red, to black, back to blonde, back to black, and then wanted to be blonde again. My hair was BEYOND damaged and I had no idea what I was going to do. I looked awful! I went to see Jarrah at Lush and she not only got me back to blonde in record time, but she did it gently and helped me grow it back to fabulous with her expertise. I learned a lot about how to be a good hair customer from Jarrah and Lush, and I highly recommend this place for ANYTHING you need. She also does awesome extensions, highlights, color jobs and get this: This is the ONLY place I have EVER been to where I do not have to go home and style it myself afterwards. It looks EXACTLY how I want it to as soon as I walk out the door! Do yourself a favor and make an appointment! You will not regret it, I can attest to this.
5	Jarrah is amazing and a perfectionist. She worked on my daughters hair, my sons and mine. Haircut, color and eye brows waxed. Family pictures never looked better because of her excellence.
