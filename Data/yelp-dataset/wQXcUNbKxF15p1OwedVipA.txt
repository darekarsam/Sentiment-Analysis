3	I have mixed feelings about this Verizon location.  My last visit (where my check-in came from) was a decent one.  Just had to upgrade my mom's phone.  It helped the store wasn't busy so we were greeted at the door right away and then taken care of.  The people that work here seem nice... however there were a couple of times where the guy helping us started referencing some inside jokes with his co-workers regarding some people walking into the store... I didn't really know how to react.  Either way, he got the job done.There was another time where I came in here to order the Droid Incredible and the woman who helped me flat out lied to me and told me my phone would reach me in 3 days...... TRY 3.5 weeks (AND I had to go all the way to Carowinds [FedEX] pick up location just to pick it up since they needed someone at the residence to sign for the package.  LAME.  I totally activated the phone myself without having to go to the store and see that lady again.  Needless-to-say... I did not see her working there during my last visit.Whoops I just noticed that this location has moved to Matthews Corners.  I'll try to edit the business page to reflect the change in address (just down the road).
1	Is it possible to get a cell carrier that has good service and sales. I hate Verizon. They are scam artist. They are so sweet when you are buying and so difficult when there is an issue. The manager is such a pathetic example of customer service. Best Buy Dell and AOL Radio Shack Time Warner we have another company in the race to the bottom. The other options are just as bad. Where is MaBell?
