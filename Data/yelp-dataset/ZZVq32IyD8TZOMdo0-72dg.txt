3	Panda Express... It's a guilty pleasure. Once in a while I'll crave their orange chicken & chow mein. Doesn't matter what anyone says... It's not authentic and blah blah. I don't care. Sometimes I just want Pandas orange chicken & chow mein and Panda will always deliver.
1	Well..... Don't ask for pot stickers when they don't have any because they will be red about it when you ask. Oh and if your debit card doesn't run through because you use it too much and it's a little worn b prepared to have cash because they won't even try to type your number in.
1	It is 105 degrees outside so we figured we'd sit inside to enjoy an afternoon snack. Unfortunately, it must be 95 degrees inside!!! Haven't these people heard of air conditioning??? This is just being cheap!!!No wonder the employees are grumpy and don't know how to greet you or smile. As for the food - bland, chewy. Obviously been sitting for a while. Won't waste any more money coming here. They have a prime location yet restaurant is empty. Chik-Fil-A across the parking lot is full. Guess I made the wrong choice today but won't repeat this mistake again.Ps. One star is the lowest you can rate. Would be 0 if possible!
2	The service isn't great, the store is relatively clean but the food is terrible. The orange chicken is way too spicy and the fried rice tastes like cardboard. The water cups are way too small like for Pete's sake we live in Arizona.
2	It's Panda.  Got exactly what I expected. It isn't gourmet,  it isn't even cheap really.  Sometimes I ask myself why I stop here.
1	Gotta love open signs but doors locked. There were still cars in the drive thru. Pulled on the door assuming they were still open since it was 5 minutes to closing and got flipped off by the employee inside. NEVER GOING BACK.
