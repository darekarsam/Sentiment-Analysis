5	Friday night the DJ was rocking! We got in there around midnight and it was totally packed. Bartenders were moving fast to get drinks for all of the thirsty partygoers waiting in line. It was beyond packed. If you are looking for a packed nightclub on a Friday night with a bagging ass dj this is the place to be. I'd definitely go again!
3	a little too small and ghetto for my liking. We were given a table right by the door, so we never really got to see the back of the club. The traffic is ridiculous! bumped left and right. However, once the alcohol kicked in the club was bumping! The DJ was mixing it up with the house music, old school jams, some reggae and tons of hip hop. I definitely had a blast!We got a table with a bottle of bar vodka for $168, literally equivalent to drinking rubinoff. relatively cheap but I would suggest spending 30 bux more and upgrading to grey goose
3	It is a good place but too tight.I dont recommend it to ppl over 25 ..
2	if i was still 20 year old, i'd say this place is freaking awesome with a funny name but alas, i'm way past 20.i was here with my best friend some holiday ago and we simply didn't had a good time. alcohol was flowing and it ended up being one expensive bill but the crowd was way too young for our liking.there's better bar/club around and way better place to eat that makes this place not worth it even with the pretty barmaids/barman.if you want to tell tales to your friends that you went dancing at pinq taco (you know..), go ahead otherwise, don't bother
3	The place is nice and reasonably priced 200$ for a bottle of Bacardi premium.The crowd was fine, although we started at 10 with bunch of frenz and the place was deserted till like 1am. Not many good chicks were there, few teens that's it.. nothing outstanding..the dancing area is also not very big. The music was good and loud but I guess after ur drunk music anyways sounds loud. Overall I will say an average place.
