1	I will no longer spend my money at any of the circle K stores. The transients, bums, and kids on bikes are always surrounding so many of these stores and management does nothing about it. Bum, with loaded shopping cart of trash just laying on the sidewalk all day yesterday. This particular location has a transient that basically lives there. Now all of the local teens hang out on their bikes with him and his dog. Also, this location, the tall manager is outside smoking constantly and is not friendly or welcoming at all.  QT has our family business. Only give one star because it won't let me do zero stars
