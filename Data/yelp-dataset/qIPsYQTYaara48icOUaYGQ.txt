1	My daughter bought me 5 gerber daisies on Friday afternoon and by Saturday morning 2 were dead hanging down over the vase and 2 more dead Sunday morning the 5th one is on it's last leg and wont make it beyond Monday. You can get better flowers at any grocery store. I would never buy anything from this store again. I would rather drive 25 miles to another shop than give them anymore money.  This ain't the first time we've used them but it is definetly the last for sure
5	I love AJ  Flowers. It's in a little, 3 or 4-store strip mall, right off Ironwood Drive. The interior is quaint, and so tastfully decorated, it's very obvious that their staff has impeccable taste. I've become a regular.
5	Very accommodating and pleasant to work with. We needed flowers delivered with a hand signed card to Winchester & had trouble finding someone in midtown who would this Apache Junction Flowers totally helped us out.
