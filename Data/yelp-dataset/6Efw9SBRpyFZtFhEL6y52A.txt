1	Absolutely the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten. I just wasted 30$ of hard earned money. They also made a big mistake with my order. I ordered 2 of the combos that are supposed to come with wonton soup and rice. They delivered the principal plates instead which were more expensive and I did not get any rice or soup and when I called to let them know they refused to fix it. The Beef broccoli had a strange smell to it and the beef was grey. The poulet ananas looked like it was deep fried 2 days ago and then just reheated and it had a very small amount of sauce and burnt pinapple chunks.    Would not recommend.
3	No reason this place should get only bad reviews. It's not the most elegant of restaurants but it's clean, food is good and portions are very generous. In Quebec most people are used to Chinese buffet style food. Le Dragon Manifique is definitely not in this style. It's roots come from Peru South America (hence the largely Latino clientele) There is an extremely large and established Chinese community in Peru. The best Chinese food I have ever eaten was in Peru. So leave your preconceptions about what Chinese food in Quebec is usually like and give them a try.
