5	The combo with cold spicy noodles and galbi was spot on. It came with three sides that were equally delicious!
4	This is located inside Greenland supermarket. Went there to try their samgyetang or chicken ginseng soup. It took about 15 minutes for the food to come out. I felt it was a bit long since food court is supposed to be selling items that are quick to serve. The taste and freshness of the side dishes could be better. The chicken ginseng soup was decent. I felt I was getting healthier and stronger. It is one of the Korean dishes that boosts your stamina.
