1	This establishment is no longer in business. The phone number is someone's private number.
4	Newly open establishment with friendly service. The bartenders are great, second time there had a sample of beer ready for me before I even sat down. Very clean looking place and also a very diverse menu.
1	Service was a little weak,,,,,,Bartender was also the cook....NO ONE in the place at 12:30pm on a Friday should have clued me in......took forever to get my lunch. It was cold, the fry grease looked as if it hadn't been changed since the 90's. Pastrami sandwich tasted spoiled....would not recommend.
1	One star is being generous by 3 stars. My wife and I have been in here 4 times. The first time, we just had drinks so no big deal. Second time, we went to eat and after sitting at a table for 15 minutes with no acknowledgement, we left. Third time, had a good experience so we decided that the second time must have been a fluke. Nope. This was our fourth and last time there. Ordered a beer and iced tea and asked for sweetener, Had to go to the bar to ask for it again because she forgot. Then she completely forgot about us.  No menus, nothing. One went out to smoke then so did the others. Never did get a check so just left some cash on the high top and left. We will never be back. By the way- there were never more then 5-8 people in here on any of the times we went so the service had nothing to do with them being too busy.
