5	Amazing!!!  do not let the term chiropractor fool you, D.N.F.T. is NOT like the crack and pull chiropractor.  This non-force actually works!!  After years of pain I am finally pain free, and I can look all the way behind my left shoulder.  After 7 years of not being able to move my head left more then 15 degrees, I can look behind me!!  It's almost a strange sensation to feel good.  I highly recommend Harlan Sparer to anyone who wants to be pain free.  It's also great how he's open late and on Sundays!!
5	It has been 18 months since I saw Dr. Sparer and have  neglected going for a routine exam.  My knees began hurting  a few months ago and recently my shoulder began to hurt. When my shoulder hurt so badly that I couldn't drive I thought it was time to make an appointment! I saw Dr. Sparer on Sunday evening and Monday morning for treatment for my knees and shoulder. By Thursday I was pain free and didn't need an adjustment! I highly recommend him for his non force technique!
