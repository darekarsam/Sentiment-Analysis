5	Love all my visits to this store. Its small convenient and sushi's are just yummy. I came in early today to cut line up for WalMart and came down the food court to get some chow on. My go to places here are varied but somehow the sushi was calling me in. Anyway I got shrimp tempura 5 piece and avocado 6 piece all for 9.66 and they also gave me a nice yummy cup of hot tea to go with my meal. Couldn't have been more satisfied. The food is delicious and the people friendly. Worth coming here if you're nearby the mall
3	Pretty decent as far as fast food sushi goes.
