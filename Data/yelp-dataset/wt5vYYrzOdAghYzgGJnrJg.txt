4	Max's Alley is one of the few decent places in Concord. The atmosphere is pretty casual and the food is consistently good. The steak dishes have worked out the best for us and the artichoke dip is excellent. For more upscale casual restaurants - we haven't found a better place closer than Huntersville or Charlotte.
4	My sister and her husband turned me on to this place.  I have been several times for lunch and dinner.  The menu is solid and the prices are pretty good.  They have great dinner specials - pretty much every time I go I get one of the nightly specials.  A good wine list and a small but enjoyable dessert menu round the place out.  The atmosphere is relaxed and casual.  people are friendly and the service has been excellent everytime i have gone.
4	An oasis considering the lack of good places to eat in the area. Similar feel to Dresslers (same ownership) but more casual and with even more moderate prices.The food has ranged from pretty good to very good. The menu isn't large but there's a varied enough selection. There's nothing on the menu that screamed "order me!" to me but most everything was intriguing enough. I've had the trout in several ways, the salmon, the tuna and the steal and and all were prepared with good ingredients and skill. I'd lean to the fish more than the steak. The service is wonderful - professional, friendly, and with an attitude says they really care about pleasing their guests. Lovely atmosphere - very comfortable, with a nice patio with fireplace that lets you enjoy dining outside in less than perfect weather. The wine list isn't huge but has plenty nice choices.A very solid choice for business or casual regardless of the location, and considering its the only place to get a fine meal in the vicinity its a slam dunk.
