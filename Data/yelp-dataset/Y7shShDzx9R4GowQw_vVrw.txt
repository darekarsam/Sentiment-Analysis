1	ARGH!  Doesn't matter what time of day I stop here for either gas or pick up something quickly, it's a disaster.I always end up hearing about how some panhandler just had a birthday and needs some absurd amount of change in order to get back to the house they are staying at.  They are like flies there, once you get out of the car they cling to you.  I always tell them I don't have it, even though I catch myself jingling my change at them as they walk away as if I'm taunting them.Anyway, prices for gas here are the same as any other gas station in the area.  Selection of items at the window is limited to cigarettes and generic looking iPods.Stay away.
3	This Shell station is on the edge of an unfriendly part of town, so expect beggars and other rough-and-tumble types to approach you while you're fueling up.  The prices also tend to be a little higher than other gas stations in the area, but that means that, unlike the cheaper GetGo stations, you can always find an open pump.  Access to the station isn't terrible, either, as it has multiple entries on both Penn and Braddock.
