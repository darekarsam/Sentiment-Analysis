4	This is my local and I love their fish and chips.  The staff are really friendly and down to earth.  The food is always very fresh - I especially like the way they butterfly the fish.Just wish they did mushy peas - this would lift them to 5 stars!!!
4	This would be five stars if only they would move a few blocks closer to my house ....Very friendly service, crispy battered fish right from the fryer, generous portions, reasonable prices.  What else can I say?!?
5	My new chippy, and I'm a big fan. Freshly cooked fish, great chips ... and potato fritters! I haven't tried the fritters but you don't see them often in Edinburgh, so I'll have to go back soon for a fritter roll. The friendly, funny people who run it are Italian Scottish, and have Italian news channels on the TV, which makes me feel like I'm somewhere more exotic than Mayfield Road. A plus!
