3	Hacked...would give 3 out of 5 for a few minor things
1	When I was asking about the apartment the excuse was that the carpet was being remodeled so I was unable to check it out.  I didn't want this apartment by choice and my roommate did.  As soon as we move in there's SO many bugs!  The landowner blamed it on the neighbors from beforehand.  Alright, no big deal.  We ask for a spray which was useless.  I see bugs EVERYWHERE it's disgusting.  I don't even keep food in my place at this point and I still see them squirming all over the place when I arrive home.  Do yourself a favor and find a decent place that doesn't include bugs because I feel like I'm living in a dumpster and might as well have.   Let me also include that when I first moved in here there was a DEAD COCKROACH inside my microwave's timer.  DISGUSTING!!!!! We immediately had that removed.  I've never lived this way.  Because of this apartment, I constantly look through my drawers for bugs, my shoes, my kitchen, my purses, and ESPECIALLLLYY MY FOOD!! Disappointing, do yourself a favor and save yourself the stress!
