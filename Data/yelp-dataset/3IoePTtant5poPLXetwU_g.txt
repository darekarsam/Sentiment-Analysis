2	I wanted to try this Boucherie based on the fact that it was within walking distance from Marche Jean Talon. When I got there it was late in the day and the. Meat selection looked "dwindled down" and the shelves looked half bare.  I chose a bit of their Kefta beef and also what looked like a small tabbouleh salad. That evening I cooked the Kefta beef on the BBQ and noticed it lacked flavour. I had a small taste of the tabbouleh salad and it tasted a bit bland also. My wife had it for lunch on a few days and commented to me that it was really bad. The parsley was so coarse it itching her throat as it was so coarse going down. She thought it was bland also!I'm always up for new things but this experience was not how I had envisioned nor expected. Don't think I will be back as nothing can compare to Adonis!
