3	This place is very nice.  I've lived here for a couple of months and have enjoyed the convenient Uptown location, great views, and amenities such as concierge, pool and events.  Mostly the building is populated by a young professional crowd and is a great place if you are young, single, and work in Uptown.  There are, however, some downsides.  The biggest daily annoyance is the SLOW elevators.  You almost always have to wait for an excessive amount of time until one comes (especially on the 1st floor).  A second issue (or plus for some) is that there are tons of dogs in this building.  Half the people have a dog so it's kind of cute, but you may want to avoid if you aren't in to that.  Third, it is next to the stadium and also a large open parking lot where there are numerous fests.  It gets crazy when games are going on and there have been quite a few Saturdays of waking up to 8am speaker blaring outside as musicians set up for Irish fest or BBQ, Brew, and Blues.Sweet location if you are looking for action and love joining in on the party!
5	Best location in uptown...New building in Uptown Charlotte.  Great amenities with several floor plans. 24 hour concierge and a secured building.  Beautiful pool and great fitness area.
4	This building is very nice and has great amenities, including a nice sized gym, lounge area, and a very friendly front desk staff.  Also, I found the price to be quite reasonable after factoring in all of the amenities, additional charges you can find at other apts. in Uptown.Cons: Long wait for elevators, some noise issues (although all in all not a huge issue), and the parking is not always ideal for guests, etc.
