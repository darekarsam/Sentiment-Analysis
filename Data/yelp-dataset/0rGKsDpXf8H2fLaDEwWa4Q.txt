3	It's fine. expensive, but you get to create your own salad.
3	Good fresh salad. Service is not very enthusiastic but what can you expect at a food court
2	The guy making sandwiches, getting wraps, making salads was kicking butt.  Fantastic sense of purpose and urgency!I tried a chicken and provolone wrap.  While the flavor was ok, the thing was simply too small.  Like pitifully small. Maybe two slices of meat, and a single slice of cheese. The wrap might have been 5.5" long.There's just nothing redeeming about this wrap whatsoever.Take your same $7.00 over to My Big Fat Greek Gyro closeby in Market Square, and get a serious lunch.  I was trying to be healthy, but it's pretty hard if we're going to call this a meal.I was going to rank three stars, but definitely down voting due to poor value.
5	Best wrap I ever had! Bread and chicken is made fresh daily. The price matches the quality of the food. The guy who makes the wraps and sandwiches is quick and on point!
