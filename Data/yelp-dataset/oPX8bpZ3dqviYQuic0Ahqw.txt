5	Gordons in the Waterfront is exactly what I needed for new shoes after I was allowed to walk again after a fracture in my foot.  The man who waited on me was kind, patient, and even let me know about a sale going on.  The selection and quality of shoes is wonderful.  You won't get cheap shoes here but you will get the best. Worth every cent.
5	Extremely helpful staff that knows exactly what shoes are comfortable yet stylish. The shoes I bought were high quality and durable. I was extremely impressed by the staff.
