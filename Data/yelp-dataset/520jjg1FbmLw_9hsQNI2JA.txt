5	I've been going to Dr. Chen for over 10 years and can enthusiastically recommend her. She is capable and caring and is a consummate professional. Going to the dentist isn't usually anyone's idea of 'fun', but she makes it tolerable. That's about as good as it gets.....
5	Love Dr. Barbara Chen and staff.  We've been her patients for years and she's always taken great care of us.  Definitely recommend her as your dentist.
4	I recently moved to North Scottsdale because of work...I sent out an email to my co-workers and asked if anybody could recommend a dentist. 2 of my co-workers emailed me recommending Dr. Chen. I made an appointment to have x-rays and my teeth cleaned. I really liked everyone I came in contact with that day. I had to come back to get some old fillings replaced and was treated with respect and care. She did a great job! I am proud to say she has gained another lifetime customer.
