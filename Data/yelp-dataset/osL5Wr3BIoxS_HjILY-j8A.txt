2	I'm torn between a two star or 3 star. It's over priced for no reason ($18 for a chicken salad???), but the food is tasty. The staff was nice, but it was a friend of friend (so maybe that's why?). $8 for a beer??? I don't know. For the price I could go to a much better resto. It was half decent...
4	Love this place and the ribs are just the way I like them.The service is fast and friendly so that's nice. The booths are nice and comfortable so you don't feel all cramped out. The portions are very huge so make sure your hungry. You have to go on Sunday for the 2 for 22$ deal if not it is too expensive. Went on a regular night and had 2 steak, 2 beers and an entree and it was with the tip 86$ so its a bit much. Also the drinks like Martini 10$ that is a bit much if I can't
