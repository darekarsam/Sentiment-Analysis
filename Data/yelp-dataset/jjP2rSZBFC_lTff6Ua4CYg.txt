5	Very good dental office. Dr Nguyen is excellent. They are open on Saturday's which is very unusual and very good. Excellent staff also and nice office
5	Great place for all,affordable prices for cash patients, open Saturday can't beat that
5	Very highly recommended for the whole family. Great service and prices for people with no insurance, will be back as a regular patient
1	The only good thing about this place is that it's open Saturdays and a very nice dental assistant. Other than that I would not suggest this dental office. My husband and I went in for a dental exam/ cleaning/ X-rays - or so I thought, they just took exams and gave us a list of what was wrong with our teeth and the cost. The receptionist was not easy to talk to , and it was hard to understand her when I asked questions.
