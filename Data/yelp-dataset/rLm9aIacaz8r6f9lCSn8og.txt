5	A friend recommended this place and they seem to be very friendly and HONEST.  Took care of our cars last week and did a very good job.  Thank you.
5	Issac just went completely out of his way to assist my daughter and son-in-law when they were broken down across the street.  They needed a new battery (they didn't know it at the time, car wouldn't start after filling the tank), and Issac came over, diagnosed the problem and got them a new battery and on their way.Since they are new residents to Tempe, it is a relief to find an honest mechanic who is willing to go the extra mile to gain patrons.  Thank you Issac, we will be sure to return for future mechanical work on the Honda Civic (2007).
5	This place simply it's excellent,  specially the owner Issac he always try to help the clients at very low cost, I had very good experience with him, thank you Issac for being honest all the time.
