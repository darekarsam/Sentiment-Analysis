5	We've been using P&O for a few years on our fleet.  They have always been wonderful and their prices are amazing.  Thanks for the many years of excellent services guys!
5	Great Service at a great price! Had my front brakes worked on, super clean and fast! Follow up afterwards was great! Thank you!
5	Definitely the best service I have ever received from an automotive shop!I took my car into P & O brakes after having a horrible experience at Meienke. The service is I received here was amazing.I dropped my car off to be serviced and they went above and beyond. I was continuously updated on the status of my car, and the quote I initially received was what I paid when services were complete, no surprise charges . I had my brakes and rotors replaced here back in May and they still have not made a squeak and feel brand new. I will always bring my car to P&O Brakes, they are the best!
