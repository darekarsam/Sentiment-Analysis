4	Hey!! I am a huge coffee lover, and Tea Lover as well!! For those Starbucks never lets me down with its delicious Caramel Macchiato to its iced Green Tea Lemonade. It all starts with their top notch service, that for the most part is always consistent. This Starbucks location is one of my favorite ones, I must share! Since not only do I pick my refreshing GreenTea Lemonade on the go, but I also notice that this in-store location carries with it a lot of sales from time to time. I get to purchase most of my cups and tumblers from this location, plus great service from Susan, their barista!!Thanks for the refreshing hydration!! :)
1	The people that work at this location hate their lives and the people they serve coffee too. I have never had a good experience here.  Zero stars if I could!
4	Awesome service from the baristas, prefect drinks! 1 star off, on the occasion some guy works there and HE is the ONLY one there that like another reviewer mentioned, hates his job and anyone that's asks him to do it. I'll bump up the star if I don't see him around eventually, then the place would be perfect.
4	Excellent service, but not exactly friendly. Will, the barista and cashier for the morning, was calm and efficient with the line that formed behind me. Still, don't expect friendliness at this Starbucks. I gave this 4 stars because I still got what I came for, and it is really good. The actual service was good. I was gonna give it a 1, but I thought, "I didn't come here to make new friends. I came for coffee." I got exactly what I wanted... just not from a happy barista.
