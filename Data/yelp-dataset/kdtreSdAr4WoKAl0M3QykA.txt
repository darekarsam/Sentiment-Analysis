3	Not the greatest, but not the worst Chinese food. Not a big fan of the prices, but good portions.
5	I ordered curry beef! It was great! But the service was great! They cooked very fast and definitely going back there!
4	It's your average Chinese fare, but is very flavorful!  I change my selections whenever I order from here, but I have not been disappointed with any of them yet.  My fiance, however, did have a problem with the Kung Pao food because they make it with peanuts, which he is sensitive to.  Other Chinese food places we've ordered from don't use peanuts in their Kung Pao and there's no description of the items on the menu, so it's trial by error if you're sensitive to any foods.  Other than that, we still order from there, enjoy it, and just stay away from the Kung Pao.
4	My favorite Chinese place in AZ.  It took me five years but I found my cheap take out Chinese restaurant!  My son and I order from here regularly and it just seems to get better and better.  We like the green pepper beef and their crab puffs are good.  Their appetizer mix is good also.  Try the spring rolls with their real hot mustard which you have to request.  Very good!!
4	I have been going here for a couple of months now. Everyone is nice and you get quite a bit of food for the money. It is made quickly, and it is always hot and fresh. It has been my place to go for a meal if I have had a long day and do not want to make dinner.
4	They are not there anymore.
