5	I went to Concrete Accessories seeking advice on staining my own concrete floors. I was pretty clueless but had done my research and came with many questions. I was really impressed with how they took time to help me out and answer everything I asked. They look like they deal mainly with contractors so I appreciated the excellent service to someone like me, who is just doing my apartment.
5	Amazing experience! Jose went above and beyond any expectations I had prior to waking in. He was able to answer all questions and give advice on stuff I didn't even know I needed to know. He was able to provide samples at little or no cost to make sure I got what I needed. Highly recommended and will definitely be back!
5	I have been using concrete accessories for many years as a decorative concrete contractor. Their products are the only products that you will find being used on any artistic concrete work done on the strip. Their staff is beyond knowledgable and they will go beyond to walk you through any questions you might have. I recommend seeing David or Jose if you stop in and let them know Brad sent you!
