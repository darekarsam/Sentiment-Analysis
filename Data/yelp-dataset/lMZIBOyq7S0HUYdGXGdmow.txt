5	I arrived in Montreal after a 'red eye' flight from Los Angeles, a bit disheveled and pretty tired. Staying with friends, I was locked out of their home after a cab ride from the airport. Stuck, I was getting pretty hungry, and took my suitcase for a walk through the neighborhood to find some lunch ( or with my jet lag, breakfast ). Carmine's.....Thank you. I was a bit stressed, and who walks into a restaurant with a suitcase. They made me feel right at home. Kind and prompt service, and oh yeah....the food....I don't even remember what I ordered, just that I left feeling very satisfied and relaxed. If I get to go back to Montreal, this place is on my list. Thanks Carmine's.
3	my friends like to eat breakfast here, and come here quite often.  i had the crepes, and they were good.  everyone was pretty satisfied with their food, and the service was very friendly as well.  it's a nice neighborhood spot to grab some good eats.
2	This is an OK Italian restaurant in NDG. IIt's casual, and laid back with a fun atmosphere.There menu is extensive, but they seem to have a compact daily specials section which is nice. I stuck to the daily specials and ordered a shellfish pasta dish. It was quite tasty, but nothing remarkable. As as plus, the portions here are HUGE. You get great value for the price.
