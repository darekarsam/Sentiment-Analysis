5	The Rachel Carson Bridge is formally the 9th street bridge, named in honor of the Springdale native.  An ecologist, she penned the book Silent Spring, which proved the pesticide DDT was killing off wild life such as the Bald Eagle. The book led to the banning of that substance. This bridge is a self anchored suspension bridge that connects the downtown with the North Side. It crosses the Allegheny river.
