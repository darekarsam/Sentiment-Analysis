5	If you want great customer service and a very personalized experience, Mark is the one to call.   I booked a shuttle from the airport to my hotel when I stayed in Las Vegas for a convention last month.  Mark's online booking was very fast and easy.  I received an email confirmation right away and he personally called me the very next day!   Mark also met me at the airport and waited with me for my driver.   My driver was very professional and friendly.  If you are looking for great value and wonderful customer service, look no further.  In fact, I liked the service so much I asked Mark to help my group book a private shuttle van to take us from the strip to downtown.   He was quick to secure my group of 10 people a Mercedes Sprinter van.  He drove us along the strip to the Las Vegas sign, stopped and took pictures, then dropped us off downtown. I can't say enough good things about Mark and his company.  You won't be disappointed.
5	AWESOME.  I am a control freak (to say it conservatively).  Mark w/ Love My Las Vegas Shuttle handled all my questions and requests for our arrival into Las Vegas professionally and in a timely manner. Love My Las Vegas Shuttle is the BEST friendliest customer service, they were there waiting for our party to arrival in the baggage claim area....  They took us to the limo where they had a bottle of champagne waiting for us.  Mark and his crew were awesome!EXCELLENT experience and would highly recommend!  Thanks guys!!
