1	We went here as a school field trip. It was extremely fun. The only thing that disappointed me was that I found a lollipop on the ground and I tried to sell it to them for 30 cents but they said no. This is what made them lose 4 stars.
5	Great place to have a birthday party !! with wish upon a star children's party and Charlotte NC ;)
1	This gym has the worst customer service and a bunch of idiots working there.  I cancelled my membership 4 times as I did not have faith in the idiots working and was confirmed July would be my last payment.  Well last night August 2 guess what? they took another payment.  When I called the idiot at the desk said sorry there is nothing we can do.  So now because they are so stupid I have to close my checking account and open a new one and transfer all my drafts.  If you want yo get robbed and deal with shitty service join this low class gym.
