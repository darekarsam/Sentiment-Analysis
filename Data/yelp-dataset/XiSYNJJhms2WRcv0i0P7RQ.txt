5	I had an amazing CEGEP experience at Dawson in the Liberal Arts programme. It was tough at the time, but prepared me so well for university. You get to meet so many interesting people and the professors are dedicated and helpful. The school itself is in a great location and it's fun to hang out with your friends that you've known from all different times in your life at the atrium. It is attached to two malls and a metro station! Nice to have more freedom and responsibility than in high school.
1	I guess I'm showing my age now but I preferred the food 20 years ago when the cafeteria was under the library in the center of the building. The food in the atrium cafeteria is utter garbage. The pizza has been sitting under the light for 10 hrs. Everything is either super unhealthy or old fashion god forsaken finger sandwiches. You get fat just from breathing in the air! I've been reduced to packing a lunch for my Wednesday night photography class.
5	Great school. Staff seems to know what they are doing so less waiting periods and teachers are A class and most hold a phD.
