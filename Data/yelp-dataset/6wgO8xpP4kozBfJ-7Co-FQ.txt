4	OPEN TIL 1AM!!This is located on the first floor inside the Hilton Grand Vacations next to Circus Circus. I stopped in with my cousin so cause I was craving some junk food. There was a bunch of junk food, beer, wine and soda. I also saw a deli where they made sandwiches and salads. On the other side, there was a pizza kitchen. I spent $22 on beer and junk food and a yogurt for my cousin. We went up to the room and started watching a DVD. I think we got about 30 minutes into Thor and I phoned in a sandwich order. I got a roast beef sandwich w/pepperjack lettuce and tomatoes. The sandwich was $8.25 and came with a pickle spear and a small bag of chips. The roast beef was fresh and I was very satisfied.I still want to order a Margherita pizza, but I think I can only fit one slice in my stomach right now.
3	If you are in a pinch for some quick food while at the hotel this is not a bad choice.  I had a sandwich from the deli - the bread was fresh, meat tasty and cooked just right.  Unfortunately you pay hotel prices for a small portion.
4	The trick with The Marketplace is to remember that you are in Vegas, at a hotel and that not everything will be super fresh. The coffee is good, the bagels and bagel sandwiches are yummy. They also do drinks, some food and, adult beverages for your room.Yes, it's more expensive. You pay for the ease of having it right there. We've been happy with the service and our experience.
