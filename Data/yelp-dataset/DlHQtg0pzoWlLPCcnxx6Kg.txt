5	Super!
4	Went in as a walk in and was very happy with the out come. full set for 25 dollars was not a bad price at all. I was assisted my Wendy and she is awesome. Im very picky with how my nails are done and Wendy was able to deliver my every need. Good customer service. Will be a regular for sure!
5	I have been going to Relax Nails since they opened, I have to drive quite a ways but let me tell you that it is so worth it...!!  The girls are always so friendly and accomidiating, I never have to wait and when I leave, I can't wait to go back.  I highly recommend this salon to everyone.  I also took my daughters wedding party here before her wedding, they were so wonderful with all the girls and were certain that each and everyone of them had the best mani/pedi for our special day.  Thanks Relax Nails
