5	The on-site manager Elaine was extremely helpful and polite, that's the main reason why AA Bargain Mini-Storage earned my business. An added bonus to the great customer service, after shopping around for a couple of days I found that the prices here easily beat out all competing offers in the Phoenix area. I would definitely recommend them to anyone.
5	Not a single complaint, polite staff, good pricing and I got one month free. I'll use them again if I need to.
4	I came here with my brother to help him unload some packages. The gentleman running the office was very helpful, and very nice. He openly admitted this was not his regular location, and to bare with him fumbling about locations. Fifty percent off first months rent, which is nice. easy to access, and all in all honest about business practices. I was a little bummed for my brother they had no military discount, even though he had to sign an extra military disclaimer about selling his stuff if he gets killed in action. If my husband and I end up having any storage needs, this will be where we go. We previously had storage elsewhere, and it was significantly more expensive than this place.
