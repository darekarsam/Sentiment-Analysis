5	This is by far one of the best Indian restaurants in Montreal. Even though the guys in the kitchen are not Indian but Bangladeshi (like most Indian restos in Montreal), they still manage to hit all bases.Their Butter Chicken is to die for and probably the best in the city! Beef Vindaloo, their naan bread, Shrimp curry, all of it is really tasty.While this isn't cheap, Indian take-out, they have linen napkins here,  and you will find cheaper Indian places in Park Extension, this is a great place for serious Indian food and a proper sit-down dinner.
5	Traditional and home-made indian. Delivery wait time is long but worth it, although it is certainly pricey, it is hands down some of the best indian food in Montreal.
5	Ganges is a restaurant that myself family and friends return to very often. Food is great, people that work there are nice and having a delivery option is fantastic.  This place is a definite resto to try!
4	This food was ridiculously yummy. Some of the freshest and nicest tasting Indian I have ever had in my life. Not overstocked with herbs and spices and MSG. Just good flavors and ingredients.We ordered delivery last night too, about 8pm on a Monday, the food was here in 30min. I think if they're not busy, it's much faster than what others have stated. We actually planned on giving it 1.5hrs due to other reviews and were caught by surprise.We had samosas, pakora, chicken korma, lamb saag, rice and naan. Everything was amazing. Especially the chicken korma.It is on the pricier side though. But if you're looking for an alternative to Bombay Mahal type places, this is one of them.
5	Best Indian food for the price & quality in Montreal ! Everything was incredibly fresh and tasty! in other words, a fabulous experience. The staff is super nice and the atmosphere is really pleasant. I have nothing bad to say about this place, I ate there twice and both times everything was perfect.
