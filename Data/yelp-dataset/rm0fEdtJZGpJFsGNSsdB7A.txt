5	24/7 made my son's 21st birthday Vegas celebration a true VIP experience. Our Host Tasha is AMAZING!!  Definitely a memorable experience for our friends and family.  We definitely recommend and will definitely party with 24/7 again. Till our next adventure with 24/7.Extremely satisfied customers .
5	Holy cow, this was an amazing experience. Booked a club crawl for 11 ladies for a Bachelorette party on a Friday night and had an indescribably good time. The party bus was the highlight. 11 girls moderately drunk and singing top 40 at the top of their lungs while music videos play on the walls with colored lights all over...it was awesome. Molly took excellent care of us throughout the night!
