3	I haven't been here in several years and I noticed a coupon in my mail for a BOGO single cheeseburger.  The place really hasn't changed a lot in 18 years.  The dining room has been remodeled a couple of times.  The cheeseburgers were just as expected, I got a "natural" lemonade to wash them down and it tasted just like I used to make lemonade so they scored on that one.  This may have been the first time I ever ate there without getting a Frosty. :-)  The dining room was clean and every time a few tables cleared they had someone out cleaning.
1	If you're planning on using the drive-thru, be sure to check your order before you leave. It's almost a guarantee that they'll forget to put something in there. It's annoying. Screw up once out of maybe 10 or 20 times, you're human. Screw up my order five times in a row, you obviously don't give a rodent's derriere about your job. I would think neither does your manager about his. I eventually stopped going to this place and went to the remodeled one on 75th and Encanto. They're "open 24 hours" but may as well be closed. I went there for a burger and baked potato around 2 a.m. and first asked for the baked potato. "We stop serving those and chili after 10."  "Can I get a Baconator - Single?" "We stop serving meat after 1." "Then, WHAT DO YOU HAVE?" "We have chicken...um...." "Never mind, then."***Drives off in an late night, unending hunt for food***

Something about their frostees keep me coming back. I think it's because it's so thick and creamy. I absolutely love them! I came here for a quick lunch with my sister and mom. To my surprise we only spent about $9. We sure did get our money's worth though. I don't get why this place only has three stars. Y'all know this place hits the g spot.
