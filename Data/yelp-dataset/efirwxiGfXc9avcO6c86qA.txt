1	RUN AWAY FROM DOING BUSINESS HERE! I'll start by saying I never write reviews but felt the need to post my experience for other future consumers.  I brought in a set of high-end dress shirts and when picking them up two had STAINS THAT WERE NOT THERE BEFORE!!!  It took the owner a week to call me back and he said they would attempt to fix the stains.  I picked them up the next day and there were two more stains on each shirt!!!!  I asked the owner how he suggest we fix this situation.  HE SAID, "MY MACHINES DID NOT DO THIS!!"  He argued with me and refused to do anything for two $70 dress shirts of mine.  DO NOT ENGAGE WITH THIS DRY CLEANER.
4	Tried them for the first time yesterday. Overall a pretty 4 star experience.  Overview:Inside the store was clean and pleasant. I explained to the guy I was new and he added me to the system. His demeanor was not friendly, but he was not unfriendly either.  I asked him to explain the services they offered and their prices. He did this very well.Prices: $1.50 for laundering and pressing my dress shirts.$2.50 for dry cleaning.Payment:Previous dry cleaners I have used had me pay when I pick-up, so I was a little surprised when he rang everything up and gave me a total.  I handed him my debit card and he said normally their was a $.50 additional charge for debit cards but he would wave this fee since I was new.  I thought that was nice.Service:They were clean! As I was instructed I came back at 4pm the next day, and everything was ready.  Chances are I will use them again, because they are so close and their prices are reasonable.
5	Pleasant, courteous,  low prices and your clothes are ready the next day! What more could you ask for!
