1	Se horrible!  I can't believe how cold the fries are! My chicken sandwich had the smallest amount of chicken I've ever seen on a sandwich. The salad was served without sauce. Nichols served were cold with little cheese. I'd skip this one if I were you.
1	Went twice, hated it twice. Pizzas are too salted, food is very average. Ingredients are low quality. Won't go back.
5	Surprised at the bad reviews, I've never experienced bad food or bad service there. Some of my 1 star reviews however really describe what bad to me really is. I've always had great food and friendly service at Boston pizza. The only pizza I liked was the Mediterranean one, the rest I agree, take out is better. Try the pizza burger or pizza poutine or even the fried pizza spring rolls instead. Burgers are great so are the many sandwiches. Last thing I tried was breaded buffalo chicken sandwich with Cesar salad which I enjoyed, the bread tasted like local bakery bread and not store bought, big plus ! My friend had sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo, delicious !I've never ordered from there but the food and service at the restaurant was always great in my opinion and the ones of my friends/ family. I've been to BP about 5x already and I'm definitely going back.
3	Tried a few Boston pizza and the food is good but the experience is never the same from one place to another.The place was pretty busy and they ended up placing us on the bar side.A game hockey was on so it was pretty loud and the service was really slow.We started with a few drinks and they were very good.We all had the classic burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was very juicy and tasty and the portion was huge.We had two different waitress and even with 2 it took forever to get the bills.
