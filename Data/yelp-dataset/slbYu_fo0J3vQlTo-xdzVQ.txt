5	Tucked away in the Estrella Mountain area is a little gem of a spa studio inside David Gerard's Salon.AJ ( Andrea Jenkins) has created a sweet spot for those of us that want to stay young and enjoy doing it.  Her facials are clinical (she uses Image skincare) so you know you will get great results and best of all you are totally relaxed.I needed extractions, which can be unpleasant, but she is a pro. She offers a wide range of facials, chemical peels, eyelash extensions, spray tanning and waxing.If you are look for affordable luxury, AJ is the esthetician to see!
5	Wonderful find! I just saw her today and all I can say is I hit the jackpot! I just moved to az and as any woman knows trying to find someone to do a Brazilian wax is a pretty anxious experience but right when I met her I felt comfortable. She knows exactly what she is doing and from someone that has been waxing over 12 years I can say she is the best! I have very sensitive skin and have always left everywhere else with some soreness/sensitivity and today I left without any of that. She was quick and efficient. I also got a facial as I bought her yelp deal and she also did a fantastic job on that. No need for me to look any further I have found my regular estetician! Also want to add my navigation took me to a field so if yours takes you there turn around and it's in a strip mall on the left.
5	Skin therapy by aj is amazing! This was my first time going to her and im glad i did. She really took her time making sure that you are comfortable and relaxed. She also helped my with other issues hat i had. I highly recommened aj if you are lookimg for a great bikini waxer. Thank you aj i deffinately will be comming back.
5	I love this place! AJ is incredibly talented and professional. Best facials I've ever received!
