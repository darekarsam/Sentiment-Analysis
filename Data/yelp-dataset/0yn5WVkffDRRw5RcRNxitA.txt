3	Came here after I got tired of sneezing everyday due to environmental and seasonable allergens. I was on time for my appointment but they made me wait for 20 minutes! After sitting around in the lobby for 20 minutes I came up to their front desk and gave the host lady a hard time and while I was arguing with her about me being on time and they're being tardy to see me, they called my name. I think everyone needs to do this so doctor appointments aren't an hour late all the time. That is an unacceptable practice. Try that with any other kinds of business and see how far you'll get in the world. So I got to the patient room and waited another five minutes, a physician assistant showed up and immediately asked me about my situation. He was very helpful and attentive. He suggested I get an allergy injection, which I reluctantly agreed to after googling its history and side effects. Just in case you're wondering, the physician assistant was googling with me!Anyway, Dr. Pallacios came in and talked for like a minute before leaving the room. I hope they pay the physician assistant well since he did most of the work.Since my Kenalog injection I felt like whole again. No more running nose and sneezing everyday. It's great!!Just a side note - this doctor office has fancy lamps hanging from the ceiling. (Look up and enjoy!)
5	It takes something major for me to come see a doctor. In this case I lost hearing in my left ear. Dr Dennis Dey was quick to asses the problem and prescribed medications to resolve my issues. He is very knowledgable and kind. I am back a month later for a follow up visit and my hearing has returned. I am very grateful to have my hearing back and thankful to have met him!!
1	if you need hearing aids in any kind of reasonable time frame avoid like the plague. I am still trying to clean up the mess they made of my insurance.
