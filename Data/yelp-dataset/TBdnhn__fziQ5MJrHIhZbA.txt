5	Needed an electrician and my neighbor recommended Econolight.  My neighbor has very high standards so I had confidence in the recommendation.  She did not let me down.  Econolight showed when they said they would.  Gave me an estimate and then did the work.  They were very professional and honest and did the work for the price quoted.  Next time I needed an electrician, I called Econonlight.  Same experience.  They were very courteous, prompt, and performed the work for the price quoted.  These guys are awesome!  I would highly recommend them.
5	So Fast!! Jay from Econolight came by to repair and install GFCI outlets throughout the house. He was super friendly and did a great job! Best of all he worked so fast so we could get on with the rest of our busy day. Jay is awesome would definitely recommend!
5	I'm all charged up!I needed a big 50 amp plug for my new electric car. And oh by the way, my friendly review reading friends, get yo self one of these cars too if you want to ditch the smelly gas and wake up with a full charge every morning. But back to the review.. don't worry, I didn't forget about you! The price was nice and my guy made it easy to use the plug by moving past where our original quote was. Quick and easy, with good quality work.  Thanks Econolight!
