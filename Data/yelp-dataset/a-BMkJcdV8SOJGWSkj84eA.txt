1	This place continues to send out damaged parts so disappointing! I warn you to not except anything that is shipped before you inspect it. The will stick you ! There packaging Sucks and they will try to blame the trucking company it will take 90 days of you fallowing up with them and at the end you get burned. Good prices sucky parts and service!
1	Bad customer service.  Deliberately held up orders to charge more money.......bad news
1	Purchased a motor mount for my 2002 Volvo S80. Between 6 months and a year later the rubber bushing completely dissolved making this car unsafe to use. The company only offers a 6 month warranty which I can understand for normal wear and tear but this is a defective product that creates a safety issue and should be acknowledged and corrected.I can't imagine how many cars on the road right now driving with defective parts bought from them.
