3	Very clean service station! But nearly impossible to get propane, and the vacuums suck.
4	Really don't know why they are still listed as Superpumper on here since Shell purchased the station from Mobil many years ago.  Make sure you use your gas points from Fry's Food & Drug Store to get the discounts.
4	This is my favorite drive-through carwash. The touch free is so easy to take my SUV through when it's muddy on the inside and not the outside. The gas here is a bit expensive, but if you fill up when you're getting a car wash then you get a discount of $.15 per gallon. Not a bad deal!
