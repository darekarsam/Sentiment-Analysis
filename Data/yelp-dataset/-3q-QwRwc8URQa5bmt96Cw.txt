5	This is THE place for all your skin care needs! Kaylynn is super friendly, professional, knowledgeable and current on the latest trends. Love that the strip-less wax doesn't leave my brows red. Get a facial! Talk about relaxation!!

5	My regular 'wax girl' got married and ran off to California. Good for her! Phooey for me!As fate would have it, a deal comes up for The Skin Bar which is 10 minutes from my home. Sweeeet!!!My first time meeting Kaylynn I said to her: "I need to get to know you a little; after all, you'll be in my hoo ha!". She laughed and took the time to just chat with me about nothing in particular  before beginning to wax the aforementioned 'hoo ha'.Her place is clean, cute, and welcoming -a great reflection of her personality and style.  I enjoy our 'catching up chats' every time I have an appointment, and I like how she reassures me that  'I'm doing great" during the entire 'ordeal',Honestly, I have no idea if her prices are reasonable or not, although I suspect that they are. What I do know is that I love her service so much that I didn't even bother to look elsewhere.Takeaway: A pleasant professional providing top-rate service.
