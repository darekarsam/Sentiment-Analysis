4	Great, fast shellac manicure. Mayyela is super nice, along with other ladies. I had French tips done on toes & fingers and they are flawless. I LOVE shellac and highly recommend it.I also have heard that this process can take a long time, but it didn't at Arybella.  I had a color change on my toes (to get French) and shellac (also French) on my nails and I was done in under an hour.  This is a very laid back salon in a convenient location to Desert Ridge.  If you're looking for CND shellac specifically, this is a great find!
5	They do such a great job on pedis and manis! ! Also get eyebrows waxed! Awesome new massage chairs. Highly recommend... been going there for a few years now!
4	Clean, fast and friendly, even pet friendly I noticed :) I got a Full Pink and White set with a gel top coat, turned out really good. Cost only $35. They also have a large variety of colors and glitter tips. Also, a mini hair salon that does waxing :)
5	Very accommodating.  Kim is wonderful....great pets and nails. Been going for years, feels like family!!
5	Mayyela was awesome worked her @$$ off on my feet they feel and look great! Highly recommended. Great atmosphere. Salons name has changed to Exquisite keep that in mind when looking for them
