3	We took a cold walk out eastish on St Zotique to try Jockey. The snow was swirling and we cozied in on the couch, sweetly welcomed by a friendly bartender who kept everyone laughing and pretty well taken care of as the only server in the room. The smoked Ceasar he made and served me was tasty, and the giant piece of cured meat in it was over the top. The grilled cheese was simple and filling and good. The beers and drinks all seemed well priced and the liquor cabinet was well-stocked and made me want to come back and hang out. The decor is nice, but slightly off for me, mostly because I'd rather not have tvs in nice bars, and 3 seems over the top for a small cocktail bar. Why not just be amazing at cocktails and cured meat (ok, sure!) and not try to be all things to all people? The art was better than most local cafes and bars, and the lighting was cozy. In general, a nice feeling room, though I'd love a local place that felt even more comfortable, fewer hard chairs and cold open expanses, more like a country house, with big comfy chairs. Jockey gets really close to this feeling and is a nice option in the area. I'll be back I suspect!
