5	I have been taking my car here for years for my oil changes. They are super quick and no nonsense. Drive up, give them your info, sit inside for 15 minutes, and your car is done! It's pretty affordable too. Check their website before you go and you can bring in a coupon.
4	I dropped my wife off for a nearby appointment and was hunting around for something to do while I waited. With a long list of errands, my eye caught the "state inspections" sign here at Speedee and I popped in.20 minutes later, my wife's car now has had its inspection and I'm on my way.Quick, friendly, efficient, comfortable. The waiting area has a soda machine, a television and free wifi. What more do you need?
5	Great local place to get pretty much anything fixed. Just ask for Andy or Aaron and mention John sent you :) Always great service and quick on a oil change and most importantly they don't rip you off.
3	I was not local to the area but I figured I would get a quick oil change.  The oil change was not quick at all.  It took about an hour to get it done and the cost of the oil change was average.  It just bothered me with a name speedee and a setup for that name could take an hour to do an oil change.  Then the up sale which I would of had no problem going for if I hadn't just spent an hour on an oil change because I was not willing to be there any longer then that.
5	Always fast and has shown integrity by telling me I didn't need a service I thought I might need.  Nate is super honest and helpful.  Recommended.
