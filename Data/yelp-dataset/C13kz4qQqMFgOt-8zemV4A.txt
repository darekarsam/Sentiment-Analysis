4	I didn't actually get any work done with these guys, I was a walk in on a day they happened to be short handed, but I did schedule an appointment with them for later in the week based on their well kept garage,  clean uniforms, and friendly personable service, unfortunately I had to cancel due to the fact I needed my car worked on asap,  so I ended up going to the next garage over to proctors discount automotive who did a 5 star job fixing my car, but the fact that pro-tech was to busy to take my business that day is not there fault,  they run a well organized tight ship over there I can tell. I would recommend the guys next door first because they did an awesome job, but I also know you can't go wrong here.
5	Randy is the ONLY person I trust 100% to fix any issues my car is having and for basic maintenance. Pro tech is a little bit of a drive for me but I'd rather take it here where I know their prices are fair and they won't charge me for work I don't need.
5	Randy and Gabriel are honest and do good work with no BS or lies.  I have referred many people here who are also happy with their work.  More than a few times, I have taken my cars in with the expectation of an expensive repair, only to find out the repair is simple and much lower cost.  They could pump the bill with un-needed crap, but it seems they want the referrals and repeat business.  I would confidently refer them to anyone!
