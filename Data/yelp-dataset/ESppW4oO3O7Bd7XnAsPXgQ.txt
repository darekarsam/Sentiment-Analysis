5	Came here to get gas because it was the cheapest near me according to gasbuddy. The pumps has those long nozzles just like California. Gas was 3.79 compared to 3.89 else where and sams club was 3.79 so i came here. The place is really clean compare to the American mart that was here before. Fills did an awsome job with the remodeling. I normally hate Fills gas stations(read the complaint I wrote for the silverado ranch location)....... Overall I have to say the employees at this location is nicer than all the other Fills. I'll continue coming here if the gas stays cheap and when I'm in town.
5	This place has one of the cheapest gas prices in town unlike all the other fills today:fills #17110 S.

Down the street is a shell for 3.39, 7eleven for 3.55 and a chevron for 3.51. So I ended up filling my rental car for a really good deal. Also this fills has vapor recovery nozzles like they have in Cali.
1	Review for when this used to be American's mart gas station before fills took over.Do not purchase gas from this location, they are selling "bad" gas that is burning out spark plugs and causes corrosion in the engine.  Engine will need to be siphoned of all remaining gas and flush the engine to remove the remaining residue, as well as replace the spark plugs.    Phone number for this location goes straight to voice mail and not able to find a corporate office phone number for Luck Stop aka American's Mart.
5	SO CHEAP! Nearly .50 cent a gal difference! It only cost me $48.00 to fill my gas guzzling truck! Awesome!
4	How does one rate a gas station???  Well, I'ma go off strictly the gas price.  $2.24/gallon in December of 2014. I felt like I was in a time warp as I've never seen gas prices this low in years!  Circle K across the street (which is my usual go to for cheap gas) was surprisingly 10 cents more.  Filled my entire gas tank for about $30 bucks.  It was a Christmas miracle.
5	We are in town from ohio and I needed gas for the suburban I rented. When I got off to freeway at eastern. When I got to the light at pebble I meant to look at gas buddy to see where's the cheap gas station near me but then the light changed while I was trying to get to the app on my iPhone. Then I seen this fills at 2.12 I quickly got over and pulled into this place. I stopped at pump 8 and I checked gas buddy and the cheapest showed Sam's club and fills at 2.12. I said well I minus well fill up here because the strip will be higher. I paid with my debit card and to fill up it only cost me $54.64 compare to when I first picked up the car and I had to go to the Sinclair and the price was 2.69 and it cost me $89.21 to fill up.I know I usually skip fills due to the experiences I had with the one on Durango and also the one on Silverado Ranch. But as long as I don't get treated bad at this location and their prices are the same as SAMs club. I'll either come here or SAMs club. But if I see fills cheaper then SAMs when I'm in town, I will definitely will come here.Just a heads up to everyone, their pump nozzles has a vapor recovery device on them which looks like a long vacuum, the house might not fit older cars. But there's always the circle k across the street which is the same price if u pay with cash.
