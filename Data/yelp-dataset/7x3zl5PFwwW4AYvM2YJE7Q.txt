3	Small store, but stocked with everything you need to stay healthy. The staff are friendly and knowledgable. I love the Gold program that saves you 20% on anything you purchase during the first week of every month. My favorite purchase are the calcium chews...they are like candy and they're my "treat" every night before I go to bed. They are located in the Park Road Shopping Center...convenient stop.
1	It is so very very over priced.  I mean... even with coupons I spent $70 on a Multi V and some protein.  Come on now!  You have to know that there are online companies that offer prices at 50% less than that.  Also, the location is rather tough to get to.  It is slammed in the middle of a jam packed shopping center next to a Harris Teeter.  Not my favorite place.  -Ian M.
3	I recently ran out of protein powder and needed to restock. I used to shop at Max Muscle back in Colorado, but the closest one is in Raleigh so I headed into GNC to find a replacement. This store was small but well stocked. The employee was helpful but not overly pushy or salesy. He asked me what I was looking for and a few other clarifying questions and made a suggestion. I ended up buying what he suggested. What sold me was the satisfaction guarantee. It takes away the fear of getting stuck for 5 lbs of awful tasting protein powder. Their prices seemed competitive and you can get a 15% off coupon for signing up for their emails. If you shop here often consider signing up for the GNC Gold card for additional discounts. I still like the stuff from Max Muscle better but this location is dfinitely more convenient.
