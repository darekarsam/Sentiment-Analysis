1	$5 for a cup of the smallest size of chai tea latte that is a mixture of cold pre-made chai tea liquid and hot milk foam. Employees are not professional they don't even know the coffees on their menu.
2	I like Ancora in general, but really a dollar for whip cream and the cashier asks, "do you want whip cream?" like it's included. And then you don't say it costs 99 cents for a tablespoon of whip. How about changing that to, "would you like whip cream for an additional dollar?"
2	It's your only option for a latte at the Dane County Airport. It's inconsistent - but it is possible to get a decent latte. They are better with iced lattes as they tend to over foam hot lattes. Note: all lattes are made with 2-shots. So if you want a strong latte you will need to order extra shots for larger drinks. This can get a bit pricey. The smallest latte is $4.10.
5	Visited from Florida, I found Ancora in the airport.  I was extremely satisfied.  I ordered a double espresso, and it was excellent.  It was very intense, bold, and not too bitter.  I love how the Madison Airport has a local coffee shop.
