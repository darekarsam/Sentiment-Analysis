5	The smoothies here are exceptional. They are all natural with no artificial sugars added, with a unique blend of ingredients. If you are in town and looking for something quick and healthy, this is your spot! The best in Montreal!
1	I went here with a Groupon deal, expecting fruity delicious smoothies. When I arrived there were little kids milling around behind the counter while no employees were in sight. When finally greeted by an employee we ordered a raspberry blackberry chia seed and a strawberry banana smoothie. The fruit is not fresh, it's all frozen. Both smoothies were gross and tasted overwhelmingly of wheat germ and dirt not fruit. I don't know what everyone else got but our smoothies were not good. Definate miss
3	We stopped here while we were exploring Montreal. At the moment I am really into juicing so I did not pay much attention to the rest of the menu. The juice was good but there was a lot of foam, due to the type of juicer they use. Also, I did not see the employee who helped us wash his hands one single time. He took care of us and a couple of customers afterwards, dealing with the register/money and the fresh fruits as well ! Ew ew ew
