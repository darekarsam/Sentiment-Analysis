4	OK... This location is actually new. (A few months). The other location further UP S. BLVD closed to open THIS location. SAME ol faces and a few new ones.Its located on the RIGHT side (heading South) at the same light you wld use to turn for TARGET, AMC, ETC.Discount Tires shares the same parking lot, so if Traffic is backed up. Turn into the D.T. lot and drive around.Cheers
4	This ABC is located on the opposite side of South Blvd from the shopping plaza - at the entrance to the light rail station. Decent parking, but there is a lot of traffic so be aware of your surroundings.Staff is friendly and helpful, so if you can't find what you're looking for, ask! The store is well stocked and the prices are as low as are legally allowed. It's a monopoly - if you don't like it, well tough. ABC are the only people allowed to sell spirits.
1	Huge variety of liquor to choose from. The only thing I found to be disturbing was the fact that they wouldn't sell liquor to us because i'm from out of state. I have a valid Florida state I.D but I don't have a passport which is why they refused to serve us. My girlfriend is a North Carolina resident with a valid North Carolina state license and they still refused to serve us because I was in line with her.
