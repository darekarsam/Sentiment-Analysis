2	I've eaten here several times over the past few months, and have generally been impressed by the quality of the food and service. However, on my most recent trip, my experience left a bit to be desired. The teenager making my sandwich ignored my request to leave the onions off of my sandwich (or couldn't hear my response over the loud music, and didn't confirm), and when I took it back up to get it remade without onions, they simply picked the onions out and put it on a new sub roll (and of course missed some in the process). In my many years eating at Quiznos, I have come to expect better service than that, and I will not be returning to this one.
4	Excellent food.  Fast service.  Clean restaurant.  My primary complaint is that the thermostat was set to hold at 65 degrees.  Seriously?  It's freezing in here!  Bring your hand warmers.
