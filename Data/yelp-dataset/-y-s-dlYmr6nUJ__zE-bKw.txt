5	Had Silverado and 2 other contractors out to look at our master bathroom.Silverado was on time while both other contractors one re-scheduling and the other 30 min late. We decided to go with Silverado after receiving quotes from all three.We couldn't be any happier with the final product. Great experience from start to finish.We will be using them for our guest bathroom next year.
5	Highly professional and incredibly fast-working! Silverado Construction managed to ease the stress that I had while dealing with other contractors. Our bathroom turned out beautiful and my husband and I couldn't be happier. The most amazing part is that they completed the entire job in one day!
1	We started working with silverado and everything seemed to be moving along well. We made some final changes to our plan and the salesman John came out to take the final measurements. That was the last time he made contact with us. We called and texted him several times. Finally after 2 weeks we got a hold of him and his excuse was that he was so busy. I asked if he was too busy for our business. He said let me call the office to check the status - I will call you RIGHT BACK. It's been days and he never called back. Totally unprofessional and we are thankful their true colors showed before they started tearing apart our bathroom.  The last thing you want is a flakey contractor starting something and then getting too busy to finish it.  A courtesy call would have been nice but that's not how they treat potential customers I guess. BEWARE
