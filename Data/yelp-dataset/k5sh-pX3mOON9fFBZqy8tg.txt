5	Great atmosphere & quick grocery stop for basics.Yummy made-from-scratch European pastries & breakfast burritos. They have an older version espresso maker which makes the coffee much tastier. I'm addicted to the iced mochas.They are working out their operating kinks so give yourself at least 10 mins for pick-up. Upside is there's no line
5	Great and super speedy! Check out the french dip and the southwest wrap. They deliver pretty quickly too since its right there. Definitely ordering from here more often.
4	Good place when your at the pool in the complex and you need something. Pizza not bad for $6.00 for a large. The shrimp was good and the onion rings. The build your own sandwhich is good too for $4.00 they have daily specials.
5	The hit spot has been open for a while now & they still have hands down the best Starbucks coffee in town in my opinion. Since my initial review I have tried the onion rings which are actually fantastic - Freshly battered to order & fried to a delicate crispy. The Chicago dog is  delicious, piled with fresh onions, mustard, a juicy pickle & peppers & a satisfying dog cooked just right to where is has that hot-dog-stand snap to it. And then today I ordered their seasonal salad & it was also much more gourmet & satisfying than I would have expected. Hot spot I applaud you.
