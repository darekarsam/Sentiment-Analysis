5	Here in the desert, you can either turn your home into a Russian sweat lodge (that Halls commercial comes to mind..."Breathe, my friend, breathe!") or risk burning every electrical tower in a 15 mile vicinity in an effort to stave off 116 degree weather that just seems to linger when you're trying to sleep at night.One option is to put solar screens on the windows.  It's quite an expense, but it's kind of necessary in Arizona.  Plus it pays for itself in just two years.After three estimates, I decided to go with AESP.Reason 1:  The owner himself came to talk to meReason 2:  He explained everything in layman's terms and didn't try to up-sell anythingReason 3:  He promised to have the job done in two daysReason 4:  He gave me a great discount and threw in some items for free.If you're in the market for sunscreens, I'd suggest giving this company a call.  It's family run (mom answers phones, brother installs...)  The common terms are 80% or 90%, which means just how much you want to block.80% lets in more light than 90%, but also more heat.  90% blocks out more, but makes the house darker.  But in reality, I've adjusted to the point that I don't notice much difference until I go outside. AESP does not take ANY money until the job is completely done and to satisfaction.  That means the job won't get partially done, then left to sit for days making you wonder if they'll ever come back or if they just took your money and ran.So far, I've shaved 15% off of my electricity bill in just the two weeks I've had them up.  Doesn't sound like much, but do the math.  Even if I average around 20% per month, that's a lot of money in my pocket.  Including tax incentives (you get a tax break for any items that help energy efficiency)....More money to spend on food!  Who can complain?
5	Wow, I am so impressed with this company.  The owner, Kevin, is awesome and does the work himself.  They haven't had to advertise in over 2 years because all their business comes from referrals.  I can see why.  He came out to give me an estimate on Sunday, and by  Wednesday I had sunscreens and a new screen door installed.  He is very detail-oriented and takes the time to get the job done right.  I highly recommend this guy if you are needing any window screens, door screens, etc.  Check out his website as he does a lot more than just window screens (blinds/shutters, patio covers, etc).  Thanks so much Kevin!
5	Kevin and his team did a great job of getting our sunscreens up on our house with a tight deadline. They were professional and at the end stated if there is anything you find that needs attention, don't hesitate to call.
5	THESE GUYS ARE THE BEST!! *****VERY PROFESSIONAL***** CLEAN and PROMPT!!I had called 2 solar screen companies off of Craigslist before checking  Yelp. I saw that EXPRESS SOLAR had a 5 star rating. After reading the  rave reviews about the family owned business and the great work they did,  I decided to call them.From the moment Kevin answered the phone, he was polite, friendly and professional with no hard sell. He was not only fun to chat with but his price quote beat the other companies quotes that I had gotten! He took a lot of time to answer my many questions and scheduled my install right away! (Its takes a few days for the company to build the custom screens).I received a confirmation call the night before install, and Kevin & his brother showed up ON TIME the next day!  They also washed my windows for me before installing the screens!  THE SCREENS LOOK AMAZING!!  VERY HIGH QUALITY!!This company does many other services besides just solar screens and I am excited to consider them for future home improvement projects that I need done!*****AWESOME FAMILY COMPANY!!****HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!*****
5	This is a great company. I saw some reviews and decided to go with this company for sunshades. Kevin is very friendly and will get your needs covered no problem. They are very helpful from providing advice and to professional installation. They are however pretty busy most of the time and sometimea schedules might conflict, didnt matter that much to me since i was not in a rush. great rebate from rsp on the sunshnshades since they are srp certified. Im a very satisfied customer and i would highly recommend them.
5	We are so glad we found Express Solar Protection on yelp. After being frustrated by 3 other companies we turned to yelp and found this company. Within 5 minutes of making our phone call and speaking to Kevin we had an estimate and an appointment for the next evening. Both Kevin and Sean are very friendly, knowledgeable and professional. During our appointment they did an awesome job in listening to what we wanted then providing samples, demonstrations and upfront pricing for the products. We just placed our first of three orders and could not be any more happy with the whole process! If you need blinds/shutters, screens or film call them to see how they can help. Thanks guys!
5	I don't always provide reviews since I have a very high standard with customer service. Sean (installer and  share owner) totally deserved a good review. Customer service of this company was awesome! Sean was able to meet me at  home one day after I called. Provided a very reasonable written quote on the same day.The installation was smooth and all the furniture were back to where they supposed to be after the job was done. Sean even helped me adjusted all the loose shutters. I will definitely refer this company to my friends and family members. Keep up the good work, Express Solar.
5	Kevin is great. Very down to earth, doesn't try to up-sell you. Straight forward, honest, very easy & accommodating to work with. I will definitely recommend him to other's & be a repeat customer.
5	Express Solar, what can I say...They are the BEST! I work at a cancer support nonprofit in downtown phoenix on historical palm lane. We work out of a two story home built in 1908 and there are very specific things we can and can't do with the home as far as attachments to the exterior. However, we've had a cooling problem as of late and really needed some help cutting down the light/heat in the home. So someone suggested using solar screens.....Having never used or purchased solar screens in the past I was at a lost of where to start. I contacted a contractor we had used in the past and got some astronomical quote. But who knows, maybe that's what these things go for. Well, on a whim I searched yelp for companies and stumbled upon Express Solar. From the first call to the end, Kevin (owner) has been a fantastic help. He knew this was going to be a bit of a project and tackled it head on with no headache to me at all!  He quoted me prices for each portion of the house, we went through different colors of shades and frames making sure we were going to disrupt the aesthetics of the house. He gave me an upfront price that was very reasonable and we set out to do the 2nd floor only. (Remember we are a nonprofit... Gotta pinch those pennies!) Then something pretty amazing happen, Kevin showed up to do the install of the top floor screens himself and brought along with him screens for the bottom floor. He said with a big grin, "Not sure how these got here but lets go ahead and get your 1st floor shaded too!"ARE YOU KIDDING ME, IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT!!If you need solar shades, go with Express Solar and Kevin, this family run business is no frills, hands down the best solar shade company in the valley! From everyone at The Wellness Community and those that we support with cancer, Thank you Kevin!!!
5	Absolutely amazing company! Kevin was so attentive, got to work right away & had our sunscreens done & up within a week! Our sunscreens are great quality & look awesome! We also had Kevin do wood blinds in our house, they look perfect! We absolutely love everything this company has done for us. Such a great business owner! Would highly recommend this company to anyone who wants high quality & customer service for a great price. We will send anyone we know that is looking for window coverings to Express Solar! We got quotes from other companies & by far Kevin was the best price & ready for our business!  Thank you Kevin!
5	Kevin at Express Solar installed our sunscreens about 18 months ago.  They've made a noticeable different in our home's temperature and our cooling bills in the summer months.  Recently, two of our second-story screens were damaged in a heavy windstorm.  Kevin made the scheduling and replacement process very easy and the replacement screens were very reasonably priced.  All in all, we've had a great experience with Kevin and his company.
5	Express Solar is a great local business, Kevin is attentive, punctual and does a great job.  I had window shades done in my house and am very pleased with the pricing, timing, and quality results.   I will definitely suggest Express Solar in the future.   I recommend 100%.
5	I'd gotten a few quotes for bug screens for my windows and arcadia door, and I'm so glad that I went with Express Solar. Kevin was a pleasure to do business with, so much so that I hope to have him install some garage shelving in the near future! He was professional, on-time, used good communication, had attention to detail, and overall has amazing customer service. Two thumbs up!
5	Express Solar was great for us.  We had a small job (2 sun screens) and Kevin came out to give us a quote.  Kevin educated me on the best way to shade my house, still following my strict HOA guidelines. The price was great and we are very happy with them.  I would recommend Express Solar and will use them in the future for other jobs.
5	At the recommendation of an AC technician we decided to get sunscreens for our east and west windows.  Kevin came out right away for an estimate.  I like to be thorough so I told him I had a few other estimates scheduled before I would make a decision.  I should've just set up the installation right away as Kevin had everyone beat without having to price match.  He was also very thorough in explaining the differences in 80% vs 90%, quoting actual statistics in one vs the other.I called Kevin to proceed with his bid and he came out the next day to do our upstairs measurements (which he offered to do the first time, but I wanted to wait on the other estimates).  The screens were ready on the weekend and he offered to come out either Saturday or Monday.  We opted for Saturday and he came right out and wrapped up installation in no time.A week later and we're very happy with the sunscreens.  Definitely a major improvement.  I'm glad I came across Express Solar Protection on Yelp.  I'll probably end up having our South windows done next year.
5	Kevin installed sun screens on my kids' bedroom windows.  He was always very polite and punctual in our conversations.  His prices were very competitive and the quality of the sun screens appears to be top notch.
5	Awesome! Made sure job was done right & even helped me out with hardware an previous handyman lost. I Highly recommend Kevin. He is kind & personable.
5	Kevin was a pleasure to work with. He came over the same day we called, he gave a fair and competitive quote, showed us examples and had great knowledge regarding the best choice for our house. The windows and screen door are top quality and we can already tell a temperature difference from the window tint. Kevin was fast and efficient- if you want someone honest and hardworking call Kevin.
5	Kevin was awesome to work with. It's refreshing to do business with someone that is thorough and follows through on what they say their going to do. We are very happy with the product and the price was very competitive.
