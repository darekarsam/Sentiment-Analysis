1	I've played this course several times over the last three years or so and it has been going downhill for a while.I played this course on Saturday, August 6th.  For starters, the greens were terrible.  They looked like they hadn't been mowed all week.  The grass on the greens was about fairway length or a little longer.  They did not appear to be punched recently and there was no aerification alert on GolfNow either.  I teed off around 7:00 or so and it was threesomes and foursomes one right after the other.  So, the grounds keepers decide that is an appropriate time to water?  Seriously?  We hit into water sprinklers on holes 4-9.  Every hole!  I called the clubhouse from the 9th fairway and was basically told that they were on timers and there was nothing they could do.  So, they would rather turn them on during the busiest part of their week and make the customers suffer.  That's nice.  There has always been issues with their help anyway.  Discourtesy and lack of etiquette.  Mowing the back tees while you are trying to hit from the regular, refusing to get off the green while you are trying to hit your approach etc.So, today, I figured I would give them another shot.  Big mistake.  The fairways this time were what was horrible.  When was the last time they were mowed?  I am not exaggerating when I tell you the length of the fairways was somewhere between the length of normal rough and the second cut.  It was TERRIBLE.  Plus, they decided to water again while people were out there which really brought out all the bugs.It was the most uncomfortable round of golf I have ever played and I just got done playing 45 holes this weekend in 115 degree heat!  They have lost a customer.  I will never go back.
