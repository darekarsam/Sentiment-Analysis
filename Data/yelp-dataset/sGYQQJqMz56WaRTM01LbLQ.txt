5	Massage was great!  Wendy is very professional and really listens to what I want.  Decently priced too.
5	Wendy gives such a wonderful massage. She always asks for what pressure level you want and where to spend more attention, and she asks for feedback and follows cues throughout the massage. I feel so great after a massage, and highly recommend Mindful Massage. Reasonable rates, too.
5	We live in San Diego, but almost every time I am in Phoenix I get a massage from Wendy. She is great! My husband & I are truck drivers and the tension can really build up! She always pays attention to my stress points which is usually my shoulders and back.  I prefer a deep tissue massage and am never disappointed. I feel so good & relaxed when she is done.  There's been several times I could have just gone off to sleep for a cat nap.  I would recommend Wendy to everyone.Charlotte W
