5	Best facial I've ever had (I had the lumi lift with cherry enzyme and microderm). Victoria really takes her time with with each client, and she went to great lengths to explain everything she was doing and educate me on self care.  She makes you feel pampered and doesn't skimp on anything in her business, the decor is lovely and inviting, she offers you water in a champagne glass, cozy slippers, silky sheets, and a great hand and arm massage. She tailors her facials to your needs and takes a lot of time with you to find out what you want and need. You feel safe in her hands, especially when you see her wrinkle free, blemish free, glowing face and find out her true age... you wont believe it!!! She even gave me free samples of her recommended products to try at home.  The day of my treatment, I didn't notice much difference, but I woke up the next day with most of my acne  and blotchiness magically gone, and my skin looks so much better! I cant wait to see how it looks in a week.
5	I can't believe how lucky I am to have Victoria Nash to care for my skin. I had the Lumi-lift with Cherry Enzyme Peel and it looks incredible. I have had so many people approach me and ask me what I use and I am always happy to give her information.  She is amazing at what she does and so very personable. A fantastic spa experience.
