5	I have been to this store several times for myself and my daughter. Never had anything but a great experience. The docs are always friendly and take the time to explain things. The staff is always cheerful and friendly and make you feel welcome. The store is clean with state of the art equipment. Never had any problems with billing or insurance. The frame selection is great (I'm picky...)
1	Worst customer service ever.  I walked into this store to look at some new eyeglasses.  Not one of the 4 staff members acknowledged my existence.  I was in there for approximately 20  minutes.  No one said hello or asked if I needed help.  I will never buy anything from them or recommend them to anyone.  Terrible!
1	Horrible customer service. Spent about half an hour waiting for help while some guy stood in the back flirting, that is until his wife showed up to pick him up. Wouldn't go back to this location
