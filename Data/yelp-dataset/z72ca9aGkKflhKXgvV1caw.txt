4	Tons of affordable kitchen gadgets & untensils for the supercook or foodie. Found a lemon/lime squeezer here for almost HALF of what a chi chi boutique was asking, for the same thing! Definitely worth checking out.
4	A great place for anything kitchen. The owner is friendly and helpful and the price are reasonable. They carry everything from spice racks to pressure cookers to every mold shape you could ever desire. They also sell a selection of spices and Wilton cake making supplies on the side wall. I went in today looking for a spice rack solution for my kitchen: it had to not take up counter space and not be too heavy if wall-mounted. Sadly, I didn't find anything, but what I did find was a rubberwood counter hugging cutting board for $15. Perfect-o!
5	The owner was very helpful and their articles are really nice. He was able to point at what I was looking for just by description (as I didn't know the name of it) and I ended up finding other things that I needed and wasn't looking for at the moment. Great place to buy kitchen stuff!
