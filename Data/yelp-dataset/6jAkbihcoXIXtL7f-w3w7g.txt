4	For starters, this is where the restaurants shop, so you will need to either be a business owner, or have a tax id number to shop here.  Memberships are free, but you must meet the criteria.Now for the good stuff......this is where restaurants shop!Need I say more?  They provide fresh cuts of meat, fresh vegetables, canned goods, fresh daily bread, paper goods and a variety of items that you would possibly need if you are in the food business.The staff is friendly, and since it is a self service store, you get to load and unload your own stuff. This location is always busy, and is great for small food businesses who cannot get on with the larger food distributors. This is a cash and carry business, and they do accept credit cards.When you have that wonderful meal at the restaurant and wonder where they get the product, it may just be from here.This place is huge, so have a list, and take your time.NCFoodGuy

5	I really love this place! They have such a wide variety of stuff. Be careful you can spend a lot of money in here really fast even at the bulk prices.Tip: You will need to either be a business owner, or have a tax id number to shop here. Memberships are free, but you must meet the criteria. Dress warm, because it is pretty cool, and even colder in the refrigerated section they do provide coats for the fridge.
3	Three stars. Not bad not great. This place runs in a middle groove.
2	I use RD quite often, but it is enter at your own risk. There isn't any sign of management or organization. It is a free for all with other customers, and beware when you queue up to make purchase. Long lines, slow service and dysfunction with employees. The Chefs Store is more accommodating with better customer service, but not as convenient a location.
