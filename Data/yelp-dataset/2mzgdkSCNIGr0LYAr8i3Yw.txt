5	Good place to grubb for lunch
2	OK I hear people say Quiznos is better than Subway. Now that I think about it, jeez if Subway is the comparison  what the hell am i thinking. Anyway, Quiznos sucked. Food quality is betwwen Eek and uggh. Service was slooooooooow. Taste was bad...to really bad. Frst and last time.
2	Fire Doug! I have been here twice and the service is incredibly slow. You cannot get a hot sub because Doug takes f o r e v e r. I waited 20 minutes for two subs today. TWENTY MINUTES! The food is good (if you like cold subs) and the place is clean but I will not be returning.
2	Failed to fully impress. Why?  Simple. I Roll in just before 8. They close at 9. Only one person working counter. Ok. Not busy so let it slide. Other person was in the back closing up. I bought a drink. Wanted sugar/fake sugar free. Saw iced tea dispensers. Bought a drink as a result. Turns out Both offerings were also out of service due to "clean up". The manager should reconsider having their staff close down which results in reduced offerings an hr before closing. There is no excuse. I really think the manager is not aware that their employees are doing this as it is a way to be able to leave on time so they don't end up staying late and not being paid. If he/she doesn't know this then here is their wakeup call. Never seen this before in my life. My salad,  good size and tasty. No complaints. Wish I could have enjoyed it with iced tea other than some god awful low calorie fountain lemonade. I hate when all I get is a generic "sorry". No, you're not.
