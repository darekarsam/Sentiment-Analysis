1	I called a cab from Angrignon Taxi, mentioning to them that I had luggage & two cats to take to the airport & would need a van cab. Once the cab driver arrived, he knocked on my door and proceeded to descend the stairs, not asking if I needed help. I mentioned to him I would need assistance carrying my belongings down the stairs, and he turned and said, well that would be an extra charge. I said I was not told this by the cab company. He responded by saying well if you don't like it call another cab, which I did. 45 minutes later, the next cab came, however this ended up with us stuck in rush hour traffic, which in turn made me miss my flight. After calling the company, they mentioned to me that he was suspended for 24hrs, but there was nothing they could do about me missing my flight and having to pay another $700 to get a new ticket. Needless to say, I will never use this cab service again nor would I recommend it to anyone..Utterly terrible service.
1	I really do not have words to describe the awful customer service. AMEX notified me of a potential fraud alert. Turns out the taxi driver charged my card $1,200 for a six-block taxi ride. When I called to try to get the problem fixed, the customer agent informed me that this was my problem and their was not anything she could do. She informed me to call my credit card company. When I told her they informed me to call them, she said "well, I can't help you." Please do not support this business.
