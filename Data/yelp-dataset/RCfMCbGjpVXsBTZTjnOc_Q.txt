1	Antiquated and dirty. Snarky cashier. Inventory is 99% reduced nothing. Save your gas and go to your nearest Walmart or Target
5	I really do love this place especially during Christmas. It's always decorated to match the holiday and they always have great items. The staff is always friendly and very helpful. I always come here to buy Christmas ornaments.
1	As much as I hate to write this I just have to. I always loved coming here because of the vast inventory. I weathered the evil employees and management because there were just too many goodies.I mean, Millie is a bitch. OK so Millie is dead but Millie jr and so on are meanies. What is up with people who buy Hallmark stores. They all suck. Well, NO MORE!!! After spending thousands of dollars on Swarovski in the past 2 years, not to mention hundreds in dept. 56, I'm done. So, never mind that I waited at the Swarovski counter as everyone ignored me, I just figured it was the sweatshirt. I mean, I really didn't look the part of the buyer. I looked more the part of the shoplifter, but, oh well. Never judge a book by its cover. After asking for help I waited...waited...waited. Ok, so you can't find one of the pieces I'm looking for. NP. Not to mention after spending that kind of money I get the big $2 and $3 coupon from the big spenders Hallmark, I have to get attitude from the road torn and worn redhead at the counter? I explained how Swarovski is giving %15 off over $150. If you can't match it I will just order from them. response "OK" uhhhh  Can you match it "NO". Not sorry, not oooh wish I could, no tsk, the big FU NO. Goodbye mini Millie's.
