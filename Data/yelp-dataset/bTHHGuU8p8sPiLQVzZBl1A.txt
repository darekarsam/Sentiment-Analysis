4	One of my favorite places to shop.  They have high end clothes for good prices.  The selection could be better, but it is decent.  They also have home goods too.  This is usually the first place I go to shop for clothes.
4	Best place to buy a designer (polo ralph lauren Ck) suit/blazer for almost a quarter the price. The clothing selection can tend to cater to an 'older' crowd, but they have great price reductions on home decor and kitchen items. I will go here for my business attire and scented candles or what ever I feel like splurging on. Found a really cool set of coffee mugs that I have never seen anywhere else. I always pop in from time to time to see what new items they have- it is very similar to Ross and TJ Maxx, but with a better variety.
4	There comes a time in every man's life when he realizes he needs to do grown-up things like buying pillows and lampshades.  When you reach that point, Steinmart is your place.  Lots of random stuff to accommodate your domestic consumer needs.They sell clothes too, but I'm going to fight dressing like an adult for a while longer.
