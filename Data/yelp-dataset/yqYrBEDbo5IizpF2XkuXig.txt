5	The freshness & quality of the food is one of the best I've had. For example I have never ever seen any restaurant actually use fresh pepricorn fresh meaning still green and on the plant itself.  They have such exotic spices and veggies flown in weekly from Thiland. That is amazing. Can't wait to go back there again.
4	This restaurant is quite small but nice The personnel is kind The food is good but pay attention that you have big stuff. The chicken is not cut thin for exempleThe price is correct for the city
5	If I lived here, I would go to Spirit of Thai all the time.As it is, I had to talk my boyfriend out of eating every meal of our vacation at this restaurant, if only to be able to explore all of Edinburgh's offerings.The service was incredibly gracious, but it was the food that has me thinking of this place from thousands of miles away.You could tell the ingredients were as fresh as possible, and the flavors were complex and delicious. It was one of those occasions where I had to hide the remainder of my meal from myself to be able to resist the urge to keep eating once I was full. I didn't really have room left for the mango sticky rice, but we split it, and it was worth it.
