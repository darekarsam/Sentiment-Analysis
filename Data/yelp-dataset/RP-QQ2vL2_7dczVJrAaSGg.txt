5	We decided to use the Dog Wizard dog training on our dogs, Addie and Wilson, but we had our doubts.  The pulling on the leash, jumping on visitors, and lack of listening when called had gotten WAY out of hand.  We saw that the Dog Wizard methods were guaranteed, and this was important because it felt like we had tried and failed at EVERYTHING thus far in terms of correcting bad dog behaviors.  Well, I can assure all of you that we WERE NOT disappointed, and in fact fully regret not doing the training earlier on.  Our dogs live a different, much more fulfilled life now.  They are off leash 75% of the time, and we can rest easy because they actually listen now.  They walk right beside us on a long walk, no longer jump on visitors, and come when called.  It's amazing, and I know THEY appreciate it most of all!  They are now able to experience freedoms we never thought possible - running free on the beach, walks without a leash, leash-free hiking, and playing outside without the confines of a fenced enclosure.  The Dog Wizard trainers are also very responsive, friendly, and do their part in helping dogs in need around the area.  Couldn't ask for a more compassionate, dog-loving group.  Not to mention, if you ever need a refresher session, or have a question because of a new bad behavior pops up, they are right there to help.  Use the Dog Wizard to train your excited, unruly pup.  It will be the best decision you ever made, and your dog will thank you TEN FOLD!
1	Awful. I have a lot of training experience being involved in rescue.  The best trainers have a full arsonal of training techniques...not just shocking the dog into submission.  I guess with some dogs it works....but with others it doesn't.  And if it doesn't work they label the dog as bad.  Plus they are afraid to work will bullies and if you have more then a couple of dogs they call you a collector.  I would never reccommend.  Ever.
