1	4 months to go on a 2 year contract. T-Mobile has been and continues to be painfull.
1	I usually go to a 1014 E charleston location because they always provide good customer service. Today I went to this location because it's close to my house and I had to pay my phone bill. The guy that was helping me today (named Robert) had the worst customer service . I asked him a question and he answered me really rudely. Never again will I come to this location. I'd rather drive a little further and get better customer service. Ps this place doesn't even deserve a star. Sorry but not sorry
1	By far worst customer service I left T Mobil because of the customer service and prices.   I went in on plans of leaving Verizon but honestly I rather have polite customer service.   I went and and was never addressed more so pointed at. To sign in but then told well I guess I will help you.  I spoke with Luisita Iniguez she be far had the worst attitude.   I was under the impression that I would save money she keep telling me that price online was for pre paid.  In the end I asked her name and she said it I said can you spell that she looked at me like I was crazy and handed me her card.  Then when I went to leave she made the smart remark you can speak to my manager right there. Honestly I will not be coming back to T-MOBILE and I will begin contacting corporate to inform them of this stores practices.
