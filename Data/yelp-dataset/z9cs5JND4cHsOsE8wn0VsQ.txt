5	Comfy and tasty! Lovely place. Awesome location.
5	The Bristo Bar deserves 5 stars. It's cheap, the food is tasty, and the service is up to par with Canadian standards (that's a good thing!) One day it seemed as Assembly had magically turned into the Bristo Bar. I was intrigued. I've been a handful of times for mid-week lunch and a few times for after work beverages. Each time, my experience warrants five stars. I'm very impressed with the service. The servers I have had have been very knowledgeable, welcoming, kind, and overall in good spirits - essentially everything you wanted in a server. I normally go for the club sandwich, which with fries is four pounds. It's delicious. I've also had their halloumi sandwich, and it was great. It comes with a very generous portion of halloumi cheese. The drinks are cheap (it is across from Edinburgh Uni, after all). A pint of West lager is under 3 pounds. If you haven't had a West beer yet (Glaswegian brewery) definitely check it out. I'm a big fan of their wheat beer. The venue looks fairly similar to what Assembly looked like - but that's fine.I'll say the Bristo Bar has the best service I have encountered in Edinburgh. Do check them out!
