5	The last person review is for the DMV office accross the street... I always go to Arizona Auto License services (across the street from the DMV on N ELISEO C FELIX JR WAY). NO WAIT EVER. Prices are very good. (yes... you have to pay a little to not wait). 5 MINUTES and you are out.
3	Oh my god, I think I was here for a good two hours just to update the info in my drivers license. I had to go from one line to another and wait and wait and wait. And to add insult to injury they never even have me a new license, just a paper one and told me to wait a week or so for the real one to arrive.
1	Laveen location but same company, Third party MVD not State MVD: Very deceptive practice when the girl behind the counter stated my fees to register a vehicle that had not been de-registered were only $65. and kept my license and credit card while printing receipt for CC transaction and I sign and she still has my CC? Then she states my registration is additional? WTH? I said " you told me it was only $65 and that was it, why? She states "because it keeps you from not walking out and we get to do the transaction." Then she completes my registration. I specifically requested what the cost was and was lied to. Bad JUJU will come to you you liar. Part of the same people that do Title loans nuf said!
