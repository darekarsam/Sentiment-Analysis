3	Living in Tucson, this is the gas station I always stop at before returning home when I'm in the Phoenix area.  Usually, it's just to grab a snack, something to drink, and a little gas.  I like it's location as one of the last places to stop before leaving the Phoenix area if you are traveling Eastbound on I-10.   It is very close to the on and off ramp.  Bathrooms aren't that large or spectacular.
3	It's got cheap prices on smokes there bathrooms are meh hit or miss if its clean or not depends
3	Don't really know this place just stopped to fuel up and get some ice for the stuff we brought back from Hawaii for my sister, but it's a hit or miss stop .. Looks like a great place to stop if your thirsty and need some snacks
2	This place sucks. I only stopped here when I'm completely desperate for gas. And now thanks to their at pump super loud advertising, the dumb credit card machines won't even work. You have to go inside and wait in line. I should also mention this is the ghetto gas station. Somebody is always blaring some terrible music inflicting it upon everyone within earshot. This is completely normal for this place. Avoid it if you can
