5	I've been getting my lashes done for about 2.5 years now and up until about 3 months ago I was with another lash expert. However I developed an allergic reaction to the adhesive therfore she couldn't in good faith do my lashes anymore. Then I found Elizabeth whom offered to use a more sensitive adhesive on me and it did in fact improve my results however I still had a bit of a reaction. As a result Elizabeth took it upon herself to meet with her chemist whom developed an even more sensitive adhesive that Elizabeth did a patch test on me and to my great relief I had no adverse reaction! You can't get better customer service than that! I'm so grateful for such a caring and professional lash artist.
5	My sister in law found this salon through her nail lady . I needed a fill for my lashes and made an appointment . She was easy to get into and her prices where very reasonable . I paid 65 for a lash fill and I will be back! She was sweet and very quick. Her work is beautiful and she has made a new client out of me. I would recommend her to all.
