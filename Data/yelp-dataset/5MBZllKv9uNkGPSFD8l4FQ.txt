1	There is no customer service here , in fact the owner PAT cares more about his employees then customer service .they do not do what you asked them too , even if you pay extra they still won't do what you pay for . The Owner PAT cares more about his worthless employees then customer service . If you want the job done right take it some were else !!!!!!!!!!!!
1	Terrible quality work and ruined my repair work prior to painting. Left lights loose, ruined my lock. Rip off don't go here.
5	I was hesitant to use Maaco, but this particular location came highly recommended from another shop and I learned that each Maaco shop operates independently. BIG THANK YOU to Maaco.  Great pricing, great service, excellent repair work and my car was finished ahead of schedule.  The reason I was moved to write this review is that they tailored the repair to my needs.  I have an older vehicle... so it did not really economically pencil to pay over a $1000 to repair a moderate sized dent.  I had been getting some outrageous quotes.  Maaco charged half of what every body else was quoting.  I told them "it doesn't need to be perfect work, just worth fixing so I can get another year out of the vehicle".  The car came back PERFECT!  They were very diligent in their work.I'd be a repeat customer - but hopefully I won't be getting in more accidents!  Hope this post helps drive business because they deserve it.  The owner's name is Pat, but there was another individual who helped me.  I'll update this post with his first name when I find it.
