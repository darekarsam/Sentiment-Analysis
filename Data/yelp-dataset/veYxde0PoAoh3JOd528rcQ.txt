5	I find the price-quantity ratio EXCELLENT in this restaurant!! And for my taste, most of the food is 4/5 star tasty!! I personally recommend the beef and vegetable noodle plate (the small one almost is enough for 2 good eaters!!) And the big plate which is around 9$ is definitely enough for 2 big eaters making a good good meal come out to around 4.50$ each! The salt and pepper shrimps is also a must for fried shrimp amateurs out there and finally i thing their won ton soup is amongst the tastyest won ton soups i have had! I definitely recommend!

3	This is a mega restaurant.  There are different branches.  This review is about the one on Cote-des-neiges.  Unfortunately, service is brusque and impersonal. Our server, an old man, would not recommend any dishes. "Different people like different things."  Really ... no signature dishes?Food is not bad, certainly above average. And there are many choices.  We especially enjoyed the Peking Duck (heavenly crispy duck skin wrapped in rice flour crepe with hoisin sauce and some garnishing). However, unlike many Chinese restaurants which cook up the duck meat in a separate dish, Kum Shing does not do so.  Rather, the duck meat is served as is, piled next to the crispy skin, but is tasty nevertheless.If one comes here, he/she should pretty much have an idea what to order. The food will not disappoint. Just don't expect much service. Thus overall I've given 3 stars.
