1	I sent Azura five CD's to remove the scratches. Of the five, three were returned with scratches (skipped music) and one of the three had a song deleted. I sent two emails with no replies. Beware!Karen from LI, NY
5	I was very impressed with the results I received from Azuradisc. I inherited a pretty badly-scratched Wii disc that, despite my attempts to clean it via some of the usual DIY techniques, didn't bear any fruit. Getting it buffed at a local video game shop also didn't fix the issue either since the scratches were too deep and superficial cleaning was not sufficient. What ultimately needed to happen was that the disc needed to be resurfaced- meaning a layer had to be taken off the top. This is where Azuradisc hit the nail on the head. I sent the disc over to them and within a week (amazing turnaround time since I'm on the other side of the country from them) they got it back to me, scratches gone and the disc looking flawlessly shiny. The game save info was intact and the disc played correctly without any errors. I got exactly what I paid for and the $5.63 was more than worth it. This company delivers and does the job you pay them to do. Highly recommended.
