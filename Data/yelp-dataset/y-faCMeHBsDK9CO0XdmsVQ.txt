1	Worst staff and rude people at the front desk. They did not care about patient care or service. Never got a chance to see the actual doctors there but we were done after dealing with the ladies up front to make a simple appointment. Went to see another cardiologist at Cedars Heart Center.
1	I was diagnosed in the ICU by Dr. Lababidi with congestive heart failure. After release I went to his office to ask why my knee incision was "spurting" water and why they were so swollen. He said it's because I'm fat. Then my incision ripped open. Then he thinks, water gain aka edema ? I get the meds and lose 27 lbs in two days. However, he neglected to give me potassium and the surgeon said I would not suvive the reclose of the incision at my levels. Been doing this long Zaki ? Beware, a degree doesn't mean you're good at it.
1	As a new patient intending to be, I called this morning. I was put on hold for the longest time. I guess early call interfers with front desk coffee break. !!!
