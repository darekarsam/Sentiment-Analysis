2	My experience at this location was okay. I went in to locate a few items for my work. There were a lot of employees and they seemed to be talking more to each other than paying attention to the customers in the store. When it came time to checkout, there was a person that came up and finished my transaction at the register and she didn't put everything in my bag. Unfortunately I didn't figure this out until I was back at work. I was not happy that I had to go back, as this wasn't exactly close to my work. I think I will try a different office store next time.
4	I've only used their printing and scanning services.The staff is employed by mostly teenagers, they're a little funny a little rude but I chalk that up to being a pissy teenager in a boring city for those less than 21.scanning and printing is really cheap and affordable, don't for get your usp zip for the scanning!
5	I had some pictures copied from my Zip drive. The 2 ladies in the afternoon were VERY helpful and patient.
1	Horrible service! I waited 15 min before I heard from a customer the printer was down. I advised the staff I would return. She said it would be fixed in 20 min. When I returned 3 hours later she  told me that she did not know how to change print options sizing etc. and I would need to wait for her coworker to return from lunch. I waited. He said it would be another 30 min wait!! Finally I told him I would return the following day. Ridiculous! The service was so bad I thought there were hidden cameras!
