5	Went over & beyond to fix a Bad Delivery. Replaced the arrangement in less than 24 hours! Honorable business! Thank You!
5	I received flowers on 1/21/14.  Can I just say that these are the most beautiful, fragrant flowers I have ever received?!  And, the next best part is that as of this morning, the roses have just now given out, but the pink lilies are still so beautiful.  Again, the most amazingly beautiful bouquet I've ever been given.
1	Received Valentines flowers from my husband... Sweethearts bouquet ordered thru FTD...hubby paid for the "Better" selection at $54.99 + tax & delivery & I got the worst!  This bouquet is supposed to have 10 roses and have burgundy mini carnations not pink.  I can handle the pink carnations it came with, but 3 roses really!?  Their "Good" selection says it comes with 7 stems of roses.  Even if there was a shortage of roses due to the holiday they should have called him to see if he wanted to replace them with something else.   Apparently they can't deliver a new bouquet today so they took $20 off...what the hell?  That's still a rip off!  These should be completely free!  Good job at ruining a sweet gesture, thieves.
