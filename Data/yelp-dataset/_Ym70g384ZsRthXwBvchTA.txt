5	Working with Prime Auto Glass was painless and easy!  From start to finish, great service, on time and well done.  They even did the insurance work.  What a pleasure.
5	Prime Auto Glass was professional and courteous!  My company uses the Ford transits and while most auto glass places didn't have the item since the transits were fairly new; Prime Auto Glass was still able to get it for us!  The installer was on time and worked relatively quick and within a couple of hours we had new windshield.  So far it's holding up very well and after a year my windshield is doing dandy. Let's just hope the freeway gods won't chuck another pebble at it anytime soon!  Overall, great service, fast and on time.  We all hate to deal with our car maintenance, but companies like Prime Auto Glass just makes things smoother and easier on all of us! - Enjoy!
5	I was referred here by Honest-1 Auto Care in Paradise Valley.  They had the best price of the three places I checked, and their work was professional, prompt, and courteous.  The glass looks amazing.
5	Easy scheduling and they dealt with the insurance.  Tech was on time, very professional and did a great job.  No complaints, so I would definitely recommend Prime Auto Glass.
