3	I had my teeth cleaned here, and the service was great.I had my appointment early in the morning (8:30am), so didn't have to wait at all. After getting my x-rays done (it was my first time there) I had my teeth cleaned by Maria, who was courteous, fast, and very good. Afterwards, I had a session with one of the dentists there (I don't recall his name), who was very friendly. It took about 90mins all up, but the results were great.
