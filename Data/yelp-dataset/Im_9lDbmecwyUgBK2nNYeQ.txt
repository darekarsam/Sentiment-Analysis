4	Of all the places in the world to order french fries... Del Taco?  Yes!  Do it.  Crinkle cut fries, perfectly salted, and served in a large drink cup.  It's so ingenious!  I have come to Del Taco just for fries on an occasion or two.  In fact, the only other thing I've tried is the $0.39 taco which is also very good, but I like the fries so much that I order the large and that's my whole meal.
3	They have a nice play area for the kids and the tacos are ok.  Could always use some more meat and cheese.  Kids usually have a good time during lunch.
