4	This Lynx station is elevated with stairs and a lift. Not much cover from weather, you wouldn't want to wait long if it is rainy or windy.Surprisingly easy to understand audible announcement of next northbound and southbound trains. I did not see a message board for hearing impaired folks.Large parking lots are accessible from Old Pineville and from South Boulevards. Not much nearby. Taco Bell 200 yards and shopping plaza with Ross and Petsmart. They seem well lit at night, but they are quite desolate with very few people nearby.
4	There are two ticket kiosks near each elevator.You can park off of South Blvd and walk across the tracks to the platform or there is parking off of Old Pineville Rd.Clean and spacious. Hopefully you come on a beautiful day; there is very little covered space to provide shade or protect you from the elements.
4	Well I did it! I finally popped my Lynx cherry and believe it or not it actually wasn't that bad! I'm not sure what I really expected, but I was impressed with this station. There was plenty of parking and the ticket kiosk was easy enough to understand even for a newbie like me!  If you're looking to avoid the crazy traffic on 77 to get uptown...I suggest hoping on the Lynx at this station!
