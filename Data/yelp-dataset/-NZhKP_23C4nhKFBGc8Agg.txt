3	This year's version of the market has some pretty solid pros and cons over last year.Pros:The "streets" are wider so it doesn't feel as crammed with people.  There aren't as many repeats of vendors in one location (though I did notice repeats through the different markets).There is a somewhat indoor place to get a drink. Cons:A LOT of the stuff on sale is awful.  It's terrible tack with only a slight emphasis on traditional European Christmas items.  It feels less ...I don't know... Christmassey?  Or something?It's definitely all about the drinking this year, but some of the old favourites have gone (I looked forward to my mulled mead every year!) and they've been replaced by corporate vendors selling Drambuie or something of the sort, and they're mulling everything they can get their hands on.I absolutely still enjoy the market, armed with mulled wine and a German sausage roll, before heading over for anything covered in melted Nutella, but I was unable to buy most of my standard edible gifts this year and was very put off by the corporate branding everywhere.
3	Expected a bit more as everyone in SCO is telling me about the Xmas market in Edinburgh. They sold mulled wine, so thats definitely a plus ;) but a lot of stands just sold (not even) cheap non-christmas related stuff. Enjoyed the food and the friendly staff at all the different booths but at the end there wasnt so much christmas atmosphere as i hoped it were.
3	This year all the markets were labeled "Edinburgh's Christmas" but some of the old faves were still at the old school end. Not as many pretty handcrafted things, but lots of options for nibbles and plenty of entertainment.
