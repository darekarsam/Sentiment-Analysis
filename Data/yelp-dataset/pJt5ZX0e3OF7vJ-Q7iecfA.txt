3	Standalone gas station with convenience store, located right at exit 5 of I-77. Easy enough to get into or out of, they share the intersection with a McDonald's. Very wide pump area. My GasBuddy app generally reports that they are one of the cheaper places in the area.Covered pumps and you can get into the convenience store without getting wet. Good selection of sodas and snacks. I really recommend their coffee. Good stuff.
4	Quick to get to the gas station, conveniently located where its easy for me to pull and and out to be on my way to work. Service inside, at times slow... But I am only here for the petrol itself.
3	+1 on what the other reviewers stated.  This is located conveniently right off of 77, though can be somewhat difficult to cross traffic if coming from 77N  - you'll need to merge into traffic then cross over the lanes to get into the turn lane at the light VERY quickly, which is hard to do at peak traffic times since people are RUDE and won't let you over.Gas prices tend to be cheaper at this Kangaroo.  The pumps are relatively new and FAST.  Convenience store is stocked with your typical convenience items, good for a cold drink, a 40 or a snack.  At the light to get back onto Tyvola, you will be competing with the McDonald's traffic that is located right next to it, so be prepared.
3	Not the best place but pretty good location. They have many items to choose from. They also have a beer cooler+++++.  Unfortunately there are often people begging at the door and management does little about it to stop the harassment of patrons.
