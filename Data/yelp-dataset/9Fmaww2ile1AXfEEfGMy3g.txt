1	Dr. Lorena P. was hard to understand, impolite, and had a terrible bedside manner. She never once said "Please or Thank you." nor smiled. Pay first to find out they couldn't do anything. Not even a referral or a recommendation. Was told over the phone by staff to come by. Staff needs some education on what their policies are so patients don't make wasted trips that could compromise their health through lost time.
3	You get to see the doctor with in moments of walking in. The staff are kind nice and very professional. I will return because they help me and I leave feeling better :) The lobby is not clean tho you have to wait in a area that is quite nasty and it smells funny.
1	Went once with severely limited breathing.  It was close to closing time and before the (large, rude, male) nurse did anything for me he informed me of the fact that they were about to close.  He asked "oh, so you JUST NOW got sick? You couldn't have come earlier?"  In fact I was so ill that I didn't realize how sick I was and only after my husband came home from work he saw me and took me in right that minute.  Finally a Dr. came in and gave me a breathing treatment and a prescription for inhaler.  All of this transpired BEFORE the scheduled closing time, so the rude nurse didn't have to stay late.
