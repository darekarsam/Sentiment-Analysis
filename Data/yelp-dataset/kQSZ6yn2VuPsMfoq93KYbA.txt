5	This was a perfect meal. Beautiful room, excellent service. The oysters were the best I have had in my life- the waiter said they had just arrived today at noon and I could taste that it was true. They were so good I could barely believe it.The bison was excellent, with beautifully prepared vegetables- mushroom sauce and carrots, potatoes and asparagus.I almost never eat dessert, but I trusted the waiter and his suggestion of the flourless chocolate cake was worth making an exception for. I lingered over it for half an hour reading and was left in blissful quiet to enjoy.The people clearly take pride in the food and this meal made me sad I have to leave Montreal tomorrow. It also made me promise myself that I will be coming back.
