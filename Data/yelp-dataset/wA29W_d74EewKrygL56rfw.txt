1	If you don't mind your project taking months and months to be completed, if you don't mind paying a random number that pops into his head (no invoices), If you don't mind him going  thousands of dollars over quote, if you don't mind your yard 98% complete and then him quitting on you... this is the landscaper for you! Does beautiful work if you can get him to your home. I don't understand having to beg and plead for a custom home project to be completed and then not completed.... Worked on my home for 10 months and never completed the job. Now wants me to pay his final bill. Nervy to treat people like crap and then bill them for it! Has recently lost other job and key employees. Not reliable!
5	I have used Siesta on a handful of projects over the past five years. Yes, he is very busy, but a more reliable and honest person I have not found. I generally have to ask him if I owe him anything. I am surprised to read the other review because that does not sound at all like him. He has had people quit from time to time, but in that business, I think that is quite the norm. I have referred him to a number of friends and they all just love his work....
5	We got to watch Albert and his crew do our neighbors house. They landscaped their yard as a pool was being built. Alberts crew was very friendly to us and asked if they could come through our unfinished backyard with some of their larger equipment.  We met Albert and decided to use him to do our backyard. He and his crew went way above what I expected at a great cost. They never complained if we wanted something moved or changed and we couldn't be happier. They even helped me put some boxes up in my attic as it was too hard for me to do (no cost).  Always on time, always friendly and courteous, always reliable.
