5	Visited 11/09-11/10 weekend. Booked our rooms through our timeshare, but they booked the wrong day. So when we got to the hotel we didn't have reservations. The women at the front desk (Marie) was more then helpful and super friendly, very good customer service! She made our trip.  The rooms where good & I would definitely  return.
3	We went during spring break everything else was at least $69 more than this hotel in the area we were totally happy. Clean rooms, freshly painted building, pool and hot tub we're clean, great for the money. The two things that may be a deal breaker for some are that the building is old and noisy. Our neighbors across the hall poked their heads out the door when we came in late and we were not being loud. The showers are weak as well. would go again
4	A very reasonable stay for $78, considering that I had a king-size bed, quiet room (no paper-thin walls), good internet speed and adjacent to some of the main roads that had eateries. There is a Waffle House next door as well. I lucked out by staying here on the Monday where the NFL Arizona Cardinals were having their season opener on MNF. I fully expected the rate to be much higher due to the many San Diego Chargers fans that were traveling here as well as somewhat close proximity to the stadium in Glendale (15-20 min). Check-in was easy (less than 5 minutes), and there was ample parking around the building. Breakfast is offered in the morning as well. Not a bad continental breakfast option of waffles, fruit, cereal, coffee and juice. If traveling into Goodyear again, I'll certainly consider staying at this location again.
1	This was a last minute trip to Arizona and stayed here the room was non smoking but it smelled like cigarettes and the following morning went to get breakfast and one of the staff members had already unplugged by he waffle maker and said we can only have coffee and a Danish.. Wtheck it was before 9am..
