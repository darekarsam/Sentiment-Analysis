5	I used them as a result of calling 5 of the highest rated pest control companies on Angie's List. City Wide had the pest price on a single inside and outside spraying with no contract. We had a wide variety of bugs popping in from time to time and after the treatment the only bugs we have seen have been dead! The tech was very knowledgeable and professional. I had no problem letting this guy in my house and around my family. I also had him do a mosquito yard treatment while he was here. I will probably continue using them for the rest of the summer because my kids loved not being mosquito dinner. I will use them again for pest control if I see anymore creepy crawlers.
5	City Wide has provided exterminating services at my home for a few years.  I am SO impressed with their professionalism, promptness, friendliness, and overall customer service.  They show up when promised, provide quarterly telephone service reminders, and ALWAYS ask if any problems exist.  They have truly provided the most consistent customer service of any business with which I have had the pleasure of working.  Thank you and you can count on me as a long-term customer.  And of course, they always make certain my home is creature-free.
5	Fantastic job! I've had them out several times and they do great work.
5	I have known the owner since 1996 when he worked for a larger exterminating company.  So excited when he went out on his own.  We have been using him quarterly ever since!  Great family run business and overall great people.  I have referred him to tons of family and friends in the Charlotte area.  Can't speak highly enough!
