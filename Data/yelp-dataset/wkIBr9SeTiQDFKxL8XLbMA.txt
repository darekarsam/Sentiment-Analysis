5	I can't say enough good things about this business.They took over the communication with my insurance company once they had my car, and took care of everything. I was able to get a rental car right there, which made my life so much easier. My car was showroom beautiful when I got it back. You'd never know it was damaged. I got pictures sent to my cell every day once repairs started, and the staff was a dream to work with.I couldn't have asked for more!
5	I received premier customer service and am  more than satisfied with my experience with this establishment. The representative that worked with me was Glen Irish.  I work insane hours and it was difficult for me to get my vehicle in for service.  They came and picked up my car and delivered it back at no additional charge.  My car is back to showroom floor perfection.  They also guarantee their work for LIFE!
5	Needed some repair work done on a '96 Infiniti, in late 2011.  CCS was very willing to work with me on budget and still maintain a level of quality they were comfortable standing by.  Very pleased with the overall experience and definitely recommend.
5	Amazing customer service. Their work is top notch. I highly recommend this place. They took care of everything and kept me updated throughout the entire process.
