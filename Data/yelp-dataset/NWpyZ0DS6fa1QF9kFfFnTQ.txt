4	Kurt Geiger is the closest to Christian Louboutin I am ever going to get. The shoes around cheap, with most being around 100 pound but they are so pretty to look at. And 100 pound isn't too expensive if they are pretty to look at!I once got a pair for 30 pound reduced from a hundred. Lovely, and they were super comfy, the heel tips were metal so didn't need re-heeled after one wear. They were great until I walked through a muddy field and ruined them. But they were so pretty to look at! The sales in here are good, so best show up around sale time and grab a bargain. Did I mention they are pretty to look at?
5	This is a pretty large branch of Kurt Geiger, well, the largest branch I've come across anyway. I love the window display with stacks of shoes laid out in their own little box, if only I had a shoe library like that. I probably have enough shoes to do that, just not enough space in my overcrowded room.They have so many different styles from sandals, to platforms, to wedges, to really high stilettos. The shoes may be quite pricey but as other reviewers have mentioned, they often have sales on and they are darn good sales too with 50% off and more.I have a couple of pairs of Carvela shoes, my favourite pair have a fabric flower on the front and super high heels, I love them and as they are black, I can wear them with just about everything.
