3	Tough review to give, the price and cut were outstanding, these guys are really good at cutting hair. But conversation is profane and vulgar, which I didn't appreciate because my nephew is young. Even after the shop manager told them to stop it seemed like it just got worse. I will probably come back because the cuts are so good but will not take my nephew, I will probably contact the management about this.
2	I stopped going here and went back to Ray's. They are too vulgar and don't consider or respect women and  children. The last time I went they were listening to an uncensored Mike Jones CD. Pretty bad lyrics to have playing in a business. The guys are cool, but need some maturity and consideration for customers.
4	I was going to Rays until I gave this place a try and I love it! Sam (I think that's his name) gave me one of the greatest comb-overs to date. Love this place, great cuts!
