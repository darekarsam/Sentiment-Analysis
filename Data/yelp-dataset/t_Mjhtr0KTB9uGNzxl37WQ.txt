2	Service was okay, at best. I wouldn't go there again.  They quoted me at thousands of dollars of repairs for my car to pass inspection.  I took it somewhere else and had it done for a fraction of the quote.
1	Don't go. I got more problems and sounds on my car after I spent $800 there. unbelievable!
1	This place is looking to make money and rip you off.  The door of my car had a dent in it for over three years when I took it here for my annual inspection.  Never before did anywhere else have a problem with it, but this place said they would not pass it.  Weird how it passed inspection 3 times already with no other place mentioning the door being a problem.  Never giving this place any business again, I went to a different Meineke in Homestead where they are helpful and work with you.
5	Not sure why the negative reviews on here? I went there for brakes and got a great deal. They squeezed me in on short notice too since I was going out of town. I'll be going back for more work -- the guys here are great.
