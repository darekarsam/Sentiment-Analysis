5	Customer service was outstanding ... we were greeted immediately , asked what was our project and straight away in the most professional manner given answers and options ... The managment here is the best ive dealt with and will bend over backwards for your customer needs ... Thank you Dunn Edwards !
5	This is your store for all your home paint needs. This is the best paint you can buy for your house. Don't waste your time at the big box stores buying low quality paint.
1	Worst customer service of any paint store I've ever been in as I'm standing here being helped the guys goes into the back and started calling people.
