4	The staff at this Walgreens is amazing.  They are consistently friendly and helpful.  There is apparently a prescription program where you pay $20 a year per person, and after that your prescriptions are only up to $15 a script... This was the only store that told us about the program.  This saved us around $500 on just one prescription!The store has everything (from kitsch to Jim Beam), and everyone's pretty nice.  I would organize it a little better, but no biggie...
1	A full hour to fill a prescription. Seriously? I'll go somewhere else next time.
5	This review is solely regarding the cosmetics section of this store. My wife came here frequently to indulge in some of the newest products. The main woman at the cosmetics counter (sorry I forgot her name), was very friendly and always helped us find exactly what we were looking for! They were always ahead of the curve and very well stocked.I highly recommend shopping here for cosmetics!
5	Store is always very clean and they have very friendly employees and staff.  Like the new design that they did inside the store.  Keep up the great work
1	This Walgreens is horrible if you need to have a prescription filled or see a PA. They are rude and slow every single time. As I sit here typing this I'm waiting for my child to be seen. They open at 9:30 in a Saturday. The PA just walked in 10 minutes late and really couldn't care less that we are waiting. This has happened many times. We only go here when we have no other choice. Hopefully if they get enough poor reviews they'll shape up! I have edited my review down to one star. Why? Same as always terrible, TERRIBLE customer service. If you just need to pick up a few things, you're good. However if you need the pharmacy or the clinic-Beware! Not only will you wait a ridiculously long time, the PA's staff g the clinic are awful and rude. I went in a few months back and the PA refused to examine me. Turns out I had pneumonia. Nice work Walgreens!
