4	My convenience store of choice on the south side. It took me several weeks to realize that you can use your Giant Eagle rewards card here.
5	On 18th Street on the South Side....This is a great place. It is bright and pleasant, has a wide selection, free ATM, and the sandwiches I ordered here with my daughter were delicious. I chose the tuna with a little apprehension but I love tuna and was really in the mood. I could not believe how great it was. Fresh, plentiful, and high quality. Oh and the employees are really nice.
4	I remember when this was CrossRoads and actually had gas pumps. I must admit, smart move getting rid if the gas pumps and just being a convenience store.  That lot it sits on is just too small for all that was going on there.As far as the convenience part, it's spot on.  Able to walk in here and grab a snack or drink while you're walking the southside. Feels a bit safer walking the parking lot too. Not having to dodge all those cars is a plus.
1	Not sure if everyone that works here is on hardcore drugs or what but I literally felt like I was dealing with completely incompetent people. It took 35 minutes for chicken on bread. Yes, chicken on bread.  I live on 18th so it's a quick stop for me on my way home from work. NEVER will I stop here again. It is an absolute pathetic excuse for whatever you wish to call it.
