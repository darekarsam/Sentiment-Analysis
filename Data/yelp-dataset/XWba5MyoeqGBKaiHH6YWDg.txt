5	Yummy Thrifty ice cream, snowie treats, and world famous smoothies....
5	Found this place by accident. We love the Thrifty Ice Cream shop. We will be frequent customers here for both the ice cream and the bottled water.
5	This place, it's owners, their candy and ice cream selections and their deals are a godsend.  $19.95 got us a brand new 5 gallon jug with a spigot and wide mouth opening on top (perfect for Burning Man and other such summer festivals and makes it easy for putting ice and other things in it) filled with clean water and will only cost 25 cents a gallon to refill.  Owner assured me that they're working on securing Alkaline water also.  They sanitized the bottle for us before filling it and everything came with a friendly smile and little jokes here and there.  Great energy in this place.  Highly recommended!
2	Good place to get ice cream water whatever u need staff is awesome only downside is they don't have enough room to keep out all the ice cream flavor they have out so if u have a taste for something it may not be out
5	Love this place. Everything is always so amazing! Yum! The service is awesome too...very nice people.  Just wish they would expand to have more seating!
5	Awesome!!!! Love the old school candy and that Thrifty icecream Malted Crunch. There is an assortment of icecream to choose from. Chocolate covered cones and bowls and many toppings. Come get your water an ice and your favorite yummy treat. If your are a health nut then you will love there smoothies with your choice of supplements or just get a blizzard!
5	This place has the best ice in town. The employees are always friendly and the store is clean. The 20 lb. bags of ice appear to be a little over weight. And let's not forget the ice cream.
