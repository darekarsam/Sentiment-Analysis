5	This place is amazing one of the best shops I've ever seen. The guys were very knowledgable and the selection of products was second to none. I will definitely be a repeat customer.
5	Tyler was extremely helpful in picking out my new vaping kit.  Tons of flavors of juice for you to try before you buy.  Be ready to sit & sample for awhile!We will definitely be back.
3	I really like some of their juices, but it's just too overpriced for my taste. The shop is really great looking. I love their setup. When I first went in there were a few customers, but not that many. One of the employees was obviously making a sale so my boyfriend and I walked to the other side, where we could see the employee was mostly just standing their while a customer looked over things. After not being acknowledged for about ten minutes we ended up leaving. I'm not sure how much I care, but I do at least a little. My boyfriend and I just figured we'd come back later when they were super slow. We ended up giving money to other people who were heading over there and also have been gifted a few bottles. So we've never really come back. The only real reason why we kept buying from them was their delicious rose champagne flavor and their watermelon. Turns out another company makes a better version so I probably won't be returning. I know quite a few people who are loyal customers though. They're pretty great if you don't care how much you're spending.
1	I came here with my husband looking to spend some serious cash. However, there were two things that stopped me from doing so:1. The customer service was non existant. Not once was I asked if I needed assistance and we were the ONLY customers in the store. The guy just sat there and played the video game. 2. Every flavor I tried tasted burnt or old. When I looked in each of the samples, the e liquid was so old or burnt that it had hardened and turned brown. It was awful. I'll never return.
