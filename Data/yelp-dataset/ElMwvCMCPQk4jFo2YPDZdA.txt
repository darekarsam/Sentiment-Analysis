3	This review is a bit late in the making, the amphitheater at Station Square is a great place for watching concerts save for two things. 1) the trains that go by totally kill the sound, and B) the lousy plastic chairs they have in place for seats. Other that that, on a warm summer's eve, with that awesome Pittsburgh skyline right beside the stage and the band playing, it's hard to find a better venue. This particular night, myself and YFOJ (yoga friend of Joe) saw Asia (with all four original members) and Yes (I believe this was the 418 version of this band, with a lead singer who was hired for his awesome imitation of Jon Anderson from a YouTube video). It was a great night, I was transported back to the eighties. Ahh, the eighties, me barely twenty years old, big haired women, lousy one hit wonders from British rock bands who had no business cracking the top ten. A flock of seagulls, take on me, super groups like Asia, GTR, and after a ten year layoff from making music, Boston finally put out their third CD.Asia and Yes played for three solid hours, with Steve Howell wowing us with his awesome guitar work for both bands.
4	The Trib Total Media Amphitheatre at Station Square has been around in one form or another for the past 25 years.  I remember when I was a teen it was called the IC Light Amphitheatre and it was a temporary looking stage.  Next to it was the tent which was booked for smaller acts.  It's been in several locations in Station Square including the west lot, the east lot, etc.  It's also been known at various times as the Amphitheatre at Station Square, the Melody Amphitheatre, and the Chevrolet Amphitheatre.  It didn't operate between 2006 and 2009.It's a nice little facility to see a show.  The sightlines are way better than at First Niagara Pavilion.  Let's face it, the whole atmosphere is w-a-y better here.  Plus you don't have to drive all the way out to the boonies and you can eat and drink at Station Square before or after the show.  So you don't get gouged on parking or food and beverages.  The only thing I don't like is that because it's booked by Live Nation, it tends to get a lot of has beens---er I mean "classic rock acts from the 70s" (Chicago, REO, Doobie Brothers).  Every so often they get a good act though and I took my dad here last night as an early Father's Day gift.  We were sitting in section 117--granted a little towards the back but not too bad.  So faithful music fans....can you combine a concert with "Wheel of Fortune"?  Well if you're Declan McManus (you know him as Elvis Costello) you sure can.  Stage right he had the Spectacular Spinning Songbook, a roulette wheel, which was spun by various audience members, nearly all of them female (quel suprise) and not one of them me (of course not).  This concept really didn't work too well at first and Costello and the Imposters seemed to be a little shaky on that.  No matter, the rest of it was fantastic.  He opened up with "I Hope You're Happy Now" and then did such tunes as "Mystery Dance", "Radio Radio", "(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea", etc.  The "spin" songs included "You Tripped Up at Every Step", "Everyday I Write the Book", "Sulky Girl" & "Monkey to Man".  After a brief intermission, he did a lovely slow version of "Allison", which included a medley of "Tracks of My Tears" & "Tears of a Clown".  He also did "Watching the Detectives" and my personal favorite "What's So Funny About Peace, Love & Understanding."Elvis Costello is a very engaging performer and he's one of a few that have remained viable as he ages, not just content to sing the same old classics over and over.  Dad was into his early music and he remembers the time on SNL when Costello began playing "Less Than Zero" then actually stopped the show before going into "Radio Radio".  Me, I got into his music when I was a teen and "Veronica" became a huge hit.  So he transcends generations.And now I can safely say I've seen Elvis.
1	I will attempt to rate the venue itself as much as this region....Pittsburgh is one of  the worst town i have ever lived in to try and hear live music... I have lived in 10 cities in all... definately worst for live music.... Sadly, when the few folks who live here want music or a band... there are no remaining venues like trib bite the dust here.  Tribune review has the money...they just don't care!          Great place to live if you sit at home eat crappy food and your passion is nothing but sports ,sports ,sports!  I am going to move to a place//// anywhere usa ????where...they have twice the venues and way better food.  Bye trib amplitheatre your town stopped caring about culture and started caring about things I could NEVER relate too.  It is being replaced by yet another expensive sports arena.
