3	If you visit this little designer boutique outside of uptown you will probably walk out happy. Although small, they've got some pretty great items and are running sales often. I wasn't crazy about their jewelry selection - what they had was nice, it was just too small for me. The girls there seem to genuinely want to help you find the perfect piece of clothing, not just push a sale on you, which was refreshing. I'd check this place out if you're in the area.
4	After shopping in Fresh a handful of times, it's about time for a review! First of all, the girls who work here are incredibly friendly and helpful. Need to find a gift for less than $30? They'll get it done. Looking for a luxe cashmere wrap? They have it. How about fab clothing brands like Alice and Olivia, AG, Waverly Gray, Milly, House of Harlow and Hunter Dixon? Stocked and ripe for the picking. And lastly, they have an excellent selection of super affordable jewelry from Sylvia Benson, Molly Beads, Harper and more. I found some great gifty items for the upcoming holidays! And have I mentioned is smells fabulous in here?! Happy shopping all...and be sure to check out the sale selection in the back!
3	I love the clothes in this place but man, the prices are outrageous. I have purchased maybe 2 or 3 items ever here. The parking is terrible. Right off Providence and a total pain to get back on the road if you need to cross over. The traffic is heavy all the time. If you have money to burn then this is your place. You will look great.
5	Great shop for the perfect dress for an evening out! I'm a fan of their selection of Michael Stars and Velvet knits, too.
