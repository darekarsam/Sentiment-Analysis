1	Sorry Janice I went to Supercuts instead of to your place and I got a bad haircut. I think you spoiled me Janice. I admit they did not have much to work with but I am uglier than normal now.
5	Fast service and a great haircut for my husband.
5	My hubby and I have been going to this location for many years. The call ahead thing is great, minimal wait time. For a $15 haircut plus tip, they're great. Sad to see they closed on Christmas Eve.
5	Make sure you take advantage of the call ahead, about 30 minutes before you plan to be there! Great place to get a haircut for under $20. Have been going to this location for many years. Sad to see they closed on this Christmas Eve. Hope to follow my stylists at their new locations.
