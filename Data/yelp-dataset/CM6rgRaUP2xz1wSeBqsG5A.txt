4	New Hours! 9-430PM Mon-Fri only!
5	I just dropped two  Christmas cards with gift cards enclosed into mail drop at main post office. As they went down the chute I realized I hadn't put stamps on them.  To make a long story short, the postal supervisor is going to meet the mail handler as he empties the box and put stamps on them.  Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus and his spirit lives within the Post Office at their busiest time of year..
3	For convenience's sake, I come here because it's located in a gas station mini mart so I can pump gas and send my mail at the same time. However, the hours are less than convenient. They don't open until 9:30 which is after most people have to be at work (and in my experience they always open a few minutes late). They close at "4:30 PM" but really they close at around 4 PM or sometimes earlier because "the register has to be closed at 4:15". My understanding of business hours are that the last customer is taken at closing time, but apparently not according to this post office. I go back because it's right next to my house but I could do without the attitude.
