5	I'm not really rating this car rental company as a whole, but this particular location.  During a recent vacation to Scottsdale, we decided to reserve a car in town rather than pick up from an airport which was a much better experience in general.  Turns out about 30 other people had the same idea for the same date and time and that location only had about 4 cars.  From a customer standpoint, you would never know.  Our rep stayed upbeat and positive and even took extra time to explain the insurance policies that came with my credit card.  Because we reserved in advance, we were able to get a car within 10 minutes of the original time quoted, but the entire staff was working at full speed to get cars to everyone.  Another note:  rates and taxes were way better than what the airport locations quoted.
1	be careful this is not a franchise store. It is privately owned and have a whole different set of rules & practices. They can't find pass reservations if they were made at a corporate location. I had rented cars for weeks at a  time , and they couldn't find meor recorder. I had just rented in California the same month, won't honor a credit because of car being dirty & not fully gas. VERY IMPORTANT PRACTICE, THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME THREE.  THE RENTAL RATE ON MY CARD AS A HOLD DUE TO THE FACT THEY HAD GOTTEN BURNED IN THE PAST. THIS WAS FOR A COMPACT FOR THE WEEKEND RENTAL OF $78 ORGINALLY I didn't know this until I arrived , it wasted all kinds of time .
1	Worst customer service EVER!!! Treated me and my mom both horribly! The manger, Kevin Orr, was a total jerk! Never, ever using enterprise again EVER!
