5	This place was recently bough by a new owner. the store has then improved a lot. they now offer a lot new products at good prices...
5	Walk in not knowing what's inside the store. Then started walking around. Pretty much all of the item I need from walmart, they have it. And not only that but they 5x cheaper. So I didn't hesitate but buy what I needed from this store. Friendly cashier, really amaze how they have everything that you could possibly need. My shop is literally 5 minutes away if I needed something.
5	This place is the best,  it reminds of Benny's or Ocean State Job Lot (Rhode Island) stores. They carry my favorite soda!  I bought a ton of stuff for cheap. ED HARDY picture with frame $30. New conversation piece for the home.  Great finds for under $2 in here.  I bought the made in China waist trainer for $2. It helps keep my posture.
