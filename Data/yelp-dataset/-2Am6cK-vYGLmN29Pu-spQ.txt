4	Mary's offers custom tailoring and alterations for men's and women's clothing.  They also make bridal gowns, prom & quinceanara dresses, and baptismal clothing as well. Service is always courteous, reasonable priced and everything has always been ready at time promised, and done to my satisfaction.  Hemming men's pants is I think $9, and Mary saved an expensive comforter with a well-sewn patch for $5.  Only drawback: somewhat limited business hours. Stated on the business card as Monday, Thursday, Friday, 8-5 P.M. and Saturday 8 A.M.-2 P.M., Call to confirm those are current hours, but note those hours a little flexible depending on how busy they are - so you might want to call ahead before making a special trip.  Payment by cash only.
3	Although staff was friendly, it was too pricey for my taste. To fix a couch cushion, they quoted me $25 for the zipper itself. I ended up buying a upholstery zipper online for $4, and fixed it myself.
