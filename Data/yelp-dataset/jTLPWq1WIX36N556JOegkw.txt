2	A very nice traditional French bistro. We went for breakfast with our friend Alan, who has been coming here for over 20 years. Owned by the same family for nearly 60 years, the food and the atmosphere was very nice. We ate outside on the terrace which was landscaped beautifully with ivy and flowers. The service was terrible here. We had to ask twice for coffee refills, water, and even silverware. The wait staff seemed preoccupied.The menu was traditional French. I had a country dried ham baguette sandwich which was very nice. Denis had the omelette. Again the food was great, service lacking.

This resturant has fantastic cusine, great service, and ambience!!  at a very reasonable price!  We will definetely go back every time we are in Montreal!
