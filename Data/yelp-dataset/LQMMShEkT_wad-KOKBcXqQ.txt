4	This is a cute little shop with a variety of non-essential knick knacks and other various gift shop items. Overpriced, but in line with what you would expect with other strip offerings. This is a cute little shop to wander through while you're enjoying everything the Linq has to offer. Definitely check out the accessories wall, but it's definitely geared towards tourists.
