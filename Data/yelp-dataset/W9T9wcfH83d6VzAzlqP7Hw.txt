4	City Vintage is sparsely laid out for what is effectively a store selling antiques. It is, however, quite refreshing, since I am used to having to battle my way through ornaments and a few feather dusters before I can get to the good stuff.It's nice to raid places like that but it's also nice to not feel like a bull in a china shop once in a while. City Vintage by contrast is a lot more spacious. The airy, pleasant surroundings make it easier to browse without your brain feeling cluttered, and it also gives them a chance to showcase their best stock.They seem to collect very desirable, timeless pieces of furniture and accessories that with forever be deemed as classic. They have some gorgeous, decorative separating partitions for changing rooms, trunks and a number of chintzy ornaments. Like Lisa, I am also a big fan of their brooches.My only complaint is they're not open enough during the week, but for locals the weekend opening times are reasonable enough that you could afford some time to browse if you were nearby. I would say it's worth travelling to if you're an avid fan of all things old and tasteful! City Vintage pluck out goods of the highest class and it's nice to visit a vintage store who specialise in appliances and furniture rather than clothing, for a change.
