1	This place SUCKS.  The pharmacist and his assistants are EXTREMELY condescending and prejudiced about older people.  My sister's friend was treated extremely horribly by these people and they never apologized, they just said "we get a lot of elderly people in here so we often lose our patience."  They still have not apologized when they lost her insurance card.  If you want to be treated with respect and have competent, respectful service, DO NOT get your prescriptions here.
5	When I was younger, my friend and I went to this CVS and started interviewing strangers on camera.  ("Have you ever been to Alaska?" "What color are your socks?")  We used to spray BOD all around.  We painted ourselves blue from head to toe and acted casually.  We were terrors.  They put up with us, and now I am a loyal customer in return.  I've never once had a bad experience.  I live close, so I roll on over whenever I want a new nail polish color.  As decisive as my motives are, it takes me at least a half hour to choose each time.  They have a lot of colors.
