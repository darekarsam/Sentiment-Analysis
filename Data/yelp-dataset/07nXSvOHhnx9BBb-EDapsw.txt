4	Jamba is not your average smoothie spot, they offer juice based smoothies.........vegetable and or fruit......the choice is yours.  Fresh quality ingredients is their standard, and after having the pumpkin smash smoothie I tend to agree.  Like their smoothie competitors, they offer different 'boosts/shots'.  Unlike their competitors they offer hot breakfast wraps(egg whites, yay!), oatmeal,  yogurt, etc.  Jamba Juice is a breath of fresh air to the smoothie scene, I just hope they can survive uptown in this economy.......
5	What can I say? It's Jamba Juice. That's all that's needs to be said. My cousin first exposed me to them in NY back in 2008. Since then I've have always craved their smoothies. They make the best smoothies in the world to me. When I was in Seattle for 2wks I was a Jamba Juice. When I found out there was on in Madison, WI. I found reasons to drive 2hrs to go to Madison. When I had leave Charlotte and go back to WI for work the only thing that made my return trip back good was going to the Jamba Juice in the airport. So I'm so happy that there's a Jamba Juice that doesn't require me to have an airline ticket. Thank you BOA for putting a Jamba Juice in your building. Go have a smoothie there and see why I'm crazy about them. You will not be disappointed.
4	Perfect location inside the BofA plaza and has a wonderfully helpful staff.  It can be a little tricky to find this spot but it is right next to Ivy & Leo and City Barbers.The best smoothie is the Aloha Smoothie with a boost of the Daily Vitamin.  You cant go wrong here if you ask for the "light" version.  You are talking about only 250 calories and a delicious island treat.  It has Pineapple, Banana, Strawberry, and yogurt in it.  It is by far my favorite.  Enjoy!-Ian M.
4	Great staff, with a variety of great options, smoothies to wraps and other snacks. I chose the Banana Berry Breeze, it was great. A nice, healthy alternative to breakfast, but also a great mid-day snack option.
