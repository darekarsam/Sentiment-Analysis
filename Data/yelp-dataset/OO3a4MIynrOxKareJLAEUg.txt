3	For a brand new place that seems to be run by a very young staff I was pleasantly surprised. The girls were friendly and knew they were doing. I enjoyed my time there and enjoyed the service I received. I actually bought a coupon on Groupon to try this place out and was pleasantly pleased.
4	I stumbled in here because it is conveniently close to where I live and was quite pleased with my experience.  The hairdresser I had was very friendly and did a good job with my hair.  Their prices are competitive with other salons I've been to.
1	I went to Posh Salon in Jarry East for a pedicure.  The service was okay. What extremely annoyed me was that the polish for some of my right toes were at least 4 millimetres from the cuticle! The color was unevenly coated. Some toe nails being darker than others.  Two toes looked like there was only one coat of polish! Like, seriously?  I understand she was in a rush, but seriously?  Very shoddy work.  Will never go back.  My mistake was not checking her work before leaving believing that she was a professional.
