4	My GF introduced me to this place yesterday.  I was pleasantly surprised.We ordered one of that A, B, C type dish for 2.We went for the A i think and traded one of the dish offered for something else (1$ extra).The order consisted of 3 dish and a generous serving of rice.  We had the spicy boiled beef with veggies, spicy pork and a nice plate of veggies.  All that stuff for 30$.The place seems quite popular with Concordia Chinese students.  I really enjoyed my time there and the meal was delicious!  If you like Szechuan, i recommend this place.
5	I've ordered delivery here twice and both times were great. Delivery was fast and the food was fresh and tasty.Have tried the Fried Squid Balls, Chicken with Spicy Sauce & Cumin, and Boiled Fish Filet & Vegetables In Spicy Sauce. All delicious.The portions are large, as is the menu selection. Looking forward to ordering in the future.
1	I bought a voucher for this place from one of the deal sites. They accidentally crossed of my name on their list showing that my voucher was already used when it hadn't been. They then proceed to tell me that their verification method was fool proof (how can it be when nothing is scanned and everything is manually checked off by hand?) Then they tried to prove that the voucher I brought in was a photocopy reproduction (it wasn't, it was printer from a printer). All in all, a terrible experience, tried to make me out to be a thief. Why would I even go through all that trouble and reproduce a very "real looking" fake voucher to save $10?!? At the end they realized their mistake. By then I had already 25 mins of my time and my order had already gotten cold. There were no apologies from the restaurant. The food was also very salty and the bubble tea was very chalky. They use powered coffeemate to cream their teas which has a huge taste difference from actual condensed or fresh milk. With all the Chinese food options in that area, I know I will never go back to this place.
