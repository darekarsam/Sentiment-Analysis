3	Honestly didn't know what to expect from this place.I ordered the pad seew and everything was made fresh just like a Thai Express. The dish smelt nice but unfortunately chef was either a bit too generous on the oyster sauce or salt. It came out too salty. Obviously I would have liked it with less salt and a tad on the sweet side would be nice. Overall I would try this place again; mistakes can happen. Until then, this place is only a meh to me.
2	So I was pretty hungry once and came in this fairly new restaurant which was close to me. The cook was pretty nice, and the place was empty, sort of a grey atmosphere. I don't think one is meant to eat in this place - take-out seemed like the way to go.I wanted to check it out, so I got the Pad See Ew, for $10, which honestly, is very pricey. (literally everything is $10) The taste was decent, but the dish didn't pick up any flavor from the wok. The braised bits of beef were okay though. The amount he gave really cheesed me though. If you pay $10, it's fair to assume you should be getting a good amount, but the bowl was half full. I understand why almost no one goes here. Thai Express is literally down the street and 2-3 bucks cheaper, a generous portion and honestly, tastes better - which is pretty sad. They claim to provide an authentic taste, but really, none of that was communicated to me through the dish, and I've been to Thailand.Overall, if you're a student or not - save your money and just go to the Thai Express if you want something vaguely resembling Pad Sew.
