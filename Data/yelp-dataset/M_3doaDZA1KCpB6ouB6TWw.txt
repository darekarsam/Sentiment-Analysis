5	Licari's is right next to the Super  8 hotel for wayward travelers who meant to stay closer to downtown Madison. It's delightful and within walking distance for those who want to get wasted and wander back to the hotel.They have Spotted Cow on tap! Also if you ask for a double mixed drink it comes in a 16 ounce beer cup!!! awesome!!!!Don't go there on Sunday if you are rooting for a team that is playing a Wisconsin team. We almost got heckled out of the bar. Awkward.On the other hand, we got free chicken wing snacks during the game! (once everyone got over our Northwestern sweatshirts...)Don't play darts. very confusing dart machine. bartenders are very local!
5	Very nice family run bar.Burgers are great. Fries are crispy and thin. They offer a full bar menu, chicken wings (boneless or bone in), chicken sandwich, burgers, steak, brats, hotdogs, etc. Try the Mac & Cheese bites. Sounds weird but they are really good! 5/5 peeps!
3	The place is clean, the staff is friendly and the prices are quite reasonable.However, this place is just average. Hidden behind Firehouse Subs, it is a great place for a casual, quick lunch. I order a cheeseburger with swiss. I was not asked what I wanted temperaturewise. They have several side options which include chips and various mayo-type salads. I upgraded to fries. I was a little disappointed I did this. They were standard crinkle cut. Not very impressive. A lunch for two under $20 is probably standard. So try this place when you are looking for a simple burger or sandwich. I would definitely go back again for a quick bite.
