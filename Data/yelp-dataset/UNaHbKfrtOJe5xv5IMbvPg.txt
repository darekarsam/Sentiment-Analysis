1	I have been to this restaurant several times because it is near the place I train. However, I don't think I will ever come back. We went there for supper with a big group. We were the only customers in the restaurant so you would expect good service. We waited for an hour before we were served. 15 minutes later, the waiter asked us if we were done and ready to pay. Really?
3	This used to be my main restaurant go-to back in my college days with my buddies! The restaurant hasn't change at all, other than new owners. The chef, thankfully, has remained the same. We ate mostly vegetarian (I ordered Saag Paneer - not so great).This is an ok Indian restaurant, well placed if you are on Parc Avenue, go to McGill or live in the McGill Ghetto. The service is nice, the restaurant quiet and child friendly! I do miss the burners they had to keep the food warm, however the quality was good.Yes, you can get better Indian food elsewhere (on Jean Talon) but this will do and the memories that it brought back were immeasurable. :)
3	BEST NAAN. Authentic curry, with the exception of their butter chicken (way too sweet). It is rather expensive for what you get. It'd be nice if their curry orders included either naan or rice.
2	About 45 minute wait for the food, which was cold when it arrived. The waiter wasn't very polite or helpful. The food was just ok; the butter chicken was too sweet. Expensive for the amount and the quality of the food.
