1	Kevin Vale and Michael Baker are distracted professionals.They do not have the time to adequately represent their clients.They let the other attorneys run right over them. Do not waste your hard earned money on this firm.
5	Kevin J. Vale has helped me tremendously with my case... Finally, this whole settlement has come to an end and I can move forward with my life. Thank you Kevin for all of your professional assistance.... (fist bump)
5	I had a great experience dealing with Michael from the Baker Law Firm. I tried to get my conviction set aside on my own and it did not work. I called the Baker Law Firm and they immediately put my mind at ease. I called around to multiple different groups and this was by far the best price. One thing I liked about Michael was that he immediately jumped on the case and made sure everything was on time. My case did not need much attention; it was only filing paper work, however the confidence they had in winning the case and the punctuation they used in filing the paper work was amazing. I would definitely recommend this firm again.
5	I highly recommend Michael Baker. He was very professional and honest. He always returned my phone calls and emails quickly. Eve his assistant was very professional and helpful on the phone. I couldn't have asked for a better attorney. I would use him again in a second.
