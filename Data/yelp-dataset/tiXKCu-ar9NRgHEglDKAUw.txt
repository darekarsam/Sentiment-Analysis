5	This might be our new romantic spot. The linguini and clam sauce was divine as was the biscotti cake. The server was pretty and efficient and the insides of the place were total class.
5	Lunardi's is a hidden gem nestled in the Beechview neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The ambiance, and the family that owns and operates it, makes you feel as if you just strolled into a restaurant in Little Italy. Our waitress went above and beyond to make our visit there memorable. Most importantly, we really enjoyed our meal! We had the greens and beans as well as the polpettes as appetizers. We loved both dishes. We had the Linguini Diavolo and the Linguini and CLam Sauce as our main courses. We found both to be superb! They also have a full bar which was unexpected and we took advantage of it. It was really nice to enjoy a martini while listening to some Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. The owner was there and he was warm and friendly. The prices were quite reasonable for the quality of the meal and the overall experience. We will definitely be returning to Lunardis!
