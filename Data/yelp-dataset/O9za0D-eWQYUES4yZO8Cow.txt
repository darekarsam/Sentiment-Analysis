3	"Am wantin a kilt like fir ma brither's weddin an that ken."I'm undoubtedly the least patriotic Scot on the planet, and so the chances of me ever being found kilted up and drunkenly brandishing a skee "n" doo at a wedding are more or less non-existent. However, I am in need of a new suit and smart shoes, as due to the end of my contract at work in a few months I'll likely have to endure a few job interviews. I thought Cristopher Ross might be able to help me out.They couldn't. Heaven for kilt lovers, useless for anyone else.
