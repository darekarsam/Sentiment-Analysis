1	If I could give this place no stars I would. I had newly relocated to the city and was dying to try barre so I bought their groupon. The instructor was late and we waited outside I'm the freezing cold in the dead of winter, class was not challenging at all, she used her phone for music and it continued to get interrupted by text messages. I thought maybe this was a fluke so I went a second time and it was equally as awful. Pay a couple extra dollars and go to barre bee in shady side.
4	I love Adrenaline Barre! This is the only workout I actually look forward to lately. The strengthening barre and cardio barre classes are both fun and challenging. Classes are a bit pricey but if you're lucky enough to use a coupon or other discount, then you'll be super happy. Arrive early to find parking.
5	I've been taking classes from Adrenaline Barre since it was located in Mt Washington. The instructor is friendly and passionate about her classes. She even offers FREE boot camps on Saturday mornings and sends fun perks if you sign up for her emails. The classes are challenging and convenient for those who work the 8-5 schedule. You won't regret dropping in for one of the classes!!
