4	Cozy best Italian place in downtown Montreal. I go more than once a week for lunch and have brought groups in for dinners often. What a great welcome from the owner and the best service not to mention the food that is always so delicious. Valeria, the owner, will also suggest excellent wine choices and will be happy to accommodate any allergies (to gluten, cheese, etc) if you tell her of it, and even better, she will remember your preferences the next time you come.Pasta mostly but also osso bucco, fish and meats all excellently prepared by a great team in the restaurant's open kitchen. This place is not only good for the stomach, it is amazing for the heart as it is like going to a lovely Italian aunt who is very happy to see you!This place is a little hard to find as it is located in a hotel but is 100% worth it.Enjoy!
4	Tiny restaurant, small menu, huge portions of good food. They treat guests like family.  Bring out bruschetta before the meal. Followed the meal with little Italian cookies and fresh fruit.  Made something at my sons request that was no longer on the menu.
3	Okay, but not great.Probably more like 2.5 stars.Ambience: Pretty ordinary.Service: Friendly waiter.Food: Meh. I had the seafood pasta which would have been very good but for having about 5X too much garlic (and this coming from a garlic fan). The accompanying bread was dry and tasteless.Price: I'm sure you could find better elsewhere for the same price.In short, nothing special and I'd be unlikely to go back.
2	Skip this place.   Sweet owner, good wine, great attitude, however extremely sub par food.  Red sauce was ehhhh at best.  Fish  of the day was unimpressive and the accompanying salad had wilted greens.We didn't risk dessert.  You can do better
