5	I've been using the place for 4 years.... staff is friendly and helpful. I have not had any problems with them.
5	I needed a document Notarized and called around my area to find a very friendly person behind the other end at Alpha Mailbox. Artie answered my questions and was super helpful! Once I arrived I noticed this place has tons of cute little trinkets and fun things to look at while waiting in line. When it was my turn I was helped promptly and with a smile and a apology for my wait. Artie gave excellent service and was able to notarize my item quickly and with ease. I paid 5$ for one signature if you need more then one it is 2$ for each additional. I definitely recommend this place!
