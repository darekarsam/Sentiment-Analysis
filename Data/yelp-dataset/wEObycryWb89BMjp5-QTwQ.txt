4	I have had no problems making appointments with our family doctors, and no problems with billing. There is rarely a wait of more than 5-10 minutes, and most of the time our appointments are right on time which was not the case when we had UW docs.  The other plus is that my son's psych doctors haven't switched every 6 months or so- UW is a  "learning hospital" and apparently that extends to the clinics. It was like UW couldn't keep doctors there, and I was sick of being asked if it was "ok" if somebody else observe my son during his visits- it was like the focus was on their learning docs and not on the patient.  I digress... this clinic is clean, there are two elevators that aren't so slow you could take the stairs faster, the pharmacy is right there and they have nice tables and crayons and a few toys for little kids to keep them entertained. We used the optical service there once, and we had no problems but it sounds to me somebody just had a bad doctor experience. I am happy so far and we have had this insurance about 3 years- I am glad to have a doctor older than 40 with some experience- their specialists are top notch imho- neuro psych, psych, pediatric ophthalmology are just some of the docs besides our family docs I have been pleased with.
