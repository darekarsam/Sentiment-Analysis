4	Definitely a fan! It's great having a place around the corner that I can get all my work stuff done at. The best thing I like about this store is that the employees actually try to get to know you and help you with whatever you need. Whenever I come in, they have a copy key and UPS envelopes waiting for me, it's great getting that personal service!
3	Stopped in with a large box to find out how much it would cost to ship it. The gal behind the counter was friendly, efficient and speedy. I was sorta sad that I couldn't give her that business right away. Soon, though.
3	An ok store.  Not great, not terrible.  They ship stuff, and charge you for it.
