3	Its Rite Aid. It's close to my house.This location closes a way too early in my opinion. If you're in a rush...I would avoid coming into this location during rush hour. Little old ladies are cute but when I need to get to work and there's 5 people ahead of me and you're moving as slow as paint dries...ehh...no thank you. That just leaves me irritable and well late for work.
3	I have to side with the two other reviewers and say that this Rite-Aid is totally average and serviceable if you live within the neighborhood. I actually much prefer other Rite-Aids in Shadyside and the one on Baum, but this place is so close and convenient. The little old ladies are indeed really slow and please do avoid right before 9 and after 5. You will have to wait quite a while to get something that you need.
5	Granted the older ladies are extremely sweet. I personally don't think that they really move that slow.  I think we just got spoiled and except fast fast fast!!!!!!One super nice guy name is Dave( I think that his name is Dave if it is not then it may be Dan). He is super nice whether he is assisting a customer on the phone or in person,
