4	Excellent copy services,cheap scans,alot of staff to help on the floor.and they have trail mix.plus its across the street from my work,sign up for the staples reward cards,it actually helps and save me alot,stay classy yelpers
3	If I need any office supplies, this is where I usually go. The aisles are easy to navigate around, and service is friendly.  Prices are competitive.  They have a Rewards Card system, but it's a bit nebulous to me how they determine when you have earned enough for a reward.
5	had a rush copy/print job today, Sunday, and Kayla was on the copy counter taking care of business - multiple customers, giving another employees guidance on 2 projects and she very professionally and quickly took care of my order.  I normally see maria in this department (also very qualified, professional)...so glad to have met Kayla and appreciate her help.
4	Their copy department is rad. Good service and reasonable pricing for quick print jobs.
5	Great customer service! I needed to get a couple chairs and they helped me get it all out to my truck.
1	Today is the last time I will ever use a Staples again!  I walked in there were two clerk's standing there talking to each other. I asked the the guy if he could help me find these items we all know when it comes to ink cartridges there are hundreds to choose from but only one will work with your printer. He  just looked at me and then said they are on the wall as for the other items he was just as helpful. So after looking over the inks I still couldn't find the ones I needed. The assistant manager was standing in the corner. I asked him if he could help me. His response was " WITH WHAT!" In a very snippy tone. WOW. NEVER AGAIN! !
