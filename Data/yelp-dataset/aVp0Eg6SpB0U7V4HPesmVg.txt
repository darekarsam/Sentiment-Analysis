5	Our property management team has pegged Dale and Clearly Clean Carpets as one of our preferred vendors for carpet cleaning services in the east valley.  We have sent Dale out to perform several property turn over cleaning jobs including one in which he made a former foreclosure which had seen better days rent ready with his thorough deep cleaning.  You can expect professional service, courteous scheduling and affordable carpet cleaning services from Dale and Clearly Clean Carpets.
5	I wish that I would have found Clearly Clean 9 years ago. I have not had the best luck with other carpet cleaners. I will never consider going anywhere else. Dale's work ethic is impressive. I have seen my carpet cleaned by many other carpet cleaners, watching the way my carpets were cleaned by Dale was so different. He took his time and did not rush, and the results speak for themselves. Our carpets look amazing!
5	I hired Dale from Clearly Clean recently and was very impressed.  As others have mentioned, Dale has an exception work ethic, arrived on time, and meticulously cleaned my upstairs carpeting and my stairs.  My carpeting has never looked better after being cleaned.  I give him and his company the strongest of recommendations.  I will certainly call him when my carpets need cleaned in the future.
5	I am so very pleased with the quality of both the customer service and the work of Clearly Clean Carpets.  Friendly, professional, honest, thorough and well-priced - what more could you ask for?  I'll be a loyal customer for a long time to come.
5	Dale at Clearly Clean is a life, ok, carpet saver!  Our daughter moved back home with a puppy and my carpet was replaced last year, it's still new.  We couldn't get rid of the smell no matter how many times  we tried.  Dale not only got rid of the smell but my carpets look wonderful.   We have had an area rug in the kitchen for years now, Dale made it look new again.   No more stains! Thank you Dale!
