5	The staff is always helpful and you can't beat the prices and selection. The location doesn't hurt either.
5	Great small pet store. The staff is always very knowledgeable and helpful. The prices are very good, but the selection is not as big as some larger pet stores.
5	Love this place! People working there were helpful and I bought lots of things at very good prices. We even had our 3 dogs bathed, nails trimmed & glands done for $75!!! Highly recommended this chain of pet stores.
