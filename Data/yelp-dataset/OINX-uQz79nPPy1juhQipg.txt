1	This place sucks. I mean Burger King is what it is, but the customer service was a nightmare. Went on several occasions hoping for a different outcome and each time I had to wait more than 10 minutes for "Fast Food". Meanwhile the employees were just hanging around. I'm not going back to that place and strongly recommend to find somewhere else if you're considering this place.  Otherwise good luck!
1	Very slow. Poor customer service. Dried out breakfast crossaint sandwiches that must've been made an hour earlier and have wilted under the heat lamps. On several occasions they've run out of tater tots, which boggles my mind. They premake crossainwiches by the tens, yet save making hash rounds until five minutes after the customer orders them?I've been here over ten times simply because it's on my commute and I thought it would be quick. Each time I go, I think it will be better. It never is. This morning was the last time I'm doing this to myself. I deserve better.
