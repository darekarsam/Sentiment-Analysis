3	WESA, the former WDUQ is Pittsburgh's first all NPR radio station located at 90.5 on the FM dial. Pittsburgh now can listen to news from the BBC, locally produced programming, and NPR produced programming.
2	Four stars for their schedule of national shows (good schedule choices - most of the best national public radio shows).  One star for their local content.  I'm rounding down to two stars, though, since I can stream national shows - I don't need a local station for that.Local content is pretty weak (with the exception of The Allegheny Front).  Most of their "news" time is spent on local press releases, leaving little time for coverage of stories that might actually have an impact on listeners.  (They also do this annoying thing of eating up big chunks of Morning Edition during the week by playing whole segments from Wait Wait Don't Tell Me.)  Their flagship noon current events show, Essential Pittsburgh, spends most of its time covering issues that have little Pittsburgh/PA connection - seriously doubt that 1/3 of the show's time is spent on local stories.  (Don't get me wrong - lots of the guests are local, but that doesn't magically turn a national or international issue into a Pittsburgh story.  ...And a British musician playing a show in town is not a "local arts" story.)  The show's business news rarely covers major local firms, and their travel segments are mostly on destinations outside of western PA.  So, everything you can get by streaming other NPR stations is good.  The piece that can only be provided by a local station - actual, relevant local content - is sorely missing.
