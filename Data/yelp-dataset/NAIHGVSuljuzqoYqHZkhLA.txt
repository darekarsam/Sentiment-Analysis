1	My knee replacement in 2011 by Dr. Koe was described by another specialist as the "worst surgery I have ever seen".  I had to get the knee replacement done over again 6 months after the original surgery with extensive reconstructive titanium rods put in my legs.
5	Came here after a botched healing process from another Vegas ortho. I had a pretty bad patella break that was still not healed 9 months later. My GP referred me to him after having his own knee worked on by Dr. Koe. The staff here is wonderful! The ladies that work in the front and assist Dr. Koe in the back office are so nice, patient, and friendly. I had recently switched insurance companies before coming here, and they were quick to help me with the transition and getting all my correct approvals. Dr. Koe is great as well. He diagnosed a lot of other damage that was missed by my previous ortho and sat with me to thoroughly go over the MRI and X-Rays. He also helped me a lot with my pain management regiment. My previous ortho just tried to load me with pills, which is neither safe nor effective. Dr. Koe gave me far better options that did not entail pill popping. He's also very nice, sympathetic, and funny, which makes such a huge difference to someone in pain. I will continue going to see him for my patella fracture. I have the utmost faith that he will do a fantastic job if I do need surgery. Another review to follow if that is the case.
