4	Finally, the fro-yo DIY movement comes to the South Hills.This place is fairly new, it just opened in early August. There are six flavors of frozen yogurt - you've got the original tart and then the fun flavors like vanilla, birthday cake, etc. I wish there were more flavors to choose from and there were smaller dishes, not the gigantic one size fits all dish. After you fill your cup up to your heart's content, you head to the toppings bar where you can choose from a good twenty some toppings (if not more) to add to your dish. There are sugary toppings like chocolate chunks, cheesecake bites and m&ms along with fruit toppings like strawberry and mango. Something for everyone here.After you've pulled together your dish, you head to the register and pay. And hold your breath that you did not go too overboard. The cost is .45/ounce, which seems a little pricey to me - I've been to other cities where its like .39/ounce. I filled up half my bowl and it ended up costing me about $3.25.The decor is fun and fresh. There is some seating inside and a table or two outside. Overall, I'm glad to see a new biz pop up on 88 and I love that delicious fro-yo is only a short drive away from me, which could be dangerous.

It's not part of a chain, but owner locally, and the flavors, toppings, and atmosphere are quite nice.Fro-Yo - Great! They didn't skimp here. It definitely tests well against Razzy Fresh.Toppings: Everything great. Two sizes of cups.Cafe: Simple, bright, and clean.Only negative: Cash only. This unfortunately, is a huge negative. My roommate and I have skipped going here several times because we aren't cash-carrying people (and most my age as well).
