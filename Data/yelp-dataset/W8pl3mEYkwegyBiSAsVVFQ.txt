4	Recently moved from Camden, Now located next door to Lark & Key.  We checked it out Friday and it is a great new space, located where Modern Fabrics used to be. Looks Great!  Good Move!  This Gallery has a Mosaic specialty and the current exhibit is Food Inspired!
4	Dropped in during the SouthEnd Gallery Crawl and was pleasantly surprised. Ciel is unpretentious and really quite welcoming.  The gallery had a few really neat pieces ranging in scale and price from around ten dollars for handcrafted pins using vintage buttons to large mosaics in the hundreds. The most striking pieces are in the windows, glass mosaics that catch the light. The gallery also has space in the back for classes.If you're in the neighborhood, give it a good half hour to see all the stuff.
4	Began and ended my South End Gallery Crawl (1st Fri of each month) at Ciel. They are constantly rotating their shows (primarily mosaics),so it's worth stopping in once a month. Their new location is a big improvement over the old space.
