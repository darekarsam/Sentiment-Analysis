4	Great pizza! Thin crust, lots of cheese (mix of mozzarella and provolone), and great toppings on the Hawaiian. It was nice finding somewhere that serves Canadian Bacon instead of ham on the Hawaiian pizza. The breadsticks were awesome--it was like a hunk of focaccia bread.  Nice atmosphere. Enjoyed hearing a band play. Who knew such a great place was tucked away in the Lincoln square mall!
5	I've eaten here once and got take out once.  The salad was good and fresh and I really liked the pizza.  It a very thin crust, which I love and a good sauce.  It's a good place to bring kids too. Reasonable prices.
5	Love this place, the buffalo chicken pizza is awesome...thin crust, plenty of blue cheese and hot sauce...perfection! Friends have had the sandwiches and salads and all reports were positive. Nice atmosphere, much nicer than most pizza places. Give it a try!
