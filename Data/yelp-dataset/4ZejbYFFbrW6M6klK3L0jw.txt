5	Recently had my phone customized by Andre at iTech Customs and I must say it was a great experience! You can tell he loves what he does by how focused he is on his work. He's very friendly and informative - definitely knows his stuff! Said it would take an hour, but 45 minutes later my phone was finished. I'll definitely be back if I need anything else done. Highly recommended if you need repairs or customizations!
5	Reasonable fast service :) would recommend to all in their cell needs. Friendly workers, convenient location. Great place to wait for ur phone as tons of booths to keep you occupied. Hopefully I personally do not have to come back soon lol but would recommend!!!!!
5	Have nothing but good things to say about iTech Customs. Andre is always very helpful and does a great job. Fixed three of our phones already. Would recommend this place for anyone who needs their phone fixed.
