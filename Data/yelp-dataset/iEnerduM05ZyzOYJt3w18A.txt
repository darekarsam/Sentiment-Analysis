5	Holy beautiful beads!  What an amazing and unique store to stumble upon!If you're into making your own jewelry, this is thee store for you.  There's just rows and rows of beautiful beads from different parts of the world.  Really, anything and everything you can think of from pearls, to amethyst to crystals and many many more is right in front of you to purchase.  Of course, this type of hobby will probably set you back a pretty penny...but I'm sure if you're investing in these pieces you're going to be making some gorgeous jewelry!If you are not into making your own jewelry but love unique and one of a kind pieces, this store is ALSO the store for you!  They have amazing handcrafted necklaces, bracelets and earrings.  But what really caught my eye was the incredible rings.  Maybe because they were actually in my kinda sorta price range, but again, they were just so unique.  Stone rings, glass rings, crystal rings.If you're heading to Shadyside, you have to stop in to be hypnotized by the jewels!
1	The owner stole a bracelet brought in for repairs and has lied over and over about returning it.
3	Very nice inventory, as others have said. The company has been, however, very slow in resizing jewelry items purchased at the store, and failed to meet promised deadlines in performing resizing.
2	2 woman in the store were very helpful and knowledgable. I haven't received my piece yet and its been about 5 days. Iffy about who owns the place but, ill see what the end product will be once I was receive it. If it approves I will change my rating
