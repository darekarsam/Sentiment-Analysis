5	This place is fabulous. Unique vintage finds and some local handmade jewelry to boot. Some prices are a little high, but it's well worth the trip. You WILL find something. I go every time my husband and I come back from CA to visit his family.
3	Nice store to find something unique! Check out the mid-season sales!
4	Hit or miss place; you'll either find something you really like and at a good price or not,depending on the stock. The items that are in execellent condition will be a bit on the pricey side,the new local designer stuff,definitely priced on the higher side and, cut for the model-sized. Some locally made trinkets, cards,and keep your eyes out for the adorable kitties wandering around the store.
