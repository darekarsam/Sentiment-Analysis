4	So much fun!!!!
5	Wonderful vendors in our very own Lawrenceville neighborhood.  Doesn't get better than that.  Found a few treasures.  i wish they had these more often!
5	I have never been to one of these before!!!  Such a great time.  The moment I walked in I saw a beautiful Pendleton jacket I had to have.  The music by Jay Malls was perfect browsing vintage items.  There were a ton of vendors, and really great items. I only wish I would have shown up when the doors opened!  Can't wait for the next one of these!!
