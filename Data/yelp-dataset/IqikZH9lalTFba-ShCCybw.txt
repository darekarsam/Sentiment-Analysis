5	DELICIOUS. On the price range: most entrees/meals are under $10, however the chicken and steak are a couple of bucks more, understandably. Not much else to say, except from the first bite I was so happy. I got the fava bean dinner and my counterpart the steak dinner. Both were amazing. He added some of the sauce from my beans to his rice, but other than that, perfect. The steak was seasoned, and was very good. Both dishes came with a side salad, which was great because I swapped out bites of my meal with bites of the salad to 'cleanse the palate' and then each bite of fava was equally yummy.I was too full for dessert, but plan to go back many, many times!
