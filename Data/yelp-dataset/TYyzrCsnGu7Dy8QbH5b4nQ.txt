4	Dom's has been around for years. The food hasn't changed, the decor screams Italian patio dining and the staff is family. Not in the Olive Garden kinda way. Yah, ya gotta love it. Stick with any of the meaty pasta dishes. Dom's is FAR superior to many of the other Italian restaurants in town. Word.*Update* - Dom's closed their doors tonight after many years of service to C-U. Too bad you missed it.
5	Dom's has closed? Noooo! Aaaagh! You're killing me!Does anyone have their recipes? Oh, please. Specifically, I'll demean myself for the recipes for two of Dom's classic dishes in particular: braciole and galena. I've seen similar recipes from other restaurants but they were never even close.Please excuse me now while I gnash my teeth and rend sackcloth.
4	An old-school place that has now closed.  But don't fret too hard, it is rumored to be relocating in downtown Champaign at some point - where everything else is!
5	Dom's has closed, it is true, but the word on the street is the family will be opening a new restaurant, called Butitta's (Dom's last name) at the location of the old now-closed Jillian's on Neil sometime in early 2009 (at least that's what the phonebook ad said). They said they'd still have some old familiar items on the menu but would have new stuff too. So keep an eye out for Butitta's!UPDATE 11/20/2009: They have a banner outside the building announcing they are now hiring servers and will be opening soon! WOO!
