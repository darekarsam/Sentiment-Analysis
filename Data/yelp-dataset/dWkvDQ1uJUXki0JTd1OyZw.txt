4	We split an order of the jalea. For those who don't speak spanish, "jalea" roughly translates to "Awesome fried seafood orgy of sexy times".A mound of fried squid, shrimp, fish, served with fried yucca fries and topped with salsa criolla (a salad of pickled onions, tomatoes and chili). The batter was light and airy but plentiful around each nugget of seafood. Dipped in a little aji verde, the spicy sauce cuts through the batter while lending a creamy texture to each bite.
2	Food is good ,, but service is not ,, there is not hot water to wash ur hands ,, I'm very disappointed !!
