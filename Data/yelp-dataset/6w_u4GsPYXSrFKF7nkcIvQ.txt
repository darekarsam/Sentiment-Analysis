1	This location is brand new in Downtown Summerlin next to Dillard's. I went in last night because it had been awhile since Id gotten my eyebrows and lip threaded, the lady was quick and it didn't hurt too much more than I'd been used to from other salons doing my brows or lip. Since my skin turns really red when I get threading done it's very difficult to see if they miss spots while I am still in the salon. However she didn't put anything on my skin to soothe the irritation like most salons do, thinking nothing of it I went home and put a little facial toner on my skin only to find my eyelids were burning. I looked in the mirror to see why and saw tiny cuts in my skin. Never in the three years I've been getting my eyebrows threaded have I had someone cut the skin on my eyelids while threading my eyebrows. Not to mention she left one eyebrow much thicker than the other.
