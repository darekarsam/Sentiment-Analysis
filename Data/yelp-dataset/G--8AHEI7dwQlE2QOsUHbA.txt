3	Alright it's just a Pharmaprix like any other, but it's a big one, and it's one of the few options for pharmacy-type stuff in the neighborhood so I guess I was bound to review it eventually. It's a nice big pharmacy with spacious aisles and big sections devoted to cosmetics, kids, holidays, food, vitamins. There is a Canada Post office in the back and a photo center with some odd sales on iPod docks and Xbox games. The weekly sales make up for the slight over-pricing. Generally things like cream, coffee, cans of soups, toilet paper can be found at 50% once per week.But the real issue here is the building. The Pharmaprix is like a white modern building inserted into a gorgeous heritage building. You can't tell it's there from the inside, there is no way to explore or connect with the historical architecture, but you can see it looming above and behind from the outside and while that's better than losing the old artistry entirely it certainly doesn't count as preservation if you ask me. But I may just be bitter because I want inside that amazing old space!!
4	I love Pharmaprix! I love the stuff they have (from the store brand to the super expensive brands), the cosmeticians (for the most part) really know their stuff, they always have what I need AND I get extra points when there's specials.. I see NOTHING wrong with this place!
