4	I'm sure I'm known here as "The Girl Who Brings in 600 Blue Men's Shirts for Cleaning." Hey, the hubs likes the hue and I'm sure Citi appreciates the business--as do I appreciate the convenience and service.Citi is tucked in the Ally building and is an easy stop for South Church-side Uptowners' organic dry cleaning and C-store needs. They have my threads ready within 48 hours, and I have no complaints; in fact, I praise their ability to have rescued a wool coat that had an unfortunate run-in with a blob of melted chocolate.This location also offers a nice selection of snacks, beer and wine. The latter may be a tad marked up, but when I've needed libations in a pinch I am content to pay for the convenience. (And pay with paper, Visa or MC--no Amex as of yet.)
1	I had such a HORRIBLE experience, that I decided to write a Yelp Review, which I have never done. I took a bridesmaid dress to get hemmed. I picked it up, packed it away in the protective plastic it came in. To my dismay, when I pulled it out on the wedding day the dress was completely ruined. Stains all over it, the top completely discolored. Absolutely unwearable. Not only did they ruin my dress - but when I took it in, they denied doing it and would not offer anything in return. So now I am out over a hundred dollars for the dress, and 28 dollars I paid for her to hem it. I will NEVER use this store again, especially because they won't hold themselves accountable for something they royally messed up. I suggest you find another dry-cleaners.
