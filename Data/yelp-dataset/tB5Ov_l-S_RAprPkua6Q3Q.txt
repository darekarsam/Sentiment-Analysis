5	The only downfall is hours; 10-8 mon- fri,10-7 sat and 12-4 on sun
4	Cheaper then KFC and tastes better in my book.
4	Well I actually went to the burger king right next door but the popeyes is a great place also. Borne places have great customer service. If you want something cheap not a bad place to go, but I recommend going after the lunch rush or you might be waiting for a bit.
3	It is popeyes and burger king combined it was my last meal before I started my weight loss for the year. Thanks for a good last meal.
4	What more can you say?  One thing I wish they had here that they do overseas is breakfast.  The Popeye's on bases overseas to a spicy chicken breast fillet with egg and cheese on a biscuit.
1	Avoid at all costs. I'm a disabled veteran and have stopped here a few times after shopping at the commissary. 2 outta 3 times I felt like my insides were clawing their way out a few hours after eating their food. Someone is either dirty handling the food during the day, or not preparing it properly. Either way, I will not be returning again. Yikes...
1	Just got served RAW chicken tenders. Thank god I broke one in two pieces and looked at them. Avoid. This should never happen at a place that does crispy chicken all day, everyday...
