5	My wife and I just relocated to Glendale from Los Angeles, and were referred to Evo Vapor by my sister. This place is awesome, and the customer service is impeccable. They have a wide variety of oils and vapor set ups at a very reasonable price, and even have a reward points system. By far the best vapor shop we have ever been in. No doubt this will be the only vapor shop we go to from now on. You guys rock at Evo Vapor, and we appreciate your great product and service!!!
5	Great shop ,great prices and excellent customer service..
5	I highly recommend this shop to everyone, bar none best around!! and most informational workers, friendly and helpful , they have a full line of quality products and everything you may need! I quit smoking a few months ago and without the information and help from these guys I don't think I could have, I bought a basic kit to start, best part was on top of all the help, they only showed me what I might want to start with. I'm referring these guys to everyone!!Great prices and best products !!!
5	Great shop! The drip/juice bar is open to the public. You can actually go behind the bar and drip any juice you'd like. Vary welcoming staff and atmosphere. I was told they make their own juice too which is pretty cool. I didn't feel obligated to buy anything, they were more interested in showing me around and introducting them self. I was even offered some Howie  bread they ordered. I'll be back forsure!
