5	The evening of my filling I received a call personally from Dr. Yu just to check that everything was ok.  Now THAT is customer service!  Everyone at Dr. Yu's office is fantastic.  I've had several dentists in the past and Dr. Yu is the best by far.  Dentistry really is an art... you can settle for some 'other guy' because he's close to your office or really cheap but you're only doing yourself a disservice.  Stop wasting time reading reviews and just book your appointment with Dr. Yu; you'll be glad you did.
5	Dr. Yu and his team are pretty great! I bought a groupon for a cleaning along with x-rays and got an appointment about a month from when I called in. Upon my appointment, what I received was prompt and timely care from each employee. The dental hygienist was very kind and talkative throughout the cleaning, without being intrusive. Dr. Yu headed in to talk with me about my X-rays and stayed for probably ten minutes talking with me about my chompers - giving sound advice about upping my habits, fancy that- once a week flossing just doesn't cut it! Anyways, if you are looking for a kind and efficient dental office- you will enjoy your experience here!
5	I first discovered Dental Center of Charlotte from a Groupon I bought. $60 for x-rays & cleaning. Not bad!!The girls at the reception desk are dolls! Super sweet & helpful.Dr. David Yu is wonderful! He is extremely knowledgeable, efficient & witty! He made me feel very comfortable during my entire dental procedure! :-)
