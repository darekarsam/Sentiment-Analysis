4	This place is clean and well staffed, but what makes it stand apart is the fact that their carwash is great.  They cut me a good deal on detailing my truck and let me substitute the free carwash I was owed with my second car.  Great service.
1	This place had a melt down this morning and all the gas pumps shut off. The staff was inexperienced at how to handle large volumes of customers let alone customer service. I waited patiently for 15 min then walked back in to get my refund only to have the manager "mike " be rude , unprofessional and can't count. Will not return and rather push my car to the next gas station .
3	Nice and clean. Actually stopped for the car wash and just hung out inside while the car was getting cleaned. Nice and spacious inside. TV's and even video games to play.
3	Originally I was going to go with a 1 star because of my experience here, but after speaking with the Manager the following day, I have decided to go with 3 stars.  The manager Javier was VERY nice, apologetic and even asked me if there was anything he could possibly do to make me any happier......Who does that anymore?... THIS PLACE.
4	Gets crowded but friendly in and out service. Near my office so you get thr crowd with the 8 to 5 crowd, but no problems. Clean and orderly.
