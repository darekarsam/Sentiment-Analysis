2	I never thought a minimalist ethos would apply to a shoe shop, and Camper has confirmed that preconception. Unlike the fancy sales arrangements from the likes of Office, Camper seems content to just slap a load of shoes onto one big table and expect the consumer to rummage through their offerings. Seemingly, this is a good idea when they open up shop at 9am, but by the mid afternoon the neatly placed footwear becomes jumbled and disorderly as wave after wave of curious customer picks them up and tosses them down.  I'd be willing to put up with this if the shoes on sale where any good, but a whimsical assortment of rubber soled loafers and altogether naff styles just doesn't tempt me.
