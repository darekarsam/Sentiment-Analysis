4	Korea House (or Maison Koreene) is a Korean BBQ (KBBQ) on Queen Mary. It wasn't busy that evening, but a few folks trickled in as dinner progressed. Their interior is homey, just like their food.We had various plates, including: dolsot bibimap (C$9.95), jap chae (C$12.95), bulgogi jeongshik (C$12.95), and galbi jeongshik (grilled marinated beef ribs; C$14.95). The meats were tender, and the marinades a classic flavor. Plates of banchan included slightly fermented kimchi, pickled cucumbers, and bean sprouts. We shared some tasty twigim mandoo (fried dumplings; C$6.95), and the soondubu ($8.95) is pretty good. We washed everything down with water, tea, and of course, soju!Our rockin' server (Emily) got us everything we needed.While Korea House isn't the BEST KBBQ I've ever had, it was comforting, and provided a good value. Check them out!
3	Went there once.  It's now closed or they relocated.  Not sure.  Too bad!
1	This place has long been closed. Putting one star so it'll fall lower in searches. I personally used to go to this place quite often.
