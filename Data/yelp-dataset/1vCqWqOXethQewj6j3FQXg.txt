5	I have used Sun City Auto for several years now. They are honest, caring and friendly. I have never been disappointed in their service. Even the waiting area shows a lot of thought. Comfortable furniture, big screen TV, current reading material, Keurig coffee maker along with snacks. Don't mind waiting a bit! However, a ride home is in the offing if you so choose. I cannot say enough about this company. Even my son, who has his own mechanic business in Southern California, says "Stick with them Mom".
4	Great Mechanic, I recommend taking your vehicle here for service.
5	Finally, an honest place to take your car.  Don't bother looking anywhere else.  The owner takes the time to review everything with you and explains everything in detail.  The place is great. Thank you.
5	I took my 2013 Chevy Tahoe here because Sands Chevrolet in Surprise told me I needed $600+ worth of maintenance. Over the phone Sun City Auto Service said it would be about half that price, but they also said according to the owners manual I shouldn't need any of that work done. I brought it in today and they checked everything and found that I really didn't need any of that work done. They didn't charge me for checking anything. When my vehicle does need the maintenance done, I will be returning to Sun City Auto Service.
5	Took my '95 Cady ETS in for the A/C to be recharged.  Casey and the team did a thorough inspection and helped me get the car running great!  Over the weekend we noticed a wire hanging and took it back and Casey reattached a bracket that had come loose - all fixed, no charge!Great service!
