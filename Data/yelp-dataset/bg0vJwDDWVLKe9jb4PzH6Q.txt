5	This is the BEST dentist in Las Vegas. Clean, professional, very friendly, very welcoming- they all make you feel so comfortable and at ease. The dentist is not normally anywhere you want to be but this makes you look forward to your next visit! Thanks for making my smile even brighter! :)
5	I went to this dentist because they came highly recommend and I wanted to get Invisalign. My teeth were very crooked and I wasn't sure if I would be eligible for Invisalign. Dr. Baalbacky worked hard to get me approved as I really didn't want to get braces. During the entire process everyone here was very professional and super helpful! I now have awesome straight teeth and a beautiful smile. I can't thank you guys enough for everything!! I would recommend this office for all your dental needs!
5	this is the best dentist office i have ever been to! they got me in as a new patient a couple hours after i called. i couldn't get in to my then current dentist that quick! Stacie is awesome, very friendly and actually cares about what is going on with you. this office will do what ever they can and need to to make sure you are taken care of correctly. i had a few issues my old dentist got crown happy on and wanted to go all out on it just for the buck. they flat out told me at elite that was way over extreme. every one hates the dentist office but after all these years i found one i actually dont mind making an appointment with. (and i always hated the dentist office!) all my family is jumping ship and coming over here after my experience here. i cant tell you how nice it is to go in for an appointment and not have to fight to get what you want done. im not one to have different issues fixed at one time.( you feel like you took a beating with a frying pan for the rest of the week) and they where more than fine with taking my issues in stride and knocking them out one at a time. in a strange way im glad my old dentist jacked up a tooth. ending up here was a great experience.
