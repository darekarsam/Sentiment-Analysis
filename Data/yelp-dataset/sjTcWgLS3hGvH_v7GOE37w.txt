3	We were in town for a wedding, met by busloads of soccer players and parents who came for a weekend tournament. Still, the hallways at night were relatively quiet (I guess the kids were tired out). Our third-floor king suite was very clean, comfortable, and cool. Check-in was easy, and check-out at nearly noon was no problem. We simply hung the "quiet please" card on the door, and housekeeping never bothered us, even after stepping out for brunch. There's plenty of parking here, with easy access to I-74 via Lincoln Ave.
4	I've stayed at hundreds of hotels over the years, and each brand kind of gets a reputation for me.  As Holiday Inn Express is rated in my experience, this is one of the better ones.  This was my third of fourth stay at this property, and it has always been very clean.  It seems the rooms are a little larger that average.  It is also very quiet, which usually is the result of occupancy load and day of the week so I'm not sure that is something to count on.  Decent experiences at this property.
