5	Brand new, right at the end of Murray. Long hours and great selection. There are a couple of other locations- one in Oakland and one on Ellsworth- but this one is the biggest. Still getting their legs under them, I think, but we're big fans!
4	Aside from my claim that Pennsylvania has probably the worst liquor laws in the country and that the six packs you get here are $5 more expensive than you can get them anywhere else, It's Dogg'n It is pretty cool. The name of the this place is awesome. They skirt the stupid state laws by selling hot dogs. They offer a variety of beer. I'm sorry if you live in this state and you drink. It's Dogg'n It is one of your few salvations.

4	So if you want a wide selection of beers this is the place. Despite the awesome selection, this place is a bit overpriced. But one thing I like about it is that they have a discount area for beers that are out of season.  For example I paid $6 for a pecan porter that was out of season. So theres that. The staff was nice and seemed knowledgeable about beers more so than the Ellsworth location. Either way if I missed an out of season beer, this may be the place to hit up.
