3	They have my money and give me almost nothing in return (other than a very good online banking system)... can I really give them anything but 3 stars?
1	terrible customer service.. long wait times.. disrespectful and lazy attitude from tellers.. just closed my personal account there and working on getting a commercial account there closed as well... very rude to people doing commercial transactions..
5	Always full when I walk in but they are working fast to service people.
