2	I don't know why Fry's Food & Drug bothers to stay open past 10PM as they are so limited on what they can do for you after that time.  We went in to buy some laundry detergent and get a roll of quarters ( Have to wash clothes at hotel ) and acourse they didn't have any.  I guess its not that big of deal but its just frustrating especially since Winco has entered the market and is far superior even against Wal-Mart.Fry's is lucky they are basically on every corner because once Winco builds out across the valley Fry's will be hurting.
4	Bank of America located inside. Rose, the deli manager, is fantastic and all about customer service.
5	I love everyone here and the store is very easy to get around and I never have a problem finding help for anything. keep up the great work people!
