3	this is a chain of australian- themed bars. my review is based only on the bar aspect of the place; i did not eat here although the menu featured such idiosyncratic delicacies like kangaroo salad. being a chain, it's a bit short of atmosphere. but there were myriad sports options on the many TV screens and several offerings of australian beer (but none of my favorites like cascade, boags or even xxxx). if you're a homesick aussie or sports fanatic, this place is a-ok.
4	Walkabout is a great and friendly bar which is part of the Omni Centre entertainment complex.  I've visited this bar a few times now, primarily to watch Six Nations or Rugby World Cup games, and this bar provided a great atmosphere to that.Obviously, on days of big sporting occasions, you do need to be early to guarantee a seat, as it does tend to get busy quite quickly.  The prices are slightly higher than standard pub prices, but they do a tasty range of food that will be enough to keep you going through a tense second half.I've yet to go to this place for a normal night out, but I can't fault it on the sports atmosphere.  I too would be intrigued to try the kangaroo burger - I'm sure the standard 'tastes like chicken' will be the response!
3	Have you ever tried a kangaroo burger?No?Then you must pay Walkabout a visit. I had never tasted a kangaroo burger before I stepped into this Australian themed bar, but when I left this bar I had thoroughly enjoyed the experience of the kangaroo burger!Apart from the kangaroo burger, the bar offers a selection of Aussie themed foods and a good selection of drinks at the bar. However, one aspect that disappointed me was the atmosphere. I have only ever been early evening and the place lacked the atmosphere that is common in other bars and pubs. The bar itself is quite large and seemed to me to be quite empty, the premises just seem to big for this bar at times.However, if you want the full Australian experience in Edinburgh, Walkabout is not a bad choice!
