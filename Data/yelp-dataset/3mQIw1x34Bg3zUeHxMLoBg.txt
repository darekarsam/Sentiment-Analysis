3	This location is just okay.  It definitely felt like an older store with floors that were in need of a deep cleaning - I knelt down to look at some of the paper on the bottom shelves and when I got back up my leg was dirty (like black dirty).  They have most of the regular offerings for this chain and we were able to find some of the matching paper we needed that another store was out of.  We head to various craft stores pretty often.  I have a small shop on Etsy and I like to make things regularly for my store, gifts for friends or just for us to have around the house!  Overall: BThe staff was friendly and the store was pretty well organized, but due to its distance and the smaller size of the location compared to other stores in the area for this same chain, we will most likely only go if if there is a need or we happen to be in the area.
4	I love sunday coupons. Great way to get a good price on frames
5	I'm currently a DIY bride planning my wedding and this is the closest Michaels to my house. I've been to other Michaels in the valley and they just don't compare to this one! Every time I come here (which is a lot) it is always very easy to find what I need. They also have the nicest staff out of all of the Michaels I have been too. They go above and beyond to please their customers.I also love that each time I make a purchase I get a new 40% off coupon for the next week!
