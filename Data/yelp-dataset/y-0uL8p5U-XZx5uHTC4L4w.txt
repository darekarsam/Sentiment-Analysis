4	A whole bunch of unique, local vendors + beer + music + gourmet donut truck = the perfect way to Christmas shop.One of my favorite parts about this event was the fact that I hadn't heard of probably 90% of the businesses that took part. From jewelry to soaps, cheese and pasta sauces... I discovered dozens of brand new local brands.My other discovery: the Sugar Handmade Gourmet Donut food truck. I didn't realize how much I needed a maple bacon donut until I watched someone else walk by with one. I look forward to watching this event grow each year. Support local, shop local!
5	What neat event! Lots of unique, local vendors that we had no idea existed!
5	I really enjoyed Shop Micro Local, and I'll definitely attend next year. There were a lot of great shops, and I was definitely not at a loss for things to buy. I was especially pleased to meet some folks from Winchester, Kentucky who were selling beer cheese. Sucks to your pimento cheese. Beer cheese is where it's at.One of my favorite things about this event was the free trolley. I was able to enjoy a few beverages at Triple C without having to worry about driving, parking, or anything else. Nice touch!
