5	_ Randy Abdin is one of the best Real Estate Specialist that I had the honor to work with, and I had gone through alot of other agents that were just a waste of time, pushing me to see homes that were nowhere close to the description of what I had described initially!!     Randy Abdin had the patience, professionalism and drive to help and successfully find my new home!!!!! *Time after time, I would tell him what I wanted and I was super picky, as a First Time Home Buyer, as well as a single home buyer. He was of great help during they entire home buying process/experience, and believe me it was a bit stressful at times, with the gathering of paper work, making time for the home showings, making offers to preferred homes, looking at short-sales, the whole thing. I had this experience a while, while back in about February of 2010 was the start of it and I thankfully had the luck of closing on a home that I really liked, this was in May 21, 2010 and I am proud to say still gladly satisfied with. The process was smooth, easy, as well organized.     * * * Randy always went above and beyond with what I needed, helping me find the perfect Broker and best deal!!I am eternally thankful and so is my family, since he had also helped my family on our previous home purchase years before!!        I had no other way of showing all my gratitude than providing him a basket full of cookies for all his dedicated hard work, he is a truly great person and Real Estate Specialist and I would recommend him in a heart beat.                                                               *** Best of Luck!!!!!!
5	My husband and I worked with Danielle Zampino to buy an investment property in our IRA. (I recommend this - it's a great way to build your retirement account) It was a tricky purchase because it was a HUD-owned foreclosure and initially, our bid was accepted but ultimately turned down by  HUD's part because the feds have rules for IRAs that HUD was unprepared for. Danielle worked with us to resubmit the bid as they advised, but HUD rejected it on the second go-round! Danielle held up great under the pressure and we were finally rewarded when the HUD buyer fell through. Finally, we were able to close the cash deal and it took a total of three months. This wasn't a huge commission for Danielle, but she worked just as hard as if it were. Great professionalism and personal service!
5	We found our home with the help of Dave Pries with the Aladin Group and I would highly recommend his services! He was very prompt, knowledgeable and took the time with us as first time home buyers. Dave made the experience enjoyable :)
5	Angela was referred to us by my son and we are eternally grateful.  Do not be deceived by her sweet, unassuming, agreeable, affable demeanor, this lady has some teeth.  This is who you want on your side.    The first day Angela met us at her office and went over some homes on the computer with us then took us out and showed us pre-owned homes we thought we'd like; a large workshop was our main priority.  During that search we realized we needed a 4 car garage because homes that had proper workshops were not available.  That afternoon Angela got on the phone to builders asking who built homes with 4 car garages in our price range.  That following day she found us a brand new spec home that perfectly met our wants/needs.    Now here's where the teeth came in.  She campaigned for and got us a $5,500. discount and wrung every last concession from the builder possible. If the salesman mentioned a perk for other models or lenders she was right there asking in our favor.  The $5,500. Discount was if we used the builder's lender but we were paying cash.  She made sure we got the discount.  Altogether we moved in with about $57,000.00 equity.  No I did not misplace the decimal point.  She did the same thing for my son  Angela does not waste time.  From start to finish it took four days.  We closed and moved about two weeks later.  Angela is an energetic and knowlegeable advocate.  As a former Realtor I am impressed with her unflagging attention to detail. I would highly recommend her anyone. You can't get a better one anywhere.
