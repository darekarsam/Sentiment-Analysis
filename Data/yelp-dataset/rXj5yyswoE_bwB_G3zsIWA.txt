2	Un peu cher pour un repas du midi. Les classiques sont absent. L'ambiance est intime.
4	This place is a restaurant by day and a cooking school by night. I tried the butter chicken, an old classic, with naan and a lentil soup. Everything was well prepared and the naan was very fresh. I wish the soup was a bit bigger though. Decor and music were quite nice and homey... something that is often lacking in other indian places. Surprisingly for an indian restaurant the waitress was Dutch (!). She was really friendly and attentive so good marks for service.
4	Fine exemple of home style cooking in a fine and cosy ambiance... There is a rare authenticity in the way dishes are prepared, not unlike those I have been served while I was received as a guest in India.Simple Food, amazing satisfaction for the palate. It is not the pretention but the reality of spices that makes the difference here.
4	Really good home cooking. Took the cooking class and really enjoyed it. The hours seem a little funny sometimes but worth going for it!
