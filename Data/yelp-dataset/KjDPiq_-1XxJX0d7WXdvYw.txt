5	I have been using this facility for years for both of my cars and have always been treated fairly and quickly. They also have a shuttle service which is very helpful!  Today I found a big nasty nail in one of my tires and took the car in. They repaired it quickly as I did not have an appointment.. no charge.  Really!  What a nice bunch of people that work there, I will "pay it forward"!  Thank you
1	This is the second time one of the AAA car care centers has done something to confirm why I will never use them again. My wife and I took her car in so they can charge the battery since it had a weak charge. We dropped it off and came back 4 hours later. This guy looked us in the face and said that the battery was basically dead and would not take a charge. He said he doubted that it had enough of a charge to crank. He explained that he hooked it up and could not get the battery to hold a charge. He, of course, suggested a battery from AAA. I know it was a lie because we had the battery tested twice and the second time was the day before we took it in. I  looked at him like he was crazy because he was. I told him that we would take our chances on it and that we were not buying a new battery. I took the keys and we walked out. We crunk the car up and drove off. Truly crazy.
5	I had a amazing experience at AAA car care. The customer service that was givin to me was above and behind. Mind blowing is how I would describe my visit.  I went in for a simple tire repair, and was greeted with warm "hello how can we help you?"   the workers there have a real positive attitude. They took great care of my car.... But what made my visit great were.... The good workers, smiling faces, the great coffee, clean sitting area, and great management.... I just want to say thank you so much for the great service.... I will recommend this place to everyone I know. And I will be back.
