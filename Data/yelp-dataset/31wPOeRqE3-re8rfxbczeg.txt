5	Great Dentist, been going there for 6 years with the entire family and have had no regrets, the staff is awesome, place is beautiful and they work very hard to make going to the dentist as pleasant as it can be.Great flexibility with insurance and money management.  Dr Nitu genuilly cares about your teeth and is not there to get rich, a great professional who cares about his patients.
5	My father- in - law asked me to share his wonderful experience at this office. He loved the comfortable chairs and the staff were amazing. But most amazing was the fact that his treatment was painless. The Dr. was so very gentle.
5	Been going to Dr Nitu for 13 years.  Tried some other dentists closer to home but Dr N is worth travelling for.  Gentle, informative, competitive fees and, main thing, excellent treatment by him and his staff.
5	Dr. Nitu is a great dentist. We have been going to him for over 10 years. The whole staff is outstanding. Vicki is absolutely the best!
5	Staff is very helpful and pleasant to work with, they take great pride in their office and the comfort of their customer.  Dr. Nitu has his art work hanging throughout...very friendly man.  Thank you!  We will be back.
