2	Good food, staff is kinda rude and unhelpful.
2	Pizza is bland and too pricey considering you have bake it yourself. Much better choices nearby.
3	We order out from Papa Murphy's a few times every year, and the staff are pleasant enough. The food is fine, though I agree it's an unusual business model: the pizza costs more than a premium frozen pizza and you do have to bake it. That said, I find it's much less expensive than other local pizza joints like Glass Nickel which (while tasty!) are considerably more expensive. On the balance, this Papa Murphy's strikes a balance of value and convenience that occasionally wins the day for our family.
