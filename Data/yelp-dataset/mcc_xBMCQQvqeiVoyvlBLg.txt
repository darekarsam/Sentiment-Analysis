5	I had a problem with a purchase. Nick went above and beyond to fix the problem. This is an exceptional company with exceptional products. I highly recommend Yahara Bay Distillers.
5	My husband and I were in Madison for an overnight anniversary get away.  We were looking into doing something different and Yahara Bay came up with tours and tasting.  We've been to brewery's and wineries and wanted to try something different...and it sure was!We were greeted by their friendly staff, given a tour of their "old school" distillery....everyone was so friendly and informative in telling us how the process works, how they chose to open this unique adventure and about the different things we tasted.If you love whiskey, gin, liquors.....they have some of the most unique and tasty things being made, bottled and sold.....FUN FUN afternoon....check them out!!!
5	They've switched over to online scheduling of tours and I didn't realize, so we showed up at the location on a Monday morning as they opened and they totally accommodated us, which we totally appreciated. We were lucky enough to get the local sales rep and she just walked us around, giving great insight and detail. We sampled a bunch of the spirits and she even mixed us a couple of cocktails. She let us know about events coming up in the Milwaukee area, where we could find the spirits here and made she we only bought the things we couldn't get here. It was a great little detour off the "beer" part of beercation and I'm glad we added it in. They had a gorgeous still sitting right in the middle of the room and you can get all up close on it, looking around and learning all kinds of interesting bits about it. I loved the closeness of the whole thing and being able to really get up close and personal. Highly recommend - just, you know, sign up online so they know you're coming!
