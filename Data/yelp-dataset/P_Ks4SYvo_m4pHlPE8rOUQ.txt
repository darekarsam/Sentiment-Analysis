4	I live about 5 minutes from Belmont, thus I do most of my shopping there as opposed to heading into the city itself (and lets face it, going down Wilkinson toward uptown isn't exactly the best place to shop!).  I mix up my groceries between Harris Teeter, Walmart, and Bi-Lo.  This Bi-Lo in particular usually has a lot of helpful folks, it's very conveniently located and is open all the time.  I prefer the deli here over Walmart lets say and you can usually get a lot of items on sale that are cheaper than Walmart as well - but not a lot of the stuff that isn't on sale.  If you are looking for a grocery store in and around Belmont, this is probably the best place to go.
3	Convenience is always important
3	This ratings is more for the employee's they have bagging the groceries at this location. I love the deals this Bi-Lo has to offer. That's why I shop here. I spend a lot of time planning my grocery trips, clipping coupons and checking out the circular. When I get to the store I spend the same amount of time picking out my groceries. When I get to the check-out the last thing I want to happen to my carefully picked groceries is to have them thrown into bags, crushed, bruised, and meat packaging punctured due to poor bagging. When I left the store today my tomatoes were at the bottom of a bag with boxed goods packed on top of them, same with my hamburger meat. My bread was crammed into a bag along with canned goods and all other canned goods/jars of food were packed in single plastic bags, filled to the max. Needless to say, carrying my groceries into my home was a bit of a gamble, as two of my bags handles ripped, and another that was crammed full of boxed groceries ripped down the side. As much as I love the deals and the convenience of this location, I don't think I will continue shopping here if the service doesn't improve. I would rather pay a little more for my groceries than have things ruined and damaged due to poor workmanship.
