2	My boyfriend and I decided to come here after passing it hundreds of times and after learning that it's been around for sixty years it must be good right? Wrong. The people were nice enough, however the food was not anything to write home about. I suggest going to the new Chinese resturant on Brownsville road instead. I do give them props for the cost. Our meal was very cheap, but that's not good enough for me.
2	I've grown up in the South Hills of Pittsburgh and Lotus Garden has been around long before I was born.  Due to it's long running history, I decided to give this Chinese restaurant a try.  Unfortunately I was not impressed.Lotus Garden's menu is what you would expect from a typical Chinese restaurant: egg rolls, won ton soup, lo mein, and rice dishes accompanied with various meats.  I decided to go with a dish I've had many times in the past, so I ordered Kung Pao Chicken with an egg roll and won ton soup.  The won ton soup was excellent, and the egg roll had a unique crispy texture (although lacking in flavor).  However, the brown sauce for the Kung Pao wasn't very good at all, and I had hard time getting through 1/3 of the meal.  Ditto with my girlfriend's Orange Chicken.  Not to mention, they give a very small glass of water and aren't consistent with refills.Overall, the only thing I really enjoyed about my meal and my girlfriend's was the won ton soup.  The staff was very nice at least, but with the vast number of choices you have for Chinese food, you should consider looking elsewhere.
