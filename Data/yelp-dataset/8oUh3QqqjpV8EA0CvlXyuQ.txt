3	Game nights mean $10 for 2 lbs of wings if you buy a 2L pitcher ($16) which is a decent deal. My problem was that the service is crap. Had to flag down the staff even though it's not a busy place. Pretty simple concept to visit the table when new people show up. Also put all our dishes at one point of the table (5 plates + pitchers) and it still took well over 20 mins before they were taken away. A table of 15-20 and you visit 3 times other than bringing the food? Unacceptable. Bad service but ok for food and prices. Bowling is overpriced, pool tables are in good condition.
3	Visit this place only if you are here for bowling. There are better sports bars around the city with much better food and service. The food here is cheap and they have $10 wings on hockey nights (If you order a pitcher of beer). Service is painfully slow. On a positive note, this place is HUGE. So next time you wanna watch a game (Hockey / UFC / etc) and all other sports bars are full,  Forum sports Bar is the place to go Food : OkService :You gotta be kiddin meAmbiance : CasualWorth the price : Yes
3	This is definitely a place to kill some time before a movie at the Cineplex Odeon. It's pretty middle of the row. I would probably add a point for better beer to be honest. But all in all, I'd recommend purely for the nostalgia and fun of ski ball and air hockey.
4	Great place to go with the better half of friends... Decent beer selection lots of games and such
