5	I love the employees at this place. The store is a little small and they get extremely busy. Make an appointment for first thing in the morning in the middle of the week if your work schedule allows it.
5	No one will ever hold a candle to Discount Tire in my book.  My family have been loyal customers for over 20 years and will NEVER go anywhere else.  Good, honest, quick service.  Clean waiting room, nice technicians, lots of choices and no pushing to buy the most expensive tires.  I wish all businesses ran like this one.  And it is a local AZ company.
5	Discount Tire will always be one of my favorite places to bring my business. Every single time I go in they are fast, friendly and professional. I always take advantage of the free tire pressure check and even in rain, heat or winter cold they always do the best job for me. I will buy my tires and rims from these guys every time. Today I took my vehicle in for a tire rotation with no appointment and they had me in and out within 15 minutes. The best part was they didn't even charge me for the rotation and I hadn't bought my tires from them yet for my newest vehicle. I did know someone there so wasn't sure if they do that for everyone. I would have paid for it though and I offered. Free is great but I hate being a cheapskate too so it was much appreciated. You can bet I'll be back to buy tires from them when I'm due.
