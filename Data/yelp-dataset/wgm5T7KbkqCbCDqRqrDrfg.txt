4	This is the best saloon in the vicinity where I live. I usually ask for kelli for my haircuts but they are all nice otherwise! One more point to note is that, if you sign up for their monthly reminders, you get discount coupons like 2$ for a haircut. Its not much but a discount is a discount!
2	I get my hair cut at these types of places and i rotate all the time. There is a guy here - mildly creepy and blatently prompting you for gossip. I'm sure he and so many other stylists get a ton of it but i could tell he was prompting me for it. No thanks. When i want to put people on blast i'll do it myself.
