5	I recently moved from Scottsdale to N Phoenix and needed to find a more convenient barber. Stopped in today and was greated by Emanuel. He promptly seated me into his barber chair and asked if I had been in before. I told him my story and he went to work. 15 minutes later I had a good haircut and will come back. The shop is very clean and there was no wait unlike 2 other shops over at Norterra which are usually very busy and take a while if you are a walk in. This is a good shop and I recommend it!
5	Did a great job. I have a barber down in old town Scottsdale and have been going to him for years. Now that I moved I had to get someone closer. Being very particular about my hair I was worried; however at the end they did a great job and well priced!!!! Coming back for more cuts!!
