5	Ask for Rosa! Very well trained and entire barbershop is extremely clean at all times. Price per haircut is $13 which is a deal! She speaks Spanish also and does single razor shaves. Must try!
5	From fades, tapers, and businessman haircuts, Rosa knows how to do them all, and do them VERY well. She has been my barber for just about a year now, and I can honestly say that I have never left her shop without thinking "this is a great looking haircut!" You can text Rosa and set up an appointment on YOUR time and be assured  that you won't be treated like just another customer at great clips. She is great with kids, very friendly and welcoming.
5	Rosa and Jeannette came highly recommended to me by my co-workers. Got a beautiful haircut and style for an amazing price! I was surprised and happy to learn they have services beyond cuts for women, as well as standard barber services for men. Their warmth and friendliness make this a shop I will visit regularly, with every member of my family! Thank you for such a wonderful experience!
