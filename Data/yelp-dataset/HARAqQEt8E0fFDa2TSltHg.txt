1	If I could give it zero stars I would. I am not going waste any more of my time with this establishment. They just suck.
4	We appreciated having the SDX as an alternative to the Deuce, for getting to our destination much quicker. Often times we needed to get from one end of the strip to the other, or from one end to the midpoint. The SDX allows this much quicker than the Deuce (which stops at practically every hotel).Wynn to Bellagio, Bellagio to Excalibur, and back again. It also lets you get downtown and back, fairly quick.
