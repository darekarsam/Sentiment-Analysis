4	I have so far been very impressed with this office. The girls at the front desk are very nice and also interact with the patients (ie; x-rays) which I appreciate. Usually it is not fun to be passed off from person to person in a doctor's office...their skill set makes it so you are comfortable with the people you're working with and eliminates feeling as though you're in a pinball machine, bouncing from here to there!  Dr. Saunders is clearly knowledgeable in his field and has really eased any worries I had about my foot injury. He is patient and thorough in his explanations. This office also does in-house x-rays and short notice appointments which is helpful considering most people don't plan to break their toes 4-6 weeks out :) I certainly hope I don't have to frequent this office after I'm all healed up but if I do happen to sustain another foot fancy injury, I will be sure to see Dr. Saunders.
5	4 surgeries later and I'm very happy with Dr. Saunders.  I've had a heck of a time, but he has been very helpful.  Also, a straight shooter, which is refreshing.  My whole family sees him.  No mix-ups with the office staff on appt's or billing.  This is a commodity in today's environment,
1	I sent my 18 year old college student daughter here for a procedure.  The doctors and nurses were mean, and insulting.  I would not recommend this facility.  He denegrated ASU'S academic reputation and made inappropriate comments to her.
5	I had an infected ingrown toenail (gross, I know) and needed relief ASAP!! However, it was the week of Thanksgiving and most places I called didn't have openings, However this place got me in the Wed before Thanksgiving. I saw Dr. Suykerbuyk. He was very friendly, informative, and efficient. If I need a podiatrist again, I will be back! i did not have any problems with the front desk.
