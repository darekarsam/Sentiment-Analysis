1	My husband and I love Indian food and was very excited to find a place close to where we live. What a disappointment! The naan bread was actually pita bread, it looks store bought. The vegetable biryani was not fresh and steamed in an aluminum foil packet; it was not at all what we expected. We've experienced the wonderful, true, fresh Indian food and this is definitely not it.
1	Worst restaurant I have ever seen in Phoenix. Pathetic taste and so stubborn to take any inputs or suggestions from the customers.
