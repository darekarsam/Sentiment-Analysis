5	Beautiful store and great furniture at affordable prices! Jody was very helpful and sweet! Delivery was right on time. Great experience and I'll be going back for more in the future
5	I found this store in the Safari business park by driving on the 15 freeway one day.  Anyway, they have a great selection of designer furniture at bargain prices!!  I bought a leather sofa and chair that was a showroom sample and it looks fabulous in my house.  They told me they get new things all the time so it's worth checking out.
4	Large place with lots of nice unique stuff. Some of it was pricey but all nice furniture is. I was looking for a light executive type desk. The lady showed me they have another whole large area in the back with me stuff. They didn't have what I was looking for  but I will keep this place in mind for future purchases.
