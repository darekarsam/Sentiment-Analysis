3	This place is interesting.I can't say I have left here disappointed.  If you're looking for a well-appointed, modern, perfectly-decorated-to-the-nines type of place, this ain't it.  If you are looking for a place to get some good body work done, well, this is the place.I have had a couple of Swedish massages here, and they were great.  In fact, I'd say they were one of the better places in town for this.  Now, let me tell you about the energy massage.  I booked one not really knowing what it was, and it definitely was not anything like I was expecting.  You have to have an open mind, because if you don't it will feel little more like someone waving their hands in front of your face to soothe your pains.  I have to admit that I felt very relaxed after the massage, if not just as much as a standard hands-on massage, but it didn't cure all that ailed me.  One of the things I love about this place is that I can book online, and usually get same-day appointments.  Also, they have frequent Groupons and deals so you can get a good discount on a massage.So, I guess I could say this is a great place for getting a massage, and if you have an open mind, it could be even better.
5	I have tried a lot of other centers and practitioners in Madison and have foundry experiences at Healing Inspirations to be my best find.  I have been treated here multiple times in the past year and have always been very happy with the results. The staff is friendly, the tables are comfortable and there is a variety of services to help with physical and spiritual well being.
