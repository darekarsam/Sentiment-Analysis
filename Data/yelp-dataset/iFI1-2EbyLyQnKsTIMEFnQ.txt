1	The employees here are helpful, whenever you can actually catch one on the sales floor. Good selection and low prices but the quality of the products isn't the best. Other stores in the area have started permanently matching and beating academy prices. I will be going elsewhere for the better service and more knowledgable staff.
5	I appreciate Academy's price point.  I can usually find what I want in the right color and size when I visit this location.  Hopefully I didn't just jinx myself!!
4	First time at Academy Sports and I was Impressed.Up until yesterday, I had never been in Academy Sports but my wife wanted to pick up a few additional items to give her Grandson for Christmas and her Son had recommended Academy Sports.I can see why.Store is neat and well organized, The prices are right and they have ample stock.  Like most stores, they have cut back on floor people so it may take a bit to find someone but when you do, they are well trained and know exactly how to help you.Would suggest to anyone looking for Sporting Goods.
