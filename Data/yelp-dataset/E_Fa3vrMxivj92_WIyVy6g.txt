4	This location always turns out to be really convenient because it's attached to a BP gas station.  It's really cool when you can fill up your tank, buy a few snacks and pick up lunch or dinner.  The location is very clean and the staff is professional and always courteous.  The only confusing thing about the setup, is that the condiments are located around the corner in the dining room near the soda machine.One note for chocolate lovers:  If you're a big fan of the chocolate turnovers like I am; you'll want to get there before 9:30 pm, because they have a tendency to run out of those pretty early.
4	It has been while since I ate at an Arby's.  So long that I don't remember what used to order. Since the commercial Arby's have showing on tv I have been wanting to try it. Finally today I did. I ordered the Medium Combo, that is the rueben, fries, and drink for $8.29 before tax. that includes 60 cents for the upgrade to medium. The rueben, and fries were hot. The marble rye bread was so soft and tasty it does not have any rye seeds. I miss that I like the seeds on mine. The cornbeef had a nice flavor to it. Over all the sandwich was pretty good and all the flavors blended well. The things that I would fix to make this sandwich awesome would be: Spread the meat out over the bread so that would cause for more meat, add more thousand island dressing and saurkroute. And bam! You got an awesome rueben.
5	Arby's has always held a special place in my heart since childhood. My father and grandfather took me often...anyway love their chicken cordon bleu sandwich. Everything that I have had on their menu is good. I will say they are a little pricey though! The food is good, and they do have the meats! Lol
