5	This is MY Avis!  :-)  LOL.  Seriously -- Phylis, the owner of this wonderful establishment, is the BEST!
3	Avis's St. Rose Parkway branch is a small, independently run car rental agency serving the greater.... 7-Hills/Green Valley area. I have only used them a couple of times before and.... it's a typical car rental place. Prices can range from $$$$$ to dirt cheap but they do try and stay competitive. I guess if you need a rental car for a weekend trip or because your car breaks down, this would be the place to go.
5	This is my go-to when I need to rent a car.  The woman who runs it is very helpful, friendly and accommodating.  The vehicles are always in great condition and I've never had a problem.
5	I've rented 3 times this season to take my family skiing. Each time, Avis made it easy, provided me with a very clean vehicle, full tank of gas and zero hassle upon return.
5	Very easy to rent from this Avis office  plus they had better rates than any rental car company that was located at the Las Vegas airport.  The lady at the counter was nice and they have a drop off box in case you need to return your car on a Sunday or when their office is closed.  I would recommend this Avis office in Henderson NV.
