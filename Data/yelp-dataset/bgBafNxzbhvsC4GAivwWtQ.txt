4	We attended the Germany-US match public viewing while on a business trip to Bretten, Germany. A colleague invited us to watch the match at P10 because of the beach-y atmosphere. I admit, it was nice having sand on the deck and it did feel like a beach.We watched the match on the big screen under a white tent, which seems to be a permanent fixture. The couches were big and there were a lot of pillows. There was no sand where we were sitting under the tent. The selection of food was a bit disappointing, only small snacks and light sandwiches. Drink selection was good. Don't come there hungry.After the match was over, we went to the sand area and sat around and drank. We closed the bar at around 11pm. Unfortunately the owner seemed very upset with us that we had not left yet and that we weren't leaving as fast as he would like. My german isn't very good but he was kind of arguing with my colleague. I'm not sure what they were saying.The beach chairs were nice, the wait staff was attentive, the crowd was interesting. I'm not sure it was the best place to watch a soccer match. Definitely more fun after the match was over. There are umbrellas, and beds with canopies and those beach chairs with the canopies too. Overall very cool. Would go again.
