5	Nice people and great local business!
5	I needed a termite inspection in a hurry for VA and called Ambassador.  I left a message after hours and Frank called back with in 10 minutes.They had Jesus at my house to do the inspection and got me the paper work right away.   Both gentleman I dealt with were very professional.  I really appreciated the speedy service and how knowledgeable both guys were.
3	They are nice people and very friendly. Wasted no time in calling me back and setting up my appointment. The guys was on time to my house to do the inspection. However, I expected a little more than just looking at hole that rodent created and assuming that whole house was infested. Honestly, before quoting me what would turn out to be around $350 - $400, I would have appreciated if he would have looked around a little more to make sure it was actually necessary. Then I would have been more likely to accept the quote and hire them for this service and others. So I am giving them 3 stars. I am sure they are a great company and do great work, just the first impression did not make me feel comfortable with them.
