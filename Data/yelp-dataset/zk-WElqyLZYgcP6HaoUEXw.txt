1	Called Nana's Pet Sitting in mid July to book a pet sitter for Labor Day weekend; no answer, so I left a voice mail.  5 days later, no callback.  I called again, this time owner Linda answered.  She sounded flustered and tired, and said that she had just hired three new sitters, but was still understaffed, and that she had been working 12-15 hours a day to keep business afloat.  She said she would get back to me to set up a consult within one or two days, but if I had not heard from her within 3 more days, to call her again.  If you cannot even find time to call back a potential customer, and make said customer chase you down for the business, I will go elsewhere.  We ended up going with another company, called Pampered Paws....who were cheaper, nicer, more professional, and sounded happy to talk to us.  I would not recommend this company.
5	I have gotten to know the owner and a couple of her pet sitters over the past year, and while she can come off a little intense at times, she truly does love animals and cares for their well-being. Which in my opinion, that's what makes her business so successful. Yes she is incredibly busy, but she is reliable. She does a thorough background check on the sitters she hires to make sure they are honest and trustworthy, which is very important to me because I don't want to just let anyone in my house to take care of my 2 dogs and kitty. I also really like that they get my mail and can do overnight visits for when I go out of vacation. I will continue to use her services.
