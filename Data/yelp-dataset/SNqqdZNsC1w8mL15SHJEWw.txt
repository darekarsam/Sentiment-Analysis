1	If I could give it less than one star I would. I got a pizza from them last night and found a black hair in it. I called the manager who didn't seem very concerned. This is not the only unsanitary thing I've seen here. Definitely considering calling the health inspector. DON'T GET FOOD HERE!
3	Little Caesars is definitely a college classic!  Anyone who goes to Charlotte or lives in the University area knows about those nights, sitting in their apartment/dorm with empty pockets and empty stomachs.  The hunt is on!  Flip over the couch cushions, dig in the cracks, check the car, and scrounge up 6 bucks for a large pepperoni pizza on the fly!Some may not be fans, but hey, you get what you pay for.  And for $6, that is the best pizza one could hope to get.  I am definitely a fan of the Little Caesars.  Pizza! Pizza!
3	I definitely agree with Chris. You do get what you pay for. But you can't get a better pizza for cheaper! (or if you can someone let me know!) I love the crazy bread, definitely my favorite! Your meal is most likely incomplete without it. Being close to campus is a savior for any broke college kid craving pizza. Not the best, not the worst, all in all, I'm a fan of Little Caesar's!
1	The food is decent, you do pay for what you get.  My issue is the service.  I went in to get a pizza, and the guy taking orders went right past me several times.  After he let the third person who just walked into the store place an order before me, I let them know what I thought and walked out.  Never again.  I had rather buy a more expensive pizza at Papa Johns or Pizza Hut and get a little better service than get food here again.
4	Great pizza.. I would prefer some other places over this one if were talking favorites but I do hit this place up at least twice a month.. Good stuff
