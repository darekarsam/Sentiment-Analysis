5	DD Limo saved the day when our arranged transportation backed out the Thursday before a bachelor party weekend.We had 14 guys so I booked two limos with DD for Saturday night. The limos don't stay with you like a normal rented car/limo, but we arranged for them to transport us three separate times that night and it worked out fine.Each ride was $5 per person, the limos were legit, and on-time each pick-up.Thank god this worked out, because I think we all know it's really not cool to take a PAT Bus to the strip club.
4	You want to go to a bar that requires a drive, but a good cab is hard to come by in Pittsburgh. Why not rent a limo? These guys show up on time, and are friendly no matter what state your friends are in. $5 per person in the city, anytime, with a minimum of $20 per ride. $7 if you want to go to the suburbs. The limos are clean. Just be sure to schedule well in advance. You'll need to be flexible about pick up and drop off times, as the demand outstrips their available drivers.
4	My friends and I have used this place a few times to get to late night events. Can't go wrong with $5 per person each way. Just make sure everyone heading in the limo starts at the same location as they don't love picking people up all over town (I'm not even sure if they'll allow that).
4	DD Limo is a fantastic service! We used them over the weekend for my sister's 30th Birthday Party, and it was one of the highlights of the evening. The drivers were both professional and personable. They arrived right on time and took great care of us.If you need a great ride for a night out on the town and don't want to take a cab, call DD (just do it in advance!!!)The only thing that was a bit frustrating was getting in touch with them to make the reservation. We played phone tag for about a week before I was actually able to talk to a person. Other than that, they are absolutely fantastic!
