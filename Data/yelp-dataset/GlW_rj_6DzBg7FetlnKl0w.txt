1	Complete scam. Took our money & never showed up for our tour. Filing with BBB & anyone that will listen.
1	Paid money and they never showed up - waited for hours and no answer on the phone.  They are scam artists!
1	Made plans to take my girlfriend on this tour for her birthday. Live an hour and a half from Charlotte. Bought tickets a month in advance, made plans to make a whole day out of it. Got an email less than 24 hours prior to the tour, saying they hadn't sold enough tickets to conduct it. No mention of a minimum attendance anywhere on their website. Now I've got to scramble to come up with something else to do.
