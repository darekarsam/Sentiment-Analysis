5	I am extremely pleased with the service and follow-up that I have received from Dr. Pressley and her team. The office is very well presented. Most importantly the staff is very professional and attentive, to me that is a direct reflection of the ownership and the service that I hope to get from my doctor. A+
5	I had not had an exam in a couple years so I found Dr. Pressley's office and made an appointment.  The staff as well as Dr. Pressley  were very nice and helpful.  Everything was explained as it was being done.  They explained what all my benefits would cover and helped me find a new pair of glasses.
5	This office is amazing!!! I came in when they had just first opened their doors and man they did such an amazing job! Took care of everything with my insurance and had me in n out pretty fast (i came on my lunch break). Very efficent and i will always come back here !!!
5	If you are looking for good old fashioned customer care, this is the place to go.  My son lost his glasses and we needed to get new ones asap.  I called several places and explained our dilemma and I was told one to two weeks!  Then the wonderful Bev at optic gallery answered the phone!  She assured me if my son had a standard prescription she would get him glasses by the end of the day!   We scheduled our appointment for immediately after school,my son had an exam with the doctor and Bev did her magic and now his glasses are being made to be picked up by six! They were not only able to get him glasses but did so in time for me to get my youngest daughter to swim class on time!
