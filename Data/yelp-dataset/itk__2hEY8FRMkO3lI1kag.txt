4	Quick takeout pizza not many varieties but it's always consistently good
5	Fast and fresh. I have to rate this place because everytime I go in, I'm impressed.  No matter how slammed they are, It's always fast.  Employees bust there butts here.  $5 pizza is a great value
5	Great option when you need to feed hungry kids and don't have time to cook dinner. I always ask to wait for a fresh hot n ready pizza so it's nice and hot when we get home. I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for them to cook a fresh pizza, as they are continually making them. Only cost $5, and I prefer this pizza over greasy Pizza Hut any day.
1	Extremely disappointed In the lack of customer service. We called in an order on what was expected to be a busy for the knowingly slow establishment. Called in the order at 5:45 pm for a 6:45 pm pick up. At 7:30 I had to demand my order. After watching walk in orders be fulfilled prior to my call in. You get what you pay for by way of customer service. I am only grading one star because the application requires at least 1.
