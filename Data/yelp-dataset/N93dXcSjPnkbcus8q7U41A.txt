4	I like this place.  Soups are great.  Its a mix of Japanese Thai and Chinese.  not expansive and quick service.  Great for a quick lunch.  I like the general Tao chicken!
3	Not everything on the menu is great. I always love the pad Thai because I end up with enough for an extra meal to take home. The service is fast if you don't come at peak hours and very friendly.
4	We were recently introduced to this restaurant by friends.  We thoroughly enjoyed the meal and the restaurant has become one of our "go-to" places when we are just too tired to cook or just want to treat ourselves.We always go with the combos - more GOOD food than the two of us could eat at one sitting and we usually ask to wrap and go, the leftovers.  I don't have one favourite dish; I love them all!  The restaurant is clean and airy.  The staff is friendly, polite and professional.  Very easy ambiance making conversation easy.  Pricing is low to moderate.  Highly recommend this spot.
