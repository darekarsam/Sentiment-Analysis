4	Quite tasty though in lebanon u can find tastier ones.Bit pricy I felt..
4	I'm addicted to the Canarias! The achta is just amazing!!! The home made ice cream is really good especially the achta ice cream....and there's even ice cream for diabetics. A little bit on the expensive side but doesn't keep me away. Love that it's open very late. Not too crazy about he atmosphere though...maybe they can work on that a bit...make it a little more professional and welcoming. It wouldn't hurt for the staff to smile a bit...just saying ; )
2	I tried it yesterday upon recommendation of some friends, it was a quiet disappoint for me! I ordered 2 things, one salty and one sweet.- Very slow service, you stand in the line to order, wait in the cash line to pay, wait again to take your order and hoping no one else will mix his/her order with yours. I waited approx 25 minutes to take 2 things!!!- Quiet pricy comparing to what you get.- Quality of food is ok, but not as I expected.- Staff are not trained enough nor quick enough.In the end, it's good to try, but for me that's it.
3	Great selection of deserts that will not disappoint anyone. The ice cream with the fruit salad is really tasty. Chocolate crebs are  amazing. One thing I didn't like that all the workers they use their bare hands, no gloves, to pick or cut the fruit. I should've screamed foul. They only take cash.
