4	This is not my usual place, but when in town it's the only nail salon I will go to. I can always walk in and get service. Everyone is friendly and I love that they use OPI products. For a pedi with scrub I only paid $27 + tip. It's cheap and definitely worth it!
5	I've been to a few of the many nail salons in Maricopa and Enke Nails & Spa is the best! The staff is friendly and the quality of the service and product is high!
5	The stylists and colorists at this salon are not messing around - they take your hair seriously, and actually listen to what you want. I'm a huge fan of Sheridan since I saw the remarkable transformation she made when an old boyfriend of mine went to see her. This guy went from clown fro to style after one session, and he refuses to have anyone else touch his hair since then. Although  I'm a little bit of a princess when it comes to my hair, I've never been so comfortable or impressed by a stylist. To top it off, Enke Nails and Spa is reasonably priced, and the service is excellent.
