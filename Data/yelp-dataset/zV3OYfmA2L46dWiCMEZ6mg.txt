4	I think I might fall in love with this place after a few visits!Location: Notre-Dame West, in the not-so-ghetto part of town. I think this place also falls into the 'Southwest' category but frankly, it's probably the only part of town I'm not that familiar with so if I'm wrong, let me know! It's definitely in the happening section of Notre-Dame; lots of business and hustle and bustle. I like it. Service: First, this place is quite small, but they have a terrace out back. I loved the decor and ambiance - it felt very cozy and warm. As well, when I walked in, I was immediately hit by the scent of something that I'm sure, was damn good eats. There seemed to be some confusion amongst the wait staff about who was doing the seating. In fact, the person who eventually took charge of this was bloody spacey - how hard is it to understand that our group had 3 people and the next group had 5? I won't dock points for that because she was quite lovely as she waited our table later on.  That said, overall, service was a little bit slow.Food: This time around, I didn't have anything to eat other than dessert, so will definitely go back for the full dining experience. We shared the cherry-blueberry pie, and the blueberry baba (two doughy things soaked in brandy with fresh blueberries and whipped cream). If the dessert is any indication of what the mains taste like, I am in LOVE. The pie was delicious - they used REAL cherries, yo! None of that canned crap! The crust was crumbly and overall, the pie was just the right level of sweetness. Also, they were NOT cheap on the portion. The baba was something I expected not to like, but happily, I was mistaken. That whole dish was bloody incredible. Yum yum yum. The whipped cream was fresh, the blueberries were fresh and the doughy things were the perfect texture and consistency, and drenched in brandy. What more can a girl ask for?They seem to have a decent wine selection and my partners in crime seemed to enjoy their white and reds, respectively. I had a latte. It was OK but I've had better. Price: Reasonable for dessert. Will report back on the mains. I did see the chef preparing each dish, so can tell you that everything looks to be prepared fresh upon order, which is a definite bonus. This place should be considered a neighborhood gem if it's not already.
5	The Joe Beef guys opened a wine bar. That was pretty much all that I needed to hear. It took just over a month after its opening but I headed down to the corner of Charlevoix and Notre-Dame (which at this point is probably my most visited street block in the city outside of the Jean Talon Market and my own apartment) with a friend for a little early weekend dinner.The first thing you notice when you walk in is the visual differences between it and its brethren. No crazy or folksy paraphernalia on the walls. A very clean and elegant look with white brick, white tiles, wood tables and black leather. The entire right side of the narrow space is a beautiful bar where all the prep work is done. There is also a small relatively sparse terrasse in the back with communal tables. Overall, there is a sleeker look in keeping with a wine bar but once you add the blackboard menus and the alternative music, it keeps that Joe Beef/Liverpool House feel that I love.Like its brethren, Le Vin Papillon has no set menu on paper. When you enter, there is one blackboard with the day's menu listed as well as a couple that list the wine choices they have by the bottle. Surprisingly enough for a wine bar concept, they don't have very many selections by the glass. It is almost all by the bottle. The wines were mostly French and Italian from my browsing of the choices. The wines I tried were selected by our waiter because, to be honest, I have a complete lack of knowledge of wine outside of California so I figured he would be in a better place to provide me a good glass. Both were quite good but I won't go into details here. I'll stick to the food. The menu is very interesting in that it is very light on meats which is really separates it from both other restaurants. The dishes are mainly vegetables based and are very much dishes design to accompany wine and share amongst your dining party.First up, we went with the haricots-coco-romano. Local quebec green beans with some prosciutto, sun-dried tomatoes, romano cheese and beans tossed in some olive oil. As will be a pretty consistent theme through the meal, this plate was a great showcase of local produce with a few augments to enhance and up the flavours. The sun-dried tomatoes and the romano were nice pairings with the crisp green beans. The olive oil allowed all the ingredients to blend nicely.We followed that up with a selection of their cheeses of the day. Again, we left the choices up to the staff with the caveat of no blue cheese (still not a favorite of mine by itself). We got 3 out of the 7 they were offering that day. Great selection by the staff as they mixed up the texture and the tastes nicely. With the cheese, we got a plate of toasted artisan loaf bread with butter as well as fresh nuts to crack and enjoy. Loved the bread - thank god they didn't leave a basket at the table during the whole meal because I wouldn't have stopped eating it. As from the nuts, I love the idea but the practice of cracking them at the table is a little messier than is ideal. Next up, we went with the roasted onion and ricotta cheese. Just a great dish and a kind of item pairing that in hindsight I wished I had thought up sooner. Fresh creamy ricotta cheese with a beautifully roasted sweet onion and some more of that bread. Absolutely no complaints here.The final dish of our first selection was the chicken wings with tarragon. Nice flavours here and the wings were cooked as they should be, however I feel this was the least successful dish but only because of the impractically of eating wings at a wine bar. A little too messy and sticky to enjoy with a glass of wine even when trying to eat them neatly.   Still somewhat hungry, we decided to order a couple of more plats. First up this time, their rotisserie Cauliflower. Yeah, that's right. This dish was by far the most unique thing we had this evening. Roasted cauliflower with thyme, crispy chicken skin, candied lemon peels and a spicy oil mixture on top. A surprisingly spicy dish but one with great texture and crunch from the roasted cauliflower and the chicken skin. Very enjoyable.We then went with our waiter's suggestion of the vinegar eggplant. Roasted eggplants topped with a tomato/almond mixture, some melted cheese, some fresh basil and of course, as the name implies, vinegar. Nice earthy flavours throughout with the sweetness of the tomatoes, the richness of the cheese and the acidity of the vinegar mixed in. A surprisingly filling dish on top of all that. Very well done.To finish the whole thing off, I went with a homemade chocolate truffle with some fresh blueberries. Rich creamy chocolate interior coated with some crushed pistachios for a little nutty crunch. Perfectly done and the perfect sweet touch to cap off the meal.Overall, a very nicely executed wine bar concept and one with a menu that surprises with its emphasis on vegetables. A few dishes and some wine glasses later, you leave stuffed and quite satisfied.
4	I went back for dinner a few weeks ago and can confirm that the Joe Beef dudes done good. We ordered a few different dishes, and they were all freshly prepared and dee-licious. I should have written my review sooner because now, I can't remember what I ate other than the cheese plate. That's the trouble with aging =-DI don't really thing you can go wrong with this place - each dish seems to be prepared with love, the menu is seasonal so you can try something new each time you stop in, and their desserts? HELLO! If you stop by for no other reason, they will be totally worth your while. The wait staff is great, and the vibe rocks. This is a great place to check out on a cold winter afternoon -  bring a book, order a glass of wine and just chillax. THEN order dinner.If you get there around 5:30-6pm, you should be good to get a table. They don't take reservations so you want to get there early.See my initial review for praise on their yummy desserts!
4	VERY GOOD. This is a relatively small "wine bar" with indoor and outdoor seating. At the time I visited they didn't have a bar license so we were required to order at least 1 food item (not a bad thing to say the least). This is one of the chalkboard bistros, so take a photo as you pass by the daily listings, otherwise you'll end up standing over random people staring at a list posted on the wall above their table. he food was really good, but be careful of time of day you visit, sometimes only cold items are available. Also, if you're lucky, you may get a tour of the garden that feeds the 3 restaurants (also including Joe Beef & Liverpool House).
5	VIBE This place reminds me of Paris. Straight from the mirrors to the banquettes to the layout of the restaurant. Paris, Paris, Paris. In the very best way. Everyone knows Dave and Fred of Joe Beef but you really need to know Vanya and Marco. Just lovely folks who really care about food, service and people. FOOD I HATE Cauliflower. Capital letters H A T E. Where is the nutritional value? It's white? It looks disgusting. It's spraypainted broccoli (another childhood repulsion but at least it has nutritional value). Vin Papillon's touch with fried chicken bits and fat drizziling over the cauliflower made me a believer. So any chef that can turn a food you hate into a food you like is the mark of a true chef. I had the pickled plate. It was nice but I think I was expecting more pickles and less of a veg medley. Maybe I was lost in translation? It's filling if you do get it. Rum soaked baba will make you drunk and the wine gums (with wine!) are delicious. Basically the menu is date friendly and it really is a great date place and of course, with lovely natural wines. A nicer, lighter version of Joe Beef fare. Joe Beef lite? OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK Floats like a butterfly but doesn't sting like a bee. Def. in the top favourite restaurants of Montreal list.
5	The Joe Beef guys have done it again!Stellar wine and snack bar a few steps away in what is probably the most famous restaurant block in Canada.Like other posters have mentioned, there are no reservations here, it is first-come-first served so try to make it here around five pm before everyone leaves work and you'll be fine. There is enough variety here to keep you coming back since menu options change all the time. Of course mainstays like cheese, pickles, nuts and bread will always be around but why not try lesser-known items like the lettuce with Bottarga (i.e shaving of salty fish eggs which the Sardinians go crazy for)? I did yesterday and it was fabulous and now I'm a convert.Also don't skip on dessert. We tried the Paris-Brest and it was easily one of the best I've had. They got the puff pastry and cream right down to the right consistency.The real "star" here of course is the variety of wines. With two giant blackboards with white and red selections, you're bound to find something you like. Montreal needs more wine and snack bars catering to more sophisticated palates with such reasonable prices. Between Le Vin Papillon and La Buvette Chez Simone and given how they are always, always packed and fill up within a hairs breath of time, clearly the people have spoken.
5	Join my voice to the chorus, what a nice experience! The move for sure is to duck out of work early, get here at 4:30 like we did and the black banquets are wide open and the friendly, funny, wise, calm woman who seats you and knows all the wines and food by heart will give you the corner of your choice. The counters are piled with fresh homemade bread and beautiful cheese wheels under glass domes. Take a photo of the blackboards on your way in to read at your seat and leisure, one is entirely delicious food and the other is wine by the bottle, but really based on my experience your best bet is just chatting with the amazing wait staff about what you feel like eating and what they are excited to be serving that night and you won't be led astray. Just down the street from Joe Beef and Liverpool this lovely little slip of a room is tasteful and perfect and calm and bright and I love it. Expensive but not crazy and so totally worth it when every bite is dreamy. I'll be back for sure.
5	Merci to Macks and Lisa.  My son and I visited Montreal for the Gran Prix du Canada this past weekend.  Our first night in Montreal, we went to Joe Beef; we got there too early.  A wonderful employee escorted us down the street to their sister restaurant, Le Vin Papillon, introduced us to Macks and asked him to take care of her new friends.  The wine, the food, the new friends from the terrace  - wonderful.  This is a restaurant not to be missed by anyone visiting the city.  We visited again on our third evening in town.  Again Macks (and Lisa) made our evening special.  We even traded a few recipes.  If you are looking for cheap, fast food this is not the place for you.  If you are looking for a place to relax and enjoy some of Montreal's best wine, food and friends, you have found it here.MikeFort Collins, Colorado, USA
5	First off, we were from out of town trying to head to Joe Beef, without reservations, but we arrived an hour before they opened.  We went here and were delightfully treated to the nicest waiter(whom I forget his name) who basically curated our eating experience. Is this what they do here? Mind you I couldn't read the menu from my seat but I was pleased as to how attentive this dude was. When time was running out I told him that we were just trying to get two seats and offered to help. He got us those seats and settled the bill....I just wish we didn't eat so much food here and went to Joe Beef with virgin stomachs but not really.This place was amazing.
5	I was in town with a bunch of friends and we really wanted to try joe beef! We had no chances of getting a reservation, esp it being july 4th weekend - there was quite a good amount of tourists in town! So based on yelp reviews we headed here!!! And i must say, it was sensational!!! We arrived at the restaurant and was seated about 20 minutes later. They were packed as well, but we were real lucky! The 6 of us were seated in a far corner and couldnt see much of the menu ( oh, so the menu is all written on the walls with chalk!! No handouts period...) We were all a bit skeptical at first not knowing how to proceed. The person waiting on us was quite smug and almost condescending in the beginning... Let's jus say he was snobbish about his restaurant.  But as mentioned in another review, he went on to narrate our meal for the evening. Once he got talking, he mellowed down and got more friendly. The recommendations were epic. The food is essentially tapas style... So u order a large variety of small quantities.. We had their take on chicken wings, mushroom and potatoes from the grill, a radish with special butter combo, some pic cauliflower from the grill, amazing red wines and some epic deserts... The amount of though put into the selection of flavors is mind boggling. Everything tasted amazing, and was their take on some traditional dish at times. Its a great place for date night.
4	A perfect place to spend a summer Saturday night outdoors!!!  Only in Montreal you will find a gem like this. Completely unassuming atmosphere as you were dining in your own backyard with the little vegetable garden and grill.  The food was amazing.  Sliced ham and cheese on buttery cornbread in a husk.  The Spanish styled tapas potatoes with fried chives were  just the best.  We had had the grilled chicken wings.The corn sundae for dessert was also very tasty.
5	Oh. My. Gosh. Everything was so simple but flavorful and delicious.We sat in the cozy and cute backyard in beautiful weather.  We started with a yummy aperitif cocktail and proceeded to enjoy some grilled herbal chicken, a cheese and nuts plate and also a corn and cheese curds appetizer.  I think about the food all the time coz it was so good!
3	We went for dinner last friday. We didn't do reservation so we had to wait about 25 minutes, not bad for a friday night at this hour... Anyway, weGot the table at the front, we were 3 people and we were seat in a small table (usually for 2), so we didn't have enough space.The wine list is ok, but in my opinion, a bit overprice.We didn't look at the menu, but the waitress offer to chose by us so we did it like like that. The food was amazing, small plates full of taste. Perfect for the wine bar ambiance also.Finally, the dessert were delicious and in a good size. Perfect to share if you wish.I give 3 stars instead of 4, not for the food, but I feel it was a bit expensive. We ending up paying $75 each with only one bottle of wine.Good experience to go on a date or hang out with friends, but not to go more than once.
5	I have been here a number of times by myself while I have been working in Montreal and it has continued to amaze and delight me. I give that staff full freedom to choose what excites them or the kitchen. On Monday night I took my family there and they could not believe the quality of food and wine. It is a sensational spot. The vegetables dishes are amazing. Let yourself be guided by the staff and not by what you have always eaten.
5	Outstanding.....Stopped in for share plates, on a casual Thursday. We asked the waitress to bring us a couple exciting dishes. The celery root with anchovy vinaigrette was something we would not specifically order but was stunned at the sweetness of the root vegetable and the perfect overtones of fat and acidity from the vinaigrette.Winner was the Guinea Fowl Confit (apparently sourced from a northern Quebec farm) so impressive we ordered a second helping, The fat was completely rendered out, left with a moist wine soaked dark meat. Memories of a 5* Coq Au Vin.Wine list was approachable and reasonably priced. Different, inspiring, engaging and impressive
5	+++Open late when Joe Beef isn'tIdk what sparkling wine I ordered, it was similar to cava, but it wasn't cava. But it was a gamble that paid offbilingual staffI don't think I've tasted 3 tastes that complemented each other as the cuisse/mustard/slaw combo++Service; waitresses are very friendly. They will literally sit down and chat with you about dishes, or give you information on whatever you like (I've seen this done twice, and it they did it with me!)Cauliflower with chicken was the bomb, and the crispy chicken skin was the best partWe really liked the eggplant dip90s hip hop soundtrack was cool+Stuffed plums was great, because it utilized the natural sweetness of the plums, so it was nit overly sugary and overly dense-- The jambon was pretty much just ham and cheese, like from a sandwich, without the breadTIPS:If there's a wait, which there most likely will be, take a picture of menu, or persue te menu and make a game plan before seatingFYI (four meals, 3 wines, dessert) was roughly $130 including tip
4	This charming little restaurant on the strip next to Liverpool House and Joe Beef is a breath of fresh vegetables on a street where it's historically been nearly impossible to eat anything that didn't used to have parents.No but really. Le Vin Papillon does serve meat (and seafood of course) but offers a large variety of veggie dishes and yummy cheeses for those who aren't into eating animals, and most of these veggie options are not just incredibly original (like celery root carpaccio) but totally delicious as well.Their wine selection is pretty good too plus they have quite a few to choose from by the glass so you won't be disappointed there.They don't take reservations and there is usually a considerable wait at the door but it's well worth it. The food is yummy and the space is pretty (plus the lighting is muy romantic for a date).I would suggest trying this spot out if you are a small group (2 to 4 people max) and going a little bit before you are so starving you could eat the east side of a west bound skunk. Once you get there, you might want to order a glass of wine to sip while you are standing around and maybe even try the smoked eggplant caviar app. It's easy to share and eat on your feet.
4	Called up Joe Beef our first night in Montreal back in October. They were full but they referred us to their sister restaurant to dine in. On a Friday night, le vin papillon was packed and lively. Dark & elegant decor. We were seated within 15mn of waiting for a table. While waiting,  we enjoyed a glass of wine from their extensive list. The servers were busy but still very attentive. In fact, they would occasionally sit and spark up conversation with diners. Their seasonal menu is written on the chalkboard wall so they ask you to take a good look at it or take a picture before sitting down. We had no idea what to order. Thankfully, our waitress was very helpful with guiding us. Here are the highlights of what we had. Their best dishes are the ones featuring a roasted veggie. **Rotisserie Cauliflower (one of the best veggie dishes I've had) **chicken wings (delicious) **Eggplant dip **Jambon (least favorite, too basic) **Stuffed plums (my husband really enjoyed them) Really great atmosphere, good quality food. Prices were a little high end, especially for the wine glasses.
