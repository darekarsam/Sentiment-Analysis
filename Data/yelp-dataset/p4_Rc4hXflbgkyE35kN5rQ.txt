5	So...have you ever done any stripping? Not the kind that requires nekkid-ness. The kind that requires the patience of the Dalai Lama, the chemicals of Monsanto, and the persistence of Abraham Lincoln. It's an ugly, ugly job...most people hate doing it...especially when the paint is caked on...a dozen layers of god-only-knows what kind and color. Plus, it's hard to breath without getting dizzy...the fumes are awful. And your hands get sore. Why does anyone sign up for that torture???Enter Allison's and the big dipping vat. Get this...they dunk your over-painted, ugly, about to kill you because you can't scrape it anymore piece of furniture (in my case, some drawers and my bathroom door) into a giant vat of paint-removing awesomeness. Viola! Done.And it's cheap. Because I think my time is worth more than $3 an hour (after buying all the crap I needed to actually strip it). Plus, the massage I needed after all those hours of trying to strip the stupid door was almost as much as just getting the door stripped. Now I know better...and now you do too. Don't strip it yourself. Save yourself from mind-numbing, back-breaking work and go here. (They pick up too just in case you don't have the balls to strap your bathroom door on your car's top with some twine and drive 25 from your house to the stripper's hoping for no wind.)
1	The second refinishing business I have had to give a poor review to. Apparently these businesses are too busy to respond to emails requesting an estimate. Apparently they are too busy to bother with a small job. Truly disappointed, but the place I DID receive a response from is awesome. I will continue to use their services, and NOT these others, including Allison's.
