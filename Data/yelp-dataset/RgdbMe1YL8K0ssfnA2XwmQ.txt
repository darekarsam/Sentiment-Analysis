4	Great restaurant, the food was fantastic and the staff were very friendly and nice. I had the linguine with gambas (prawns) and it was great (15 euros)--just the right amount of sauce. They also had my favorite Italian dish (spaghetti with vongoles) (12 euros) though I opted to try something different this time around. I would not put this restaurant with 3 $$$, the prices are extremely reasonable. Tiramisu for 4.50 euros, small mixed salad for 4 euros, and most of the pasta dishes are around 11-15 euros. Also very convenient (within a 5 minute walk) from the Ibis Hotel and the train station.
