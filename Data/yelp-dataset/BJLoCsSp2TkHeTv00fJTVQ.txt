3	This Pizza Hut is just a take-out location, no eat-in; they may do delivery also.  It's best if you call your order ahead and stop by to pick it up rather than dropping by. If you drop in and order, you'll need to wait about 15 minutes for your order. They have their best-selling pizzas and 2-liter sodas. They're on the corner in a busy, tight shopping area on N 16th Street.
5	Good service at this location, Robert acknowledges you as soon as you walk in the door.. Orders are always correct too
5	Called today to place a large order to send to a local business as a thank you for helping us out.  Spoke to Jeff who worked out an AMAZING deal with us for a group of pizzas. Then after he got my card number, he discounted it some more.  Excellent customer service and price.  The pizza was enjoyed by everyone!
1	Worst service and pizza!!!  Just ordered Chicken BBQ and I got something totally not Chicken BBQ.  So I called them to let them know we got the wrong pizza and they keep hanging up on me.  I didn't even get to tell them.  I just said I got the wrong pizza and they keep telling me to hold then hangs up.  My favorite pizza is Pizza Hut but not this location for sure.  If I can give -star I would.
1	HOORIBLE. you ask for something special on the order - the pizza cooked well done - and it doesn't happen. Worst thing is in got bread sticks that were coated in butter. What the world. I called the store and spoke to them answer on duty, Brain, and he acted as if this was a bother and didn't have time. Go across the street to the other pizza places.
5	Had a great example of good customer service tonight with Brian! Also the pizza was delicious but customer service makes all the difference.
