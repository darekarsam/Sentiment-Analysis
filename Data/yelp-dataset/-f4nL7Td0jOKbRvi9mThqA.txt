5	The fries are SO GOOD! I often get the bavette or veal liver, always perfectly cooked. They have a lobster dish in the summer that is great too!
1	I've tried Essence! J'ai vraiment essaye!!! Twice I've been for lunch and twice I've been disappointed. And it isn't cheap either!Today I had the pizza with prosciutto and arugula. I think that is one of the most basic pizzas you can make. It's just a plain cheese pizza with meat and raw salad on top.Now the issues, where do I begin???1) there was zero sauce on my pizza... Ok, maybe a slight exaggeration but pretty close. There was enough cheese for the personal pizza but it was so dry2) they burnt part of the crust. It could have come out a bit earlier because it absolutely cut up the top of my mouth!!My lunch date had the brevette of beef... It wasn't a great cut of meat. There were chewy parts and he had it medium rare... The fries that came with it seemed good and he enjoyed the started caesar since it was part of the host table.Some positives?Great outdoor section, roomy and for lunch, in the shade.Loved their hot oil. Wasn't crazy hot but packed a sweet punch.
