5	I hired this company to remove an old chain-link fence in my backyard. They did an excellent job of removing the posts, and even removed metal that was imbedded in trees that had grown up into the fence. They hauled the debris away and left the area clean. It cost me less than half of what the other leading Pittsburgh fence company quoted me for the project. I also appreciated that the company sent me a detailed contract with a drawing beforehand, even though the project was small. Paul always returned my phone calls the same day, and Bill even answered his phone in the evening.
5	Excellent workmanship. Both sales and installation managers were helpful and kept me well informed. The price was also a few hundred dollars less than another bid. I would highly recommend these guys for any residential installation.

They came out quickly to give the estimate, which was lower than I had expected.  Once I returned the contract, they called to schedule the work.  I was on the schedule right at the busiest time of the year for them, but they were very accommodating when I called to ask if they could bump me up due to some hostility from the neighbors.  Ed and Allen came out and made fast work of it.  They set the posts one day and finished the next.  They were very professional, making sure I was on the same page as them before starting work.  When they left, the only evidence that they'd been there was the beautiful fence they left.  Everything was tidy-- they even used the dirt from the post holes to fill a hole in my front yard.
