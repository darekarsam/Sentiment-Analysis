4	Love having this little market in my neighborhood! Great place to get some delicious coffee (from Zeke's), a snack, or some fresh produce for dinner. Also, everyone is SUPER friendly. Can't wait to come back and try out their sandwich menu.
5	Fantastic neighborhood market! Excellent variety of items from beautiful fresh produce to locally baked breads & ice cream to salty snack foods.  Incredibly friendly staff as well.  A true asset to Upper Lawrenceville.
5	Friendly staff. Great breakfast sandwiches. Good produce. This is a great little place to walk to on a Saturday morning to grab some groceries and a sandwich/ coffee to start your day. The sandwiches are made in house and they'll put it on the press for you to heat it up.
