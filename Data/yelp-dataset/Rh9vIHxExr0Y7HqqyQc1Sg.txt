3	Played tennis here the other day and was very impressed with the park overall. Since the tennis courts are all the way in the back of the park I got the opportunity to drive through most of the park. Very large and a nice hidden gem off of Beatties Ford Road, just north of the Sunset Blvd exit (west). A few highlights of the park are below... As for the tennis courts, the were OK. They were a little dirty and had some cracking. The lights flickered from time to time which got a little annoying as it got darker in the night. The 12 courts are split into 2 groups of 6. There is plenty of parking and seating if you're there to watch as well. Not as nice as some of the other public tennis facilities around Charlotte, but I'd definitely play there again. Next time, maybe I'll leave some more time to check out the whole park. 102 acres 4-field lighted tournament softball complex 18-hole disc golf course 12 lighted tennis courts 2 horseshoe pits 8 picnic shelters 2 Playground units BMX bicycle track Indoor shelter Full court basketball court (2) Lake with fishing pier Concession stand Restrooms Sand Volleyball Courts (2)
5	Hornets Nest is a fantastic Charlotte area park that has something for everyone!  Tennis courts, baseball fields... A BMX course? Wha- Wha- Wha- Whaaat?  And of course, there is my personal favorite, the disc golf course.  The 2012 PDGA World Disc golf Championship finals were held here.  It was a great event.  Tons of free stuff, vendors, and of course following the disc golfers around!
