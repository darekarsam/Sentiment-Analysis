3	They were very helpful in here.  I went in needing an oil and air filter for my car.  They didn't have them in stock, but were more than glad to order them from their warehouse for me, and they arrived within 24 hours.  Their prices are just a bit more expensive when compared to Auto Zone.  You'll find a few items in here that may be priced the same or a dollar or two cheaper, but for the most part there are priced just a hair about AZ. The staff was all very nice...knowledgeable and helpful.  Also for those with brake rotor problems, they will turn your rotors here as long as there is enough left for them to safely be turned.  And they'll do it for only $15 a pair.  That's a lot cheaper than most any mechanic shop you'll find!
5	I like this place because the staff has been very nice and helpful every time I've been in there. I've only been in for oil change materials and the stuff I needed was cheaper than Auto Zone. Most of the Auto Zone's I've been to have usually been rude or ignored me. Possibly because I'm a women but I've never had a problem with Oriellys. :)
5	This review is for Mike at the 3395 Durango Drive as well as for Stephen at this store on Tropicana.  Replacing hood struts on a 1994 Toyota Camry.  Easy to do IF you have all the correct parts.  Mike went out of his way to find the parts in stock.  The struts in the store were w/o the brackets.  He called the Tropicana store.  They had them.  Pulled them, and reserved them at the fron desk.  I got them and install was a breeze.  Thanks for your hard work MIKE at the Durango store and Stephen at the Tropicana store.
