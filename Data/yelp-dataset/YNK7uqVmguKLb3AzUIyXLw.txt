3	This was my first visit to this location for breakfast using a BOGO coupon.  It was located in the Fiesta Rancho Casino in Las Vegas.  It took a few minutes to be seated. I ordered the Santa Fe Skillet and my friend ordered the Senior Fit breakfast.  The food came out fairly fast.We went to the cash register to pay.  Again, it took a few minutes for someone to come up front.
5	It's Denny's. can't go wrong with this place after a Late night of fun at 2am. The server was more than helpful in assisting my wasted husband and friends. Good location.
1	Wait time was terrible! When we did get our food the eggs were cold.  Waitress was nice, I know not her fault for the cooking time.
1	Ok so I've been here 20 minutes. 10 minutes to get someone to seat me. 5 minutes waiting to order. Another 5 minutes since I got my coffee but can't stir in my cream and sugar because no silverware. So far Denny's sucks.
