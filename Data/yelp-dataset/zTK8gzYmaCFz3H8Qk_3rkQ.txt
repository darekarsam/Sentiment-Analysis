5	Bryan Nuorala and his team are the best.Just got my buyer's loan docs to title A WEEK EARLY.This avoids last minute DRAMA most of the other lenders out there seem to enjoy.They do everything in house; processing, underwriting, and table funding.I send all my buyers to Bryan after their lender fails to perform, or starts to miss deadlines.Bryan Nuorala (602) 881-0988
5	My experience with Dean Wegner and his colleagues at Academy Mortgage was absolutely exceptional from start to finish! Dean kept me well informed during my loan process and he found a loan that suited my unique needs. (I had a short sale 4 yrs ago.) He was always available and made sure I understood the whole process and answered my questions thoroughly and timely. The personalized videos of my loan's progress was fabulous. I loved them and they are so unique and I have never seen anything like them. Dean is amazing and I be back when I have any other mortgage needs and I will also refer anyone who will listen how great I was treated and how satisfied I am with my loan. Thanks much for everything!
1	Jim Barker, Debbie Wilson and Ashley Ford.  Avoid!  My loan went pass the date and the sellers are pissed and put in a 3 day cure notice.  Now they are asking for items that they should of asked for weeks ago.  I don't think they even open the Email that I sent them, unprofessional and I will probably lose this house and money because of there mistakes.  Process was the worst, thank God we got the house
