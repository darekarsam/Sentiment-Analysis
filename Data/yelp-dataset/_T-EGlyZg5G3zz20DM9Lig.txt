5	Best place to get a haircut in the valley. The owner really knows his stuff and is with the long wait on a Friday
5	I have been to a lot of barbers in the Phoenix area and hands down this barber shop is the bomb!!! After you get your cut from any one of the barbers here, you'll be back!! Great atmosphere,fast cuts,good vibe in here. Highly recommend this barber shop for any one who wants a precision fade!!
5	I've just moved to Phoenix and am really glad that I stopped by this Barber shop for a cut!  I've had very good cuts at my barber back east, but I have to say that the attention to detail was great.   Definitely stop by, you'll be glad that you did.
5	Great barbershop, great atmosphere. I personally go to my guy Danny but everyone here is legit. Most importantly It's never a long wait!
5	I've always struggled with a consistent barber shop until I found patrons. Ever since my first hair cut there I  have always been pleased to leave the shop with a great hair cut. All the barbers are professional and always hold great and memorable conversations. I always recommend patrons barber shop so give it a shot you won't regret it.
5	I went to the same shop for 20 years till they retired. Found lots of sucky places,   I met Danny and told me he was a barber so I rolled down and had him give me a new cut and look. Shop is fun to hang in and I am STOKED to find someone that knows how to cut my hair the right way. I even take my kid too and he is really hard to cut but Danny makes it happen.
5	Been goin to this barbershop for years after I was first introduced to it by a friend. The barbers there are great guys, you get a great haircut for a affordable price. I'd definitely recommend this barbershop over the others
5	Great service, friendly staff especially Kevin. Danny and the guys here at Patron are great barbers and take pride in their cuts. Thanks for keeping me groomed weekly and getting me in at short notice most of the time.
