5	This is the former home of Chill-N-Yogurt. Now it's Froyo Time and what a difference!The place has been remodeled with bright new paint, new tables and chairs and a completely cleaned up counter section. All toppings are fully stocked and tidy. Most importantly, the service is excellent. Most of the frozen yogurt places I've visited are staffed by what seems to be extras from The Walking Dead - totally out of it and not at all happy to be working. This isn't the case here. Management is enthusiastic and definitely 100% customer centric.   Looking forward to my next visit!
5	formerly known as Chillin-Yogurt now renamed and new owners! (I did like the former and miss My alot!) we dropped in to try out the new store and it is nice and clean freshly painted. I enjoyed the yogurt and they had lots of toppings to choose from.
5	Great froyo, very happy I ordered from here, and I was able to get it delivered too!
1	Is this place even open? Same problem they had when they were chill-n yogurt. Their yelp and grub hub both say they're open until 10, but when I show up at 8:15 they are closed. It's the only yogurt shop close to my house and I've never been so frustrated by a local business in my life. Get your shit together.
5	I stopped by and checked out froyotime as I eat next door at zabbas frequently and noticed the new froyo shop going up.  It was really good, and the owners, who both were in the shop at the time, seemed like really nice people.  I had the Salted caramel and it was delicious, didnt even need toppings although they had a ton of those as well.  Will definitely be back!
5	This place is great. It is fresh and clean and has a bright cheery feel. There is always a new flavor to try and lots of choices to choose from at the toppings bar. The owners are always friendly and great to talk to.
