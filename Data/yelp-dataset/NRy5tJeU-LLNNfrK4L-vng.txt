1	There's no reason to be cheap on hiring better delivery workers, they were very rude and acted like they didn't want to be there.
3	I have been here twice.The first time, we purchased our couch. Around $1200Today, I purchased a bed. Around $1400The mom and son who run this store are kind, and caring, without being stalkers. I am not comfortable with people breathing down my neck, but I don't want to be ignored either.The mom usually sticks to the desk, making phone calls and orders... and the son is the one who usually is walking the floor. Today, while looking for a bed, the son helped me with whatever I needed. Helping me make comparisons, and really had decent information.He let me lay on any bed I wanted to, pulled back the cover and gave me a memory foam pillow for my head.Once you pay their delivery fee, you never pay for it again. BONUS.The only bad things that we have experienced with them is that it took them a week to deposit my payment check.... it always makes me feel like a payment is lost.When my husband called and asked when our new bed was going to be delivered, the woman told him that we were "off the beaten path" for them..... Maybe I should remember that when I go furniture shopping next time.Went in today, 1/31/14.I had called and spoke with the "mother". I told her that there was a plastic part of my bed frame that had broke. She told me to just come in and pick one up.I went to the 3rd bedroom in my house, and saw that two were broken. I brought this up to the son, while the mom was on the phone. She over heard me ask for two, and kind of gave me the look of death."You said you only needed one."Well, sorry, before I drove the 26 miles to get here, I saw that there were two broken.
5	What a wonderful experience! Phyllis and her son (Mike?) were extremely friendly and very helpful. They let us browse for a while without ever getting pushy. When we had questions, they answered honestly and without regard to selling us the highest priced items. Their input and advice was also appreciated. As a result, we ended up buying an entire apartment's worth of furniture for our daughter, who just relocated to Vegas. And all items were delivered in a couple days. This will be our first, and probably last, stop for any further furniture needs.
1	Just moved into town and spent a couple days visiting various furniture stores. Came across this small family owned store and immediately found the exact couch and style I wanted for the exact price range i was looking for.The family that runs this place is super friendly and very knowledgeable about furniture. Although the showroom floor doesn't have as big of a selection as some other stores in town, they offer a bunch of catalogs to order from. Their one time delivery charge could be the only potential downside for this place. If you're in the market to buy multiple pieces of furniture like me, this one time charge is great as you do not have to pay it again to have any additional pieces you buy delivered. However, if you're only looking to purchase a specific item, the delivery charge is really high compared to other locations. Overall, great establishment!****UPDATE 2/28/2014****As you can see, my review for this place started off great but that has drastically changed. First - I purchased my couch last Saturday and was told to expect my delivery by the following Friday(today). I received a phone call attempting to schedule delivery next Tuesday in the afternoon and was a little bummed out as I was really hoping to have my new couch and finally be able to relax in my apartment during the weekend. I asked for an earlier delivery date but was advised that there unfortunately was not one available. I'm pretty reasonable and understood that there could have been multiple factors as to why the couch would not be available for delivery until this time and just accepted it. What happened next is what really got to me..Second - I began to proceed with scheduling delivery on the following Tuesday and had politely advised that I would not be home until the evening and requested that delivery be made after 5:30pm. The immediate response I got was that they did not deliver in the evenings. I was confused because one of the specific questions I asked when purchasing this couch was if they were able to accomodate deliveries after 6pm because of my schedule. Both the lady behind the desk and Mike(salesman) enthusiastically replied with "yes, of course! we offer time specific deliveries as late as 7pm and offer Saturday deliveries!" I clearly remember this conversation because that was one of the determining factors in purchasing my couch from this establishment as oppose to others. She agreed to schedule my delivery for 5:30pm but I now will have to request to leave work early to accomodate this delivery time as I get off work at 5pm and know that it takes half an hour to get home due to traffic.At first I was very pleased with this place but now just feel like the staff are your typical sales reps that will say anything to get you to give them your money. If I hadn't already paid for their 'one-time' delivery charge, which I am now skeptical about, I would definitely not be coming back to this place because of their poor business etiquette. IF anyone decides to do business here, I highly suggest getting everything relayed to you in writing.
1	I haven't even had this bed a year, & the frame on it broke.I went in to get replacement parts.By mistake, I said that I only needed 1 part instead of 2. Phyllis made her annoyance with me clear. "You said you only needed one."In a snarl that would have frightened a lion.Sorry.If the frame you had provided me stayed intact,I wouldn't have to make the drive of 30 miles to get here. The stitching on the bed has started to come loose, exposing the mattress material. There are also threads coming undone on the surface. I believe I spent about $1400 for this bed, I haven't even had it a year....there's no reason why it should be falling apart.3/6/14I contact them via FB with a picture. Their response-"Don't worry, this company has one of our best warranties. Let me look up your information and I will contact you shortly."They tell me that they are going to order me a new bed.They call me on the 12th to set up a time. We decided on the 15th, at 1030.3/15I get a call, **30**minutes before the delivery from Phyllis. Telling me that they never received my bed. That she has called the company over & over again with no answer. So.....Let me get this straight.In the 3 days that we haven't talked, you never got my replacement.You don't even let me know the night before. Unless you get early deliveries (on a Saturday) before you load up your truck, you STILL knew that you did NOT have my bed. I clear out my morning to wait around for your drivers, and  you don't even give me the common courtesy of more than 30minutes? -a few hours later-Phyllis tells me that they will have my mattress Tuesday.We set up a delivery for the 19th at noon.The truck arrives at 1215,and the guys need to "look" at my mattress before they give me my new one.The mattress itself has 2 stains on it, which one of the guys takes pictures of.. then stepped outside to call Phyllis.The picture snapper comes back inside and tells me that my mattress is no now longer under warranty.I guess stains have something to do with the stitching of my bed..?They don't give me my new mattress, and drive off.Let me be crystal clear.NO ONE from Furniture Markdowns told me that stains ***(or anything, for that matter) on my bed would VOID the warranty.**Also, I **NEVER** received warranty information on my mattress. Not on my receipt, not a booklet, not even a website on a napkin! Because if they did, I wouldn't have cleared 2days out of my life to try and get this fixed. I wouldn't have played phone tag with them for the last week.They claim to be a "family" business,but they are only going for what benefits THEIR family.I will NEVER EVER buy from this store ever again. *Response to owner's comment & Private message 3/27/14""This is Mike.  I first want to apologize, I never want to see one of our customers this upset.   When we spoke about your mattress I asked you if it was still clean and you said yes.  On your word we paid for a new mattress  (which is how this company works, we pay for the new mattress and they credit us when they get the damaged one back), had it delivered to us, and paid my gentleman to deliver and exchange out the mattress to you.  My delivery drivers know they have to check the mattress because our mattress companies will not take back any soiled mattress's.   The companies don't know what the soiling is and will not except them back at the factory with any stains.   It is the mattress companies policy and their warranty we have to follow.  It is the same with Serta, Simmons, Spiring Air and Sealy, all of which we have sold.  I am sorry for this, but again it's the manufacturers policy.  If there is something we can do please let us know.""***ONCE AGAIN. You never asked me if the mattress was stained. If you had asked me if it was STAINED, I would have told you.Multiple stains..? Uh, no. Two. See picture. It's posted on Yelp & FB. I've never hid that fact.If your drivers know to check for stains, maybe someone should have came out and checked my bed **before you ordered the replacement.Believe me, I have better things to do with my time then try & set up delivery for a bed that isn't replaceable.  I would have accepted the fact that the warranty was voided and went on with my life.I was **never given any paperwork or warranty information on this mattress.... Whether it's "standard" or not, handing out warranty information on the PRODUCTS THAT YOU SELL it's probably a good business practice.You bought a new mattress-that you can SELL-or send back..(?)In the last year, I've spent thousands at your store. I've bought this bed, and a couch.I'm sure you can afford to pay them when they were at my house for 7minutes.Unless you are going to replace my bed that is falling apart, please don't waste your time in contacting me anymore.THANKS.***********7/20/2014The frame on my bed has broke ONCE AGAIN.TWO TIMES IN THE LAST 10 MONTHS!JUNK. JUNK. JUNK!
5	I absolutely LOVE this store. I moved to Las Vegas in November 2013 and I've had such bad luck with furniture stores since I've been here.  I went to Furniture Markdowns to browse after an unpleasant experience and obtaining a refund from a big name furniture store.  In disgust I googled furniture stores and Furniture Markdowns was first on the list.  I drove the 13 miles and boy am I ever glad I did!  Momma & Mike were so helpful, I really like their personal customer service, not pushy at all, and Momma sat with me and mapped out my furniture placement.  I was told on Monday, my furniture would be here at 10:00 AM today, and it came on time and it looks beautiful.  I absolutely love Furniture Markdowns!!  I plan on going back there as I saw a couple of pieces that I'm interested in (and the lifetime delivery charge doesn't hurt either!)  I wish I could give Furniture Markdowns 100 stars, because in my book, they deserve it!
5	This place is hands down the go to place. I am reading reviews on the quality of their items and that makes no sense at all and here is why.We have been going to this place for over 10 years and hundreds of Las vegans do the same and for a reason. The way they work is you go look at the bog shops like Walker and RC Willey, and Ashley, and find what you like, take a photo and get the info on the tag and bring it to them and they will get it for less cause they skip the middle man and have lower overhead. Its that simple folks.NOTE:The people writing they got junk, well chances are they ordered the cheapest way available plain and simple. If you order a mattress they ill tell you do you want basic, better, best, or one of a kind, its Just like with every product, you get what you pay for and you can get bottom of the barrel or top quality, the beautiful part about them is you have a choice.They also have a beautiful showroom full of nice items to look. They also have hundreds of books to look through to find your perfect item. They can get you just about anything and for cheaper. We have been going to them for so long we don't even need to go to the big boxes and we just order from the mag and about a week later we get it.The business is owned by a family that cares and remembers the small details. If your looking for cheap made stuff they can get it to you for cheap, if your looking for quality, they will get it to you for the best price. All negative reviews need to understand how economics works and go to business school if they are going to slam this company. Shame on you!We are customers for life and are thankful we have a place like this in Las Vegas. You will not be disappointed with their service.
