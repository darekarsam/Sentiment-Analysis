5	One of the things in life I agonize over is taking my car to the shop.  I find that Purcell's takes most of the pain away.  I had a timing belt bust in my Daewoo (yes, I did say Daewoo - my image just sank a few points).  They honestly looked at the car, took it apart reassembled the engine and charged me a fair price.My other car is a Subaru Outback (an improvement over the Daewoo).  They provided me with a thorough analysis and did not charge me an arm and leg.A place you can trust.
5	When I got fed up taking my NITRO to a Dodge dealership service department, I chose Purcell.  Mainly because they are two blocks from where I live.Whether routine servicing or a major repair, I have found that I can trust the mechanics and repairs at Purcell's.  And I appreciate that they are national, should I every have a problem while on a trip.They are not the cheapest, but dependable work is more economical in the long run.  As well as peace of mind.  Their people are a pleasure to work with.  Really!I highly recommend the auto service team at Purcell's.
