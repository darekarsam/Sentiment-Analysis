5	This place was AWESOMENESS!.  They have so much stuff. You go into Equine shopping overload.  The gals were super nice and very helpful.  To helpful in the way they kept showing me super cool things that would be great for my horse.  They have things that I have never seen in stores or even Online stores.The only downfall with this place is they only carry high end English apparel.  But Oh my gosh! you could spend ours in there. And everything else is pretty reasonably priced.  Next time I am visiting again I will be stopping by.
1	They don't even deserve the one star!!! This place is a joke horrible customer service my mom hasn't got her name tag that she ordered over three weeks ago they keep telling her they're sending it over night but nothing has shown up,she has already paid for this item in advance. They told my mom that maybe she should just go in to pick it up when my mom lives 69 miles away and they're the ones messing up!! Buyers beware!!!!!!! As of today Friday she still hasn't received her item when they told her they were mailing it out on Monday! Get your crap together WC EQUESTRIAN we will never step foot in your awful store again and we will make sure to let everyone we know how you do business and how you run your store!!!
