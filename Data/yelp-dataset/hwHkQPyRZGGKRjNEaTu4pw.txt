4	This is a Taverne with video lottery terminals flashing in the back, cold mugs of beer for $3.50, a sweet live French folk band on the stage on a Friday hollaring for a happy full but not crowded house. Wooden tables, friendly if un-hurried service, free wifi. Just a room, you know, where people in a neighbourhood go when they want to dip but not drown their sorrows with a full age range of possible allies around them, steeped in a sense of place that's been there doing just exactly that for decades.
