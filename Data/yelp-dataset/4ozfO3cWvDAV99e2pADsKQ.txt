4	I was driving around while on break and saw the store.  I just recently got into crocheting and those inside were very helpful.  The store has beautifully crocheted and knitted items spread around the display area near different types of yarn.  They have classes and I enjoyed conversing with both them and the customers who came in the store.  Very cute labels and awesome people.  Can't wait to attend knit night on Tuesday!
4	Went to this place when I was in Charlotte for the weekend. This place is really cool. I little hard to find - it's in the back of a strip mall - and I went in the wrong door. They have a small area for classes and that's the door I ended up going through. Overall a very nice shop. The staff were friendly but not pushy and they have a great selection of yarns and accessories. Very well organized, which is nice when you are browsing.
3	Great shop, not all of their employees are the friendliest, but the owner Patty and her mom Nancy are fantastic. Sometimes open knitting can get a bit crowded so if you go, get there early. And while they don't always have enough to do a sweater or a large project on hand, if you ask they can order it for you in the color that you need.
5	Stumbled upon this shop doing the Yarn Crawl 2014.  This is a fantastic yarn shop with great prices!  All of their employees were super nice, helpful and friendly!  It is a little challenging to find the store, but worth checking out!
