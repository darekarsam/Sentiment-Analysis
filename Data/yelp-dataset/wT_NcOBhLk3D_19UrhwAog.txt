2	Whose moronic idea was it to put a Sainsburys where Peckhams used to be??? Not only is there a (larger) Tesco a block away, there is a proper sized Waitrose about 10 to 15 minutes down the road. Ok, they probably paid a lot of money to someone to do the market research and found that there's enough of a market to warrant opening another grocery store. Fine. But if that's the case, it needs to have a schtick. It needs to cater towards, say, the lunch and ready made meal crowd. Instead, this incredibly tiny Sainsburys thinks it's a proper sized store and stocks all types of items. As a result, it seems to have absolutely nothing reasonable.So booooooooooo to this Sainsburys.  Bring back something with soul, or at least something that stocks more than 20% of my shopping list.
2	Oh yay.... (Sarcasm)I second Emily on this one. It is obvious why there were many community meetings and petitions against the opening of this Sainsburys. I'd like to say that I signed the petition. This grocery store brings nothing to the neighbourhood. It is small and cramped, stocks a little of everything and has nothing special about it. Yes.. its clean, but I'd much prefer to have a guy who sells only vegetables in this area. (Has anyone noticed how far we have to walk to get a few non-prepackaged veges?)All in all, it's a shame the big supermarket has won this one. Lets just hope that we don't get any other big name in the Bruntsfield area anytime soon.
