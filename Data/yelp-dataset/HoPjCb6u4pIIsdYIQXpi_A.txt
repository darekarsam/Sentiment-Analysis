4	Not much different than any other Jamba Juice, except that they don't take gift cards (permanently). An employee there told me they are not a part of the franchise, so check to see if they are participating in the same promotions if you're going just for that.
1	Awful.  The McDonald's of smoothie chains.  The smoothies are terrible. I have no idea how places that continually serve a substandard product get popular.  I can only assume that it is marketing.  I know that a lot of Chicago kids like Jamba Juice because that is all they have ever heard of, but yuck is yuck and boring is boring.  I didn't try one smoothie and quit.  I tried several times to give the place a chance. Terrible. It's only saving grace is the carrot juice.
5	Best. Smoothies. EVER. More places should have them!! I highly recommend the razzmatazz smoothie it is a nice blend of berries and citrus fruits! I wish it was located more conveniently it is located on campus which is good for students just not everyone else but the smoothies are worth it!
