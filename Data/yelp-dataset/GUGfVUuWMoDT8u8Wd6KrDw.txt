5	Love this location and l love Nancy the gal that cuts my hair. Nothing bad to say at all. Plus with the check in app, it reduces your wait time. And for $13 bucks a cut- you can't beat it!
4	"Name speaks for itself"Friendly service. Efficient. Haven't had a bad cut yet.  Very family friendly.  Stylist are conversant, but not overly.  Check-in app is useful.  I've had my cut by 4 different stylist and I've been happy.  Nancy is probably the most popular stylist there.  She is the manager and her stylist like her.  Good management, good stylist, efficient, clean equals Great Clips (at least at this location). Find this useful, funny, or cool please check below.
5	Checked in online and was in and out in under half an hour. Location was clean and my stylist, Tasha, was great. Conversational and adept at what she does - she knew exactly what I was looking for and completed it efficiently.
5	Was at my boyfriend's house and really just wanted some extra pampering. Decided that I was going to try one of those blow dry places. He suggested going here because he'd been here a few times for haircuts. Tasha was fantastic! She welcomed me as soon as I stepped into the shop. I have long hair & she did a great job!  She took time to put extra conditioner in my hair and chatted with me about life. All in all, a totally pleasant experience that I might do again soon. Two thumbs up! Thanks for a great experience
5	Outstanding service!  All of stylists were very friendly and the fresh haircut is amazing, exactly what I requested.
