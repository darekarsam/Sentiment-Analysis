5	Best customer service I've had in years!!! left with a crazy deal on phones and took care of all my questions. There is no one else better.
5	I have been with Verizon for years and been in several other stores as well as dealt with Verizon on line customer service but have never received the service I did here!I went in to add my son back to our family plan wanting to change my cell phone from iPhone 5 to either the new larger screen iPhone or back to the galaxy note.The salesman really took his time walking me through the options of both phones and helped me make the decision easy to move to the new Galaxy note. He also helped me find a great deal on a tablet for my son for Christmas!Finally he looked at my plan and told me I could save money moving to a different package for my data and got me additional gig of data to my plan for less!As I watched his team work with other customers I realized I will not work with the online team anymore I will go into this store for all my needs! They really cared about the customers and were a ton of fun making the time fly by as we waited to complete our transactions!Thank you so much for your professionalism and EXCELLENT customer service!Stephanie Burden
