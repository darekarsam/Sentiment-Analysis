4	Totally, utterly and completely a fan.  Van and I needed furniture, so of course we scoped Ikea and Good Will and then wanted to check out this place.  Bill is awesome, clad in a cowboy hat, cowboy shirt and jeans he is definitely a discerning eye for style.  His store is PACKED with furniture; everything from couches, chairs, chests, to stuffed animals, (literally- taxidermy style) and cowboy boots. So much awesome in one place.  I literally didn't know where to look first.  It's a bit of a challenge to find things, since the store does not seem organized, also nothing is priced.  But we found a chest that we could not live without and were flabbergasted at the price, (in a good way.)  We both literally thought that it would be $100 more.  Pittsburgh definitely had some amazing retro and vintage finds.  Anyways, we will DEFINITELY come back to Bill, he was incredibly helpful, polite and friendly.  Loved it!
4	I had to dock a star because nothing is priced. I hate asking how much things are, I feel as though prices may change depending if they're having a good week vs. A bad one, the price may fluctuate...Im not saying that's the case here but that's the problem...you just don't know.On to tthe review... It looks like goodwilll threw up inside but I promise you this place is full of great items. Im on a quest to find a couple big bookcases (not from ikea) and a painting to go over the fireplace. I didn't find either the day I went but I did fiind some other goodies.Bill informed me that good, solid bookcases were rare to find...everything is particle wood these days... I'll keep my eye out. Bill is super friendly, eager to help and not pushy...all qualities I love in a salesman.P.S. cash or check only!
5	Yelp is showing this place as being in the North Hills but it's actually located in Homestead: 135 E 8th Ave!!
