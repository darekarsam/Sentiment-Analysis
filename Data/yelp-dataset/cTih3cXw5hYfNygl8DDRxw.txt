4	Good kosher food is hard to find in Canada. It's near impossible in Toronto, let alone Ontario.I've found one can find good Kosher food in Ottawa, but Montreal is a whole different ball game.Last time I was at Chez Benny was about 6 years ago and I'm still thinking about their Shawarma in a Laffa. I couldn't finish it and I sure as hell wanted to. Mind you, I did have a fantastic lunch for the next day. I'd put it on par with Doctor Laffa in Toronto. But it is delightful to know that there is a great option the next time I travel to Montreal (which I am severely due for).It seems from their website that they have upgraded since I have been there. Can't wait to go again!
5	If you looking for great kosher restaurant in montreal, chez Benny is the place to go. Although they recently moved to a new location, you don't need a car to take you to the new place. It's just a few shops away from the old place. The shawarma, shish-taouk, is great. The staff are mostly busy with customers and orders but they still do a good job. I'm sure if you grab a bite here. You'll be wanting more........(food).
2	Good food but extremely SLOW in receiving your order. I usually go there and also order delivery/take out and in both cases they're not efficient in delivering an "express" service as their name has been advertised. Gotta find a way to standup as a "fast"food restaurant.
