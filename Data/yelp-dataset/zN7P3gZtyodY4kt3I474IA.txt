2	I stop here from time to time on my way home from work when I'm too lazy to make supper.  What can I say it's fast food greek, I usually get the souvlaki stick platter.  I find this place tends to charge good resto prices for take out quality.  I've had much better, but it does the trick when I'm stuck.Never underestimate laziness LOL
3	I like hitting Arahova every once in awhile for that Greek bad breath kick in the teeth. This location has changed much over the last year or so. Previously, what it offered was at BEST mediocre food that lacked substance, the ingredients were suspect and the service was bad.But over the last year or so, they came out with a new menu, the service is decent and the food is much better overall. Not perfect though.My personal favorite is the Gyro "a l'ancienne". The tzatziki is very food and the ingredients are fresh. The fries are good and the salad is an odd combination of tomatoes and onions with some feta.The price tag is a bit much for what it is worth if you stray from their combo menu and even that it pales to compare to some other Greek places of repute in Montreal.I like visiting their place due to a severe lack of Greek goodness in this area but honestly when I can go for an extended lunch I much rather prefer to drive up to Sources to eat at Marathons.
