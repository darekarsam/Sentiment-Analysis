5	Great job by AZ. He has done portraits of my family members. They look great. Details pop out. Currently working on my Japanese sleeve. If you want a great tattoo. He's your guy!!
5	Definitely the best tattoo shop in the state, maybe in the whole west coast. All the artists there have some amazing talent which can be seen in every piece of work that comes out of that shop. I have been to and had work done at many many shops all over the US and after getting work done at Purgatory, I certainly will not go anywhere else. Zander Arizona (aka Az) is the most talented tattoo artist I have ever seen. I will never get tattooed by someone other than him for the rest of my life! (Also I live in Alaska and will make the trip all the way down to Arizona just to get work done by him!) He does portraits that look like he photocopied the picture right into the skin!! He is truly amazing! I highly recommend anyone to come in and check him and everyone else at the shop out. I am guaranteed you will be amazed!
5	Clean, professional & talented. This goes for both the establishment and the artists. What else could you ask for in a tat shop?! I had a great experience here and will def be back to finish up more work.
