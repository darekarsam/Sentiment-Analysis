5	We have had A LOT of framing done over the years at various frame shops.  Hands down, this is the best frame shop in the Madison area!!  Paul, the owner, is one of the nicest people you will ever meet.  His work is excellent and prices are incredibly reasonable.  Also, he completes the projects fast.  He has finished most of our projects in 7 - 10 days.  The last frame shop we used averaged about 90 days.

The turn around was extremely quick and the prices were equally good. Sometimes it's the little things that bring you back, and Douglas Art and Frame did that as well. I can't say enough good things about this place.
