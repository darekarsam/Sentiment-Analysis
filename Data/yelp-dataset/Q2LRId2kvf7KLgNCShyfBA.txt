3	Welcome to the other How Lee in town. Nestled in Edgewood Town Center this is place serves Americanized chinese food.  It isn't great but it isn't awful and it works in a pinch for takeout. The prices are very reasonable but I have to admit that I am terrified of the woman that answers the phone. She is very gruff to say the least.
1	Shame on me for not double checking my take out order before leaving, but they left two items out of the bag. At first I thought that it was an honest mistake, but when I called to explain what happened they said they were sorry and there was nothing that they could do.It could have been a language barrier issue but I think they knew what happened and just decided not to offer to deliver the items that they left out and not refund the missed items. Finally, the food was significantly worse than the How Lee in Squirrel Hill and next time I will simply drive the extra two miles to get better food.
2	This place is OK but not great. I wonder if they don't develop convenient amnesia when packing up the orders. My order was missing the wonton soup that I paid for.  But, I'm not going to quibble with the mean Chinese lady over $2.
3	Yes, very Americanized Chinese food, but reasonably priced and with great service. They seem to do mostly takeout service, however the dining room is clean, spacious and inviting. Big portion sizes and delicious. This place is a great option in favor of fast food.
