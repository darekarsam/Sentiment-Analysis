1	Ms jean catered my wedding last week.... It was a disaster . She breach the contract by not having the linens ready for the tables at 9am for my 3pm reception ..... Food was not served at 3pm..... Had my guest setting the table.... That was her staffs job to do.... I paid for my guest to have two meats they only received one...... She was rude to my husband.... My dad .... And other guest.....  I told her I have two grandmas that are diabetics and had to be severed with the bridal party.. They weren't ... We paid for 100 guest to eat only 67 showed up.... There was extra food left over.... She took the food with her .... The day before the wedding she explained to me that the guest could have the rest of the food but the bride would have first choice.... I understand there was a death in the family but if you couldn't do the job right you should have had someone fill in..... Oh and the caters were eating in front of my guest during the reception....(ghetto)... And the utensils while serving ... Was an ice cream scooper to serve macaroni and cheese at a wedding ) (ghetto )... I will never do business again with ms jean. Lost me as a customer... Hosanna House never recommend her services again. My guest did say the food was good..... But it was over topped by the rude service ...... And don't pass out business cards to my guest and you were rude to them.... All they did was throw them away.
1	Jean cater my wedding reception she was on time the food tasted good.But I didn't get everything that I ask for is for a set up  and she had a nasty attitude she didn't work well with other people.And her staff help themselves to my food and they was drinking alcohol at my wedding. The was terrible it was worth the money l spent.she's a terrible business person.She ever answer my letter and didn't call me back.LaSawn Wilkerson
