4	Decent place, friendly cashier up front. Have not tried the pharmacy - happy with another chain. But came here to get what I've needed :)
1	The pharmacy at this store is AWfUL! They have lost several prescriptions. I asked them to put something on automatic refill and they never have it ready. They do not know what they are talking about and are extremely rude and unhelpful. Save yourself the time and go somewhere else....
3	It's not cheap, but it's convenient. I just needed one pharmacy item and they had a good selection of them. Easy. And with my member shopping card thingie, I saved about ten percent.The store is clean and well organized and I like that the floor isn't boring tiles but is a nice high-gloss fake wood style.Easy.
