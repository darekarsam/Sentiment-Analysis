3	Not a big fan of Maxi in general nor this specific one. Prices are good but quality and selection is on the low end. It seems sometimes there even out of the basic stuff.The place is conveniently located near the highway and the Champlain bridge and has a large parking lot. There is a gaz station attached with prices generally on the low end compared to others and they give a discount on your receipt applicable to purchases at Maxi.
