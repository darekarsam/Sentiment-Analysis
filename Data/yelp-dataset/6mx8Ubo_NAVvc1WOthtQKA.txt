3	I was on my way to ride my bike and hike near Lake Mead and I decided to do a little detour and have breakfast on Water Street in Henderson.  I daresay I haven't been on the street in 40 plus years.  The place I had bookmarked was closed so I walked across the street to the Eldorado Casino--owned by the Boyd Group--to have breakfast there.Mary's Diner is a 50s kind of place with lots of memorabilia from the era.  This is so off the beaten path that I think all of the customers were locals.  This is not a destination casino.I ordered the chili and cheese omelette.  It comes with breakfast potatoes and toast.  It was very good and very filling.  My server was Stacey and she was a delight!  While eating, I enjoyed the music of that era playing on the loudspeakers.  I couldn't help but hum the tunes.  The music of my younger days!This was a good breakfast spot.
