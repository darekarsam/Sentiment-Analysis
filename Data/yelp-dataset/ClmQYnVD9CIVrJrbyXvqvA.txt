4	Spacious, clean and friendly service. Came in to check out some Christmas decorations And they had some nice ones here. They also had wrapping paper and gift bags for a good price. Wouldn't come here for furniture or appliances, it's about the same price if not higher than Walmart or target.Great parking, quiet area and good savings on most things!;)
4	So, I was house sitting this past weekend and was up in the neighborhood looking for ways to kill time. Big lots filled that void perfectly. Not only was I able to see some scary plush pillows, I scored big-time on coconut water: $1.50 for a liter!! If I want to assemble an emergency preparedness kit, I'm one step closer now that I have a hand crank radio. And this store is next to a smoke shop that sells bacon flavored vapor.The store was also very well organized and there weren't many other shoppers. The staff were friendly enough, but most of the stockers appeared to be engrossed in phone conversations. However, my checker hooked me up with a rewards card. Saweet!!
