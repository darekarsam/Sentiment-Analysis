5	Love this place.  Had a fill done and they fixed the shabby job that the previously place I had my nails done.  Was debating about getting a gel polish, but when I saw that they are able to do a french manicure, I went for it.  My nails look fabulous.  They moved from a smaller shop on the other end of the strip. The new place is much larger and really beautiful. I used to go here a few years ago, but due to circumstances had to stop. My daughter brought me to her place and surprised me with a full set and pedi. Big mistake. The guy just rushed thru my nails and pedi.  Went back to Sunflower for my fill and I could not be happier. Cory did my nails and as usual did a fantastic job. No matter where I move to in the valley, I will always travel to Sunflower Nails.
5	This place is excellent! I really like the entire experience, from the massage chairs to the nail art. They even have a booklet that you can look through to select pretty designs for fingers & toes. The plan is to return
