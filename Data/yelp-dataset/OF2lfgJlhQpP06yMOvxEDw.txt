5	I love this office. This is my second experience with physical therapy and this ha been an entirely positive experience.My therapist, Bill (he is a PT), is incredibly knowledgable and kind while making sure he gets the most out of you while you're in the office. He also equips you with the knowledge to work on whatever your problem area is once your therapy has ended.
