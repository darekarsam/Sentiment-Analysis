5	This was a wonderful yoga studio that I dropped in while on a business trip.  Larger sized class with plenty of props available.  More of a restorative yoga with slow stretching movements - I felt very relaxed, strong and centered after the practice. The studio is a little hidden with only a small sign outside. It's on the third flour and there is parking across the street. It was cool in the studio so grab a blanket for shivasana or wear warmer practice wear (in winter at least). Wonderful drop in rate with really cute shirts for sale.   Highly recommend.
5	This is hands-down THE place to enjoy yoga as it should be enjoyed in the Pittsburgh area.  The owners of this studio have not compromised an inch of their integrity in finding a way to build a business around bringing yoga to people.  The instructors and classes are consistently stellar.
5	They have a beautiful, big studio and great teachers. I LOVE their annual New Year Renewed event, and I plan my holiday visit home to Pittsburgh around it so I can go.
