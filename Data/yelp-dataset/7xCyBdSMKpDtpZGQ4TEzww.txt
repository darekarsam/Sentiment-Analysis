5	I recommend them highly!!  I took my 2 year old daughter for a sleep study and was very impressed.  Our sleep technician was amazing with her, very patient and kind.  The DVD we brought to watch while getting her hooked up got stuck in the TV and they vowed to return it.  We got a call the next day checking on our daughter and saying how sweet she was, they mentioned the DVD.  Several days later, we received the DVD plus a new copy of the Lion King with a nice note.  They are very good at what they do and if they can make a 2 year old feel at ease, they can probably do the same with anyone!!
5	If you need to have a sleep study done this is the place to have it done. With 5 sleep centers throughout the valley there was a sleep center not far from where we were staying. The facility is absolutely beautiful.The rooms are like a resort with the staff as nice as can be and very knowledgeable.  My daughter had the best experience here.
5	Great staff, they make you feel so at home. Every medical facility should be this nice. Felt like a nice hotel. Someone has great taste in decorating. Thanks for making us feel at home.
5	I had a sleep study recently and had a great experience with Valley Sleep Center.  It was clean and a nice environment and the employees were helpful.  I received a bill for more than I expected when I got home and when I called, they corrected it to what I was quoted and sent out a corrected statement right away.  I was expecting grief and was pleasantly surprised!  :-)
