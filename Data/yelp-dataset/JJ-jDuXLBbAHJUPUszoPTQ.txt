1	I've been a B of A customer for 12 years and I've never had any problems until visiting this branch.  Twice now they have made mistakes on deposits and today they deposited money into the wrong account.  When I went back to the teller she reversed the transaction and then proceeded to deposit the money in the wrong account again.  I felt bad that I had to ask her to tell me again which account she was depositing into but I didn't want to take any chances.  In 12 years this is also the only branch I've caught the tellers making a mistake on the deposit amount.  I would advise anyone going into the branch to double and triple check the data entry and accounts the tellers are handling.
5	I've had the exact opposite experience at this branch as previously described by the other individual. Had my general banking needs can be taken care of without issue.I'm guessing something might have changed in the past year.
5	Convenient Location, right by the mall & surrounding restaurants. I've personally never had any problems here. Oh, and hands down the best looking building in Mesa.I like the multiple drive-thru ATM's. If you have to go inside (who does that anymore??) parking may be an issue but I think there's a parking garage adjacent to the building with additional room. Don't know, since I've never had to utilize it.
2	Went on a Friday afternoon and waited 45 minutes in line with 1 cashier working.  Someone was being trained behind the counter and the trainer was very rude when approached by multiple customers about opening another window.  The only reason why I'm even giving 2 stars is because the woman who actually helped was extremely helpful and kind.
