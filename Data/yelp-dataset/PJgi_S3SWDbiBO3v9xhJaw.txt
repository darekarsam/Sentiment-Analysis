5	I'm a mexican food nut and this place was recommended to me by a Latino friend.   The fajitas are incredible, chips, salsa and guac are homemade - everything is fresh and authentic.   Having the live mariachi singers only adds to the atmosphere.   Services was good, prices were fair, no complaints.
5	What an incredible find. Awesome pazole and chorizo and eggs. Great service, wonderful atmosphere, air-conditioned Nicely.
4	Went there on a slow Sunday with some hiking buddies.  The place is more appealing inside.  Nice warm atmosphere that can accommodate larger groups.  The menu has plenty of choices and the food is good though not excellent  I had the California Burrito which is vegetarian but I also added chicken. Complimentary salsa and chips.  Beer and wine only and those are limited in choices. Pleasant service.   OVerall a good experience.  I will be back.
3	I ordered a drink that I stumbled upon at another restaurant by accidentally mixing horchata and Jamaica and I really like this drink.   I ordered it at this restaurant and the server, who was Diana made faces at me and asked if I was sure that was what I wanted and I said yes, that's what I asked for.   Then when she brought my drink she told my friend that speaks Spanish that she has never made a drink like that and laughed about it.  Her attitude completely ruined my experience.  I couldn't even enjoy my food (which was good) because of her facial expressions and remarks.  And I must say, that she shouldn't speak in Spanish to my friend and belittle me.  Have the nerve to say it to me in English, so I can defend myself.
