2	Hi all,I just went there yesterday for a late supper after 8pm on Wednesday (obviously not during the rush) after a lot of positive reviews from friends. And what a deception !Bread was good but cold...We actually had to wait over 45 min for the first plate.Every dishes had no balance (I couldn't taste my duck covered by the leek), everything was very very salty (I got 4-5 glass of water with my wine).Overall, a very poor experience for a $40+ per person supper with a lot of expectations deceived, although waiters seems welcoming.Definetly not recommended.
