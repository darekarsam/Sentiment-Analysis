1	This review began in my mind about 10 days ago. I picked up my little shirt collection and all seemed well. Price was OK. Then, tonight, I unpacked one of my shirts to wear to dinner.The sleeve is almost completely torn off and pinned with two safety pins. I guess they figured I would just assume that it was an updated fashion statement. They probably didn't mention it because they couldn't handle my explosion of gratitude.
1	I took my curtains in to be dry cleaned and I didn't put them up until yesterday I had it done the first of August. Well, to make a long story short I had water stains on 2 panels, these were not cheap curtains. I will never, never take anything to them again.
5	We've been customers here for over eight years and I can't imagine going anywhere else.   Philip and his team do an excellent job with our clothing and the service is personalized and top-rate.  This is a classic neighborhood business with a small-town feeling and it's a pleasure to drop off or pick up.  If you need a special touch on something or another, just ask and they will make it happen.  Out of all the businesses I use on a regular basis, this is definitely one of the best.
