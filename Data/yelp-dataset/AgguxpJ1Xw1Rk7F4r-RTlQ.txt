5	If you like dunkin donuts, this location will do. Who doesn't love Dunkin! The location unfortunately has a difficult parking lot.
2	You guys know I love me some Dunkin Donuts Coffee.  SO the product is solid.  The service at this location....eh.   So I buy a travel mug (From this location) a few weeks back.  It overflows when you screw the lid on.  So don't fill it up so high right?  Well I explain this e-v-e-r-y-t-I-m-e I drive through...."it overflows easily so leave room".  So yesterday I tell the lady that and she hands me the coffee as it is spliing from the sides all over my car and me....oh and she's got tons of napkins too.  She says "you need a new mug".  I said, "no the mug is fine, you need to listen and not fill it up so much.."  She said, no you need a new mug.  Fortunately, idiots of the world don't bother me, I just move on and Yelp about them.  :)
1	I usually wouldn't make fun of retards but the people this place hires are total retards . Have no idea what they are doing. Run out of buns for sandwiches ? Really ? Total shit hole I can't wait til  this place disappears again.
