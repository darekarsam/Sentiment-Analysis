5	Great flowers and people. The store is very nice as well. I decided to get my wife flowers celebrating her promotion on my way to work and a beautiful arrangement was put together in no time. Thank you for a great job.
5	I love this place! I've gotten flowers here probably eight times in the last year and every time I'm so pleased with them. You can go in and tell them what you want and a price range and it takes about 15 minutes for them to whip you something up. The flowers last such a long time. In fact, the ones I have now I've had almost two weeks and they aren't even starting to die yet. This place is a gem!
