5	This is my local Harris Teeter and I come for donuts every Saturday. Great staff and everything I need to sustain life... including donuts!
1	Cauliflower $4.49 a head, really??? Fresh Chicken breast $10 - $11 for 3 breasts (1.5 lb), really?.....With the recent New Year 30 Day Paleo Challenge all over social media, it appears Harris Teeter, Prosperity Church Rd means to cash in and gouge it's loyal customers, by raising prices on products commonly used by customers trying to lose weight. Aldi, across the street, is selling cauliflower for $2.00/ head and managing to reap a decent profit without gouging their customers. We ALL have to eat....what other products are you attempting to gouge the public on.  My family spends over $15,000 / year on groceries. I have added one more resolution to my list...to make sure Harris Teeter gets very little of that!!! Good way to drive away customers!!
