1	This company is in the business of ripping off customers and if your a senior you better watch out. Due to a class action lawsuit in my community I had to let Delta Mechanical (the only company choosen to do work named in the lawsuit) to re-pipe my home. Upon them walking my home the informed me the cost was going to be a additional $900 above the allowable amount in the lawsuit.  I agreed to pay the additional amount. Upon ripping my walls to shreads for 3 days they infom me that they need to tear out my kitchen tile and concrete to put pipes to the kitchen sink or put in smaller pipe to which I would not be able to use my kitchen sink and dishwasher at the sametime.  They wanted an additonal amount of money and not going to replace the tile.  Upon contacting the city inspector they are attemping to do the job incorrectly and are not going to complete the job until I pay more.  They under bid the job they need to make it right.  I now have a non working kitchen and not resolution in sight. Beware of this company.
1	They are offering full water filtration system installation.The installation includes drilling a hole in countertop, wood, granite and all the others. But apparently they don't do the drilling because they don't.Thinking that installation of the fauset should be included in the installation of the water filtration system but apparently for them it's not,  so before you call them make sure that you have the hole for the fauset drilled already otherwise don't bother because they will not do it for you.
