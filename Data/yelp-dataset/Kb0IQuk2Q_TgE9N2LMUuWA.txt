2	i love, love, love ice cream, but this place just didn't do it for me.  I had the almond caramel ice cream, and it was bitter and not creamy enough.  It also was not at all sweet.My husband had the s'mores ice cream, which was a bit more palatable.  The marshmallows are house made, and are sooo good.  However, again, the ice cream just did not have a good flavor.I dunno, maybe that's their style around those parts as far as ice cream goes, but I am not a fan
5	Fresh Vanilla and Cassis soft-serve swirl. The perfect pick me up after a long day of walking up and down the streets of Montreal.
5	A really great artisan's ice cream place! They do everything in house here (the ice cream, the essences, the cones, the toppings, EVERYTHING) and with top quality ingredients... and it taste!Got an awesome cup with matcha tea and pistachio flavours. The service is personal and awesome, place is cool. Come experience it!
4	Soft-serve rhubarb frozen yogurt. I feel this all I need to say. Go.
5	They make everything in house- the cones, marshmallows, sorbet, and ice cream. It was all so amazing and flavorful. The sorbet was light-yet decadent at the same time. The strawberry-rhubarb soft serve ice cream was divine!!! This place is a gem and not to be missed.
4	I was walking along St-Denis and saw this place and couldn't help but pull in for a scoop in a cone. I got what I thought would be gingerbread flavour, but it turned out it was ginger flavour. This sounds like a recipe for failure but it was actually really delicious! It is also a flavour I have never seen offered before which always impresses me. They had a good selection of flavours here and you could tell the ice cream was made in-house.
4	After peeking in once and then passing this place by, I stopped in again one evening when I was on a mission for some ice cream. There were so many things to choose from that looked delicious on the menu. I probably changed my mind 10 times about what to order while the only person working there was busily preparing a backlog of orders for other customers. I saw her preparing delicious tastings for two that include profiteroles, mini ice cream sundaes, and a s'mores 'camp fire.' It looked delicious and thought I wanted to order this to share, though by the time the clerk was ready to assist us and a lined had formed behind, I decided just to go with a sundae. Looking back, I wish I had gone for the tasting menu to I could sample several things at once, particularly because though the sundae glass looked fairly big, it turns out that the base is made of fairly thick glass and does not hold much ice cream. That being said, the sundae was pretty good. But, considering that it was $7 for one sundae, I would've rather just paid double to try the tasting for two.
4	After trusting the hours posted on Yelp, thinking the place closed at 11pm, when they really closed at 10pm in December! Got to the store at 10:06 but they had already closed! So decided to come back the next day!Boy, was it worth it! Had to dessert tasting for two, incredible! Came here on dec 29th as they were closing in January, they only have limited ice cream & sorbets remaining! Definitely worth a visit! Esp on a hot summer day! Their ice creams were nice and creamy and sooooo yummy! Wish I cud try more flavours! Most memorable was the banana chocolate one don't remember the name! As our dessert for 2 enabled us 6 flavours and they had only 8 flavours left; vanilla,mango sorbet,passion fruit sorbet, banana, some chocolatey ones, maple syrup and another I can't remember! Definitely recommend this place which is all homemade ice cream! They also make their own marshmallows! I noticed they have some cakes as well, didn't get a chance to try! But hope I get to visit Montreal in the summer so I cud try their ice cream cookie sandwiches!!
4	i haven't visit the shop yet but i've been sampling their ice cream and sorbet at the IGA near plaza st.hubertso far, i've tried marshmallow camp fire, rhubarb sorbet, vanilla caramel ice cream and orange sorbet. all are good but the rhubarb sorbet is on a whole other levelcan't wait for them to re-open at the end of february so i can sample their other offerings
5	Got a chocolate and pistachio de maison and it was absolutely wonderful! I really liked the pistachio one, it was luxuriously creamy and had finely ground pieces of pistachios mmm. Plus, it was perfect for spring (no melts!).
5	Excellent gelato! A delicous way to end our night on St-Denis. Definitely recommend trying it out!Creamy gelato with some tasty cakes as well.
5	Last minute lookup on yelp for a good ice cream parlor.  This is a gem!!  It warrants. My first yelp review!Their ice creams & sorbets are delicious!  Add in a friendly smile (esp. To us English speakers), patient & fast service, samples before choosing, & the perfect ice cream menu, this place will be hard to beat. Two adults & child shared the sampler of:Republic of Banana**Campfire***Apple PieChocolatePistachio**Pear Vanilla Sorbet***They were all great. The started ones got top votes by the three of us, and the favorites were Campfire & Pear Vanilla.  It was a hard choice, but we took home a pint of Campfire!I will have to say that they have the best pistachio ice cream or dessert I have ever had; by a landslide!
5	Wow! Les Givres is L'mazing!  We did the tornee which is a flight of single scoops of six different flavors (your choice) each served in its own little ice cream shot glass. We did: melon, rhubarb, dark chocolate, carrot, blueberry, and banana republic. All were spectacular. They were closing as we got there but I honestly wanted to stay and taste every single flavor. We actually sampled a 7th flavor (for free) which was described to us as "grapefruit and beer" a totally odd combination but uniquely refreshing (and you could really taste both flavors). If i lived in Montreal I would be back weekly, and will be sure to stop by whenever I come back. I hope i can find an ice cream shop in nyc this good (though it'd probably be at least double the price). If food network made a special episode of the best things that "I" ever ate, I'm pretty sure this would make the list. YUMMY!
