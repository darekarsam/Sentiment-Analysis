3	We came here today with some friends who live in the area. They described it as something like Atlanta Bread Company. Yeah, that's pretty much it. End of review! :-)This is an up and coming franchise joint, doing the suburban strip mall thing. Inside they have a hunting lodge feel. Big fireplace, etc. The menu is pretty simple, with grilled sandwiches on fancy bread, salads, etc. I had a jerk chicken sandwich. I didn't taste much jerk on it, but there was so much going on with this thing, it had some flavor elsewhere. Otherwise I would say the sandwiches are forgettable. I just don't see anything different or unique about this place that you can't get at a dozen other restaurant concepts.
4	I think Bear Rock gets lost among the shuffle of other sandwich restaurants like Subway and Quiznos. It might be a little more expensive then other sandwich shops but the ingredients are always very fresh and there are a lot of options on the menu. Soups, sandwiches, salads, baked potatoes and pizzetas are all over the menu. There are also a variety of combinations to chose from. I personally really like the Moose, Rising Sunflowers, Rockslide, and Bear Cristo. The honey mustard that comes on each sandwich is really good and a nice change from mustard and mayonnaise. I would give Bear Rock a shot if you've never tried it.
4	Bear Rock is a nice restaurant, with unique sandwich. I recommend the fireside jerk sandwich. It's a grilled chicken sandwich with jerk seasoning, banana peppers, and a special sweet sauce. It's great! That sandwich alone is worth a visit
