3	With a wide selection of fine cigars and smoking accessories (whatever that means) it's a great place for the cigar smoker in your life.  I myself don't have my experience on the topic, but from what I know this place is pretty good.  Like most cigar places this is kind of a boys club, but I did see some women while I was there.  So if you know cigar smokers this is the perfect place to find gifts.
5	Great selection, knowledgeable staff, and a smoking room to boot.  This place the perfect cigar store.  All the tinder box stores are gems.  Better than any other cigar store in the Charlotte area.  You can find cigars here that you can't find anywhere else.
3	The staff here is quite knowledgeable and they have a fairly decent selection of cigars. However, I have been talked down to because of my age, which is an immediate turn off. The lounge is nice, but small and doesn't have any TVs or music. Overall, I would come back in search of a certain cigar, but it's nothing to write home about.
5	Great selection of cigars! It is bar far the best tinder box in the Charlotte! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and is always extreamily helpful! When you walk in you are always welcomed and the layout os great.    They also have a small smoking lounge in the back which is always nice! This is my go to cigar shop in Charlotte!
