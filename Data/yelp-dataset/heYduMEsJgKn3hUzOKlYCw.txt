5	JF Landscaping does an excellent job with our lawn services. They are always prompt in coming on their scheduled weeks and did a very excellent job. Jose Fuentes is the owner of JF Landscaping and he is very prompt in replying to you via email when you contact him regarding any questions or concern. I first learned about them through a few of my neighbors that use him also. I definitely recommend his service to anyone any day if you want excellent lawn care.
1	Not a great job and mows with guards up.  Damaged my car and then denied it and started cussing.  Unprofessional and Rude and not very good landscape service.  I to wish they had a 0 star.
