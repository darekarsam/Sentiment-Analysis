5	Unique one of a kind pieces! Great for gifts for girlfriends!
5	I absolutely love this store! I popped in right when they first moved in and realized I had been in the store several years back and loved it!!  Artiques was previously on Charleston near Whole Foods and relocated to Boca Park near Kona Grill (smart move too!!)  I recently got married and was in search for unique photo albums for my parents & in-laws. I purchased some at a great art/framing store nearby, but realized they didn't match the elegant wedding we had...I remembered seeing a great selection of "blingy", high end photo albums in an assortment of sizes at Artiques over the summer....so off I went to see if my search would hopefully end with my future photo albums still waiting for me.....and to my surprise they had exactly what I saw and needed! They carry a huge selection of fabulous candles and table-scape items, furniture, home decor, design & decorate services but for the higher end, discerning client. My only complaint was with the customer service...young girls busy with texting/FB and uhhh...not very friendly or maybe just a teenage thing......with this area primarily more affluent and a bit older it would make sense to employ happy to work, creative, age appropriate worker-bees .....I still adore this unique little shop so even a 'salty tude' won't keep me away :-))
