5	We came down to the harbor on the later side on a Friday, right at closing time. Coby was great! He saved our weekend. Our prop wouldn't go down and he stayed late to help trouble shoot until we were able to get it in the water. Great customer service.
1	Took in for routine maintenance, when boat was returned had several problems due to there mechanics.  They lost seal to to drive oil reserve cap which we lost all oil,stranded on river. Forgot to hook up speedometer.  Then charged for complete brake job and lights for trailer,they did not replace everything they said they would. Complete rip off and liars,  will never go there again. They were also very rude!
5	We consigned our boat there and knowing that we were upside-down on the loan had our doubts if it could be sold without us owing several thousand dollars.Well, they sold it and I couldn't be any happier with the outcome-zero balance!  The tenacious sales force did it.  These people were awesome to work with.  If I am ever in the market for a new or pre owned boat, I will go here and I would recommend them to my family which is the greatest compliment I can give them.
