5	Love all the time that Simone puts into her work and how things are always done with excellence.  Nesting Place truly cares about giving children the best education possible.  My children don't just enjoy their time with Simone but look forward to it.
5	I found Nesting Place Preschool online while searching for an affordable yet quality preschool program. Ms. Simone's program exceeds my hopes and expectations for a good preschool! I would recommend Nesting Place Preschool to anyone with young children.
5	Love the Reggio Emilia philosophy behind this preschool!!! This is a fabulous alternative approach to schooling our children. Simone creates a loving and supportive environment where the children can explore and discover through a self guided curriculum. My son attended one of the Nesting Places' summer camps and absolutely love it! If you are looking for an alternative approach to education Nesting Place would be wonderful place for your little one.
5	My daughter goes here and LOVES it! She loves Miss Simone. I like the natural approach to learning and the fact that she is learning christian values at the same time. The classroom is set up in a very child friendly, open and bright setting. The children get to play and learn outside as well, which all children love.
