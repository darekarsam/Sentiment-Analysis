3	One word: POUTINE!  Yes, after strolling along St. Laurent, we decided what better place should we enjoy this calorie fest of a plate than at La Belle Province...a greasy spoon spot in its own rights.  The poutine was interesting and far from disgusting, but I don't think I'll be craving it anytime soon.  It was great fun experiencing this Canadian treat.
2	The poutine here wasn't that great. For 6$, you get a relatively small sized serving (which is good I guess, if you're worried about the numbers on the scale). The cheese was definitely 'squeaky', but the fries tasted like they were in the fryer too long (i.e. they tasted burnt) and the gravy was nothing to write home about. But being in a state of inebriation, I still ate the entire thing. Such is life.Considering Frites Alors is just down the street, I recommend going there instead.
