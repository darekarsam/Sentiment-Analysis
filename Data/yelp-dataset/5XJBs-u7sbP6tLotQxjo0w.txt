3	I have never had a drug screening test until today for my new upcoming job.  The location is nice and clean and the gentleman working there was very polite and helped explain everything for me.  I have been told by others sometimes you have to go in front of others or like through some kind of glass, luckily it was nothing like that.  Although having to bring out the filled cup to him was weird/ awkward/ slightly embarrassing, but whatever I finished and was on my way within 15 minutes.
5	I came in for a DNA test and had a very pleasant experience for what was a very stressful situation.  The staff was very friendly and put me at ease.  I was able to get in and out in less than 20 minutes.  Results came in quickly.  I was very appreciative!
