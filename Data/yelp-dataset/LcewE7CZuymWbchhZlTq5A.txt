5	Lenea is AMAZING! I am so glad I chose to have her do my wedding makeup. It was unique and beautiful and exactly what I wanted. She took her time to make sure she got the exact color I wanted. She asked me if I liked it and made any minor adjustments I asked for until I was 100% satisfied with the outcome. She is also one of the sweetest people I have ever met. You will be extremely satisfied if you book her for your special day!
5	I had my makeup done for my best friends wedding and it was beautiful!! I loved the airbrush makeup. I had no clue what colors I wanted and she picked the perfect colors to compliment me! Lenea is a sweet person and will help you look your best :)
5	There are no words to describe how wonderful this woman is... her genuine heart is amazing. .. along with her makeup skills!! I have had Lenea do my makeup for several events and photo shoots over the past few years. And her skills never stop amazing me. When I look at myself in the mirror after her work of art is complete I am in awe. She brings out the natural beauty in every face she touches. What she does for every woman,  bringing up their confidence and teaching them new skills, is a talent that cannot be matched!!!
