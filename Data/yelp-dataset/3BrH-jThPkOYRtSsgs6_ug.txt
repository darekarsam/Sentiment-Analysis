5	They were swamped with people coming in and out of the store.  But we waited in line for help to check my battery.  We got Robert.  He was SO nice!!!  He came out and checked my DEAD battery.  Recommend that I get a new one.  Showed me the liquid vs gel ones. etc.  He helped me remove the old one install the new one too.  I was off and on my way.  Super friendly customer service and got a battery for my car.  :)  3 year warranty!
5	I needed a new battery, so I went to O'Reilly's.  The service was extremely quick and the man that helped me checked not only the charge of the battery, but other basic engine functions as well to make sure they were good.  It was confirmed that I needed a new battery, but everything else was working well.He helped me select the battery that I needed, and even looked into the company database to find that I purchased a battery from O'Reilly's in Michigan some 4/5 years ago, so he gave me a discount for some kind of warranty that he was able to findHe then installed the battery for me at no cost, and it the whole trip only took about 30 minutes.Great service, great products, and very very helpful.
