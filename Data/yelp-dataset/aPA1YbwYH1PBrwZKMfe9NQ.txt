5	Cherry. Rhubarb. Pie.  My boyfriend and I were visiting for the 2013 jazz festival and stumbled upon this lovely place.  After dinner outside in back, we came back into the cafe, where we unexpectedly caught a local jazz show.  We wanted dessert, but all they had were muffins and cherry rhubarb pie.  I'm not much on pie, but we ordered it anyways.  Oh dear God.  Out from the kitchen came a warmed, generous slice of the most delicious pie I've ever had in my life.  The crust was rich, flaky, and had the faintest citrusy taste to it.  The filling was so fresh and not the least bit too sweet.  It was so incredible that we got a piece to go, and then came back again for another piece before leaving Montreal.   I even considered calling this place up to see if they'd ship pie for my boyfriend's birthday.  But I think we'll just have to make another trip to Montreal...
5	Went here for mother's day brunch with a group of six; fantastic menu selection, lots of different vegetarian and non-veg options. The portions were a little smaller than I'm used to in Montreal restaurants, and my food was cold/luke warm when it arrived, but very tasty.Ample parking on the street and a nice little patio out back.
