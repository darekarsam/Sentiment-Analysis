4	Don has always been extremely helpful.  He has went out of his way to make things happen for me for my freshwater fish needs.  From advice, to products, to stock Don is the man.  Many thanks to Don for keeping the LFS alive and offering a better alternative to corporate box fish stores.
5	Always have a great experience with this store. We have bought many fish, couple reptiles as well as equipment and food. Comparing prices, they do a good job to be the low cost provider. There are some bigger stores around, but I like dealing with a store that gives you personal service. Don the owner is usually who I deal with and just a great down to earth person.
5	I have been to many fish stores in my day. This one beats them all. Don, the owner, is a great guy. He knows everything I had a question about and doesn't try to sell me things I don't need. I like to shop small when I can and he has definitely earned my business for life. Check out this store for a great environment and down to earth staff.
