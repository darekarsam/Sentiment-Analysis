2	I feel mean giving a gas station a low ranking. But, this one really is "meh."It's right by my house, so it's a convenient spot. They have all the gas station basics and even an automatic car wash. However, the way it sits aside the freeway intersection, I have to do a U-turn if I'm headed east. You can access directly from the freeway, but that off-ramp is a nightmare.One perk is they have an outdoor water vendoring machine. But, I'm creeped out by the clientele who hang around outside. And, I'm a good-sized dude. One time a bunch of water came out of the gas nozzle I was using before I even started pumping. Meh.Go here if you have to, but QT is just down the street.
1	Worst customer service ever! Looked at me like I was stupid, and totally ignored me when I asked a question!
1	Me: "Do you have any squeegees? There aren't any out by the pumps."Attendant: *shrug* "People take them."Me: "Do you have any more?"Attendant: "No."***I fill up then go back in.***Me: "Do you have a restroom I could use?"Attendant: "No."Me: "There's no restroom?"Attendant: "We have a restroom, but no key."Me: "How does that work?"Attendant: *shrug* "Someone left with the key."
