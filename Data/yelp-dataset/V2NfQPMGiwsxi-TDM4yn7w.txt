3	The idea of burlesque seems great to me.  I like the idea of fun, vibrant women of different shapes and sizes "doin' their thing."  But... this is the second one that I've seen and I'm left feeling so unimpressed.  The two male MC's were not funny and their material seemed reminiscent of a middle school production.  Big Mamma has got a great voice and it was a pleasure to hear her perform.  But for the most part the other girls lip synced during their performances.  And I don't want to be a hater, but I'm going to call it like I see it.  The vast majority of them are not in good shape.  If you don't have a great body, then have a great trick - be crazy flexible or have a butt jiggle trick.   It just wasn't that interesting.  If I wanted to see a not rock solid woman dance sexy to music all I have to do is stay home, turn on "Remix to Ignition," and dance in front of a mirror.  It's mildly entertaining, but I loose my interest after about 3 minutes.*I couldn't find the exact location of Big Mammas Production.  I assume that they are North Carolina based.*

Although Big Momma's never returned our emails and it took awhile for the theater to, they eventually did and accommodated our party very nicely. I am sure this is nothing compared to burlesque in NYC or anything, but I had a fantastic time and honestly recommend this for anyone! Most of the girls are definitely not petite, but they were not unattractive and they are more representative of most American women; I'd guess most were a 12-16 size. The theme this weekend was "Nerdvana" and this was just perfect for our group. My major complaint was the doors opened at 8pm and the show, although scheduled to start at 9pm, didn't start until sometime after 10, I think.
