5	Very knowledgeable and helpful. I went in for a surety bond and he made it very easy and even provided useful tips to help me out. Definitely going to be getting insurance here when my policy is close to an end.
5	King of insurance.Why go anywhere else? For years now after my husband introduced me to Mr Insurance I wondered how I went through life without him. He finds the best deals/rates and is the most knowledgable person I have ever met. Those commercials on TV are just wasting their money because Mr Insurance is where everyone needs to go. Thank you for taking the guessing out and making my life so much easier. -- ashley
