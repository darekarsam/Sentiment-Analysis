5	Simply the best!Kinda expensive but never disapointedYou must dress up ! Great date place!Amazing for group of 6 and you all must eat downstairs where you can sit at the low tables.Decor is great!
3	What beautiful restaurant! The decor is to die for!But the service and food are ok. Actually the service was extremely long and as far as the food goes, 3 of my friends and I found that it eatable yet some dimensions missing in the mix of ingredients. I personally had a Pad Thai and described it as boring...the sauce that generally enhances the combination of shrimps, noodles and all involved was just flat. It as if they had left two colors in the spectrum of the rainbow.But absolutely worth seeing!
