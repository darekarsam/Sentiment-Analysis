4	I was at Paris for a banquet last night and had to come in to this fab store - it is smaller than the Forum shops location but has all of the excellent brands and bling a gal needs!  I tried on a few pairs and admired some new fun shoe designs.  My fave Onex brand had some new styles and colors.  The sales associate was super sweet and chatted with me about my shoe obsession that I inherited from my mom.  I highly recommend this store in either of the 3 locations for a shoe lover!*Note: though this store is in casinos, it is LOCALLY OWNED!!!  and the owner is a native Houstonian like me :)
4	Small store inside Paris, but they have a decent selection of a little bit of everything from sandals to club shoes to pumps. What I also appreciate is that they carry the Foot Petals foot cushions which make shoes way more comfortable!
5	Never miss a chance to go to Shooz when in Vegas -- We stay at Paris most often and I have never been disappointed in my purchases.  Helpful staff -- and reasonable prices.  Thank you!
3	I always visit Shooz when i'm in Vegas. I was disappointed to see they moved locations in Caesars palace. I was also disappointed by the choices of shoes. Lots of blinged out "Vegas"shoes but not a good selection of everyday fabulous shoes as they have had in the past. They had a lot more clothing items and accessories than they had shoes. I did find a really cute blinged out hat but am sad to say no shoes! Stock more shoes please!!!
