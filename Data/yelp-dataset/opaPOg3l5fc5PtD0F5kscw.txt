3	Pretty much what you would expect. Low prices, home style cooking, senior customer base.We've been in twice for breakfast. Average fare descent service. We'll go again and maybe try dinner next time.
2	= = = = = =  DAILY LUNCH BUFFET  = = = = = =Stopped in for a first visit to this JB's to try their daily lunch buffet.  I counted up 49 items, plus sauces & dressings.  After I ate the sandwich & fries noted below, I started on the Buffet with the Bell Pepper Soup and then some Potato Bacon Soup.  Both were good.  Then it was on to the salad offerings, which were generous enough in quantity but somewhat weak in quality.  For example, the carrots were thawed cubes of frozen carrots & the beets were the same.  Ugh.  There were tacos & tostadas which I didn't try, & the fresh fruit & dessert items were ok.This Buffet runs $7.89 (too much), but for just $1.10 more you can add a half sandwich & fries, so I did.  That does turn this all into a FEAST, but...My sandwich platter arrived before the Lunch Buffet was in place (replacing the breakfast version) so I ate what I had first.  This Turkey & Swiss Cheese "Half Sandwich" was BIG, & stacked up  pretty well with turkey.  It actually amounted to a good sized whole sandwich.  The fries side was full-size also.  Unfortunately, the sandwich tasted blah, from the slightly stale thick white bread to the layers of what looked like thin-sliced turkey but must have been reheated in hot water or something.  As I ate it I thought of delicious, similarly named sandwiches I have had at other places around the Valley such as Sacks Art of Sandwicherie & said to myself, Eek, this isn't that!     :-OI also had a cup of coffee which cost $2.99 & wasn't especially good.Sorry Mr. (nice) Manager.  This one just didn't measure up to most of the Valley Buffets in terms of overall food quality & taste.     :-|
5	Homestyle meals.  More elderly and retired age customers than young families there which is exactly how we like it. No screaming, unruly children.  We'll return when we're back this way again.
