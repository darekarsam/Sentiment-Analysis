1	Ug, Do I really have to give this place any stars? I really really passionately dislike this place! It's SUCH an awful place to see a show. It's even more maddening when people I actually like come here because I refuse to go here anymore I think back in the day it was a concert venue, then a dance club and now it's back to concert venue, and regrettably, an under age dance club. Ew. It obviously hasn't been updated in like centuries. It needs help to be modernized or maybe even an attempt to make it a better place to see a show. But sadly no, it's still just a crappy place. You know the thing that really makes me mad? Some good bands and artists come here!! I tried to go, I really did. I went and saw Dashboard Confessional back in the day and he was great, place was awful. Then I just went and saw Ben Folds. He was fabu, place was SO awful! I said to myself after that, NEVER AGAIN! I can't do it. Maybe I should explain why I hate this place and not ramble on about how, well, I hate this place. It's just not conducive to seeing anything! The stage is super small with a wide flat floor beyond it. I think the worst thing is there's a raised platforms on either side of the floor that runs the length of the place. The platform is zig zagged so if you're on the platform you'd think you'd be able to see, but you can't. Then if you're on the floor, surprise, you REALLY can't see! So....the acoustics are awful, the lighting is awful and well...that's all I got. Don't see a show here unless you want to not see or hear anything! My only hope is that these bands start going to the new Stage AE. Let's start hoping!!
