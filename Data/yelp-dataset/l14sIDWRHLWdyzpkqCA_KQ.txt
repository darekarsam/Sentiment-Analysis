5	Ladies and Gentlemen, here it is!! I have had my hair colored for 17 years and have not ever found a colorist as talented or as enthusiastic as AMANDA!! She loves this salon, her craft and guarantees her work. Make and appointment, show up, have a glass, and prepare yourself for greatness. I couldn't be more pleased.
5	Jeremiah is excellent and so nice! You will feel comfortable when your hair is in his hands. I recommend him to all my friends. Love him and his salon!
5	Amanda is amazing! She does an amazing job in coloring hair!
