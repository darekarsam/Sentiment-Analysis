3	This is a pretty good Arby's the food is fresh and relatively fast. The best part about this location is the warm and inviting staff.
4	Order their delicious Reuben! Fast, efficient, courteous service. Extra clean.
1	I understand that you can't cook good after a certian time of night but cold hard food??? Really? I spent 13 dollars of my hard earned money & I didn't expect to get cold food! This is not a good first experience & I WILL NEVER eat at this establishment again!
