5	Pumpkin Marsala Chai.  Tasted just like gingerbread.  I am almost willing to drive the 30 minutes out of my way to get one before work everyday.  I waited almost three months, since I heard the news that they were opening, and went in for their opening celebration.  I was not disappointed.Their coffee does not have the bitter taste like starbucks but is not overly sweet like the Caribou Coffee was, though I do love Caribou.The staff was friendly and had personality!  The cashier, as we were leaving, asked how I liked the chai!  She was genuinely interested which was nice. This will for sure be a hangout/study home for me.
4	I was slightly disappointed that Caribou Coffee was no more. I did LOVE the real chocolate chips they used to make your mocha... anyways - onto Peets - nice re-do of the inside,  very friendly staff,  mocha was pretty good -  I'll be back - but I still miss the extra  melted chocolate sludge left in the bottom of my cup :-)
