2	I have fond memories of coming here after school to indulge in the rare daytime meal that didn't taste vaguely of styrofoam. A few years and a few dozen burrito joints later, I've discovered this place kinda blows. I don't want to make any accusations, but if you told me the sour cream was cut with that "sour topping" bullshit, I wouldn't be surprised. Their guacamole is watery. Their salsas are not spicy or flavorful. They don't add much to the meal. At least they didn't screw up the carne asada. I love when it's got that grilled or skillet fried flavor, because it's kinda lame when it comes straight from just a pot. It's a small family-owned place that's got an expansive menu. There are only like 8 chairs inside. I'll try them again for old-times sake, but there's certainly not a rush.
1	Nasty food , the meat was old and cold and the veggies were even colder the employee was lazy and instead of making it fresh he decided to serve food that was sitting there for a while
5	We go here all the time! There chips and gauc, breakfast chili rellenos burrito it's pretty good food and if you like meat I've been told there steak burrito is bomb
