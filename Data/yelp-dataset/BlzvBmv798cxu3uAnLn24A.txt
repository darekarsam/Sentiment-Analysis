5	This is a quirky place. Full-time place of business. Full-time artist gallery. Now you'd think that wouldn't work... but it does. Ah, the strangeness of Tempe and web-workers.And though it's not open to the public at all times, I'd be on the look out for future events here. The outside patio is immense and beckons with a great view of the mountains and stars. It's got night time entertainment written all over it.Can't wait for the next time!
5	Is it a Gallery?  Is it an intimate place for friends to gather?  It's really both.  #EVFN had the pleasure of having small gathering there tonight 05/01/2009.  This small gallery located in a business plaza around ASU's campus is not only a great location for upcoming artists but has a spectacular view of the surrounding campus.  It's a must see.If you are invited  to or they schedule an event here don't miss it as you will miss out on everything that makes this place special.
5	This has got to be one of the coolest venues to host an event!  I hosted a corporate event in the evening and could not have been happier.  The outside fireplace and patio heaters made the space cozy and inviting.  Lighting was excellent and the restrooms and kitchen were nice and clean.  If your tired of your traditional hotel conference room or restaurant atmosphere this it truly the venue for you!All my emails and questions were promptly answered and the staff onsite were helpful from the time we arrived to the time we left.100% recommended!
