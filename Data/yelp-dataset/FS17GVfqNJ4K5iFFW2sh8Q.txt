2	Holy cow.  It cost me like $25 to get a couple of sweaters dry cleaned here last year.   Granted, they did a good job, and they packed them in some really nice covers, but ouch.  Check pricing before you drop off your stuff here.
5	their prices may be higher than some asian cleaners but their quality of service is excellent. it really shows they take care of their customers clothing. i have never had my shirts packed so nicely when i pick them up at other cleaners. and looking over their work i found no flaws.you get what you pay for here. and i will continue to be their customer :)
1	I had a very bad experience with the store.  Very rude seamstress. She cost the company she works for money because my husband and I will never go there again.  If you are looking for a friendly family business, do not go to Boston cleaners on West Charleston they are expensive, rude and unfriendly.
5	I was on vacation and found this cleaners in the area. They were super friendly and the place is clean. The prices are a bit higher then other places, but they found some casino chips in my pants pocket and returned them to me when I picked up my clothes! VERY IMPRESSED!
5	Boston Cleaners is conveniently located in my neighborhood, and although they do have a pick up and delivery service, I choose to go in because of the great customer service.  Cassandra always greets me by name with a smile and goes out of her way to ensure I have a great experience.  Unlike the $1.50 cleaners where clothes "cleaned" in dirty solvents, Boston uses eco friendly chemicals that are gentle on my clothes and healthy for my body -- I'm willing to pay a premium for this.  Boston isn't the cheapest dry cleaner in town, but you won't find another that will take care of your best clothing the way Boston does.  Tip -- ask for the VIP service and get a cool bag for your clothes and receive a discount.  They also just repaired my suitcase for just $15 -- super convenient.
