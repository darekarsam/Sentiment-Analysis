5	Shannon-I have been going to Wax Works Hair Removal for over 7 years and couldn't imagine going anywhere else.  I live on the West side and drive 45 miles one way to be waxed by Julie and sometime Nathalie when Julie is not available. They are both wonderful!  Julie provides a professional but yet a relaxing and most comfortable atmosphere.  Not only does Julie make you feel comfortable during your services, she makes it pretty painless, now that is an art.  Julie is very thorough and pretty quick and the next thing you know you are done and on your way. I highly recommend Wax Work Hair Removal!
5	Julie is awesome! Very thorough, she misses nothing. She made me feel instantly comfortable in her salon. I didn't feel any self-consciousness. Everything is spotlessly clean, and the ambiance is very cute and welcoming. Her prices are very fair. And the best part- it was the least painful Brazilian I've ever had. Her new location is so adorable. You will not find a better waxer than Julie. I would love to get my eyebrows done by her daughter Natalie as well! She works out of the same salon.Don't go anywhere else!
5	I love Julie! Waxing was super fast.Felt very comfortable.I can't wait to go back.
5	In LOVE!!!! Julie not only waxed everything and I mean everything. She just waxed all hair in the bikini area. She didn't measure and attempt to up-sale me. She waxed my belly button and did the inner thigh so I would feel completely comfy in a bikini of the smallest of proportions. Granted I have no desire to be in a bikini of any size. I feel lighter, happier, and the vegan wax makes me healthier than the petrol chemical wax of the other place. I used to go to the chain wax place and they did a half-assed job and would miss everything. I learned to just tolerate the inadequate wax. They would do two fingers from the crease in my leg and anything beyond that was additional money. I'd end up paying a fortune for a wax job I hated.
