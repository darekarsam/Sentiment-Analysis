5	Best store in Vegas! Great guys running it and WOW do they know their knowledge....."Comic Nerd Heaven" here and I am glad to be a part of it! Great job guys!!! Love your store!
1	Shop says open 7 days a week 11am to 7pm, call and you get a msg saying the same.  Showed up on a Sunday after driving a half hour to check it out and they are closed. It's 2pm and now I'm disappointed and upset.  2 things I was not expecting.  The least you could have done is changed your msg to say you were closed.
5	This is the place for comics, statues, & whatever u need for your collection and if they don't have Tom can get it for you. One of the last true comic stores left...don't pass on this store. ..it would be a mistake.
