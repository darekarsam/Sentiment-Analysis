3	This large mansion type building has huge grounds with benches for customers to use in summer months. It does the 241 deal on meals and for what you pay thay are not too bad but service behind bar especially is terrible with queues constantly.
5	I went here with my fiancee Suzanne today to celebrate her 25th birthday and the place is as good as it can possibly get. The staff are so polite, the food was brilliant and the atmosphere was friendly and welcoming. If your at the south of Edinburgh I strongly recommend it . The place is ideal for family's, small nights out and friendly get together's.
4	Can't go wrong with all you can eat at a great price!
1	Since I hardly ever give out 1-stars I will keep this short and sweet. Was not a fan of the food. Just didn't taste right, you got all you can eat veggies and potatoes but not meat??? You go to a carvery for the meat so why shouldn't you get more then 3 measly slices??? Service blew, had a wait around for a table while the place was practically deserted, had to wait for the "Chef" to carve my table scraps. Was not impressed although when I left and then checked my receipt Im pretty sure they screwed up and didn't charge me the full amount or something cause it was real cheap. Unless of course the food WAS that cheap which is a possibility. Anyways avoid this place its just like another crappy Wetherspoons chain I am sure there are better carvery places in the city.
4	Great family restaurant with lovely food. Always leave with a nice full tummy! Great for kids too.
