1	5 stars for being open later then the closet guy to me. 5 stars for staying past close. It looks like it was needed as I was one of 3 in a 10 min span.5 stars for customer service and making it seem like you were doing me a favor by "splitting" the package to save me money. -15 stars for charging $20.00 for a part that the competitor sells for $4.34.I will never go here again, nor will I suggest that anyone else does.
2	My dryer broke down so I scheduled a service call for the next day. DAY 1 - no call no show, when I called they told me the truck broke down. DAY 2 - successful diagnosis of a failing switch. DAY 3 - the service manager shows up at my house with the wrong part, that he knew was the wrong part, but they told him to come anyway. Reschedule for another visit.At this point, I drive to Apliance Parts Co. in North Phoenix, buy the switch for $30 (half the price I was being charged by Major) and install it myself.They then had the audacity to charge me a "service fee". I'm sorry but if you can't get the job done without wasting 4 of my mornings, you don't deserve a "service fee". When I told him charging me the fee would cost him all future business of mine, he asked "Well how do I know you won't stop dealing with us anyway? We have time invested and need to be paid"Pitiful customer service. Absolutely pathetic.
5	Helped me find the burner plates that actually fit my stove top. Awesome selection, friendly and helpful service.
