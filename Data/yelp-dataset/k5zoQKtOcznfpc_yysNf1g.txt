5	Where does one begin............when a team does everything correctly?!Bill, my driver, arrived 30 minutes early and was both courteous and efficient.  He made us all feel like royalty and took care of our every need.  The vehicle, a stretch Excursion SUV was immaculately clean both inside and out and Bill graciously ensured there was no feature left unexplained.  Also, I love that they DON'T have any hidden fees - what they say is exactly what you get. We are trying to find reasons to call them again to take a ride in their cars.  I can't imagine anyone going through anything less than a 5 star experience with Surreal Limo. We will ALWAYS be using their services for future car service needs.  Thank you to Bill and the Surreal Team!
5	My company hired Surreal Limousine for our holiday party and I couldn't have been happier. We had a large group so took both an Escalade and a stretch Excursion. Tim was our driver in the Excursion and not only did he arrive early to pick us up, he was friendly and accommodating to all of our needs. I would highly recommend using Surreal for any kind of group gathering - I know I will again!
5	Awesome service! The limo was great looking and super clean, the driver was very friendly and was early. Also - the pricing was extremely reasonable, even during "prom" season when everyone else jacks up rates. I've used other limo companies in the Valley and was really impressed with this one.  Definitely recommend.
