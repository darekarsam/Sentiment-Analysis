5	Perfect beef carpaccio - fresh, paper thin, capers, oil, aged cheese.  Wonderful seafood risotto.  Plus the best pizza I have had - Favorita, I think it was called - fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, pepperoncini, olives, thin, crispy yet chewy crust.  Beautiful wine list, friendly service, indoor al fresco dining (Venetian's simulated Venice.)  We LOVED this place.  You have to try it.
5	If you are looking great Italian dinner, swing by and you will truly enjoy there service, food and view of all the people walking by, there calamari or minestrone soap is just a perfect way to start your meal, as for entree go with there baked in salt Seabass, it takes around 25 min to make but it is so worth it, plus they can remove the bones in front of your table for you if you like. :-))
4	Although its not Venice, Italy it was outstanding.  In a piazza like setting with Renaissance street entertainment, we thoroughly enjoyed a dinner & a lunch at the Canaletto.  Ceasar salads were fresh with a nice dressing.  The pizza would certainly stand up to many from the motherland.  Our service (Nadia?) was a pleasant and friendly as anyone could be.  Highly recommend....
