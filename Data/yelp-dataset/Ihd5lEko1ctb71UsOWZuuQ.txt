2	I believe that Streets of New York is a chain, and I've certainly enjoyed my experience at other locations, but this one in particular was a bit of a disaster. The food was all right, but the service was slow and unfriendly. The waiters were borderline anti-social and another guy who seemed to be the owner or at least the manager wasn't much better. If you're yearning for Streets of New York Pizza, try another location.
1	This is just a bad place to eat period. I ordered a pizza and was told it would be ready in 20 mins, I showed up on time and asked for my order two of the employees huddled up really.quick and one went to the back the other said it would be a few mins. The other girl never came back up and the other girl was making a huge excuse about the register being locked. I know they never put my order in as the girl trying to unlock the register was playing with her phone more than trying to fix the problem. After waiting 10 mins I walked out and when I said I was she made no last ditch effort to save the sale other than "are u sure?" I would give this place a zero star and would never visit this site again.
1	Shocker this place closed!  This location was open for a long time and was great for a lot of it. I don't know if owners changed or what but it went downhill fast. The service got awful and the quality of the food got bad too. I would be sad that this location closed but I had already quit going to this location months before they shut the doors.
1	I called this location to order a pizza for delivery. I was staying at the La Quinta down the street. I received a message stating this location had been closed. They did provide two other locations and numbers for their other locations that could assist me. I did call one of their other stores, I am writing a review for that store separately. I am only giving it 1 star due to it being closed (why rate my past experiences at this location now).
