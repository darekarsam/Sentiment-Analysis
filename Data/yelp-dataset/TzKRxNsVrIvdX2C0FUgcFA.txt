5	Sawyer Aviation attended to our needs above and beyond our expectitations. We highly recommend them. Thanks to Chad and evevybody involved in our flight.
2	I underwent their "half hour" introductory flight lesson.But the experience was way below expectations. I thought they would let me actually handle the flight for long, but it was very very short lived experience.  Their coordination with control was messy & spoiled the whole experience.
5	I was recently in Scottsdale for a meeting. I came out a day early to do some local flying. I wanted to fly to the Grand Canyon. I rented a C162 at Sawyer. The experience was great. The facility is neat and clean. The planes are well maintained. Even though I hold a private pilots license. I usually take an instructor with me for the local knowledge and the fact that I don't have to waste time on a rental check out. I meet Roslyn who was to be my instructor that day. She was pleasant and had already researched the weather in route to the canyon. We flew north and stopped at Sedona for fuel. We decided that the weather was a little questionable to make the canyon so we headed back to Scottsdale. It was a great flight. After returning to the airport I met Chad the company president. He was very nice. I would not hesitate to fly at Sawyer aviation in the future and look forward to coming back next year and making it to the canyon.
5	Loved the experience. It was my first time as well as hubby's first time. Bought a 30 minute sunset flight over a city of our choice (nearby of course) for a romantic birthday surprise for the boyfriend. We both did not know what to expect. Specially him who had no idea what we were doing there. Lol the 2 wonderful guys were kind enough to keep everything a secret for the hubby. We enjoyed every second seeing the sun set. It was beautiful! After our flight with our amazing pilot we had a champagne toast. Definitely looking forward to another one.
