4	Growing up this was my grandparents favorite restaurant. For over 50 years whenever they chose to eat out... Te diner it was. Going here is like going to your grandmas for dinner. The  food is always good, generous, and the desert always specific to the day.
4	They're not my absolute local favourite (that's reserved for Jack's), but they're definitely one of my default choices for a place close to campus. Watch out for the weekend, because they get very busy for brunch especially on Sunday!Had a "homestyle benedict" (peameal bacon and a slice of cheese topped with hollandaise) that was delicious. Service was not particularly fast, but it was friendly.
4	Food: I always got the general eggs, sausage, home friends meal and it was pretty good/average. I eat breakfast out a lot so nothing really amazes me. My friend swears the eggs benedict here is really good though!Atmosphere: It's actually really quaint and like another reviewer said it feels like I'm eating at a grandparent's place. Parking: It's in a plaza with a pretty big parking lot so you shouldn't find any difficulties.
