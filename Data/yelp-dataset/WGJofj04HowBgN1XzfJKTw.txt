3	The Pink Hanger is yet another upscale fashion boutique in the Charlotte area. It's small, has some nice things but is generally very expensive and had nothing that made me feel the urge to make a purchase. The girls behind the counter asked me if I needed any help, and were doing their job, but were not very genuine, and did the whole "up down" look that some girls do to other girls. Not very comfortable. The sale section is very small and I didn't see any great scores back there. The one good thing I did like is that they had some unique under garments to get you through sticky wardrobe situations, like double sided sticky tape for your nips and such. They've even got a little nifty belly button cover for the preggers ladies out there.
4	I'm shocked The Pink Hanger doesn't have more reviews! It's pretty much everything any shopportunistic lady could want at Providence & Sharon: plenty of cute clothes, affordable accessories and gorgeous items to complete your look. With brands like Amanda Uprichard, Three Dots, Joie, Fifteen Twenty and Trina Turk, The Pink Hanger really shines with their casual but modern wear. Mind you, there are also plenty of cocktail dresses, a small selection of denim and super cute jackets. Regardless, I really love their selection of casual and versatile tops - silk tanks, comfy knits, etc. Accessories are well stocked, with affordable jewelry in the $20-$50 range, purses and clutches of all sorts and a nice selection of items for a gift or special occasion. i.e. Miniemergency kit, Footzyrolls, candles, etc.  If you're driving around town, stop in at The Pink Hanger. The nice ladies here will help you find whatever you're looking for and Roger, the adorable pup, will sweetly greet you.
1	Giving this place 1 star because the hours of operation show 10am and when I arrived the store was closed and does not open until 11am.  Bad customer experience.
