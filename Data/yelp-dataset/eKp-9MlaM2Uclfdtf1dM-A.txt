3	Pretty good food here, and you won't be disappointed, but perhaps not the best either. The place is extremely well appointed, and unfortunately I think we end up paying a little more because of the decor. I had a pretty traditional Thai dish, which was presented plainly but well enough, and was spiced just about as I would have expected (in terms of heat) from the number of chilies appearing next to the name of the dish on the menu, so order with confidence. The beer selection is sorely lacking, but the wine list seems to be OK. This might be a good place to go before you catch a movie at Colossus; pricey date, but it's the ambiance, you know..
4	I've found this food to be pretty good as far as Thai food goes. The wait staff is very friendly and the food comes out very quickly. The decor and location are both very nice with standard outdoor cafe seating during the nicer months and plenty of indoor seating. I've been there twice now and it's my standby restaurant if I want some good Thai food in the Laval area of Montreal.
4	Unbelievably fresh ingredients. Amazing decor and very nice ambiance. One on the highest end Asians in Laval
1	Keep going there and every time I wonder why.  Probably, the first few times, it was good.  But I can confidently say that it is not good anymore.  Went there for lunch today (for the last time) it was awful.  Not much to do withThai food, more cheap American Chinese.  The place was also empty on a Friday noon...  Should tell you something.  For three of us for the lunch menu: $140+ tip - one bottle of average wine.  It 10pm and I am still feeling the food.  Not a good feeling...
3	Let's just say decor is awesome. Their vege eggrolls are very good. The rest is allright. Salmon tartar looks nice but tastes really funny. All in all I would pay for the atmosphere and just to feel luxurious a little but I def don't go very often.
