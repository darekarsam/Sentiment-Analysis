4	One of my favourite spots in the city. Market type of menu, always changes. There's the usual red meat, fowl and usually two options for sea food. The staff has always been great to us. Upscale-ish food, but down to earth service with a genuine smile. I feel comfortable bringing anybody from a foodie to a hot dog lover to this place and I know they'll enjoy their experience.Wine list is generally french but the staff can always recommend a perfect pairing. If you're buying a bottle, expect a dinner for two in the $150-$170 range with an appetizer and a dessert.
4	Wow! Only one review yet?! Incroyale! Don't miss this place. Service is super nice, food is simple and really good. Nice price range for the quality of the place. With friends great but better for a date!
