5	So helpful! The staff knows me by name, and I notice they know a lot of their patron's names. They are very friendly and professional, I always feel at home here. Scott's the teller supervisor, and he's very reasonable and attentive to customer's when there's a problem, and they always have great tellers on-board. I hope this bank never changes!
1	I have been a Bank of America customer for 14 years.  The last 10 years I have been a loyal customer of this branch.  I have gotten to know the employees on a first name basis and had felt very satisfied with the service.  The last few months at this branch have been a disaster! The drive thru will be closed although the posted sign says open.  The line in the branch are routinely 8 deep in customers and the wait is at least 15 min. What persuaded me to write this review is last week I went into the branch to make a deposit.  The manager informed me there would be a 25 minute wait.  I communicated that the service at the branch had deteriorated.  He said the service was still good but that the wait was just longer.  HELLO!  He suggested I make the deposit at the ATM. He said the bank is in transitioning into more on-line banking.  I left and drove a couple of miles to Stapley and Main branch.  Was in and out in 5 min.  Not going back to Main and Mcdonald.
1	Slowest and most incompetent staff of any bank I've ever been too. We have to bank here for work and there is never enough people working, drive through is always broken, no merchant window etc etc
