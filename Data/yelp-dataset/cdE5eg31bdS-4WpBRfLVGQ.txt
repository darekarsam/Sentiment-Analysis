1	Minus 10 !!!   Young guys laughing and joking. They stand around while one walks thru and counts what is needed to price for the job. YOUR paying for this time also even before they load one item. The clock is ticking during this down time. Also know YOU pay for the time driving to the destination.They Banged the walls. They Scratched so many pieces of quality furniture.I think if I ever moved again and they were the only movers, I would sell my house and Include the furniture. I put boxes down and requested them to please not cut thru that room. They kicked the boxes out of the way. TWICE !!!!
5	I had a wonderful experience with this company.  I bought a huge heavy bedroom set from an estate sale.  The narrow curved staircase was a nasty challenge which they handled very well. Pieces were carefully wrapped and carefully unwrapped.  At my home they set up the bed and then moved a couple of heavy pieces around until I was happy with the layout.  They were swift and professional. I have recommended them to friends.
