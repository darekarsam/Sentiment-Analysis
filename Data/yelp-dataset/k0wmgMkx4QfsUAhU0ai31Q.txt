1	They called me when I purchased my new home a few times. I gave in to the sales pitch and we scheduled an in home estimate. They called 3 hours before the estimate was supposed to happen and asked to reschedule. They had no record of my appointment and both the callers that I spoke with were inexperienced and did no seem to know what was going on. If they can not organize their sales team how are they going to install a window?
5	Just had my new windows and doors installed. I was very impressed with the superior ratings of their product and even more happy with their pricing. The installation went smooth and the team was very friendly. I would definitely recommend this product.
2	I have no doubt the product is top notch, but there is only one product this company sells for Windows, and your budget is irrelevant. You get all the extras whether you want them or not. The salesman could sell a vacuum to a hobo, but don't make a snap decision. There are very similar Windows for much less. Any company who gives you a time limit on the quote makes me leery. And it looks like I was right to be.
