5	They were able to schedule an appointment for me the day that I called. I have called before looking for an appointment on short notice. If they couldn't get me into the Scottsdale office they were able to help me in one of there other offices. They were more than accommodating to my needs.The staff and doctors were welcoming and very helpful. I will gladly comeback to Arrowhead for any of my medical needs.
5	Best doctor's office I've ever been to.  Hands down.  Even though I called on a Monday  morning, they were able to get me in that same day.  The staff were friendly and very accommodating.  My doctor was awesome and helped me resolve a health problem I've had for years.  I couldn't believe how easy and convenient everything was.  Would highly recommend this health center to everyone!
1	Every time I need something like a prescription sent to a pharmacy or called into the Insurance company it doesn't get done until I call over and over again.  I'm not sure what the problem is but I think I now see why it was so easy to get an appointment here, maybe other people go where they can actually get things done?  it's really frustrating when you call twice in one week to get a prescription filled, then you call once the following week and still nothing so you call two days later and of course there aren't even any notes that you ever called the first three times.  I've had enough!!
