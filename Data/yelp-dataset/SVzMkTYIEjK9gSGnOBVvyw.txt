5	This is such a wonderful place.  I only recently discovered it, as I was invited there as a guest to celebrate Thanksgiving last year.  Done in true Canadian style, they have wonderful facilities for working out and playing racketball, squash, etc.They also have a wonderful bar and terrific dining facilities.  And the food -- although I know I was here for a holiday, it was plentiful, delicious and varied.  They served it buffet style and had everything from wonderful smoked meat, turkey, cheeses, fruit, etc. -- it was served and presented beautifully.  I believe you can also rent the space for a catered affair as well.All in all, this is a place that exudes beauty, class and a comfortable atmosphere to socialize and exercise in.  I hope to go back later this year to celebrate Thanksgiving yet again -- and for those not in the know, Canadian Thanksgiving is the same weekend in October as Columbus Day in the states.
5	I have been a member at this club for many years.The gym equipment is top notch, clean, never crowded and they have free fitness class of all sorts. Centrally located.
5	Squash courts, gym and all the other amenities you'd expect from a first rate club. I came here on a guest pass, but feel as though I'll be signing up for a membership soon. It feels like the kind of place you could go and spend hours in... a third space, away from work and home. Haven't been to the restaurant yet, but I feel like it's the perfect place to watch a Habs game, or unwind after a long day. Would highly recommend coming here, if only just to try it out. Chances are that you'll be back soon.
