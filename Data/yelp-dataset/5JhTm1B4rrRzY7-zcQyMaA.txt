5	The Caledonian Brewery has been producing fine ales since the second half of the nineteenth century and still is one of the most thriving businesses in the city. The brewery is unusual in a way as it focuses on brewing cask conditioned ale, which was normally brewed in England. The stable ales that the brewery produces are Deuchers IPA and Caledonian 80 (a more typical Scottish like ale).  However, throughout the years the brewery has produced a variety of different ales for special occasions. Ales such as Over the Bar, Highland Fling, Auld Acquaintance and Old Seadog are just some the ales which reinforced by enjoyment of Caledonian Brewery.I started purely on Deuchers IPA and from then on, I began my journey through the many quality ales that this brewery produces. If you want to taste the best of Scottish brewing, then why not taste a tipple from the Caledonian Brewery!
