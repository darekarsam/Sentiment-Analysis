1	They are like robots because they have no human compassion and see everything in black and white.
1	This place sucks. Dont come here. The service is awful. Very unfriendly even tho I'm helping pay there salaries. Beds are very uncomfortable and no room service.
5	Had to call the Police for the first time ever. This Department responded very fast. The officer was very approachable and resolved my issue quickly. Thank you Gilbert Police Department!!!! I just moved to Arizona a few months ago, and knowing we have such great officers in Gilbert  eases my mind.
