4	When I require lab tests, this is the Quest office I choose yo go to most often. It is not the most convenient as far as location goes. Not for me anyhow. But it is the one I have had the best experiences with. There has hardly ever been a line or long wait here. Perhaps this is due, in part, to its secret location. I am taking a big risk in telling this to you all. It is near the lamp store and in the back of a two story building that looks only to have one floor. You enter from a back door and up a narrow flight of stairs. It is kind of freaky the first time you go in and does not get much more comfortable the second or third time either. It is worth facing your fears, though, to avoid the bothersome crowds at other more pleasant looking Quests. And if you get Tina drawing your blood, consider yourself lucky. She is the nicest phlebotomist I've seen in a long time. She puts you at ease and makes the trauma of having your arm skewered more bearable.
1	It is closed. Still listed in Yellow Pages, but the building is abandoned.
5	This place is great. The front desk people are Pleasant, professional and care about people. Erwin did my blood work and he was great, I didn't even feel the needle and he couldn't have been more professional. Great job guys, really appreciate the great service . My husband went to Burnham and that was a nightmare.
