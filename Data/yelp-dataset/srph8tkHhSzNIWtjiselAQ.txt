2	Not much in the way of products, tried their lips balms, Green Beaver was a bust, they no longer carry it, too many complaints. Their Crazy Rumours line is great , their Cheeky line of mineral make-up not so. Best to just keep going in from time to time and checking out their stock.
4	Super friendly staff. Cute little boutique with all kinds of vegan odds and ends. I mostly go for the food and sweets which include a lot of products (tofutti spread, marshmellows, veganaise) that many other shops don't carry. They also have a freezer section-pizzas, chick'n and such, as well as a take-out/cupcake counter. A small selection of cosmetics and bath products and even vegan cat and dog food. A little pricey, don't expect to do your regular shopping here, but that's to be expected for a specialty store. A fun treat if you're looking for guilt-free fixins.
