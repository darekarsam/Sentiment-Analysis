4	This is a large baby store that has a great selection of furniture and strollers. The staff are very friendly and will help explain to you all the great functions of a stroller. Parking is in the back, so no need to worry about looking for something on the street.
4	This specialized Baby Store is everything a mother or a mother-to-be can wish for. Lots of strollers, furniture and cribs selections are to be had in a spacious environment where staff on repeated visits have more than helpful to my mother-to-be wife and I.Plenty of clothes are available for babies of all ages and many items are available for whatever need you may have.However, kindly note that for some electronic devices you're better off comparing prices for them online or at other stores as I found far more reasonable deals for them elsewhere. For example, if a baby monitor is sold here at $300, you can easily find the same one, brand new, a few blocks away for $200. They should not mark up their prices to this degree.
2	Great selection of babystuffs, though the location is not as well-kept as the store in Laval. Parking lot often hard to get around too. Amidst the few very well priced articles, beware some huge markups on items readily available elsewhere for a lot less... (50-60% less in a few specific instances.) Service is hit or miss, depending on who you happen upon. Refund policy is very store-friendly instead of customer-friendly.
