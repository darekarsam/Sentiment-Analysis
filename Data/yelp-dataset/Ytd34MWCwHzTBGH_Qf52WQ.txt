4	Sushi is excellent but they only give you 6 rolls compared to many other places that give you a full sushi roll of 8. I also ordered lo mein which was really good because it was made with the thick noodles instead of the cheap thin ones. I like that they have both Japanese and Chinese food because a lot of people don't like sushi but like Chinese. I would rate Mr. Wok five stars if they gave the right amount of rolls. The roll shortage wouldn't bother me if it was not the same price as places that give you the 8 rolls. Please fix that Mr. Wok!!!!!!
5	Wonderful food. Peaceful and quiet atmosphere. Chen, the owner is incredibly hospitable. Don't be fooled by the shabby exterior, its well worth a visit.
2	Just tried the Chinese food which was mediocre at best by my picky standards. Maybe the sushi would have been better. This location was originally home to Yen's for many years- an exceptional neighborhood Chinese restaurant which closed about a year ago due to illness. My expectations were no doubt high and unfortunately not met. I used to make a 20 minute drive for Yen's but don't expect to do the same for Mr Wok.But try it yourself if you're in the area and write a review to confirm or deny my experience.
5	This place in increditable. It is a MUST TO GO! Outside may seem a little dated but that has nothing to do with the food inside. One of my favorite Asian Restaurants in town!
