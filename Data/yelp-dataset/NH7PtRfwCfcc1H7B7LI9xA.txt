4	Charlotte gas North of this exit = 3.54Gas across the street from this gas station 3.19Gas here = 3.09NEED I TYPE MORE???SIMPLE ECONOMICS
3	The cheapest gas in Charlotte, mostly because it's in Fort Mill and so has the lower South Carolina fuel taxes. Expect to save a quarter per gallon at least compared to anything north of here for 100 miles to where I-77 ends and merges with I-74 in Mount Airy, NC at the Virginia border. If you're low on gas, here's your stop.This station is fully stocked with a Subway and the usual selection of Coke and Pepsi products plus cold beer (not for driving of course!), salty and sweet snacks to keep you humming along as your tires eat up the asphalt.Welcome to South Carolina: Smiling faces and beautiful places.
4	Alright. So if you know me, you know I actually dont have the need to drive that much anymore, but when I do I make sure to fill up here at Kangaroo. The sign out front also says its Marathon gas. It is right past Red Rocket and I started going here because Red Rocket stopped selling lotto. Glad I did! I don't go in to buy food/drinks very often, but they have all that good stuff as well as ice cream and an ATM, etc. The staff is typically so friendly and keep everything stocked. They have about 16 pumps I think but during traffic time, try and avoid unless you have a few mins because since it is right at the state line, people like to fill up since the gas is about 40 cents cheaper than in Charlotte.
3	I used to stop at this station just across the border in SC about once a month after a lunch at Cracker Barrel for a cheaper fill-up.  During lunch time, the pumps are typically full with a minor wait, and one or two pumps will usually be covered with an out of order plastic bag.  It had been a while since I ventured down, but I thought that biscuits and cheap fuel would be a good way to spend lunch time today.  After a lunch at Cracker Barrel down the street, I thought I would pop in and fill-up for the weekend because the gas is going to be WAY cheaper, eh?  Formerly, yes - I have filled up at this station before and it was usually quite a bit less than Charlotte, and worth the drive.  Today, not so much.  Knowing I needed to get fuel, I looked at the price at the Kangaroo station directly across from my office on Tyvola, which was $3.39/gal.  Not awful, but not great.  I figured SC would be at least $.20 less per gallon.  At this Kanagaroo at lunch time, it was $3.29 (a dime a gallon cheaper) and the parking lot/fuel pumps looked like the gas crisis of the 1970's (or 2008 in Charlotte where people were getting shanked while waiting to fill up their tanks for $4.50/gal.).  Cars lined up, folks going the wrong way, backing up onto Carowinds Blvd... what in the world?!  I quickly calculated in my head that I would need 20 gallons to fill up, so dealing with this clusterexpletive would save me $2.00 (I want my two dollars! - guess the movie).  Because bail for my potential assault charge would be much more than that, I headed back to 77 to get back to the office and fill up with a more rational crowd.  I guess the fuel savings are more hit or miss than they used to be.  As the gas prices continue to rise as folks hit the road for summer trips, I may check out this station again for a bargain, but I will go BEFORE the lunch crowd hits next time.
3	Fairly standard gas station stop here, but super busy since it is on the border between NC and SC across the street from Carowinds.  I usually go here later in the evening and you don't have to wait for a pump, but during the day, I've driven by with lines that are 2-3 cars deep.The location is convenient to I-77... I'm not a big fan of Carowinds Blvd since people seem to drive every where they want to and not follow the lines on the road, but that's just my side-issue.
3	** I stopped here to fill up after leaving Frugal McDougals, on my way home. ** This gas station did not impress me as being anything special, but I was able to pay at the pump with no problem. ** I cleaned my windshield with a squeegee that would have fit Paul Bunyan. ** The prices were as cheap as any at the Carowinds exit. ** The station is also on the right side of the highway, which makes it easy to merge back onto interstate 77 north. ** I would stop here again next time.
