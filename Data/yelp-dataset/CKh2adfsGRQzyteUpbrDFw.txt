5	When it comes to hipster syles and unique trendy clothes, this place has the best selection.  I think I have to say that Urban is hands down my favorite store to shop, but I think more than clothes, I love their uncommon gifts and items that they sell throughout the store.From flasks to books to dorm stuff to decor, Urban has some of the coolest and funniest items I have seen.  Last time I was here I bought a drinking helmet for college, and just the other day I bought drinking straw glasses.  You could seriously spend hours just walking around and looking at all the cool and unnecessary but totally wanted items throughout this hipster store.
2	I stop by this store occasionally over my lunch break and always just leave thinking "meh." Sometimes I see a thing or two that looks cute but am unmotivated to try the items on because the staff is so unfriendly. I enjoy looking at their books, jewelry, and home decor. However, they used to have a little home section in the back of the store, and since they recently re-shuffled the store, I believe the home section is now gone. So sad, especially since this is the only Urban Outfitters in Pittsburgh!
