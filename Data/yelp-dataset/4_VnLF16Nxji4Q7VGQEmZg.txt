5	Just discovered FH recently while looking at their You Tube video about TX programing for a Blade 350QX.I wanted to purchase a UMX Pitts and they had the item in stock and also had a 5% off coupon active.The on-line ordering was easy and the item arrived in California in about 3 days.I usually buy from a larger on-line e-tailer buy I think I'll be doing more business with FH as a result of this great experience.
5	Great selection of Quad Copters and helicopters, but most important, the hard to find parts you can't get at stores like Hobby Town, etc. Very knowledgeable staff and like their sign says, "Friendly". Glad I found them!
5	Friendly hobbies is by far the best shop I've been to. Very knowledgable and customer service is superb. I refuse to shop anywhere else after finding these guys!
