1	What a horrible customer service organization, after waiting for 5 hours they call and tell me they aren't coming and ask me to take another day off work and wait for another 5 hour window.I'd rather wash dishes by hand, I'd avoid them at all cost.
1	Awful customer customer.  We scheduled an appointment for today for quote on a new AC unit.  They called me 2 times to confirm the appointment.  Today I receive a call saying they're not coming.  If a customer is treated like this by sales when trying to buy a $6000 air conditioner, I can only imagine how bad it would have been with their service calls.
1	Don't bother calling the "local" Sears number if you are looking for lawnmower parts.  You get routed to a call center in Bangladesh, or New Delhi ..   Not sure ... who are nice enough - but provide useless information about what they have in their warehouse in Toronto.
