5	Amazing. Beers are $1.50 and they will give you a freezer pop if you ask. Be sure and ask.
5	This bar is an enabler, and I am thankful for that. For all of my (underage) drinking that occurred here when I lived in Pittsburgh. It's cheap, tiny, and awesome. Rarely crowded, or it used to be rarely crowded. Plus they have an awesomely shitty pool table where your cues won't be straight and the table is probably uneven, and it's impossible to line up a shot without hitting the wall.
5	The definition of a dive bar. It's a few blocks off Carson and well worth the walk. I was able to order 1.50 can of Rolling Rock and wanted to stay all night. Locals will recognize the mother and daughter combo who both sometimes work and frequent the bar from Black and Gold Beer Warehouse on 10th and Bradish as they work there as well. Great place to stop for a Southside dive bar crawl or for a low key night out.
