5	Just had my carpets and furniture (upholstery) cleaned by Bill M. with Trademark Carpet Services. They looked stunning and smell so refreshing. Trademark Carpet Services uses top of the line cleaning equipment. They even showed me how the equipment works and how much dirt was being removed. Bill M was honest, trustworthy, professional and courteous. In addition, he was very knowledgeable and informative. I would recommend this company to everyone. Thanks for your hard work, Bill. I look forward to using you again in 6 months.
