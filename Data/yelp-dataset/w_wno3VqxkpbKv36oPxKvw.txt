5	Amanda is by far the best I have found!  She is worth the drive every time!  She takes her time and does high quality work. You won't be let down!
5	I have been using Amanda for just about a year and been going to her every 2 weeks. I love her attention to detail and how she doesn't rush her job.
5	Amanda is absolutely amazing. Her attention to detail is amazing. She listens and takes her time. She focuses and pampers you. Highly recommend her to anyone looking for a true nail artist.
