5	Great American Title has been doing title work for me for many years. Sheryl Stone and Katie Bisenius are real pros in the business. I love working with them.
5	Our closing went smoothly because the professionals at this title agency helped us to deal with a difficult buyer.  Also, their prices a really fair compared to some other title agencies that nickel and dime customers to death.  Will only work with them in the future because I know I can trust them. Donna Waltz was our escrow officer and she was really good.
