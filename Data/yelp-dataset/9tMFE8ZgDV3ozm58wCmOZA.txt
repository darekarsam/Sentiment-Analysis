5	This is one of the most beautiful buildings in Champaign-Urbana.  Now that the weather is not so offensive, it's prime time to enjoy one of the numerous patios/balconies to get some work done in the fresh air.  The entire building is wireless, so anywhere is work-friendly.  There is always a cool piece of digital art being displayed in the main lobby area near the cafe which is worth your attention.  If you have time, check out the rather nice display cases on the history of computer sciece at Illinois which lends the answer to the question, "Why do so many famous people graduate from here?" (Founders of yelp included!)
5	How can you not feel inspired to do a good job, work or study hard in the Siebel Center? Maybe because some of the hardest things you can do in life involve math, and I for one, would need all the amenities, clean surfaces and bright light to stay focused on the incredibly difficult work that happens in the Siebel Center. If you want to feel like a rock star or rocket scientist, come study or read here -- where a great coffee and sandwich bar with incredible hummus wraps can be found on the main floor. If I were to be snowed into any building on campus for a day, I would choose this one and kick back with two shots of espresso and a lovely view of the courtyard.
5	Easily my favorite building on campus.  During spring semester final exams, while most engineering students are in Grainger Engineering Library, I studied math on the balconies of Siebel Center.
5	Great state of the art facility, funded by the very generous Thomas Siebel. A lot of the research that changes the world goes on in this facility. It's spacious, busy yet quiet, and full of amazing people working all day long.
