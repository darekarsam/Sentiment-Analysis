5	These guys do excellent work. I recently got side-swiped by some jackass on the street so I called my insurance company and they referred me to Campus Body Salon. It was close to my work and approved my by insurance company. I dealt with Todd Elliott and he was great to deal with -- very friendly and caring. I dropped my car off before a out-of-state trip and got back to find my car all done and ready for pick up. My car looked perfect like it had never been hit at all. If you need bodywork for your car definitely check out Campus Body Salon. They do an excellent job and are a pleasure to deal with!
5	Excellent work -- completely satisfied with the job they did.
5	I made an account specifically so I could give these guys 5 stars. Got me right in, incredible customer service. They were all, specially Nate who helped me, so sweet and nice. Really helped me out and you could tell that they truly care about their customers. Fair charges, and they did a really great job. I will now recommend this place to anyone who needs auto work done. I won't go anywhere else. Great people and great work
