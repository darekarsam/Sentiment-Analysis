5	I always love coming here. Everything has always worked fine for me and my car is always clean when I leave here. Just wish the air fresheners actually would last more than two days! I can't see paying $14.95 for a monthly car wash fee but hey if you have the money and you wash your car more than once a month I guess it COULD be worth it.
3	One thing I can say about this place is that the vacuums suck. They really do suck! I hate it when a place advertises free vacuums with wash and then the vacuums have more noise making power than suction power, that's not the case here, I was able to get the inside of my car pretty clean.What caught my attention was the advertised 2.99 car wash, cheapest price I have seen in the valley.The place is not fancy, the trash cans by the vacuums were overflowing, the machine where you pay was pretty old and dirty but the actual wash was good and got rid of a lot of dirt on my car. This is nowhere near my side of town, so I doubt I will be coming back, but if you need a good cheap car wash, this is a good place to go.
