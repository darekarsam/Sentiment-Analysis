5	Great place to take your devices to get repaired for fast quality work. (2 hrs) Very friendly and cannot beat the price. Thanks Hunter.
5	Had a nasty accident with my iPhone and did some searching on the Internet for replacement options when I came across iCracked. Within seconds, I submitted my information. Les than 5 minutes later Hunter called and we had an appointment set for later in the afternoon. In less than one hour my phone was back in hand and good as new. No hidden charges, no catches. Just a straightforward, high quality business. Thank you Hunter!

5	Hunter met me after I installed a new screen, but wasn't seeing anything on my phone. He was quick to respond to my inquiry, met me on time, explained everything, was very friendly... And best of all he fixes my phone. I truly appreciate the high quality service!
