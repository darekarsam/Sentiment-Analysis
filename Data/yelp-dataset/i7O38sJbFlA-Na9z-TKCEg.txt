5	Great guys and fast service! My truck was completely transformed by the full detail and carpet treatment after it was trashed from a move. If you are like me and never carry cash, be sure to get a tip voucher so you can use your card for the tip. I will definitely come back!
5	They were quick and efficient from what I could see.  They offer a $4 ride through service that gives you a basic wash, no dry which is great when I just need a quick wash of my car to get off gunk.
5	I never thought I'd spend more than $10 on a carwash until I stopped at Autobell.  I thought to myself, $25 for a carwash?  Really?  And an automated car wash at that.  I've since changed my tune after having my car washed there many times.  The extra $$ isn't so much about the car wash itself, its the service provided after the car has been washed.  I've never seen a harder working group of people.  Depending on what you get, they will completely towel dry you vehicle, wash the inside of your windows, shine your tires, and wipe down your dashboard with Armor-all.  What I can tell you is this - I've paid $200 to get my car detailed before at Honda.  I've been happier with the $25 car wash at Autobell.  I should have saved myself $175.  That being said, they do have a $4 ride through option that I also used in between the more thorough washes I described.  The $4 ride through is more of what I was initially thinking when I thought the $25 options were over priced.  You don't get any frills.  You sit in your car while it goes through the automated wash cycle - thats it.  No towel dry or any other service.  This is a great option most of the time for me.  Great job Autobell!!!
