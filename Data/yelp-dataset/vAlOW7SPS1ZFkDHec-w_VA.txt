3	We've only been once so far but the wings and fries were good.They have subs (fried fish, Philly or chicken cheesesteaks, cold or hot veggies...), wraps, burger platters, fish plates, chicken plates and more.I was reallllly happy to find this place. It reminds me of carry outs from back home. I've been in the Charlotte area for seven years now and this is the first time I've found a spot like this one.It's in a small-ish corner so keep your eyes open when you go.
2	This was a 20 minute waste over cooked fish and Chix dirty tables outside .Hey the canned Mtn Dew was 5 Stars . Never been here but go to Kfc next time if you want chix. Harbor Inn or Captains Galley if you want fish. If you want dirty tables to eat on go here...
2	They took over 30 minutes to prepare our food. I asked for my meal to be well done/crispy.  They brought my entree out and it was as soft and white as a baby's behind.  I sent it back. The dish came back darker but not crispy. AndFrustrated, I gave up. My family on the other hand enjoyed their entrees: a sub and a fried food platter.
