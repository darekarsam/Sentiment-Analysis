5	Very happy with Affordable Laser's services and the staff! The location is very easy to find and the staff is very professional.
5	I have been coming to Affordable Laser for over three years now because the staff is so friendly and knowledgeable after I complete one treatment I sign up for another to treat a different area! I have done several laser treatments and rosacea treatment for my face It's been a wonderful experience for me and I would highly recommend them to anyone interested in laser hair removal or skin treatments. Ask for Leda : )
