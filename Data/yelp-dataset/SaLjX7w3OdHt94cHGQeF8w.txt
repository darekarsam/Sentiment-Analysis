1	I agree with the other reviewer.  These people call me, tell me they have worked on my vehicle (even had the make and model which they obviously have gotten off some list as they have NEVER worked on my vehicle before) and then went to tell me that they aren't selling anything and then proceeded to try to sell me something.  Unbelievable.  SCAM!!!!!!!!!
1	When you installed my windshield you broke my chromatic mirror. My receipt shows you as Ultimate Glassworks Novus with same address. I have spoken with you (owner is nasty) and will pursue with all measures at my disposal. The date of the install was 5/17/2011.
1	They just called me again too.  They keep calling and I have told the guy of the bad experience that I had.  I went to the old Indian School location for a windshield replacement.  They have since moved to Cave Creek Road.  Not only did they not hook up my windshield washer line, but I later found that a molding piece was missing.  They either did not re-install it or did it improperly and it blew off.  I was assured a couple of times that they would order the part and call me.....never happened.  I also have been in and spoke to the owner who gave me the same assurances...still SOL .  Poor customer service, yet they still keep calling soliciting my business.    The last call reminded me that I should write a Yelp review
1	This was the asolute worst service I have ever used in my entire life. This will now be the fifth time they are coming to fix my windshield and I doubt they will even show up. The first time, they brought the wrong windshield. The second time there was holes in the seal so there was squealing every time I drove. The third time the holes in the seal got WORSE! Then the fourth time they never showed up, and that was after the manager promised me it would be ready by noon. I feel terribly sorry for any person that chooses them in the future. This place needs to be shut down.
