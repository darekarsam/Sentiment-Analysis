2	The food is good, the place looks good but the attitude of the attendent and the waitress is unacceptable! EVERYTIME I go there they ASK for the tip like if it eas an obligation and if you don't give any or not 15% they yell at you and argue with you! They don't know how to give a good custmer service!
4	Nice looking sushi place with all-you-csn eat or a la carte  options.  Depending on what table you sit at, you can order either a la carte or all you can eat, but not a mixture, so everybody needs to have a similar appetite. To supplement the all you can eat menu items you can order they also have little sushi boats on one of those conveyor belts  that are popular in Japan, but at least when we were there there were not enough clients to assure that the circulating sushi was really fresh. Perhaps as a result,  the circulating plates tend towards highly produced items with fried (tempura) exteriors,  as opposed to simple things like sashimi.
