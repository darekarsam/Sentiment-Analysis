5	I didn't realize that I needed glasses until I had to sign a document and couldn't read the small print. It was urgent that I see an eye doctor. A friend recommended 20/20 Image Eye Centers. They got me in the same day I called. The doctor (Gino) was extremely efficient and answered all of my questions. He told me that once I got my glasses, I would feel better, experience less anxiety, and feel more rested. Apparently, the readers I had were 1/2 of the power that I actually needed. Once the doctor was finished with the exam, I was assisted by Cameron, who was amazing. His attention to detail, and help in picking out the right frames, lenses, etc., made the whole experience a pleasure. Once I picked up my new glasses, Cameron made sure the fit was perfect. I haven't taken them off since. What a difference it has made in my life. From the doctor, to Cameron, the excellent staff, I would highly recommend 20/20 in Fountain Hills to anyone seeking glasses or an eye exam. You will not be disappointed.
