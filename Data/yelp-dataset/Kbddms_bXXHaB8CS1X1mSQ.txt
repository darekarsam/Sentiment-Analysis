3	I've had two tattoos done from there. It's an okay place. One guy messed up one of my tats and went too deep and it blew out. They are not too good on custom work.
5	I have several body piercings and tattoos (not all from this place) but this was a really nice place. "Crispy" did my piercing, he was really professional and nice. The business is clean and informative. I called around prior to coming here and they had the best price and best availability. I'm glad I came here and I'm really happy with my piercing and experience.
1	Went here today at 8:30 to get a piercing (online it says they close at 9) and the doors were locked. A guy comes to the door and said that they closed for the night (30mins early). He was very rude and I will not return. This is after going there to get my belly button pierced last year and it being off centered and crooked. I never should've gave them a 2nd chance after that.
1	Honestly guys? You can do better- I'd bet the only reason it's still up and running is because it's convenintly placed beside campus. Personally, I'm a big fan of good customer service and after a brief visit I found NONE. I was mocked by employees because of the way I look and I was told that the design I wanted HAD to be larger than what I had planned. Guess what? The very next shop I went to finished that same "one-size-too-small" tattoo in less that 45 minutes and it was practically painless. Did I buy anything from here? No. Do I plan to? Hell no. Go somewhere more professional and save yourself the trouble.
