5	If it wasn't for Finlay's this would be the shopping jewel in Portobello High Street's crown. This shop and coffee shop stocks a myriad of gorgeous and unusual food. They stock cheese from Iain Mellis and always have fresh italian and french bread every day. You can pick up vegetarian specialities and gluten free products. They make up great rolls on the spot for you which go down a treat at lunchtimes. They have lovely homebaking, their scones and carrot cake are so very special. On a nice day get a coffee or hot chocolate, read the paper and relax in their comfy sofas.

There's not a lot of competition to this place locally, and it combines a small delicatessen with a cafe in another section of the shop.  I had a good nosey round some of their produce, and it all looked really nice.  Posh looking crisps, jams and marmalades, locally made cakes filled the shelves.  They also had some bread and baked goods, as well as tasty looking meats and cheeses in the chiller.  Combine this with cheery staff, and you have a place that I could happily come back to.I liked the little touches in this place.  For example, on the outside, under the logo it said: "London, Paris, New York."  So, you start thinking that it must be part of a global chain.  Until you read underneath this "are other cities."  I'm sure everyone who reads this when they go in will chuckle to themselves on the inside.  Well, maybe the first time they go in at least.Prices are not cheap, but I'm sure that the quality will justify this.  Nothing like a good deli, and this is a prime example.
