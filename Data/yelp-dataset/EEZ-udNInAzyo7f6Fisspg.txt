5	Awesome people who run and work for this business, booked this trip by chance outside Treasure Island on the strip. Check there website out great !
5	took a little while to get here because of all the other pick ups but once we did get here we were greeted with glasses with champaign. My husband and i along with another couple were first to go. We got to sit in the back which was not a bad view at all. They are so friendly and the helicopter pilot was so informative and funny. seriously the best experience!!!! Definitely a must if it is your first time in vegas or just want a different experience.
5	What a fantastic experience all the way around!!  Spectacular views of the grand canyon and surroundings as well as lots of interesting info from our pilot - he was great! Every single person I talked to from 5 Star was so friendly!  The best part was how everyone went out of their way to make this a special trip for my son, who was celebrating his 21st birthday.  He is disabled and uses a wheelchair.  5 Star even made arrangements for a wheelchair to be waiting for him so he could disembark with  the rest of the passengers when we landed at the west rim mid-tour. I HIGHLY recommend 5 Star Helicopter Tours!!
5	I have done too many adventure tours to count, flown on many helicopters and with many pilots. Today, I had an amazing time with 5 Star on a quick trip to the Grand Canyon from Las Vegas...perfect customer service, real people all the way though, from the hotel pick-to, to check-in, through safety brief (especially) the flight and back to the hotel. 100% first rate, and Victoria is a wonderful person and excellent pilot. Thanks for a perfect day.
