5	Dr Qamar and his incredibly caring staff, both in the Scottsdale office and the Mesa surgical location, all went above and beyond to create a positive experience for my recent cataract surgery. Their kindness, professionalism, and attention to detail was second to none. I highly recommend Dr Tariq Qamar and Q Vision for your vision improvement needs. They don't get any better than Q VISION!!
5	I give great thanks and praise to Dr. Quamar fo his integrity and professional ethics. I have been wearing glasses from morning to night for the last four years and wanted to have lasik surgery knowing that my prescription was minimal. After a thorough examination, Dr. Quamar said that although I was a good candidate for lasik, he did not think that the correction I needed was sufficient to justify the risks involved. (My prescription is .5/.75)  He suggested I take time to see if I can break my unnecessary dependency on my glasses. Any other doctor would have sat me in front of the lazer and taken my money for a surgery I didn't exactly need. I felt awful about wasting his time, but he was only concerned with my well-being. His staff was friendly, and best off all, they don't keep you waiting forever in the lobby. I very highly recommend Qvision for their friendliness and integrity.
