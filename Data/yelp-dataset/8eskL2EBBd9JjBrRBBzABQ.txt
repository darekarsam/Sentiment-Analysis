5	Falafel - Abou HannaCuisine LibanaiseSmall place but amazing Falafel!Right opposite Adonis
5	Have been wanting to try this place for a while and I finally had a chance today.  Very small and intimate setting (nothing fancy), but the food is made with lots of love and care.  Everything is made from scratch by the husband/wife couple who own this joint.  They are very hospitable (as many Lebanese are) and the Falafels were some of the best I've ever tried.  They also make yummy "foul" and "balila" (bean and chickpea dishes)... VERY nutritious!  The price point is also just right.
4	Ever since eating falafel at restaurant Daou a few weeks ago, I've been getting falafel cravings so I booked myself no less than 5 falafel places to visit in the weeks/months to come and this is one of them.Visually it's a small and modest looking place with a small exterior patio to eat on while looking at a busy boulevard. What did we eat? Well, went with what the place was all about... FALAFEL!We ordered a pair each and they were made fresh for us by the kind hospitable staff who invited us to eat outside as the weather was really nice. They were really well done with the right amount of seasonings. The pitas didn't survive long...With some juices we ate 4 falafel pitas for about $16.Ridiculous.Will definitely be coming back!
4	Needed to grab a quick lunch today and was craving good falafel. This place is so good! Real mom and pop place, tiny inside but a small terasse outside so a good option when it's nice out. Falafels are crisp and tasty with delicious toppings: fresh mint, parsley, pickled turnip, lots of ripe tomatoes and tahini sauce with an option to make it spicy by adding a bit of sriracha. And at $2.99, what a bargain! Will definitely be back.
