5	Crazy busy, fast service and friendly, very fresh since its always packed, food doesn't have time to sit at all.  The place is small but surprisingly fits a lot of ppl, it's very cozy and has an outdated diner style that fits the comfort food. There's a nice terrace for the warmer days of the year. Everything ppl next to me ordered looked really tasty and everyone finished their meals. Ppl come from far to eat here from what I hear. I highly recommend this place. It has a lot of regulars and prices are great for the quality and amount of food you get !
5	I read a review of this place some time ago from one of my favorite Yelpers and I immediately bookmarked it. A Mom and Pop comfort food/poutine place? Yes please! And yesterday, the day of reckoning was nigh!It's a pretty easy place is easy to find with plenty of parking (always a good thing!) and their noon rush was pretty obvious yet was managed well. Made my way to the cash and was served immediately by a nice lady. I went with my gut feeling with a regular large poutine. She warns me it's a pretty big plate. I know what I'm about woman.Asks us to seat ourselves and the food will come, so we opted for the open terrace as it was a nice day. We chatted and the food came within 10 minutes. Across the board the service was notably good.So how's the food? The poutine was heavenly. Probably the best I've found off Montreal island for a long long time. The poutine hit all 3 targets it should. The fries were perfect. The curds were extra squeaky and generously spread. And most importantly, the gravy was amazing, the texture was something I really appreciated.All this for a mere $8. This poutine was pretty much one of the biggest plates I've seen. This probably would have cost at least $12-13 if it was on the island of Montreal with a line-up outside the door (like the over-hyped Banquise).All in all, I'm a fan for life. Will definitely be back again.
