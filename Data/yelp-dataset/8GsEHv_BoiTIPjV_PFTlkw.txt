4	I like Staples.  The stores are not crowded during the week which allows me to get in, get what I need, and get out.  That was the case again today.  I needed a new wireless mouse.  A staff member directed me to the location (right in front of the store), I picked out a mouse, paid, and was on my way.  That's how I like it.  They also have a rewards program.  i always use my telephone number for identification because I don't have the thingy that goes on my key chain.  Besides, I don't need any more thingys.
4	Always parking available, clean parking lot, store is never crowded, close to my house. Professional staff.
5	This Staples is close to where I work. It has a great selection of office supplies and it's fun to just browse about if I have time to kill. The employees are friendly and helpful and they have a great pool of knowledge to draw on.
3	Love the rewards, would be nice if the cashiers would smile once in a while. I'll be back for their back to school ads.
