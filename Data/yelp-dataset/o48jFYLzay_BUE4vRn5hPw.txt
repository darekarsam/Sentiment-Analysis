5	American Eagle is amazing! Cute clothes, amazing quality, good prices, and super friendly associates :) heehee
1	This is actually the worst American Eagle I have been to. The standards were fine, but only because it seems that's all they pay attention to. We felt like the associates were allergic to customers. We didn't want to mess up their denim behind the cash wrap but they didn't want to help, despite hearing us struggle and look over from 4 feet away but just kept talking to each other at the counter. I actually had to move out of one of the girls way as she squeezed by me and i was the one who had to say excuse me. Maybe she was mute, im not sure. As we walked to the fitting rooms, 2 of them walked out passed us and back to the registers to chat. We stood there waiting and finally had to walk up and ask for someone to open a door. We both made a purchase, as the whole store was 40% off but I feel like just returning it all.
2	My brother swears by the AE jeans - its what he wears.  They don't work for me.  I will admit I have some nice button down shirts given to me as gifts over the years - that's what I went into look for today.  I went through several shirts and sizes up front, wondered the store a bit, looked at some jeans and other shirts as well.   There were 2 associates on the floor.  Neither acknowledged me in any way shape or form while I was there.  On a visit after this initial review - same exact scenario but I was the only one there on a weekend evening - I was acknowledged by an associate whom I stood in front of and she informed me of their sale going on.  I have shopped there a couple times previously and don't recall a negative experience with service - they just must not be trained to be proactive.
