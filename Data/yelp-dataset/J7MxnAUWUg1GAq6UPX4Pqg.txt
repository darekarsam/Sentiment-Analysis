5	Lucky to have find TJ on yelp. I have a '12 Dodge Durango. I called him to get an automatic start installed. He told me exactly what I needed, how much it would be to install it. And them knocked it out of the park. I tried going to the dealer, a couple big box stores, audio express, and a few other local shops. Total waste of time. Nothing better than a straight shooter. I won't take my cars anywhere else
5	I was thinking old school, best alarm back in the day before viper n all that CRAP...was . Clifford...Well, I went to a few places, and low n behold,,,, they NEVER even heard of Clifford, and,, made me feel like a dumb ass,,,, then they showed me some autopage n viper models for 600+.... OK,,,  I been watching TJ's posts on facebook.. Old school solid work with new and old tech... Called and chatted to him and could tell right away, he knew his stuff, I finally got the money for my project and had TJ install a Clifford alarm, and remove a junk alarm from my new truck... WAY BELOW shop prices... After the GREAT service, I now know where i will go to get my "dream" stereo and custom speaker box,,, Seriously, hard to find GREAT PPL that do great work,,, Thanks TJ .. Hit me up if you want more info,,,
