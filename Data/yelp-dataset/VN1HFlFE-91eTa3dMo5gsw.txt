5	I had a very great experience with doctor Bonn. I got my wisdom teeth taken out today. Dr. Bonn was very professional and explained everything about the procedure in detail. He was clear and concise. His staff got me in, in such short notice and I really appreciated the fact they went out of their way to assist me. I would HIGHLY recommend this location.
5	Found Dr. Bonn here on yelp, with only a couple of perfect reviews I still for some reason had a feeling to go with this office and AM SO GLAD I DID! Michelle was my main contact to book through, I had some slight issues with my insurance company and she patiently helped with clearing that up. I needed an emergency extraction as all 4 of my wisdom teeth had grown in, one had become infected and was causing much pain. They were able to book me very quickly!! Once I arrived I did my X-Rays and assessment same day and Dr. Bonn came in to explain everything about the procedure. He was very clear and welcoming and made me feel at ease immediately. After the procedure I was carried out and driven home after stopping to fill in my prescriptions. To top off the easy and smooth experience I even received a courtesy call from Dr. Bonn himself the next day to ensure my wellbeing.  This office and Dr. Bonn have exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be recommending him to friends and family.
