4	I've just moved back to Charlotte and all my furniture remains in Arkansas. So I need some inexpensive stuff until my wife follows in a few months. Goodwill!Yes, I usually donate (the one on South Tryon was closest to my home then) but this one is now the closest to me. A bit of a challenge to get into and the parking lot is usually full. But the selection and prices make it all worthwhile. The clothing and DVD's are always there and the selection changes on a daily basis. The furniture, on the other hand, is very hit or miss. Sometimes there is stuff there, sometimes there isn't. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not.When I stopped in today, I picked up a good dinette table and a great office chair for under $25. A total bargain!
3	I can only base my review on the drop-off donation ease only, as I have not actually been into the store.I am in agreement with Jeff S.'s review in that it is difficult to get in and out of.  South Blvd is a nightmare on a good day and I am usually dropping items off on my way out of work in the evening, so it's a little worse.The drive-thru drop-off spot is convenient once you are able to turn into the lot.  I have found the staff to be very friendly, they always come out and assist with whatever I am leaving, be it bags of items or furniture.  The have consistently asked if I would like a receipt as well.
