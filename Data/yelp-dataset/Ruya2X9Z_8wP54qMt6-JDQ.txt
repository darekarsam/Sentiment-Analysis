1	Unfortunately , boss and managers are not friendly with client and mostly with their own staff.  I went their for a few years but the constant staff harassment , done in front of patrons is too much.This is summer season with all the tourists they do no cater to the local.  Obviously this is their goal, tourist trap, dont want to deal with localsRude, very rude dont let the place fool you as it is a joke.I'm a local just being treated as a paria, for wanting to give a second chance. NO and also avoid the pasta place next door same owner, bad karma
1	The waitress was very friendly, but the food was definitely disappointing. The place was empty and no wonder, the calamari was old and not cooked properly, super rubbery. It's definitely one of those places that don't even try cause they can get away with just trapping tourists from a very busy street. Please avoid completely!
3	Average, nothing great,nothing bad!! Ordered the chicken and mushroom pizza. Lots of chicken and cheese. Service was mediocre and slow
