5	Lots of chocolate, candy, ice cream and drinks equal a...sugar coma!  Great event!  Lots of fun and something different to do in Charlotte, especially on a cold, rainy Sunday.  My husband and I had a great time tasting all of the sweets!  We used our to-go boxes to bring home some to share with grandparents and our daughter, and still have some left over!  I hope that they decide to have it again because I have a long list of people that want to go with us next time.
4	This was a very well organized event and the addition of swag bags with a to go box to take home what you could no longer manage to eat. Sweets were great. Some better than others of course. It would have been nice to have more variety. Many of the vendors had the same flavors of cupcakes.  There were a couple of twists.  Like the mancake, with bacon and beer. Overall it was s successful event that just needed more variety and imagination. And of course they need more chocolate candy vendors.
4	I found out about this last minute, and could not believe I was so close to missing out on this.  If you've ever met me, you would know that I am one of the biggest sweet tooths on the planet and the concept of having a bunch of the best bakeries in town in one place for the sampling...well you might as well have let me die and go to heaven.The price to get in is a bit steep ($30), but worth it for someone new in town like me so I can get to know some of my future favorites to visit.  The event was well organized and though a lot of the vendors were generic with cupcakes and cookies, there were a few that stood out including the flavored ice cones and the artisan chocolates.I would definitely go again, but next time I would smarten up and take more home rather than trying to eat all that sugar in one night!
