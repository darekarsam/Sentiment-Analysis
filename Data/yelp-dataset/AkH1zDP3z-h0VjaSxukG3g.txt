1	Beware of service sales sharks! I put one star because I got my car back,  otherwise it has been the worst experience in my life. I took the car in for alignment and mechanical inspection.  I ended up paying $60 more than what the service director originally told me and didn't have my car washed. I complained and got an oil change and car wash free for next time.  I would have returned to get that service done but later I found that they changed the windshield wipers that I bough at costco two months ago.  It is my fault for not checking the bill when I paid but I consider dishonest and greety to charge for any type of items they want to get away with.  Also,  in the beginning he mentioned that the engine oil was "black, black, black"  and needed to be changed.  When I told him that it had another 1000km before next oil change,  he first told me he didn't think oil had been changed that soon and later said "well it not doing bad,  but we still need to change it because we're fixing the VVT". I really don't trust people like that and I will never come back ti the dealership anymore.
1	extremly rude service, their regular checkups could NOT find any of the real problems, only by guessing and trying to let customers replace every single part related.sucks big time.
3	Have had good and bad experiences with the service, but this is my car dealer and I prefer to be with them. The problem is when your car is out of warranty, the attention somehow decreases and the maintenance becomes expensive. However, the staff is friendly and the location is convenient.
