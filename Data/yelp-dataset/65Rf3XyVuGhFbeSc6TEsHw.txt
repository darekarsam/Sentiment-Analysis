5	Wonderful salon!  I have been using Amy Yoakum as a stylist for years.  She's talented, efficient, and friendly.  She offers a wide range of services and is a joy to be around.  She listens to her clients and her prices are reasonable.
5	I found myself once again searching for a stylist that could actually oh I don't know? STYLE!! I searched, and searched, called and called, explained and explained. Then I came across "The Standard". I noticed that the building happened to be one of the salons that I have already tried, only the name changed. I read some reviews and thought I would give it a shot as everyone else I called wanted to charge me by the hour and due to my luck in the past, that scared me. Then my luck changed. I was put into contact with an angel turned hair goddess named Jamie. From the get go I knew I had found someone extraordinary. I walked in today with multi colored pink hair and a VERY specific look I wanted to achieve. To be honest, Jamie put that look to shame. For the first time in 5 years I was crying because I was so happy instead of crying because I was ashamed of my hair. Jamie is amazing. My hair is amazing. I will never go anywhere but to her. If you're reading this chances are you really care about the stylist you're about to choose to style the focal point of you're whole style. Go ahead and stop researching because you have now found the best out there. Do your hair and you're self esteem a favor, book with Jamie.
