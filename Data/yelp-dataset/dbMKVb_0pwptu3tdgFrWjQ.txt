1	KFC has seriously gone down hill .WAYY over priced .will stick with Churchs chicken from now on
2	I really do try to shy away from giving bad reviews but this place is just horrible! I've tried this location 3 times in the last year and it was a horrible disappointment each time. Badly dried out chicken from sitting under the heat lamps way too long, failing to mention that they are out of gravy until you come back to complain that you didn't receive any with your order, and the most annoying drive thru window in the valley! I hate sounding like a redneck bigot but the young lady taking orders from the drive thru should be required to speak at least a little English! I have no interest in learning how to speak Spanish just so my order is correct from KFC and I don't have to repeat my order several times before she just resorts to guessing what the hell I want and throwing it in a bag!
1	I love KFC, but this location is horrible. I stopped by on 7/21/14 and bought 2 meals. The chicken was dry and way overcooked. They really need to get some workers in there that know how to cook. I have been going to this location for several years now, and the first few times the chicken was awesome (about 3 years ago), but it has gone downhill since then. The other location that went downhill closed last year (105th / Indian School). I really hope the corporation looks at these reviews and attempts to solve the problems, because KFC is our favorite place for chicken. I gave 1 star for the side dishes.
1	Pretty sure I'm not invisible, but appear to be to the Friday night crew at this particular KFC. Stood there for what seemed to be an eternity, then left to go to Popeyes. Should have known better, this location is just aweful. Should rename themselves KFuC.
