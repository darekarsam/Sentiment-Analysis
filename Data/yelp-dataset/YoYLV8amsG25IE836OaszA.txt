5	Jeff is a great guy! Awesome service, great choices, plenty of selections, great prices. This is my second time in, and i will never go any where else!
2	I will not be going to CU again. The owner seems to follow you like a hound and is very pushy. Thinks he knows everything. I returned my stuff and went elsewhere (FX Tactical) and he had a tad snappy attitude and was butt hurt about it. The selection is good, but if you want a much better selection of combat gear go two blocks north.
5	Jeff is a great guy... I don't know what that other review was about. He is the nicest guy and try's to help you out as much as he can.  The selection is great and he will order you whatever you want. I will keep coming back over and over
