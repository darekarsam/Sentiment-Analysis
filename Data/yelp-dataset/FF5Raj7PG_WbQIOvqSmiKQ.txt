5	Best place in southern Charlotte for a Men's haircut, full barber spa treatment, my stylist Liz is up to date on all of today's men's styles, weather your a rock god or a businessman she's got you covered, this place is defiantly a hidden gem!
5	I had a great experience Liz cut my hair and did an amazing job! She was very nice the salon was in a very interesting old building but it added to my great experience. I highly recommend her for men's hair cuts!
