3	Wave really is a cool place. The theme of the store makes me feel, well, like a famous person. And I like that! There's tons of great merchandise and a decent shoe selection, most of which are reasonably priced. What really gets me is that the left half of the store is for plus-size women. Again, half of the store is the same great flashy fashion in larger sizes. How great is that? I love that they really go out of their way to have something for ever customer.
1	HORRIBLE HORRIBLE customer service!! The staff are unapproachable and not friendly at all! I went to go back to EXCHANGE a dress that I'd purchased the day before for a smaller size. The associate told me she could not exchange it for me because they have a no return policy for dresses. I asked to speak to a manager and she told me that my receipt was stamped final sale so she could do nothing to help me. Let me add that the associate who rang me up for my purchase never TOLD me that their dresses could not be exchanged or I never would have made the purchase before trying it! Let me end by saying, as a retail manager myself, I do not appreciate the way I was treated as a first time customer and STAMPING the receipt before telling me the return policy is both DECEPTIVE and UNETHICAL!!! My advice to other consumers? Don't waste your money on this poorly run business....
