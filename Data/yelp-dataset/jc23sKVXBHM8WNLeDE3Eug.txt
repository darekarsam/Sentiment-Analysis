4	Graham's is tucked away among a few other stores that I rarely ever visit. The few times I have gone to Graham's the folks have always been very nice and have introduced me to a few different fatty and sugary treats that we all crave now and again. Each product I have had has always been tasty and fresh. I will come back once I work off the extra calories from my most recent visit.
1	If you want to be completely ignored when you walk into a business, then this is the place for you. I walked into this bakery at 4:40PM. There were 2 customers ahead of me and 2 ladies behind the counter. One was waiting on the customers while the otherseemed to be more interested in getting the place ready for closing at 5:00PM andsocializing with someone who walked in after me and was obviously just visiting the lady. The other lady finished with her customer and then walked back to the back of the store and they both completely ignored me for a good 5 minutes while I was waiting by the cake case too buy a cake. Ten minutes later I finally asked them exactly how much longer they were going to ignore me and walked out. I them came back to ask for the owner's name and was told it was Ron. Well Ron, this incident cost you $17.99 which I was going to spend on a Tiramasu cake and also lost you a good customer. I also plan to tell my family and friends NOT to shop here. TERRIBLE SERVICE.
1	Extremely rude lady works there on Sundays.  Called at 1:50 p.m.and wanted to pick up a cake for my daughter's birthday.  I was told that they had cakes available but to hurry because they close at 2:00 p.m. sharp.  I arrived at 1:58 p.m. and the rude lady would not let me in.  She kept pointing to the clock.  Pool customer service.  I will NEVER go back.
