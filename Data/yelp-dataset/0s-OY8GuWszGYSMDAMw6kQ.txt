5	I always order online which is so easy on convenient.  My order is alway ready when I get there.  My order is always fresh and accurate.  The taste is much better than the competitors.
5	This locations is our delivery location. They have been delivery our pizza for the past two years. I just wanted to compliment them for excellent service! We place all our orders online and they are deliver to us within 30-40 minutes. The pizza is always fresh and taste the way its supposed to taste. This is the best Papa John's location + service I've ever experience since they've been in business.
5	Got to give a shout out to my favorite pizza delivery place. The pizza is good - cooked the way I order and the delivery people are friendly and fun! I order online from this location at least once a month - Great job guys! Thank you!
4	What can one say?  This is a great franchise, tightly managed for quality and consistency.  Get a pie in Charlotte or Chula Vista, it will be the same.  Cleanliness is also a by-word with Papa John's.  The stores are immaculate.  and the preparation areas are similarly kept up.  When you walk in, you know you are getting a "clean" pie.  And where you have delivery, it arrives hot and not with the toppings slid to one side or the other because it was transported on a level surface.I especially like the insulated bags that can carry it looks like 5 boxes.  The franchise is also community oriented, both nationally with their support of NFL charities, but also locally.  The founder is a serious Catholic, consequently will not allow support of any anti right-for-life organizations or events.  (Did I get that politically correct without the "A" word?)Good pizzas at reasonable prices.  Look for frequent promotions and remember to ask as you buy your pies if there are any discounts, like for seniors or military, let alone advertisements of which you forgot to bring with you. ;-))
