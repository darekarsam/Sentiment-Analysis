5	Michael in firearms was the best!Knowledgeable and friendly.  Helped pick the best option.
5	Just... wow! So many guns. So much ammunition. So much hunting gear. So much outside gear. Not just camo hats and overalls, but there are workout clothes, running and hiking shoes, boots, and more camping gear than you can possibly shake a stick at.I took a brief peruse of the shooting equipment and was really impressed. The long guns and pistols were well stocked and reasonably priced. Everything from Kahr to Remington to Smith & Wesson and in between. Tons of accessories including targets, cleaning equipment, gun safes and gun vaults. As for the ammunition - CHEAP. There's been a big run-up in ammo prices lately, but you wouldn't know that from shopping at Gander. Wow.Love this store. I suspect I'll be buying from here a bit.
3	Decent ammo selection and prices, but that's the best I can say. It took an hour to complete a simple handgun purchase, with a CCW permit, and the whole time the sales guy was pushing their upgraded warranty. Look, if this bozo can't find the serial number on a revolver, no way I'm going to let them work on my gun.
4	On of the Large Gander Mountain store I've Been too.  They have a huge selection of clothing and outdoor sporting equipment.     If you need to shop for a handgun, this place had a ridiculous amount for you to choose.  The entire back glass wall was almost filled with them.  Ammo seems to becoming back in stock slowly and they had several large case of .223 and natio rounds.  I am still unable to find anywhere that carries 22 long rifle at a normal price, they didn't have any here.   Huge array of fishing gear, but no fly fishing stuff. They were mainly setup for lake and sea fishing. Only thing lacking here was a massive array of dead animals to look at( I might have missed them), which all the gander mountains and outdoor shops displayed. The staff was friendly and helpful.
