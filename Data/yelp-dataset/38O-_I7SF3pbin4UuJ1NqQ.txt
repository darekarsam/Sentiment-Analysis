5	Kiko Cruz is one talented guy. I'm a local photographer and I have worked with him on several photo shoots from simple business head shots to elaborate, high fashion portraits. He can definitely do it all and his attention to detail is impeccable. Kiko is very professional, easy going and makes my clients feel at ease no matter what we are about to photograph. I presented a  photo concept to him for a fashion editorial, and he came up with the coolest updos and because of him, my photos were outstanding. He is a true artist and works magic with color too! Kiko is your go to man for everything hair and I would highly recommend him.

5	I am an always changing client! Kiko has always been able to direct and bring focus to the best style and cut for me with just the few things I tell him about what I want at that moment and he gives me the cut and color that I envisioned..He listens, and what makes him special is that he puts so much energy into making sure you leave his chair not only a satisfied client...but also a repeat client! He's that good you'll want to come back for more!
5	kiko is an amazing artist. My hair was long and in need of an "attitude adjustment". I gave a vague direction for my new style and Kiko brought it full circle. When I looked in the mirror for the first time after Kiko completed the cut, I was amazed! He created a master piece!! Thank you Kiko for being such a talented hair designer! I love my new do!
