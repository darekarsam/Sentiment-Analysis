2	I used to love Bob & Sheri, but now they have more music and commercials during their chat room than actual callers.  It is hard to believe that people actually hold on the line for 15 minutes!  This is incredibly rude and having 60 minutes commercial and music free would make this show better.
4	I gotta hand it to these guys.  To still be this funny after all these years is quite an accomplishment.  Granted they're geared to a more grown-up audience (not in raunchy terms) but they're fun to listen to.  If you've got teens in the car they might moan and groan about it, but they can keep you entertained during a long rush hour.  They're like old friends that, unlike SOME old friends, you STILL want to hear from after all these years.
