4	This place is a quick thai take out.  They have about 10 different options, and each option has a sub-option of meat/sauce.  For example, they have Pad Sew, Pad Thai, Fried Rice, Stir Fry, General's chicken, etc.  You can compliment your meal with a spring roll, and a soda.  Average price out the door with meal, drink and spring roll is approximately $11, and a good value for food quantity.The problem is that this establishment is only open for lunch, and is in a food court.  You have 2 option for eating: take out or eat in the food court.  If you eat in, don't expect free refills on your soda (this applies to every restaurant in the food court).
4	I came to this place twice in four days, its that good.  I had the general thai and really enjoyed the fresh taste of the food. It had onions, peppers, and pineapples, with chicken.  They make it right in front of you and it takes about 3-4 minutes.  Only issue is when it gets really busy you might have to wait up to 10 minutes, which is frustrating if you are looking for fast food.  Loved the food!!
