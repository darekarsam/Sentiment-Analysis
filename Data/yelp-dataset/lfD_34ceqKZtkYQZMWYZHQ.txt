3	This is the Canadian Tire store on Victoria Street in Kitchener.  This store is quite small relative to the store at the Sunrise Centre across town, and does often run out of items when the big sales are occurring.  However, the staff here has always been very happy to help and have taken the time to assist me in locating what I am looking for, even if it means looking on their store system to search another location because they don't have any available.
3	This is a smaller (compared to the giant big box stores they have now), more cramped version of the Canadian Tire store.People are quite helpful and they have just about everything in this store. We had a bit of a hard time finding what we were looking for, but found it eventually.There's decent parking out front and a hot dog cart!
2	Very small with a less than average selections of products. It's worth the extra drive to another location in Kitchener to get what you want.
