1	I think it's pitiful that this place has hired a bunch of girls with bad attitudes.  DO NOT go to this place to get your eyebrows done, honestly you will get nothing but negative energy from the girls who work there.  No personally connection with their customers because they don't want nothing to do with you, just bad energy.  Very cold and unprofessional.  It seems like they don't even want to be there, just very bad customer service... WARNING STAY AWAY!!
2	I went here for quite awhile and was always satisfied with their service. One day last summer, I walked in and saw the same lady that always did my eyebrows (I never knew her name). As we were talking, she (for whatever reason) felt the need to inform me I had put on weight and asked me if I was pregnant. I couldn't even believe her. I walked out in tears and to this day am shocked she has a job in customer service.
3	I came here b4 with my friend but this time it was for me.I had my eyebrows threading done here and it was not painful and quick.the only reason I am not giving it a 5 star coz the lady was not friendly much.i felt cold whatever behavior from her.
4	Normally I come here and the girls barely say a few words to me. Not the friendliest customer service, but they do a good job. Today I had a sweet lady named Sakila and she was wonderful. She complimented me on my brows, which always makes a woman feel good. We chatted for a but and she even said goodbye as I walked out, while working on the next customer. I wish it was less than $12 for eyebrows but I don't get them done much anyways.
