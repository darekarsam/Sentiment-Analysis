4	It's amazing to truly find an HONEST auto mechanic. I was told by a "instant lube " place about a leak and when bringing my vehicle to JCJ they told me that the lube place was full of it. Charlie has saved my butt plenty of times. He is quick to diagnose the problem and usually never charges you to look at it and tell you what the issue is. They will even tell you if its something that can wait to be fixed. This establishment has proven to me over & over again that they can be trusted in provideing quality work. They charge me only what is fair (considerably lower than most chain places) and once reduced his labor costs so that the bill wasnt so high.His office is a little dirty and shady looking but apparantly they care more about quality work than pretty offices and i appreciate that!!!!!!
5	Me and my dad have been coming to this shop for years now for any repair or honest opinion which they have ALWAYS provided at a good price. recently I was in need of a new vehicle and decided to see what they had for sale. I was able to get into an excellent car!  It was hassle free and they give great deals on their vehicles for sale!  Best part is you know that those cars are in tip top shape because they have fixed anything that may have been wrong! They really work with you to make sure you're happy as well.  Definitely recommend.
5	I absolutely agree with the positive reviews, including the two 'not recommended' reviews that were positive, but forgot to put the stars. Charlie will never recommend that you need a service until you absolutely need it. If he can save you money, he will. These guys are extremely honest and trustworthy. I highly recommend them! In the past 10 years I can't even tell you how many times they have saved me.
