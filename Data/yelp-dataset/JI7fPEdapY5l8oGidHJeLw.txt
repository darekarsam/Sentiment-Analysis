5	Having three daughters who compare what they get, I like to order my flowers the same but just enough different that they know they were picked for them, and they have been creative and very helpful. I have never been disappointed with their service.  I live out of town and have been made to feel like I was in the store picking the flowers I want.  They are happy to oblige. I highly recommend them.
5	I went in without an order Richard and Genine were very helpful and friendly. They custome made me a floral arrangement in 10min it looked fantastic. I was very happy.
1	Sign out front says open to 2 pm Sundays. 1:30 and you are closed. 1 star. If you are going to post hours, stick to them. You suck.
5	I went in Friday to order flowers for a funeral on Monday. Around midnight, Saturday night, it hit me that I gave the wrong date and the funeral was actually Sunday morning, ten hours away! In a panic I called and left a message on how I screwed up the days. Richard called me at 8am and told me he was already at the store preparing to deliver my flowers because he had called the funeral home to confirm the date and they told him the right one. I'm extremely happy he took the extra step of actually confirming the funeral date so that my flowers got there on time!
