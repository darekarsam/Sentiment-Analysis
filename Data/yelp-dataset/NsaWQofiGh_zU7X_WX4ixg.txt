5	very efficient service,  staff was nice, i didnt have to wait 2 hours like at a repair shop. my smog was done in 5 minutes :) would recommend this place 100%
5	The young man working there today was really really nice. From start to finish the whole process was maybe five minutes. At the end when he ran my debit card and I got the slip back asked if there is somewhere to tip. He said that it was too late and not to worry about it. I felt really bad and I said are you sure we can run it again, and he said the fact that I came in was plenty enough with a warm smile. Overall really really nice guy clean facility, will be going back again next year.
5	I am very excited to have found Issac and the Smog Box for my car service and repairs.  Issac has performed an emissions check, emission system repairs and routine maintenance on my vehicle.  Each time I have been there, I have found him to be very professional, friendly and proficient.  The pricing is very fair and I have been recommending the Smog Box to everyone I know.
1	The food was ok , one of the black male servers was in a prissy mood rolling his eyes, cutting off people as they spoke and even walking away as he was being spoke too , The bartender must actually own the place by the way he was talking about the patrons to other servers , he was bad mouthing customers that got seated before he could serve the cocktails and badmouth the patrons because they where walked to their table and didn't leave a tip , but bitched loud enough for everyone to hear. The spark is gone from this place , it felt like it was just a large high school click and they had no management watching over them by the way the servers held their emotions on their sleeves , this isn't the first time , my family and I have experience this with these emotional servers , but it will be the last.Yeah I wrote this about a different Business establishment this was not meant for the smog Business
