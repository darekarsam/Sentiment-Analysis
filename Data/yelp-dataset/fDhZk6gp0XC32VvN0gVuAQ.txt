4	plenty of veggie and vegan yumm goodies and so much more than you could imagine them fitting in
3	Not the cheapest local shop but has a good range of products and often does wine deals to compete with the multiple's. Margiotta's is great for picking up last minute items and has a great range of salads and dinner items. Not so great for gluten free foods (no bread) but some of their indian range (pakoras/bahjis) are gluten free and they stock Mrs Crimbles coconut cookies if looking for a quick fix.
