4	Located in the Target/Kohl's shopping center inside Target.
3	For only manning this booth with one employee, the girl behind the counter was doing her best.I usually find Starbucks to be too sugary if it is not a Pike's Peak coffee or an Americano. On our visit to Target, my sister and I got the Hibiscus Refresher. It was the right amount of sweetness and was very refreshing. Just don't eat the blackberries. They were not so good.
5	I try to visit here once every Friday in order to get my mid-afternoon/evening coffee fix.I love how nice it is to have a Starbucks inside of Target, let alone have very nice and hard working individuals who are helpful!
5	You can never go wrong with Starbucks. Even tho I don't like or drink coffee I still come here for their yummy refreshing teas.Baristas here are very nice. They are pretty fast too compared to some other locations I've been to.Sign up for a Starbucks Reload able card. After you get 30 stars you will become a Gold member.  As a Gold member you will get a personalized card with your name on it mailed to you and great perks. Maintain at least 30 stars per year to keep your gold member status.Located in Target. Drink and shop at the same time.  Ask the barista for a cup holder clip that clips directly on to your target shopping cart to hold your drink for you while you shop. Great idea hehe
5	As another reviewer said, this Starbucks is located inside Target. The cashier was cheerful, informative and greeted people properly. A minor thing of note, decor was a cross between Starbucks and Target with lots of red and orange colors, not that it mattered but it looked a little strange. Coffee was good, as expected.
