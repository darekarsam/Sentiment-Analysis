5	What a wonderful photoshoot by Jenna to celebrate our engagement - the pictures are so stunning, and we will treasure them forever. As well as being a fantastic artist, Jenna has that rare mix of being both professional and personable, which completely sets you at ease. Wholeheartedly recommended.
5	An amazing photographer.  Both friendly and professional.  I love the pictures and had a lot of fun during the shoot!
5	Excellent job at both our maternity session and newborn session. Was great with our baby too! And the album- perfect! Book her, you won't be disappointed :)
5	We were nervous/excited about getting our engagement photos taken because we weren't sure how awkward it would be. Needless to say, we were pleasantly surprised at how easy it was, and I know it was due to how at ease Jenna put us. She was really great to shoot with and the images were breathtaking! I'm running out of places to display them at our house. Cannot wait for her to do our wedding! Her imagery is simple and romantic and she really has a gift for capturing the moment.
5	Jenna has a true gift for capturing the moment! She is fun, talented, patient and passionate about what she does and it is reflected in her work. I am always blown away by the work she does. She really makes you feel at ease during a session if you're not used to having your photo taken by a professional. I loved the photos she captured of my boyfriend and I at the lake near our house and I'm really looking forward to having her take my graduation photos in the coming months. Jenna is fantastic and never disappoints!
