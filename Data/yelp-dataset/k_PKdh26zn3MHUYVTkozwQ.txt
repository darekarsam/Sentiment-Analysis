5	Dr. Heffner actually makes getting shots in my face fun!  She is an artist with those things!
5	Dr. Karlee Heffner makes things easy and painless! She makes you feel right at home and also has the best prices around without sacrificing quality work and quality products. You won't find a better place!
5	Dr. Heffner has been treating me for about 3 years now, and she is AMAZING! I'm a huge baby when it comes to any kind of pain, and she is so gentle and caters to my "senstivity."  She knows exactly where and how to inject and keeps you looking natural. My boyfriend had no idea I did botox the first 2 years of our relationship! Her level of skill, knowledge and compassion is unbeatable!  You need this woman in your life!
5	Dr. Heffner is the absolute best! I will never go to anyone else. She makes it simple fast and painless! She's so sweet and makes it fun to go there rather than dreading it! She is overall AMAZING! Makes everyone look gorgeous, and best price I've seen for the work she does.
5	Dr Heffner is awesome. I would highly recommend her and will be back to her office soon. Let's just say, I leave her office looking very "refreshed" everytime!
5	I go to Dr. Heffner for  juvederm and restylane. She is very thorough and patient. You can tell she cares and wants her patients to be completely satisfied. I was very nervous and scared about getting injections but Dr. Heffner took her time to answer my questions. If you aren't sure about getting injections, schedule a consult, then you will realize this is the place to go.
5	Great place to get your skin care needs.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Sam goes above and beyond to make sure clients are satisfied.  Great place for botox and B12 injections.  I hear they do amazing work with Juvederm fillers as well.  I am very picky, and I like this place!
