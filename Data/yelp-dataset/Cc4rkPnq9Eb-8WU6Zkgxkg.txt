5	Friendly service, very helpful and reliable.I had a problem with roof rats. They came around blocked all the holes they could find with wire mesh and set bait traps around the house - plus they gave me plenty of advice.Roof rats have gone from the house and they have been very reliable on their monthly visits.Highly recommended
5	These guys are the best.  It all started when we had a roof rat in our attic.  They sealed up our house right away to prevent it from happening again and got that sucker!  My neighbors used them too and after setting up bait stations no rats for the last year!  We have been using them for over 4 years.  They come every month and check with me to see if I have had any problems.  They are very honest and fair in their pricing.  Plus they are a locally owned company.  It doesn't get any better than that. If I ever have a problem they are on it.
5	I have been using their service for years and referring to friends.  Most recently our Dishwasher wasn't working.  An appliance guy showed up and said a rodent had eaten through a rubber supply line so we called Jim.  Within 2 hours a tech was onsite and looked at the hose.  The hose was simply off where it was supposed to be because the clamp broke.  No sign of rodents at all.  Their customer service is prompt, professional, and very fair rates.  I would never think of hiring anyone else.
