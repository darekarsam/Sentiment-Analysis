5	Fantastic place, nice people, awesome food, great atmosphere. It's a newer-age tapas bar with a James Bond and 1960s Turkish chic theme. The menu inclues tapas that range from curry chicken to steak tartare as well as a gourmet poutine.
5	Bond is excellent. Very cool vibe. James Bond theme is subtle, not over the top. Lots of good looking people. Drinks were fantastic and food was top notch.
3	Cool bar. I'm not sure I would go back? The food was ok. Friendly staff. Nicely designed bar. I don't think a place like this should have a tv but that's just my opinion. There was a really cool advertisement like mirror/monitor thing over the urinal that just impressed me, but that might have been the rum;)
4	Very chill vibe. Food is delicious. The decor is classy. A good place to enjoy drinks, a meal and good company.
1	Worst bar experience! First, the server couldn't mix a drink that wasn't on their special martini menu (note to proprietor: a bartender knows how to make classic drinks without a manual).  The weird food laws that necessitate ordering food with every order is ridiculous and sounds like a scam.  Also, as a fellow food service worker it is a huge faux pas to tell your patrons to tip for poor service and a lack of mixology knowledge, go back to Tim Horton's.
