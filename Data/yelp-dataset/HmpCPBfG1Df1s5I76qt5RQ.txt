4	What you get at Joyfully Curly is a solid knowledge of curly hair and a skillful application of that knowledge:  in other words, she knows what she's doing and your hair will reflect that. Excellent color (I forget it's not mine at times). :-)She uses the Deva curl technique, if you're familiar with Lorraine Massey and the Curly Girl book.Not a big salon with lots of drama and mugs of herbal tea, or even music (or Muzak) :-). But if you have curly hair, put it on your list.
4	I've had my hair colored and cut at Joyfully Curly a number of times and I've never been anything but completely happy with the results.  After moving to Huntersville fro Long Island, NY last year, I searched for a salon that specialized in curly hair and found Joy at Joyfully Curly and I'm so happy that I did.  I have had my hair cut in Mantattan, NY at places such as Fredrik Fekkai and DevaShan, and believe me, Joy knows her curly hair!  You get the same Deva technique I got in the big fancy New York City salons in a friendly surrounding.  So if you have curly hair and are looking for a place to trust your hair....run, dont walk to Joyfully Curly and let Joy pamper your curls!
3	I went here hoping for the best hair cut of my life! Curly hair is such a mystery, and as any curly girl would know, we will try anything. once. I got a ton of knowledge about curly hair, and how it should be treated, cut, washed...etx.  That was probably my favorite part, learning about my hair and curl type. But as far as the hair cut itself I do not know if I loved it. Especially for $100. I think I would only try this again if I was in New York, I've heard good things about curly salons there, and seen before and afted YouTube videos. I havent been back to Joyfully Curly.
