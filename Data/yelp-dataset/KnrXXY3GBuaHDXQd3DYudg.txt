5	John Rader has been managing my personal and corporate finances for the past decade. John is one of my favorite people on earth. Not only is he very well versed in tax law/accounting, but he is also a very sweet, caring soul making him an absolute pleasure to do business with! John has also gone on to manage the finances for my ENTIRE FAMILY because of the superior job he has done for me in this area of my life.The ground floor office for Coffey & Rader is easily accessible from Sahara with plenty of parking right out front. The office itself is a very happy, comfortable environment. Natalie (Office Manager), is a long time employee of the firm who is an absolute pleasure as well!I WOULDN'T TRUST MY FINANCIAL AFFAIRS IN ANYONE ELSE'S HANDS!!! PERIOD.
1	John Rader was my CPA for the past five years. I trusted him and referred him to many others. I am very conservative with my taxes and they are not very complicated. Within the last year I have been contacted by the IRS on two occasions for mistakes he made on my taxes from years back. Now I'm paying penalties and have a huge tax bill to pay. Additionally, I have asked him to resolve the mistakes (which he admitted to). His resolutions have been declined by the IRS each time. Just a warning, he may not have always been on his game, and you might want to have a professional review your taxes from previous years. My apologies to anyone I referred to him.
