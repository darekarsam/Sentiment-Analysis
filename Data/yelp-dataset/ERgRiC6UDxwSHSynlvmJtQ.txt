3	This place was not what I expected.  It is a huge open space with a large bar stuck right in the middle.  The menu is more upscale than the usual sports 'bar' selections, but I guess that is the difference between sports bar and sports grill?The food was good, but if I remember correctly they had little to no draft beer.  They could have had Bud or Coors or something, but to me that translates to no beer on tap.  They have a lot of flat screen tvs as they should,  but I like a little bit more character in my sports bar.  This is much too commercial for my taste.
4	well, this is certainly not my style of bar, but it's about 500 feet from my apartment, so  i find myself here a lot.i would prob give it only three stars were not for two things: a bike rack out front - total, unexpected score, and TVs in the bathrooms; excess at its finest.it's definitely trying to cater to the more "distinguished" sports fan, and looks like a more contemporary and i hesitate to say, upscale, bar.there is NO beer on tap. ket me repeat, NO BEERS ON TAP.  which i don't understand for a sports bar... no pitchers? weird. they do have about six import/nicer beers in a bottle, like bass and heineken, and i believe fat tire is $3 all the time. the long islands are on special for $3 at HH, and are big and tasty.there is a large, fours-sided bar right in the middle, and lots of tables (both regular height and bar stool height) inside. on the covered patio is a fire pit, pool table and three very large TVs. also inside are two private rooms with their own TVs, couches and tables that can be reserved, i think at no extra charge.service is spotty, and take it that it's because i'm no where near what the young, pretty things that serve it up here are looking for in an ideal customer, so perhaps i don't really warrant as much attention as that group of guys wooping it up while watching the game.i agree the food is definitely overpriced for what it is.
