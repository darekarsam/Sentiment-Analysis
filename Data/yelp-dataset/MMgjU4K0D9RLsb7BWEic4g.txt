5	I cannot tell a lie! GULP. When the urge for a fast, hot pizza happens...and I'm in the area...I give Domino's a call or order online.  It may not be gourmet pizza...but dang it!  The new cheesy bread (which is on special for $5.99 if you order two or more...not that I have recently...) is pure salty, cheesy, flavorful goodness.  It really hits the spot when you're starving and want something utterly not good for your waistline. I also think their new pizza recipe is pretty good. I like this location because I've never had a problem with the service.  They're always on time when estimating how long it'll take for your order to be ready.  Keep in mind, busy times, like Friday nights or weekends can be super busy, and delivery may take awhile, so plan ahead. Okay, I'm going to hide my head under the table now...and enjoy my slice.
5	THIS location is the best! I do not know about other Domino's locations, however, this one is utterly fantastic! First let me say, the price for a large 3 topping carryout is superb - only $8.65 compared to $12 (and change) for a xtra large ONE topping from Papa John's. I'd never thought I'd see the day where I'd say that Domino's is better than Papa John's but this pizza I had on this day was DELICIOUS - some of the best pizza I have ever, if not the best, had! The young lady, Jennifer, I believe, has to be one of the best pizza makers there is - OMG! Kudos! When I want pizza - this is the place from now on at the Park Rd Locale!
