5	I already frequent grapevine Wineshop and Winebar on a regular basis.  The owners are good people, and they have a great selection of local and craft beer, even on tap and allowed to be filled in growlers.  They do a great job with Beertopia, now in its 4th year.  Although the line to get in was wrapped around a residential street for a couple of blocks, they got everyone in quickly.   Two York County sheriffs were there to check id, and several volunteers were taking the tickets, issuing wristbands, and distributing the two ounce sample cups.  There were quite a bit of breweries, beer, and food, plus the local cover band U-phonik rocking the tunes.  The highlight was actually my friend Cindy C. rocking out with them for the Beastie Boys "Sabotage."  All in all, grapevine put on another great event.  It was nice to see all the taxi cabs leaving - responsible drinkers.  As Jeff mentioned it's not far from Charlotte proper, 5 miles south of the line on 77 or 5 miles from Steele Creek down 160, and less than 15 minutes from Ballantyne down the back roads.
