4	This place moved to this location. All of the reviews disappeared from the other location. The food is very authentic peruvian food. Recommend the Lomo saltado or the Seco de Carne. Or any seafood dish. Also try one of the many unique appetizers. My mom was Peruvian,  so  I crave this food.
4	New location  but same great people and food!! Might be a little pricey but well worth it. As a Peruvian myself I can tell you this is the real deal so come and try it!!!
2	I just ate here for the first time a couple of weeks ago, at the new location. I definitely had higher expectations for this place that it did not come close to meeting.The food seems great for hangovers, but if you are not sporting one then you will probably think very little of the food like I did. It is also grossly overpriced. The food portions are regular and you will not have any leftovers to bring home. Our meal started off with the Huancaina con Camaron...which is described well on the menu. It is a boiled potato with one small slice of boiled egg on top. A few small overcooked and shelled shrimp. $9. They must make a ton of money charging people $9 for 1 potato and a few small shrimp. I ordered the Saltado de Camarones and my boyfriend ordered the Tallarin Salteando de Carne. My plate was french fries with a bunch of onions and some more small shrimp on top. $16. They did not bring out the correct plate for my boyfriend (which the waitress even recommended to us)...instead they brought him Lomo Saltado which was the same thing as mine but with a few strips of beef (on top of french fries and onions). $12. I do not recommend this spot unless you have a hangover and money to throw at basic food. We will not be returning. The only reason this spot got the 2nd star is because the waitress was nice.
