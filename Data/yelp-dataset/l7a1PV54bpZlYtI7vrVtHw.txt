1	Rude! I ordered a simple pizza and when it was wrong the manager ANN said I was lying and refused to admit she could be wrong at all. Then she got nasty and aggressive and told me she wasn't going to eat the lose of one pizza and hung up on me. Just avoid this place and go to any of the other pizza places in dormont. Ps. Ann stop wearing a choker that went out of style in 94'
4	I ordered delivery from here today. Overall it was a pleasant experience.  I called to ask about their restaurant.com deal.  You can only use that for carry out but he was nice enough to give me a coupon code, $3.99 (coupon code 400) off a large one topping pizza for delivery.  I ordered half sausage half spinach.  The toppings were fresh, dough was nice and soft, and delivered quickly!  It was delicious.  Nice change from the other pizza delivery options around here! They have a restaurant.com deal going on right for $10 for $4 or $25 for $10 only for carry out!
