5	This the most beautiful, interesting cemetery I've ever been to, including the fancy ones in New Orleans.  I was showing off Pittsburgh to my Texas boyfriend and had to bring him here.  It was a beautiful fall day, and this place is huge, with a pond, nice big oak trees, rolling hills and all different types of simple to ostentatious gravestones.  Like many cemeteries, families are grouped together.  There are many large, impressive mausoleums, with stained glass windows and rod iron detailing.  It is easy to get lost walking among the families and cultures and hundreds of years of lives that are memorialized here.  I think it is the most beautiful park in Pittsburgh.  It is a great place to walk and wander among the trees and leaves and gravestones by yourself or with an appreciative partner.
