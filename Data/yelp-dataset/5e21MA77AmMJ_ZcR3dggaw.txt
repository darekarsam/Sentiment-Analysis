5	Lake Farm County Park is a great spot only 10 minutes from downtown.  The park is huge (328 acres) and borders Lake Waubesa.  There are campsites, hiking trails, cross-country ski trails, a boat launch, picnic areas, etc.  Dogs are welcome, on-leash, and it's a large enough place that it's easy to not run into very many people.  The trails are well-maintained and every trail we walked on was mowed grass, not dirt or gravel.  The wildflowers are gorgeous on the trails through the prairie and the mosquitoes were a bit bad in the woodsy trails (but that's everywhere this time of year, unfortunately).   While dogs are allowed on-leash on the hiking trails there also is an off-leash dog park.  One nice touch here is that they have two separate areas - a regular dog park and then a separate area for "small dogs".  A very nice touch for those who may feel out-sized at many other dog parks.  The dog parks have trails through a prairie setting. Ample, free parking and you can buy your dog park permits on-site if you don't already have one.
5	Thank u, Marissa! Best 40 mins we have spent at an out of town dog park!! We met at least 5 different groups of dogs as we walked through the Lake County Dog Park. Thank you, Dane County for making this park so accessible, fun and clean for everyone.
5	Oh my gosh. What a gem of a bike path that leads past here (Capital City Trail). Rolling meadows of wildflowers in full, scented bloom, butterflies everywhere, peaceful and quiet, just a few hills and some fun twists and turns. Wildlife viewing piers extending into the marsh. Picnic tables and benches tucked here and there at picturesque intervals. At the end, Fitchburg and dining options for weary bike folks. What a great time. I'll be back!
