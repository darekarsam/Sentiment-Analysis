5	These guys are awesome! Impeccable service! I went there twice. The first time was after I drove over some train tracks and loosened something. It sounded like my muffler was dragging on the road. They checked it out and pinned whatever it was back up for FREE. The second time I took my car there because my engine light came on. They diagnosed it and spent a couple of hours trying to figure out what it was. When they couldn't, they reset the sensor and refused to charge me a cent because they couldn't figure out what was wrong with it! So 2 services, free of charge! Wonderful guys, I will take my car here next time she needs something again for sure!
5	I went there to do a fix where I had already bought the part and just needed labour.  I expected it would take a while so I headed to  a nearby place to eat.  Just as the food arrived, they called to say the work was already done.  They charged me 30 minutes labour, instead of a larger time period that I was expecting.  They will be seeing me again next time .
1	I had the headlights on my car re-surfaced at Mufflerman today. The difference is night and day, BUT in the process they scraped the paint off my car.Instead of pulling the lights out to do the job, they tapped around the lights (with green painter's tape), slipped, and took a chunk out of the paint.They touched up the scrape with a touch up pen, and gave me the bill-- at full price. When I asked what was being done about the damage caused to my car, the serviceman I dealt with, Chris, was arrogant and rude, refusing any compensation for the damage. I have gone to mufflerman a few times in the past and have had good experiences, but this experience wipes those off the board. I will NEVER bring another vehicle to Mufflerman.
