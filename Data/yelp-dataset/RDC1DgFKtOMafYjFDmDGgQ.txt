1	UW Health Monona is the worst clinic in the world. I finally left after waiting an hour to see my doctor. They are incompent and don't care how much of their patients time they waste
3	Hey, I was only there twice--it' not my regular clinic, but got perfectly good service. Amazing how people can be so thoughtless as to expect medical personnel to work on a rigid schedule--think about it dude.
4	I've taken my kids there for lab work and the clinic personnel are always very nice and professional.  It is not as busy as the bigger clinics, so I prefer to go there instead of where our docs are when we need labs done between visits.
2	Actually to the last reviewer, yes they do run on a rigid schedule here, if your even 5 minutes late your skipped and have to reschedule. I've been with uw system now for about 2 yrs since my employers plan switched us from Dean.  And I have to say I miss dean so much. Better service, friendlier doctors, the list goes on. This opinion also applies to most of their clinics ( urgent care, optometry, psychology, hospital/ER)
