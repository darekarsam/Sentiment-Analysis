1	Went in twice to have multiple sandwiches made and both times I was given an attitude.  One instance when I asked to have a sandwich remade because it fell apart I was snuffed at and the employee said "are you serious." And the huffed when I said yes how am I supposed to eat it.  I then called to speak with a manger and was told they were not in.  I asked for a phone number and was told they could not give it and I would have to call back.

And to call this place a "restaurant" is kind of a stretch.Honestly, I would probably never eat at Subway if it weren't for the fact that it is very close to my house and it's my son's favorite place for a quick lunch. The reason I take him there (besides the fact that he likes the simple kid's sandwich he always gets) is that it is cheap. If I get him just the kid's sandwich, I think it's only abt 3 bucks.So put my issues aside and I have to say I was still surprised today when a fly landed on the bread and made his way up the length of it while I was saying, "I *can't believe that huge fly* just landed on my bread!" The employee was removing someone else's sandwich from the oven and she saw the fly. As she walked back over she said, "Do  you want me to get you another piece of bread?" Instead of saying what I was thinking which was, "Did you seriously just ask me that??" I said, "Yes!" Come on. That should have been done w no question asked.
3	Nice people.  Quick service.  Okay subs.
