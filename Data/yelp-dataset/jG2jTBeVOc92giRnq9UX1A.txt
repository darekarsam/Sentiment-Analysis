1	Terrible location. Just a couple girls gossiping about their crappy relationships. Totally inattentive  and irritating. Store looked in a disarray. I WILL NOT spend my money here. They didn't even acknowledge my presence.
2	The selection isn't so great. They do have a bunch of athletic shoes, but the dressy stuff looks cheap and quite frankly I'd never buy. The sales associate was very monotone which didn't make the experience any better, but got 2 pairs of Zapatos for $50 so I guess not bad
5	I'm not sure why there are bad reviews. I've been coming here since they opened, for a couple of years, and I've never had bad service. The employees are always attentive.  I've never had to wait for service. The selection is what you'd expect from a shoe store, it has shoes. This is the only store I shop for shoes for my kids.
