3	Le Marly is ok.  I did not eat here, I only drank.  They have a signature raspberry martini with Vodka, raspberry puree and a basil leaf, which is good.  Most of the drinks are under $10, for example liquor drinks are about $8.50, 20oz beer about $7.50.  The appetizers ordered by some of the other people in our group looked good, but I did not try them.While this place is located on Beaver Hall in the middle of downtown, it's unfortunate that it is not very frequented.  Literally no one came in while we were there for almost 3 hours on a Thursday.They have a very modern decor with a Purple theme.  The staff was nice, took our coats upon entry with out a fee.  Also were very attentive to our needs (drinks)Personally, I wouldn't pick this place for an evening out, but if the group was already going, I'd tag along.
