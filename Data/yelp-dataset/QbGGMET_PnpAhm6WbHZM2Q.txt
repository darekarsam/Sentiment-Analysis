5	A great collectables store! The owner Simon is amazing and will help you with whatever you need. If you're looking for a specific toy he'll do his best to try and get it for you. They do special orders with no problems. It's my go to when I need my toy fix. Support your local toy store!
5	Copying this from my review from the old location :   Simon is a fantastic and nice guy. I'm really happy to see his store doing well and it's nice the stock rotates enough that you want to keep coming back. Finally Madison has it's own version of Kid Robot and a neat place to find some awesome anime, manga, geeky, and pop culture stuff. If it's not stocked in the store, Simon is more than happy to find it and order it for you...He will also keep checking on the item if it's out of stock or back ordered. I also love that he remembers his customer's name. It's the small bits of personal experiences and interactions that make this store top notch.
5	My friend brought me here awhile back. I kinda forgot about it. It's not my cup of tea, but for what it is it's amazing. I sent a few photos of the selection of Gundam kit things and she freaked out in excitement. She made me promise to bring her here when she's in town. The store really has all the little cute plastic toys you could ever want. The staff was also really friendly. I have no idea how the prices are compared to online, but nothing seemed outrageous or anything.
