4	This place was great!  Everything was clean, and the employees were welcoming and interested in talking to the guests. rather than just to each other.  They were also all out on the floor, not hiding in a back room until they're told they have a client, like other salons I've gone to.The pedicure was good, but nothing out of the ordinary from the usual routine -- soak, scrub, massage, paint, etc. -- and the price was typical at around $30, plus extra for design.I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try :)
2	I had a very disappointing experience at this salon.  My daughter and I went there hoping for mani-pedis and some fun time together.  When we came in we were directed to the pedi chairs, where we sat for almost an hour before they even filled the basins.  Then we had another very long wait while we soaked our feet.  There was a horrible smell in the room which my daughter said was probably the autoclave machine.  The TV was on very loud, also,  which didn't make for a serene experience.  Finally someone came and started giving me my pedi,  but my daughter continued to wait while another employee worked on someone who had come in after us.  My daughter finally gave up and left.  I spoke up about this and the employee was nice and apologetic about it.  The pedicure was fine, no problem there, but I didn't have time for a manicure and left without tipping them.  I won't be back as I don't have time to spend two or three hours at a nail salon.  They should have warned us that it would be a long wait.
1	Bad job on nails.  Tech messed one nail up and I was asked to come back the next day to fix it.  Staff is polite however, service and final finish on nails was awful. I will never go back!
