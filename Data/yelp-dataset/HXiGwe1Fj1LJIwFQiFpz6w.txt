3	I stopped at this location to purchase gas on my way back to California. The first pump I pulled up to and went to put gas in would not work. It would ask you to select credit or debit then it would tell you the pump was busy. So I moved to a different pump; fortunately this one worked. The gas prices were reasonable for the area only $3.37 a gallon (the cheapest I paid the entire trip). I also went into the store: it was clean and organized. The wait time for the register was decent and the cashier was friendly. I am giving it 3 stars instead of 4 due to the gas pump issue.
1	Worst gas station EVER. The pumps are ALWAYS broken!!! The pumps/machines  always have graffiti all over the screens, and are so slow!  The store itself is disgustingly dirty.
