5	We hired SnapFanatic for a charity event and they were fantastic.  The company was punctual and very accomodating for such a large event.  They were very proactive and   met with the venue themselves to set up their equipment.  During the event, they were energetic and social and added an extra depth to the fundraiser.  Their background was fantastic and their props were fun and and had a wide variety of items.  I would highly recommend them for any special event whether big or small!
