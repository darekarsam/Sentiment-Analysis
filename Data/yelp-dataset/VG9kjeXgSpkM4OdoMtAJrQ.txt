5	I had a very good experience here at Dr T she is a great and understanding primary care physician.   Would recommend to anyone
5	She is still as good as it gets.  I have never had a problem getting in nor have I had an issue with anyone in the office.  They are kind and always take there time.
2	Dr. Talley does not seem like a caring doctor. She is nice and pleasant but I just don't get the impression that she actually cares about me as a patient. The office staff is friendly. If you are looking for a doctor that gives you their full attention, Dr.Talley will leave you feeling anything but.
5	Dr. Talley is one of the best doctors we have seen.  Our family has been going to her for years now.  She will see everyone in your family children and adults alike.  Se always takes the time to listen.  She will test/ treat or medicate as necessary but does not just jump to perscribing antibiotics.  She has a wonderful and balanced approach to medicine.  She is very friendly and extremely caring.  We have never had a problem getting an appointment even for a sick visit always within 24hrs.  Times when the sick visit was urgent her staff would find a way to get you in.  For children she always gives a very thorough annual exam.
