5	Sequoya is an amazing school community, where teachers, parents, and the administration all work together to create the best possible well rounded experiences for our children. Students are given incredible experiences to learn and grow. My kids have thrived here and we couldn't be happier. Teachers and the administration are always accessible and receptive to discuss our children's needs. The school also has amazing technology, leadership opportunities, lessons in responsibility, great academics and a general small town community feel... and a rock climbing wall for PE - making it super cool!!! And best of all - it's a public school!
5	If you are looking for a highly academic school with a small-town community feel in the middle of Scottsdale look no further. After much review of the local schools in our area we decided to open enroll my daughter at Sequoya for K. I have been extremely happy with this choice. Sequoya is a top rated school with a strong community. The pillar of this school is its leadership forged by Dr. Braney. She is out on campus speaking with her students and parents every day. The Parent Teacher Association also plays a large role in the success of this school and welcomes all parents. There are diverse leadership experiences for ALL students in 4-5th grade to prepare them for middle school.The on-site pre-school (Children's Choice) is remarkable! We were paying a considerable amount more for childcare before. This is not childcare; it is seasoned, caring teachers preparing their students for K. Regards, Sequoya Parent
5	Fantastic! Sequoya Elementary School is a public school, part of the Scottsdale Unified School District. After attending Sequoya, students feed into Cocopah Middle School and eventually the highly regarded Chaparral High School.Sequoya is a wonderful school with talented teachers, involved parents and a demographically strong and diverse student body. No reason for considering a charter school if you live in this area.
