5	LeJon Jenkins was extremely professional and courtesy.He went out of his way just to find me rental properties. He exemplifies the best as a realtor. You can count on him to go out of his way to providing outstanding customer service.
5	We had the great pleasure of working with LeJon recently when we needed to find a new house to rent. We talked to him about what we were looking for and he immediately started sending listings to us. And he listened to what we had to say about our needs/concerns. We met with him to see some listings and on top of being extremely professional, he has a great personality! He was really informative and straight forward which you need in this situation. He was very helpful with explaining things that we were not familiar with. Always easy to get a hold of and he was always flexible to our needs. We HIGHLY recommend LeJon if you need to buy, sell, or rent!!
5	Great follow through! Follows up, even a year later. Love it!
5	I have nothing but absolutely positive things to say about my experience with Lee, being in the hands of someone I trust, and who listened to exactly what I was looking for was very helpful in what is usually a stressful time. I found Lee to be highly knowledgeable, professional and punctual. I definitely recommend Lee for all your real estate needs.
