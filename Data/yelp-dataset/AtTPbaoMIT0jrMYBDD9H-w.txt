4	What a delightful new discovery on McGill Street.  Amazing food, ambience and service.  For two, we were suggested to order 6-7 mezzes. Each dish consisted of the freshest ingredients with very original flair, some Greek and others not so Greek, more contemporary.  Everything was very delicious.  Check out the photos!  We are going back later this week with a larger group to try more!!!
4	First of all, we went there for Mtl a table event.Pro: food was delicious, well prepared and good. Service was really smooth.Cons: portions was a little bit small, so we have to fill ourself with the bread dipped in a really good olive oil... The only thing that seemed normal size was the dessert...For the event, Ikanos prepared a special menu for montreal a table. As mentionned, don't get tricked by the menu as the menu is for 2. Each dish has to be shared by 2, which was a bit disappointing since the portions are already small. Also, for the event as it might be too late already, but I recommand to not go there in a odd number of guests, since the portions size do not seem to accomodate the extra person.First service: tataki tuna and fluke carpaccio. Delicious, I will come back there just for those dishes, if they are serving them outside MTL a table.Second service: scallops and halibut. Scallops and halibut were good, but again, the halibut portion didn't seem to get bigger to accomodate our extra guest. Tzatziki was amazing, one of the best I even tried. It was unfortunate that there was just a little dash of this on the plate...Main dishes: duck magret with eggplant, ravioli moussaka, red snappers and shrimps (2 pieces). Duck magret was overcooked, eggplant a bit too salty. Beside those two dishes, nothing to complain about, everything was good.Overall: food was good, portions were small, highly recommended if not really hungry and looking for high quality seafood dishes...
