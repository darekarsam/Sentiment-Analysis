5	Motolab did an excellent job getting the suspension on my KTM dialed in. I've had a few people in the past tune my suspension but this is by far the best. Rob was very knowledgeable and friendly. I highly recommend.
5	Great, professional work. Rob is a perfectionist in doing the job right. Good, fair prices. Highly recommended.
5	I purchased a 2015 KTM EXC 500 and decided I wanted the 39" seat height lowered closer to my 34" inseam as well as the suspension professionally dialed in, so after a little research I decided on Moto Lab. I could not be more pleased with the service that Rob Kozler provided. This is personalized service like you will rarely find anymore. He very patiently listened and answered my questions and explained the workings of suspensions at a level that never left me overwhelmed. His shop is meticulous in organization and extremely clean - something I expect from a professional shop - and his attention to detail was at the highest level.He's full of positive energy and eagerness to help you make good choices. If you are considering a professional suspension for your dirt bike (especially KTM) you owe it to yourself to call him and discuss your options. You will not be disappointed with any part of a transaction with this company.
