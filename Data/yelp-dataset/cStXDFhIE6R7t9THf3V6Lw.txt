5	Great bank! Very nice employees, although a slightly weird location. Its located in Scottsdale next to a pizza shop and a best buy in a strip mall. I came in, they printed me checks really quickly, and called it a day. Thanks everyone!!
5	Convenient location, great hours, and a notary always on site.
5	I don't have an account with Chase but I've made some deposits here for other accounts and everyone that works here is always so helpful and kind. I would consider opening a Chase account based on my experience at this location. Plus they have free cookies =)
5	This branch has excellent customer service.  Jesse opened a new account for me and was very helpful and friendly.  Went back later that day to open an account for my daughter and Jesse was busy so branch manager Lisa helped us.  She took the time to explain everything to my daughter since this was her first account and made sure everything was set up just the way we needed it.  After we left, my 14 year old daughter turned to me and said "I really liked that lady, she was so cool!".  I highly recommend this branch if you're going to open a Chase account in Scottsdale.
