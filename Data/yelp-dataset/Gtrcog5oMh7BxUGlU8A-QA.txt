5	$5 for a great multi-use aquatic center that's open to all? Yes, please!  I got the chance to check out the Goodman Pool today with some cousins, my sister, and their various kids of various ages.  A bunch of adults and children from 8 months - school age and everyone had a great time. Lots of safe places for splashing about for the littlest ones, deeper water for proper swimming for the older ones as well as fountains, spray features, and 2 slides to be enjoyed by all ages. I had a blast and we plan on making it a regular summer family event.
5	Get to the pool right when they open if you want a great chair!
4	Perfect day for a swim, pool looks maintained and clean. Got early enough we got chairs to lay out on. Not a whole lot to review, its a pool not crowded (yet). Sunscreen check I'm good to go
