4	Super bistro! Look cool and eclectic, nice decor! Staff is friendly, refreshing small place to eat!hours of operation are not the best, closed on Saturday and mostly open 8-5pmwould recommend it and can't wait to come back
1	I used to meet clients at La Bistrote on a regular basis. The owner was very rude on numerous occasions - making us switch tables to accommodate larger parties when the place was completely empty and most notably for berating my clients for not ordering something during a 5 min meeting. It was absolutely embarrassing! We were planning to come back for lunch a few mins later but after this encounter, I will never go back to La Bistrote again. If you don't care about being decent to your customers, don't open a restaurant.
4	La Bistrote is all about a cozy environment for coffee, tea or a quick lunchThe staff is friendly, and you can't go wrong with the pick of the day.Griffintown have some good choices, but this is certainly one of the best.
5	Been a couple of times for lunch and really enjoyed the food.  Staff are friendly. Will definitely be back time and time again
4	Not many vegetarian options but what they do have is quite yummy!The squash soup, eden salad and antipasto sandwich were all great.
