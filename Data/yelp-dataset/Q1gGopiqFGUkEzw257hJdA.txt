5	Love this place, its quick and easy.  You do have to spend a little bit more money but it beats standing in line at the DMV!!!
5	Never again will I go to the DMV. If you want to be treated like a human being while getting title work done this the way to go. Well worth the few extra bucks. Nice people to business with!
5	Great fast service. No lines. In and out quick. Convenient. I will be back.
3	My purpose here was simple.  I had to return the license plate from our totaled vehicle in order to get the refund on the registration of the vehicle.  The refund is not handled here, they are just an authorized location to return the plate.  The guy behind the counter was very friendly, took the plate, and that was it.Now that I know this place is here, however, I can foresee coming here to handle some DMV related things instead of going way out of my way to one of the DMV offices and sitting around for 1/2 an hour (or more) waiting for my number to be called.
5	Paying for vehicle registration or title transfer is never enjoyable.  TSI makes it as pleasant as it can be. It is so dependable and consistent that I recommend to people to pay the extra.  It is so worth it.
5	No more DMV for me!!!  Conveniently located next to Fry's on Alma School and Germann, it was a nice little office. The ratio of workers to customers was 4 to 2, so I walked in and right up to counter and the "nice young man" (God that makes me sound old!) got started on my title transfer right away.  Listen to me--do NOT waste your precious time at the DMV with their multiple lines, waiting for you magic number to appear on the screen.
