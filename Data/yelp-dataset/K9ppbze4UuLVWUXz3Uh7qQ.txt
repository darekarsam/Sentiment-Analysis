5	This place was phenomenal. I booked online with a groupon for a brazilian wax, and got a reminder via email the day before. Khiana was my esthetician and she was friendly and kind. Her technique was awesome- she started with the worst parts and then quickly finished up the rest. Although not painless (that would be magic!), it was quick and well done. Then she scanned my groupon and I was out the door. The location is within the Hollistic Wellness Center and is a beautiful building and room. There is parking available. I would definitely go back and recommend this place to anyone trying to get beach ready.
5	I broke my own rule and bought a groupon for a place without many yelp reviews...and I'm so glad I did! Khiana was super warm, friendly and professional, making the whole experience a really positive one.
5	Khiana is amazing! She has a wonderful demeanor & is so trustworthy on doing the right job every time. I love that it's her own private room. I found her on Groupon for a great deal & have gone back even without them now.She's a keeper :)
