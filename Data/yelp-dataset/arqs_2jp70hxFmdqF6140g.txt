4	So nice to have an indoor Cook-Out in the neighborhood. Right near CMC Pineville so people can step out for great burgers, BBQ, and shakes.The hush puppies have a Fritos taste with a light touch of onion. Goes great with pulled pork BBQ sandwich. Wish they had frag lemon slices for the ice tea.Pineville is now on the map!
4	For you George!!  Exquisite milkshakes, vast selection, apparently stay away from the pork!
