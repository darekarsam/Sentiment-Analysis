5	Had my car worked on for multiple issues.  Bob was my mechanic.  He flushed my transmission and replaced my fuel pump.  It's an older shop but the guys are very friendly and the owner Mark is personable.  A customer of mine recommended Milford to me and I'm glad I used them.  I'll be next taking my Suburban for some service!
5	I was referred here by a family friend. After being told my car would need a little over a grand in repairs by another shop, I went here bc I was told they wouldn't screw me over. They did not dissapoint! The mechanics were very friendly and helpful. They checked my car and told me only 1 major repair needed to be done unlike the 5 other things I was originally told. They fixed it up and I got my car back the next day. Cost went originally from over a thousand in repairs to only $250.The outside may seem a little sketchy bc of the road construction and older buildings but seriously this place was great. Honest mechanics who don't try to screw you out of money!
5	I was referred here years ago by a friend who used to be a "high end" auto mechanic.  I have only used Terry as my mechanic, but I know that all of the mechanics at Milford are great.   I've had Terry work on numerous cars of ours over the years.  He always explains everything that needs to be done, and I've never needed work on the same problem twice!   It gets repaired correctly the first time!  Terry has always done all of our work and come in UNDER the original quote ... every time.  Milford auto is easy to miss  -  like if you blink you'll pass it right by ...  but don't let that (or the area of town) scare you away.  Even if you have to drive half way across town ... trust me, it's worth it.  They sit on the North west corner of Vegas and Decatur. So refreshing to have a mechanic who is honest, and does the work right the first time .. and who will NEVER rip you off!
