4	It's located in the MGM'a food court. I had never seen this place before, but chicken sounded good. I ordered a five piece chicken tenders with fries for $9.95 and a cup of water to share with my boyfriend. They give you a pager after they ring you up to come back for your food. It didn't take too long, and when I was called, they were very nice and gave me an extra side of sauce when asked.The chicken tenders were really good. The chicken wasn't dry, like I expect most chicken tenders to be, and their original sauce is good - although... I don't know what it's ingredients are. Lol.
4	This place was in the food court at our hotel in the MGM. One of the many places we had in the food court. How can you go wrong with chicken tenders? I ordered the 3 strip plate which came with a side. It usually comes with fries but I decided to swap those out with the mac and cheese. It added to the price, but I wasn't really feeling fries at the time.The tenders were pretty good. Better than a lot of the ones I've had out there. The chicken was fresh, moist and tender. Where most get it wrong is in the breading. Some can be too hard and dense. The breading on these were great, not too soft or too hard, just right. Which makes chewing easier. The seasoning was good too, I hate when chicken tenders are too salty, but these were also in good proportion. The mac and cheese I got was good as a side and fulfilled my craving, just wish the portion was bigger for it.Overall, a good choice for a quick bit to eat if you are nearby in the hotel.
