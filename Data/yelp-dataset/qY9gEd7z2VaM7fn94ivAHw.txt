1	The name is more appropriate than ever. Weird that I now long for Coyote Alley.
4	Cheap drinks, great bartender, close to home - gets a thumbs up from me.  The bands that have played are pretty good as well.  The only complaint? Get a bouncer or someone who will kick out the creepers!  When I say "no" to dancing with you, it means "no" not "come back in 15 minutes and try again".
5	We were looking for a place to eat and the bar down the street had already closed its kitchen at 7pm, so we came over here for the first time to discover 2 for one burgers (Thurs special), great service and food, and reasonably priced beers. We have discovered our new favorite bar. Best part is that it is close to home and the owners are involved. We'll be back.
4	Great line dance lessons on Wednesday nights...Great atmosphere, great staff and a nice place to be that is close to home.  Only problem, the dance floor is too small.  Music can be toned down a bit...Love country western, oldies and nice dance music!
