1	Owner is a moron. We waited for over 40 mns for our chicken. Spoke to the owner about it but he didnt do a thing about it. When we left, in front of our 6 yrs old, he told me "so was it worth it bitching about your chicken?" amongst other thing. He was very rude and blaming his staff (our waitress went 3 times to check with the kitchen!) for it being so long. My husband told him to be polite and he then insulted my husband and wanted to fix it with a fight and said he was lucky his son was there
4	Cool Place (in the back room if you are too hot, or terrace i summer) Very warm place (in front, close to the grill). So, depending on your mood, this place will warm your soul. Awesome fish! Delicious ribs. Good veggies and fries. Decent wine list. Fair prices. GO there! Worth a try.
3	Had the mixes seafood plater the shrimp really stood out.  Next will go for the giant shrimps dish.
