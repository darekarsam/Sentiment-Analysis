5	Professional therapeutic massage for relaxation, sports injuries and rejuvination.
5	I have to be honest, I always take on YELP and never give :)  I use these reviews constantly - but Sam is just so good I felt like I need to share her :)  It is SO rare when you find a massage therapist who is a) REALLY good at what they do b) REALLY knowledgeable about the human body c) REALLY a great person and d) really flexible to schedules, etc.  For me body work is essential to the dream I am chasing (runner)  - and so her deep tissue is the best I have ever gotten and I have lived all over the country and worked with a  lot.  she has gotten me to the starting line healthy and keeps me working like a fine tuned machine :)  BUUTTTTTTT having said that, there have been days when I just felt beat down and needed a "normal" massage - and she can do that too - - her toolbox of massages and skills is best in class - - you will not be disappointed  - she can do whatever you need for YOU.  Just ask!  I am glad I did - she's been my secret weapon to a happy body :)
5	Hands down one of the best massage experiences I have had. Samantha was very accommodating to my schedule and was able to book me on short notice. She can come to you or accommodate you in her space which is exceptionally CLEAN!!! I tend to go for a deep tissue massage to help me cope with an active style and Samantha definitely did not disappoint! She will now be my number one option for massage up near my neighborhood(Pinnacle Peak/North Scottsdale)!
