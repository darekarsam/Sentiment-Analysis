5	They're extremely helpful and relaxed. Whenever I have questions they either know the answer, or quickly look it up. I got my bike from them, and after a couple hundred miles I couldn't be more satisfied. They also host some awesome events, so keep a lookout for those.
5	Awesome relaxed atmosphere, very friendly and helpful staff. They make you feel like a friend and not just a customer. Great quality of bikes, have been riding my custom contender for just over 1000 miles and still is rock solid. Love the company and love the products.
5	Amazing staff!!! Super friendly, knowledgeable, and very helpful. I ordered a saddle they don't carry and it actually came in when they said it would.
5	This is the place to go if you need great service. Everyone I've encountered here has been a prime example of good people with great skills and know how. Prices are fair and the selection is varied and well stocked.  If you are in the market for a fixed gear or single speed bike check them out.
5	Purchased my new bike on Saturday and couldn't be more stoked about it! The staff were good people! both personable, while being knowledgable about everything State. We started with a stock Vossen black camo edition bike, and was able to add all the red and black I wanted at a small upgrade cost. Definitely recommend their dope bikes and customizable features. The affordable price and quality of their bikes doesn't hurt either! Stoked to begin taking some day to day rides!
