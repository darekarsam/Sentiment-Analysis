3	The equivalent of California's "Costco" warehouses ..but with a bigger produce and meat section and significantly smaller lines.   Wow... amazing!I can't sum it up much better than that.  If you are looking for family items in bulk (but please stay away from the unhealthy, processed foods, ok?) this is the place for you...
3	I used to be a member of the Sam's club in the University; that place was always crazy busy with long lines and a so so selection of merchandise. Left all that behind when I discovered BJ.s. Their selection of ware's is diverse; you can find lot's of great deals. I've found cute clothing, books, and housewares. My favorite recent find is a humidifier that has a retro look like an old fifties appliance, and it works great! There are some seriously good prices on Bluray and other DVD's; in particular older stuff. If you're into classics they probably have a better selection than Best Buy for less than half the price.The main negative is related to the self check out registers. At least half the time when you scan something it beeps and you put it on the conveyor; then it announces that item was not scanned and you have to try again. Invariably you have to have one of the workers come over with their card and try and fix things; it's maddening.Whoever laid out that whole shopping center needs to go back to design school or something. There is only one way in and one way out; it's a mess to get out of on the weekends. I just bypass that and shop during the week.
4	This is where I get my gas a lot because it is usually the cheapest. Best prices for propane also. Clean parking lot and store. Friendly staff. It also has an automotive service shop if you need something repaired or serviced on your vehicle.
