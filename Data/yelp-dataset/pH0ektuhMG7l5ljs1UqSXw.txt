1	This is absolutely the least professionally, worst mechanic I have ever heard of!  The sucker you in with a good price and warranty, but the work is absolutely shoddy and they have now kept the car 5 weeks for a warranty repair.  GO ANYWHERE ELSE!!
1	I wouldn't even give one star if that was possible!!! The owner Greg is ridiculous, he's had our only truck for OVER A YEAR!!! Sitting out in the elements with all of the engine parts siting in the bed of the truck, starting  to rust, our brand new tires getting flat spots because it hasn't moved, and our trailer hitch being stolen. Has our money and our vehicle! Has yet to finish the repairs even after several attempts to try and contact and converse with him or even after contacting the better business bureau... he has still yet to finish the job and get us our vehicle back. Horrible customer service, there is absolutely no reason to keep a vehicle this long with cash already in hand. We have been ignored, given false hopes, bogus times of completion and just plan screwed over. I would absolutely NOT take any vehicle that you want fixed in a timely matter to this company. We were called on Monday 6/9/14 to tell us our truck would be done Friday 6/13/14... It's now the next Monday 6/16/14 and the truck hasn't even moved out of the yard!!! This isn't the first, second or even third time that we have been given an estimated time of completion with no return. The only good thing I can say that is anywhere near this shop is the receptionist/secretaries. At least they speak to you when you call and come in... Much more than I can say about Greg.
5	Engine builders went above and beyond for me. I will definitely recommend this company for a rebuilt engine. Thank you Engine Builders
