5	Probably the best golf store in Vegas. Most of the other stores in town seem to be TaylorMade-centric but Golf Galaxy seems to have it all. I live a couple miles from the Charleston/Durango store and find myself always looking for an excuse to make the drive over to this one instead. Huge selection (including used clubs - which I always scour looking for a deal) and always seems to be fairly priced for the market. My only complaint is for the golf industry in general.... can you please offer more hat options for large headed individuals like myself? I've been wearing the same, disgusting Titleist flat bill for a couple years now. Thanks.
5	The people working there are pretty knowledgeable about their selection. Was trying out some drivers at the demo center and turns out ping is one of the top drivers, recommended by a staff member. Never tried them nor did I read reviews until I recently got back into golf. Taylormade and callaway are more forgiving but distance wise, ping had it. May come back to purchase it.Great selection of clubs. They don't just have one type such as the Taylormade center or before it was the callaway center.
3	My boyfriend is a golfer, so I frequently get to visit this shop. I really enjoy the visits and our time browsing around.... the staff is GREAT, they are very knowledgeable and so very nice!
