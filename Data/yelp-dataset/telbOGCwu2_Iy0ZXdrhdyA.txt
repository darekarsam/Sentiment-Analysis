4	The Hubs and I stop by every sneaker store in every city we go to.  Did I say EVERY city? Yeah...(not that I'm bitter about it, LOL).The staff at MEK were sooo nice! Right when we walked in, we were welcomed by the staff, they were helpful, fun to talk to, and they were quick to bring out anything we wanted to see or try on.  There was a good selection of some Euro brands I haven't heard of, and there was absolutely NO pressure to buy anything.
5	Had a great experience at Mile End Kicks today when I walked in sopping wet with my shoes and socks just utterly soaked through. Calm and friendly gents helped me consider options and before I knew it I was in love and laced up in a pair of super water proof and cute men's boots and in dry socks too! The store is in two small but well-appointed rooms on a pretty corner of Parc. The shoes - brands and models - make sneaker people smile and nod happily. Not a huge selection and not cheap stuff, but excellent for exactly what it is.
4	Great selection of kicks and though the prices are great, they're pretty middle ground.
5	I walked into Mile End Kicks on my way home from a long day at the office. I was greeted by the very awesome and super helpful, Sam. He helped me acquire the Converse ballet flats of my dreams and didn't laugh when I showed him my hideous looking 'cobra toe'.Good prices, great selection of old skool runners for men, women and kidlets and more colours are coming in for the Spring; I will definitely be back!
