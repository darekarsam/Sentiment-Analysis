5	TBW was my salon when I lived on the West Side of town, and it was almost like a home from home for me. The staff are friendly and welcoming, often they give out free manicures if you're in there for a while getting your hair done. Caren has to be the best hairdresser in Edinburgh; she has exciting ideas for hair, and will always make sure that you leave feeling a million dollars. I don't know why I ever trust anyone else with my barnet!
