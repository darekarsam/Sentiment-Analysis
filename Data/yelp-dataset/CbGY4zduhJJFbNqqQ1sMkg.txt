4	Due to a fiasco with the STM, I didn't get a chance to visit Marche Jean-Talon as I had wanted to, but I got lucky on my walk back to the hotel by happening upon this market!Its smaller than Jean-Talon but I found the quality to be high and prices were reasonable. The shopkeepers were all very sweet and gave me samples of their products.  You could tell that they were extremely proud of their offerings.There is a nice little cafe with an outdoor patio where I enjoyed a doppio espresso with a score of others enjoying a Sunday morning.I wish that I would have stopped by here earlier in my trip because I didn't want to take back any fruits and veg across the border but if I had come earlier, I would have stocked up my hotel room with tons of fresh, yummy stuff!!
1	The Saint-Jacques Market barely even qualifies as a market.  Housed in an impressive and rather massive looking building, the interior is much smaller, but it doesn't feel crowded at all since there are only half a dozen small shops in the whole building.  Better than half the retail space remains vacant and it's not hard to see why since customer are few and far between.  The five minutes it took me to walk the length of the market space is five minutes I'll never be able to get back.  The one thing that had me visit the market on occasion was Premiere Moisson which has subsequently closed leaving little reason to revisit the place. A few web searches revealed that the building had been converted to office space, but in 2007 the city sold the property to a private developer with the condition that it remain a food market.  As it stands now, it's a near complete waste of space and I'd rather see the building converted to condos, at least then the space would benefit somebody.It's not a farmers market, it's not even a reasonable facsimile of a grocery store.  Take a picture from the outside cause it's a cool building, but continue strolling down the street as it's not worth actually stepping inside.
