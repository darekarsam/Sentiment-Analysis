5	Best old fashioned barber cut I've had in 20 years.  Tapered by hand with a straight edge razor, hot lather and neck/sideburn shave, leave smelling like Bay Rum and looking great.  Found by accident...will definitely go back.  Shop seems to be owned by father and son - Dad is who clipped me, but son had a following and several professional looking regulars willing to wait for him. First come, first serve.
5	great old school barber shop, excellent cut, and good pricing.
5	I have been coming to this Barber Shop for years. I have always received a professional cut exactly the way I wanted it. The owner is young yet proficient in cutting with old school methods to include hot lather and razor shave of your neck to complete the clean, crisp cut. Don't pass this one up fellas. Give this barber a try and you'll be coming back again and again. Professional cut, great value. Win, Win.
