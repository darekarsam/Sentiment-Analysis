5	Love this place.  all good
5	Sauce has the right blend of spices and flavor. The crust is light and flaky and with pizza with tasty sausage is perfectly cohesive! Great place for a great pizza!
1	Didn't get to try this place.  I ordered a personal pizza.  My tab was $5.40 (approx) and the owner said cash only or spend $7.00.  I explained I only brought my debit and he just shrugged.  I wont return!
5	5 stars!!!! Finally found a great pizza! And the prices were decent too! FYI: bring your own beer or wine!! Saves $!! Whatta deal! Pizza was thin crust, tasty sauce plus lots of cheese! We will definitely be back.... And will bring friends next time!
2	I have had good pizza here in the past so I thought I would try their pasta. I ordered pasta with meat sauce. First of all, the server never said there was a $1.00 extra charge for the meat sauce nor did she say there was a .50 cent additional charge for blue cheese on the salad. I questioned the bill but she said the prices were correct. No receipt for me to look at. I got the order to go and when I got home and opened the pasts, there was a layer of sauce on top and underneath was a layer of ground meat sprinkled over the past. The meat wasn't mixed into the sauce and was very bland hamburger meat. Anytime I have ordered meat sauce, the meat is cooked in the sauce. In my opinion, this wasn't meat sauce. After I got home, I looked on the menu and there I found the meat sauce and blue cheese were extra. Fine print and never told up front about the extra charge. Never going again. There are better places in the valley for pasta with REAL meat sauce, not bland hamburger crumbles over pasta with marinara sauce on top.
