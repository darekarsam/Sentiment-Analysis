3	First-floor restaurant that had lovely food and service that was exceptionally bad even for Germany. We were the second table to be seated after it opened for dinner service, so they can't blame it on a crowd! As I said, though, the food was delicious -- so if you're willing to stand a bit of a wait, head over to Shogun, near the Marktplatz.
