4	Solid place, I had a nice lady named Jennifer. She took the time to get it exactly right and was careful about getting it too short. They also did a good job shampooing my hair well. Watch for the location to change to a building next door in Aug 2011.
1	Absolute disaster! No style, no shape! Worst haircut I've ever got in my lifetime. Need to wear a hat to hide it.Don't even want to go to work or see ppl.Will never go back.
