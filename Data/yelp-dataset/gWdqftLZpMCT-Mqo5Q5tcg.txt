1	Patou may have expanded, but as the saying goes, it's not the size that matters. My friends and I were appalled by the service...or lack thereof. Not only did we wait one-half hour for our drinks,but we had to ask three servers for bread. We could excuse the mix-up of a crab cake entree instead of a crab crepe (the words do sound alike), but the server did not even apologize. After packing our own to-go boxes, the manager stopped by and offered dessert on the house. And then we waited--20 minutes--just for someone to take the order. We opted for the check and ended up waiting another 30 minutes. Patou seems excited about it's new space, but the restaurant's owners need to not let that go to their heads and focus on what comes first: the clientele.
4	I have eaten at Patou a couple of times, and I have always enjoyed myslef.  On my recent visit I went with my parents and my boyfriend and we received excellent service.  I had the patou salad to start and it was fabulous- I wanted more as soon as I was done eating it.  The menu has recently been revamped to include some wonderful entrees (traditional French dishes like chicken paillard and waterzooi), but don't forget to ask about the specials (my boyfriend ended up getting a pork chop with blueberry sauce special that was amazing).  The new menu does seem to have an emphasis on seafood, but as someone who doesn't really eat seafood I found several options that I enjoyed, so it should only be a problem with picky eaters.
2	I took my wife to Patou for a date night, and was not overwhelmed by the food.  The service was satisfactory, but not as good as one would expect for a French Bistro with $20+ dollar entrees.  The food was marginal to disappointing, once again not the caliber to expect.  Also the restaurant was only about 1/4 full on a Friday night, never a good sign.  Go to Lulu's off central instead.
