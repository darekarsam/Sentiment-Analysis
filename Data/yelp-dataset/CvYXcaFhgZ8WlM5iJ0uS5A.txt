4	You get a mix of people here. Townies. Professors. Grad students. Undergrads.The interior is really nice. Wood. Pretty handblown glass lamps. Etc.You can come in with a big group of people and find a spot to takeover. Pool tables. Darts. Foose.Cute, friendly waitresses.Good drink specials.Live music - for free.Overall low-key and a good time.
3	Good atmosphere, friendly service and awesome life music. There's karaoke as well. So, you can sing your heart out if you want to.
1	I really wanted to like this place, but had a bad experience. 1st time I went - I ordered nachos and they came with "squeeze cheese" mixed with shredded cheese. They were okay nachos, but slightly disappointing with the squeeze cheese...Next time I went, I requested only shredded cheese and had the squeeze cheese on the side in case I felt like dipping. As I was sitting at the bar munching, a cockroach crawled across the bar...I am having a difficult time getting that memory out of my head and have not gone back since!
1	I just heard The Office closed it's doors for good - shocking...
5	My favorite bar. I moved away and it closed.Sad
1	The Office is permanently closed. New business in same location is now V. Picasso, an upscale tapas bar owned by Victor Fuentes, which opened October 6, 2009.
