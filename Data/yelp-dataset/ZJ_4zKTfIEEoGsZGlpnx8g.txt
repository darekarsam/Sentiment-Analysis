3	I stopped in Rack Rooms last week to pick out some new tennis shoes. Sadly, they were sold out of my size in most of the shoes I was interested in.  They said that they could order my size and ship to the house for free though, if I wanted.  However, I finally found a pair that I liked in my size so I didn't need to take them up on their offer. They always have sales and coupons, so you can find some pretty good deals.
