5	I always start to question my life choices, whenever I eat gas station food.  This place is a monster of variety and convenience.  Ever since I quit smoking I rarely go inside gas stations, but this place came highly recommended by a coworker.  On their rotisserie thing they have hot dogs, corn dogs, sausages, and taquito like things.  They're all 2 for 2.22.  If you forgot your lunch that day or just hate yourself, these will fill that void in your stomach (just not in your soul).  They also have a number of pre-maid sandwiches and salads in a cooler section.  There appeared to be some sort of counter where you could also order hot pretzels and ice cream.  If sugar is your thing or you're gunning for diabetes, they have over twenty different flavors of slushies.   Cup sizes range from large to absurdly dangerous.  They also have a large variety of coffees and flavored teas.  Their cooler selection of sodas and beers seems to be along typical standards.  If you ever get a bout of self loathing, this is the place to act out on it.  You'll be thrilled with the bright colors and whirling machines.  All the amazing choices in food and beverage,  which will all fade after the horror of what you've consumed has set in.
5	Friendly employees and super clean! We love QT.
5	Always quick always clean, much better than any of the ghetto locations nearby. 1stop shop. Thank you for coming to this side of town!
5	Very well lit and clean.  I feel safe going to this gas station at any time, even in the middle of the night.  I have never been bothered by panhandlers or solictors like at the other gas stations in the area.
5	I came here with my sister for some tea and wow the tea, coffee and drink selection exceeded my expectations. The place is also clean well stocked and employees are friendly.
