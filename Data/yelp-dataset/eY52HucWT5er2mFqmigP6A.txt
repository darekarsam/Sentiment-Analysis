4	Helpful staff for the parts department. They do not seem to have much in the way of trailers, but that wasn't why we were here anyway. Prices were good, no complaints.
5	I was an out-of-town RV'er with no aircondtioning.  I tried the "Big" name place first, but with no success.  Luckily, I called "Dillon's", and got ahold of "Judy", who hooked me up with "Brian".  Told him my dilemma, 113 degrees and no AC, he said no problem, "let me make some calls and I will call you back".  10 minutes later he is calling for me to bring it in.  Judy, Brian, Nick and Don really went above and beyond getting me fixed up.  We had a slight warrantee issue that they recovered factory credit for me.  I highly recommend "Dillon's" for any RV needs.
5	We have had "service" in over 5 cities, including the "big name" place, which is almost everywhere.  We will never return to any of them.  Dillon's replaced our 2 air conditioners and repaired body damage quickly and efficiently.  They then installed a Roadmaster hookup to our brand new Jeep.  Nick and Don did outstanding work, as did the body person we never met.  The office (Sheila and Michelle) was always helpful.  We told Mr Dillon how happy we were and are.  There are now 2 places in the US where we can have our $370,000 coach worked on - the factory and Dillon's.  You just can't go wrong with these folks!Thanks, Nick and Don!
