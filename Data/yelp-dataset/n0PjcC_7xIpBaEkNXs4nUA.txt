5	After eating at the lounge, it's one of the best snack places in montreal. The bubble tea is good but the thing to come here for is their salt and pepper fried chicken... delicious! The price is very good too, fitting for this economy. The environment is relaxing, a nice place to bring friends and chat. Will definitely return. Remember to bring cash only.
5	Ahh I have great memories from this place so cant really comment anything negative other then the cash only policy. Which is a bit annoying..... ANYWHO I always come here with my friends and younger sibs/ cousins for rounds of card games over some great bubble tea and salt and pepper chicken. Thats it.. Thats how my typical time out here passes by. Chicken, the tea, the games over great company and laughs. If your in Brossard then do check the joint here, they are open late and have other food items as well. I'd say one of the cool hangout spots in montreal is right here beside panama ;]
4	Pineapple Bubble tea!! It is so refreshing. I love it.They also have little affordable snacks while you sit and enjoy your tea.Very relaxed atmosphere, nice to have a place like this that isn't downtown.Go on and try the little bubbles of fun:)
