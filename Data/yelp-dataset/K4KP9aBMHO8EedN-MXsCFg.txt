5	Very sorry you didn't appreciate Preston Hair - and sorry yelp have chosen to present two negative reviews ahead of all the positive reviews they do not recommend! I have been going to Preston Hair regularly for 6 years - I agree about the sexual 'jokes' and that you have to have a sense of humour or not about those! -  he has always done my hair brilliantly in a friendly atmosphere and i would not go anywhere else. He has never smelt of alcohol, or had shaking hands - perhaps GemmaS. that is the effect you had on him!
