4	Great smoothies but expensive.  You can buy protein powder/bars here too.
3	This Smoothie King is in a great location! It's conveniently located in a shopping center/food area off of Woodlawn and Park. It gets very busy during lunch. The employees are pretty fast so the wait time is short. The smoothies are delicious and flavorful. There are so many types of smoothies to choose from that you could go every day for weeks and never get the same one.
3	This location almost always has wheatgrass shots available which is why I make the drive every now and then. Depending on time of day the parking lot can be congested and parking scant (the tanning salon right next door is always crazy busy). The service is quick and efficient (no spills, no mixups). It's a little pricey considering they don't use fresh fruit.
4	Once in a while they have great coupons so make sure you take advantage of them! They are usually neighborhood mailings but i am sure a quick googleSearch online will also yield great saving results. I'd saying without the coupons it is a bit overpriced, almost $5 for a smoothie in charlotte?? After all these years, i still prefer the classic Carribean way flavor. It's pretty much strawberry based. I have never tried their enhancers but i am eager to hear what others have to day about them. Also, they claimThat some of their smoothies can substitute a meal, i am doubtful of that, maybe it can substitute my breakfast.
3	My experience here was delightful. They have various smoothies to choose from! Customer service is great even though it seems like a bunch if teenagers are running the place. I loved the angel food smoothie with added peanut butter!
