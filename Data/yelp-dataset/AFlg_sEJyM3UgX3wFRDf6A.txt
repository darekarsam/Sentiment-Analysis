5	I placed a call to Falconer Funeral Home while my daughter was in ICU and spoke with Chris. He was very patient and sympathetic as I explained my situation. 10 days later when I had to call for his services he remembered me even though he only heard sobs on the other end of the phone. From the moment I met with Chris, through the funeral and even afterwards I felt Chris truly cared about me, my daughter and my family. He was very patient as me a very picky and over the top mom made plans for the "perfect" funeral for her 21 yr old daughter. I highly recommend Falconer Funeral home and Chris Timothy for any and all funeral needs. It is very wonderful to know that in today's world there are people like Chris who really care.
1	First we actually moved our grandfather from this location to a much better location for me were treated with kindness and empathy for half the priceThey were overcharging us they were rude insensitive and made the entire situation coldhearted and painfulThe staff was cruel and absolutely not what we want to deal with at this timeLook elsewhere for you are wanting something a little bit more with a little bit more compassion
