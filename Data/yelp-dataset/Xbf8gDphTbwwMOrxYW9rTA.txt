1	$9.50 plus tax just to put a 3 X 6 box into another box to protect original packaging. Highway robbery plus the cost of shipping. Owner claims people pay over $10 for box packaging materials labor. Also needed an RMA printed and they charge $2.50 to RECEIVE an email plus $1 to print one page. Mind you they originally gave me the wrong email to forward to and had me waiting for that store to fax my email to the store I was wanting the email address for. What a joke to tell you $10 for a small box with a straight face plus the cost of shipping.
3	Its a UPS store.  Nothing great or terrible to report.  Prices are average for UPS and fedex.  A little steep, but thats what they are known for.  We came here to get a document notarized.  Staff is friendly and fast.  Will come back occasionally when i need to.
