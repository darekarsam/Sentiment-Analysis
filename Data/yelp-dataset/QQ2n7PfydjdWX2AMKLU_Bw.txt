5	- Super fast service- My waiter, James, was among the best and most courteous I've ever had- Food was delicious and perfectly executed- The potatoes deserve special mention as they weren't the salty paprika crap I usually expect from a breakfast place. They were nicely cooked with herbs and onions. Tasted amazing,- Pricing was reasonable as far as the better breakfast places go ($10 - $14 per dish)- I have nothing to complain about. It was the ideal experience and would gladly go back.
4	Fantastic, delicious breakfast. Fast service, line was quick and the food was most excellent.The only reason we're not giving 5 stars is the cantaloupe that wasn't quite ripe yet and it was a bit cold by the window seat.
2	This is a nice looking restaurant, it took the place of the failed Eggspectation off Sources Blvd. Poor service, only one coffe re-fill , burnt rye bread, dried out scrambeld eggs and dead looking fruit. Medicore breakfast, about the same you will get at la Belle Provence only a little more expensive.  (I am not knocking La Belle Provence, they do what they do well and you know what you are getting).There should be someone checking the food before it is sent out to the customers.  There is a far better breakfast place a stone's throw away and I suggest that the managemnt of this restaurant go there for breakfast  to get some tips on how to do it right.
