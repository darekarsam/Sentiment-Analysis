4	Anytime you can find a FULL sized Canadian Tire within the city core, you owe it to everyone else to inform them.Avoid the closet version of a Canadian tire in little Italy at all costs. Let me save you some time... they DON'T have what you're looking for.
5	Great, fast, honest inspection. I saved money on not replacing my break pads when another place would have charged me $300..phew! Glad it's in perfect condition. Highly recommended!
