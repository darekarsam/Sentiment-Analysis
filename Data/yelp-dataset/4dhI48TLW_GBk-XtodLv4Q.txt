4	My visit was quick. The staff was very knowledgable and I thought over all it was a good experience.
5	Staff is amazing, they are very friendly, knowledgable, & professional. Kevin Kon PA was thorough and incredibly helpful. Candace, his MA was very kind, knowledgable, and patient. I have been very sick & they validated me & are doing what they can to help by running a few different tests. I can truly say, I appreciate them so much & highly recommend them. I wish he could be my primary dr!
1	I went for a pregnancy test after two POSITIVE Pregnancy tests at home.  I was going on vacation to Las Vegas, NV and wanted to be sure if I was pregnant for safety of the baby.  They told me I was NOT pregnant and to continue on my normal daily activities.  I had extreme pain the next day and went to the hospital who confirmed I was indeed pregnant with a urine test and blood test.  The providers will still not remove the charge/fees for this poor medical information that I received!  I would not recommend this place to any friends or family for good medical care and knowledge.
