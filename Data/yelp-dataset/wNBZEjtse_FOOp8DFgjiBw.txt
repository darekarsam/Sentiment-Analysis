5	Went there yesterday to get a full body spray tan for a great deal. I've only gotten a spray tan once, and I wasn't very happy with it...but this one looks so natural! I was surprised at how quick it was, too. Very happy with the color and evenness. I definitely want to book a group deal for my friend's wedding that's coming up!
5	I've been using Organically Bronzed for over a year now and I love it! Adriane is a perfectionist and does an excellent job. I used to use Mystic tanning, but was always left with a drippy, spotty tan. With Organically bronzed I'm left with a golden tan that actually lasts! And the best part of all is I was able to get bronzed up during my pregnancy without the harmful chemicals and fumes. I would recommend her to everyone looking for a great tan without the damaging effects of the sun.
5	Hands down one of the best spray tans I have ever received! I hate streaky yellow/orange tans. Rest assure at organically bronzed your spray tan is also going to come out perfect. The studio is adorable and Adriane (the owner and sprayer) is so welcoming and professional! She has great deals! I will definitely go back!
5	Absolutely love Adriane, the cute location, and above all the most natural looking/ perfect spray tan.  2 months ago I underwent numerous surgeries for skin cancer from tanning in a tanning bed for 9 years (i'm only 25) so getting a great tan has always been my desire and Adriane gave me just that without all the harm from getting a tan from the sun.  I fully recommend Organically Bronzed to anyone you wont regret it :)
