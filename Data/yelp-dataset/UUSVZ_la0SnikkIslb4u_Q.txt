4	The best place for renting videos in Waterloo, far superior to a Blockbuster or Rogers.  They have a good selection of new movies and of classics including foreign films.  It is a pleasure to browse.  You can also check their inventory, but not availability, on their website.  DVD rentals are now $6/day.
5	I have no idea how you could rate this anything but five stars. I've never been a movie store with better selection than Gen X. The clerks are usually having a very peculiar conversation about cult films or the bad reputation of Ringo Starr. At times, I've spent almost an hour staring at genres that I didn't know existed. Gen X is probably the highlight of any term I spend at Waterloo.If you are a student, you can sign up at the beginning of the month $20 and get movie rentals for $3 all term.
3	Generation X is now closed... Thanks for the memories!
