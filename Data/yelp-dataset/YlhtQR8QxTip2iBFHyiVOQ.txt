2	Decent place to a quick and decent brunch....can help but feel a little ripped off by the pricing though.
4	CLOSED DOWN, it is now called Petinos and by far a better breakfast place. Chez Cora started it, but Petinos perfected it.This place has closed down, replaced by PETINOS, great Greek breakfast joint. Yes Gaston is there.Always good service and have been frequenting this joint for a while, staff is very friendly and know most of their customers.  It's breakfast done well and price is reasonable. It gets crazy after 10.30 AM on Sundays, thats when the families with kiddies come in.
