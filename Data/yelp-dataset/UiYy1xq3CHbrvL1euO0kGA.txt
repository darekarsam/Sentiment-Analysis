5	I have not had any problems at this Vet clinic and have heard others say good things about Dr. Montana.  I have always been treated with respect here.  They do not try and get every dollar out of you that they can like at other places.
5	Always so nice . They don't talk you into expensive tests you do need.  Always caring with my dog. My dog is never nervous to go in by herself. Just all around great people here. Cheaper then most places. Quick without undercutting my dogs health concerns. :)
5	I have had dogs my entire life so I've been to my fair share of vets. Dr. Montana is the first vet I have ever been to where I felt he was completely honest and not looking to nickel and dime with various diagnostics that wouldn't really affect the type of treatment we would choose. When my dog of 14 years was diagnosed with lymphoma, Dr. Montana called me at home with the results and gave me all my options and really talked me through what was devastating diagnosis.  When we decided not to do chemo and just keep my boy happy for his time left with us, Dr. Montana actually made me feel so at peace with our decision. The staff at West Olive is also so caring and very accommodating. Many times I have called and they tell me they can get me in that day. They truly care about my dogs and I will recommend Dr. Montana and his staff to ANYONE!!!
5	Dr. Montana is amazing my dogs are happy to see him every time.  I feel he views and treats you from the view of a consumer he tries to keep everything procedure cost effective.  I also like he does not recommend or do unnecessary procedures just to pad a bill. He feels honorable and you know you can trust what he says.
