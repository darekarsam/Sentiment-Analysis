5	This is my favorite Verizon Store!The entire staff is super nice, fun and helpful. Bobby went above and beyond to get me the phone I wanted, sending me reminders and text updates so I would not miss out on the new Iphone :)Thank you guys so much!
4	Great little hidden gem if you want to pick up an iPhone when they first come out.  They usually do not have a long line and the service here is always great.  It is a little place on the SW corner of 101 & Cave Creek and it is normally always empty so you get service here fast.  Highly recommend coming to this location and I know I always will for future purchases.
