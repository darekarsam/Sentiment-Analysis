5	I cannot express how great this place is and the staff. I am a part of a wedding party that was going there for a suit. I was not able to go with the party to get fitted for the suit. Greg, the manager went out of his way to make sure I was taken care of. Even though I wasn't able to get it done at the same time he made sure I wouldn't be left out for this event. I can't thank them enough for their customer service. This will be where I get my suits from here on out.
1	I like Jos A Bank  good suits, good prices  However, this is the worst store I have ever encountered: We were given the briefest of courtesy, we asked two questions and then the staff went off, never to return: After asking two different staff members for help, and being ignored, we left: They weren't busy, mind you - they had two other customers in the store:  They simply could not be bothered.  Go to ANY other Jos A Bank, even if you have to drive an hour:
1	I have never been more disgusted with a store EVER.I heard they were having a clearance and recommended my boyfriend get a suit there.He walked in the door and the sales woman told my boyfriend that he was fat and should "lay off the burritos".This will NOT be the last JoS A Bank hears of this situation.I cannot believe a business would seriously make a potential customer feel bad for their weight.  My boyfriend is a local actor/singer/dancer in the community theater scene in town and has NEVER had an issue with a costumer providing suits/dance pants/jeans, etc EVER.I AM DISGUSTED.
