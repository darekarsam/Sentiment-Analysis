3	Really slow drive through...
5	I LOVE this CVS.  Okay, sometimes the pharmacy is a little slow and they seem to have a lot of different people working here, but that's okay.  When I got into the store to buy stuff, the cashiers are amazing and super helpful.  In fact, they go out of their way to help me save money.  I mean, who does that?  They have saved us TONS of money and that's why we keep coming back.  Love the ladies that work here.  You gals rock!
