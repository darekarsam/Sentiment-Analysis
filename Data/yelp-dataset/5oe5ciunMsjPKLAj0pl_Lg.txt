1	Horrible, horrible service!!! Bad attitude rude BH there yesterday at 6:30pm!! Thank goodness we don't live near this location! I would go off on the corporate office!!
1	Just stopped here. Zero customers, food took forever. Cold fries. Filthy restrooms with no paper towels. No napkins in main lobby. Biscuit was good though. My boyfriend wanted me to add that.
1	Incredibly rude. Waited at the drive thru speaker for two whole minutes with no greeting and when I said hello? The woman replied in a snotty tone, "we will be right with you" I used to work at Jack and I know that one of the non negotiables to greet within the first 5 seconds. I don't understand why she couldn't greet me and tell me to hold on for a second. Never returning here because of her.
3	I tend to frequent other JIB locations as this one has disappointed me in the past, but it was Christmas morning and I wanted to eat before going to see my family, so I went through the drive thru. I got the Supreme Croissant with the hash brown and orange juice. It was ready quickly, the guy at the window wished me a Merry Christmas, and I was on my way. I was pleasantly surprised to find a couple of curly fries in with my hash brown too. Score! I think this JIB has redeemed itself.
