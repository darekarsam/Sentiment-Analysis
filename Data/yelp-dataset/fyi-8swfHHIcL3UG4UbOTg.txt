4	Huge selection of Halloween costumes and props. The little spinning playground merry-go-round with little zombie babies was particularly creepy. The store is large and laid out well. Plenty of costume options for every size and style. I saw some of the items listed as new and hot for 2010 such as Avatar, Jersey Shore and of course all of the vampire craze. I was only there for a few accessories, but I found it quickly with the assistance of the friendly staff. Check out was quick, but I am sure that will get longer as Halloween draws closer. Stop in now and avoid the rush.
1	Bad customer service and the manager does not really  know what's going on.  We were told to come the day to buy props and we had to wait to buy them or for him to figure it out
1	If I could give this place zero stars I would! Horrible employees with horrible attitudes! I can not understand how they expect us to pay $40-$100 for costumes for our children and not allow them to try on the complete costume (masks) being the most important!!! I could care less about the props but how can you tell if it totally fits when you aren't able to actually try it on???!!! I hate this place seriously this is the last year I spend any money at spirit Halloween Id rather make my kids costumes then Spend another dime in these places!
