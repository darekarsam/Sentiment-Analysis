5	Best carpet cleaner in Las Vegas.  Jeff has cleaned my carpet and tile.  Amazing!!!!  I refer everybody to Jeff.  If you think your carpet needs replaced have CR Surface Care take a look.  Honest, reliable and reasonably priced.  My carpets dried fast and the stains never came back.  Jeff takes pride in his work and has the latest and greatest equipment.
5	CR Surface Care is reliable, and efficient! I've had them clean rentals, and even my own home. Great prices, and carpets look like new when he is finished. Honest, trustworthy, and prices are reasonable. I refer Jeff to all my friends looking for carpet and tile cleaning.
5	Thank you Jeff,We are loving the clean carpets in the office! My office carpets were a mess after several months of wear and tear and Jeff came out with his heavy duty cleaning equipment and made it look new. My wife was super impressed with his professional way of doing business and the good quality work. It's so nice to know someone who really cares about every customer. He has also completed several jobs for our customers whom are very impressed with his work!
