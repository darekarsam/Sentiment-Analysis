4	A nice high end portuguese restaurant. Service is good and food delicious. A good niche for Longueuil.
4	Nice atmosphere and very good service. I've ordered a Paella and the seafood wasn't over-cooked (actually, the calamari was just right, not rubbery at all). However, it is a bit pricey for what being served.
