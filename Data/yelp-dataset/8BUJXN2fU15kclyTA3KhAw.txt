5	I use this place for my personal and business needs . Great location and huge selection of candy and tabacco . Buy in bulk or individual items. The employees are genuine and have that no bs attitude that I love .
5	I come here specifically for boxes of Now and Laters to recall my childhood. They have a great selection of candy and have some rare old school production candy .... Candy Cigarettes any one? A lot of people seem to come here for their cigarettes. I think they also have hard to find brands of smokes. If you have a need for for big packages of candy, stop by fort pitt before the other places.
1	Check your candy purchase for FRESHNESS!  I bought 4 boxes of marshmallow cones.  I carried them on a plane to Dallas TX for my adult niece.  When she opened one of the individually wrapped cones, the marshmallow top was as hard as meringue.  I was embarrassed that I gave her old candy that was just purchased days before.  When I returned to pittsburgh I called Fort Pitt.  They said they couldn't do anything unless I returned the candy.  No apology, no concern.  I will not shop there again.  You can find fresh cones and candy at other stores.
