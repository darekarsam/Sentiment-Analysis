2	I go to this Rite-Aid during my work hour sometimes out of necessity for band-aids, skincare items, soda, drinks, and cleaning items/batteries needed for lab supplies. However, if you go to the register and get the grumpy African American female clerk on the far end (I see her almost every day I come in), she mumbles when she talks to customers and I find this rude. I always say thank you with a smile and she barely looks up at me. I continue to smile and say hello to her everytime, but she just seems miserable. I know being a drug store clerk isn't the best job in the universe, but she could at least say "You're welcome!" and smile every once and awhile. Most of the students and UPMC employees that come in don't bite and are fairly friendly, so I don't understand her problem. Oh well. You can't please everyone.
4	Rite-Aid may not be much of the store, but the pharmacy is top notch. I've had nothing but good experiences with the pharmacist there, who knows my face every time; a very friendly fellow. Even if it's a trip out of the way, I always make sure my prescriptions come from this Rite-Aid.
3	Overall, this is a pretty good place to stop in for the quick item if you're in Oakland. I've filled a couple of prescriptions here during a lunch hour at work, and they're usually pretty fast and somewhat knowledgeable about the meds. This location in particular is pretty crazy with all of the traffic, and sometimes they don't have enough people at the front to check everyone out- therefore, an uncomfortably long line usually ensues when I stop in.
