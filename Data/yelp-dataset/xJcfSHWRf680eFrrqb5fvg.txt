4	Great place to rent! Right by The Stratosphere. We had a blast getting around Vegas with mopeds! Cheaper, faster, and much more fun than taxis. Nile, the owner, was very nice. Gave us a good deal and very good customer service. Highly recommend!
1	Worst customer service ever. Stay away. Only got 1 star bc I had to give them one.  UPDATE- they are closed permanently
