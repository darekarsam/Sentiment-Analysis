4	I had a good experience with this place. I am not a huge pho fan to begin with, but decided to try this place for lunch on a work day. I got carryout. The staff was very friendly and my food was ready quickly. The pho was very good and had a lot of meat and veggies in it. The to go set up is really nice and they separate everything for you to mix together yourself. I would recommend based on my experience.
1	The waiter got our our order wrong over and over again. Each time they brought out our food, we weren't sure what we were getting. The servers were nice, it just would have been ideal to get our order correct.... I felt guilty because our egg rolls came out at different times, one girl didn't get her pho until after all of us were eating, and we had to keep requesting things like our water, chopsticks, napkins... Etc. One of us ordered extra meat because the pho has barely in it, and they brought it out practically raw, and with the soup being like warm, we know it won't cook the meat. We're in from out of town, however, I hope locals know better than to spend their time and money here when there are so many other restaurants around.
3	I had the chicken Pho for lunch - to go - and it was good. It came in two containers. The broth in one and all the fixings in the other. I didn't mind adding the fixings. They included hot sauce too. Very well put together for take out. Had all the required utensils etc. I will be back.
