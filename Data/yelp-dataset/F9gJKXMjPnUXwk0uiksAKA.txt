5	This place is another hidden gem in Verdun. This family-run butcher specializes in beef and chicken, and it's really really good. It's decked out with random memorabilia, and the window features a different record label (and quote) each week - this has got to be the butcher with the most character in the province!My favourite thing to get from here is the bambi (cerf) sausages - I can't recommend them enough! They have a wide selection of home-made sausages, and all the ones I've tried have been great. The chicken they sell is grain feed and from Quebec, so it's the good stuff. They also have a selection of cheeses and pates, which are nice to round-out a meal.Another thing I like to go there for is their marinated steaks, all of which are good (my favourite is the spicey one). They also have minced horse meat, which is great for burgers.If you're in the neighbourhood or live not to far, and want fantastic quality meats, then you need to come here.

If someone ever decided to make a film called "Poultry Shop Time Machine" then this is the place to film it.Seriously, walking in I suddenly felt like I was transported to the food shops I used to go to with my mom back in the 1970s as a kid in small-town Quebec. With Montreal Canadians and vintage Quebecois memorabilia, it's really not hard to imagine what a real Mom and Pop stores on Main Street used to look like before giant supermarkets and mega stores drove them out of business.This place has absolutely everything to address your poultry needs and then some. The chickens are all grain-fed and sourced locally in Quebec. I haven't tried the sausages yet but they sure looked tempting. You'll get the same quality of meat here as you would as more expensive locations at Atwater Market or Jean Talon Market - minus the insane markups.I'm glad Verdun still has many shops like these.
