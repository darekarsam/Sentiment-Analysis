5	Hands down the best takeout sushi spot in MTL! #1 Fan
4	A small sushi bar / take out tucked in a small store on Duluth between St. Dominique and Coloniale  makes some of the best sushi in the area. The rice is as it should be: tender but slightly al dente, sticks together but not sticky, the right balance of vinegar and sugar. This is the base for the best sushi ! Fresh ingredients and imagination do the rest: a delightful sushi the way you want to have them.
1	I went to this place with a friend because the reviews were excellent on here and it was a block away from my place. Despite being so close to my place, I wont go back. The miso soup tasted sour...like rotten sour. The sushi wasnt bad but it was pretty small. Thats about it.  I really hoped this could have been a regular spot for me get take-out sushi, but I wont go back :(
