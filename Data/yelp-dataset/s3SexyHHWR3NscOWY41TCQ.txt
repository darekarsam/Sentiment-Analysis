2	Tried a chicken sandwich, duck poutine and lavender lemonade. The lemonade was quite nice and the lavender was quite evident. The duck poutine was very nice but nothing to really write home about. The sandwich had pickled carrots that were interesting, but they also had full peppercorns (black and green), yuck! Who wants full peppercorns in their sandwich. We were looking forward... now we don't have to worry, it's off our bucket list... NEXT!
2	Lucky's duck poutine truck is like the girl at a high school party wearing a sorority jacket, while holding a Louis Vuitton purse in one hand and a PBR in the other. It just doesn't mix well. The fries and cheese are what you expect for a truck (the jacket - hot fries, fresh curds, very average). Nothing special. The shredded duck is tasty but was a bit cold in my case (the purse). The red-onion / wine reduction gravy tries too hard (the PBR). I couldn't taste anything but the wine, as it hadn't been sufficiently reduced, and the alcohol was still too present. I ended up eating the poutine piece by piece, with the duck on the side. What a mess.Sorry - this poutine isn't lucky, it's deservedly a loner.
