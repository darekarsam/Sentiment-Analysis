5	I have taken snow to many groomers and all were ok until this groomer she came out explained and went over what I wanted told me how long it was going to take she was very nice the person at the front was also very nice (maybe the owner?)and answered all my questions I believe this to be our best overall grooming experience the cut came out even better then we talked about and for the price we will be back for sure
1	I purchased a Groupon deal for this groomer, they sold out of the small dog size deal and instead I purchased a medium size, thinking it wouldn't make a difference. I call to double check if it's ok to use this groupon to get my dog groomed when they tell me that they cannot honor it because of the fact that my dog is small and the groupon says it's for a medium-size dog. In my opinion it should not matter if I paid a little extra for medium-size groom when my dog is actually a small dog, I am very upset that I was not able to use this coupon because they made a big deal about it! I will make sure to let my contacts know to avoid this company and to go elsewhere because it doesn't make any sense as to why they wouldn't want to make money doing a small dog groom and me paying for a medium size groom price. It's very disappointing that they won't be getting any money from me!
5	Bought a Groupon thinking I would get what I paid for, a discounted grooming. Man was I shocked when I picked up our two Australian Shepard's. What a beautiful job puppy love did on our girls. Maggie nick named bear for her size and thick hair has never looked so good. I highly recommend puppy love groomers and put there level of expertise up against all groomers in this town. Thank you and look forward to their next appointment.
