5	Used Ann Marie for a Valentine's Day delivery for my wife.  Couldn't have been more satisfied.  We had a 2 week old in the house so I didn't have time to visit a florist and could barely sneak away to make a phone call. Corresponded w/ Ann Marie exclusively via e-mail.  Ordered, paid, set delivery time all over the net....showed up on time and perfect.  Would def recommend and will use her again!
5	Ann Marie was so helpful! She was quick to return my phone call and help me with my order. She recommended an arrangement for me and was prompt with delivery! I will definitely keep her in mind for the future.
5	Wow.  I called this shop last week for a delivery yesterday for my mom's birthday.  I was hesitant because I've only ever ordered flowers online from the national places.  I didn't really know what kind of flowers I wanted, but I had an amount in mind I wanted to spend.  Ann Marie was so great.  I mentioned I liked an arrangement on her site and we talked about what was available and colors.  She said she'd put something together and charge me the amount I was looking to spend.  My mom received her flowers yesterday and was blown away.  These are BEAUTIFUL and HUGE!!  The quality is so much better than I've seen and the size is such a better value!  I will be using this shop from now on.  Totally won me over.
