4	Clean play yard, fast fresh food. Everything is nice and new and clean. Let's hope it stays that way. The fountain drinks aren't watered down like at most fast food places. I like to ask for unsalted fries later in the day to make sure I get fresh ones.
1	Ordered an onion biurger, and fries, that were very greasy and soggy. Go to this location often.  Called the number to voice my concern, and after a couple of days, no return call, no email.  A   sad tale of bad customer service.  Thank goodness there are many other fast food places that would like my business.
