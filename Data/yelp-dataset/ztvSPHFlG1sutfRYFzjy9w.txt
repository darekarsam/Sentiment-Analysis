3	This small store boasts a variety of pottery made locally. Although (from my limited backround in pottery-making) it is on the pricey side, it still is quite cute and could easily offer a last minute gift option to someone.Also it's a very cute shop to browse in and Paul and Junko (the pottery makers) are very friendly and good to chat with about clay making.
4	I love to see places like this that still exist, old fashioned traders making everything by hand! I don't know the first thing about Pottery so all I'll say is that the stuff looks very impressive. Unusually colorful for pots with all different kinds of finishing on them. One downside, custom pots can take up to 6 weeks to make so book ahead.
4	Archaeologists say that a culture's pottery defines and drives a society. if that is the case then Meadows Pottery might be the last bastion of our crumbling civilisation. We don't exactly have many commercial homegrown potters left, so it's nice to stumble upon a place like Meadows Pottery.A small shop, Meadows Pottery offers vases, jugs, plates, decorations all sorts, all of simple design and colour. The pottery is nice, at the very least, with its easy-on-the-eye aesthetic, it is hard to dislike. I don't find it stunning, and so I do have problems with the prices, but I think the sort of market its aimed at will have less of a problem with this.A pleasant and unexpected potters in the heart of Edinburgh.
