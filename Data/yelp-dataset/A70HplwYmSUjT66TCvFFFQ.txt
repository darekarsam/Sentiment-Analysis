5	This is hands down (beautifully manicured hands) the nicest nail salon in town! Comfy massage chairs, ultra clean and modern and super nice staff.  We came in for the special but will be back even once the 50% off special is over.
5	We came here as a recommendation from a friend. We were not disappointed,  JD was great,  he was friendly and very funny,  We even got to watch movies while we sat in the massage chairs. This place has 6 nail stations and 6 pedi stations. The prices are very reasonable too.
5	Love, love, love this nail salon!  They have completely redesigned it and the tile work is gorgeous...I've never seen a salon like this.  JD is awesome and super personable!  I had never done an accent nail but tried it today and left with probably the cutest design ever!!!
4	I came here when they were having a half off everything special.  Even though I was paying half the price, they still gave me great service and spent plenty of time on me.  While you are getting a pedicure, you get to sit in massage chairs and watch movies! I also had my eyebrows waxed.  The lady did such a great job. I think I will return.Normal pricesPedicure: $24Eyebrow waxing: $10
4	Professional and great customer service. I appreciated that they called me by name and did great work. The price was good ($22 for basic pedi) plus a 20% discount which was a pleasant surprise. If I lived in the area I'd be more than happy to go back again.
