4	I like coming here with a group of people. I think this place may be able to claim they have the cheapest prices in Shadyside. Although many have said that this is pretty much a 'meathead' joint/sausage fest, I think the same could be said of other shadyside bars (william penn, doc's, etc.) I give the saloon four stars because it's near my house, has cheap drinks, and plenty of space. Usually dead on the weekdays.
4	Many a memorable (albeit fuzzily so) night at this bar when I was in PGH knocking on doors for the Obama campaign.  I'm convinced.
3	One of the few bars, seemingly, in America where people can smoke inside.  It's a fun place - darts and KARAOKE!  Just be warned that this place can get smokey.  Not a place to hang all night... stop in a grab a beer before hitting other places on Ellsworth.
5	Great place to go. Friday and Saturdays are busy. Good prices for shady side.
2	This bar smells like a smoky urinal cake, all the time.I only go in to buy six packs.  The bar staff seems nice enough.  It def seems like a frat crowd.They get 2 stars only bc there is a skee ball machine.
1	I am in the service industry and my friends and I came here for my birthday. It was the worst experience and the bartender wouldn't give us lemons or limes for our drinks. She was rude and all over the place. We would have spent a lot of money but she deterred us from that.
