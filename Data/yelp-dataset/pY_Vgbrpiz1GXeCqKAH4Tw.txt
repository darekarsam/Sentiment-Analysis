5	My 3 year old had her first real dentist appointment yesterday and she did great! The office staff and Dr. Ramsey are so friendly! I also think it helped that there was a train in the waiting room! I know she can't wait to go back again...she was so excited that she brushed twice after we got home! :-)
5	We've been coming here for semi annual cleaning for the past 8 years. They certainly know how to work with kids. They make sure kids are comfortable and they work with you to have positive image towards dentist.  My kids can't wait to come back here every six months.Waiting room is nicely set up. My kids used to love watching the train goes around forever. Plenty of toys to keep kids entertained. Lots of magazines for parents and free WiFi to keep me busy while waiting.
5	We love Dr. Ramsey and his staff!! We found him 9 years ago when, as foster parents, we needed a dentist covered by our foster son's insurance. We loved the practice so much we transferred all of our children to his care and have been there ever since!! He is very thorough, and puts all of my children at ease. The staff is always so friendly and helpful, flexible and eager to serve! I have full confidence in Dr. Ramsey, Vicki, Gloria, and Cheri!!
