1	Quality is really bad but as the only 24 hour place around Concordia, I guess it'll have to do
5	24 hours. Very cozy! I enjoy the hot chocolate or the apple cider the most! Has free Wi-fi and quiet enough to get some studying done!
1	We saw a bird flying around the restaurant, walking on the furniture and eating crumbs off the tables. When I approached staff, they said the bird lived there and had a nest up in the ceiling. Plus, my husband said the bathrooms were the dirtiest he had ever visited...worse than at some truck stops!
3	A nice 24h coffeeshop opened next to the downtown campus of Concordia University, one of its bad points would be that it's always crowded with students: finding a place to sit can be a challenge during 'study peak time'.Otherwise, it's always a fast service, polite workers behind the counter, and they do offer a nice variety of sweet desserts and snacks.For me, Second Cup is always better than Starbuck as a coffeeshop big chain!
