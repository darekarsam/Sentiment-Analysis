4	I love the new Spicy Chicken Biscuit.  The staff here is awesome and your order is turned around very quickly.  I love it here!
3	Honestly can't say I can actually be a fan of Chick-Fil-A, but this place has nothing wrong! I enjoy the food here, just not a fast food type of person. I came here early early morning to pick up some breakfast for my parents. They were helpful, courteous, and nice. I didn't have any problem with them and didn't get my order wrong (I would hope not since I was the first customer.)If you're craving for a fast food joint, I think Chick Fil A could be the healthiest out of the choices. I'm not a fan of fast food so that's why I'm going to give them 3 stars.
3	This location is closest to my home so I used to get the chick-fil-a sandwich until I learned there is some dairy.  I'm not anti-dairy, but my nursling has an allergy so I have to be careful.  The dude who knocked off stars for it being fast food should have his review deleted.  I don't go to a jewelry store looking for tires. Unbelievable.It's a darn tasty sandwich!  Fries are good too!  And I would have given them 5 stars BUT the super nice mgr at the Chick-fil-A near the Airport made mine special -WITHOUT the egg/milk wash.  When I asked the woman behind the counter here, I was told they would not. But if you're being careful with dairy and soy it's best to avoid eating out altogether.
5	Best service around!  Friendly staff and food is always fresh. Great theme nights for kids.
5	I just love this place.  We do not eat fast food at all however, I do not consider this place fast food.  This is an extended part of the family.  They treat me and my kids like their own.  We always feel special when they call us by name and generally cares about you!  Thank you so much!
5	These employees are truly awesome. I've never seen a fast food restaurant care so much about its customers. Especially one w a toddler. So great.
