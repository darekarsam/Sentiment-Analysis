1	This hands down has some of the worst customer service! I don't know what crawled up this woman's butt or maybe she hates what she is doing (*Newsflash* if you are miserable doing the job that you do quit or change it!)There are other Sally's I will go to, but this on will never see me and my business again!
3	I don't know which person helped Raquel, but the girl at the counter when my daughter and I popped in was helpful and nice. She did suggest that we have a "blessed" day, which is interesting but not a problem.Three long aisles of doodads and accessories and hardware so that women can make themselves up with warpaint and curlers and all sorts of stuff. My daughter simply needed a replacement makeup brush to replace the one that the cats "stole" and chewed up. Found it. Bought it (cheap) and we were back on our way.This probably isn't a "browse" sort of store. Either you know what you want when you walk in, or you don't. I can't imagine women shop here and have "Oh, that tool might be useful" experiences.
4	This is my preferred store when I have hair needs and I'm not heading to my stylist for a few days... The workers are always helpful and they know about the products they sell, so they can offer suggestions...  I've gone for a few items and they've been spot on about the descriptions and what they can do for my hair... I have been very pleased with my service each and every time I've been here (which is more than I can say for the beauty supply store across the parking lot.)... It's fairly priced but some of the items are a little expensive... I mean, what are you going to do, though?  It's your hair... Suck it up and splurge...
