1	I will never go this subway again. It was Monday night and I paid for the sandwich and cup of water. The fountain pop machine is next to the where you pay the cashier. The guy (cashier) standing next to the fountain machine told me that make sure you don't hit the back of water as it dispense Lemonade even though I was filling cup with "Water" and he could see it. I believe his name starts with "Y". I asked him have you seen me filling lemonade and why would you say that to customer when I am not doing it. He said that he can say anything to customer and its his right. I asked him for his Subway Owner number and he mentioned he is the owner and he refused to give it to me. I know he is not the owner and just an employee. I was so mad why would you say to customer like this. This subway has the least professional employees and the girl who made my sandwich kept complaining that owner called him to work and she is not supposed to work that day. You don't talk to customer like this....I would have given zero stars to this location.
1	I have stopped at this location TWICE now for breakfast, once last week on Tuesday May 7th, 2013 at 7:48 am and again today Monday May 13, 2013 at 7:40 am and this location has been CLOSED both times. Their hours of operation are clearly posted on the door and on their website as 7:00 am to 10:00 pm. I would suggest with the amount of morning traffic and business that is driving right by that you either open when your hours state, or change the hours to reflect the hours you plan on being open.
