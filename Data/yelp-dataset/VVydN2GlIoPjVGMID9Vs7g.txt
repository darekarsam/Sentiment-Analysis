4	Split over five levels, the City Art Centre hosts regularly changing exhibitions spanning a very diverse range of themes. To give you a flavour, my last visit included a superb and fascinating exhibition on the real-world applications of Drawing, a celebration of Ancient Historical Monuments in Scotland and an exploration of Space Age-themed design. Over several visits I've always been impressed with the quality of the exhibitions, which have been interesting and very well thought out, researched and presented - often with some interactive elements as well. Well worth a trip, especially as a lot of the exhibitions are free to visit.
