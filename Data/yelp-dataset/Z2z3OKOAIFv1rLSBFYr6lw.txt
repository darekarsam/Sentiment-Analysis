3	We ended up having dinner here as it happened to be the closest establishment to the theatre, that isn't creepy or seemed to be run by the Russian mafia. Anyway, we entered and found ourselves in a quiet dining area. There were only 4 tables occupied, so there weren't a lot of people. We ordered two chicken dishes, and they both came with rice. They came on time, and it was quite edible. However, they were not spectacular. I have been to better Chinese restaurants, and this is just average. So I am giving them 3 stars. My chicken with black fungus was quite tasty, as well as the breaded fried chicken cutlet with stir-fry. The service was okay, nothing spectacular. Although I do like the fact that they have these heating devices on the table to keep the dishes warm. That being said, I missed using the chopsticks, which they didn't provide. Perhaps they did have them, if I asked, but as we were in a hurry, I didn't bother.If I want Chinese, I probably would look for other places before coming here, as the location is a little creepy at night, and I know there would be better places.
