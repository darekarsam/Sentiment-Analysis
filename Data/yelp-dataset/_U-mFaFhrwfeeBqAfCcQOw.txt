5	Aghhhh I love ICE CREAMSo this place is right across the street from my apartment. I came here in high hopes not to be disappointed and sure enough I wasn't. My dads family is from Michoacan so I know what the ice cream should taste like. This place has exactly that. The ice cream is creamy and full of flavors. They make their own ice cream which is a plus.This place also has fresh made flavored waters. For example horchata, mango, limon, melon, and etc. Plus they have Botanas aka Mexican snacks. They will put what ever you want on you ice cream I always get the nuez ice cream with coconut and chocolate.They also have outside seating where you can just watch the the cars and people outside.
1	This place is soo overrated.   As a girl who grow up in Mexico i'd like to say i'm so disappointed in this place everything is so blah and not tasty. It's because they go cheap on their ingredients sacrificing flavor and taste.  I thought this place was gonna be really authentic and natural ingredients but it's not, i'll never come back here again.  I can make way better raspados and churros locos at home. What a waste of money it's kinda pricey too.
