5	6/14/13 - Good service and excellent prices! I priced the same exact parts across the street at the "big name" pool supply store and NPS was 40% cheaper!!! Do yourself a favor and go to NPS for your pool supplies to save a lot of money.Edited to add: I went back in today, 6/16/13, to get a Pentair coupling that was priced close to $300. I spoke to the salesman and asked if he'd match Amazon's price that was half that and he did it with a smile! Outstanding customer service!
5	Super friendly staff.  One of the smaller locations but I got what I needed and was in and out super quick
5	the nps pool supply store on west flamingo has 2 very nice people, diane and chris, who go the extra mile when it comes to customer service and knowledge of products needed. i recommend them before going to leslie's pool supply.
