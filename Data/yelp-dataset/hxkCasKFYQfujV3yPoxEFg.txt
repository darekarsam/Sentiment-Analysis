2	This place is great if you don't mind waiting obscenely long time for drinks.  We visited this place because we wanted a martini before dinner. We ordered a dirty martini and a Bombay sapphire martini (extra $3 during the 5-7pm happy hour--martinis free with each order of tapas, something like that).  We order the fried potatoes with rosemary and fried calamari.  Both were good, tasty, light and would have gone perfectly with the martinis had we got them in time.  It took over 30 minutes to get our drinks. When we got them, the dirty martini was more like a olive juice and gin.  To the waiters' credit, they were very accommodating, took the dirty martini back and replaced it, free of charge.  they earned their tip for sure.
3	This place was decent for tapas, but not the best I've ever had.  Highlights were the shrimp in piri-piri sauce, the cod with olive tapenade and chick pea sauce (hummus?), and the scallop (just one! don't be fooled) in the butternut squash soup.  The oyster mushrooms were bland and very so-so, especially after they cooled down after a couple minutes.  Service was just okay... nothing to really praise them about, but they did their job and it was fine.  The wine I had, a glass of white wine - Albis maybe? - was crap.  I didn't say anything about it, but I definitely was discouraged from ordering any other drink.  Steer clear of it!
1	I visited their new location in The Village (1654 rue Sainte-Catherine East) and experienced the most terrible dining ever.  S L O W service, mixed-up orders, miniscule portions, exorbitant prices.  There is no reason to ever eat here.
