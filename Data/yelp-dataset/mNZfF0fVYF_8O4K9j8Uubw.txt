4	Friendly staff. Fresh eats. What's not to love? Nom nom nom!
4	Just tried the Fritos enchilada melt. Not a bad lunch. Had to try it... Not sure Id get another one. It gets a little busy during lunch so the staff just focuses on getting you in and out. If i eat there i'll usually pick the meatball marinara or the buffalo chicken.
1	Good is great here. But one member of staff constantly screws up my order. Every time i go in Pedro either screws up my sandwich or doesnt ring up an item and then tries to over charge me for it. Take for instance today. I got my usual bmt. With chips and drink and i added a soup. So after the transaction is rang up he starts yelling at me for making a drink. And i had said yes and made eye contact while i said yes.  So he tries to charge me over 2$ extra for my drink so i demanded that he rings up the whole order again because i am not being ripped off by this man again. I will not return to this subway again if Pedro is still working here. He obviously has some kind of language barrier or blatantly does not listen to people.
