5	The Dragon is actually in the Bell Tower, (Many Dragons fly, and the Sacred Heart "roost" provides a sturdy point for landing.)Years ago one of the big clappers fell during the 12:30 Mass, and part of the tower flooring splintered onto the pews.  People in the know avoided that section of the church for years.The basement is strewn with nooks and crannies because of the requirements of the building's struts buttresses, and weight requirements for the altar and reredos.
5	Large, beautiful church with good Masses and good homilies.   My family and I have been to a number of churches in the area, but Sacred Heart has everything we were looking for. There is a good demographic mix of young adults, young families, and older adults. Highly recommend!
