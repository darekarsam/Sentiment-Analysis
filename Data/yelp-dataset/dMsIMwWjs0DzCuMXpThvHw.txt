1	He took some photos of my son, and I never received them.  I left him several messages before he ever called me back, and when he did his attitude couldn't have been any more rude.  He claimed he delivered them, and treated me like I was owed nothing.  I ended up asking for my money back, and told him to forget about the pictures.  We'll see if I get it back.  He did offer to reprint the pics, and send them a few weeks later.  When I asked him why it would take a few weeks his response was "do you want them or not?".  I just don't do business with people who treat customers like this.  I hope you don't either.I would never use him again!
5	I called Mr. Mueller to see if he would possible be able to take some head shots of me.  I knew it was a last minute request but when asking him he was very willing to fit me in and take the shots for me.  While at the shoot he was funny, entertaining and very professional.  I am not big with taking pictures but he made it so much fun.  I really had a lot of fun taking them.  I had proofs sent to me within 24 hours and the head shots were amazing.  It was perfect service and I will definitely use Mr. Mueller in the future.
5	At Growth Nation we're very particular on the vendors we use for photography.  Right now there are only two because of high quality and good price - and one of those is Rick Mueller Photography.  Rick has been in business here in Scottsdale since the 1970's (!) and he continues to bring value to his clients. Highly recommended.
