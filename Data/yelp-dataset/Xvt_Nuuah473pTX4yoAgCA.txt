4	This is more than the category of ice cream & frozen yogurt.  This is gelato =)  Om nom nom...When I saw the Nutella flavour I knew that I had to build my trio around that.  Adding dark chocolate and almond to the mix and I had the perfect treat for a hot day.  The boy decided to build a fruit based trio and it was just as delicious as mine...but not by much =PI really liked that these were small portions that were perfectly filling without being over powering and too sugary.  Prices were pretty reasonable but be warned.  They had a sign on the till that they didn't accept cards so bring cash!!
4	What luck! The rest of our party stopped at the ice cream shop across the street, but I held out for something less franchisey. Turns out this gelateria was just steps away over the cobblestones, but miles ahead in character and content. The young girl behind the counter was welcoming, reasonably conversant in English, and eager to please. As I gazed across the options, she caught the track of my eye and scooped four sample spoons without my asking and all were delicious. Cherry was more sour than I wanted, but raspberry was bright and smooth. I was tempted by amaretto and tiramisu, but the creamy caramel just seemed right and I ended with an unlikely pairing in the smallest dish. Totally satisfying treat in the warmly lit street.I'll reveal I have little experience with gelato -- ice cream is my usual -- so I can't honestly rate its quality, but this sure seemed like the real deal.
5	Stopped in with some friends while visiting. The gelato was delicious, the prices were good and the people were very helpful. I got Nutella with Ferrero Rocher and did NOT regret it, let me tell you. The cups look small but they put a hefty scoop in.There's a $10 credit card minimum, so I'd advise bringing cash unless you're ordering for more than 1-3 people.
5	Great gelato. The prices are reasonable and the servings are plentiful!They have a ferrero rocher gelato which is incredible!
