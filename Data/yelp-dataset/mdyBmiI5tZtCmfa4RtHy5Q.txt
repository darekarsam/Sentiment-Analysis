5	The people there went out of their way to help me.  They were so nice and friendly
1	Sloooooooooooow.  And will tack on random charges.
4	My favorite thing about this FedEx location would have to be the hours!  I have been here close to midnight and have been here at 6 am and they are always open.  Though they are not open 24/7 it sure feels like they are.  The staff is pleasant and knowledgeable. They also have a good amount of supplies like notepads and folders that aren't too badly priced.  There is also loads of parking cause I mean, how busy can a FedEx really get?  All in all great location, no complaints!
