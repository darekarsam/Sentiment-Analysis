5	Karen has become a member of our family...When it comes to someone that will truly care about you and what you need in a home, you could not ask for anyone better. It seems difficult to find individuals that truly love their job with conviction, but there is no doubt that Karen is one of those individuals. She made sure to guide us every step of the way and when something needed to be resolved, it was done as quickly and efficiently as it could be. I am glad that we found Karen as our agent and look forward to using her services as long as we may live in Arizona.
5	Karen Berg is an absolute joy to work with, she is highly ethical in everything she does, very responsive and willing to go above and beyond to meet the needs of her friends and clients! She is extremely knowledgeable about Arizona's real estate market and her passion for her business and her clients sets her apart as one of the very best! I would highly recommend Karen Berg to anyone who is looking for a fabulous local real estate expert!
5	We have purchased homes in the past and have always had issues with our realtors until we met Karen. She was very knowledgeable and even though we were very particular in what we wanted she was able to find us our dream home. Her professionalism and attention to detail when we made our offer actually made the owners pass up a better offer and choose ours. Karen walked us through the whole process and set up all the appointments which allowed us to focus on securing the loan. She answered all our questions and treated us more like long time friends than just clients. Even after we had closed on the house Karen remembered my daughters birthday and took the time to send her a card. Karen was an absolute blessing and I am extremely thankful to her for all she did for us. I will recommend Karen to anyone I know who is looking for a new home!
