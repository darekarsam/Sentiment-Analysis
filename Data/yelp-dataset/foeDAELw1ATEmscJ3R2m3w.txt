4	Well, it's a McDonald's... Standard service, no bad experiences so far. The McDonald's experience expected from a McD.
3	Not the worst McDs in town. I often judge McDs on hygiene and this place was fine. Not the best but passable.
2	Tried the new Med. Signature Veggie McWrap here and it looks like I was missing a quarter of it... certainly didn't look like the pictures where you see it coming out of the top. Makes me want to quote Wendy's old slogan of "Where's the beef" except here it's the veggies. Really, you need to be so cheap on the vegetables? There's no meat.... pile it on, people. On mine, you have to do a picture from above to see anything inside which left me feeling duped! Even if you are doing take-out, you still have to fill your own soda. They were having the dollar-days for coke and was charged the regular price until I pointed it out.
