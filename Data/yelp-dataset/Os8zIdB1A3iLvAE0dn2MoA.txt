5	QuikTrip has a great selection of food and beverages. The store is always immaculate and the staff is extremely polite and helpful.
4	First visit!  Hoping to find lunch!   A quick lunch pick up since this new QT is right down the street from my work place.  I took advantage of the $5 lunch with a classic club sandwich, smokehouse potato salad and the large drink.  The selection of brewed teas and coffees is just as endless as I had heard.  I custom blended my iced tea with sweetened passion fruit black tea and unsweeted regular tea after giving several different ones a taste.  My sandwich was super fresh on thick slabs of brown bread and the potato salad was tasty as well. The entire facility was really clean and there were lots more choices for prepared foods as well as standard service station fare.  There will be a QT soon in my neighborhood and I am looking forward to the gas prices and the number of refill stations, too.  Funny aside, I was asked not to photograph the store until I told them it was for a Yelp review and then they were more than happy to let me continue!
2	Never go between 12 am and 5 am , if you want good service or even buns. No hot foods barely. There is a girl with pink coach shoes that is RUDE, and has an attitude.  I got sweet tea there and it was unsweetened. There hustlers outside asking you for money. Good luck with that store.
1	What's the point of yelp if you delete negative comments?
5	Best coffee and soda drinks section that I have ever encountered in a service station. As for the gas, it is a very wide pump area.
