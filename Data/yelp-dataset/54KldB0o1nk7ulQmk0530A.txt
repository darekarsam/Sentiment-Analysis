4	We needed to have a tree removed and went about searching for companies to give us estimates.  We found Wholesale Tree Removal online and added them to our list.  Scott, the owner, was proactive in getting in contact with us (unlike some others who kept us waiting for days to get their bid).  We got an estimate the next day and Scott followed up with us again a few days after that.  Scott and his crew were at our house when they said they would be.  They did a great job removing our tree and grinding the stump and we are perfectly pleased with the way it turned out.  Would use them again in the future.
1	I filled out the form on their website, twice, for a free estimate. That was two months ago. I was never contacted. Thanks!
5	I really appreciated the work Scott and his crew did.  It was over 114 degrees fahrenheit today, but they took care of all 4 trees and did a great job.  Also, the branches and trunk they needed to cut were so large that a few of our sprinklers got knocked out of place but they fixed them right up.  My husband and I disagreed on one point and they even offered to come back for free when we agreed on what to do.  I couldn't ask for more.
5	I filled out a request for an estimate on Sunday expecting a call Monday or Tuesday instead I got a call on Sunday about 5:00 pm kindly asking if it was ok to talk this late on a weekend.  Scott came out and gave me a fair estimate, showed up when he said and did all the work as stated. The trees look great ( 6 very large Palo Verdes), the service was excellent and I would recommend Wholesale Tree Trimming and Scott to anyone who asks.
