4	Nice location, we went on an off night and service was fast and friendly.I got the giant 'Deluxe Bacon Cheeseburger' and it was great!  Tons of cheddar shacked high, took some real work to eat this as tall as it was.We're definitily planning a return visit once we cycle through a few of the other local restaurants.
