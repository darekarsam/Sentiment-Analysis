5	A very well done cleaning, I'm very happy with this company and I will continue to use their services
5	I bought a Groupon because I needed help getting my home ready for guests.  They were able to schedule me on two days' notice.  Indira showed up right on time.  She was friendly, courteous and she worked her butt off for two hours.  Her quote for ongoing service was in line with other quotes I've received.  I'm very satisfied and will definitely use this service again.
5	This is a company I want to support and encourage people to use!!  Super work ethic and attention to detail.  Honest, hard working people.  I did not even realize how dirty my floors were until they were cleaned so well !  Highly recommend Pro Clean.
