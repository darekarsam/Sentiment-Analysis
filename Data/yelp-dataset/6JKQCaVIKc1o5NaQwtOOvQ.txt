5	Loved using Ollie the Trolley for wedding transportation last year!  It was plenty roomy of course, but I was shocked how many people commented that they loved the fact that we used a local trolley.  Price was reasonable and the drivers were prompt!  They even let us make a few unplanned stops for snacks, aka beer. :-)  Thanks Ollie, you rock!
1	Unfortunate  what the trolly has done to our scottsdale streets. I have lived in Scottsdale since 1995 and it seems that every year the trolly stops have gotten worse but now they will pull over anywhere and let people on or off. the proplem with this is there are no trash recepticles and the streets are being littered upon. look at these stops and you will see transients/drunks waiting for a free ride to cool down in the heat, i have seen more police at these designated stops and would not let my son or daughter ride them, they have turned to the copper square transportation system (hobo bus). this is sad to see and hope that scottsdale puts and end to this soon or fixes these issues. The stop that seems to be the worse is on Scottsrdale rd and Roosevelt.
4	Ollie the Trolley is a cool way to get around Scottsdale and the surrounding area.  Especially during Spring Training when they add several more trollies and you can get around to the two stadiums in Scottsdale without having to find a parking space.Before we moved here we visited a few friends who took us on the trolley and since then it's been one of those signature Scottsdale images that I have in my mind.  We always recommend it to our visitors.Return Factor - 90%
