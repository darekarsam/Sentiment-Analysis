5	This is perhaps the best mechanic shop in Pittsburgh.  It is ran by two brothers and may not look like much but they offer excellent service, honest work and great pricing.  Recently I brought my truck in after another shop said I needed a litany of repairs.  At Bruno's they did only the necessary work and even fixed the ignition switch which had worn out and only charged me for the part.  These guys are great, but they are usually backed up with work so you may have to schedule in advance.
5	Bruno's is by far the best garage I've ever taken my car to, either here in Pittsburgh or in Los Angeles where I used to live. I drive a 2000 Saab, so believe me, I have A LOT of experience getting my car repaired. The two brothers who own Bruno's are great. They are very knowledgeable, they're very willing to help you and, above all, they're honest, which I've found is a  rare commodity when it comes to mechanics. I cannot possibly recommend Bruno's highly enough.
5	Absolutely amazing guys here! We were in Pittsburgh visiting my family and the driver's seatbelt stopped working. Day after Thanksgiving and these guys got us in despite obviously being incredibly busy.  It turns out that a piece of plastic had gotten stuck in the buckle. Now we are able to drive home. Thanks!!!!!
