5	Wonderful store the most exquisite products. I got bamboo bath towels, a couple presents for friends including beautiful baby clothes, and little bunny slippers.  After finding the items I came in for, the wonderful owner Laura then helped me to redo my guest room. I ordered stunning bedding from a catalog and swatches,  Laura helped me visualize everything and I am so excited for their arrival because I have never had such nice things....Price is similar to Norsdtrom but I think you get what you pay for and I love the customer service and quality that Nestldown provides.
5	I went into this store with the intention of buying a bathrobe for my boyfriend as he didn't have one (what???) and the owner I think Laura was amazing.  Super nice.. guided me to a beautiful and soft one and I wound up buying two matching ones for both of us.  Such a cute store too.. if I redo my bedroom soon I will definitely come here!
5	I stopped in here on the hunt for quality quest towels for my new office.  Laura took me to exactly what I was looking for in under 20 seconds...then I stayed much longer to visit.  Nice place with soft, luxurious linens merchandised like a true pro.  Laura is super-sweet and fun.
