5	I followed Roberto (cut) and Ray (color) to the new Studio Cento when they left Toni & Guy.  It is a gorgeous and relaxed salon and I feel like part of the family there!  I never have to worry about getting a bad hair cut or color.  I've been to many salons all over Scottsdale and Phoenix and I feel Ray and Roberto are two of the best in the valley.  They are very good at what they do and very, very dependable and flexible.  I would not hesitate referring anyone to either one of them.  I consistently get compliments on my hair!  Love the location too - it's on 5th Avenue but in an area tucked away from the normal hustle and bustle of Old Town.  Great job on the new salon and thanks for bringing me with you!! p.s. I forgot to mention that Ray and Roberto have been styling my hair since 2003 so I feel this is a pretty reliable review!!  :)
5	Love coming here! Everyone is always extremely friendly, courteous, and professional. Ray does my color and Leti does my cut and they both do a phenomenal job. I'd highly recommend Studio Cento to anyone!
5	Caren and Misty are THE BEST! They've been taking care of my cut and color for years..and I always am complimented on my hair... I highly recommend!!
5	Misty and Caren are amazing! If you want your hair cut and colored go see these ladies. You will love the results.
