2	Good service,  and they had decaf coffee ready (not instant or lattes only like most MTL places); toast was excellent, but the eggs, potatoes,  and pancake were just "ok". "Fruit" was laughable, more like garnish.
2	I went for breakfast with my gf and we were quite disappointed. We ordered an omelet and it was cold. The potatoes that came with the omlet were also cold.  The coffee was relatively hot. It wasn't worth the $30 that's for sure. I could have made a better breakfast myself in 10 minutes.
3	Decent food, fruits were not as fresh as I'd like. Waffles were a bit dry, eggs however were excellent.
