5	This place is great. The ambience is very casual the prices are very low. The menudo is well worth your time. All you can eat for only six dollars.
5	New Place in town. I love all their food. The carne Asada burrito with beans is the best. The service was great and very friendly and helpful. I will tell my friends about this good place for Mexican food.
5	This is authentic Mexican food the way it is meant to be. I especially have fallen in love with the enchiladas, but the burrito, flautas and chimichangas also have been quite tasty. Service is friendly, too. The only thing I wish for is a homier ambiance. Because it is a square space in a strip mall, it has the feeling of a square space in a strip mall. Some authentic rugs on the walls, a little more vibrant color and better furniture would help. But go there for the tasty food!     Well, that didn't take long. Days after this review, over Thanksgiving Thursday and Friday (2014), The owners added some nice booths, new furniture and opened an addition by cutting into the space next door that used to be a little fitness center. Well done!
4	Yummy food, great service, highly recommend!Ordered for pick up food for 8 people and they got it all right with a good price too.Highly recommend the enchilada combo!
5	Great service, fresh ingredients, food made to order and correct. Wonderful staff. We are from Napoleon, MI visiting family and everyone was very pleased with their meals.Highly recommend for an affordable, yummy meal.
3	Located in a shopping area west of town, this restaurant has little to offer in the way of ambiance or atmosphere, but the food was good, and the service prompt and friendly. The menu has the usual expected entrees; I had an acceptable chili relleno combo, which was satisfying, but not exceptional. It was about the best I've had in Wickenburg, which maybe isn't saying a whole lot, but still. No alcohol, so no beer or margaritas.
