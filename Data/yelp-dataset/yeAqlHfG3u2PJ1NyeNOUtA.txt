5	Michael and staff are super friendly and knowledgeable. Good selection of comics, along with shirts, games, toys, and other cool stuff. They just opened, but are off to a great start!!
4	New comic shop in Gilbert. Michael the owner was very friendly and took time answer all my questions. Good selection of current comics. Doesn't appear they have back issues. Prices were good. I'll be back.
5	I was surprised they were open on Christmas Eve. I was able to get my last minute shopping knocked out. Good selection of books and trinkets. The owner Michael, helped me pick out a few things that are sure to please the kiddos. I will be back with the kids as they host table games.
5	Great store! Very clean and well organized. There are two small tables in the back for Magic. Shopkeeper super friendly.
