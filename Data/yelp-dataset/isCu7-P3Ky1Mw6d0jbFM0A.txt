2	I think the best part of the meal was when the waiter argued with us over whether or not we ordered 3 bowls of rice (for 3 people).Skip this one folks...
3	This place is easy to miss.  Is in the basement.  I went for lunch, ate the general Thai and quite enjoyed it.Atmosphere is mediocre, what I would expect for the area, service was very good.I think I will Try one more spot in China town this week as I still haven't found my gem in the rough there...Accepts Amex, which I always like.
2	Came here for my birthday. Expecting to eat something rather tasty, but turned out to be pretty disappointing expereince. The ambiance, and the service was really good, however the food was not up to par. Not very authentic.
