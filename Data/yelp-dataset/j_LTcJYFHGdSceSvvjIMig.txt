2	For a "fruiterie", they don't actually have a lot of different fruit to choose from, and most of it doesn't look very fresh. You're really better off going to a supermarket. Most of the space is actually taken up by tea, spices, and other dry goods. Likewise, not a particularly interesting selection of them. It's cheap, at least.
