5	Was recommended by a long time Gilbert resident.  Cory has treated my family and our cars right.  His shop is the kind of local business that doesn't advertise but relies on word-of-mouth referrals.  It's not just the quality of work that satisfied me, but the treatment and price.  When I pointed out an issue with some work I found 2 weeks later, Cory had it fixed the same day I brought the car back.  When my teenager had an accident, I sent her to see Cory.  When my elderly father needed some body work from a parking lot hit-and-run we took his car there and Cory buffed the whole car for no additional charge.
5	Came in to get my car hood latch repaired after going to 2 other auto body companies. Very great experience from quote to repair. Would recommend to anyone!
5	Took my car there for a quote, Cory was friendly and straight forward. I felt comfortable there, 3 days later I brought my car in and they worked on it and got it back to working order.Cory asked what he quoted me and said they were able to do it with in house parts so it would be LESS money...HONESTY AND INTEGRITY... Cory, you have a customer for life.All people want from a mechanic is honesty and a fair price with quality workmanship... you deliver that in spades.Thank you,Michael Schilling
