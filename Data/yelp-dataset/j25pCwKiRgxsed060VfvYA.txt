4	This is a great little shop with everything from kiddie tricks to collectibles. I think it's owned by the same guy that owns the large magic booths at the Fantastik Swap Meet. It looks pretty new; the main room is open for business even though there is construction going on in the back room. I asked what it was and the guy at the counter hinted at a small theater "magically appearing"- sounds good to me! Will definitely be back.
4	This location is open by appointment only, the same owner also has a shop at the great indoor swapmeet which is great but was a small selection.
5	Super cool hidden gem for the magic world. Big open space for events and great staff.
5	This place was a great find. I came to buy a birthday present for my friends son. They have so many cool things i didnt even know what to get. I will come back for possibly a gift for myself too.
