4	Had to get a rental through my insurance due to an accident and these guys did a great job. It was busy when I first arrived but they were quick to get to me and had a few cars for me to choose from. They gave me two choices initially which I didn't really want but then he found a car I wanted and got me all set up.
5	Great customer service! If you need a car for for whatever reason this is the place. They have compacts up to the exotics and everything in between.  They are very speedy and do everything they can to accommodate you. Expect nothing but top notch service when you come here.
5	Best car rental experience EVER!  First, it has GREAT hours in comparison with the other car rental locations (excluding the 24 hour airport), consistently super nice staff, low wait times, great price (online) and I drove the cutest little Fiat.  They are also right beside my house - which doesn't hurt!  (side note: I found a cheaper rate online compared to what they quoted me over the phone, but I think that is pretty typical for rental companies....). I will definitely be back next time I need a rental car.  :)  Thanks!
4	This location was a hot mess when I initially rented and returned my car,  (wrong pricing, uninformed staff, mediocre management) it was a disgrace to Enterprises everywhere. I am glad I granted this location a second chance months later. They were on the ball! Professional, present, informative, and extremely helpful. Thumbs up! Thanks for restoring my faith in Enterprise and this location!!!!
