4	The massage therapist, Susan, is one of those rare finds in a chiropractic clinic. She is an experienced and talented massage therapist whom I highly recommend.
5	I highly recommend the massage. Susan was professional, thorough and I benefited greatly from my massages.  One of the best massage experiences I've ever had!    Will definitely return!
5	After my car accident I was in so much pain that I needed someone that could help me fast. I was able to schedule my appointment the same day and after my first adjustment I started to feel so much better. Dr. Tom took his time and was able to help me. I was so impressed that my wife, 16 year old daughter and 15 year old son came to him on a regular basis. My kids are very active in sports and they alway use to complain about aching bone pain. NOT ANY MORE. Thanks Dr. Tom.
5	Active Life Center was recommended to me by a friend who also works in the medical field when I complained of chronic back pain that I had been experiencing for several months.  Tom was super friendly and welcoming to help me out and fortunately had an x-ray machine because it helped him diagnose my condition.  After a couple of months of weekly visits and instructed exercises that I could do on my own at home, I felt much better and even bought some of the same equipment that they use in the office for my home.I'm very happy I met Tom and his team at Active Life Center.  Without a doubt, I would send my friends and family to Tom and his team.Thanks Tom!
