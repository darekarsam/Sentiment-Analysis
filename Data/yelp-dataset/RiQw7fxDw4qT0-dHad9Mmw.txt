4	I live right around the corner from Thali, so I like to get my food to go (also because it's not the most appealing place to eat..). I really like their samosas, and I always get the meal with 2 meat dishes and one veggie dish. Everything I've had has been really good-- the butter chicken and anything with eggplant are reliably great choices.
