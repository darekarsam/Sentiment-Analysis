5	This is a great store! If you are wanting to add some decorative touches to your room, want to coordinate an upholster chair with your curtains, or bedspread, frame that great picture, or just create a floral arrangement, this place has it all.If you sew, quilt, knit, crochet, paint or bead this is the place to shop. So many choices and decent prices as well.  Check on line for adds and store coupons, better yet sign up and they'll email them weekly. This place is also good for the hobbyist,  with model trains, landscapes, model paints, even miniature items like room sets and lighting kits. The location is great for me, just minutes away, and it's even closer than any other craft store, so it's perfect, those craft enthusiast's on the West side know this to be true.
4	I like this store- it's got a little of many things, and the employees seem friendly. I had to get a few odd school supplies for my son and was pleased I could find them here much more affordably than online. Some of the items are TJ Maxx-ish (metal candle lanterns, wall hangings) but I guess they can fit into the crafter's repertoire. It was crowded tonight (Monday) due to the holidays.
1	Slowest fucking check out every. Single. Time. Brain dead ass cashiers in lala land. The only thing this place had going for them is the 50% off sales they have on certain items everyday because it's over priced as shit.
5	This place was awesome. I expected a super small place but this place was huge.  They have so much fabric which is awesome!
