5	We have had the privilege of working with Dave Johnson on several occasions I can say with all honesty that his stage presence his personality and his professionalism is incredible I also know that his dedication to his craft and his work ethic to deliver a great show is unmatched I would highly recommend him and I thank him for all that He has done for us.

5	There are many performers that are great magicians but few magicians that are great performers. Dave Johnson combines personality, humor and the ability to make a great first impression with his magic. I've seen him perform once and that's all it took to see the top notch professionalism he represents.
5	I have an Emmy winning friend from Hollywood that needed a good magician for his family event here in Vegas.  Dave was the perfect recommendation.  His entertainment is perfect for a wide range of ages.  He is always professional and timely.  His act is polished.  Dave is a gentleman and a master wizard.  Great work Dave!
5	Dave is the best of the best. He performed for our group of Defense Department employees at a recent conference, and faced a tough crowd. Tough or not, he immediately put them at east and had them all on the edge of their seats and laughing in no time.  Everyone agreed Dave was the absolute high point of the week-long meeting. I've since seen Dave perform several times for both large and small groups, and he always brings his A game, along with a TON of experience. I highly recommend you let Dave work his magic for you and your event.
