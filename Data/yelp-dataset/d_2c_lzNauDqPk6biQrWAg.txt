5	Best Property Management company in Las Vegas! I have delt with a number of Property Management Companies for many years. COR Property Management team has been our management company for the past 4 years and have done an outstanding job for our community. They have saved us thousands of dollars and have provided us management service way beyond any other company that we have worked with. The staff at COR Property Management is allways a pleasure to work with and I would recommend this company to anyone looking for an honest and professional property management company in Las Vegas.
5	As a seasoned real estate investor I thaught I would try to find my own residential income properties in Las Vegas... Wow, what a mistake! After I found COR Real Estate Las Vegas I found 3 properties in the first week and was able to close in under a month. COR handled every aspect of the deal and over-saw the preparation for rental and then tookover every aspect of the Property Management.  I can only hope that COR will soon open franchises in Miami and New York.  I am very happy customer  As a seasoned real estate investor I thaught I would try to find my own residential income properties in Las Vegas... Wow, what a mistake!

5	Moneque did a tremendous job in locating me the perfect unit in Boulder. She helped me refine my search by looking at different options. She even suggested outside of Boulder which was helpful in me making my decision. I now sit in a great unit. It is 2 bedrooms and I am able to use the large bedroom as my office and take it out of the living room. I recommend Housing Helpers and Moneque for your housing needs.
