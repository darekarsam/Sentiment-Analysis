1	I just called to try and ask a few questions before ordering. Because their menu is so strange, I felt like I ought to see what the employees thought was the best specialty pizza. Seriously, all I wanted was to give them a chance. The guy was SO RUDE I honestly couldn't believe it. Aren't they trying to open a small business? That isn't the attitude to make it work. The guy asked if I hadn't ever eaten a pizza before. Then I said I hadn't had a "Korean pizza" and he responded by saying that their menu was the same as one world. First of all, that is a blatant lie. Second of all, even if it were true, that's not how you should present your business to your customers. Whatever. I've never tried it and now I never will.
4	I'm not sure who the previous reviewers were dealing with, but my experience with Drew's Pizzeria was much more pleasant. I found the deal for a large speciality pizza for $9.99 online at eatcu.com, and proceeded to call them and order a large Thai Chicken pizza. What was slightly disappointing was that they accidentally made a Taj Mahal (pizza with tikka sauce and tandoori chicken) and I had to wait an additional 10 minutes. My disappointment quickly went away when I saw them bring out 2 pizza boxes to me, giving me both the Thai Chicken and Taj Mahal pizza (for free).  The pizza itself was slightly dry, but overall delicious. The Taj Mahal was actually my favorite but the Thai Chicken was good as well. I'm glad for the mix up since I was able to get a taste of 2 speciality pizzas. I'd recommend trying their pizza out, especially while the $9.99 special lasts.
4	With Gumby's closed it was hard to find good pizza in the CU area. Drew's definitely fills the Gumby gap. It reminds me of my favorite place in Chicago, Piece. The pizza is extra cheesy, and the crust actually tastes like it was made -- not picked up out of cardboard box in the back of a warehouse freezer. Drew's is definitely my go to from now on.
5	I thought Drew's was awesome. Crust is obviously made fresh. Lots of cheese and sauce and priced right too, basically perfect pizza.
4	This is a weird place. Bright white walls, no decor. Kind of sketchy looking. But...Surprisingly good pizza! Late night special $5 (cash) will get ya a cheese, sausage, or pepperoni pie. Good and crispy, yum!Super quick transactions - give 'em a five spot, get a pizza. And in case the bars close and you didn't know you wanted a $5 pizza, you might be lucky enough to hear someone from Drew's yelling in the street. That's brilliant business right there. Overall good experiences here, but I still think it's creepy. Creepy, but delicious.
1	This place is AWFUL!  It took them 116 minutes to deliver a pizza 8 blocks away from the store.  No apologies, no excuses, no phone call.  I will never order from them again.  In fact, when the driver finally arrived, he slammed the pizza at the base of the door and walked away.  Worst service ever.
1	Do not order pizza here. It took them more than 2 hours to deliver a pizza. No apologies, no phone calls. My house is only 5 minutes away from the store!
5	I thought Drews was great. Its best if you order online because they get the order faster. I ordered cause  they had a deal on cieats and I couldn't have been happier. Hot and cheesy goodness in 20 minutes at my door. It's basically Pappa Johns prices but much much better quality. I'll be ordering from Drews from now on
5	The 1-star reviews are solely complaining about delivery.  I ate in here on a Saturday night, and I had a great experience--needless to say, just visit after a night at the bars and don't order delivery if they're slow.I came here after a night on the town and got $5 medium pizzas (Feta, Sausage), and both were terrific.  Much better than the previous owners (One World).  Turns outDrew's sold their recipe to One Worlds back in 2000, but then One World changed the recipe and made sh!t pizzas.Drew's is much better.  Crispy crust, soft insides, and delicious toppings--all for the Saturday night special of $5 for a medium pizza.  Definitely worth a stop by--I would have given 4 stars but they need some 5 stars reviews to bring the rating of the pizza joint up.  It is definitely a solid joint and I would visit again if I was still on campus.
1	Free pizza for girls who flash the cashier?  This place is a shit-show.   No thanks.
1	Sexist place gives free pizza to drunk girls who flash the employees: http://www.dailyillini.com/opinion/columns/article_24fa819a-1e8f-11e3-a112-001a4bcf6878.htmland the pizza isn't great
3	Is Drew's sleazy? Oh, most definitely. The place looks like it's one step above selling pizzas out of the back of a van and it did not shock me in the very least that they were offering food for boobs: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/drews-pizza-free-pies-women-who-flash_n_3913473.htmlBut Drew's is cheap and delicious, especially after a late night at Murphys or one of the other campus bars. The pepperoni is priced at Little Caesar's levels and tastes like... well, pretty good pizza. I'll do barcrawls in Campustown with friends during the summer, and this is always a nice place to stop for some grease to prevent hangovers.
