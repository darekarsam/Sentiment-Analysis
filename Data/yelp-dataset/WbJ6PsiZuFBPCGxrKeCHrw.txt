4	Charlie is a really nice guy, I am a chef in training at a school in Montreal and I had report due, I stopped off at his shop and talked about cooking and more specifically the innovation of cooking for health. He has a variety of baked goods for diabetics and also gluten-free options. It is lab as well as a great place to try new items, along the lines of a `El Bulli` cafe!
5	Fantastic texture in their loaf bread. So hard to get that light, airy gluten free bread but they nailed it. And wonderful toasted, too!
5	Wow this is good, no this is great! They've managed to create satisfying baked goods that have really nice textures and flavors while being Gluten Free. We tried it in person and enjoyed it so much we ordered some online when we got home. That too was/is delicious. The order arrived within a few days (internationally no less!) and the breads and bagel really are awesome even when going from the freezer or frig to the oven. Best GF croissants ever and the bagel are wonderful!When we travel we always keep a look out for GF bakeries and try them, and during a recent trip to Montreal we were fortunate to find this Gluten Free bakery which surpasses nearly everything else we have ever tried and rivals our international favorite (Mariposa) in San Francisco.
