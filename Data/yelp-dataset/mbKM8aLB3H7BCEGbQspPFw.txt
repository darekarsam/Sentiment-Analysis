5	I try to go here for lunch at least once a week. I believe it is the best lunch spot in the strip if not Pittsburgh. It's so good that it actually makes me smile thinking about it. I get the smoked salmon salad or the spicy thai wrap. I keep telling myself to branch out but they're such perfect lunches. Their cookies are delicious too. And the lady at the cash register is really nice! Absolute A+
5	Yum!  What a great place to stop and grab lunch in the Strip District.  I live in Denver now, but spend 8 - 10 weeks a year in Pittsburgh.  My office is right around the corner from this place.  And in a neighborhood that was not long ago in desperate need of some good lunch options, this place fits the bill perfectly.Each time I'm in the office, and wondering what's for lunch, this is usually first on my list.  I really like that you can go to their Facebook page and check out the specials for the day.  That way I can make up my mind before I get there as it's not a very big space.  I LOVE the smoked salmon salad - though I wish the dressing was a bit different.  I think the honey throws it off and would rather see a more traditional lemon vinaigrette.  But, that's just my taste.If you haven't tried this place for lunch, and spend any time during the week in the Strip, you have to try this place!
5	We had our reception at The Pennsylvanian in Pittsburgh. Opening Night Caterers was our first choice and we were not disappointed!! From the first meeting, to the wonderful tasting, to the preparation and set up, to the big day, we could not have been more pleased with the service or the food. Everyone raved about it being the best wedding food ever! And the cake!! Delicious and beautiful. I would highly recommend to anyone!
