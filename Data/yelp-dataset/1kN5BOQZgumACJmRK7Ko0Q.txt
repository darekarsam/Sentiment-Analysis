1	We have been living in Henderson for years but seldom need to use a taxi service. Tonight my husband and I wanted to go to dinner and not worry about a DD so we called Deluxe Taxicab Service. We have used them before to get to the airport which was routine but tonight we had a terrible experience with their dispatcher. We called and we were told we could get a cab in 20 min. When we tried to tell the dispatcher that we wanted to reserve a car for a later time, he curtly responded...call back when you are ready. That response made no sense if the soonest we could get at cab at this moment was in 20 min, who was to say what the time gap would be..."when we were ready?" that may have caused is to miss our reservation. After canceling the the car all together we noticed on their website a statement that reads "we know our dispatchers are mean". Well what they don't seem to know is that they are NOT the only taxi services in Henderson. We called Desert Cab and they reserved our taxi as requested while also being kind and considerate.We have since deleted Deluxe from our contacts.
1	Worst service ever!! dispatchers are rude and cabs have a tendency to "no show"
1	This is the worst Cab Service ever !!! Operators are extremely rude and don't care about your business at all.We are the business in Henderson and have used them before. I asked for a cab for our guests and he asked me where do you want to be dropped off and I told him that Sunset and Green Valley ( that's what our customer told us ). He got upset and basically yelled at me we don't pick up corners so, tell me where do you want to be dropped off. After confirming the guests, I told him the Marriott Hotel (exact location) and then he asked me again where do you want to be dropped off and I said I just told you Marriott and he was like so you are at Sunset and green valley and needs to be dropped off at Marriott. And I was like no did I tell you that and he basically got upset and started asking me sarcastically and I told him that there is no need to be rude and I don't want your service any more. We are the business too and we know how tough the economy is right now. But, I guess he doesn't seems to care. They were number one on our list and I just crossed off their name and advised everyone to not to call them anymore. They should get their thing together else it would be hard for them to survive as there are so many other companies ready to grab on whatever comes. Just Saying !!!!!
1	****update*****Although I still stand by the fact that the majority of the drivers are great, we will no longer be using deluxe and strongly advise people do the same.While balancing my account with my online banking I noticed a charge from Deluxe on a day we did not use their services. In fact, we hadn't used them for several days, and the charge from the day we did was on there too so it wasn't an instance of it just not showing up. Sure enough I called our bank and they showed the charge as not being swiped or entered in, Deluxe just simply double charged our previous ride DAYS after the fact. How that's even possible I don't know, but I digress.My husband called and spoke to a manager, whose answer was that he would get back to him. Never happened. My husband called back again and the rudest employee of any business forever answered, said " I'm the only one here so what do you want?" When my husband explained it to him and told him we would never use their service again, the guy said ok and hung up. Who does that?! Very strongly considering filing a complaint with the BBB. ***orig. review***I am torn. My husband and I use Deluxe out of necessity several times a week for over a year now, and while I don't usually write negative reviews, I feel the need to today.If this review was solely for the drivers, it would be an easy 4-5 stars, as most of them are great! In fact I've only had one really, really bad one and only have gotten her twice (this person shouldn't be driving ANYTHING let alone a taxi for a living, but that's a separate topic.) I am always grateful when drivers give me their personal cards so that I can just give them my business and be done with it.That being said, if this review was solely based on the company itself, management, and the dispatchers, then 1 star would be too much. This company is horrible and apparently not one person who works the dispatch has ever been properly trained in customer service. Half of them won't let you order a cab, half will. All of them talk down to you. I've waited 45 mins + too many times and have had the drivers tell me they JUST got the call and came right over. I've had dispatch send them to the wrong addresses, and they're never apologetic. Never the less, we really do like the drivers, so we will continue to use their service for that reason alone. After all, they're just victims of poor management. :)
1	I called this company asking for help as I moved to Vegas 3 days ago and they said $15  to go a mile and a half. WOW
1	From start to finish, the driver acted towards us like we are some kind of terrorists and she's the riot police.  She made sure to intimidate us with phrases such as "you are in Vegas now, here you better be nice to me", "if I deny your trip, so will all the others", "if you say a bad word here, it's an assault and you will be thrown to jail".  When I simply asked her for her taxicab number, she promptly pulled over to the side of the street, and said "you are getting off HERE.  And you will pay up, or I will call the cops".Who are we to deserve this attitude?  I am sorry to say, but that's not how you get businesses.
1	We visited Henderson and tried to get a cab to the strip.. Our hotel called this company for us.. After 30 minutes, we inquired about our car so they gave us the number to call. We called Deluxe 4 or 5 times to have them pick up and hang up the phone. We called once more and they just let it ring... And let it ring. Luckily Star Cab showed up by chance and saved the day. Deluxe is the least dependable cab company on the planet.
3	I agreed with the above reviews about all the dispatchers until tonight! The day shift dispatchers are horrible! Haven't had a friendly one yet and the drivers complain about how bad there own dispatchers are, but tonight (Sunday around 8pm) I actually called them in the evening for a change and the guy that answered was polite and even funny on the phone but with deluxe's track record they'll probably run him right out the door and we will be stuck with another rude hates life dispatcher!
1	Excerpt from their website: "Henderson, South Las Vegas and Boulder Citys' Number One Taxicab Company!"I THINK NOT.Let alone from all the noticeable grammatical mistakes on their website (which disturbs me for a business' standpoint) this is not a reputable business. We contacted this service for an elderly couple and have been given an ETA of thirty (30) to forty (40) minutes. After a fairly long wait we contacted them once again to verify that a cab unit had been dispatched. When we explained that we had called previously and it had been past forty-five (45) minutes we received a blunt/rude reply of "Yeah, they'll be there in fifteen (15) minutes. *CLICK*" and hung up. Clearly from previous reviews, yes, the dispatchers are rude. This time the cab finally arrived around the second ETA and we helped the elderly couple out to the cab. The initial interaction with the driver was a head turn to see the three of us opening the door and then returning to his clipboard to finish documenting some things - absolutely no greeting, no words, NOTHING - just sat there writing to turning his attention to his phone. After getting the couple into the car and closing the door I kept a close eye on the employee seeing if he made ANY interaction with the passengers and I saw nothing while he drove off.I reviewed their website and again I will take note of the small grammatical errors and such. I even Googled their supposed HQ and/or dispatch location and it was only approximately 10-15 minutes BUT the wait was already nearly an hour this first time! Not acceptable.Everyone needs to take one more note that this business is NOT BBB accredited!Please do not use this cab service if you want to keep your sanity.Thanks for reading.
