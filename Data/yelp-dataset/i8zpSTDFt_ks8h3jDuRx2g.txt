2	Found Very Terry Contemporary Consignments over in Dilworth. Not much going on in here, a lack of great designer pieces and a small selection of handbags and jewelry. I did see a lot of items from Chico's, which I'm not into. If you are younger and looking for some great consignment pieces, head a few doors down to "Sweet Repeats".
4	This is very upper class for a consignment store.  I mean it, there is really a lot going on here.  There is a designer stuff, and tons of other cool finds.  But the real cool thing about this place is the owner herself.  Terry is very committed to running the best business she can.  She's very choosy about the clothes she puts out and will even help you coordinate your outfit, if she see something you'd look good in.  Overall, this is a very cute shop with a lot of spirit.
1	I was visiting Charlotte late-July & love to shop 'out of town' so when I come back home, I have unique items.My friend & I drove out on a Monday & the shop was closed. No problem, some small shops are so we checked the store hours & drove out again on Tues. We  found 'Sweet Repeats' in the next door building open Tues so now we can see both shops. Yeah for us.Arrived Tuesday afternoon to find Very Terry had now changed her 'Summer Hours' to Wed-Sat. What????Oh well, shopped more @ Sweet Repeats.  We were NOT driving out for a 3rd day in a row.
3	Some good deals. Some things over priced. $200 dresses. Not a huge selection. Terry the owner was super nice. Local business that has been around for over 20 years so gotta support that.
