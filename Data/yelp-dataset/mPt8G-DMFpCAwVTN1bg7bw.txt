5	After our car broke down well outside of Phoenix, we were struggling to find a place that could help us out.  We called at least 4 other places that either: didn't answer the phone, were closed on mondays, or were on vacation.  Finally we found Calvert's and had our car towed there.They were THE nicest repair shop I've ever been to.  They realized that we were on the road and worked as fast as possible to figure out the problem and get us back on the road.They managed to get us back on the road around noon the next day, and everything was well explained and VERY fairly-priced.  If you break down in the desert, you couldn't wish for a better place to help you get back on track to your destination. A MILLION THANKS!They even offered us a ride to a motel (we got a ride from someone else which is a whole other story), and picked us up from the motel to get our car.These guys were the absolute definition of what you would want a car repair shop to be!Thanks again!!!!!!
5	I trust them with my various cars and have for decades. You will always get the straight scoop and great work from David, Ray Ron and Wayne.Kevin J.
5	i have heard from different people that this is the place to go for all your car troubles!! when its time for me this is where i will take my car
5	We are always looking for an Honest guy to work on our cars but Calvert's has so much more, cleanest carwash in the state, cleanest bath rooms I have ever seen at a gas station, like those super gulps for a buck.  Thanks Dave
5	I usually always buy my gas here and the price is always reasonable. I've even had my car serviced here a few times and David always makes sure its right!! Also very nice car wash attached to the gas station that works very well!
