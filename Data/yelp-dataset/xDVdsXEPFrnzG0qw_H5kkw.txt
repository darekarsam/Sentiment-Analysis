5	Dr. Maffi, along with his aestheticians, nurses and support staff, is the very best of the best.  He gives his patients as much time as they could possibly need and/or want; answers your questions thoughtfully and thoroughly, and is always available for that "one thing" you forgot to ask. His work is subtle, precise, and skillful. I use him and his entire range of services and wouldn't even think if going elsewhere. Strangers often stop me to ask about my skin, because they take care of it so well. I have recommended Dr. Maffi along with his staff for skin care, injectables, and treatments, and everyone has been thrilled. They are quite simply: the best.
5	There are TONS of Plastic Surgeons in Scottsdale!NEVER met with another after consultation with Dr. Maffi and his staff. Wonderful, warm, caring, professional, responsive, great communication, realistic AND stand by their work and EVERYTHING they say and do.I promise you will not be disappointed...
