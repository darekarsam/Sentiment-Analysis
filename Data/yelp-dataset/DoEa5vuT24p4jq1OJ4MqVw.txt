5	This is as good as it gets; I have never been to a hospital where I have received better care by more caring, compassionate and competent people.  I was truly floored.  I walked in prepared to wait a long time and was taken immediately, then attended to by not one, but two nurses, followed by the attending dr who was concerned and thorough.  I was never even asked about insurance or payment until AFTER my tests were completed and I was waiting the results.  I was given follow up drs to contact given I was new to the area, a disc that held all the information regarding the tests I had been given.  I hope no one needs to utilize this service, but in the event that you do, please do not hesitate to use this urgent care.  You will be well cared for not only physically, but with empathy and compassion.  God bless all of you who I came in contact with today.
4	Efficient and speedy. When it's a weekend and you don't feel like waiting until Monday to try and make an appointment to see your primary care physician, Urgent Care fills a niche.Coughing and wheezing and sniffling my way in, the clerk at the desk took my details and had me fill out a form. When I returned, she took my copay while I waited to see the doctor. About 20 minutes later, into the small room where I waited another few minutes before the doctor came in. He gave me a thorough exam and determined that I had a chest and nasal infection. A prescription later and a recommendation for bed rest (uh, no. travel instead), I was out the door.Would I return? Absolutely. Good stuff!
