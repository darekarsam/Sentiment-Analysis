5	Love these girls, Jennifer is awesome! Everyone is super friendly & helpful! I have never had a problem with anything and I wouldn't bank anywhere else!
1	This branch is allegedly part of the CU$ alliance which allows credit union members nationwide to withdrawal from an alliance ATM, surcharge free. I'm a member of a sister credit union and the ATM said it would impose a $2.50 fee. I cancelled my transaction and left. If you don't bank with SunWest FCU directly, stay away from their ATM's!!!
5	I cannot say enough great things about this organization and the people who work there. Sandy is particularly awesome and went above and beyond to help us get our auto refinance completed, even while their computers were down. Her excellent customer service is top notch and all the other girls are wonderful too. They really care about their members and when it comes to things like loans, they don't just judge you by a credit score, but look at the whole picture. Most banking and financial institutions are not like that, they look at your score and if it is not exactly where it should be, they instantly deny you. I am thankful for this credit union and the people behind it, who care and treat each individual as just that, an individual, not a number. I highly recommend this credit union to everyone!
