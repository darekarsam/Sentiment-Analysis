5	Friendly staff and beautiful salon! The pedicures are absolutely amazing' your feet will feel so wonderful and soft when you leave here!
5	Best Salon in Carnegie!  Antinas is my go to spot for gift certificates for my family.  I but them for my Mom every Christmas. Tina does a great job and it always feels like a family visit when you're in there.  The renovations are amazing and you kind of forget you're in Carnegie for an hour as you are transported to a fancy big city salon.  That said, everybody is always super nice when you're there.
2	5 stars for cuteness of the place. Home-like feel. Nice people. Good experience. I was planning on returning here...before I saw the results one day later.Hugely negative points for the mani/pedi polish chipping off in big chunks in less than 24 hours after application. What's the point of spending all that money if the color will only last less than one day? Perhaps it is the "alcohol drops" they applied to enable quicker drying - or maybe it's the quality of their polish. In either case, it was very disappointing to have driven half an hour to their location and spend good money only to have large pieces of paint fall right off of your nails within a day.
