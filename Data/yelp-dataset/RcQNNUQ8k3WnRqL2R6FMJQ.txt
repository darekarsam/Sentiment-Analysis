5	Spirit is in the house ~ this little spiritual center is one of the best kept secrets in town.  Currently the Center is without a formal pastor ~ but that could be the best thing that ever happened.  The community of people who attend and support the center are some of the nicest, most sincere people you will ever meet and have really rallied to work together to maintain a loving center.  Currently they have a variety of powerful Guest Speakers and Pastors providing the Sunday message.The facilty itself is charming and very inviting . . .however it is the people who make the experience delightful and full-filling.  IF you are looking for a Spiritual experience, not a religious experience, stop by on Sunday morning for their 10 am service.. You will be welcomed . . and leave filled. Plus they have great personal development classes throughout the week and weekend with an emphasis on postive prosperity and personal purpose and empowerment.It's a place of blessing . . .blessings to them as they rebuild and grow.  : ) KC
