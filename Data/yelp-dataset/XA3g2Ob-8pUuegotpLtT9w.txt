5	I love Elements. The staff is awesome and very helpful.
5	Fantastic all-women gym in Uptown.  Great staff, excellent classes and all the equipment you need in a small, private gym.   The monthly dues are extremely affordable too in comparision to other gyms.  I only wish I could get there more often!
4	Elements is a women only gym in the heart of Uptown. Its small but the staff is friendly and accommodating. They have state of the art circuit equipment and have added way more classes during the day. One of my faves: pilates with Jennifer. She is so nice and gives you a heck of a workout. They also offer zumba, yoga and other classes. In addition you can get personal training sessions and they have "pamper me" days where Zen Massage will come in to conduct massages. Nice!

4	Effective as of Monday, August 29th Elements for Women is permanently closed. The owner thanked everyone in an email (this must have been sent to members and those on the email list) and went on to say that he "was forced to make a hard decision that ultimately was better for me and my kids". I can completely understand. This was a great gym and I am sad to see that it is now closed.
