5	I'm so glad I found Lesli! It's hard to find someone really good to do your hair in Vegas so when I found Lesli I was so relieved. She really cares about her clients and wants them to look good. I like how she pays attention to details and wants you to leave happy- definitely recommend !
5	I found Leslie when I first came to Vegas & had to have her "fix" my hair color from another hair salon. Leslie is amazing!!! So friendly & fun, makes you feel like you've known her for years. Her work is absolutely the best. I highly recommend her.
5	Lesli is not only an amazing,  talented and precise hairdresser,  she is also a genuine, caring person! When you find a person like her who is good and takes so much pride in their job and is a bona-fide good person, you keep coming back. Thank you Lesli!
5	I have been a client of Leslie for almost 3 years now. She is truly the best stylist I've ever had. She takes her time and pays attention to every detail. Since I have curly hair my hair is hard to cut and her patience and attention to doing it right makes her the best in my book.
