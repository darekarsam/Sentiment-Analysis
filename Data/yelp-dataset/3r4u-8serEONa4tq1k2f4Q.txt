4	Who knew - a costume store all year round... Halloween 365 - that's my kind of party...Supplies from napkins to balloons... Costumes from A to Make-up to Zombie... Even candy at the checkout counter for your inner child...Handy dandy staff will go in back to find all the parts to your costume - even if it's the last one.... Unfortunately, I didn't see the cost of the party itself - I doubt there's any of those on sale.
