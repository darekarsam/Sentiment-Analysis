3	This places used to be my local off-licence. It was overpriced and fairly poorly stocked, but it was really really close. Then the company who owned it went up and the place was empty for what seemed like months and months.Then this place sprung up, and what a difference! First of all, and I don't know if this was strategic or not (it would be cynical of me to think so, so I obviously think it was), there was a van parked outside which said something like 'purveyors of fine wines' in some fancy italics. Good start.But then inside it was a different story. Sure, some fine wines were on display. But not many. There was nothing in there. I know it's just opened, but surely you'd get the place kitted out before you open the doors? Only time will tell if this place takes off. At the moment I'm undecided.
