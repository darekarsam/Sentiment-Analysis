4	If you are looking for a more "classic" Yoga kind of style, Sivananda Yoga is the place to be. Probably the oldest Yoga place in Montreal, you can either "jump" in a class or register for a number of classes. Which is very cool, especially if you have a busy urban schedule! Each class, you have a different teacher. So if you don't like the teaching style of someone, you are not stuck with him/her for the next 10 lessons. It last about an hour and a half. The first 30 mintures are usually some small yoga-related exercices such as breathing and relaxation. Then, you go on practicing. And, during the last 15 minutes, you have the relaxation part. You can bring your own Yoga mat, or they will offer one to you if you don't have one. In the room that I was, there also was a small shrine which included images of important leaders of most of the different religions of the world. Which I thought was very respectful considering that everyone has different beliefs. A very nice place to practice Yoga. It's about 10 minutes a walk from Metro Laurier, and well worth it!
