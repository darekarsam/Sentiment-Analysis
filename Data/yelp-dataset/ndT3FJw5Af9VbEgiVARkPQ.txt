5	We had an emergency plumbing situation today when our shower got backed up and sewage started backwashing into the shower. Gross!  We went through our home warranty company and they contracted to Do it Right Plumbing and we're glad they did. We received a call back within an hour from the company and they dispatched a technician out asap.  Ken was very helpful, knowledgeable and immediately diagnosed that the problem was not on the line going to the street but rather the main line to the house.  He fed the motorized snake in and got the clog out at almost 40ft!  Ken suggested we test all showers, faucets and toilets to make sure they were all draining properly and we are happy to say he fixed the issue!  The cleanup was no fun but the fact that Do it RIght came out asap and got the problem fixed the same day was fantastic.  I recommend this company for anyone that needs quality and fast plumbing services.
1	I had a very similar situation happen to me this week. My warranty company assigned them to an issue I had with a leak in my bathtub. The technicians were okay minus calling in sick and forcing us to reschedule several times. The major issue I had with them was their office staff. They were very rude and inappropriate. Ruby referred to one of their clients who was causing my appointment to be delayed as not mentally stable. Then, she asked me to describe the plumbers by race. This company is terrible and I would not recommend them to anyone. I will call my warranty company to request that they remove them as a service provider as well.
