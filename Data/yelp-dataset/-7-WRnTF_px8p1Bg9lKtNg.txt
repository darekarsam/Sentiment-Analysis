5	Glad that I found a Hobby Shop located in Chandler! Employees there that I have encountered have been very helpful and always answers all my questions! I recommend them!
4	I was just driving thru the parking lot and I saw the word HOBBY so I had to stop in and see what they had.  It is a store geared to model building and they have all kinds of supplies related to that, parts and pieces, tools and paints, kits and accessories, you name it.  If you build models it is worth going to see this store.  The employee was very nice, too.
2	Went here looking for some aorta for my JATO... Walked in and got ignored by the girl in the front and the guy behind the counter, so my son and I searched on our own. I didn't see anything so I saw some tires and rims and I was told it wouldn't fit my rc (different guy). So I asked about some shocks and when they handed them to me I was shocked they were 75.00.   I asked why they were so much and the guy behind the counter asked if I would like to pay retail... I said I thought it was retail considering I've seen them for about 57 everywhere else. He promptly told me it was because there's came with springs! When I showed him they didn't come with springs he simply said oh well that's the price.  I quickly left and orderd them online... This place is a ripoff. One person was helpful hence the 2 stars as opposed to the one star they deserve. Go anywhere else I'm sure you will find better pricing.
5	Finally a hobby shop in Chandler that I can go to. Purchase a Slash 4x4. Couldnt beat the price. Love that I can go in there to get parts I need and work on my truck there. Any questions I have the owner is there to answer them. I recommend this hobby shop!
