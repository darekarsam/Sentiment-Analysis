4	Limited hours so check before you go!  I posted a photo of their hours sign as of 9-1-11.  Friendly staff!  Some cool lighting and a few pieces of furniture.
5	Best furniture in Charlotte if you're looking for unique non-standard pieces.  Wes is great and their prices generally match or beat Hickory.
5	Love this place...have been a fan since Rodney was on Hwy 16...AMAZING...The great thing is that most of their things you can purchase and take home with you that day.  Talk about instant gratification.
