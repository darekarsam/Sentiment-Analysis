4	A lovely patisserie/boulangerie/traiteur/salon de the in Laval near my grandmother's. Not a replacement for her baking, but they make some great treats to grab and go, whether a sandwich, quiche, cake or anything else in between.They have tables to sit at there if you want to pamper yourself, relax and catch up with an old friend for example. It's within a small shopping area (Jean Coutu and Videotron in the same area so hard to miss) so there should be no trouble to find parking.I've only been there on weekdays in the afternoon - no idea how busy it gets in the morning or on weekends (if I had to guess, they get much more traffic then).
5	We were recently in Paris, and I have to say that the croissants there don't hold a candle to the ones here. You can't just have one. They are exceptionally flaky, buttery and delicious. Especially the pate d'amemdes!
