1	Scott the owner has done two projects for me. On both projects Scott quoted one price and then charged me a different price. Both times the price charged was almost double the original quote.  Scott does good work but can not meet deadlines he set. When pushed to meet the deadlines his work gets rushed and very poor quality.  Don't use this guy you'll be sorry
