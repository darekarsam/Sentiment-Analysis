4	Dr. Tolson is awesome! My entire office uses him as our general practitioner. I highly recommend him to anyone. His staff is excellent. They always make sure you understand everything and are great about calling back asap with test results. I have full trust in him as my doctor.
5	I see Dr. Anderson as my primary care physician. He's an incredibly empathetic and professional doctor. He always takes the time to listen to my concerns and answer my questions. The rest of the staff is wonderful too. Even though I live in Maricopa now, I refuse to find a closer primary. A doctor like this is rare in this day of get-em-in-get-em-out practices.
5	Yep, a doctors office that gets four stars.  I go to Doctor Underhill.What great "bedside manner".  He was able to VERY tactfully tell me that I'm fat and drink and eat to much.  I think there will be more salad reviews in my future.Seriously though, all the new patient forms are available on line so you can fill them out before you go.  They are on time and even open for walk-ins on the weekend and you don't have to go off site to have your blood drawn.Good folks.
4	I have been going to this practice about a year and really like Dr. Tolson. My family also sees him and agrees. He takes the time to listen to you and doesn't make you feel rushed. The office staff is just ok,  but I don't go there to see them so it really doesn't matter that much to me. They seem to be able to get you in quickly if you are having a problem.They also do blood work there.
2	The Doctors and nurses here are second to none.The front staff staff however are awful.They are more concerned with collecting money than they are with patients.If you call in or deal with them in person -they are rude and unprofessional.Dont be surprised if you end up in the waiting room for a while because of their incompetence.
4	Very customer focused, not a long wait. Great docs too!
