3	I had a good experience with Dr. Eric Seitlin at this practice. I called and they fit me in for a check-up the next day. The dental hygienist was nice and did a thorough job with the cleaning and X-rays. Then Dr. Seitlin came in to examine my teeth and X-rays. He was very friendly and showed me my X-rays, teaching me what the different elements of the X-ray meant. It was the first time a dentist had taken the time to explain things to me.
5	What a great dental experience (is that a thing? can it be a thing?).  Full disclosure:  I had not been to the dentist in about 5 years before I came to Dr. Neidan.  It was a mess in there.  But he handled it so very well, and wasn't mean or condescending in any way.  7 cavities and 2 sessions later, I'm good as new.  The hygenists there are all fantastic, and they have a GREAT online system for filling out information that is quick and easy.  You can email their billing department and ask for an estimate of your dental work so that you are prepared with payment when you come in, which is awesome.  AND.... he doesn't try to talk to you when you have crap in your mouth.  That's worth it's weight in gold (teeth).
5	My open bite, cross bite, diasthma, and spacing didn't prove to be too much for Dr. Eric Seitlin and Invisalign to handle. My smile was corrected in just over a year. Along with my teeth, the structure of my face and confidence have changed for the better. His staff is amazing and I always look forward to my visits. Schedule your visit, begin treatment, and watch the compliments ROLL IN! They come highly recommended.
