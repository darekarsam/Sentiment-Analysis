4	It's so nice to go to a gym and not have to be on a waiting list for a treadmill or elliptical. This place is very clean, everyone here is friendly, and you don't seem to get the normal stare downs you do at most other gyms. If you do join, definitely take advantage of the complimentary training session you get. They spend lots of time with you and actually listen to what it is you want to focus on, providing a realistic regimen designed for you in particular. I would totally recommend joining here.

It's also really spacious with plenty of equipment, and the crowd is a lot friendlier than many of the other gyms around town. It's not like a meat market, and I never have felt pressure to compete with folks like you sometimes do. (If she can lift that much weight, then surely I can!)They have good group classes, which is always nice. I would have stayed a member longer if I hadn't decided to put my fitness funds toward Yoga One. If you're looking for a gym, I'd recommend this as the best in town unless you can afford one of the swanky uptown ones.
