5	So I had to return a box via FedEx but I had duct taped it because I did not have packing tape at home. The owner/employee(?) could have cared less and let me ship out my box as is but instead she retaped it with packaging tape. How nice of her! She said that I wasn't suppose to send boxes with duct tape and that FedEx probably wouldn't have retaped it for me. I really appreciate good businesses like these and appreciate the tip!
5	Very nice people. Great service. To the owner, never sell this business, ever!
5	I've been coming to this store for a couple of years. Always very good service here. Tom makes you feel at home. Do wish mailbox hours are extended but oh well, the service keeps me coming back.
