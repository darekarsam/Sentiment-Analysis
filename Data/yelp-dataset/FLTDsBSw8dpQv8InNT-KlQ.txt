4	See, here's the thing: I am on a regimen, this summer.  A watching-what-I-eat, running-every-morning regimen.  It has some benefits; namely, the twenty pounds I've shed.  It does, however, make it a lot harder to eat out when running errands .For example, earlier this week, I had just gone to the eye doctor at the Carolina Place Lenscrafters, and I was milling around the mall, waiting for my new glasses to be ready within the promised hour.  It was lunch time, but healthy food court options seem limited.  I finally settled on Great Wraps.  They had quite the line going, and they smelled good, so I figured they must be good.My figuring turned out to be correct.  I had a hummus veggie wrap in a spinach tortilla, and while it wasn't the best thing I've ever eaten, its quality actually surprised me.  The hummus was smooth and garlicy and the vegetables were fresh and crisp.  It was affordable, too: you can get a combo for somewhere between seven and eight dollars.  If you're in Carolina Place, you should give Great Wraps a try.
5	Great food and great service!!! Quick and very polite. Can't wait to try all their wraps. Chipotle chicken was awesome! Ultimate fries totally worth it. Free drink refills just like Chic-fil-A. Food was fresh and they will make to order if you are picky. We came to the food court just for this, not for mall shopping. Next door to Dairy Queen for dessert...bonus!
