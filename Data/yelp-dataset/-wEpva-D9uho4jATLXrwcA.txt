5	Took my girlfriend here, my mother is the owner. She does quality work and uses the best products available, she's been doing nails for more than 10 years and has a lot of clients that follow her from her previous work places just to get their nails done from her. I promise everyone that comes here will not be disappointed with their nails. She also does waxing and facials too!
5	Love Love this place! It is very clean, they use great products and take a lot of pride in their work. I go to Crystal and she does an amazing job!! Try them out you will not be disappointed by far the best nail place! Reasonably priced with great options!
