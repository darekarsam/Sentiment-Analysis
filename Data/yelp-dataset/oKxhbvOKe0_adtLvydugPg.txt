5	Garrett was so great to deal with!! The cleaning was great - white carpet with lots of tread and mystery stains - dogs & kids are liars ;)  but he was very reasonable, right-on with his quote, and even removed some tougher stains at no extra charge. I also had a small hole that he patched and replaced for about $50 less than I was quoted by others.  A super nice guy to deal with and definitely wanted to make his customer happy - I will use him for all carpet/tile cleaning from now on and refer him to family and friends!!
5	Absolutely incredible!  Not only does Garrett do great work, but his pricing is incredible too.  Never looked forward to getting my carpets done in the past, but now I have him on auto schedule lol.  Thanks so much for doing such a great job every time!  Oh and don't forget they do car upholstery and tile too!
5	Garrett is super professional & knows his stuff. He's cleaned the carpet in my home before, but he's also really helped me with the inside of my truck. I have carpeted panel in the back that was soaked from a spill of transmission fluid that I was carrying. I noticed the spill because of the smell which was terrible. I couldn't event sit in truck with the windows down & not have it drive me crazy. Prospectors Carpet Cleaning cleaned my spill in the truck & now it's like new! Thanks Garrett!
