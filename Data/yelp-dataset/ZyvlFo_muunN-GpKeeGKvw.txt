4	Nice guys, good customer service, quick move, just a bit of scratches between moves but overall a good experience.
4	Great experience... professional and courteous at the lowest price I have seen in the city. One note: you may need to provide protective wrapping and padding around delicate furniture or glass yourself, as in my experience they did not provide this service by default. However, they provide a great service for those needing to move quickly on a tight budget.
5	College Inc Movers guys are great: friendly, quick, and very affordable. All of this and most importantly, there was no damage to any of my belongings. I love the concept behind the company and the work ethic of this crew. Definitely would recommend them & use again!
5	Received great customer service when booking these movers and their prices are the most reasonable I've seen in Pittsburgh.  The two men that helped me move were polite, fast, and professional (thank you Andre & Kenny!).  They called ahead of time to let me know they were on their way and even got there early.  I would definitely recommend using them and will be using them again in the future.  Moving can be so stressful but these guys made it a relatively easy transition.
