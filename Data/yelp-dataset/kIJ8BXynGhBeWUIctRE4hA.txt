5	I have been using the pottery lab here for 2 weeks now and gotta say, this is an ideal place for me to do pottery. I have been doing pottery for a while and don't really care to take anymore classes so the owner allowed me to just us the lab. The rate is good, for 90$ /month I get to use the lab whenever I want, as long as I'm not interrupting a class or there all day everyday.The lab it's self is a decent size and is rumored to be expanding soon. Right now there are approximately 14 wheels, a hand building area, wash area, and everyone gets their own utility shelf.Since I haven't taken the classes I can't speak onto that experience, however the owner, Andy, is rather skilled with clay and I would think he could teach the ropes quite well. He is very down to earth and you can tell he does this for the love of art not money.I have been to several pottery labs in different area's and within a short period of time, this is the most relaxed place to do pottery, not to mention it's not ridiculously over priced like "Dish It Out".
5	hi all,its a amazing place to learn pottery.I have been there for 2 weeks and Andrew is so patience and guides u so well.If you are looking for learning basics and become creative this is the place.
4	I'm a photographer and painter by hobby standards. I came here (when they were located on Central Ave) for potery class. I Had a GREAT time. Andrew is como de sey...... AWSOME!!!!!Great instructor. The ppl in the class with me at the time already knew each other and welcomed me with open paint strokes. In school I looked up to the late great Bob Ross.. (Mr. Happy Clouds himself).. Even though Bob was a painter.. Once I created my sculpture I was able to get my "BOB ROSS" on..lolGo have fun... enjoy... (don't know if he still does...but at that time we were allow to bring an adult beverage... just make sure you bring him one... I think his beer of choice was St. Pauli Girl)Cheers
