4	I'm all for Oral hygiene, and CDVM helps me maintain my pearly whites every 6 months!I've lived all over North America, and this dental facility ranks highly among the others I've been to.  The dentists here, specifically Dagenais and Fox are both very professional, and very knowledgeable.  They have modern dental equipment and x-ray machines.   I came here for wisdom teeth assessment and a teeth cleaning, and both times I satisfied.  They hygienists are also very well trained.If you are interested in getting your teeth cleaned, or have a more serious issue, these guys can handle it.
5	Great quality service.. Wendy Fox is definitely good dentist to ask for..
5	I've been going to Dr.Michel Kakon for years. I went from having an awful bite, to grinding/jaw issues. All of it was fixed so professionally, with very little pain.Great set up, professional, modern setting. I recommend for anyone and any situation. They have the staff to fix it.
