5	This location runs a tight ship. Super fast really hot food that is ridiculously delicious.  Their business is the production of tasty, hot, fresh chicken and waffle fry products and they are good at it.  Anything else is beside the point.  Plus, I don't know how or why, but their Dr. Pepper is better than anywhere else on the planet.
1	Nasty, nasty, nasty. Lines are long, their product tastes like they haven't changed the oil in months. This company evidently hates using fresh cooking oil as much as they hate gays.
4	Good quality food and great service.
