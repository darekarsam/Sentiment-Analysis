3	its panda. decent food at decent price. nothing else
4	It's like any other panda, if you like one you like them all same food. This one is nice and clean
1	Horrible I got hear at 845pm they close at 930 and they did not have any food on the buffet to choose from. Everything was a 15-20 minute wait to order horrible. The attendant had a face like she was pissed that I came in. Not coming hear ever again.
4	I have been to this location a million times and the food is always really good. However, the lines are always really long for a really long time and they always run out of food. The restroom was spotless and the tables are always cleaned after they are used.
3	The benefit of visiting a chain restaurant is the generally predictable consistency from store to store.  Panda Express gets the job done, although nothing particularly stands out about this location over others.  The food is good, and usually replaced often enough to be fresh.  A safe, "run of the mill" bet for lunch.
3	Food is consistent.  They updated which is nice.  Not happy that every table is dirty and so is the floor.
