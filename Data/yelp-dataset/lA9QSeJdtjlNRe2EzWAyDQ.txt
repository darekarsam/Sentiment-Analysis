3	I have been a patient here for about 3 years. This place has had so many dentists. Everytime I come its someone new. I want the same one! Also I don't like how its not private rooms, you are just seperated by furniture. Also could use some updating. On a good note my favorite person to get my teeth cleaned by is Christy. She's so nice and sweet!I like I can schedule an appointment online. The staff is always nice and willing to work with you on whatever you need!
5	Who likes going to the dentist?! Me either. But the Orangewood Sunwest Dental location makes a dreadful experience a lot easier. Not to mention the great customer service!
2	I've been coming here since 1999. I've never been seen by the same dentist twice. They always tear up the inside of my mouth when they take the x-rays. There is no privacy. They double book appts. Most recently I made an appt for a cleaning but when I got there they said it was just going to be x-rays and exam and that I would have to make another appt for the cleaning with another office visit fee and more time off work and more sitting around waiting. Then they said 3 of my fillings should be removed and replaced with crowns. I've never thought to get a 2nd opinion at the dentist until now.  I just kept going back after all these years because I knew that in 6 months there will be a whole new set of people and figured they might not be as bad. Until now. I'm switching.
