2	On the southwest corner of Sandy Porter and Tryon, you'll find this Food Lion in the strip mall. I've not shopped at many FL's, so I can't tell you if this is bigger or smaller than average. What I can tell you is that the prices here seem higher than Harris-Teeter, Bi-Lo, Wal-Mart and Super Target. While they have everything you need for a full grocery shop, including frozen, dairy, produce, beer, wine and meats, it's not going to be cheap.If you do decide to shop with the Lion on a regular basis, pick up one of their MVP shopper loyalty cards - this will save you a good bit.
3	This particular Food Lion is tucked into a recently developing area... kind-of Whitegate, kind-of Steele Creek. However, definitely had some questionable expiration dates for dairy products, and vegetables were decent at best. Check the milk dates!
2	It's a pretty standard Food Lion.I normally am not a Food Lion shopper, but for whatever reason, everything I was looking for on sale here this week. The layout is pretty typical, walk directly in to produce, the milk and cheese are in the back left corner and meat is all along the back wall.Some of the produce looked a bit questionable, so I left that alone. But everything else I went in for was in stock. Service was average, there was a small crowd of cashiers that were too engaged in conversation to see me ready to check out.Eventually, I was checked out and on my way. I don't foresee this being my "main" grocery store. But if everything else I want is on sale again, you'll definitely find me here.
4	A good spot for quick pick-up items when the lines and other joys of Walmart are not desired.  Found this Food Lion to be clean and well stocked.  Great spot for some fruits and veggies on the go..
