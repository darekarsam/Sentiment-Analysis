5	Worked with Richard and has a great, easy and professional experience. No slick taking salesman, just a good straight to the point and knowledgable sales associate. Will only go here for future purchases.
5	Me and my wife had an amazing experiences working with Jacob. He was knowledgable and helped us think through what mattress was best for us. He went above and beyond to make sure we got a great deal.
5	I had planned to just go in and look, but I started chatting with the sales rep, Cara, and she was very warm and not pushy, thank God.I walked out having bought a Tempur-Pedic Cloud Luxe.  So needless to say she and Mattress Firm did a great job.
