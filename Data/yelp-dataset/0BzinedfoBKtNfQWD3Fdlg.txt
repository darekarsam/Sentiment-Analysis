1	This Arco is a nightmare. Saw two different arguments within 5 min bc it's a cluster you know what.Then my husband goes in to pay and the debit card machine eats his card! The employee who worked there had a hard time believing it and two or three times, insisted he check his wallet and that it could not have happened. A bit irritating, like we'd make something like this up...She did however contact the manager, who said she'd be on her way in about 10 min, but realistically what is the manager gonna do, I doubt she has access to that machine and would have to call another person for that job. So we just decided to go to his bank, cancel his card, and get a new one, and we got gas at a 76 station up the street. Cheaper is not always better!
1	Agree with other review - it is a nightmare.   Got there at shift change. They completely close down for about 15 minutes. No gas. No convenience store.  How come other similar businesses are able to operate without closing?! Time to update technology or something.   A gas station/"convenience" store that is unreliable defeats the whole purpose.
