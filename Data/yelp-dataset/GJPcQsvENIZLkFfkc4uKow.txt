4	Prices are fair compared to other Hand Car Washes, but these guys go to great lengths to make sure you're happy with the results! Kudos!!!
2	Prices are fair but 45 minutes to wash and vac my car? That's a little much. Undecided if I'll be a returning customer.
1	Prices are good BUT for an hr car wash!? SERIOUSLY!? They never used to be this slow but now I see that they have brand new ppl!!! Wen they first opened this place up they were fast & the guys that ran the car wash were AWESOME!!! I got to know them by name, I'm so disappointed that they let them all go for a whole new crew... I don't think I'll come back here again :/
