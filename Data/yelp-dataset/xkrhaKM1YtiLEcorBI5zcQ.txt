4	Tasty food, good pizza and reasonable prices for a non-chain small business.  I've always done take out but when picking up have noticed the interior is probably exactly the same as when it opened many decades ago.  I guess that adds charm for some and is a detractor to others.  Nonetheless, I'm happy to see a small business still in business and will continue to order from them
1	Don't waste your time or money.  My salad had a rotten tomato and a hair (not mine).  My waitress never offered another hairless salad even if I had wanted one.  The broiled flounder wasn't very hot and neither were my steamed veggies.  Both were SO BLAND I could have prepared a better version at home.  My mom had spaghetti with meat sauce and said it was just mediocre.  The owner asked how our meal was when I paid and insisted they use fresh tomatoes.  I'm sure they do but I had to spit mine out.  She discounted our drinks but I'll never be back!
5	The eggplant Parmesan is FABULOUS!   My friend always has the pizza and says it is really good.  Service is friendly.  Its clean.  Local place that I will continue to come back to again and again!
