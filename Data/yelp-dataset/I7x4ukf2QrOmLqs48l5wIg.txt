5	I am a UdeM student and this is just a right place.They give good quantity and quality foods with a reasonable price. Specially when you are at your midterm or final and you don't have time to cook nor bring your foods. You call for a delivery for a Mixed Plat under 15$. And you will feel happy.Recommended to try this place at least once if you study near by.
