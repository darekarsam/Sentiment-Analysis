5	Oh, Veterans Park. How you so lovingly sit quietly along Central Ave with so many amenities. Not many people know of how accessible and resourceful this little Plaza Midwood assett truly is. Stomp the break, the entrance comes up quickly, and pull up the long drive into the abundant parking lot. There are several tennis courts open for public use that stay lit into the evening hours. Get your game face on, shave that McEnroe mustache and grab your racket. Some experienced players show up to these courts on a daily basis. This facility is perfect for an afternoon pickup game of softball/baseball, basketball or bocce. Also, many mountain bikers can be seen riding throughout the small wooded area and more open fields. Bring the kiddos, too. There's a fantastic playground and, dare I say, a fantastic covered water fountain pavilion. Don't have kids? Pshh. Even the adults will have fun. Jets of water spraying out of the ground make for laughable memories and beat the heat like your mama didn't know. There are plenty of trees to sit under and get in an afternoon of reading with your current literary treasure as well. I love this park and miss frequenting several times a week. One of the more quiet parks in town and is worth a visit!
4	Beautiful park, even in the middle of winter. Came on such a pleasant late December day, and I'm like: where are all the kids? Shouldn't they be playing outside? Are they all stuck on their PlayStations and iPads indoors? A shame. Anyhoo, the only drawback of this park is that it's located smack dab next to a military vehicle armory, which kind of puts a damper on things. But it's large, has plenty of ballfields, and has just a nice view all around.
4	I typically enjoy coming here to play tennis, but I gotta tell you, it's annoying when people occupy the courts playing everything BUT tennis. The smell of marijuana is off-putting as well, but that's fairly rare.All in all, it's a nice place to come to.
