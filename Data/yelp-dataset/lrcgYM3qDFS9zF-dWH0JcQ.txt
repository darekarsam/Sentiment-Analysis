4	If Dr's are your thang.. then this store is amazing... I have always wanted a pair of maroon mid Dr Marten boots... so I can't go past this store on Princes St without a slight detour in to admire the boots I covet so much but have never quite been able to bring myself to buy... *sigh*They also sell the ever so trendy right now satchels.... and some Dr clothing... Well worth a looksee!

4	After stomping around The UK for two days in my slipper flats, it was time to get serious.  I'd had a pair of Docs in the oxford style for a long time, but retired them years ago, and I'd wanted to replace them.  Doc Martens shoes are so comfortable once broken in, and very durable.  And really classic.  Ahh....Doc Martens store in downtown Edinurgh, plus a sale.  Done.The service was good here.  It was very busy and full of tourists, but we managed to walk out with two new pairs of Docs.  His & Hers.  Not matching.  He got some proper black ten-hole boots with peg laces at the top, while I got the eight-hole black canvas with flowers.  Although we changed our mind a few times and tried on several pairs, they were patient and helpful, and made us feel right at home.One comment: they hand foreigners Value Added Tax paperwork that goes to an intermediary who takes a large cut of the VAT refund (67%!).  I certainly see their right to do so, but it's better for tourists to just file their own claim and receive the full VAT.
