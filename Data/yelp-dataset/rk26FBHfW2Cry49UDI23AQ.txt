4	One of the most specialised costume jewellery shops in Scotland and a one-of-a-kind in that respect, Chic and Unique certainly give you an eyeful of bold, brash (but beautiful) necklaces.With lavishly ornate pieces dating as far back as the Victorian era, Chic and Unique is more like a museum than a shop since I'd be terrified to lose any of this stuff if I ever bought it! The neck pieces are definitely in the statement jewellery category, and thus would look great in a period drama or for playing an outlandish character. Bulky but gorgeous, each piece of jewellery has a story in here - even the hair accessories - and you can read about their origins on the pieces of card beside the items.Everything is pricey in Chic and Unique, and consequently out of reach in their glass cabinets. But for an occasion which warrants a beautiul piece with a bit of history, this would be my first stop. It has the elegance and glamour of other eras and the shop owner has captured the personality of jewllery shopping in the glory days of the 20s. Basically, before everything was mass produced tatt.Because it is so regal, I can only catch a glimpse of these glittering prizes. But this is a haven for collectors and lovvies everywhere!
3	What a great name!This shop is really good if you're into costume jewelery and statement pieces. It's not really my thing, but they have some wonderful things in here.As Marj C has said, they have really traditional pieces with a modern twist. Their brooches caught my eye, they would absolutely finish off an outfit or a nice jacket. I said to myself I would come back when my student loan comes in.If you're into statement jewelery and amazing one-off pieces then this is your place. It's something quite special!
