4	Although merchants of fine wine don't feature in my list of most visited places, the Cristal on display and other alcoholic fancies available in Nicolas made for an interesting browse.What makes Nicolas approachable is the helpful owner; an informative Frenchman whom obviously has a passion for all things wine.Rather than wandering around aimlessly looking at confusing grape varieties and brands, ask a few questions, poke and prod a bit (metaphorically speaking!) and no doubt you'll find a gem.
