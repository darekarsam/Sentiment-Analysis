1	This store, which usually has pretty decent if not good customer service,  gave me a HORRIBLE customer experience recently!! I came to the store during reg business hours (around 2:00 in the afternoon) & the kid who was working put a sign on the door "be back in 15 minutes". I went home & came back 15 minutes before closing hours & the rude, non-business-understanding kid who left earlier (I'm sure without the owner knowing) told me they were closed (15 minutes before 8!!) I was turned away twice on the same day. I needed water since me & my kids had none at home.  I told the young man that I had been there earlier & was turned away by the "be back in 15 minutes" sign but he still wouldn't let me in...15 MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING TIME!! .  I will never give my business to this store again!
5	They Always have water. Ive been getting h2o here for about 6-8 months. Never have had an issue .They have a bunch of snacks and the  ice cream is good .
2	Just stopped by to get my girls a treat. One wanted a snow cone and the other ice cream cone. The guy at the counter was not very friendly, I'm usually a leave me alone type of person but this guy acted as If we were bothering him. They didn't have cherry flavored syrup so both girls had to settle for ice cream. We asked for one Oreo flavored on a cone and a cotton candy on a cup. First he said they didn't have Oreo flavored until my daughter pointed it out to him. Then he could not remember which flavor went on a cone and which went on a cup. After multiple repeats he got it. I was tempted to get a Mexican raspado but I noticed they were pre made, they had cups of mango with chamoy and some of those chamoy straws already inserted.  I'm guessing all they do is add ice but anyone who has ever had a Mexican mangoneada knows those straws dissolve after a short time when they are inserted in chamoy. This place has a lot of potential but it is very poorly ran
