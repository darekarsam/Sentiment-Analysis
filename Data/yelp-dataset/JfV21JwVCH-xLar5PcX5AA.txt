5	Great pedi-Manila!
1	If you want your nails to look the uglesssstttt  they can be come here they did a horrible horrible  job I told them I was not happy with the work and they acted likey they could not hear me I paid $55 plus gave them a $ 10 tip before  because I don't like to go back in my bag and dig for money and mess my nails up but never again will I do that... The guy that did them did a job like it was his first time horrible job Ooooo and on top of that he cut me .....
4	I had a great experience here! Went in last minute and was able to get in right away! Tom did my nails and he was amazing. Good nails and gives great massages ! I liked this place. Wasn't crazy about it being in Walmart, but other than that good experience! I
5	I went here based on the previous two reviews. It was on a Friday afternoon.  My pedicurist was Joe and he was amazing!  He does a great foot massage and was very friendly.  The whole experience was about 30 minutes.   The place is cramped but worth visiting.
