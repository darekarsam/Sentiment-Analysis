2	I'm not crazy about Taco Bell. I only go there under protest.  I can only stomach their Nachos Bellgrande but I never get the beef on it. I've heard terrible things about their beef. Ever since there was some sort of health scare a few years ago, they stopped carrying green onions and they're sorely missed. I find myself drowning my meal with their hot/mild sauces and a side of jalapenos. I used to get their tacos years ago until one day I bit into it and found the lettuce was rancid. I was sick the next several days and didn't go back to Taco Bell for a couple of years after that experience.Your pal,Walter
3	A bump up in the rating for introducing a Doritos taco.That's what I said.A Doritos taco.A Doritos-shelled hard taco with the magic orange-cheese pixie dust that stays on your fingertips.Still, I wish they'd do something to improve their beef. Seriously.Your pal,Walter
5	I freaking love TB! Get baja dewski, it'll change your life if you let it.
4	When your on a small budget this place hits the mark. Cheap, Fast, and Filling !! Who needs Roman Noodles when you have Taco Bell ! It just works. For Indain Trail its a welcome addition to the fast food markets i think anyway.
