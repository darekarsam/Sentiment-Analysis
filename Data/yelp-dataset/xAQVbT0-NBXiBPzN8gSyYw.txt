5	I have used Smith Plumbing in the past but most recently to fix a drain issue.  The plumber was friendly, on time and gave me advice on fixing a few other issues around my home.  Had a great experience so if you need a good plumber in the Tempe/Ahwatukee/Chandler area, give them a call.
1	Do not use Smith Plumbing.  Left my house a complete mess after a sloppy repair.  They do not carry the most basic plumbing supplies on their trucks, had to make many trips to Home Depot.
1	The plumber did not show up on two consecutive days when scheduled.  Did not take or return my calls until the end of the second day.  The office was no help and claimed it did not know the schedule of the plumbers, as unbelievable as that is because you schedule through them.  Had one very incompetent plumber who wanted to charge me a few thousand dollars for repairs that were not needed.  I went to another plumber and had the repair work done for a couple hundred dollars.
