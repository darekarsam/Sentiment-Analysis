4	So I was out in the greater Phoenix area and stayed out here in SURPRISE! yeah I think its always a Surprise in Surprise haha... but my buddy needed to pick up some cash and deposit a check before we went to the USC vs ASU game. So what were we to do but head over to the bank.Well surprise surprise... Arizona still has drive up tellers... That kicks azz! I miss these in California. None the less they also have an ATM island to conduct your bidness at afterhours or if the drive thru is busy.Pro Tip: Drive thru, walk in, or ATMs who could ask for more?Well we had a quick n easy trip to this branch. Friendly, lots of AC inside I would imagine (we didn't go in), easy to navigate drive through lanes. What more do you need?How about a quick n easy transaction and we were in and out and didn't have to leave the car. Talk about nice and wonderfully easy. Great quickie trip to the bank. I wish that we had the drive through tellers in California still...
5	Excellent customer service! Everyone at this location is always helpful and quick with my transactions!
1	After waiting for an hour to do a wire transfer the bank representatives at this location are by far the worst Wells Fargo employees I have ever dealt with, customer service here is terrible at store #00754224.
