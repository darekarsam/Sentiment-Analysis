5	100% the best sushi I have had in Arizona, and maybe even California too.Ahi tuna done very well. Las Vegas-esque roll rolled in panko, check. Calamari, thanks much. Waffle dessert with vanilla ice cream, holy *#%^.Proud girl from the bay, I know my fish baby.Oh, and manager boy...hey ;)
4	I would give it all 5 stars but i don't want it to go to their heads.  They just opened and I have only been here this one time.  Anyway I am so happy a more than decent sushi bar is in the neighborhood.  I am sure i will be adding the 5th star soon. By the way the service was awesome Mike and John are tops.
5	Excellent sushi. The service was outstanding. Quality and freshness superb! Will be going back very soon to this neighborhood gem!
4	Delicious, but pricey.  The fried tofu was amazing.  All of the sushi was fresh and delicious.  I have heard they have a wonderful happy hour.
5	Great place. Still new so it was not that busy. We sat outside and the ambience was perfect. There was a waterfall and the heaters kept us warm. Everyone was really attentive and went out of their way to be helpful; they let us try the "real" wasabi and brought me a cute little desserts for my birthday that worked with my food allergies. Michael was our server and he was entertaining and nice. The food was great. We had edamame, miso, and galbi (pork) for appetizers. They were all better than average. The sushi was fresh. We had the tuna tataki roll, tuna roll, shrimp and tuna nigiri, and cali roll. I will definitely be back very soon!
5	Such fresh fish, like it just came off the boat!  All of our sushi was amazing and we tried a bit of everything at our table. No overpowering sauces or gravy-like cover ups here. The fish took center stage. Enjoyed the fried tofu appetizer, too!  Great place and we will be back!
