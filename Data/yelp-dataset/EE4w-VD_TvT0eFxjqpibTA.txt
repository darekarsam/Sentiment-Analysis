4	Saved my photo taking life, my camera's battery was dying and I forgot to bring my battery charger.  They had mine instock with a multi sized battery charger for around $50.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.
1	Well, I went in today to buy 4 2032 batteries and a couple 18650 batteries. The guy at the counter got the 2032's and then asked what I was using the 1850's for. I told him for an electronic cigarette. He said we can't sell you batteries. I told him I can do whatever I want with a battery. He said they will explode in my face... Uhh are you kidding me? Do I look like I am 4 years old?  What if I had said I was from the future and they were for a laser gun? Would they have advised me that a laser gun could kill someone? They sell car batteries, don't people get killed in car accidents.
5	We are at the batteries plus for business at least 1 time a week and these people are so knowlagable about all battary products . They take care care of us every time we need special ordering and special works on batteries . I would recommend them to anyone..
