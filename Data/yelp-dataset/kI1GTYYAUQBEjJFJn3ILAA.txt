4	Great burgers, hot and cold sandwiches, fries and onion rings. They serve breakfast too but don't open till 8am so I gave them only 4 out 5 stars.Update - 8/18/10 - You gotta try the bacon wrapped deep fried hot dog. Awesome! It might sound greasy but, not one bit.
2	Ok, this place has been around a long time, so I was expecting something great. The prices were very high for what you get. There was very little meat on my sandwich and it really wasn't very good. I won't go there again.
1	Usually good burgers. Service not so great. Had lunch there today. Ordered large drink and fries. Cashier (same old guy that has been there forever) reached for a large cup and handed it to me. Only tea is outside of the counter, and I wanted a Coke. So I asked for a Coke and he took the large cup, returned it to the counter, and gave me a smallish cup with Coke. I asked if I had correctly order a large drink, to which he replied yes. But since we have free refills this is your cup for Coke!!!!!! When I pay for something, something that I took the time to order, that is what I expect. Seemed like this guy wanted to save a few cents for Spoons Grill. And on another note, their fries seemed to no longer be fresh cut homemade but rather were store bought. Guess they have cut back on their costs. Losing the appeal of a one-off grill.
5	This place is just a hidden gem! My husband and I have been going there for years. Double Bacon with fries and a single cheese with onion rings are a must!! Such a wonderful Steele creek burger joint!
