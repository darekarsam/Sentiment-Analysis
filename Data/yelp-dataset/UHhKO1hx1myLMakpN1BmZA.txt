4	My mom suffered a stroke about 13 months ago.  She's recovering nicely and finally decided she'd like to add a puppy to the household.  So on a recent Saturday trip to Petsmart at Carolina Place, we adopted Irving through the York County Animal Shelter.Irving needed a vet so we called Curt, one of her therapists after her stroke.  Curt is a doggie dad to Yurok, who works part time with Curt as a therapy dog.  Curt (and Yurok) recommended Palmetto Pet Hospital and Dr Dawn Martin.We had Irving's first puppy visit with Dr Martin yesterday.  It's a very small office so getting an appointment took a week.  But we were very impressed with Dr Martin and with all of her staff.  All seemed very knowledgable, genuinely caring about the animals and they all took the time to answer our questions (who knew you didn't have to license a dog in SC unless required by local ordinance?). They were also very careful to provide the name and phone number - on a refrigerator magnet - of an emergency clinic for after hours and weekend emergencies.   We'll go back in two weeks to keep Irving on his schedule of puppy shots.  Giving this practice and Dr Martin four stars instead of five only because of the week it took to get an appointment.
4	This practice has recently added Dr Melissa Privette to the staff.So it's now much easier to be seen by a great vet at this location!My last review was 4 stars, I'd now give it 4 1/2.Go see Dr Martin and Dr Privette!
5	The vet was so attentive and did the best for my sweet kitty. So grateful!
