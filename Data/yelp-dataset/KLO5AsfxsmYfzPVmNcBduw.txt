4	What a fun concept! Not sure if we have anything like this in the states yet, but basically you pay by weight. Yes, you make your ice cream as heavy or not as you want, put any of the toppings you like on it and then get weighed and pay.The toppings ranged from fresh fruit to chocolate sauces to candy and gummy candies (ughhhh). The yogurt flavors I had were lime, cookies n cream and something else. The lime was amahhhzing!
2	Yeh was a nay for me.I did not like the the pina coloda base i chose and the strawberries were quite sad looking so I skipped them. Extremely artificial flavour, thawed toppings. Bleh.
