5	Thomas Sayre has done tons of other art installments you've seen around the city. (The big, clay discs on South blvd among others) I love seeing these big things on the way to Cotswold or heading back home/Uptown. Apparently inspired by "seed pods" from floral bearing trees, they definitely stand out. The vine-y growth that has plastered itself along the bases add a nice aesthetic to the art as well. Perhaps something that is overlooked by most (maybe close to all), but I love them every time I see them. Here, here, Thomas Sayre!
2	There are days I'm feeling artistic, even though I am not a particularly artsy person. Then there are days I wonder just what in the world people are thinking. There are pieces of art in the Queen City that are worth observing - Metalmorphosis (not the under construction version), for instance. Even Seventh Street Station, while a parking garage, has a certain interest to it because it conceals a puzzle.But the obsession in Charlotte to invest in giant, earth-colored discs? I don't get it. There are some along the light rail lines (those are solid, which on some days may be better, but there are more of them, which may make it worse).And what I don't get is that while some vegetation has started to grow at the bottom of the pieces, it never goes more than a slight bit further than that. If this would grow around the circles, so that you have these huge, lumbering, circular plants? That would be awesome. But clay circles? Pass.
1	I've been to loads of art museums. I've seen some strange scupltures. Some, I "got" and some remained a complete puzzle. Grandiflora falls into the latter category. Two large round loops that look like stirrups at the intersection of Wendover and Randolph. What's the point? Do I feel more arty after stopping at this traffic light and looking over at the sculpture? Maybe the horn honking at me caused me to lose the imagery. I don't know.It's art. But it's weird.
