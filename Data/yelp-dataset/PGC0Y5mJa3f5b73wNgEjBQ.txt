1	This McDonald's is a hit and miss. Sometimes you have the employees who actually have customer service common sense and some who obviously don't. On May 24 my two teenage kids went in at about 830am and asked for a cup of water and were told that unless they purchased something, they couldn't give them water. Pretty inconsiderate, considering it was 90+ degrees out already. Had they had $, they would likely have purchased a cup of soda instead. Funny thing is that depending on the employee, depends if the customer gets a free cup of water. Thanks older, hispanic, heftier, manager (they didn't catch her name and this is the description they gave me. She had a different colored shirt than the other employees which is why they believe she was the manager).
2	As the other reviewer said, this is hit and miss.  With the weather cooler, it can be freezing inside as they seem to continue to run the A/C.  Service is okay, but if you ask for anything special (i.e. no mayo, add cheese), they get it right half the time.  Trash is always overflowing.  Otherwise no better or worse than any other McDonald's.
1	Slow service. Did not enjoy
1	Reminded tonight as to why McDonald's is terrible? Orders NEVER are right, food is room temperature, workers are standing mindlessly, and seem to have the incorrect working agenda. They're pretty lucky I blame myself for making such a poor mistake in eating here.
