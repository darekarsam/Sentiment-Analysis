1	The worst salon ever!  DO NOT GO HERE!!!  the sign states manicure/pedicure $35 bucks.  i asked for a gel polish change.  Total was $70.00!!!!!!  I couldnt believe what a total rip off!  And, the girl in charge of my service was sloppy and quick.  I would never, ever, ever recommend this place!
1	I have NEVER had a worse pedicure. The girl that was doing my pedicure could not even be bothered to Rub in all the lotion on my legs. She was very fast with zero attention to detail.
3	After spending the afternoon doing some shopping my girlfriends and I decided to stop in for pedicures. For a Saturday the place wasn't too crowded and by the time we picked out colors the water was run and the chairs were ready. I was a little bummed they didn't offer anything I drink. Also in my opinion the selection of polish colors needed a bit more variety. But the service was fine and the prices were pretty reasonable.Although it's not my favorite shop, if I'm out and about again and in need if a pedi this makes for a decent option.
