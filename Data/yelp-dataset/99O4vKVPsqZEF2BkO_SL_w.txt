5	BEST AUTO SHOP IN THE VALLEYFamily-owned and local small business who's motto is "Does it first class or not at all" and boy do they do a GREAT job.It's hard to find a TRUTHFUL mechanic but Mark, the owner, will give it to you straight.  He prides himself on building a relationship and keeping you as a customer for life.Trust me . . . You may pay a bit more, but it's WORTH more than he charges!
5	Could not be happier with the work H & M did on my Mercedes E430.  I brought my car in on the recommendation of a friend after getting a "shocking" estimate on an A/C job from a shop closer to home.  Mark was incredibly accommodating given my need for a quick turnaround and how busy his shop seemed to be.  The work was done ahead of schedule, and I was kept informed about price and progress along the way.  I ended up having them take care of some alignment work I needed to have done, had them fix a window regulator, and got a new set of front tires from them also.  There were no cost overruns (something I've learned to expect from other mechanics) and I ended up paying less than the original quote.An honest and professional mechanic is hard to find, I'm glad to have found H & M!
