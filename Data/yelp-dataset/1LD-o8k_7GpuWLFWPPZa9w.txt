5	I won't go anywhere else. The girls at this store really do a great job. Claudia and Cindy are pretty good. They are very friendly and thorough. Juan is good for Men's cuts as well as women. They give you a really good shampoo and a haircut.
1	Can't believe I spent 15$ on a cut and then tipped 5$ after this lady messed my hair up so bad. She did not listen to what I asked her to do, then cut my hair so short and uneven that I had to go somewhere else and spend another 15$ plus tip just to try to fix it. I will never go back to this location again, or any supercuts for that matter. Bish gave me a fecking bowl cut. I could have done that myself, thanks a lot supercuts, u should change your name to superuglycuts.
