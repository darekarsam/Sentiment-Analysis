5	Kenji's service was unmatched. I asked Kenji for the places to go and things to do in Vegas and was pleased to get instant responses and  great advice. Kenji reccomended I go to Light Nightclub and it was one of the craziest nights I can remeber. I was taken care of at the door and didn't wait in line at all. All my needs were met and I give Kenji's service the highest rating possible. Next time I go to Vegas I know who to call...and everyone reading this should do the same.
5	Kenji is a dope guy to know if you're planning to make your way to Sin City. I took a last minute trip out a couple weekends ago and I let him know at the last minute and he was about to take care of me while I was out there. He got me connections at the clubs I planned to go to and even gave me suggestions in case my crew wanted to do something else with our night. Kid knows his clubs and how to have a good time out in LV. If you're planning a trip out to Vegas do yourself a favor and let Kenji hook you up.
5	Kenji is awesome!  Whether it be planned out or last minute Kenji takes care of you and everything you need.  I took a group of girls for a 21st birthday and he delivered.  The girls are still talking about the trip and it is all because of Kenji.  I will definitely use his services again.
5	Kenji is the only man you need to know in Vegas, period! He is always quick to respond to calls or texts, always professional, and always makes sure you have the best experience possible! I call him for anything and everything Vegas and he never ceases to amaze me. Don't even think about calling anyone else!
