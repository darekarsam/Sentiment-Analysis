5	What would Pittsburgh do without Time Bomb. It is the best store for urban clothing in all of Pittsburgh! Similar to Next in Cleveland and Standard in Atlanta. I have been copping from there for over 10 years! It it located in the Shadyside area of the city bordering East Liberty near Villa, David's Shoes and Ace Athletic. They offer tons of brands for men and women like Artful Dodger, Cold Chillin, Crooks & Castles, Dime Piece, Evisu, Five Four, G Shock, LRG, Married To The Mob, Play Clothes, Kid Robot, The Year Of and many more. They also carry both local and national mix tapes and also have artist's coming through the store to show love. If you're ever in Pittsburgh looking for some fresh gear and music make a trip to Time Bomb! Get ya life right! What up Brick?!
4	Hats? They got some sweet stuff. Shirts? Stuff you won't get anywhere else. Socks? They got you covered. Great staff and cool location. Go check this place out.
5	TimeBomb is without a doubt the best spot in Pittsburgh to get all the exclusive Raw street merchandise. This is my favorite store in the city not only because of it's selection of merchandise, but for it's uniqueness. The owner Brick who started the store in '95 I believe is a great guy who always takes care of his loyal customers. I've received free apparel, stickers, DVDs, mixtapes, you name it from Brick. He's a man who knows how to keep his customers coming back! All in all TimeBomb is the place to shop in Pittsburgh if you're looking to "Get Your Life Right"
