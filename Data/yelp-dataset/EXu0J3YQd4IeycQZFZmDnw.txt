5	Just randomly found this place. And it is great!!  Michael the owner was great. It was a better deal than lowes and homedepot. They were sincere and very easy to talk to. They did a great job and I can't ask for more than that.
5	Exceptional work, work done in a few days n the quality of the product are way cheaper compare to the other guys I checked around town.
5	When I met the owner Michael I knew I was making the right choice with Vegas Flooring Direct.  He was super knowledgeable and helped me find the perfect premium  tile and carpet selections for my new high rise condo.  His store offers great choice and his crew managed to install my whole project in record time.  Michael was personally on site everyday for hours making sure everything was according to standards and schedule.  My building only allowed for a brief work window on weekdays and he and his crew managed to deliver and the results speak for themselves.  If you want a flooring company that can get you a great price, provide excellent customer service before, during, and after the project, you cannot go wrong with Vegas Flooring Direct!
