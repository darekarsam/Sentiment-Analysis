5	We recently moved from Florida 2 months ago and took a shot in the dark on a pediatrician. So glad this is where we came! We had dr. Levine and she is absolutely amazing - probably one of the best dr's we have ever had. She spent so much time with us learning about our children. I really felt like she truly cares! I would recommend her to anyone!! Very clean and super friendly staff to - which is always a bonus!
5	Moved from Columbus, OH and found this practice.  Great doctors and staff!
