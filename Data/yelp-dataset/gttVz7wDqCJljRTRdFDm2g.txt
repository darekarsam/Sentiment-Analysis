4	One of the many sandwich shops on this street which has the advantage of being the only shop from which you can take your tasty treat into the opposite Blind Poet and Peartree pubs to eat. Why these two pubs don't just make the sandwiches themselves beats me, but Good 2 go usually has a very good lunch deal of panini, soup and fruit for just under 4 pounds making it an ideal spot to head for lunch. The sandwiches I have had here are fresh and their is a satisfying choice of fillings well. Lunch= sorted.
