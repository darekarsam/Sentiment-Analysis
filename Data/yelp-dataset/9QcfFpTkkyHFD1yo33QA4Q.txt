5	We have used One Brick Tech for three website projects.  As our company gets bigger One Brick Tech has been there to help us grow our company.   Vish is very professional and easy to work with.  When he gives a deliverable date they stick to it.
4	Such a great company!  We used One Brick Tech for our company website and are very happy with the results. Vishnu is great to work with especially when we weren't very knowledgeable about what we needed.  He helped us understand what our options were and how best to accomplish our goals.  Results are always fast and Vishnu is sure to follow up to make sure  it comes out how we had intended. We continue to use One Brick Tech for site updates and modifications as we keep our site fresh and growing.  I highly recommend this company.  Everyone asks who did our site and I am always proud to say One Brick Tech.
5	I wish to recommend, in the strongest possible terms, this web design company.  One Brick Tech created the web site for our start-up.  Our vision was made a reality thanks to this company.  From the start,, I was thoroughly impressed with the responsiveness and timeliness of the work, and the affordability of the cost.  I am very happy with the results, and I have OBT to thank for creating a user-friendly and attractive web site.  I have used overseas companies before for web work, but will no longer do that because of my very positive experience with OBT.
5	It's been great working with Vish & his team at OBT. Vish & his team are very professional, knowledgeable & creative. They respect timelines and closely worked with us during every step of the site development process. Very cost effective & the final product is better than how we envisioned it. I recommend, working with OBT for any web, mobile solutions.
