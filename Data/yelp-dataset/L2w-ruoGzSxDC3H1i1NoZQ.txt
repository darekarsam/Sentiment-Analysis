4	Have been going to Dr. Abby Roberts for 2 years now and she's fab!!Town Center Medical is very clean and has an adjacent parking garage to avoid hot car after your business. Location is pretty centralized and located in Old Town.**TIP: Don't take the slow-ass elevator. Take the stairs - it's healthier for you anyways...
1	Dr. Abby Roberts: Medical history was incorrectly recorded.  Requests for x-rays and reports ignored. Online patient communication system was not good, often crashed, and office staff did not know much about it.  Medical information was cookie-cutter and incorrect for my individual situation. I had to point this out to the doctor to get it correctly revised.   Information on the online system was not mentioned by the doctor during the exam, which meant too many surprises without adequate explanation in the online comments.  I went in for an annual checkup but got only a well-woman exam, much less comprehensive. I waited an inordinate amount of time in the examination room, not the best place to wait for 45 minutes.
