1	Horrible!!  don't go to this McDonald's .  I asked if I could please have fresh French fries because they had been setting for a long time - Manager said they were fresh . when I disagreed he said I was wrong and the fries were fine. nothing I ordered was fresh , not sure if this McDonalds it pinching pennies , they seem to always be busy . I will not go back ever!
5	I judge MCD by the staff and by the number of times they screw up an order. I cannot tell you how many times ive been here but its more then 10 fingers and toes.... never had bad service or screwed up food.
1	They almost always make me pull forward or mess something up. Usually it's such a small thing I don't care but after this visit, no more. I ordered a pumpkin pie which they've been pushing and it was well past the use thru time. It had been "old" for 45 minutes according to the sticker on top BUT underneath that sticker was a sticker that had a time that was MORE THAN 12 HOURS passed the USE THRU time. Disgusting. At least keep fresh stickers on the food if you are going to serve old food. Then I won't know why it's so disgusting.
3	This place got hit with a dumb bomb!  The food is ok when you get your full order, cant ask much for McDonalds though since the employees cant count higher than 2.
