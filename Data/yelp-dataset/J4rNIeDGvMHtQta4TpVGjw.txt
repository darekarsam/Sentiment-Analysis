4	Mark is the owner, and his son is Blake.  I had my main, one inch feeder line crack on me and I had to shut down the whole system (all zones) due to this.  I called Mark and lo and behold, he answered his phone.  I explained the problem and he sent Blake who came in less that 2 hours.  He worked for a couple of hours and told me that he had to leave to handle some other commitments and that be would be back.  He did come back later and finished the job very quickly and professionally.  And he invoiced me instead of wanting to be paid immediately (since I had to go out of town the next day).  And his charges are very fair.  I would highly recommend you calling these guys if you need sprinkler repairs done.
5	A valve on my sprinkler system went out, they came out and had it fixed within 30 minutes. Reasonably priced, I recommend and will use them again if the need arises.
5	I needed some help with a faulty timer/control box. Called in the morning and spoke with Mark. He was out by noon and had the problem fixed in short order. He also fixed a break in a drip line. Very pleasant and positive experience. I would recommend this company highly and will use them again if needed.
5	Used Mark and Blake about 3 times now and they have been great and responsive each time.  I bought an older house and they have helped me get my irrigation properly established.
