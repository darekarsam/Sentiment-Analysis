1	Aeroplan should be investigated for false and misleading advertising. Despite their advertising the plan is almost useless. And expensive if you consider that you will have to pay yearly credit card fees to be in the program  I tried to use my Aeroplan miles to book business class from Vancouver to Honolulu. There were no non-stop flights available even though Air Canada does have them at 6 hours flight time. The only flights available were ones with a stopover at 10 1/5 hours to 17 hours and only the short leg was business class. The longer part was economy but the miles required were if it was all business class, 160,000 miles. They have what they call "Market Fare" flights that were direct, but then the miles required were 346,800. Their advertising is a complete fantasy.
