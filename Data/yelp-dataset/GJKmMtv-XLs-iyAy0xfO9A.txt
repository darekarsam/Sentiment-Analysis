5	My wife & I went for a  foot massage & ended up with a hour massage. It was unbelievable! Before we were done, we were planning our next visit. Pam & Lucy made date night with the wife, the best night in a long while. I'd definitely recommend to any & all. You won't be disappointed.
1	Last week, walked into your location on Gilbert Road and Baseline (next to Frys) for a relaxing massage. The man used a lavender scented massage oil that has been making me go through hell.The next day, my entire face had turned crimson, puffy, and my eyes looked like someone had punched me in the face. Multitude of tiny red bumps formed on my arms and neck area.  My skin still feels like its on fire. They have not disappeared even after using oatmeal soap and nonscented lotion. I have been unable to wear any makeup or sunscreen.My skin was blemish free before coming there and even though I'm older, I had the skin of a much younger woman. Now I am frightened it will never return back to normal.Tomorrow, I have a doctors appointment and hopefully they can heal my skin from the horrible mess from the experience.
