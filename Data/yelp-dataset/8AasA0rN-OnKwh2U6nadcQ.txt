4	OKAY, I CONFESS: I'M A SHAM! All of my Polo shirts are outlet. YES, they are outlet. But hell, I only paid 30 bucks for 'em, so I ain't cryin'!I come here for my preppy fix while I'm stuck in the boons at home. They have a fantastic selection of potentially popped collars (not quite as much as the real store, but still good), and I think the styles only run a year behind, like most factory stores.  The salespeople can be a little on the pretentious tip (although working at the outlet, I feel, makes you somehow a liiiiittle less important...), but they're helpful if you've got questions.  The sales at this store are f-ing AMAZING. From t-shirts to swimwear to my beloved Polo shirts, the prices cannot be beaten (except maybe on eBay). Two thumbs up and applause!
3	I think this polo store is very small personally but maybe not....They are always out of my size with is a (L) go figure but sometimes they have ok sales.
4	Great place to get a cheap(er) supply of t-shirts. The staff are always very helpful and accommodating and will check sizes in the back if you ask.
5	I go here at least once a month to peruse the latest sales, and clothing at the Polo outlet. I like this place because they have all of the essential, classic Polo golf shirts - both the original mesh, and the interlock ones.  In addition, they have an extensive supply of t-shirts and shorts.  Yes, the sales staff is friendly, but sometimes that are too in-your-face. "No, I don't need a bag." and "Yes, I can read, therefore I don't need to be told what the sales are every 20 seconds."  Otherwise the staff is great.  Of course, this place is at Concord Mills, so its pretty much impossible to get to at any point on any weekend...
5	No other place to be! Great sales, great staff! Stop by today! Fall floor sets are INCREDIBLE!
