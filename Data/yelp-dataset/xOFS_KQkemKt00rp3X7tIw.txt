5	Excellent service and quality product these boys have perfected. They were on time and finished under the time they said it would take.  Very happy with these guys.  Referred them to my neighbors.
5	Friendly service, excellent results, low pricing. They came in at thousands less than California Closets and made our store front so beautiful - I get compliments on a daily basis. I highly recommend Alessandro and Custom Closets!
5	Moved here from Hawaii and are so happy we found this company.  They transformed our rooms to exactly what we wanted!  The workmanship was phenomenal!  They were also pleasing to work with.
5	Best experience ever!   Not only are they very competitive in price, they deliver an awesome product and quality,  and on top of it provide the best customer service experience you can imagine.  I can't say enough good things about them.  From first contact to design, to installation and even after 'customer care', they were absolutely incredible.   I just wished they would provide more 'home improvement' services, I'd hire them for everything.  Thanks Alfredo and Team!
