5	Loved this place!  Intimate and not chaotic and great trainers
5	Andrea's friday night class is awesome. I am a fighter and i enjoy the stretch and push i get from her class. A great release with even better results!
5	I've been to several classes here and enjoyed each one. The instructors are attentive and knowledgeable and they really focus on teaching the exercise correctly. By which I mean they don't let me cheat, which is a good thing in a work out class.
