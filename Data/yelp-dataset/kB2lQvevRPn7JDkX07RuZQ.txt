5	I have used many different cleaning services in the past and have not been able to find one that I can feel comfortable with.  I tried Professional Cleaners of Las Vegas and they exceeded all of my expectations.  I would reccomend them to anyone looking for A+ service and a great value.  Good job!
5	Extremely Happy!! It has been so long since I've had a reliable, punctual, and most of all exceptional work. The prices are reasonable and comparable.  My last cleaners put black marks on my baseboards and I was always having to repaint, not anymore :) they make sure my baseboards stay white. My countertop grout is so clean! Thank you!!!
5	Shannon and his crew do an unbelievable job cleaning our office each week.  They are the best at what they do!  I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a home or office cleaning company!!
5	Professional Cleaners Las Vegas did a fantastic job at my home.  They were courteous, professional and very punctual.  With my schedule, I really appreciated that.  No more cleaning the house myself, I will rely on them from now on.  Great job!
