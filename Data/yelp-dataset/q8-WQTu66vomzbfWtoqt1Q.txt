5	Went to the tanning salon and saw this new store getting ready to open for business.Came back a few days later with not only my old gold jewelery but silver also.The young ladies in the store were so nice and cute and spent a while with me.Been to other 'cash for jewelery 'places with the same items and nearly fell over whenthey told me how much they would give me!  I'm telling everyone I know that this is the only place in town to get the BEST deal.
5	Got my watch repaired.  Very professional and polite service.
4	Went to several other places to sell some gold I had they all gave me ridiculous low ball prices then I found golden trade people were so nice great customer service and great price for my gold been back 3 times since thanks guys
5	Liquidated some old jewelry here that I had received as gifts years ago. I knew that it was a good time to sell and I wanted to take advantage of gold prices being so high. I obtained quotes from a few other spots before I got to golden trade and I was shocked by the outcome. They quoted me $100 more than best quote I had previously received. Customer service was great and the storefront was nice and clean. It didn't feel like some of the dingy pawn shops I had seen prior. I highly recommend this place.
