3	Ok Italian food in the middle of Old Montreal.  Service was spotty but ok overall. Good place for kids. Bring your own bottle of wine.  Dinner was fine for a touristy place but  that price was not outrageous like the other restaurants nearby . . . just saying
4	Surprisingly well-priced meals for a little restaurant in old montreal. Wouldn't rank it in the top for dining in old montreal since there are so many impressive restaurants around, but the food is quite good. Me and my friends love this restaurant because the meals are fairly cheap and its bring your own wine which saves a lot of money. Service is always great despite us being a bunch of uni kids. Also the menu satisfies everyone.
1	Went to Giorgio's for a family reunion type lunch- there were 12 people, and understandably, larger parties take longer to serve....however, Giorgio's took an unbelievably long time for the food to come out to us. Not only did it take long, they brought out meals for 6 us, while the other 6 had to sit and wait another 30 minutes to receive their food. There is no excuse for this. Waitresses and staff were nice and polite and were apologetic (they blamed the cooks). However, nothing was compensated for the horrible experience we had there. And it took another 30 minutes to get the check.....who do they have to blame here? Food was alright... Descriptions of the menu items not available in English so it was VERY unclear on what the dishes actually contained. Had some unsatisfied family members on meals they expected and what they actually received. Prices very high for what the food. ($16 for a Caesar salad?!) We will NOT be returning to Giorgio's and I hope you will plan at least 2 hours if you plan to go there to eat....
