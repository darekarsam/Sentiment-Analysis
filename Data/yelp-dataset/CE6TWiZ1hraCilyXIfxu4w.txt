2	I came here on my lunch break at work, because it is right up the road.  They have an ecelectic menu for lunch, with a lot of gyros.  I decided on the fish gyro and called it in.  It was ready within seven minutes or so, not bad at all.  A couple of my coworkers and I came to the store together to pick it up.  The line was almost out the door, it seems really popular for people who work around here.  Honestly though I think it is just because there aren't many other choices around here.  When we got up to the counter a waitress asked the cashier, "Did they give you a tip?"  We thought she was joking so we laughed.  "Seriously," she replied.  Wow, how rude!  Not to mention my fish gyro was dry and I had to load it up with tartar sauce, thank god I was really hungry.
3	I ordered a takeout here today and ordered my FF extra crispy.  Same old limp soggy under cooked fries as usual.
5	I was hungry so I pulled in for a bite to eat not expecting much. The service was so great and personable,  and the food was great too. I had a gyro and it was one of the best I've ever had. This is now one of my go to places for breakfast and lunch when I'm in Charlotte.
3	Cheap greasy breakfast spot.  Better than a waffle house and totally worth stopping in if you are already in the area.  Not necessarily the best area to find yourself in though.I happened to be passing by one morning and feeling a little rough from the night before.  I needed some grease to soak up the leftover booze in my tummy.  It served its purpose.  Service was nice.  I think my breakfast combo was only like 3.99.
