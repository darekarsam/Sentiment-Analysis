3	The store for pastry chefs, with an emphasis on baked goods like cakes, cookies, candies and muffins. Less so for those seeking items related to macarons. A nice selection of food colours (liquid), molds and some boxes as well. Excellent if you are looking for cake making items.
5	Two levels of all your baking needs. Found it rather pricey ( but everything here is expensive). They did not have tons of variety but they are well stocked.
1	Honestly just came here on a "lets spend some money" whim... and was really disappointed by the customer service. I'd be far overestimating myself by saying that I'm a baker but I really didn't imagine they would be as put off by that as they were. They answered me in super short sentences and eventually told me they could only give me service in French...Didn't spend a dime, never will.
