5	The food was great! It was fresh and very well spiced. The inside of the restaurant and clean and comfortable. Would highly recommend this place over any other in the north east side.
5	The food is rockin' and the portions are big! Everyone was friendly and the restaurant was clean and neat. Finally a decent Chinese restaurant in my hood.
3	Quick down and dirty: Good tasting Chinese food, good prices, close to home, and they deliver.  It's not Wing Lei, but it'll do in a pinch.
5	Love this place! Food is great, fast & inexpensive. Staff is always really friendly and I love how close this location is to my house. My favorite thing here is the hot garlic shrimp. Spicy yet full of flavor.
5	Placed our order and within 5 minutes we were chowing down. Beef Pepper Steak &  Hot Garlic beef. Service was spot on. I would highly recommend this to any sit down and it could top any buffet on the north rest part of the valley.
