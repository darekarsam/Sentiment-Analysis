3	This place has its ups and downs. When I first got in the room there was a piece of poop that clogged the toilet. I had to poke it with the back of the plunger to break it up so it could flush. It really disturbs me that there could be a piece of poop that wide in the first place. With that aside I liked the layout of the room. The internet is very slow. Its great if you want to just google search all day, but if you want to watch a minute long youtube video be prepared to wait 10 minutes for it to load. But its a good price so I cant complain.
3	It did what we needed it to. Provided us with shelter, had a kitchen, and bathroom.Would prefer a central cooling system and bath supplies and soap to wash dishes in the kitchen sink
1	Dead roach on the bathroom floor when we walked in, and cigarette burns in the sheets. Think twice before you book here.
3	Stayed here for a week while waiting to move into my home.  Look it is what it is which means it's a place to sleep and make a simple meal if you have to.  Staff is friendly and the rooms are clean.
5	Friendly staff and convenient.  Don't have to put up with long check in lines.  Kitchen and refrigerator are great if you are tired of eating out all the time.
3	My husband stayed here for a business trip and I visited him. The fridge and stove are handy to save money making your own food. The room was very clean. Wish there was more silverware in the room, but the dollar store up the street solved the problem.
