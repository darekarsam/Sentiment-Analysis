5	Awesome salon, tesha is the best! Great service!
5	The best!!
4	The only reason that this salon is 4 stars not 5 is the lack of attention to detail on the inside. There were a couple light bulbs out and it could have been cleaner. On the brightest side the stylist Tom did an absolutely fantastic job on my hair cut. By far the best haircut and style I have received in Las Vegas. I would recommend anyone to go to Tom he is a master at his craft.
