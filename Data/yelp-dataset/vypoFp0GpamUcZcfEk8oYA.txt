4	I loved this cute store in Dilworth! It's in the Atherton Mill building, and it is filled with gardening items for both indoor and outdoor. They also carry gift items, and pottery items. Personally, I've been looking for an outdoor bench for our balcony and haven't been able to find anything under $300, no matter what size. Here I found one for $180, then 25% off - so happy! And it's so cute too, not just your standard squarish looking bench, it actually has some character to it. This place will inspire you to start your own garden, with all of the adorable accessories arranged in vignettes for you to see. They have truly unique items (see pic) and great prices.
