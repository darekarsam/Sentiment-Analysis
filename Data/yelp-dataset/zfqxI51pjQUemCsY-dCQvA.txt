1	DONT STAY!!!! ID RATHER STAY IN MY CAR. Horrible service when we first arrived, the employees were swearing as I was trying to check in. We got to our room & there was a hole in the wall, the carpets weren't vacuumed, our towels were dirty, the dressers didn't have handles, it was absolutely filthy.  When we asked for a new room we were moved to a room with only one bed(there was 3 of us) & we reserved a 2 bed room. We fought with staff for 2 hours to get a refund. NEVER STAY HERE.
3	Front desk people were extremely nice. It is a decent place for an emergency like in my case where my building had a fire but if you don't want to pay a lot, this is the place. This is a beautiful building but the rooms need to be upgraded... they have old tvs, old paintings on the wall, needs work but it is okay for the price. My favorite thing is their coffee in the morning and they give complimentary muffins. I was treated well by the staff, so the only bad thing i have to say about this place is the location and that it needs to be upgraded.
