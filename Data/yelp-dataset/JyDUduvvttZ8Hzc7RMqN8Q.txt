5	Very fast service. Ordered at the counter, got my drink and had my food within minutes. As fast as many fast food places, but much better. The burgers are hot, juicy, & well seasoned. Cheese curds are tremendous. The staff is very friendly. Can't wait to try the frozen custard.
5	AMAZING! everything you can ask for from a fast food restaurant! great food, customer service, atmosphere, and custard. Hands down our favorite fast food joint.
5	Waited for this Culvers to open, was not disappointed! Culvers has set a new gold standard for fast food  dining! Cheese curds were unbelievable!! Can't wait to go back!
2	The burgers were alright, but not worth the price to me, and one of the managers was really rude to my mom when we went. Probably wont be going back any time soon.
5	Glad they are here! Love the butter burgers and the custard is GREAT! Understand they plan on 3 more.
3	Food is good quality, but a bit pricey for the experience and portion size.  The staff is over-the-top friendly, which is usually nice to see.  We'll see how they do after it's been open several months. I really love the cheese curds!
