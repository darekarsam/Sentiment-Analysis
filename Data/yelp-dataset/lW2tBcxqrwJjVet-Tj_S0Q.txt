1	I did not like this place at all. When I walked in it seemed clean. So I gave it a chance. I waited only about 15 mins for a Manicure which isn't to bad for a walk in. As soon as I sat down at a station I realized that it wasn't clean at all! You could tell nothing had been cleaned in a long time! The manicure itself was rushed and the polish job was sloppy.  I know she cut me a little because when she went to remove my polish it burned like crazy!  They used lotion that smelt like motor oil to me for the message portion. I went home and scrubbed it off as best as I could. I wanted to get up and leave at this point but i didn't. I stuck around for the crappy polish job.  I will not be going back.
5	Vivian is amazing she is the best been coming here 9 years won't go anywhere else :) come here best service very clean and always happy here !!
2	Female nail tech wouldn't do design because it was to much work.. they are very ruff with ur nails cut me twice... there is one male tech that works weekends only hr is great.. will not be back..
5	I like what this place does for my nails; especially my toenails. They are thick and hard to deal with at times. Whenever I ask for a design, they always accommodate and have not been rough on me at all.
1	Not happy with this place. Went in today for a pedi and it was fine till the guy CUT me with the cuticle nippers. I've been dinged here and there before but even after getting everything done and I was drying I was still BLEEDING. Then after I was trying to take care of my wound the lady who did my mother was asking for us to pay. And I'm thinking like "can u wait I'm trying to take care of a cut here" they need to be more gentle and patient is what I can say. I don't think I'll come back.
