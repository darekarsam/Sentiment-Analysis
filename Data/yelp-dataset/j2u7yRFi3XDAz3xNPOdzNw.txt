5	Unless you really enjoy waiting in lines for an abnormally long amount of time,  I would choose a third-party MVD over the real MVD any day. Titles R Us is quick, friendly and fairly priced. They can do most services as the MVD, except driver's licenses. I work for an independent auto dealer, so I am here a little more than the average person would be, and every visit has been equally pleasant. If you do have to wait for them to complete your transaction, I recommend you bring your own reading material,  though. Their selection consisted of like a Hawaiian Airlines magazine,  fishing supply catalog, Maui Kodak photo book, and like a DeWalt catalog or something.
5	This place is great! They come to your service quickly and they treat you with respect and integrity always. The manager David Din is a great guy also. Trust me you won't regret coming to Titles R Us.
1	well, I have never done business with these folks, but I did see someone driving down I17 in a gray Toyota pickup with big yellow TITLES R US signs throwing his trash out of the window. I suppose I would avoid doing that if I was representing my company that way.When I need DMV service, I will avoid them.
