5	I bought a coupon on Groupon and had zero expectations. I walked in and the place was empty and I told my boyfriend "this should be interesting". Man was I wrong.... I even decided to ADD the business on Yelp for how fantastic it was!!! It was worth every single bite. We started off with fried calamari and grilled garlic shrimp. Super tasty and fresh; almost melts in your mouth. The main dish was a four cheese thin crust pizza and my boyfriend had the "all dressed" pizza. Omg! That's all I will say. The tomato sauce was extremely fresh, the ingredients were "garden fresh". Finally, dessert. I'm not a dessert person. At all. I would go back FOR the dessert. The Zeppolli's tasted as though my Grandma made them. Omg food-gasm!!! I'm so glad I bought this Groupon coupon and discovered this hidden gem!
3	Nice Italian right in the heart of Plateau. Pizza from a wood burning oven simply fantastic. Ingredients are all extra fresh and delightful service. Anyone looking for authentic Italian in plateau - look no further !
5	An excellent pizzeria with good food, great service and a casual warm an inviting ambience.  Tried both the prosciutto/goat cheese pizza and shrimp pasta dishes.  Both were very good, no mistaking that wood fired pizza taste! Bottle of Tertium Cantina wine was very nice and complimented both dishes well. Finished off with a very good Tiramisu.  Can't wait to return.
