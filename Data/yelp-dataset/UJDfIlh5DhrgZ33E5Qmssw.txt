4	I discovered this Domino's Pizzas a while back tucked away inside a Sinclair/7-11 gas station and finally remembered to check it out. I placed an order online during the March Madness basketball games this weekend and was given a 14 min ETA. When I arrived at the store about 15 min later, my pizza was done as promised so I paid and was on my way back to continue watching basketball. I ordered a medium Honolulu Hawaiian pan pizza and the 1st thing I noticed when holding the box was that it was a little heavier than usual. When I opened the box I was pleased to find a pizza that was covered in a generous amount of toppings that put other pizza chains to shame. Well that explains why the box was so heavy! Overall the pizza was tasty although some parts of the crust could've used a few more min of cook time since it still tasted a little doughyThis location is smaller and inside a gas station so only carry-out is available, no deliveries. They are running a special where you can get menu items for $5.99 each (including medium 2 topping pizzas) as long as you order 2 or more from that list
4	I have been ordering from this location for years now and they have never disappointed. Although I couldn't give full 5 stars and that's not the store fault, its Dominos as a company. they would not allow a gift card purchase on the Dominos App. Still pizza is always tasty and delivery is always earlier than expected!
5	everyone that works at this location is so friendly and kind. when i come here i feel like I'm at home or visiting with friends. the pizza always makes me cry with joy because it is so delicious domino's is love domino's life
