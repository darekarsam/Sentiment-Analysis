5	I hadn't had much experience feeding wild birds before visiting this store so I needed a lot of advice on my first visit. Josh and Alicia, the owners, and Marina, were very welcoming and friendly. They set me up with a couple of different types of feeders and showed me which types of bird seed were appropriate for each one. They told me what kinds of birds I could expect to attract here at my north Scottsdale home. I've been thrilled to see Gila Woodpeckers, Gilded Flicker Woodpeckers, Thrashers, Cardinals, Cactus Wrens and several other types of birds. When I have a new visitor to my feeders that I don't recognize I can describe it to Josh and he instantly knows exactly which bird I'm talking about. His knowledge and enthusiasm make visits to the store fun and educational. The products are of the highest quality. We've even given the feeders as gifts to friends. Also, I feel like I'm feeding the birds something far more nutritional than what you'd find at the grocery store. This store has become one of my favorite places to shop.
5	I absolutely Love this store. The staff is amazing! Friendly and caring. I bought their round based wrought iron stand that you can make it as tall as you want and add arms, bowls, cylander feeder, trays and suet holders. The wind/rain storms in Scottsdale has not hindered it at all Plus no tools required! I also bought their window humming bird feeder as well as the yellow nyjer feeder which my house finches enjoy. The no mess bird seed is the way to go! All birds love it. The cylander cranberry nut mix is a hit The butter bark they sell is the thrashers favorite.
