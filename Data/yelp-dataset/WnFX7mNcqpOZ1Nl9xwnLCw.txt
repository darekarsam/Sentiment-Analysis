5	I work online, so my computer is my livelihood. When it wasn't working properly, it was affecting my income! I called My Biz Now and they fit me into their schedule very quickly. My laptop was diagnosed and fixed -- fast! Their business cards are great, and I've actually started looking into their credit card processing services as well. All around great business.Affordable with great customer service. Doesn't get much better than that.
5	I have used them numerous times - each time they were quick, professional, friendly, efficient, affordable, and far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend them!
5	When I was having computer problems I called Dewayne at My Biz Now and he came over within an hour.  He diagnosed the problem, gave me different options of what he could do, and his fee was way less than what I paid the geeks last year.  My husband has also had business cards printed and other print jobs done.  Not only were the cards super nice, but the the order came in really fast!
