5	I recently went on my first trip outside of the US.  I'd been planning on doing this for awhile, but suddenly had the travel bug bite hard and decided to make it happen.  Only one small problem: my traveling buddy and I have extremely difficult schedules in our work live to coordinate a time to vacation together.  We decided the only way this was going to work was for us to use a travel agency instead to coordinate all of the nitty gritty details.Enter Ride the Wave Travel.  David (our agent) was extremely useful in handling the search, booking and general preparation of the entire trip.  He suffered through many conference calls where we threw various date changes and reschedules his way with the best of positive attitudes.  He even had to change our hotel reservation at a somewhat last minute when one of the cities we were originally going to visit fell off the trip, forcing us to extend our stay in a different city.  It was so delightful not having to worry when plans changed.  If something needed to be adjusted, it was met, "all right, let's call David and let him know".The trip was a dream come true.  The hotel, selected by David, was fabulous and it was wonderful not having to worry about any of the paperwork and just enjoy myself.  I am a firm believer in properly detaching oneself during vacations, and I believe that step starts with the booking process.  I would definitely recommend Ride the Wave travel to anyone looking for a good travel agency.  I will be using them again this year for my next trip!
5	My husband and I usually limit our travel to the US so when we planned a trip to Italy and Norway we decided to go with a professional.  I searched online and Dave popped up.   The only recommendation I saw for Ride the Wave was the one posted before mine but it sounded great so I gave Dave a call. From the moment I met him on the phone, I knew right away we were in good hands.  Dave has an incredible attention to detail and I loved his great communication. He is available even after hours and responds quickly.   There were a lot of details in coordinating rental car, several different hotel reservations, train tickets, and multiple flights but Dave did a great job.  The hotels he chose were in perfect locations central to trains and also walking distance to the heart of the cities.  When i was without  printed rail passes, Dave contacted the hotel in Rome and send them over asap.  It was such a pleasure to know Dave had everything under control and the trip turned out to be the experience of a lifetime.  The only thing Dave can't take credit for is the beautiful weather we had in a country that is known for frequent rain!  There was nothing that could have made our vacation better than it was and Dave had a lot to do with that.  I highly recommend him to anyone looking to plan a trip.  You won't be disappointed!
5	My partner and I used the services of Ride The Wave Travel last May for our trip to Hawaii.  Dave Rodrigues and his associate gave us exceptional service and met our every need. They responded to every e-mail we sent without delay and frequently touched base with us to see if there was anything we needed.  The vacation was wonderful without a hitch.  Our accommodations were the best and we would not hesitate to use Ride The Wave again and would recommend it to our friends.                                 Richard McTevia and Alwyn Ogawa
