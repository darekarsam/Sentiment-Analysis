5	I recently discovered this store when I was looking for a place to replace the batteries in about 15 of my watches.  The other places I found charged $10 per watch and this one advertised $5 on the window.  I went in, was greeted right away and had five watches fixed within 10 minutes at $5 per watch.  I went back the next day with the next 10 and again great customer service and quick!While waiting I looked at the jewelry they sale and they have great prices.  My taste in clothing is a little different than what they have to offer but there was nothing wrong with it and again, the prices were reasonable. I will be going back for every jewelry repair I have and already handed out his business cards to my co-workers!
5	Aa
5	Ok...there's always a catch. LOL! It is $5 for the battery and $3 more for installation. Which actually is cheaper than everywhere else that charges you $10. The gentleman that helped me actually turned out to be very nice and quickly melted my irritation from the old bait and switch advertisement. LOL! He fixed a few easy costume jewelry issues for free since I was dropping off 9 watches for battery replacement. He offered to fix while I wait, but I had other errands, so I opted to come back.  He still said they would be done today. His store has a lot of other things to shop for while you are waiting if you chose to do so. So far this will be my go to gut for jewelry repair/watch battery replacement. Good price and fast service from a nice guy! Glad I came here. :)
5	All my watches were fixed with no problems or damage as I see on so many other places' reviews.  Again, this will be my go to guy for any jewelry repairs.
5	I read the reviews for this place and gave it a shot. The guy replaced the battery for my ESQ watch for $8. You can't beat that price!  Plus, I didn't wait longer than 15 minutes max!
