1	Everytime I visit there I wait at least 45 minutes before I make it through the waiting room door. Dr. Arnold has removed cancer from me twice. This last time I waited for 90 minutes and never made it through the door. Three other people who were there before me were still waiting. He gets high marks in skill. His office staff rates a zero for overbooking and rudeness. His bedside manner could use improving but his skill level outweighs that. His skill level does not excuse the length of time waiting. Doctor you are Fired!
4	First visit I saw the Doctor in 30 minutes.  The second visit was about an hour.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  All questions I had were answered.
5	My husband and I were new patients to Dr. Arnold. I knew from previous reviews here and other sites that his "bedside manner" was not chatty. We both found the office staff to be efficient and friendly. The doctor was to the point and took care of business. We did not wait long in waiting room or treatment room. Since we didn't really have any big issues I can't speak to how he would have handled us if we were facing life threatening issues. Will definitely go back for annual check ups and would recommend to friends and family...already have.
5	Dr Arnold is a no-nonsense professional. His staff are always friendly and courteous. I would highly recommend him.
4	Visited this office some years back, so I'm going on a sketchy memory.  Had a skin bump that wasn't going away.  Arnold applied a cold laser to remove it.  Hasn't returned, so I'm pleased with the outcome.  As far as wait times, staff courtesy, etc. etc. nothing sticks out in my mind, so it must have been "business as usual" in that respect.  I do remember Arnold being a very straightforward, Mr. Spock kinda guy, which might appeal to some but not others.
