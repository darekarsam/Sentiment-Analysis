5	Great company to work with and very competitively priced. I hired them for my April wedding. This is a company that provides great customer service. Everyone loved the open photo station. The pictures were great. We love that we have this fantastic pictorial of a guest book! We are so happy we hired them and would highly recommend them!
5	I hired Digital Expressions for my daughters Bat Mitzvah.  Right from the start, Laura was helpful, accommodating and easy to work with.  She had great ideas and was willing to try anything that I suggested.I bought a few hundred picture frames and she brought an extra person to our event for a small fee.  She also helped us pick 5 Green Screen backgrounds with my daughters Bat Mitzvah logo.  At the Bat Mitzvah, they brought great props and were a lot of fun with my guests.In short, I was very pleased with everything about Digital Expressions and would use them again without hesitation.
5	Love them! I just recently used them for our wedding & everyone had a blast with it! Laura is so sweet & helpful!  One of my bridesmaids is getting married in Oct and after seeing what good of a job they did she decided that she wanted a photo booth too! Best price around for a photo booth as well, which is great considering how much everything else for weddings cost. Def. recommend!
