5	I have been bringing my dogs to Dr. Brinkmann since my dog was blinded by another ophthalmologist here in town. Dr. B was able to save her eye from being removed  however her sight could not be restored because the damage caused by the first doctor(?) was too great. I take my dogs every 6 months to see him and his wonderful staff. Dr. B is the most experienced eye doctor for animals in Las Vegas and I recommend him highly.
5	Dr and staff are amazing! You can really tell this is their passion. I always have to bring my two small children with me, and the staff always has coloring books, crayons, and snacks to keep them occupied. Thanks for taking care of my four legged furry baby ;)
5	Dr. Brinkmann was recommended to me by so many and they were absolutely right!  He and his staff are amazing!
5	Dr. Michael Brinkmann was recommended to us, because our Amigo has cataracts and glaucoma.We were thrilled with the attention Dr. Brinkmann and his tech staff, Jean and Michele gave to Amigo. It was heartwarming to see them interact with our little guy. They are so devoted to helping your pet.No matter how busy Dr. Brinkmann may be, your appointment has all his attention. We never felt rushed. We always leave completely satisfied.Every pet parent we met there had only the most highest compliments and respect for the doctor and his staff, as do we and our Amigo!
5	Dr. Brinkmann was soooo great! We had been told by Banfield that our shitzu might lose his eye (he had a bad ulcer). I went for a second opinion at South Valley Animal Hospital and they recommended Dr. Brinkmann. He is so knowledgeable and you can tell he wants to help you with price and isn't trying to get you to spend on unnecessary treatments. He saved my doggies eye and he is back to his normal self. Please go directly to this vet for any eye problems. You will be happy you did!Thanks to Dr. Brinkmann and his friendly & caring staff!!
