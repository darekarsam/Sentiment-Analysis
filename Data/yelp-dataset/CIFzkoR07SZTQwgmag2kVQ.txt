4	We had a late lunch at the new Grape Wine Bistro this week and were very pleased about the entire experience. The menu, which is evolving, consists of interesting dishes, well prepared and presented. We split a burger which was on the daily special menu. It was delicious - moist and full of flavor. We also appreciated the staff and found them to be responsive and friendly.  The new manager, Ryan Rodrigues, made a point of greeting us on arrival and asking us after the meal about the food and service. We look forward to experiencing new menu choices as they are added.Marc and Kristin Bailes
5	I tried Grape Wine Bistro today for happy hour and was very impressed. We were greeted promptly by a friendly waiter and took a seat at the bar. He immediately took our drink order and I was enjoying a glass of wine within 2 minutes! The wine selection was unique and they also offer a full bar.  Since we were meeting a friend for dinner we just ordered the cheese plate as a snack. They had 10+ cheeses to choose from along with 4 Italian meats. The plate came with marcona almonds, grapes, apple slices, crackers, baguette toasts and tasty apricot preserves. We chose a rosemary asiago which was amazing along with manchengo and sopressata which is always a good idea. I will definitely go back for dinner and recommend it to friends! P.S. They have brunch on Saturdays and Sundays with $1 mimosas and bloody Mary's!
5	This restaurant checks all the boxes ... I wouldn't change a thing and I'd go back in a heart beat! Food is perfect, atmosphere is perfect, service was beyond perfect! Loved, loved, loved it!
