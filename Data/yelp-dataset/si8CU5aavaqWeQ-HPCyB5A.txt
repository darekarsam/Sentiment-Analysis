5	My wife and I had dinner there this past Saturday.  The place issued a Wagjag coupon, and we were anxious to use it.We were NOT disappointed.  My wife had the orange chicken, which was delicious.  I had the hot and sour soup (really good) and the pad thai.  The pad thai is amazing!We also had some delicious spring rolls with dipping sauce.We definitely intend to go back.  The service was also excellent.Not a lot of customers yet, though judging by the number of people who just got takeout while we were there, it appears to be getting more and more popular.
4	Definitely a good place for some viet/thai food. Very friendly staff. I've ordered from here many times and the food is always consisent and yummy. Reasonable prices. I've ordered pad thai, orange chicken, thai basil, pho and shanghai noodles. All delicious.
5	Very good Asian cuisine. I go every week or so and they never fail to deliver.Consistently good and affordable food, together with friendly service make this place a rare find. I recommend it with all my heart.Don't forget to get some ice cubes if you're getting the Tom Yum Goong soup (v.v.v. spicy).
