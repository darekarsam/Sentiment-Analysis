4	George Henderson, the Owner and Operator of Henderson Appliance Installation, LLC is professional installer of various kinds of kitchen appliances.  He is very thorough.  He is very efficient.  He is very much customer oriented.  He does represent great value.  The fact that he even vacuumed up after himself shows that he has pride in his workmanship.I hired George to remove my old Over-The-Hood Microwave, and install the new one that I had purchased.  He did a good job.  He was well prepared.  He was prompt.  I will definitely recommend him to others as appropriate.
5	George is awesome. Honest on time and does a great job! He has done 3 - 4 jobs for me and there is no one better!
5	George exceeded my expectations on new washer and dryer installation. It was not easy to move new appliances into the laundry room because the door width was uneven but he kept his word on installing without getting any scratches on them. He made sure they are working and cleaned up well after his job. I would definitely seek his services in the future and recommend him to others. Last but not the least - his fees are very competitive.
