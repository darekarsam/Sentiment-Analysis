3	Ahhhh, TV watching when you aren't at home with your myriad of cable choices.  CTV (Canadian) does a good job of bringing me my favorites while on the road, thank you!  I know my DVR is working overtime during my absence, but its nice to catch shows live once in a while.  The nicest thing is that the commercials aren't as rampant as they are in the US.  Seriously, you can actually make it 10 minutes or more WITHOUT a commercial....whooo hooooo!  Yes, I'm the one who DVRs my favs and then fast forwards through the commercials with glee.  I can watch an hour long program in about 35-40 min!  I call it speed TV.Today's local headline, "Moose Stuck in Ice" - so what do you do, eh?  Well, you grab a rope and attach it to the moose's antlers and drag him out with your snowmobile...noooo problem, eh?  The problem is how do we get our rope back, eh??     :)What I am finding is that the anchors ask really pointed questions when speaking with government officials, they don't gloss over the ever-growing gang problems in the country and all seem to have perfect skin and nicely coiffed hair (thank you make-up and hair folks).
1	Huge disappointment. Good-bye CTV, hello Global. You are an insult to the anglo community and don't even have the decency to pull the ads nor reply to any comments.
