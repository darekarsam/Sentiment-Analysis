4	Yes this is yet another sushi place, but hey I never get tired of trying new places like this.  It had a really nice, casual feel to it.  A sushi place that's no frills is kind of rare, so I was looking forward to seeing how good it was.  I was not disappointed, everything was up to par with many of the other places I've been to.  The tempura shrimp was excellent, and dumplings were just the best.  The service was very friendly too.  Everyone seemed to be in a good mood, and I even struck up a conversation with the sushi chef while he was making my order.  It was a really fun place and the food was relatively cheap.
4	Went here for a birthday lunch last week and it was soo good! Let's just say, I never get tired of trying new places.  It had a really nice, casual feel to it.   It was relatively cheap and the service was fast. I would definitely recommend going here!
3	Wife does not eat anything out of the ocean, which limits our restaurant excursions when together.  But I am OK with sushi and Yotto is one of the better ones in the Charlotte area.  Sushi is their specialty.It has a local flavor, similar to what you find in Japan.  Small, clean, family-run, fresh fish and reasonable prices.  Food is served with pride, even with the no-family wait staff.  They like this place and you will, too.In the Quail Hollow Harris Teeter shopping center.
