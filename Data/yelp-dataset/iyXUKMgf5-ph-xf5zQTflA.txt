5	Very good food and fantastic service.  Great place to watch a game with lots of TVs.
4	This is a large upscale sports bar in a large upscale shopping plaza. We only had one beer here but noticed that the service was good, the prices are fair, and I liked the overall atmosphere - reminded me of Zipps in Scottsdale. FYI - Shocktop is only $3.50.
3	Good food, good service. I loved the chicken colorado. Management seems to be interested in how to customers feel which is always a good sign.
1	Closed down, it's the Char bar no 7 (or the char no 7 bar ) now.
4	Unfortunately, the most I've been here is during this football season.  Gets pretty crowded for the games, but a good crowd. Lots of tvs and seating.  The bartenders are really cool and very good about keeping your glasses filled.  Jason (bartender) is a huge Steelers fan so he makes watching the games fun. I usually get the wings and they are great about cooking mine longer to get them extra crispy.
