1	I went there to have a tire checked because it had a slow leak. After a thirty minute wait, they said there was no problem with the tire and that the aluminum wheel was leaking. They put a sealant on the inside of the rim and advised that it was a temporary fix and would leak again in the future. A day later I still had a leak. I took the car to another garage and they found a small hole in my tire within 5 minutes! Oh and they charged half of what NTB did. Take your car somewhere else!
5	I love NTB. They didn't have any rims, but once we got a rim, they fixed up my car on New Year's Eve and got us back on the road earlier than they said they would. These guys were SO nice too! They along with Spitz Auto saved our weekend. If not for them, I would have not gotten to see my family. Thanks NTB!!!
