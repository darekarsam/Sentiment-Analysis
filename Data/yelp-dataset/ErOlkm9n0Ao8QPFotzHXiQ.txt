1	Absolutely baffled by the rude attitude and lack of product knowledge I experienced by a team member at this location. Won't see me back at this location, not worth the headache!
3	Helpful staff! Very Helpful!
1	Ok, so normally this place is great but today I had an experience that was absolutely awful. Who ever the short haired lady that worked at 2:30 pm on 08/31/2014 needs to be fired. I walked in grabbed a couple Celsius drinks went to check out and she completely skipped over me and helped the gentleman who should've been behind us. I want to mention he paid with a  credit card. When we were next I asked my husband if he had cash since it was such a small transaction and he said no....GET THIS.....all of the sudden her credit card machine went down and since we didn't have cash she refused us the sale....not sure what her deal was seeing as how we were in there a whopping 30 sec and didn't talk to her at all. Oh well, on to the vitamin shoppe
4	So it was end of lunch hour on a Tuesday.  I was walking in directly behind a guy.  He was greeted by a gal and assisted immediately.  There was someone checking out as well.  I was there for a Quest bar and BAM a Huge selection was right there - i was happy.  Before I could pick one up Grant greeted me from the checkout and asked if he could help.  On checkout I was offered a sample - which I glady accepted and was given info on it.  Pleasant and attentive experience.   I'll be back.
