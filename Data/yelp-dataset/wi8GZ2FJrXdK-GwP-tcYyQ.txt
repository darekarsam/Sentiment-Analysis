5	I've had a handful of amazing massages with Stefania.  She has the perfect touch; not too strong and not too soft (but leaning a little towards the stronger side).  Her massages are very relaxing, and I've fallen asleep every time.  Her rate is super affordable for first-time massages - $40 for 1 hour!!!  She's located on Penn Avenue, close to the Target store.  She's a really cool girl to talk to as well, and I highly recommend giving her a try!
4	Had a great massage! The studio off Penn Avenue was a bit hard to find, but pleasantly surprised once I found it. Very clean, calming space. Stefania was very thorough for my massage. She spoke to me before to learn exactly what I wanted for concentration areas. I was surprised she went over the hour I paid for, most massages I have ever got ended on the minute! I plan to be back soon.
