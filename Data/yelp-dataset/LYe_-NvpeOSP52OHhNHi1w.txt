5	A great place with reasonable prices, good turnaround times & quality cleaning. Plus they have a drive-through to pick up your clothes, and the staff is very friendly and remembers me by name :).
5	Prices are reasonable but I'll be coming back because the service is excellent. Picked up a pair of jeans that needed the zipper fixed not twenty minutes ago and the lady who's shift had just started was sweet as can be! Very genuine!
