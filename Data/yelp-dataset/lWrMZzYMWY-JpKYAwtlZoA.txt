1	An  interracial couple I know recently went too Charley's and was treated very offensively by the staff. SHame on Charley's -- this is 2012. Even if it were 1960, all people of all skin colors must be treated with respect. My recommendation: boycott Charley's steakhouse. A business that practices racism does not deserve to be in business at all.
1	This was a brightly lit place with a trailer feel that had table clothes on tables that filled a plain rectangular single room.  There was plenty of help running around ignoring the four of us for a bit and then the excitement started when we ordered and was told how many things they did not have like bacon, cheddar cheese and the like.  It was a "steak place" and they proved it by charging between $25 and $37.  We had a bad enough feeling about the place and didn't chance that by just ordering hamburgers and fries and with a drink each that came to $31.  Flavor probably would have been extra.  Go anywhere also.
1	If I could give a ZERO, I would.  We had the prime rib last night and it tasted awful!  In fact, it tasted old.  The food is definitely not worth the money.  The only thing good about the experience was the service.  I was with someone that has been going to this restaurant over 30 years and they say they have never tasted such bad food from this place...yes, even their food tasted just average or old.  Perhaps quality control isn't what it used to be?  I think this will be the last time for me.
