4	Carne Asada fries! Open 24hrs and never too packed! Minus 1 star cause they got no Mexican Cokes!
3	Never crowded, service is quick and efficient. Food is typical Roberto's. Love their enchaladas and rellanos.
1	Says it's 24 hours open. It's 1:31AM and it's fuckin closed!!!
4	Service is quick and the food is delicious. I frequent this place for lunch. The burritos tend to be a little on the sloppy side, but that's just because they're incredibly juicy and extremely packed inside, so I'm certainly not complaining about it.Biggest tip: There is a small cart on the back wall with many side items that you can place into provided baggies. I *highly* recommend the spicy carrots. No extra charge!
5	Awesome service! Always smiling. Clean place and as always, delicious food at really good prices.. Couldn't think of a better spot for football game food or late night munchies
5	Fantastic and fast service. The staff are very friendly at this location. Now that wet live back in this area, this will be out main location. My favorite part at this location during this visit was the fresh cucumbers on the salsa bar. My boys live the carne asada burritos and the bacon and egg breakfast burrito. Personally, I am a #4 all the way, no matter the location, 2 shredded beef tacos with rice and beans...YUMMY!
