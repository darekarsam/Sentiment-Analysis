5	Brought my PS3 in with a YLOD and blinking red light. Fixed in a day. Jose has all the equipment necessary to it for cheap. $30 out the door.  Fast, proffesional and cheap. Highly recommended
5	Brought my laptop in with a registry virus issue to Halcon, which is run out of the back of the owner's house, and he had it fixed and back in working order within 24 hours. And he did it for dirt cheap and with a 90-day warranty. Highly recommended.
5	Halcon computer repair has been my go to computer guy for at least a couple of years, he always has time to fix things, flat 30 bucks to clean up, free diagnostics, and no charge if he can't do the repair.   Gets rid of viruses, changes out hard drives and other computer words that you tech people know.  I am so computer illiterate,  that I love the ease that I can impress my husband when I say, " don't stress babe, I got a guy that will handle that..." #savestheday
