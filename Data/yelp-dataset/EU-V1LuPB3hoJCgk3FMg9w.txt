5	I attended a wedding in Pittsburgh and received great service from this company.  They handled limos, sedans and buses for the wedding.  We were lucky because the bride arranged for shuttles for the out of town guests.  We got a ride to church, then reception and then back to hotel.  The service was outstanding.  Bus was clean and driver was very accomodating.  we left something on bus and he personally delivered it to our hotel!
2	Not worth your money.  Poor service, worn interior, A/C was non-functional, THE CD PLAYER DIDN'T WORK, AND THERE WAS NO AUXILIARY JACK.They get two start because they managed to get us from Point A to Point B without making us fear for our lives.
