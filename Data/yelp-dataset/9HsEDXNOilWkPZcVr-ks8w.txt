2	Esha's is not the best takeaway shop I have expereinced in Edinburgh, thats for sure.  Esha's is situated in the centre of the busy and bustling Nicolson Street, just a short walk from the University and so it is a handy place for students to pop into to buy their dinner on their home from classes, however, Esha's is not the best takeaway shop on Nicolson street to go into. Esha's menu is incredibly diverse, offering dishes such as pizzas, burgers, curries and baked potatoes. I came to Esha's for dinner several months ago with a friend to buy a pizza and we had the ham and mushroom which was absolutely nothing to rave about. The mushrooms were really soft and appeared to have dissolved into the topping mixture, and the pizza base was quite soggy and burnt in places - not nice. My friend also ordered a portion of chips which were a far cry from the traditional Scottish chips we were expecting - these looked as though they had come from a frozen packet, and not a good one at that. The prices are very reasonable and a 15% student discount is available. You are able to order your meals online at Esha's website and they also offer a home delivery service which is convenient.   The staff are friendly, and perhaps some of their other dishes are tastier than the pizza which I had.
