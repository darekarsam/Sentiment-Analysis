5	This is an excellent spot for mailing and packing needs.  We've been very pleased with the service.  They are very efficient, so even when there is a wait, it's never long.  Also, we have had them pack many items for us.  None of them have arrived at their destination damaged in any way.  Very friendly service, and reasonable prices for packing items.
5	I have passed this place many times. I stopped by kne day to mail a package while my car was being serviced. This place is way cheaper than where I usually go. The nice lady behind the counter suggested  different packaging that cut the price in half. In the end i paid less than half at the other business that I  usually go to. The other place I  frequent often NEVER have suggested cheaper alternatives to sending my packages. My package arrived at its destination sooner than I had expected.  This place definitely have my business for now on. What a great find. Thanks! !!
