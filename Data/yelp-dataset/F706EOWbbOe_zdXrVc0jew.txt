3	Was looking for something a little more healthy than Carl's Jr or Burger King and didn't feel like spending an arm and a leg for the other restaurants in the airport so I decided to eat here. Food was good and they have a nice selection. I went with one of their grilled mozz and chicken sandwich and it wasn't too bad. I agree with the other reviewer that service is on the slow side and they didn't seem to know who was first in line since they helped someone who cut in front of me and even watched him do it LOL. All in all I had a good and healthier-side sandwich so it worked out. A-OK pretty much sums it up here.
2	The low rate is primarily for the service. 4 employees wandering around behind the counter yawning while acting like the customer (me, being the only customer in sight) is interrupting them. Every table top was dirty, no customers sitting down, just empty dirty tables. The food was average, but slightly better than the usual airport meal.
1	The food was lousy.  The cheese pizza was greasy and bland.  It reminded me of pizza at the cafeteria when I was in college.  The lime chicken sandwich that my wife ordered was also less than stellar.  The service was slow, and they already had run out of several sandwiches on the menu, even though we ordered around 1pm.
1	The tables are disgusting.  Nobody cleans them even though it is still early in the day.  For $10 I got two pieces of day old bread, a slice of cheese, a slice of tomato, and basil.  The workers don't speak English so it is very difficult to order.  Everything is overpriced.  They don't deserve to call themselves a restaurant when they take advantage of tourists who don't know any better.
