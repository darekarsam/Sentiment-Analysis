2	I wanted to like this hotel.  Located overlooking the town hall, it is right in the middle of the market.  Unfortunately this means the room is incredibly loud.  No air conditioning and no fans mean the room windows have to be opened so that the light rail service that goes by every minute and the crowded plaza stream noise into the room.Furnishings are very dated, and the non-smoking room smells like smoke.  Pleas to move an exhausted international traveler to the back of the hotel fell on deaf ears.Not recommended.
