4	Visiting our son and fiance we had a fantastic dinner & experience at Dann Sushi.  All 4 of us agree that sushi quality & presentation was top notch and an great value.  Especially enjoyed the miso soup (served nice and hot!) Tataki & tempura shrimp was best we've ever had!  Service was so very helpful & warm with many smiles.  We will return for sure!
