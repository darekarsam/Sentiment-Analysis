2	Not my style. A little dingy and quite dirty. Try not to use the toilets. If you must seek professional help afterwards. Strange crowd.
3	I was looking for a place to get a coffee and do some work on my laptop, and was pleasantly surprised by this place next to Mont Royal Metro.I thought it was going to be pretty seedy, given it's open 24 hours, but it was clean and bright inside. The service was cheerful and friendly, and the coffee (I just had their filter coffee) was fine.The internet is really fast - probably the fastest free wifi I've had in Montreal (make sure you connect to the "5 Ghz" version of their wifi networks - they've got two).
2	My first impression of this place was not so great. It it gloomy, dirty (I had to wipe the window sill before putting my backpack on it). It smells, the waitresses were unprofessional (but nice!), and lots of equipments were not working properly. The food doesn't look fresh, it might even be microwaved. I had a croissant and a mango smoothie. I can't say it was horrible, but I ate to fill my stomach, not for the taste. I felt bad for two French tourists who apparently love Montreal. They might like the city less after this. The only advantage is how close it is to the Mont-Royal metro station. Oh and there is wifi.
2	Oh, this place is terrible! We needed a caffeine fix and a place to rest our tired dogs, so we stopped by this joint. The coffee is not bad, however everything else about this place needs improvement. The tables are so dirty. and a few of them are wobbly too. There was a strong smell of chlorine by the bathrooms, which I suppose is not bad -- it means they at least clean the bathroom. They have wifi, but it is so weak and spotty, they might as well not say they have it.
