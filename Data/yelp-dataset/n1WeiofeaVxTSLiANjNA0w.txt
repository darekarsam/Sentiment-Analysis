3	Called them when my car overheated about 20 miles from my house.  AAA sent these guys.  I have no complaints- although the truck ride home was kinda stinky (but I don't expect much from work trucks) and the driver was SILENT!  Didn't even attempt small talk- just turned up his country station for the 20 minute drive.
5	Rescued my 1962 Skylark Convertible, and took excellent car and concern for it. Rick (the tow truck driver) was great! Glad to find a quick, courteous, tow company....Since I probably will be needed their services quite a bit with this beauty! Thanks Guys!
3	My insurance company chose these guys based on my location via the roadside assistance service.Driver, Anthony, was pleasant and reasonably professional. But since I had to ride with him to my destination, I had to listen to chatter about a non-tipping customer from another driver on the radio which I found completely unprofessional. And other mundane convo which should have been kept to when the two were alone. People who are getting their vehicles towed are doing so because something shitty happened to their rides so I think the drivers need to be a little more sensitive to this. Also, if a customer, like me who hardly ever carries cash, doesn't tip, maybe the drivers should consider that it's not necessarily based on their service but that the situation may have been unexpected. (Note: I DID tip my driver)Paperwork and tie down of vehicle was quick and efficient and driver arrived at time estimated.I would use them again if it was my same driver.
