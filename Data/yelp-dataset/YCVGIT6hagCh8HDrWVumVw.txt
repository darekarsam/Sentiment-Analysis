4	I like this place more than I like most other true dollar stores (stores where everything is actually a dollar).  They have a weirdly large pet selection, with brand name goods for dogs, cats, and even gerbils and birds.  I kept my dog tick free this summer for a dollar--can't beat that.
5	Might Dollar makes me holler. OMG all kinds of crap in a good way. You know when you need certain party crap and it is so expensive in party stores? Well, they have napkins, plates, tablecloths, sections for wedding and baby showers. All that nonsense that you need sometimes. They also had cleaning supplies and a whole aisle of crafting stuff. I was really shocked. Fifteen dollars later, I'm leaving. My best find was note cards from Hallmark, with a saute pan that read: What's Cookin? Need I say more?
3	As of Jan. 2012, they're closed, by the way, this isn't in Ballantyne, it's in Pineville.
