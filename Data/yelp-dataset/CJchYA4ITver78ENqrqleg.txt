5	I wouldn't think that having to get your car fixed would be such a nice experience, but it was. Everyone was so nice here, and they finished the job fast, did a great job, AND cleaned the vehicle so well... I thought it would be a basic wash/vacuum job, but the car looked detailed. I would definitely recommend them to everyone!
5	If you are ever in need of collision repair this is the best place to go!! I am so happy I chose Sterling. The people are very friendly and the best part is they are punctual!! It's amazing how much they value customer service here. They called me every day to let me know about the progress of the repair and made me feel very secure. I truly felt that my car was in good hands. They even repaired it several days before my car was expected to be done! The quality of the repair was excellent also. I felt as if I just bought a new car with how well they repaired it. The color match was perfect too. But what sets Sterling apart, I would say, is their punctuality and dedication to customer service! I would strongly recommend Sterling to everyone! Thank you all at Sterling again for the wonderful experience!!
1	What a scam.  They low balled the quote said it would take 6 days to fix car. Once I gave them the okay.  They doubled the price of quote and it took 3 weeks to fix car.  I   Would highly recommend you to use another company.
5	My first time needing auto body work in Las Vegas. They were terrific. Fast, friendly, efficient and professional. I strongly recommend them for any auto body repair.
