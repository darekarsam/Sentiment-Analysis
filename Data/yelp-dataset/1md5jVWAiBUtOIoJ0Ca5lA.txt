1	My partner and I took the birth prepping course for our first child only to be told by our midwife later that we should not have done some of the exercises we were instructed to do in class.  I, individually, attended a prenatal yoga class.  The instructor proceeded to lead a class for myself and one other student that was filled 75% with poses contra-indicated to the issues I was facing in my pregnancy (which I had told the instructor about).  As such, I paid for a full class but spent the bulk of it sitting patiently waiting for the next instruction.   I will absolutely not recommend this place to anyone I know who is pregnant.
5	I loved going to the prenatal yoga classes. I feel the instructors were great and worked to address any needs I had. I feel that by doing yoga at shining light prenatal it empowered me as well as gave me the tools to have a natural birth.
