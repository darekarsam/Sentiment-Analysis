5	We switched from a national brand monitoring to Alain when upgrading from land-line to cell communications in 2010.  He was great, system worked great.  Last month I had a backup battery fail, Alain told me what to buy, how to install it and how to reset the system to know there was a new battery.  He did this consultation for free to help me as a customer rather than charge for a service call.  Alain's good, experiences and customer focused.  Top notch.
5	I have been very happy with Bear 2.  This is a small locally owned security business, that takes pride in their work and has a personal interest in taking care of their customers unlike the big businesses.  I highly recommend them not only are they local but also right in line with the big security companies in price.
5	Alain Bertout with Bear 2 Protection is extremely knowledgeable and he cares about educating his clients on being properly protected. I would strongly suggest encourage anyone to use Alain Bertout with Bear 2 Protection for any of your Home or Commercial Security needs, WHY?
