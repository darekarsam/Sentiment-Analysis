4	I don't come here that often because it is so expensive, but I do love Einstein Bros.  There's a reason they're so pricey and it's because of the quality of their food.  I've gone in for a few of their bagels with cream cheese (Everything, Potato, Plain, and Sesame are all good) and some of their sandwiches (average) as well as their fantastic coffee.  Their autumn roast is my favorite, though the neighborhood blend is nice during the rest of the year.  They also do a halfway decent mocha/latte.Give Einstein Bros. a try and you will most likely find something you enjoy.
4	I have always had good customer service, fresh food and tasty coffee. I would definitely recommend this location. I have never experienced any problems here.
3	The bagels and coffee are always tasty, but I have been to this particular Einstein's four times in the last month and each time the tables have been dirty and my order has been wrong. I worked in food service for years and understand that some things slip during a rush, but when the line consists of one person and there are five staff members standing around, the tables should be wiped down and the coffee pots shouldn't be empty.
