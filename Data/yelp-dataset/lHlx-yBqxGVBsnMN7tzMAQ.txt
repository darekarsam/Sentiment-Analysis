4	I just got bit by the golf bug, AGAIN.  I have been out of the sport for some 12 yrs now and really had no intention of ever playing again.  My gf had begged me to start playing again but I really did not want to.  To make a long story very short, I went golfing on a bet to get a friend to go hunting with me and then found myself in the market for clubs and my gf thinks my friend rates higher than she does....another story for another time...love you honey.  Anyway, my friend, ya the same one, told me about Golfsmith.  I really went in looking to just pick up a used set of clubs, nothing fancy and nothing expensive.  I walked around the store for a while looking at the various $600 + sets...ouch!  Maybe for you, but not for me.  Finally to started looking at the complete sets they have in the front of the store.  An associate named Ryan approached me and asked what I was looking for, yada yada yada.  I told hime the situation and he promptly directed to the complete sets that I was looking at.  He was very helpful and understood eveything I was asking.  He didn't try to push the expensive clubs on me and he told me that if I did stay with it I could build on the set, ie buy a better driver, different irons, etc.   He also stated that by the time I bought all of the used clubs, the bag and everything I would just be at the same price as the new sets. Sounded good so I bought a set of Lynx clubs (Driver, 3 wood, hybrid 3 and 4 wood, 5 to 9 iron, PW, SW, putter,  "kick stand" bag, head covers and dust cover) for $259 ($150 I think, off regular price).  I also received a free 30 minute free swing diagnosis, that guy has no idea whats in store for him.  All in all I liked the place and they seemd very reasonible in the price department and were very helpful.
