5	As a realtor, I depend on constant communication and follow through for my buyers. When my buyers chose Mike Hengy, the process was very smooth!  Mike found solutions and closed the loan on time !  All parties were very happy! I would recommend Mike again!
5	Mike was great to work with in getting the best deal on a home loan! Going into the loan process, we really had no idea what we were doing. Mike was so patient with us, walking us through step by step - no matter the time or day. I would definitely recommend anyone and everyone to go through him if they want a smooth loan process where he will do everything in his power to make it fit your needs and get everything processed as quickly as you need.
5	Mike worked hard to get us the best rate out there.  He took all our calls and answered all our questions.  I would recommend him!
