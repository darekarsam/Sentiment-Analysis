3	Beer World sounds alot more fun than it really is. It's really just a store with many beers,  but not as good a selection as you would find at your local Bev Mo. It's been a while since I went there, so maybe they have more beers on hand now. Anyway, a decent memory of one of the most alcohol -soaked trips I've ever been on.
4	We support and shop locally owned and operated businesses. Locally owned and operated beer stores just happen to be a favorite!  Dave knows his beer and has some nice high % beers to choose from!
5	This place is awesome! These guys are friendly and know their stuff. They have a lot of great beers on hand and make great recommendations. Plus, they have a drive-thru and a cat for a mascot! How cool is that?
5	This place is great-better prices than large boxstores.  Sure, the selection is not as extensive but more than enough to choose from.  Dave is entertaining and knowledgable.  And the diverse clientele-could be a reality show!  My favorite stop on way home from work.
5	We found this place by accident. We were heading to a BBQ and needed to grab some beer. The owner greeted us immediately & was super friendly. He took plenty of time to tell us about his selection and offered up some great recommendations. You can make your own 6packs and the price is around 8.50 - This is always a plus as its nice to try new flavors but not have to purchase an entire 6 pack. Great selection and awesome customer service, A+ in my book! Plus, I really like supporting a local small business.
