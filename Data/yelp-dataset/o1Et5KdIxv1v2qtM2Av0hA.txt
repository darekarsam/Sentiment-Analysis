2	The ice cream here kind of sucks, which pains me to say because I love ice cream.  The place has "dairy" in the name, you would think the dairy products would be good.  Well I'll be fair and say that maybe it was just the flavor I got that wasn't the best, but I don't know.  Anyway the place itself is basically one of those stands where you walk up to the window to order which is pretty convenient.  I haven't tried their grill food yet, so maybe that will change my mind about this place.  I kind of doubt it though.
4	I agree about the ice cream, and I never get it here. But....their hot dogs are soo good. The chili makes them. They make their chili homemade daily and it is amazing. They have beef or mixed hot dogs. Of course there are hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, and other grill type foods, but the hot dogs are just so darn good I've never tried anything else. They are a little slow so I always call mine in ahead. This is a stand type place but they do have a couple of tables set up outside.Go get a hot dog!
2	Everything was just mediocre. I've had 100 times better of just the milkshake and hotdog alone. Its great for a quick snack though. I wasn't even close to impressed, well the location is great for me.
2	These hot dogs have nothing on Mojo's Famous Hot Dogs on Statesville Rd. And they have a Hot Dog Cart.
