5	very professional. you get your bang for you buck!
5	I've had my hair colored and Brazilian blow outs by her for years and I absolutely love it.   I haven't been anywhere else since I found her.   She is the best yet.
5	I can't rave more about Liz!  I'm so lucky to have found her!  Her skills are absolutely AMAZING!  There is no pressure, she understood the look I was going for, and very accommodating to my last minute changes (sorry about that Liz).  Totally recommend her for any and every look!
