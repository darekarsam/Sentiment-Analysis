4	Are you a dude that needs a haircut? Then go here and ask for Lazar. He's the owner, he's good, he's quick, he's friendly and the basic cut is $14. Been going for a year or so and haven't had a bad experience yet.
5	Lazar is the best. I tried nearly all the barbers in the area. He's quick, consistent, and great at fading a close cut.
4	Great service .
