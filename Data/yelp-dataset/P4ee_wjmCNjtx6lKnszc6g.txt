3	Living in the Philadelphia area we became spoiled by the pediatricians available and the speedy efficiency by which they operate their practices. Dilworth Pediatrics has reasonable hours and an appropriate number of physicians, but they are SO SLOW! Each visit we've been to has taken two or more hours to be seen!!! That is completely unacceptable, especially if you're holding a sick, screaming child who needs to get home to bed. Once you're finally seen the care is good, helpful, and the doctors have a decent bedside manner.
5	First--further to the review from Erin A. I've had to wait sometimes at this practice but I would not describe it as 'slow.' And I've never had to wait 2-3 hours. If you want speed, move back to Philadelphia, America's worst city.We've always had tremendous care at Dilworth Pediatrics.
