5	First time I came in here 3 years ago, they greeted me as I walked in. I have been treated exactly the same for the same 3 years. I am a regular and I always have one specific person cut my hair  hair and it's great to have conversation with the hair stylist. I normally show/ let them know what I want for my hair and they give me their input and what would be the best for your hair... regarding it's health and what you should/could do. You don't HAVE to make an appointment, but preferrably you should. Mainly cause they don't want you to wait too long.
5	My whole family probably get their hair cut here. Wendy is the person you need to look for. Any hair style, combover, punky, spikey, long hair, whatsoever. She does all of them. She's been my hair dresser for the past 7 years till now. Never let anyone touch my hair. Guaranteed trusted and will recommend to everyone!!! Bring a picture too and she can do it. Done it to my son and now he has combovers lol really chill place and friendly atmosphere. Walk-in is welcome too. A+!!!
5	Been coming here for 5+ years now. I always have Wendy cut my hair. She is great! I trust her as a hairstylist to do whatever she wants, and she never disappoints. I moved to California almost a year ago, and drove out to Vegas just to get a haircut from her. Friends that I have recommended also only go to her now. I have had my hair highlighted by her as well in the past and it came out great.
5	I am a regular here.the staff are very accommodating with appointments including walk in appointments. The prices are reasonable and the head massage during shampooing is far better than any regular salon.
