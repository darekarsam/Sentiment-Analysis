5	This is best record shop I've been to while in Montreal. The selection of music definitely fits the bill of indie and interesting. They even had a good selection of Numero Group albums, the incredible soul and funk label out of Chicago.  As other reviewers have pointed out, you can get tickets to pretty much any indie show in the city here at face value. They'll charge you a slight fee for paying with credit, but it's still the cheapest place to stock up on tickets. The guys who work here are super helpful and didn't mind one bit that we didn't French.  I wished I lived closer so I could visit more often. Highly recommended.
