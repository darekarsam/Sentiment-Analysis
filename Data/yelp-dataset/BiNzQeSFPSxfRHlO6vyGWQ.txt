4	Friendly guys who took great care of my Honda Element for me.  They recommended the full battery of Honda recommend service - but did it for $200 less than the dealership.  Great that's it's right next to the train station so you can get a ride to do something while they're doing the work.  I appreciate the low cost of the service and part of it is in a low-cost facility - so the waiting area isn't somewhere I'd really want to spend a couple hours - that's the only thing keeping it from a 5 star rating!
4	Trustworthy and friendly crew here. I've serviced both of our Hondas here and am always confident I'm not being overcharged or pushed into repairs that aren't needed.Highly recommended!
5	I agree with everything Neil stated. They were very knowledgable with Hondas. Saved me money from going to a dealership for sure, while still using OEM parts. Fast turnaround too. I caught the lite rail back home...very convenient!
5	Great people and service at a very reasonable price. They are all very knowledgable and get the job done quickly. The owner works there every day and is extremely trustworthy. I'll be bringing my cars there whenever I need anything done.
4	The building itself is rundown so you may over look the location if you are driving by. Definitely stop in though if you need work done. And not just work on a HondaI took my Saturn Outlook in for major service yesterday (preventative). Guys were quick, professional and nice.
