5	Wow, our cake was beautiful and our guests just loved the mini cakes.  We got pineapple and strawberry to go with our tropical beach theme and they were delicious.  Chelsea was so sweet and came up with such a fantastic and creative design, it was stunning.  I highly recommend Iced for Life to anyone who needs a cake
5	Our cake was for a Graduating RN!  It was perfect and tasted delicious.  Chelsea is a true professional and has the art of cake making down.  She is very courteous easy to work with if you have custom ideas. If you are in need of a custom cake, Iced for Life is the place to call.
5	Baby cakes are one of the greatest things ever. Period.I have gotten the chance to sample many different flavors and just enjoyed another batch before an ASU tailgate this past weekend. The owner is also really good about supporting the community, and I've seen her around at different events donating baked goods for charity. I don't think I could eat a normal cupcake anymore; if you haven't tried some of Iced for Life's baby cakes yet, you need to drop everything and give them a shot!
