4	They're open year-round and they have the full DQ menu, though I rarely stray from the onion rings. I used to come here so often that I started to get paranoid I was becoming known as "the blizzard guy."
3	Typical dairy queen except parking is a pain unless you risk it in the lot next door.  They charge 25 cents per 15 minutes with a minimum of $1.  Prices seem a little higher than other Dairy Queens.  They charge $4+ for a blizzard.  Not as many options on their blizzards as other Dairy Queens I have been to. Otherwise they have the same food and ice cream treats.  Service was quick and staff was friendly.
3	My grandma use to take me here when I was a little kid.  There is something about nostalgia that just makes food taste better.  The dip cones are solid and tasty and their hotdogs are served on a white bread bun which I'm amused by.  The food is decent for a Dairy Queen.
3	Extended hours to 10PM in the summer.  They now have smoothies/orange julius.  Previous comments stand and prices went up even more!
4	Look, I know Carson St has a million other places to eat, don't worry you'll have time to eat them all.  Whatever you do though, go to this location and order food, sit at the front window and eat and afterwards have that cone or blizzard.I have eaten here more times that 50 and I'll tell you 48/50 times my food was fresh, hot, made quick and always served with a smile. This is a huge secret of Carson.  You could eat lunch for $5.00!  Who can beat that.  Dinner might be $7 or $8 but whatever they do to that food, it always comes out tasting home made, not fast food.  Chicken Strip Baskets, BLT's, Shrimp Baskets, Chili & Cheese Fries, Half Pound Burgers, and Pepsi Products!  yes, Pepsi... not Coke Products.If I say anymore I might over sell it,just know it's well worth your money no different than any other place on that block for lunch.  P.S. My favorite flavored blizzard is Banana Cream Pie followed closely by Cookie Dough.
