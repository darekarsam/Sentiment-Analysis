5	George Washington sleeps here, so does Seneca leader, Guyasuta, right in front of the Grandview Pointe apartment building. "Point of Views" is a landmark celebrating the historic second meeting of both of these historic figures. This meeting took place in October of 1770, Guyasuta is featured with his back to the west, almost protecting it from George Washington. George is depicted with a determined look that he will take Pittsburgh to gain access to the west. This statue is located a short walk just west of the Duquesne Incline on Mt Washington.
