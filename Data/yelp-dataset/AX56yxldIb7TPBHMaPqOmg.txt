2	I love Port of Subs but this location seems like their ingredients are not as fresh.  The bread maybe is a little old but I am not for sure.  It stinks because this is my favorite sub sandwich place and when I go to the I-17 & Thunderbird or 19ave & Deer Valley location the sandwich is always great.  I always get the peppered pastrami on wheat with the mayo-mustard mixture (its addictive as crack).  So when I go out of my way to stop here when I am in the area it is a let down and yesterday was no exception.  I hope they improve things here so I can feed my addiction when I need to.
3	I used to go to this place all the time but it seemed to be run by drug smoking hippies.  You would order, they would lose focus, you would re-order, and it repeated.  If they got the order correct you would be amazed.  I ventured back and no more drug smoking hippies.  Service was friendly, sandwich was as ordered, and I only had to ask for it once.  Totally shocked.  I'm hoping the real staff wasn't just vacationing in Colorado and I just got lucky.   I'm actually going to go back and have another sandwich there so we'll see.
1	I paid $14 for the two worst smoothies I have ever had in my life.  All I tasted was powder.  The girls that worked there had issues with English and the concept of "dairy and egg free" in one of them.  I am almost positive they put dairy in that one because my throat started itching and swelling after about 1/4 of it.  My wife's tasted like "old bubblegum" and it was supposed to be chocolate.  Both were thrown out immediately.  They have the most ridiculously confusing menu I have ever seen and figuring out ingredients is a nightmare.  Stick to Jamba Juice
