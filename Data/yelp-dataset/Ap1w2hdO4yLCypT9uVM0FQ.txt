5	Jesse and his crew are amazing. I have had several jobs done by them which have all turned out great. They are extremely fast to respond, professional and very reasonably priced. Jesse has great design suggestions based on taste and budget. Whether its a quick cleanup or complete landscape redesign they can handle both residential and large commercial jobs.
5	Diversified did a great job remodeling my front yard! The owner of the company was personally in touch with me every step of the way to make sure that I was happy with the progress. They listened to my ideas and also offered great suggestions that took to project from good to great! I recommended using Diversified Landscape Management if you are looking for a professional group who gets the job done right the first time.
5	I am a Community Manager and have had the pleasure of working with Jesse at Diversified. He is absolutely willing and ready to do what it takes to make the client happy. With that said, he has taken one of our communities and literally turned it around for the better! If you are looking for someone to lead and give direction, look no further!
5	These guys did great work. Jesse and his crew removed about ten tons of old rock and dirt from my backyard and replaced it with river rock and sod. Great people to work with and they did excellent work. Price was right too.
5	Jesse and his team have done an amazing job with my yard. My grass, in both the front and back yard, look the best they ever have. I am so glad that I chose them to plant, seed and clean my yard. Thank you.
