5	Not much I can add to Emeline's lovely review except that I agree, Oscar's is candy-magical. You get a dreamy feeling walking around all that delicate spun sugar, careful crafting, whimsical packaging. Everyone is smiling because they can't help it. Even without a major sweet tooth I love me a dose of that, and it sure makes for gifts people love to receive. This place has been around for over 80 years if you can believe it, and they've survived the shifts in Montreal's candy landscape by seeking out exciting imports, small batch candy masters, and all kinds of new delights for their loyal and adventurous clients.
4	I am a HUGE fan of this candy store!!! If you are looking for hard to find, exotic, foreign or simply delish treats, Oscar is the place for you! This little store is filled with candies of all shapes and colors and coming for everywhere! I found amazing marzipan, the same I had as a kid back in Europe. You can also find pretty boxed candies that would be perfect for gifts. Beware that some of those can be extremely pricey. If you love candy, you need to try Oscar.
