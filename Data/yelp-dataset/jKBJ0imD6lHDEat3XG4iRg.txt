5	I have a flat garage roof, which has been troublesome for years. In 2010, I had Trades Unlimited repair it. They tore out the old roof, down to the plywood, and rebuilt it. Then they foamed it. That was three years ago, and I've had no trouble with that roof since. Flat roofs are really a problem, in my experience. Trades Unlimited did a great job for me. I recommend them.
1	Company really pumps up how wonderful they are and how they care for customers, yet do not stand up to their promises. They did a mediocre job with our roof leak and when we inquired about additional work they sent an incompetent referral to us who looked over job request and never came back. When we called them back they never returned our calls.  Very disappointed with what they deliver. Which isn't much.
