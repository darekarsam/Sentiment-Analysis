5	Very refreshing addition to the North Shore. My wife and I live downtown but enjoy the change of pace and ambiance of North Shore's Riverwalk which is mostly comprised of "sports bar" themed locations but Asiago's offers a (much needed) breath of fresh air. Upscale Italian with an excellent wine selection. I had the bittersweet salad and the mushroom ravioli with steak tips while my wife had the house salad tossed in homemade vinaigrette and the Tuscan chicken dish. Not disappointed. The food was amazing and our service from Trevor and Alyssa at the bar was great. Tip to anyone visiting for their first time: save room (which might be difficult haha) for their made to order doughnuts! Trust me you won't be disappointed.
4	Staff was great. Atmosphere nice. Eggplant Rollatini very good. Crab fettuccini Alfredo good. Bread and oil very good. White white glasses bad. I hope this restaurant has more success than the previous tenant in this location.
5	Great addition to the North Shore if you seek something other than a sports bar. I must avoid gluten so I ordered the salmon salad; it was delicious. Vince has been our server twice now and he knows the menu and how to pace his service. Their cheese cake was homemade and a generous portion. We can't wait until the summer when the patio opens up.
