5	This has been my doctor for years he has recently moved to a grand new office. But it is the same staff of great people. I highly recommend this office/ Doctor to everyone !!! He is thorough, accurate and doesn't have a problem taking his time to explain everything clearly !!
5	My only recommended eye doctor! Staff is very helpful, I drive all the way across town to come here.
5	My first visit with Dr. Coker was awesome.  He explained everything clearly, was very thorough and made me feel comfortable.  He is very professional and incredibly knowledgeable and very sweet,  just like Dr. Morrison. Both are great Doctors and we will keep coming back as long as they are here.
5	GREAT TO BE BACK !!!Dr. Morrison has been my choice for years until I had to move to the opposite end of the spectrum - Northwest area.Because of the distance, I decided to try an eye doctor at my location.  But I felt something missing. They lacked the genuine care & wisdom that Dr. Morrison & his awesome staff ( Mary, Shane & Karen ) provides.Their office is so welcoming.  Dr. Morrison is very thorough with the examination.  They carry a wide selections of glasses & contacts that will surely fit you. I feel so grateful for their wonderful service after all these years.Thank you so much !
