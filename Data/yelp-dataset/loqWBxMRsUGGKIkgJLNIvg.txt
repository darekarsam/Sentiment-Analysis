5	Prompt service! Knowledgeable crew. Not pushy about extras like some. Highly recommend.
5	This Valvoline Instant Oil Change location has a very knowledgable staff. Plus, every time I've gone in they have cut me some sort of deal, $7 off here - 10% off there, it is my preferred spot to go. Granted the other locations are just as friendly and quick.They are also able to make suggestions on other maintenance issues they don't cover and how to go about fixing them.Another big draw is that they will top your fluid levels off for free, once between your 3,000 miles towards the next needed oil change. I have a beater car and have used that benefit several times since I started coming to Valvoline!
5	They stayed late to complete my oil changeThe Asst Manager worked extra to fix my faulty hood-it wouldn't clasp without serious slamming.Quality jobOffered products but didn't push to make you feel pressuredFelt like I was in skilled & knowledgeable handsAsst Manager handled rush and closing of shop well and didn't affect customer service --or make me feel uncomfortable for being the last car of the day :)HIGHLY recommended!!
