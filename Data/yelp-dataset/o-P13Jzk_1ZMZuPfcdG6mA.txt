4	poundland is a nice and quite big shop in the st james centre.Its good because everything in the shop is a pound and its got a wide variety of things to choose from.
4	I love Poundland. A quid for everything! What a marvellous idea. I particularly like 24 Oxo Cubes for a pound. Everything you need is in this store, pants, toiletries, cat food, kitchen utensils... and all for a pound! One Christmas me and my friends did secret Santa from the pound shop. My friend bought me Feminine Hygiene Wash and a book on salt. I returned the favour with a book on different uses of vinegar. That sums up the quality of the goods in here. Fantastic!
4	Good old Poundland, whenever I go in for a browse I come out with a whole bunch of stuff I had know idea I even needed or wanted. It's particularly good at Halloween time when they go all out with decorations and you can decorate your room with fabulous items for you've guess it... one pound, the same items can also be found in other stores for a much higher price.In addition to novelty items, they also have a range of household goodies and food too and not just made up brands, they stock many household names.This particular branch is always choc-a-block, the people of Edinburgh don't mess around when it comes to snapping up a bargain. It's well stocked and even though quite chaotic, it's well organised and there's always plenty of staff on, just in case you're not sure of the price of something...
