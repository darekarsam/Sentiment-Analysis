2	Average run of the mill store.  Associates are young teens and they really don't know where anything is.  Luckily I am able to get around to find everything.  Found my puppy treats and moved on.
3	Not bad for a Shop N Save, most are privately owned, so availability of items might differ from place to place. The only time I frequent S n S is when the have their huge two day sales usually held on Thursday and Friday at least once month.Good bakery at this location too.
