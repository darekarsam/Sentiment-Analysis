5	Recently, I went to The Gold Guy store to ask about selling my old jewelry. I felt very comfortable when I walked in and after speaking to the person who worked there, I had no doubt that they were a reputable business.  I was offered a great price for my jewelry and agreed to the deal. I would happily recommend this company to anyone.
5	The Gold Guy is way more professional then I have every seen at any other gold buying store.   The team is very knowledgeable and they give the most money for jewelry then anyone else in the valley.   It was not a high pressure atmosphere which made me very comfortable!  Definitely recommend the gold guy.
