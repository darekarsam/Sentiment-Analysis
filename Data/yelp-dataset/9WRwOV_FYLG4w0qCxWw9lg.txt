4	A purveyor of all things fine in Montreal- Matt and Nat purses and bags, Soia and Kyo coats that go on sale seasonally and modern styles of clothing.  I've made some terrific buys at Mochico at this location, but if they don' t have the colour or size you need, they are more than happy to call around to find another one of the chains that may be able to accomodate you.  Super helpful bilingual staff.
5	I love this store! We visit Montreal regularly (my husband's French-Canadian), and I always go to this store to buy something. I bought 3 Soia and Kyo jackets here, one every year, as well as a couple of pair of winter boots. Highly recommended.
1	Service was great up until the point I had to return the shoes. The threads were coming loose on the pair which led me to exchange them. It took two weeks to get a replacement pair from the supplier even though it was part of their newest collection and somehow couldn't just grab a new pair from the stock room. Finally, when the pair arrived, I realized that they all had the same defect, at which point I decided to return them. This required approval from corporate so I had to wait another few days to get the approval, then come back to the store a third time to finally get my money back.All in all, I was initially happy that I had found a great store, however, given their sub-par quality of merchandise combined with snail's pace return/exchange process, I don't think I'll be shopping there anytime soon.
