4	I stopped in here because I liked the look of the place from the outside.  It lookd like a bit of a dive bar but not too scary.  Turns out I was right, inside was a comfortable, dimly lit space with a small crowd of people who seemed to know each other and the bartender.  There were some nice beers on tap including a local IPA I hadn't seen around town.  A local band was playing, it was nice to hear them without paying a cover.  I'd recommend this for a chill place to start or end and evening.
3	P'tit bar sympa, y'a l'air d'avoir toujours des p'tits concerts avec des artistes locaux ! J'y retournerai !
5	J adore ce bar, bonnes bieres, bonnes musiques, bonne ambiance, super friendly et cosy!
5	If you like the local scene you'll like this (mostly French speaking) bar. They feature local bands, improv groups etc. in medium sized space with old wooden chairs and tables. It's been around a long time. Good selection of beer on tap at not outrageous prices. Did I say it's dimly lit? Very chill place overall.
4	I was really surprised by this place.We played a gig here last night, we'd never been before. I am also not from Montreal so don't speak French, and was a bit worried I might get treated unfriendly as happens at the more francophone venues (as I was alerted this was). But that was not the case.Everyone was super nice. The venue is a great size. The sound guy/bartender was on point, really knows the place and did such a good fast soundcheck. The place filled up nicely. Very reasonable drink prices. And in a really cool part of town. Total great vibe and layout all round.Will definitely be returning to see bands, and also to play again hopefully.
