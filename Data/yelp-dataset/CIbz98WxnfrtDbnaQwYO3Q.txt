3	Lovely, simple cafe decor, great spot near mount royal park to bring a laptop and do some quiet work. I loved the healthy smoothy with berries here, and the grilled cheese with caramelized onions, and that mystery muffin that the waiter was unable to identify. The soup of the day was watery and a bit disappointing. The staff is a little haphazard and sometimes slow, but always smiley. The homemade truffles display is adorable.
4	This is one of those quiet little neighborhood cafes - a simple unpretentious interior, very nice coffee and welcoming owners make it an ideal spot to meet friends or get some work done.The coffee is a nice blend, always seems fresh and pulled with skill.  Both pure espresso and milk-y drinks seem to be executed with equal competence.  Food is somewhat limited but generally well above the typical coffee shop fare.  The baked goods, both sweet and savoury, have never failed.  The soups on the other hand, have had a mis-fire or two.  The first time I was there a vegan soup on offer was rich and comforting, same goes for the root vegetable soup - the misstep came in the one meat-y example I sampled which was a bit thin - almost tasting as if someone tossed a bit of water in the bottom of the pot to call it another serving. If you're in the neighborhood it is most definitely worthy of a stop-in.
