5	All around great experience. We were greeted by staff welcomed and helped ordering our pizzas. Our family has been papa Murphy's take and bake customers since 1997 and we were leery of others but my wife and I agree that this summer noble Romans will be our new family favorite! The sauce was flavorful and the ingredients fresh Mgr Kevin from Indiana really was an informative touch. See ya soon guys the pizza was "WOW"
2	We love "take-n-bake" pizza and was excited that another establishment opened near our home. Unfortunately, we will not be returning to Noble Roman's. We were very disappointed in the quality of the pizza. It was on the same level as an inexpensive frozen pizza from a grocery store. You may get unlimited toppings for one price, but you won't get very much of any one topping. I doubt there was more than a half of an artichoke heart on the whole large pizza.The only reason I chose to give Noble Roman's two stars is because they did have great customer service and were quick to answer any questions we had.
1	i went there thinking they had FRESH ingridients, when the lady brought out the crust it looked a bit dry and stale. she thossed it in the trash and tried another, then explained to me that the ingridients are shipped from indianna...for 15 bucks i got a pizza that i could have made a better one myself with boboli crust and cheese from albettsons.i wont go there again i make better pizza myself
