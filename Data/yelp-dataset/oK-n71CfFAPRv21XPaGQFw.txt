1	Nobody greeted me when I entered the bank. There was a black girl who just looked at me and say nothing. The employees are not friendly and helpful.
4	It is my humble opinion that all banks suck. With that said, I actually like the people that work at my Citibank. They are always friendly and very helpful. Even the security guard that usually stands outside is hospitable and talkative. I really wouldn't change a thing about this branch. All the employees here rock, and on more than one occasion, have gone out of their way to help me with any issues I have had. One star was deducted because they are a bank, all banks have some crappy policies. Nothing against this branch in particular.
1	at citibank. had a cd there for 5 years. earned about $6- $7 a year. bad investment choice on my part. pretty cheezy on their part. the day i matured i decided to pull it and invest elsewhere. they said they could not give me my money but the could give me a cashiers check and i could come back in a few days to cash it o.O . yea...it sounds retarded. it gets better though. 3 days later. here at the bank again trying to cash the check....their check...my money..real cash they have had for 5 years. waiting now for 45 min for them to verify THEIR check lol.  Am i missing something or does this sound like incompetent bs? hmm maybe they dont know what they are doing..or maybe they dont have the money...hope they are not running out of money...that would suck for people...or maybe they just want to create such a hassle that they think i will juat go away and they can keep my money?
