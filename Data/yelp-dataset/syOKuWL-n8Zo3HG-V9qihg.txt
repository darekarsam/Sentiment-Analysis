4	Great Service and knowledgable staff.
4	Dr. Leavitt has developed a really great treatment experience at his office. Comfort, safety, and competent treatment are at the core of his practice. Every time one of my clients comes from Dr. Leavitt's office, they rave about how great it "feels" there, the doctor and the staff make them feel so comfortable. To me that should be the goal of every medical practitioner and Tropicana West has it right. Thank you for taking care of my clients! I would recommend them to anyone in pain! Bummer they just have one location- they are doing things right.
5	I have been to a lot of Chiropractors in my life. I have suffered lower back issues for about 24 yrs. My wife found Dr. Leavitt for me. There is a vibe in this office that just works. I have never felt more concern at a Dr's office. This is by far the best of the best. They offer manual adjustments and electronic decompression. Their prices are very reasonable and appointments are very accommodating. I would recommend Tropicana West Chiropractic to anyone. 5 Stars! Best in Vegas!
