5	I love this place.  The setting is just like a real french brasserie bistro.   I am French and living in Boston, this is as close as it gets for me. This is now my new regular spot for a Stella Artois bear, tartare, choucroute and  what ever the owners put on this cool menu.   And for those of you who don't know the name,  it is a cult 60s french movie with witty lines and gangster lines.  Just go to the toilet and read the walls.  You will get in trouble if your try to repeat it.
