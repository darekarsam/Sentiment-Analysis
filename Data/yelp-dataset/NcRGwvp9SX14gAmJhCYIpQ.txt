2	Popular neighborhood chinese food joint with ample buffet. Started with take-out, then a follow up with a friend for dine in. My take out was fine--vegetables were done to perfection, chicken was recognizable as chicken, not some dressed up faux meat. Fairly generous with sauce--I like my food a little less with sauce, but thats me.Dine in was hit or miss; this could have been an off day. Some of the food was cold, all of it was very sauced.  Good variety of beef, chicken, seafood; not everything fried, which was nice. Some comfort food, green beans, etc., that I didn't try out, but it was good to know that they understand it can be hard to please everyone in a dining party.Not my favorite, but reliable.
