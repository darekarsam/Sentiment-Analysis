4	My grocery bill is about 1/3 lower than it was when I shopped at Copps. They don't have a huge selection, but for basic groceries they have most things. The prepackaged deli meats are excellent, much of the frozen food is great, and things like bread, milk, and eggs are very low priced and good quality. Everybody I've talked to who works there seems very nice.
4	You know what's cool? $3 wine. You know what else is cool? Progressive grocery stores that have creative incentives like no bags and return-a-cart quarter slots.This store has both and is all around a pretty fun place.It's definitely a discount grocery and doesn't offer a wide variety of brands, but that's why everything is so cheap!Check it out if you get the chance. I normally make it part of my commute home from work at least once a month.
4	I had been to Aldi overseas in Europe and Australia before seeing them pop up here stateside years back, and was pleasantly surprised.  I do like their business model, and as a consumer, if you know what you are looking for, Aldi can save you a ton of money.  Small things can be off-putting for those who like convenience:   needing a quarter for a cart, being able to use only cash or debit, and not having everything stocked year round (a lot can be seasonal, like fruits and veggies).  But, for budget shoppers, this is the place.  I've read a couple of things online about Aldi that is worth noting.  It's apparently owned by the same company as Trader Joe's (or it's brothers that own each).  Also, most of the food is just repackaged differently than named brand items from places like SuperValu.  I could go on about items I like to get at Aldi, but I'll just comment on this location.  Since it's newer than the Watts Rd. location, I found it to be bigger, brighter and carries more items.  It's also very clean.  Hyvee (which is great) is right across the street, so I find it very convenient to be able to go to both stores.
