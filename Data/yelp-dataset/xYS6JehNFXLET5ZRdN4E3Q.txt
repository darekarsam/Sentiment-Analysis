5	the flounder and sweet potato fries were delicious (so often chefs over cook or make fried food soggy - these were lightly fried....perfect. ) Being from NC,  the collards were the test...they measure up well and are worth recommending.   Farm to table is evident with how fresh everything tasted.  So much food...no room for the dessert! (but there's enough to tempt!)
4	Originally ordered the chicken and dumplings... Big mistake, tasteless, and definitely not what you would think of as a traditional dish... It was more like a thick soup with bone chicken mixed in with a small dumpling (as in singular)  awful dish and should definitely be looked into and tweaked a bit or taken off the menu. On a better note the service was great and friendly. The manager was quick to fix the order and get me something more appealing and appetizing. I ended up gettin a burger instead and was much better. Mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese are great sides as well.
2	This is a typical B scale hotel lobby restaurant. Nothing special.At lunch, they have a "flatbread buffet". It sounded good, but since I was the only person that was eating lunch at the restaurant, the flatbread was over an hour old and dried up under the heat lamps. They were not going to put fresh out since I was the only customer.The salad bar was ok, but VERY limited (14 items total).
