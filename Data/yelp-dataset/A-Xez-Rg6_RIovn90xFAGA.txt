5	This place is AWESOME.  Best egg salad sandwich I have ever eaten.
5	Awesome! Nice people! I just went in for my first time, got a BLT and it's great! I will be back.
5	This place is one of those low key hidden establishments in large business parks that serve to the surrounding swarm of computer desk warriors. The place itself is pretty nice with indoor and outdoor seating. Since it is a mom and pop sub shop they are extremely helpful and friendly. They have a soda fountain and a selection of chips (they have Ms. Vickie's) which is a bonus since it is a local family lunch stop. It helps that the food is pretty darn good as well.Nice, simple, fast, and local = a win in my book.
