5	Zach is a great trainer who helps you no matter what stage your at. He helps you achieve your goals and is a great motivator. He is flexible and willing to work with you. He doesn't have that macho attitude other trainers have. He's willing to go the extra mile if you are as well! :)
5	Out of over 5 personal trainers that I have experienced, Zach is by far the most encouraging, knowledgeable and offers advice so that you can work out and eat right on your own time.  The group workouts are great too, especially if you need the motivation to keep going.  He is great with kids too.  We sent our 10 year old daughter to him for agility training to help her with tennis.
5	I just had my first personal training session with Zach at Monroy Training! I was very impressed with his facility and felt right at home. I was nervous to get back in shape and I haven't worked out with in years, Zach went over everything with me so I would know what to expect and he did an assessment. I felt like I was in good hands the whole time. Whenever an exercise became to difficult he knew exactly what modification would help me push through and finish. Zach is very kind and soft spoken with a really positive relaxing energy, but he will push you to do your best. I will definitely be a regular client and would recommend him to anyone.
