3	The Colinton Inn is a pleasant traditional village pub with a well kept beer garden, it's perfectly situated for a having a quiet drink after a bike ride along the Water of Leith. The staff are friendly and professional, I'm always greeted with a smile and they're usually up for a chat and a bit of banter. Although the bar is not particularly well stocked, it's got most bases covered and it has a good selection of whisky, however I think it would benefit from a larger choice of lagers and real ales.The atmosphere is best described as quiet, friendly and local. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come here, but it's a decent enough wee pub.
