4	I am always on the lookout of a good poutine. Everyone has their idea of what makes up a good one, here is mine...Fries that are not too thick, not too thin, must taste potato like, not too greasy, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside with a little salt. As for the gravy, nice flavor, no lumps. Cheese on the bottom, then fries, then cheese, then sauce. God, I am a pig but if I am going to splurge, it needs to be worth it:)It's on Amherst in the Village, nothing special in terms of decor etc but it is always busy, the owners are very freiendly and the food is always good.Another thing... the poutine comes in a styrofoam bowl, which always makes it taste better in my opinion:) I am weird like that:)Anyway,  I always order the small, with extra cheese which they  put on the bottom, they cook your fries when you order and the counter is right infront of everything so you see it being made which I also appreciate. They do not salt their fries, so once they are cooked they bring me my bowl, so I can salt them, then take it back to the counter to finish making it.Their hamburgers are really good as well. They are no frill type of burgers, don't expect a multitude of special toppings but the meat is freshly ground on location daily, and all their toppings are crisp and fresh and the end result is a very happy mouth!Try them out if you are in the area. Oh, they are not open late, so check the website out for their hours.
