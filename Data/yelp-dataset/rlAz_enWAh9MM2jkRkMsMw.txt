3	This is my first stop on the way to the office in the morning for a few reasons:1- I get off the train, walk upstairs and it's right there.2- Free wifi3- Big, fat, comfy leather chairs (these are limited!)4- It's pretty big so there's always room.The staff is OK, though the manager (I think) Eric, is super friendly and always takes the time to chit chat with you - and if you're a regular, you don't need to tell him what you want because dude already knows.  They have a pretty good system set up to process orders but it is a very busy location, so you may occasionally have to wait if you've ordered a specialty coffee or food. The coffee is good. Nothing outstanding but good enough to start your day. They are one of the few places that offer both soy milk and lactose-free milk, which is a definite perk for me because I prefer real milk to soy in my lattes.Now, the down sides:1- Because it's near the train exits, it can get pretty damn cold in there. 2- Sometimes the music is annoying. Thank God for iPods.3- Non-patrons seem to think it's OK to come in, sit down and read the paper without actually buying anything. Hey - that's my spot and my paper you're stealing! 4- There's a group of regulars who think shouting is the new talking. They're really annoying so find a table on the other side of the shop!5- Recently, I've been graced with the presence of 2 people that I refer to as 'the porno couple.' I'm sure one of them is married or something - it's the only explanation for their very public make-out sessions. Seriously man - get a room!
