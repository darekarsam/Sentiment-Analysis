5	This is a really nice restaurant. I stumbled across it by accident. The food is great authentic Italian food and the service is friendly. We had an antipasti to share as they are quite large for a solo-starter. It was a platter of Italian prosciutto, salami and delicious cheeses. As a main dish I had a simple but very tasty pizza magarita. Also, the atmospher is nice. And the prices are more than reasonable considering what you get.
4	A very small and easily overlooked restaurant a little outside the city centre, but it offers you a very good Italian dining experience in a very cozy little dining room.
