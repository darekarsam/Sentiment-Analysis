3	Open warehouse like feel, seemed to have some big discounts (outlet store) on all the big ticket items. Not being in the market for anything specific, it was tough to tell if they were actually good deals or just fancy sticker markdowns. i was just checking it out to see if they had any steals on things i didn't need but couldn't pass up. Might be worth comparing prices if you're in need for a fridge, oven, treadmill, oven/stove,
2	Just to echo the other reviewers: inattentive staff and unimpressive markdowns. There's not much else to add to that.  They're conveniently located, for what it's worth.
1	It seems like such a good idea....sell items with small scratches at a discount. We purchased a stove from Sears Outlet with some markings on the glass part of the oven. Upon installation, we discovered the stove was leaking gas. After Sears took one month to repair the stove, they sent it back to our house. Or, at least they tried to. The installer noticed that the stove was so badly damaged (on another part) he didn't even put it on the truck. Sears is saying the stove is fixed now. Right. Because they failed to inspect it properly the first two times, they want me to believe the third time's the charm? The store managers have been completely helpless through this entire process; luckily we have leveraged sears corporate and the district manager for SOME semblance of customer service. Still ongoing with the stove.Unfortunately, at the same time we bought the stove we purchased a range hood. The quality was fine (so far) but the delivery process was so poorly handled that we ended up getting a 10% off coupon and cash back from Sears.So, I'm gonna go ahead and say go to Home Depot. Or Lowes. Or craigslist.
