1	Wish I could put negative 50 stars ,this place is horrible . They never have carts available as they are always locked a hard to get a key for ,staff is very rude and not helpful whatsoever...Find another place they are too expensive and inconvenient in every way possible when storing your personal belongings
5	My move in experience with Shelly (the new manager - apparently she just took over three weeks ago) was very good. She was very friendly, showed me the unit I was leasing and also how to get in the building, etc. A couple of critiques:- They seem a little understaffed ... the door to their retail / leasing area was locked during hours (staff were out and about doing tasks on property), but they came back as promised at the time listed on the door. Another critique would be their full price. The full price for my unit at $68 seemed high, but I got a good deal during a sale, so I won't complain about that.
5	Not sure what Natty K's problems were, but we have had nothing but great service at this facility while storing here.  Al and Joni are always helpful and great to talk with.  They have answers to all my questions and are always willing answer all my questions with smiles.  Will use this place again next time I need storage.
