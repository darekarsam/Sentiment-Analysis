5	Best batting cages in Gilbert or Queen Creek. It's a great way to get hits in without being outside. The staff is always friendly and accommodating. My daughter just started with a hitting coach at Grip & Rip & we already see improvement. Highly recommend.
5	Great place. Met the owner today who was very personable.  We will be returning no doubt! Support locally owned businesses. My boys Gavin and Garrett really liked the cages and facility.
5	Great employees, always nice, always helpful always. Able drop my son off and run errands with no issues. Nice clean well set up facility. They sell cold water Gatorade you can borrow bats helmets. Great place to come practice good value for your money.
5	Had a great time there today. Employee was very helpful!! Fun times with friends. Definitely recommend visiting with friends and sharing a lane for a super manly competition.
5	Visited this place with a friend and I was very impressed.  At first I wasn't sure what to make of the pricing structure (you pay for time, not balls - like $10 or so for 15 minutes I think).  But it's actually a great idea. You can hit a lot of balls and it allows you to reserve a cage in advance. There are about 4 good sized cages with pitching machines for both baseball and softball. You can also soft toss. The only downside is their hours - not open until 4 pm during weekdays.
