5	In the past 3 weeks, I've worked with Stephen Jurca on 4 different set of business cards. Each time he has been professional and courteous, even going as far as to hand deliver them. He has gone out of his way to make sure that I am 100% satisfied with every order. It is rare to find this type of service, so I would highly recommend Summit Communication Resources.
5	I have ordered several different business supplies from Steve and every time I am wowed by his dedication to go the extra mile.  Our business cards turned out beautiful and we get several compliments on the design.  The piece that sets Steve apart from other printing and promotional suppliers out there is his honesty, and dedication to offer the best product for our needs!!  I would highly recommend this company!!!!
5	Fast, friendly service at a price that is very competitive.  I needed an A-frame sign to advertise oil changes at the car dealership where I work. Summit was quick with a quote, and I shopped him at two other places I use for signs, etc.  His quote blew theirs out of the water!  I'm talking by like $60!  I'm very happy with the service and the product.
5	If you are looking for a creative way to market your business, Steve is the guy you need to talk to. He is very knowledgable and has a million products to choose from.  If you need anything printed, come see Steve, he's the best.
5	I have worked with Steve for almost 2 years and every time I try to get a quote from someone else to save money...I can't do it.  Not only are his prices competitive but the service...which I think is even more important...is outstanding.  From business cards to table covers we have enjoyed our relationship.  He not only gets stuff printed but he helps you to understand what will work the best for the particular situation.  No problem recommending him.
