5	I am so grateful to have found this place!  It's everything I've been looking for in a yoga studio since moving to Pittsburgh a year ago.  Wonderful, supportive teachers in a warm, inviting space.   The dimly lit atmosphere with candles burning and essential oils diffusing creates a perfect environment for introspection.   The music is always great, too (though occasionally a little too loud to hear the instructor, that would be my only very minor complaint).  It is a heated studio, which can be a little much for some people, but it typically only takes one or two classes for your body to acclimate to the heat.  I usually walk into an evening class with all the stress, tightness and aches of working at a desk the previous 9-10 hours, and after an hour and a half, walk out feeling light, rejuvenated and relaxed.Highly recommended if you're new to the practice or a seasoned yogi!
5	All I can say is I absolutely love Yoga Flow! The studio is so inviting and serene and yet the very knowledgable instructors will give you an intense workout. I leave feeling very challenged and  yet so relaxed. My favorite instructor is Suzanne on Monday mornings. I love the music she plays plus she is a wonderful and encouraging teacher. I am so happy I found Yoga Flow. The only thing I would change is the schedule to add some earlier morning classes. Highly recommend!!
5	I went to the Sunday 4pm class last week and LOVED it.  I have been to the Shadyside studio a few times and both studios are beautifully decorated.  I loved the teacher and she made an effort to make sure I was welcome and settled.  Loved the heat, learned some new moves to incorporate into my home practice (situps in eagle pose?! cool!!) and will definitely be back when I find myself in the South Hills on the weekends.
