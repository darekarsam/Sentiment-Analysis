5	My family, friends, extended family and I have been going to Dr. House since her early days in business at the Arboretum. Dr. House is professional, concerned about my well being, and very patient as she makes absolutely sure my contacts are right. Going to the eye doctor is always a very pleasant experience. I continue to recommend her to everyone.
5	After having an unpleasant experience both with the appointment and the billing of my previous eye care spot, I switched to Dr. Thomas because he was close to where I live, and what a wonderful experience.  I was taken for my appointment right on time.  Dr. Thomas was very personable and we got through my eye appointment.  For this trip, I decided to just get the lenses in my current glasses updated, but wanted a new pair of prescription sunglasses.  I got wonderful help from the young lady at the front who assists with that (I am terrible at picking out frames) and have gotten a lot of compliments on them.  I can't put into words what a painless, seamless experience this was.  From making the appointment, to the appointment itself, the ordering and picking up of the glasses, insurance and payment .... everything ran smoothly.  I highly recommend Drs. Thomas, House & Associates for your eye care needs.
5	After having a really bad experience at a previous eye care place I switched to Dr. House.  She was awesome!  She spent so much time with me trying to get the right contact lense power to improve my vision.  She was so nice, helpful and very patient. The front desk staff is always friendly and helpful.  I couldn't be happier with Dr. House and highly recommend her for all your eye care needs!!  A+++++
