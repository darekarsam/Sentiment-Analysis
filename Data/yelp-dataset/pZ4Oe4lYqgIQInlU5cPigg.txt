3	The food was as good as any other subway. what i like at this subway over others is that they put the sandwich in a basket when I told them I was eating in the restaurant. I never could understand why subway always gives the sandwich wrapped in paper and put in a bag whether you are getting it to go or not. It was a nice touch.
5	I've been going to this shop for years now, and it's definitely one of the better subways in the valley. A couple years ago I would not have said that, the service was a little poor and the staff was not friendly.However, more recently, this is my go to subway. I always see the same guy, Will, and he makes some perfect sandwiches. He's really friendly and professional, fast, and looks like he cares about his job. The store is always clean which is another plus. Like I said, great subway to go to if your in the area.
4	Clean restaurant, decent food and at a fair price.  One thing to note, I haven't been to this store in a few months and there was a guy making the sandwiches/salads that I hadn't seen there previously.  The store was relatively busy when I arrived and there were only two people working and the person I am referring to was an absolute pro.  I couldn't believe how fast and accurate he was making and handling all the orders.  Subway better do what they can to keep him, he was as good as I've seen in subway shops.
