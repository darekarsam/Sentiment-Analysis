2	Gas here is always a little cheaper than the surrounding Circle Ks. But you are in for the worst bathroom experince of your life...That is all.
3	On our way to downtown to do some ice skating, I noticed that my car was running on fumes.  Stopped in to get some fuel and water.  Had some issue with the credit card reader at the pump from reading my card; took 3 times for it to successfully read my card.

3	It's kind of amazing how every employee here is unpleasant. At least they are consistent.
5	My girlfriend always wondered where I developed brand loyalty to Circle K (she's a QT enthusiast) until we stopped into this place near where I used to live. They keep it as clean as any Circle K in central Phoenix can get, and the staff is consistently friendly and makes their best effort to keep the line moving when it's busy. The Circle K at 3402 N 16th St has much cheaper gas, but this place is much nicer inside if you need a Polar Pop.
