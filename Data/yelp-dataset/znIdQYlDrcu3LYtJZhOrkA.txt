3	The Matthews post office is a really really busy place.  Luckily there is one of the automated postal tellers located in the lobby so it makes it convenient and I try to avoid the long lines.The mail men/women are pretty friendly, but with the long hours and irate customers waiting in the long line... doesn't make many post office visits very fun.
2	Avoid this post office at all costs! It's too busy and unless you have a lot of time to kill, it'll take you forever and a day! This PO has two redeeming factors. Lot's of eye candy and a self service machine that you can do your own mailing with, but there's usually a long line there too!
3	It's a post office, so not much to report. Clerks and post office boxes. I just needed to drop off some stuff, so I didn't spend any time inside. There are drive up mailboxes around to the side, but then you're exiting out onto Charles Street in the back.On the plus side, there is an automated postal machine so that you can weigh your stuff and purchase postage with a credit/debit card. No cash though.
3	It's a post office! I only come here after hours, so I can report on the friendliness or helpfulness of the employees. I either drop off mail/packages or use the self-service machine. I never have a problem with either process. At some USPS locations, the postage machines fail to print postage, or the postage gets stuck in the machine. This one works just fine.
