4	Arrived around midnight and the front desk was ready for us, check in was quick and we were able to turn in. The room was clean, bed comfy, the desk was huge...but the bathroom was small. Breakfast in the morning was very convenient, several choices, and the coffee hit the spot.
4	Arrived late with two tired kids- nice, clean room with comfortable beds. Very convenient location near a mall and restaurants (Brixx at Foxcroft is good).Not a fan of having "elite" reserved parking spaces- Makes me envision mildly overweight guys in cheap suits and rented Chryslers with titanium Visa cards.
