4	This has to be the cleanest 99cents only store I have been to. Dunno if it's new or what but the items were stocked, employees were knowledgable with the items they sold, and there aren't any long crazy lines! They also have dairy products and eggs but not for a dollar. Walmart has those items for cheaper! Hehe sorry 99cents people gotta inform my peeps!Parking lot is big enough where you always get pretty close parking all the time. They take cash and card and they have 7lb bags of ice for a dollar! Wish I knew that during the hotter months, but now I do! :)
4	This is the only $0.99 store I will go to. It's clean and the cashiers are friendly. They have tons of items even though I don't want them I still buy them. And their seasonal aisle has gotten much better. I also noticed that their shelves have gotten taller which helps with them adding more items.
