4	I've got a few tattoos from here (all done by Israel). It's surprising to see that there are very few reviews on here given the business that frequents this place. However, the prices here are great and the work is decent. My fiance' and I have gotten tattoos that were simple names to entire back pieces. This place is reliable and there is no run around or issues making appointments. This is my "go to" tattoo shop.
5	Went there to change my dermal piercing out. They only charged me 10, quick , easy , friendly. Good atmosphere nice people.
5	I have lots of Ink..I've been in many shops in the Valley...United is the best, most family friendly shop and professional shop by far! United is a 'real' tattoo shop, no puffy yuppie BS - a real shop with REAL ARTISTS. ALL of the tattoo artists here are just that, artists - not some scratcher that came straight out of the garage. The work speaks for itself, stop by and browse some portfolio's. Rick, Israel, and Ed are all top notch guys. I go to Ed (a new addtion to the shop) for all my work. I'll post some pics! Amazing artist. check out his site (www.mckeonbrothers-ink.com)  as he keeps his portfolio online for you to view. No joke, don't trust some hack with your ink - it's forever!
