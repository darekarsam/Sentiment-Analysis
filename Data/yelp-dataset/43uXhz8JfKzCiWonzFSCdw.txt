1	1 Star? Absolutely. Here's why. 1: Service: Walk in, get stared at, never spoken to, stand at counter, get ignored, exit.2: Pricing. Why would I want to pay $25 for a polo shirt that will start to rip out under the arm in about 6 months when I can go to JC Penney's 2 blocks away at the Galleria Mall and buy a similar polo and an XLT t-shirt for $20 and still save $5? 3: Access. Getting in and out of this strip mall shoehorned into a tiny plot of land at the corner of Marks and Sunset is no fun. Especially when you get ignored when you go inside. In short your best bet is to just stay on Sunset and drive right on by. You can do better than this on price and quality.
5	Amazing service, Clarance knew my measurements purely from an estimate, he was engaging and we left having spent a good degree of our discretional money. Seriously good advice, seriously great service and good prices.
