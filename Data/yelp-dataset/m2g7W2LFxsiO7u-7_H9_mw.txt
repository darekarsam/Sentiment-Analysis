5	professional, friendly staff.  dr. adaoag is very receptive and knowledgeable.  comfortable office.  most comfortable doctor visit i've had in vegas thus far.
1	If there was an option to give no stars, I would. The front desk, as well as the office manager are a NIGHTMARE. The doctor was ok the first time I went, but once I had issues with his staff he was just as rude. Working in the medical field, I know the ins and outs, and this place was beyond rude and unhelpful. Switched doctors and I am MUCH happier.
1	Looks like this "Dr" always have something better to do...even when you are the first patient of the day you still have to wait 45 min so you can have 5 min of his time, and on those 5 min he tells you the specialist you need to see!! Really? Next time i will ho directly to the specialist! And save me the time and money with this one!! He took all those years at school to know what kind of specialist you need??? I was there for something that regulate my low blood pressure which is a family condition...but i have to go w the cardiologist first so he can tell me what i already know!!!!??? Really??? And also spend another 3 hrs of my time? No thank you...this is the last time i go with this one
