4	Nicky's gets four stars for their food. As far as appearance goes, this place is a hole in the wall (literally in between a dry cleaner and a weave store in the strip mall with bars over the windows) that hasn't been updated in ages and is a little on the dimly-lit side, but I look right past that. Owned by an old Greek couple, this place really falls into the mom & pop category- you can get a salad, burgers, gyro, BLT, seafood, bologna sandwich, even pork chops and country fried steak. They also have breakfast- pancakes, omelettes, country ham, corned beef hash, etc until 11:00 (I think). The food is great, and the prices are even better- lunch is usually under $5. I recommend the pita burger, cheeseburger (juicy fried patties with a soft bun that sops up the perfect amount of grease), or Nicky's Salad (which is HUGE for $5.75).
4	I had a burger and fries with a soft drink.  Food and service was good, and the prices were cheap.  No refills on drinks, and despite the window signs, no fried chicken.  A mom-and-pop operation, but one that i will occasionally visit.
5	The breakfast here is outstanding! Not to be mistaken by the appearance: food is at priced great and my breakfast sandwich had a heap of bacon. Looking forward to trying lunch here!
5	Great good, great service, started updating the inside! The food is always great! This is a family owned restaurant, and everyone is always great to deal with. I would recommend coming and trying this!
