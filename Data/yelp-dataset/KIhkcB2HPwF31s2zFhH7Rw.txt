2	I don't normally review fast food places. Raising Cane's have been popping up around the valley and since I'm a sucker for chicken fingers, I decided to try them out. The menu is simple: chicken fingers, fries, Texas toast and coleslaw (and a chicken finger sandwich.) I got "The Box" which included, 4 fingers, Canes sauce, fries, Texas toast, cole slaw and drink. When I got home and opened the lid, I immediately noticed the fingers were much much smaller than anticipated (about 3-4" long) The fingers  lacked flavor, were dry, and had way too much breading. The "canes sauce" had flavor, but very salty. The Texas toast- well it was just a thick piece of bread, nothing special.  So next time I have a craving for chicken fingers, I will go to my old stand by: Culvers!
3	My son is a fan of Cane's and that is where we found about this place. If you want chicken this is a place you can get chicken fingers. I know most think of chicken fingers as ground up chicken molded to look like a bar. Here is is white meat chicken pulled put if batter and fried. Chicken is the only thing you can get beside the sides that are available. There is a secret menu. I don't know how extensive it may be but I know if you don't want the batter on the chicken you can order it "naked". Since I am on a no carb diet that is how i eat it. Have been there two times and will go back when I am in the area.
