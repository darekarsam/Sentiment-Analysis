5	Oh no....I have a new addiction in Downtown Chandler. This store is absolutely beautiful. It is Christian themed, but it will appeal to anyone. I bought an amazing bracelet and some great gifts. The prices are very fair. They have jewelry, clothing for all ages, home decor and so much more. I spent an hour looking at everything. They just opened on 12/3/10. Check it out!
5	Pretty much in agreement with other comments - you can find some pretty unique garments, jewelry and home decor in this gem of a boutique in downtown Chandler.  DEFINITELY worth the wait [on your dinner tables] to check it out.
3	Another great little shop that has cool jewelery and accessories that are cheap but not too cheap (if you know what I mean).
5	My mom and I visited this store for the first time today and we were very impressed.Our family has owned similar stores in the past and we just loved the eclectic mix of art, and at very reasonable prices. (well we are Canadian so anything in Arizona seems cheap). I was especially impressed by their distressed furniture pieces that were very well priced. As well, the people who work there actually create a lot of the vintage jewelry they sell themselves, and do a great job of it. If you're looking for something inspirational or beautiful to decorate your home with, I would certainly recommend this shop.
4	This place is very cool for little treasures and fun gifts, and it has the coolest owner.  I met her while shopping one day, and I will have to say that the service in a business is critical as a shopper who doesn't like to be ignored until it is nearing closing time, and then all of a sudden here come the staff to let you know they are closing in ten mins (my sister's closet who also lock the doors with customers still inside-not actually legal ladies)  Service and selection of unique trinkets and fun accessories with a lovely selection for Believers.
