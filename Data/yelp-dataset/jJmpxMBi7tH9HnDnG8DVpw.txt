3	Nice little nail salon, good prices. (I took a picture of the pedicure prices and posted it here.)  You get a nice 5-7 minute leg and foot massage, and sit in a massage chair.  The staff was friendly enough, but I only gave it a 3 because it still irritates me when they talk to each other in their language.
4	I am not a manicure/pedicure expert, so my review is more about customer service.I decided my daughter might like something girlie so I took her for her first manicure and they were so patient with a toddler and made her feel special!
