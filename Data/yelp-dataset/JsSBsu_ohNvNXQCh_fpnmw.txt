5	What to say about a place where you can take care of two vices in one stop...AMAZING!  They have everything you need when it comes to alcohol or tobacco.  Not to mention that the staff here are super courteous and overly nice.  They did a nice job on reusing the building (once a Hook N Fish), sad though, there is really no use for the patio off to the side now.  But if you are in the Edgewood area and didn't want to have to fight your way to another place like this, it's very convenient.  Be sure to check it out.
5	This place is great!  Clean, friendly, and a very wide selection of beers.  Lots of parking out front.  This is going to be my "go to" place from now on.(Located in Edgewood Town Center across from K-Mart)
5	Seems to be family owned, you see the kids playing around or helping out. Friendly owner seems to know a lot about beer, but won't tell you about something he doesn't know. Clean, organized, and well stocked in both beer and tobacco.
