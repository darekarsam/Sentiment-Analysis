5	I love this studio!  So. Much. The hang classes (inversions and poses using straps connected to a wall) are great strength builders and not at all as scary as it might sound. Flow classes are equally as enjoyable and challenging.  My friends and I started here as beginners and are completely addicted to the awesome offerings at the Yoga Hangout. The instruction is the best part, in my opinion.  Rosa's classes are so, so good!  My experience with other instructors is also very positive.  I love that the classes are not overcrowded, the studio is clean, and the playlists vary from the traditional. The unlimited class pricing is like nothing I've seen before, and unquestionably worth every penny!
2	The secretary/front receptionist ruined my practice every time I dropped in.  I think being horrible must be part of her job description, she is a bitch and she's a bitch to my wife. Totally unacceptable.  I bought a Groupon, had a blast with the hang out classes I want to do more hang out classes but I will not be renewing. On top of that they never have the AC on so you're getting a hot yoga class when you're not expecting it.
5	Amazing experience . Teachers are great and super knowable. Rosa is one of my favorites :-) Namaste
5	As a runner, I have been looking for something during the day to accompany my workouts. I was very intimidated walking in, especially by the hanging straps. On a whim I asked if I could join the next class, Rosa, encouraged me to come. I was not disappointed. I admit I was nervous to hang, but easily my nerves took a back seat and my body was stretching in ways that I cannot do on my own. I hope the next month is as amazing as the first time.
