5	When I first linked up with Luis Camargo, I  wanted to increase my online exposure and social media presence. We all know that having a good website is only as good as how many people know that your website exists (that is where SEO and web design come in). No matter what industry you are a part of, Luis can help you be found online and overcome any SEO and Web Design obstacles you may encounter. With Luis in your corner you can count on concrete advise that could rank you organically at the top of Google, Yahoo and Bing for many of the keywords that suite your industry. Luis is an awesome and down to earth guy that cares about his clients and is 100% dedicated to their online success. I highly recommend him and his company to anyone out there looking to have a strong web presence.
5	I've had five different web "designers" in as many years...each one could do a few things well, but none of them did it all.  Luis Camargo has been a welcome change!  From the ground up, he built me a new website with everything I asked for and more... extras I hadn't thought of that bring ease and professionalism to my site.  I get compliments all the time!  And as I've continued to ask for adds, changes, and modifications Luis has not only accommodated those requests, but done so quickly and happily.  I don't feel guilty asking him to change things, and that's important for me because I know our website needs to be very fluid and flexible.  To have a web master who understands this is a luxury.  Highly recommended service!
