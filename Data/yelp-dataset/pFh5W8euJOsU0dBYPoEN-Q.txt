5	I seriously thought that "religious experience" hot dogs were only available in New York city or Fenway Park.  I was wrong.  Jerry, the guy who runs the cart makes an incredible dog.  While I was ordering people were coming up and telling him how good they were.  The "Jerry Dog" is easily the best hot dog I have had yet.  5 stars, dude!  Wow!
5	Newman and Marley's as it is known now is beyond amazing. The skinless weiner experience is like no other. You must get the pretzel bun...beyond religious experience. Big thanks to Jerry who is super cool owner and makes the cart unique. Put on your weekly to do list. Your taste buds will thank you.
5	I miss the reuben dog. Do they still do this?
