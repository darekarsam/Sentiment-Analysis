5	Excellent pizza, salads, sandwiches, and hand cut fries.
1	My friend got deathly sick after eating half a cheese steak hoagie. Never had, but that's enough for me.
1	Rude driver speeds down narrow streets radio so loud he can't even tell his boss is calling him to straighten him out. If that's how they represent themselves I will take my business elsewhere.
5	Glorious fried wings, sauce on the side. This is definitely their best item!Pizza is great, too, including specialty pizzas.Fast delivery in the local neighborhoods.Highly recommended
