5	Serena and Stephen are amazing! They are the perfect people to own a wedding shop. Serena was able to make my dream dress a reality. I had a vision of what I wanted for my wedding dress that took quite a bit of extra altering and Serena did not let me down! She is an amazing seamstress and she did a fantastic job fitting my dress perfectly to my body. She did everything she could to ensure I was happy with the end result. They were very accommodating to my needs. Not to mention all at a very reasonable price tag. I expected to pay a lot more for all the work Serena did. I am so thankful for her. I would recommend Yes I Do Bridal to any bride! You won't be disappointed I promise! Thank you Serena and Stephen!
4	Stephen and Serena are a wonderful husband-wife team. They are enthusiastic, earnest, and totally no-pressure about making a sale on wedding dresses. Some shops have consultants who go in with you while you undress; Serena does not, and I didn't ask her to. She was responsive about coming in to help me zip/unzip and clip the dresses I tried on. At the end, she encouraged me not to make a quick decision, but to think on it. They both are eager to discuss how gowns can be customized, either by the designer or by them. I'd recommend.
5	I love this place!!! I was desperate to find a dress and I didn't have much time and a limited budget. These 2 made it happen. They were so friendly and helpful. If it wasn't for this store I don't know what I would have done!
5	I had such a wonderful experience here. I would recommend this place to every girl that's looking for a dress. So helpful and very informative.
