5	SO very impressed with the student stylist I had, Chelsea is great! I got a relaxer, trim, blow dry, and straighten. I have had my hair done by various salons, and stylist however, this BY far is the best experience I have had. It's a little noisy (the students are young and having fun) but the work was great. I'll definitely be back!
1	Really annoyed. Tried to make an appointment to get my hair dyed and even though I have been to the locations in Tucson for the same exact thing they still would not schedule me for an appointment until after an allergy test where I would have to wait 24 hours. I already know I'm not allergic to their product since they have used it on me before. I know this is a beauty school and I'm aware of the risk of going to one so it's pretty ridiculous that I can't get my hair done on my only day off.
