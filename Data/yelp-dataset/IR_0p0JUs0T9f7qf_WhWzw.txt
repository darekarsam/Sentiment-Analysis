4	Half off my order and the impending game 7 of the NBA finals led me to order from Papa. Pretty surprising results as we went with the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza, pretty much the standard BBQ chicken with pineapple added. Should have got it well done, but somehow all the ingredients worked. Added on a $3.99 cinnapie and damn this thing was greasy, but good. Loaded with crumbly topping and lots of cinnamon, it was a worthy desert for this sort of place. Pizza here in about 20 minutes and nice delivery dude as well.

1	Ordered from papa johns when staying in Phoenix. The cheese pizza was to be well done and we were supposed to have cheese cups with order. No cheese cups and the pizza was burnt. Took over 1 hour to get the new non-burnt pizza and the cheese cups. At this point, the breadsticks which the cheese cups were for were extremely cold. Very disappointing. The driver clearly took more orders before getting our fixed pizza out.  Not acceptable.
1	Delivery took 2 hr, and I live just few block away from a store. Pizza was cold and pretty much waist of money.
