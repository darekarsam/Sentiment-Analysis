5	Croissants.... Who doesn't love the mix of crunchy and buttery smooth, melt in your mouth French pastry!I was in old Longueil staying at my cousins and got an early start to the day so I decided to take a stroll down the main drag to go pick up some breakfast. From across the street I could see a line up outside this pastry shop and told myself... "this can't be a bad thing"Upon walking in, this place was bustling with regulars waiting for their morning bread and treats. They offer a great selection but my visit had a sole purpose... croissants! The line, although long was moving quickly and I placed my order. A short walk later I was back at the house and time to break out the goods. My cousin and I both have a weakness for cross ants and this was croissant heaven!!! Even for a Montreal resident like my cousin. Crispy outside, melt in your mouth layers of buttery dough on the inside... Dipped in coffee or with peach jam, I just couldn't help myself. What was to be a light breakfast and croissants for the road ahead turned into somewhat of an over indulgence! Plus my cousin was so happy to fry the croissants from this place as she had never been!Now what are you waiting for, go try it! This place will be on my hit list every time I'm visiting Montreal and staying at my cousins house:)
5	This is a great place to hit if you're in Longueuil area and want something quick. They offer a wide range of delicious pastries and breakfasts. I had an amazing choco-orange french toast with an iced latte. The latte could have been better, since honey was all sticking at the bottom of the glass. Beautiful terrace facing the sun, lovely service.
