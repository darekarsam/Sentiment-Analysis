5	i haven't yelped for a long time but this place was excellent from the service to the wide selection on the menu. if you are in the longeuil area and looking for a good breakfast joint I highly recommend stopping by this place.
5	The coffee was dark and delicious. Went there twice, got an egg and cheese omelette that was amazing. The staff was friendly, and the place is quaint. Can't wait to visit again.
5	One of my spot for breakfast on the south shore of MTL! How about a different restaurant that serve delicious Cassolette and funky french toast. If you're feeling something sweet you HAVE to try their dark chocolate, ginger and pear french toast. Literally paradise in your mouth. The bread has the right texture and is full of flavors. If you're more into salty, the Cassolette with eggs and maple syrup sausage is the one for you.Downside was the coffee. People could describe me as a coffee connaisseur and I'm very picky when it comes to that. So def not the best here. Honey wasn't mixed properly in my latte, which made it way too sweet. Service was fast enough when I went and the staff was courteous. I'll come back and come back again!
