5	Great fades and prices
5	I walked in a few Saturday's ago and needed a nice cut, I went to Mike. He was very professional and gave me the cut I wanted and more. My other barber bailed on me at the last minute and I wasn't sure how my experience would go here. Its an older more established barbershop, I'm glad i walked in, because its a comfortable environment inside and close to my place in dtwn.. Wasn't too crowded on a Saturday either and gives you a down home barbershop vibe and def less big headed about there styles here...WILL BE BACK!5 STARS
