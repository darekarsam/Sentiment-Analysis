4	Everytime I have the munchies, I start fantasizing about some weird food combinations, but usually just end up eating spoonfuls of different condiments I can find in the frige. But last week, I found that perfect munchies food I've been dreaming of for so long! I got in this new shop/restaurant thinking that I would just get a banh mi to go, but then, I got super excited when I saw that they had funky asian flavours inspired hot-dogs and I seriously thought about ordering the three different ones. But after all, I got the seaweed and onions one as well as the tobiko and crab sticks one. I sat down and looked at my meal for several seconds before having a first bite. They were really tasty and the bread was soft. But be careful because it really is messy food, especially because they put a generous amount of spicy mayo in them. If you are into bold flavours and fast food, I'm sure you'll like it. I can't wait to try out the satay peanut butter hot dog!
5	This restaurant was absolutely incredible! They have the largest variety of food that I have ever seen. They have amazing and very authentic gelato, Vietnamese food, sandwiches, candy, bubble tea and more! Everything that I ate there was incredible. This place is going to be the next big thing (like Starbucks)! After eating at OMAI, all I could think was: OMAI god how good is this food!
